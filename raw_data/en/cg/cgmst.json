Our FY 2024 Budget request includes $15.9 billion to support HRSA's vital work to expand acce ss to health care services in the communities that need them most; grow, diversify, and promote the well -being of the health workforce; reduce maternal mortality; invest in rural health ; and increase access to behavioral health care. Providing Health Car e in Underserved and Rural Communities : In thousands of historically underserved and rural communities across the country, HRSA -funded health centers provide primary care services regardless of patients' ability to pay. Through these investments, HRSA helps communities improve their health and well- being, prevent and manage chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension; and care for children, families and individuals with low -incomes, individuals experiencing homelessness, individuals with HIV and ot hers who otherwise would not have access to a usual source of care. At the end of F Y 2023, the mandatory funding that provides about two- thirds of the health center budget is set to expire. The FY 2024 Budget prioritizes sustaining this vital health care lifeline, renewing the expiring health center mandatory funding, and building on it by expanding health center behavioral health services , extending operating hours , and adding new locations to care for more patients. Growing the Health Care Workforce : The Budget also focuses on renewing and extending funding for the vital mandatory health care workforce programs - the National Health Service Corps and the Teaching Health Center GME Program - that support the recruitment and development of clinicians t o deliver community- based care through loan repayment, scholarships, and residency training. Health care workforce needs are a pressing challenge across the country and the Budget makes a number of important investments to help - including dedicated resou rces to support innovative workforce programs, grow the nursing workforce , and modernize health workforce training. For example, the Budget would launch a new initiative to jumpstart innovation and support creative, new approaches to workforce development and training . It also includes increased funding to expand the nursing workforce by recruiting and supporting the nurse faculty and clinical preceptors necessary to grow the next generation of nurses and to increase the number of Certified Nurse Midwives to expand maternity care options. The Budget also reflects our focus on growing the behavioral health workforce by making significant investments in training health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists , clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, counselors, and peer support specialists. Addressing the Maternal Mortality Crisis : The maternal mortality rate for Black women is nearly three times the rate for White women, and the Budget includes several initiatives to help Page 2 respond to this unacceptable disparity in health outcomes. In addition to increasing the number of Certified Nu rse Midwives, new investments include growing, training and employing community -based doulas to provide direct support before, during, and after childbirth. Other initiatives focus on social determinants of maternal health, including screening and connect ion to services, expanding uptake of evidence -based models of maternity care, investment in state data collection and innovation to improve local response strategies, and growing the recently launched maternal mental health hotline. Supporting Rural Healt h: As rural communities work to sustain the health care infrastructure and face growing needs , the Budget makes a number of critical and timely investments to support rural communities. Targeted opioid and substance use disorder response dollars will expand our efforts to establish medication and treatment services in rural communities that are often not served by other programs. These efforts complement the Budget proposal to create a pathway for HRSA to support behavioral health services in rural heal th clinics. The Budget would also continue to support maternal health services in rural communities to help address the loss of hospital obstetric services that are occurring. To address the larger health care system sustainability challenges that many r ural communities are facing, the Budget would support technical assistance to help rural hospitals evaluate and improve their finances as well as develop or enhance their service lines to strengthen care delivery in their community. Meeting Behavioral Hea lth Needs : At a time of considerable demand for mental health and substance use disorder care, HRSA's Budget makes strategic investments to improve access to these life -saving and life -sustaining services. As noted above, the Budget would increase mental health and substance use disorder care in community health centers across the country; sustain the historic numbers of National Health Service Corps members - including behavioral health providers - practicing in high need communities in return for loan r epayment or scholarships; invest in training new behavioral health providers; support maternal mental health through tools like the maternal mental health hotline; and prioritize behavioral health needs in rural communities. We look forward to work ing wit h Congress on the Budget and its implementation, including these essential programs and initiatives serv ing the nation's highest need communities.

The Highlights section below groups key program performance measures by HRSA's goals and includes anticipated measure targets for fiscal year (FY) 2024. Highlights HRSA Goal: Take actionable steps t o achieve health equity and improve public health. HRSA programs leverage community partnerships and stakeholder collaborations to promote overall health and disease prevention across the populations served through HRSA programs and support diversity, equ ity, and inclusion for HRSA funding recipients. In FY 2024, 525,000 unique individuals will receive direct services through Federal Office of Rural Health Policy Outreach grants, which improve rural health through community coalitions and evidence -based models by focusing on quality improvement, health care access, coordination of care, and integration of services. In FY 2024, HRSA expects to have 166,643 cord blood units from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations available through the C.W. Bi ll Young Cell Transplantation Program, increasing the likelihood of finding suitably matched donors among these populations with a high rate of diversity in tissue types. In FY 2024, the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant program will contribute to decreasing the ratio of the Black infant mortality rate to the White infant mortality rate from 2.4 to 1, to 2 to 1 HRSA Goal: Improve access to quality health services. HRSA programs support the direct delivery of health services and heal th system improvements that increase access to health care and help reduce health disparities. In FY 2024, the Health Centers Program expects to sustain health centers' provision of affordable, accessible, quality, and cost -efficient care to 3 3.5 million patients. The MCH Block Grant program aims to contribute to the reduction of the national infant mortality rate from 5.4 per 1,000 to 5.3 per 1,000 , in FY 2024 by funding state maternal and child health activities to improve the health of moth ers, children, and families, particularly among low -income mothers and families or those with limited availability of care. 18 In FY 2024, HRSA forecasts serving 24,000 new clients under the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. HRSA will continue its contribution to reducing AIDS -related mortality for low -income and uninsured people living with HIV/AIDS by ensuring the provision of HIV medications and related services to 289,000 persons in FY 2024 through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. HRSA anticipates that in FY 2024, 85 percent of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program clients receiving HIV medical care and at least one viral load test will be virally suppressed. To increase the number of patients from racially and ethnically divers e backgrounds able to find a suitably matched unrelated adult donor for their blood stem cell transplants, the Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Program calculates that it will have nearly 4.02 million adults on the donor registry in FY 2024 from underrepres ented racial or ethnic populations. The Organ Transplantation program projects that it will facilitate the transplantation of more than 33,994 deceased donor organs in FY 2024. HRSA anticipates that 2,150 providers will provide Medication -Assisted Treatment through the Rural Communities Opioid Response program in FY 2024. HRSA Goal: Foster a health workforce and health infrastructure able to address current and emerging needs . HRSA works to improve the health care system by bolstering the healthcare workforce through provider placement, retention, and training activities. HRSA also will seek to advance the resiliency of the health workforce and improve the supply, geograph ic distribution, and diversity of the health workforce. HRSA's Bureau of Health Workforce aims to increase the percentage of completers of its supported health profession training programs who are underrepresented minorities and/or from disadvantaged bac kgrounds to 48 percent in FY 2024. Additionally, BHW plans for 40 percent of individuals supported by its programs who complete primary care training programs to be employed in underserved areas. Performance Management Performance management is central to the agency's overall management approach and HRSA routinely uses performance -related information to improve HRSA's operations and those of its grantees. As the key element of the performance management process, HRSA Senior Staff establish 19 annua l fiscal year performance plans, including metrics and indicators of success, directly linked to implementation of the HRSA Strategic Plan and additional priorities, as appropriate. Regular performance reviews take place several times a year between Sen ior Staff and the Administrator/Deputy Administrators, including during regularly scheduled one -on-one meetings, mid -year and year -end Senior Staff performance reviews, and ad hoc meetings to address emerging issues.

FY 2024 Community Health Center Fund Authorization (mandatory) ...... Expire s end of FY 2023 Allocation Method ................................ ....................... Competitive grants/cooperative agreements Program Description For more than 50 years, health centers have delivered affordable, accessible, quality, and cost - effective primary health care to patients regardless of their ability to pay. During th at time, health centers have become an essential primary care provider for millions of people across the country. Health centers advance a model of coordinated, comprehensive, and patient -centered primary health care, integrating a wide range of medical, d ental, behavioral health, and patient support/enabling services. Today, approximately 1,400 health centers operate nearly 15,000 service delivery sites that provide care to approximately 30 million patients across every U.S. State, the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Basin. FY 2022 Final Funding $3,905,348 $3,905,348 Proposed Law Mandatory 690 +60 71 HRSA in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed the Health Center COVID -19 Vaccine Program to directly allocate COVID -19 vaccines to HRSA - supported heal th centers , to ensure our nation's underserved communities and those disproportionately affected by COVID -19 are equitably vaccinated against COVID -19. Through this program, millions of people living in the nation's medically underserved communities and those disproportionately affected by COVID -19 have received vaccines. In addition, HRSA provided at -home self -tests, point of care testing equipment and supplies, and National Institute for Occupational Safety approved N95 respirator masks for health center patients and individuals in their communities. HRSA, in partnership with HHS partners, also administer a program to directly allocate oral antiviral pills for the outpatient treatment of mild to moderate COVID -19 in health centers. Health centers contin ue to deliver high quality and value -based care by using key quality improvement practices, including health information technology. Seventy -eight percent of health centers are currently recognized by national accrediting organizations as Patient Centered Medical Homes - an advanced model of patient -centered primary care that emphasizes quality and care coordination through a team based approach to care. Populations served: Health centers serve a diverse patient population. In 2021: People of all ages: Approximately 29 percent of patients were children (age 17 and younger); approximately 11 percent were 65 or older. Over 62 percent were adult patients (18-64), an increase of 1.7 percent. People in poverty: Approximately 90 percent of health center patients are individuals or families living at or below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines as compared to approximately 27.5 percent of the U.S. population. Health insurance status: Over 20 percent were without health insurance. Those patients that are insured are covered by Medicaid (48%), Medicare (11%), other public insurance (1%), or private insurance/marketplace (20%). Special Populations: More than one third of health centers receive d specific funding in FY 2022 to provide primary care services for certain special populations including individuals and families experiencing homelessness, agricultural workers, those living in public housing, and Native Hawaiians. H ealth centers served nearly 1.3 million individuals experiencing homelessness, almost 1 million agricultural workers and their families, approximately 5.7 million people living in or near public housing, and almost 6,800 Native Hawaiians. o Health Care for the Homeless Program: The Health Care for the Homeless Program supports coordinated, comprehensive, integrated primary care including substance use disorder and mental health services for homeless persons in the United States, serving patients that live i n unsheltered locations, in shelters, or in transitional housing. In 2021, HRSA -funded health centers provided primary care 72 services for nearly 1.3 million persons in supportive housing and/or experiencing homelessness. o Migrant Health Center Program: The Migrant Health Center Program supports comprehensive, integrated primary care services for agricultural workers and their families, with a particular focus on occupational health and safety. HRSA -funded health centers provided primary care services fo r over 1 million migratory and seasonal agricultural workers and their families, nearly half of the estimated 2.2 million active migratory and seasonal agricultural workers in the United States. o Public Housing Primary Care Program: The Public Housing Primary Care Program increases access for residents of public housing to comprehensive, integrated primary care services by providing services that are responsive to identified needs of residents and in coordination with public housing authorities. Health centers deliver care at locations on the premises of public housing developments or immediately accessible to residents. HRSA -funded health centers provided primary care services for nearly 5.7 million people living in or near public housing. o Native Hawaiian Health Care Program: The Native Hawaiian Health Care Program, funded within the Health Center Program, improves the health of Native Hawaiians by making health education, health promotion, and disease prevention services available through a combi nation of outreach, referral, and linkage mechanisms. Services provided include nutrition programs, screening and control of hypertension and diabetes, immunizations, and basic primary care services. Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems provided medical an d enabling services to nearly 6,800 people. Allocation Method: Public and non -profit private entities, including tribal, faith -based , and community -based organizations are eligible to apply for funding under the Health Center Program. New health center grants are awarded based on a competitive process that includes an assessment of need and merit. In addition, health centers are required to compete for continued grant funding to serve their existing service areas at the completion of every project perio d (generally every 3 years). New Health Center Program grant opportunities are announced nationally, and applications are reviewed and rated by objective review committees (ORC), composed of experts who are qualified by training and experience in particula r fields related to the Program. Funding decisions are made based on ORC assessments, announced funding preferences and program priorities. In making funding decisions, HRSA applies statutory awarding factors including funding priority for applications se rving a sparsely populated area; consideration of the rural and urban distribution of awards (no more than 60 percent and no fewer than 40 percent of projected patients come from either rural or urban areas); and continued proportionate distribution of fun ds to the special populations served under the Health Center Program. Patient Care: The number of health center patients served in 2021 was 30.2 million; an increase of nearly 10 million, or 49 percent, above the 20.2 million patients served in 2011. Of 73 the 30.2 million patients served and for those for whom income status is known, appr oximately 90 percent were at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level and approximately 20 percent were uninsured. Success in increasing the number of patients served has been due in large part to increased Health Center Program investments in th e development of new health centers, new satellite sites, and expanded capacity at existing clinics. From FY 2016 through FY 2019, HRSA invested $540 million in targeted, ongoing annual grant funding for the expansion of substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health (MH) services in health centers. These ongoing annual investments remained in health center continuation awards in FY 2022 and are projected to continue in future fiscal years. This funding supports health centers in implementing and advanci ng evidence -based strategies to expand access to quality integrated SUD prevention and treatment services, including those addressing opioid use disorder (OUD) and other emerging SUD issues, to best meet the health needs of the population served by each he alth center; and/or to expand access to quality integrated mental health services, with a focus on conditions that increase risk for, or co -occur with SUD, including OUD. Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) Program: The Health Center Program administers t he FTCA Program, under which participating health centers, their employees and eligible contractors may be deemed to be Federal employees qualified for medical malpractice liability protection under the FTCA. As Federal employees, they are immune from sui t for medical malpractice claims while acting within the scope of their employment. The Federal Government assumes responsibility for such claims. In addition, the FTCA Program supports risk mitigation activities, including reviews of risk management pla ns and sites visits as well as risk management technical assistance and resources to support health centers. The enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act in December of 2016 extended liability protections for volunteers at deemed health centers under the F TCA Program. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Health Center Program is $7.1 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion above the FY 2023 Enacted Level and proposes a pathway to doubling the program's funding with a critical three -year down payment on this goal. This total consists of $1.9 billion in discretionary resources and includes $5.2 billion in mandatory funding. Current mandatory resources of $4 billion for each fiscal year expire at the end of FY 2023. As a result of this expanded investment, approximately 3 mil lion more patients will be served by health centers in FY 2024 . All health centers will have the funding necessary to provide mental health and substance use services and expand hours of operations . HRSA will also be able to award grants to hundreds of new health center sites to address barriers to primary care for high - need communities. Mandatory Funding The Budget propos es to require that all health centers provide mental health and substance use disorder services under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. Currently, health centers are meeting approximately 27 percent of the estimated demand for mental health services, and 74 approximately six percent of the estimated demand for substance use disorder services among their patients. The new mandator y funding included in the Budget will provide resources to implement th is new requirement . Specifically , HRSA proposes to more than double the current Health Center Program investments in behavioral health services through a new $700 million behavioral hea lth service expansion funding opportunity to support expanded behavioral health services in the nearly 1,400 existing health centers across the country. The Budget will also support increased hours of operations. Extended or weekend hours are proven met hods for increasing access to necessary primary health care services for medically underserved populations, including for those who work nontraditional hours, live in rural or remote areas, or face other obstacles to primary health care. In addition, expa nded hours of operations also help prevent unnecessary and more expensive visits to hospital emergency rooms or urgent care centers. To address these needs, HRSA proposes a new $250 million investment to extended hours for health centers. In FY 2024, HRS A will also fund a new access point competition for new health center organizations and sites. Up to 24 million individuals below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level are experiencing significant primary medical care access barriers. Increasing access to the health center model of care in these high need areas will assure that medically underserved populations have access to affordable, comprehensive, high quality primary health care services. HRSA proposes to invest $150 million in a New Access Point Funding opportunity targeted to areas of highest need using an evidence based, transparent methodology. There is significant need and demand for a New Access Point competition across the country, as the last such funding opportunity was held in FY 2019 an d HRSA was only able to fund 75 out of more than 550 applications. The Budget will support approximately 230 new access point awards. FY 2024 FY 2025 FY 2026 billion $6.34 0 billion $7.51 0 billion Discretionary Funding As part of the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative, the HRSA Health Center Program provides HIV testing and prevention services, HIV care and treatment where appropriate, and assists with responding quickly to HIV cluster detecti on efforts. The HRSA Health Center Programs' primary focus in the EHE initiative is on expanding HIV prevention services, including outreach, care coordination, and access to Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) -related services to people at high risk for HIV t ransmission through selected health centers in the identified jurisdictions. In FY 2024, the Budget includes a total of $172 million, an increase of $15 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level, which will support the total participation of approximately 4 00 health centers in the EHE initiative targeted jurisdictions. The Health Center Program will continue to provide prevention and treatment services to people at high risk for HIV transmission, including Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) -related services, ou treach, and care coordination through new grant awards in areas currently served by health centers. The FY 2024 Budget provides a total of $85 million, an increase of $55 million, to support the expansion of early childhood screening and development (ECD) services in 275 additional health 75 centers. Children undergo rapid physical, cognitive, linguistic, and emotional growth and development at this stage, and screening efforts help identify developmental or behavioral conditions, language delays, or other ne eds, such as food insecurity and housing instability, that can contribute to gaps in school readiness and impact a student's ability to succeed. Health centers that receive these awards will use the funding to strengthen their capacity to provide more chi ldren with recommended developmental screenings and follow -up services, including by developing the health center workforce necessary to deliver these services and focusing on the patient and caregiver experience. Health center recipients of ECD funding m ay increase capacity to provide ECD services through training of current staff and/or hiring or contracting with additional staff with ECD expertise. The Budget includes a total of $20 million to support targeted cancer screening awards in 20 additional h ealth centers under the Alcee L. Hastings Cancer Screening Program. The program focuses on leveraging outreach specialists and patient navigators to conduct patient outreach in underserved communities served by health centers to promote early detection of cancer, connect patients to screening services, and provide hands -on assistance with accessing high quality cancer care and treatment as needed, in partnership or coordination with National Cancer Institute (NCI) -designated Cancer Centers. The Budget al so supports $120 million for the FTCA Program, which is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. The request supports costs associated with the grant review and award process, operational site visits, information technology, and other program support costs. Health centers continue to be a critical element of the health system, largely because they can provide an accessible and dependable source of high quality, affordable, and cost -effective primary health care services in underserved communities. Health c enters emphasize coordinated primary and preventive services that promote reductions in health disparities for low income individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, rural communities, and other underserved populations. Health centers place emphasis on the coordination and comprehensiveness of care, the ability to manage patients with multiple health care needs, and the use of key quality improvement practices, including health information technology. The health center model also addresses geographic, cultural, linguistic, and other barriers through a team based approach to care that includes physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, dental providers, midwives, behavioral health care providers, social workers, and health educators. Health centers also reduce costs to health systems; the health center model of care has been shown to reduce the use of costlier providers of care, such as EDs and hospitals. In 2016, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health evaluated the total annual health care use and total health care spending of Medicaid (fee -for-service) patients seen at health centers versus those seen at non -health center settings.11 This study found that patients seen at a health center had lower he alth care utilization and spending across all services when compared to non -health center patients. This included 33 percent lower spending on specialty care, 25 percent fewer inpatient admissions, and 24 percent lower total spending overall. Specifically, Medicaid FFS 11 Nocon, Robert S. et al. \"Health Care Use and Spending for Medicaid Enrollees in Federally Qualified Health Centers Versus Other Primary Care Settings\" American Journal of Public Health, Nov 2016 76 patients seen at a health center saved nearly $2,400 in total health care spending per year when compared to those seen in a non -health center setting. The FY 2024 Budget supports the Health Center Program's achievement of its performance targets, including goals on access to affordable, accessible, quality, and cost -effective primary health care services, and the improvement of health outcomes and qualit y of care. The Health Center Program has established ambitious targets for FY 2024, and has added measures for depression screening, HIV linkage to care, and the provision of substance use disorder services. The Health Center Program will continue to p romote efficient, value -based care, and aims to maintain the ratio of 1,734 medical patients per medical physician. The FY 2024 Request also supports efforts to improve the value, quality, and program integrity in all HRSA -funded programs that deliver dire ct health care. Health centers annually report on a core set of clinical performance measures that are consistent with Healthy People 2030, and include: immunizations; prenatal care; cancer screenings; cardiovascular disease/hypertension; diabetes; weigh t assessment and counseling for children and adolescents; adult weight screening and follow up; tobacco use assessment and counseling; depression screening and follow -up; dental and colorectal cancer screening. In addition to tracking core clinical indicators, health centers report on health outcome measures (low birth weight, diabetes, and hypertension) by race/ethnicity to demonstrate progress towards eliminating health disparities in health outcomes. To support quality improvement, the Program will continue to facilitate national and State -level technical assistance and training programs that promote quality improvements in health center data and qu ality reporting, clinical and quality improvement, and implementation of innovative value -based, quality activities. The Program continues to promote the integration of health information technology into health centers through the Health Center Controlled Network Program to assure that key safety -net providers are able to advance their operations through enhanced technology and tele -health systems. HRSA also utilizes a variety of methods to oversee the Health Center Program and to monitor Health Center P rogram grantees to identify potential issues, including non -compliance with program requirements and areas where technical assistance might be beneficial. HRSA accomplishes this monitoring through a variety of available resources, including the review of health center data reports, independent annual financial audits reports, ongoing communication with grantees, and site visits. HRSA's efforts to strengthen evidence -building capacity in the Health Center Program include recent enhancements and moderniza tion to the Uniform Data System (UDS). In FY 2024, health centers will begin reporting de -identified patient level data to further improve the delivery of care and develop more targeted interventions to improve health outcomes. The Program will continue to work closely with the Department of Justice on the FTCA Program. Additionally, the proposed Budget supports coordination with programs in the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Education, and Justice to maximize the impact and efficient use of federal resources. 77 The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Supplemental Funding FY 2020 $5,170,000,000 --- Program Accomplishments In 2021, health centers served 30.2 million patients, an increase of approximately 1.6 million patients, or 6 percent from Calendar Year (CY) 2020. Health centers served one in every eleven people living in the United States and provided approximately 124 million patient visits ( a 9 percent increase from CY 2020) . In 2021, about 42 percent of all health centers served rural areas providing care to over 9.5 million patients. Patient services are supported through Federal Health Center grants, Medicaid, Medicare, Children's Health I nsurance Program (CHIP), other third -party payments, self -pay collections, other Federal grants, and State/local/other resources. Health centers have performed a critical role in the U.S. response to the COVID -19 pandemic, while continuing to provide high quality primary health care services for the nation's underserved and vulnerable populations. Health centers successfully expanded telehealth and introduced new critical service lines, including COVID -19 testing, vaccinations, and treatment. In 2021, he alth centers reported increased levels of medical visits (6.5 percent), mental health (7.5 percent), enabling services (10.8 percent), vision care (25.5 percent), and oral health (21.5 percent). Despite treating a sicker, poorer, and more diverse population than other health care providers, health centers exceeded numerous national averages and benchmarks in 2021, including the Healthy People 2030 objective baselines for dental sealant services, HIV linkage to care, and hypertension control. In 202 1, 89 percent of health centers met or exceeded the Healthy People 2030 hypertension control baseline, 71 percent met or exceeded the dental sealant baseline, and 66 percent met or exceeded the HIV linkage to care baseline14. Health centers also reduce costs 12 FY 2022 reflects the post -sequestration amount of current law mandatory funding. 13 FY 2023 reflects the post -sequestration amount of current l aw mandatory funding. 14 HP2030 objectives: https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives -and-data/browse -objectives 78 to health systems; the health center model of care has been shown to reduce the use of costlier providers of care, such as emergency departments and hospitals15. Patient Care : Health centers focus on integrating care for their patients across the full range of services - not just medical but services like oral health, vision, and pharmacy as well. Health centers also deliver crucial services such as case management, transportation, and health education, which enable ta rget populations to access care. Nearly 93 percent of health centers provide dental services either directly or via contract. In 2021, health centers provided oral health services to approximately 5.7 million patients, an increase of over 40 percent since 2011. Screening for substance use disorders has increased over 100 percent since 2016, with the number of patients receiving screening, brief intervention, referral and treatment (SBIRT) increasing from 716,677 in 2016 to 1,484,857 in 2021. From 2016 -2021, the number of health center providers eligible to prescribe medication assisted treatment (MAT) increased 422 percent (from 1,699 in 2016 to 8,869 in 2021) and the number of patients receiving MAT increased 372 percent (from 39,075 in 2016 to 184,379 in 2021). Improving Quality of Care and Health Outcomes: Health centers continue to provide quality primary and related health care services, improving the health of the Nation's underserved communities and populations. HRSA -funded health centers are ev aluated on a set of performance measures emphasizing health outcomes and the value of care delivered. These measures provide a balanced, comprehensive look at a health center's services toward common conditions affecting underserved communities. Performanc e measures align with national standards and are commonly used by Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance/managed care organizations. Benchmarking health center outcomes to national rates demonstrates how health center performance compares to the performa nce of the nation overall. Timely entry into prenatal care is an indicator of both access to and quality of care. Identifying maternal disease and risks for complications of pregnancy or birth during the first trimester can also help improve birth outc omes. Results over the past few years demonstrate improved performance as the percentage of pregnant health center patients that began prenatal care in the first trimester grew from 57.8 percent in 2011 to 74.0 percent in 2021, meeting the program target. Additional targeted maternal health efforts, including Quality Improvement Fund investments, will continue to advance performance on this goal and improve health outcomes. Appropriate prenatal care management can also have a significant effect on the inci dence of low birth weight (LBW), the risk factor most closely associated with neonatal mortality. Monitoring birth weight rates is one way to measure quality of care and health outcomes for health center female patients of childbearing age, approximately 25 percent of the total health center patient population served in 2021. In 2021, the health center rate was 8.57 percent, and has consistently been lower than the national rate (not yet known for 2021) during the past several years, despite health center s serving a higher risk prenatal population than represented nationally in terms of socio -economic status, health status and other factors. 15 Nocon, Robert S. et al. \"Health Care Use and Spendin g for Medicaid Enrollees in Federally Qualified Health Centers Versus Other Primary Care Settings\" American Journal of Public Health, Nov 2016 79 Health center patients, including low -income individuals, racial/ethnic minority groups, and persons who are uninsu red, are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Clinical evidence indicates that access to appropriate care can improve the health status of patients with chronic diseases and thus reduce or eliminate health disparit ies. The Health Center Program began reporting data from all grantees on the control of hypertension and diabetes via its Uniform Data System in 2008. In 2021, 60 percent of adult health center patients with diagnosed hypertension had blood pressure under adequate control (less than 140/90), and 68 percent of adult health center patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes had their most recent hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) under control (less than or equal to 9 percent). Health centers improve health outcomes by emphasiz ing the care management of patients with multiple health care needs and the use of key quality improvement practices, including health information technology. HRSA's Health Center Program Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Initiative supports health cent ers to achieve national PCMH recognition , an advanced model of primary care using a team -based approach to improve quality through coordination of care and patient engagement. In FY 2021, more than three -fourths of HRSA -funded health centers were recognize d as PCMHs. In addition, health centers have advanced quality and accountability by adopting Health Information Technology (HIT) , including the use of certified Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telehealth and other technologies that advance and enable quality improvement. Over 99 percent of all health centers reported having an EHR in 2021. Promoting Efficiency: Health centers p rovide cost -effective, affordable, quality primary health care services. The Program's efficiency measure tracks the ratio of medical patients per medical physicians in health centers, which focuses on maximizing the overall efficiency and scope of clinica l provider teams, recognizing the valuable and cost -effective contributions of physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives to health center patient access to comprehensive, quality primary care services. In 2019, the number of medical patients per physician in health centers was 1,779. In 2020, the number decreased to 1,713, likely due to the impacts of COVID -19 on the total patient number in health centers; and in 2021, the number of medical patients per physician in health ce nters was 1,734. External Evaluation: In addition to internal monitoring of health center performance, peer reviewed literature and major reports continue to document that health centers successfully increase access to care, promote quality and cost -effective care, and improve patient outcomes, especially for traditionally underserved populations. Health centers that receive supplemental substance use disorder -specific HRSA grants had increased substance abuse disorder service capacity and utilization.

PMID: 31479374. Health centers with longer periods of PCMH recognition were more likely to have improved their clinical quality on 9 of 11 measures, than health centers with fewer years of PCMH recognition.

Health center Medicaid patients had lower use and spending than did non -health center patient s across all services, with 22 percent fewer visits and 33 percent lower spending on specialty care, and 25 percent fewer admissions and 27 percent lower spending on inpatient care. Total spending was 24 percent lower for health center patients. (Nocon, Robert S. et al. \"Health Care Use and Spending for Medicaid Enrollees in federally Qualified Health Centers Versus Other Primary Care Settings\" American Journal of Public Health, Nov 2016). Health centers demonstrate lower total costs for Medicare benefic iaries. Total median annual costs (at $2,370) for health center Medicare patients were lower by 10 percent compared to patients in physician offices ($2,667) and by 30 percent compared to patients in outpatient clinics ($3,580).

FY ................................ ................... Other Program Description The Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program encourages health care providers to volunteer their time at qualified free clinics by providing medical malpractice protection at sponsoring health clinics, thus expanding the capacity of the health care safety net. In many communities , free clinics assist in meeting the health care needs of the uninsured and underserved. They provide a venue for providers to volunteer their services. Most free clinics are small organizations with annual budgets of less than $250,000. In FY 2004, Con gress provided first -time funding for payments of free clinic provider's claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The appropriation established the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Judgment Fund and extended FTCA coverage to medical professional volunteers in free clinics in order to expand access to health care services for low -income individuals in medically underserved areas. Allocation Method: Qualifying free clinics submit applications to the Department of Health and Human Services to deem p roviders that they sponsor. Qualifying free clinics (or health care facilities operated by nonprofit private entities) must be licensed or certified in accordance with applicable law regarding the provision of health services. To qualify under the Free C linics Medical Malpractice Program, the clinic cannot: accept reimbursements from any third -party payor (including reimbursement under any insurance policy or health plan, or under any Federal or State health benefits program including Medicare or Medicaid ); or impose charges on the individuals to whom the services are provided; or impose charges according to the ability of the individual involved to pay the charge. FY 2022 Final --- --- --- --- 86 Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Prog ram is $1 million, which is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. In FY 2022, there was one paid claim under the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program. The Program Fund has a current balance of approximately $4 million. The request will support the Prog ram's continued achievement of its performance targets addressing its goal of maintaining access and capacity in the health care safety net. The funding request also includes costs associated with information technology and other program support costs. Targets for FY 2024 focus on maintaining FY 2023 target levels for the number of volunteer free clinic health care providers deemed eligible for FTCA malpractice coverage at 16,530, while also maintaining the number of free clinics operating with FTCA deeme d clinicians at 255. The Program will also continue to promote efficiency by restraining growth in the annual Federal administrative costs necessary to deem each provider, with a target of $75 administrative cost per provider in FY 2024. The FY 2024 Bu dget will also support the Program's continued coordination and collaboration with related Federal programs to further leverage and promote efforts to increase the capacity of the health care safety net. Areas of collaboration include coordination with th e Health Center FTCA Program, also administered by HRSA, to share program expertise. In addition, the two programs control costs by sharing a contract to process future claims, and by providing technical support and outreach. The Program will coordinate with non -profit free clinic -related umbrella groups on issues related to program information dissemination and outreach and will continue to collaborate with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS Office of General Counsel (HHS/OGC) to assist in draft ing items including deeming applications and related policies. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Fundin g History Fiscal Year FY 2021, 16,530 health care providers received Federal malpractice insurance through the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program, exceeding the Program target. In FY 2019, 236 clinics operated with FTCA deemed clinicians; in FY 2020, 230 clinics participated, and in FY 2021, 255 clinics participated, exceeding the program target in each year. Free clinics realized a significant increase in patient visits in FY 2021, with nearly 818,000 87 reported. The increase was due to the impact of COVID -19 on the demand for services at free clinics in FY 2021, which is expected to return to pre -COVID -19 levels. Promoting Efficiency: The Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program is committed to improving overall efficiency by controlling the Federal administrative costs necessary to deem each provider. By restraining these annual administrative costs, the Program is able to provide an increasing number of clinicians with malpractice coverage, thus building the free clinic workforce capacity nationwide and increasing access to care for the target populations served by these clinics.

Other (Competitive Awards to Individuals) Program Description Since its inception in 1972, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) has worked to increase access to care in underserved areas by supporting qualified health care providers dedicated to working i n underserved communities in urban, rural, and tribal areas. Across the nation, NHSC clinicians serve patients in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) - areas that meet criteria for having a greater need for primary, dental, or mental health care pro viders. Through the use of scholarships and loan repayments, the NHSC incentivizes primary care clinicians to serve in many of the 22,000 primary, dental and mental health HPSAs across the nation. The majority of these providers continue to provide service in HPSA after the service commitment has been completed. 90 Section 332(k)(1) of the Public Health Service Act directed HRSA to identify Maternity Care Target Areas (MCTAs), or geographic areas within HPSAs that have a shortage of maternity care health prof essionals and 6,383 MCTAs have been identified. In FY 2023, HRSA will begin using MCTA scores, which are generated for each Primary Care HPSA using its service area, to distribute all awards to maternity care health professionals to serve in MCTAs. Materni ty providers are defined as obstetricians and gynecologists ( OB/GYN), Family Practice with OB, and Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs). The NHSC operates seven programs to place clinicians at NHSC -approved sites in underserved communities across the nation. T hese health care delivery sites must meet certain requirements such as providing care to individuals regardless of their ability to pay through the use of a sliding fee schedule. NHSC Scholarship Program (SP): The NHSC SP provides financial support throug h scholarships that cover tuition and other reasonable education expenses, and a monthly living stipend, to health professions students committed to providing primary care in underserved communities of greatest need. The NHSC SP provides a supply of clinic ians who will be available over the next one to eight years, depending on the length of their education and training programs. Upon completion of training, NHSC Scholars become salaried employees of NHSC - approved sites in underserved communities. NHSC Scho lars will provide a one -year service commitment for each year of scholarship support received. There is a two -year minimum service commitment and awardees can receive a maximum of four years of scholarship support. NHSC Loan Repayment Program (LRP): The NHSC LRP offers fully -trained primary care clinicians the opportunity to receive assistance to pay off qualifying educational loans in exchange for service in a HPSA. For an initial two years of service, participants receive up to $50,000 in loan repayment assistance, with the option of continuing to serve for up to three additional years for $20,000 in loan repayment per year. The NHSC LRP recruits clinicians as they complete training and are immediately available for service, as well as seasoned professio nals. NHSC Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Workforce LRP: The NHSC received a dedicated appropriation to expand and improve access to quality opioid and SUD treatment in rural and underserved areas nationwide in a variety of settings including Opioid Treat ment Programs, Office -based Opioid Treatment Facilities, and Non -opioid Outpatient SUD facilities. The funding supports the recruitment and retention of health professionals needed in underserved areas to provide evidence -based SUD treatment and prevent ov erdose deaths. In exchange for three years of service at an NHSC -approved SUD treatment facility, providers receive up to $75,000 in loan repayment assistance to reduce their educational financial debt. NHSC Rural Community LRP: A portion of the appropriations provides funding for the NHSC Rural Community LRP, a program for providers working to combat the opioid epidemic in the nation's rural communities. The NHSC Rural Community LRP has made loan repayment awards in coordination with the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program initiative funded by the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) to provide evidence -based substance use treatment, assist in recovery, and to prevent overdose deaths across the nation. In exchange for 91 three years of service, providers receive up to $100,000 in loan repayment assistance to reduce their educational financial debt in exchange for service at SUD treatment facilities. NHSC and the Indian Health Service (IHS): Funding has been directed t o support awards in the aforementioned NHSC LRPs, to fully -trained medical, nursing, dental, and behavioral clinicians including SUD treatment providers, to deliver health care services in Indian Health Service facilities, Tribally -Operated 638 Health Prog rams, and urban Indian health programs (ITUs). Federal Indian Health Service Clinics, Tribal Health Clinics, urban Indian health programs, and dually -funded Tribal Health Clinics/Community Health Centers are automatically designated as HPSAs. With this dir ected funding, the NHSC has awarded all eligible clinicians serving in ITUs who have applied to the NHSC LRPs. In exchange for an initial two years of service, providers receive up to $50,000 in loan repayment assistance with the option of continuing to se rve for up to three additional years for $20,000 in loan repayment per continuing year. NHSC Students to Service (S2S) LRP: The NHSC S2S LRP provides loan repayment assistance of up to $120,000 to health professions students committed to providing primar y care in their last year of school in return for a three -year commitment to provide primary health care in rural and urban HPSAs of greatest need. State Loan Repayment Program (SLRP): The SLRP is a federal -state partnership grant program that has traditionally required a dollar -for-dollar match from the state that enters into loan repayment contracts with clinicians who practice in a HPSA in that state. The program serves as a complemen t to the NHSC and provides flexibility to states to help meet their unique primary care workforce needs. States have the discretion to focus on one, some, or all of the eligible primary care disciplines eligible within the NHSC and may also include pharmac ists and registered nurses. States receiving funding from this opportunity are encouraged to allow health professionals to practice to the full extent of their license. In FY 2022, HRSA made 50 new awards through additional flexibilities authorized by th e American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021. These flexibilities included waiving the matching funds requirement and allowing up to 10 percent of grant funds to be spent on administrative costs, which provided further incentives for states to participate in t he program. These funds support a three -year grant cycle that began in FY 2022. Eligible Entities: NHSC SP and S2S: Participants must be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a full -time student pursuing a degree in a NHSC -eligible discipline at an acc redited health professions school or program located in a State, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. territory. NHSC LRPs: Participants must be practicing in a NHSC -eligible discipline with qualified student loan debt for education that led to their degre e. NHSC SUD Workforce LRP and Rural Community LRP: Participants must be working, or have accepted a position to work, at an NHSC -approved SUD treatment facility. 92 SLRP: The 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $965.6 million is $547.7 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. The Budget proposes a thre e-year extension of mandatory funding through FY 2026 totaling $2.4 billion. The request will result in a projected field strength of 20,696 in FY 2024. This request will fund an estimated 406 new and 6 continuation scholarship awards, 10,501 new and 3,12 9 continuation loan repayment awards, and 166 Students to Service loan repayment awards. The request includes $25 million in discretionary funding specifically for behavioral health providers, including peer support specialists and providers in crisis cent ers. HRSA dedicated all ARP Act funding as of September 30, 2022. ARP Act resources enabled the NHSC to recruit the largest primary care workforce in the program's 50 -year history. The NHSC increased the number of initial two -year contracts it awarded in FY 2021 and FY 2022. As a result, the program expects that many NHSC LRP participants first awarded in FY 2021 and FY 2022 will seek one -year continuation awards in FY 2024. To preserve continuity of services in communities, the NHSC uses its resources to award current participants continuation contracts prior to awarding contracts to new participants. The significant increase in demand for continuation contracts for providers who received ARP -funded awards will reduce the remaining amount available to mak e new awards and result in a decrease in the NHSC field strength in FY 2023. The proposed level of $965.6 million will allow the NHSC to maintain its current field strength in FY 2024 by recruiting primary care, behavioral health, and dental health provi ders to areas of greatest need. The NHSC will also work to address language access barriers to care. The funding request also includes costs associated with the award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program sup port costs.

Eligible site s include facilities such as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and FQHC Look -Alikes, American Indian and Alaska Native health clinics, rural health clinics, school -based clinics, and community mental health centers. In FY 2021, the ARP Act approp riated $800 million to the NHSC, $700 million of is for the NHSC SP, LRPs, and S2S LRP; these funds enabled the NHSC to award all eligible applicants to these programs. The remainder of the $700 million was fully obligated in FY 2022. The ARP Act pro vided the remaining $100 million to the SLRP; these funds are supporting a three -year grant cycle that began in FY 2022.

Competitive Grant/Contract Program Description Since the nation's health care system is constantly changing - and preparing new providers requires long lead times - it is critical to have high quality projections to ensure a workforce of sufficient size and skills capable of meeting the nation's health care needs. Policy makers and other decision makers need high quality information about the health workforce that incorporates up-to-date research, modeling, and trends. The National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (NCHWA) collects and analyzes health workforce data an d information to provide national and state policymakers, researchers, and the public with information on health workforce supply and demand. NCHWA also evaluates the effectiveness of HRSA's workforce investments. To that end, NCHWA focuses on: Providing t imely reports and data on the current state and trends of the U.S. health workforce; Building national capacity for health workforce data collection by working with federal agencies, professional associations, and others to develop and promote guidelines for data collection and analysis; Improving tools for data management, analysis, modeling, and projection to support research, policy analysis, and decision making, as well as evaluation of the effectiveness of workforce programs and policies; Responding to information and data needs by translating data and findings to inform policies and programs; and Analyzing grantee performance data and evaluating Bureau of Health Workforce's programs. 114 Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $5.6 million is equ al to the FY 2023 Enacted Level. This request will fund continued work on health occupation projections and their visualization for the public, nine Health Workforce Research Centers (HWRCs), the development and publication of the Area Health Resources Fil es (AHRF), and the publication and analyses of the 2022 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN). In FY 2024, NCHWA will continue to model supply and demand of health professionals across a range of health occupations, years, and metro and non -metro geographies, making these assessments of the adequacy of the health workforce available through briefs a nd online tools. These data are publicly released in an interactive projection visualization tool . As in prior years, projections data on dozens of different health care oc cupations will continue to be published at the same time, including: Physicians by type Nurses including APRNs Behavioral health providers Primary care providers Women's health providers These projections will also include alternative scenarios to show h ow the projected supply and demand changes if certain key inputs change. One alternative scenario examines how demand would change for an occupation if everyone used its services at the same rate as the insured population. In FY 2024, NCHWA will continue to enhance its projection model to allow for even more sophisticated analysis and projection of health workforce supply and demand, taking into account changing national demographics, the demand for health care services, and the impact those changes have o n the delivery of health care. In FY 2024, NCHWA will continue to oversee nine HWRCs that conduct and disseminate research and data analysis on health workforce issues of national importance, and provide technical assistance to regional and local entities on workforce data collection, analysis, and reporting.30 Together, these nine Centers examine a broad range of issues related to various sectors of the health care workforce, including (but not limited to) occupations in oral health, long term services an d supports, allied health, behavioral health, emerging health workforce issues, public health, and health equity in health workforce education and training. Research conducted by these HWRCs aims to strengthen the evidence base for effective education and training programs that can enable and empower a health workforce capable of fostering and ensuring health equity for all populations. Examples of research include: 30 In FY 2024 , one Health Workforce Research Center (HWRC) administered by NCHWA will be funded from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , one HWRC will be partially funded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and several HWRCs will be partially funded from the Bureau of Primary Health Care. 115 Looking across a range of health care professions and providers to develop a comprehensive picture of how current health workforce education and training programs incorporate consideration of health equity, including social needs, social determinants of health, and related elements, into their programs. Developing a deeper understanding of the current behavioral health workforce and its readiness related to addressing the current opioid and overdose crisis. Investigating the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on sectors of the U.S. health workforce, such as long -term services and support occupation s. Evaluating health workforce education and training programs to understand their impact on increasing access to primary care; mitigating provider shortages in underserved areas; delivering integrated primary, behavioral, and oral health care; addressing health workforce diversity; and strengthening community/provider partnerships. In FY 2024, NCHWA will continue to maintain the Area Health Resource Files (AHRF) dataset on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services. The AHRF is updated annually and contains detailed information on health professions, health facilities, and population demographics from a variety of sources. NCHWA will also continue to maintain the AHRF dashboard , which is an interactive dashboard that allows members of the public to easily access information about topics such as the diversity of the health care workforce. In FY 2024, NCHWA will publish updated results of the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN), which will be also be available in visualized formats in the recently released NCHWA Nursing Workforce Dashboard . The updated NSSRN, which is being collected in FY 2023 in partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau and represents the nation's largest sample survey of registered nurses and nurse practitioners, will p rovide an unprecedented look at the state of the registered nurse workforce - particularly how the workforce was impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up perfo rmance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount In 2022, NCHWA released updated projections for the years 2020 -2035 for over 100 occupations in a publicly accessible an interactive projection visualization tool . In addition to the release in a customizable tool, NCHWA also issued a series of briefs that were aimed at interpreting the data in a more accessible format on key trends in the workforce for policymakers 116 and the general public. These included five projections briefs on behavioral health, l ong-term services and support, nursing, physicians, and primary care. NCHWA also developed and disseminated a brief on the State of the Maternal Health Workforce . In FY 2022, NCHWA also improved the projections methodology and expanded the number of occupations with projections. The methodology was enhanced to capture the effects of the pandemic on the supply and demand pr ojections and incorporate the most current sources of data. These enhancements allow for even more sophisticated analysis and projection of health workforce supply and demand, taking into account changing national demographics, the demand for health care s ervices, and the impact those changes have on the delivery of health care. The documentation for the methodology was also converted from PDF to HTML, which makes it more accessible to those using assistive technology. NCHWA increased the number of occupati ons with projections from 46 to over 100. These improvements made during FY 2022 were incorporated in projections released in FY 2023. In FY 2022, NCHWA recompeted the Health Workforce Research Center Cooperative Agreement Program. This program funds nine academic research centers that support and disseminate rigorous and state -of-the-art applied research that strengthens evidence -based policy and enhances the Federal Government's and the public's understanding of issues and trends in the health workforce . Theses nine centers are distributed all over the country and focus on key facets of workforce policy including (but not limited to): health equity, allied health, long -term care, emerging issues, behavioral health, public health, and technical assistance to support workforce planning and development. In FY 2022, NCHWA deployed a new diversity module of the AHRF dashboard , which is one of the most comprehensive, publicly available sources of county, state, and national data on health care demographics. This allows users to access detailed data on the race/ethnicity, age, and sex of providers via an intuitive interface. In FY 2023, NCHWA created and publicly released a visualization tool, t he NCHWA Nursing Workforce Dashboard . This tool visualizes data covering over 100,000 unique data points from the most recently available NSSRN and allows the public to view data on the nursing workforce landscape, including demographics, employment, and education of the nursing workforce. Additionally, in FY 2022, NCHWA also finalized the questionnaire for the 2022 NSSRN and is partnering with the U.S. Census Bureau to begin data collection in FY 2023. The forthcoming data will provide an unprecedented look at the state of the registered nurse workforce - particularly how the workforce was impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Finally, in an effort to better unde rstand and demonstrate the outcomes of BHW programs, NCHWA develops and publicly releases Program Accomplishment and Outcomes reports for grant programs overseen by the Bur eau of Health Workforce. Between FY 2020 and FY 2022, NCHWA released fifteen, retrospective evaluation reports as well as annual program accomplishment reports for graduate medical education programs. These reports highlight the ways in which BHW programs impact access, supply, distribution, and quality of the health workforce. 117 Grants Awards Table FY 2022 Final FY 2023 Enacted FY 2024 President's Budget Awards 9 9 9 Average Award $500,000 $500,000 $500,000 Range of $900,000 $447,164 - $900,000 118 Primary Care Training and Enhancement Program Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Section 747, as amended by CARES Act, Section 3401, Public Law 116 -136 and Public Grant/Cooperative Program Description The Primary Care Training and Enhancement (PCTE) Program aims to strengthen the primary care workforce by supporting training for future primary care clinicians and faculty and promoting primary care practice, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

GACA: Accredited health professions sch ools of allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, nursing, social work, psychology, dentistry, pharmacy, or allied health who apply on behalf of individuals where the individuals have a full -time junior faculty appointment. FY 2022 $47,245,000 --- FTE 5 5 5 --- 137 Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $47.2 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted Level. The request will fund approximately 43 new GWEP awards and 26 GACA non -competing continuation awards to improve outcomes for older adults by integrating geriatrics and primary care delivery sites/systems, and by supporting the career development of junior faculty in geriatrics. The Programs provide training focusing on interprofessional and team -based care across the educational continuum (students, faculty, providers, direct servic e workers, patients, families, and lay and family caregivers). The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount In Academic Year (AY) 2021 -2022, the most recent year for which performance data is available, GWEP trained over one million health care professionals, students, patients, and caregivers through 7,160 courses that awardees developed or enhanced with GWEP f unding. GWEP's geriatrics -related training included 1,889 continuing education courses, which reached 501,431 individuals and provided 4,825 hours of training. A total of 673 continuing education courses (36 percent) focused on Alzheimer's Disease and rela ted dementias. This subset of courses trained 130,012 health care professionals, students, patients, and caregivers. GWEP's trainees included 71,870 health professions students who received geriatric -focused training in settings across the care continuum. Forty -five percent of these trainees were underrepresented minorities and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds. By the end of the academic year, 64,152 students completed a GWEP program. In FY 2021 GWEP received an additional $2 million in annual appropriat ions for which HRSA awarded 12 grant recipients through a limited competition for current grant recipients. The purpose of the funding was to provide COVID -19 specific education and training to the nursing home workforce in order to improve care to nursing home residents. As a result of the additional funding, the 12 grant recipients partnered with 12 other GWEP recipients on the COVID -19 project. These GWEP COVID -19 grant recipients educated and trained the nursing home primary care workforce (which consis ts of primary care workforce includes patients, families, caregivers, direct care workers, and health professions students, residents, fellows, faculty, and providers who live or work in nursing homes). This training took place within the context of the age-friendly health systems framework and addressed best practices regarding the management 138 and treatment of medically frail older persons who are at risk of contracting COVID -19, are currently ill with COVID -19, or families of persons with COVID -19 who have died. In FY 2022, HRSA received an additional $2 million in annual appropriations with which HRSA provided a second year of supplemental funding to the 12 COVID -19 grant recipients. In FY 2022, funding was awarded to each GWEP grantee to develop or enhan ce nursing curricula on nursing home care using an age -friendly health systems framework. Each GWEP grantee will partner with at least one School of Nursing, one accredited Certified Nurse Assistance program and at least one nursing home to accomplish the goals of this supplemental funding. In addition, in FY 2022, HRSA funded 48 non -competing continuation awards. A total of 1,124 nursing homes receiving education and training by all 48 GWEP grantees in FY 2022. In FY 2023, HRSA will support 48 non -competin g continuation awards for the GWEP Program, through which the GWEP grantees will continue to address their goals and objectives. GACA: In Academic Year (AY) 2021 -2022, the GACA Program directly supported 24 faculty, including 14 physicians specializing in geriatrics or geriatric psychiatry and two nurse practitioners specializing in gerontology. GACA -supported faculty gave 94 conference presentations, received 35 research or education grants, and published 32 articles in peer - reviewed journals. GACA fellows also delivered 14,142 hours of education through 325 unique training programs and workshops. These courses reached 14,458 faculty, he alth professionals, and students specializing in medicine (35 percent), public health (15 percent), nursing (14 percent), behavioral health (12 percent), and other disciplines (24 percent). In FY 2022, there were 24 grant recipients. However, three grant recipients relinquished their GACA awards due to being promoted. The GACA Program is for instructors and assistant professors only. GACA candidates that are promoted within the grant's period of performance are required to relinquish their grant. Therefor e, HRSA funded 21 non -competing continuation awards. In FY 2023, HRSA is planning a new competition to fund 26 grant recipients.

The Behavioral Health Workforce Development (BHWD) Programs expand the number of behavioral health professionals and paraprofessionals, improve the quality of care by recruiting a dive rse behavioral health workforce and training them to work collaboratively on interprofessional teams , and promote the integration of behavioral health into primary care settings to further increase access to behavioral health services. The United States is currently facing a shortage of behavioral health providers. HRSA's 2022 Behavioral Health Workforce Projections Report estimated national level health workforce needs for several behavioral health occupations between 2020 and 2035.37 The report estimate d the demand for addiction counselors, for example, is expected to increase 10 percent by 2035, with demand exceeding supply and leading to a deficit of addiction counselors of approximately 920 Full-Time Equivalents. Also, the report estimated that by 203 5, the supply of psychiatrists is expected to decrease by approximately 8 percent. The COVID -19 pandemic has exacerbated the existing imbalance in supply of and demand for behavioral health providers across the U.S. There were over 104,000 drug overdose d eaths in the United States during the 12 -month period ending in September 2021. Such deaths have increased approximately ten -fold since 1980. 36 FTE totals include FTE from Supplemental Funding. 37 Health Resources and Services Administration 2022. \"Behavioral Health --- 142 Opioids, particularly fentanyl, are the chief drug involved in these deaths, though non -opioid drugs also contribu te.

By the end of the academic year, the ANEW program produced 1,468 graduates ready to enter the nursing workforce. This exceeded the FY 2021 target of 1,000 graduates because gr antees outperformed expectations. The Advanced Nursing Education Program also provided specialized training to meet national needs, including: Training 2,930 nurses as sexual assault nurse examiners, including 39 percent who were from rural areas; Suppo rting 1,457 nurse anesthetist students to become Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) who are well prepared and well positioned to practice independently and collaboratively within interprofessional teams delivering evidence - based, high quality, safe anesthesia care, and acute and chronic pain management services; and Supporting 487 nurse practitioners in new and expanded nurse practitioner residency programs to prepare new providers to practice independently, with a focus on the integration of behavioral health and/or maternal health into primary care. The targets for the number of students trained in advanced nursing degree programs and the number of graduates from advanced nursing degree programs were reduced because COVID affected attrition rates in nursing programs. The number of trainees and graduates has not returned to anticipated levels, so FY 2024 targets were adjusted based on FY 2021 results and trend data. 155 Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 Target FY 2024 Target FY 2024 Target +/-FY 2023 Target 2140.01 Number of students trained in advanced nursing degree programs (Output) FY 2021: 3,964 Target: 3,700 (Target Exceeded) 4,800 3,800 - 1,000 2140.02 Percentage of advanced nursing degree students who are underrepresented minorities and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds (Outcome) FY 2021: advanced nursing degree programs (Outcome) FY 2021: 1,468 Target: 1,000 (Target Exceeded) 2,000 1,200 - 800 156 ANE Program Outputs Year and Most Recent Result FY 2022 Target FY 2023 Target FY 2024 Target Number of new nurse anesthetists produced through the Nurse Anesthetist Training Program FY 2021: 1,350 1,200 1,200 1,250 Percentage of nurse anesthetists working in medically underserved communities and/or rural areas one year after completing the Nurse Anesthetist Training Program FY 2021: 50% 50% 50% 50% Number of new sexual assault nurse examiners produced through the Advanced Nursing Education -Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners Program FY 2021: 580 300 850 900 Percentage of sexual assault nurse examiners working in medically underserved communities and/or rural areas one year after completing the Advanced Nursing Education -Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners Program FY 2021: 29% 40% 40% fellowship program completers FY 2021: 245 150 160 170 Percentage of new nurse practitioners working in medically underserved communities and/or rural areas after completing a HRSA -funded nurse practitioner residency or fellowship program FY 2024 President's 211 212 229 Average Award $439,788 $553,785 $537,135 Range of $3,785 - $1,000,000 157 Nursing Workforce Diversity Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Sections 821, as amended by CARES Act, Section 3404, by Public Law 116-136. Program Description The Nursing Workforce Diversity (NWD) Program increases nursing education opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, includ ing racial and ethnic minorities who are underrepresented among registered nurses. The overarching goal of the NWD Program is to increase access to high quality, culturally aligned registered nurse providers that reflect the diversity of the communities in which they serve. This goal is accomplished by assisting students from disadvantaged backgrounds to become registered nurses through student stipends, scholarships, pre -entry preparation and retention activities; facilitating diploma or associate degree r egistered nurses to become baccalaureate -prepared registered nurses; and preparing practicing registered nurses for advanced nursing education. Eligible Entities: Accredited schools of nursing, nursing centers, academic health centers, state or local gov ernments, and other private or public entities, including tribes and tribal organizations. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $24.3 million is the same as the FY 2023 Enacted Level. This request will fund 42 continuation awards to increase nursing education opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds . The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. FY 2022 Final $24,343,000 --- FTE 4 4 4 --- 158 Funding History Fiscal Year supported 32 NWD non -competing continuation awards and nine new awards. In FY 2023, HRSA will continue to support 41 non -competing continuation NWD awards and one new award. In Academic Year (AY) 2021 -2022, the most recent year for which performance data is available, the NWD Program trained 10,981 students. Sixty -seven percent of the NWD trainees were from disadvantaged backgrounds and 56 percent were underrepresented minorities. NWD trainees included 7,809 nursing students enrolled in de gree programs and other 3,172 NWD trainees academic support programs. A total of 3,848 students completed their NWD programs. The NWD Program provided scholarships and stipends to a subset of 1,210 nursing students. One hundred percent of these nursing s tudents were underrepresented minorities and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds. By the end of the academic year, 626 of these nursing students graduated from their degree programs. Of the 242 prior year graduates with one -year follow -up data, 54 percent cu rrently work in or pursuing further training in medically underserved communities. In AY 2021 -2022, the NWD -Eldercare Enhancement Program trained 1,471 students. NWD - Eldercare Enhancement trainees included 1,055 nursing students enrolled in college -level degree programs and 416 students participating in academic support programs. By the end of the academic year, 576 students graduated or completed their NWD -Eldercare Enhancement programs. 159 Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 Target FY 2024 Target FY 2024 +/- FY 2023 2150.01 Percentage of Nursing Workforce Diversity participants who are underrepresented minorities and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds (Outcome) FY 2021: Number of Nursing Workforce Diversity participants who participated in academic support programs during the academic year (Outcome) FY 2021: 3,172 Target: 4,500 (Target Not Met) 4,500 3,000 -1,500 2150.03 Number of Nursing Workforce Diversity participants who are enrolled in a nursing degree program (Outcome) FY 2021: 7,809 Target: 2,500 (Target Exceeded) 6,000 6,250 +250 160 NWD Program Outputs Year and Most Recent Result FY 2022 Target FY 2023 Target FY 2024 Target Percentage students from underrepresented minority backgrounds FY 2021: 56% 60% 50% 50% Number of nursing nursing programs FY 2021: 2,216 2,500 3,570 3,570 Performance Narrative Most recent results are for activities in Academic Year (AY) 2021 -2022 funded in FY 2021.

Grants Awards Table FY 2022 Final FY 2023 Enacted FY 2024 President's Budget Awards 41 42 42 Average Award $524,395 $463,961 Range of $376, 951 - $555,000 161 Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention Programs Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Sections 831 and 831A, as amended by CARES Act, Section Grant/Cooperative Agreement Program Description The Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention (NEPQR) Programs address national nursing needs and strengthen nursing workforce capacity in three priority areas: education, practice, and retention. The Programs support academic, service and continuing education projects to enhance nursing education, improve the quality of patient care, increase nurse retention, and strengthen the nursing workforce. The NEPQR Programs have several statutory purposes that support the development, distribution and retention of a diverse, culturally c ompetent nursing workforce that can adapt to the population's changing health care needs and provide the highest quality of care for all. The Programs aim to increase the number of nursing students exposed to meaningful clinical experiences and training in medically underserved and rural communities, who will then be more likely to choose to work in these settings upon graduation. Eligible Entities: Accredited schools of nursing, health care facilities, and partnerships of a nursing school and health care facility. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $91.9 million is $32.5 million above the FY 2023 Enacted Level, to expand, enhance, and modernize nursing education programs by increasing the number of faculty and students at schools of nursing. To address this critical challenge, HRSA will provide funding to schools of nursing to increase the number of faculty with an emphasis on recruiting faculty who are underrepresented in the nursing workforce. The NEPQR Programs will also target the expansion of grant -supported programs in states with the greatest shortages of nurses. The proposed expansion will lead to an increased number of faculty and entry -level nurses by funding 32 new workforce expansion grants. FY 2022 Final FTE 5 5 7 --- 162 Limited clinical nursing faculty is one o f the most significant barriers impeding expansion of the nursing workforce. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, in 2020, 80,521 qualified applications were not accepted at schools of nursing due primarily to a shortage of clinica l sites, faculty, and resource constraints. The number of students enrolled in schools of nursing is highly dependent on the number of faculty available to teach them. Faculty shortages at nursing schools across the country are limiting student capacity at a time when the need for professional registered nurses continues to grow. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount (AY) 2021 -2022, NEPQR Programs trained 7,560 nurses and nursing students, including 1,520 nurses and nursing students trained to provide care in medically underserved areas through NEPQR Programs. In addition, 4,230 trainees and professionals participated in interprofessional c are teams through NEPQR Programs. This includes training in key areas to: Recruit and train nursing students and current registered nurses (RNs) to practice to the full scope of their license in community based primary care teams; Increase the training of the current and future nursing workforce and strengthen their ability to provide integrated behavioral health care; and Strengthen nurses' capacity to address the complex health care needs of those living in rural and medically underserved areas through the use of simulation -based technology. NEPQR's output measures reflected below were new in FY 2023, so FY 2021 is the second -year data has been reported for this measure; therefore, FY 2021 results must be weighted heavily when setting new target s until a clear trend has been established. The FY 2023 target has been maintained for FY 2024 for Measure 2160.01 because the increase from the FY 2021 actual to the FY 2023 target aligns with the projected budget increase of approximately 55 percent. The FY 2024 target for Measure 2060.02 was increased to approximately 55 percent more than the FY 2021 actual to reflect the projected budget increase. 163 Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 Target FY 2024 Target FY 2024 Target +/-FY 2023 Target 2160.01 Number of nurses and nursing students trained to provide care in medically underserved areas through Nurse Education, Practice, Quality, and Retention Programs (Output) FY 2021: 1,520 Target: Not Defined (Historical Actual) 2,400 2,400 Maintain 2160.02 Number of Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention Programs trainees and professionals contributing to interprofessional care teams at clinical training sites (Output) FY 2021: 4,230 Target: Not Defined (Historical Actual) 5,500 6,500 + 1,000 NEPQR Grants Awards Table FY 2022 Final FY 2023 Enacted FY 2024 President's Budget Awards 66 57 89 Average Award $610,791 $708,777 $821,757 Range of 2023 Enacted FY 2024 President's Budget Awards 11 22 22 Average Award $404,460 $500,000 $500,000 Range of Awards $480,391 - $500,000 $500,000 $500,000 165 Nurse Faculty Loan Program Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Section 846A, as amended by CARES Act, Section 3404, Public -136. ..... Grant Program Description The Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP) seeks to increase the number of qualified nursing faculty nationwide by providing low interest loans for individuals studying to be nurse faculty and loan cancelation for those who then go on to work as faculty. A robu st, geographically dispersed nurse faculty workforce is essential to producing the nursing workforce needed to meet the nation's health care needs. Successful applicants establish and operate a student loan program, including maintaining a fund, providing loans to students enrolled in advanced education nursing degree programs, and monitoring compliance with program requirements. In exchange for completion of up to four years of post -graduation full -time nurse faculty employment in an accredited school of nursing, graduates receive cancellation of up to 85 percent of the original student loan amount (plus interest thereon) as authorized by the program. The NFLP also encourages Advance Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) to serve as full -time preceptors within an academic -practice partnership framework in an effort to expand clinica l training opportunities for nursing students. The number of schools receiving a new NFLP award does not equate to the number of schools providing NFLP loans to graduate -level nursing students. New NFLP awards are made to eligible new applicants (with no current NFLP award) and continuing applicants (with a current NFLP award), who apply for the funding annually. In order to receive a new NFLP award, continuing applicants must meet certain criteria with regard to program compliance and loan fund balances. NFLP grantees are expected to continue conducting training activity and maintaining the loan fund account throughout the duration of the project. Currently, the NFLP has a total 208 awardees maintaining the loan fund account. Schools that do not receive a new award may continue making loans from the student loan fund accounts they have already established. FY 2022 Final FTE 4 4 4 --- 166 Eligible Entity: Accredited schools of nursing that offer advanced nursing education degree program(s) that prepare graduate students for roles as nur se educators. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $28.5 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted Level for the NFLP. In FY 2024, the NFLP will provide funding to accredited schools of nursing to establish and operate a student loan fund and provi de loans to students enrolled in advanced education nursing degree programs who are committed to becoming nurse faculty. The FY 2024 funding will be used to support 80 new awards to new and continuing NFLP applicants. The funding request also includes co sts associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount NFLP supported 80 awards. In FY 2023, HRSA plans to make 80 new awards to new and continuing NFLP applicants. In Academic Year (AY) 2021 -2022, NFLP awardees provided loan repayment to 2,806 nursing students. Twenty -six percent of NFLP stu dents were underrepresented minorities and 24 percent came from disadvantaged backgrounds. By the end of the academic year, 837 nursing students graduated from their degree programs. Seventy -four percent of NFLP graduates earned doctoral degrees and 26 per cent received master's degrees. Of the 571 prior year graduates with one -year follow -up data, 65 percent currently teach in full -time faculty appointments. BHW conducted a five -year outcome evaluation for the NFLP using data from AY 2015 -2020.39 During th is time frame, 74 percent of the 3,494 NFLP graduates earned doctoral degrees and 26 percent earned master's degrees. Of the 2,541 NFLP AY 2015 -2020 graduates with one -year follow -up data, 80 percent had obtained nurse faculty positions, and 91 percent of these graduates were working full -time as nurse faculty. The number of full -time nurse faculty positions in the United States increased by 3,008 positions between AY 2016 -2017 and AY 2020 -2021.40 During that same period, 1,839 NFLP graduates reported full -time nurse faculty 39 Health Resources and Service Administration.

Other (Competitive Awards to Individuals) Program Description The Nurse Corps Program addresses: (1) the distribution of nurses by supporting nurses and nursing students committed to working in communities with inadequate access to care; (2) access to behavio ral health services through set -asides in scholarships and loan repayment assistance for Nurse Practitioners (NPs) specializing in psychiatric mental health; and (3) access to women's and maternal health services through set -asides in scholarships and loan repayment assistance to scholars pursuing degrees and clinicians serving in this specialty area. In exchange for scholarship support or educational loan repayment, Nurse Corps members fulfill their service obligation by working in Critical Shortage Facil ities (CSFs) located in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) and underserved communities throughout the nation, which include rural communities and other identified geographic areas, populations, or facilities that lack access to primary care, dental health, or behavioral health services. As of September 30, 2022, over three -quarters of the Nurse Corps providers were serving in community -based settings and 21 percent were serving in rural communities. Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program (LRP): The Nurse Corps LRP assists in the recruitment and retention of professional RNs, including advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), (i.e., nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, clinical nurse specialists) who are dedicated to working in CSFs or as faculty in eligible schools of nursing. The Nurse Corps LRP decreases the economic barriers associated with pursuing careers in CSFs or in academic nursing by repaying 60 percent of the principal and interest on n ursing education loans in exchange for two years of full -time service at a CSF or in academic nursing. For an optional third year of service (via a Continuation Contract), the Nurse Corps LRP will award participants an additional 25 percent of their origin al total qualifying educational loan balance as of the effective date of their initial two -year contract. FY 2022 Final $92,635,000 --- FTE 35 39 39 --- 169 Nurse Corps Scholarship Program (SP) : The Nurse Corps SP provides scholarships to individuals who are enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an accre dited school of nursing in exchange for a service commitment of at least two years in a CSF after graduation. Nurse Corps SP awards reduce the financial barrier to nursing education for all levels of professional nursing students and increase the pipeline of nurses who will serve in CSFs. Eligible Entities Nurse Corps LRP: Participants must have a current license to practice as an RN and be employed full -time at a public or private CSF (at least 32 hours per week) or at an accredited public or private sc hool of nursing (full -time as defined by employer for at least nine months per service year). Nurse Corps SP: Participants must be enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an accredited diploma, associate, or collegiate (bachelors, master's, doctoral) schoo l of nursing program. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $92.6 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted Level. This request will fund an estimated 264 scholarship (new and continuation), and 1,207 loan repayment (new and continuation) awards. Additionally, the funds will help increas e the number of well -trained nurses available to provide mental/behavioral health and women's/maternal health services in communities experiencing a shortage in nurses. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award p rocess, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Supplemental Amount FY Budget $92,635,000 --- Program Accomplishments The Nurse Corps performance measures gauge the program's contribution towards improving access to health care and improving the health care systems through the recruitment and retention of nurses working in CSFs. In FY 2022, 51 percent of Nurse Corps LRP participants extended their service commitment for an additional year; and in FY 2022, 90 percent of Nurse Corps participants were retained in servic e at a CSF for up to two years beyond the completion of their Nurse Corps service commitment. In addition, in FY 2022, 88 percent of Nurse Corps SP awardees pursued their baccalaureate degree or advanced practice degree. 170 In FY 2021, the American Rescue Pl an (ARP) Act provided the Nurse Corps Program with $200 million in additional funding to support the nation's COVID -19 emergency response. In FY 2022, these funds allowed HRSA to bolster the nursing workforce with a total of 1,839 awards to nurses serving in CSFs, 232 awards to nurse faculty at accredited schools of nursing, and 567 awards to scholars pursuing a nursing education. In addition, Nurse Corps funded 48 Career Pathway scholarship awards to entry -level health professionals obtaining qualifying de grees to become RNs. HRSA will continue to support Career Pathway awards in FY 2023 and FY 2024, which is a set aside to create a pathway for entry -level health professionals seeking degrees to obtain a registered nursing degree. This set -aside promotes the Nurse Corps SP's effort at improving care by to extending the pipeline of nurses to address workforce shortages. In FY 2023, with remaining ARP Act funds, the Nurse Corps Program anticipates making 1,081 total awards to clinicians serving in facilities with a shortage of nurses and nurse faculty, and 313 awards to scholars pursuing a nursing education. Approximately $845,000 of ARP Act funds support nurse faculty members who are training the next generation of nurses, including priority areas of behavio ral health, women's health, and community health. The additional awards made with ARP Act funds will increase the number of continuation awards anticipated to be made in FY 2023 and FY 2024. Furthermore, as the Administration seeks to continue to address the opioid epidemic and other substance use disorders across the nation, the Nurse Corps Program supports the behavioral health nursing workforce. In FY 2023 and FY 2024, HRSA plans to continue directing up to 20 percent of scholarship and loan repayment a wards to NPs specializing in psychiatric -mental health with the goal of leveraging HRSA funding to address the opioid crisis and the recent impacts COVID -19 has had on the nation's mental health. Additionally, in support of the White House's Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis, the Nurse Corps Program will continue to support increasing the skilled workforce of women's health nurses who are trained to provide care for women, and practice in rural and underserved communities. In FY 2023 and FY 2024, HRSA plans to continue funding for women's and maternal health services up to $5 million each for scholarship and loan repayment awards for the funding of women's health NPs, certified nurse midwifery, and certified obstetrics and gynecology RNs. 171 Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result /Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 FY 2024 Target FY 2024 +/- FY 2023 2180.01: Proportion of Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program participants who extend their service contracts to commit to work at a critical shortage facility for an additional year.

FY 2024 Authorization... Expired: Method ................................ ..................... Formula -Based Payment Program Description The Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Payment Program was first established in 1999 and supports graduate medical education in freestanding children's teaching hospitals. The CHGME Payment Program helps eligible hospitals maintain GME programs to support graduate training for physicians to provide quality care to children. It supports the training of residents to care for the pediatric population and enhances the supply of primary care and pediatric medical and surgical subspecialties. A sufficient and appropriate health workforce, efficient organization of health care te ams, and training in value -based models of care are all critical components to supporting new models of care that drive value and quality throughout the entire system. Assessment conducted annually to verify the number of FTE resident counts reported by el igible awardees. Eligible Entities : Freestanding children's teaching hospitals. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $385 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted Level. This request will fund 59 awards to current eligible children's hospitals . The Budget Request will enable HRSA to continue to support approximately 8,000 physician FTEs for direct and indirect medical expenses for graduate medical education and implementing the Quality Bonus System (QBS). Direct medical education spend ing includes expenditures related to stipends and fringe benefits for residents, salaries and fringe benefits of supervising faculty, costs associated with providing the GME training programs, and institutional overhead costs. Indirect medical education sp ending includes expenditures associated with the productivity of the hospital staff as they assist in training residents, and the processing of additional diagnostic tests that residents may order during their clinical experience. FY 2022 Final 16 16 --- 175 The FY 2024 Budget Reque st will support the FTE resident verification through an annual FTE assessment contract to ensure funded FTEs counts are reported correctly and are not funded by other federal programs to avoid an overlap in payments. The funding will also support costs associated with the award process, program performance reviews, QBS eligibility reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. The funding will further support additional information technology enhancements that ensure accurate certif ication of FTE counts, review of application data, and analysis of QBS data needed to determine payments. Funding History Fiscal Year the CHGME Payment Program awarded more than $356 million to 59 eligible awardees including a QBS payment for those who meet the QBS eligibility criteria. The QBS, allows the Secretary o f HHS to distribute bonus payments to participating CHGME hospitals. In order to qualify for the QBS payment, awardees were required to complete individual -level documentation for all residents supported by the CHGME Payment Program in the FY 2022 Annual P erformance Report (AY 2021 -2022). In FY 2023, the CHGME Payment Program plans to award to the current eligible awardees and will continue to implement the QBS . During Academic Year (AY) 2021 -2022, the most recent year for which performance data is available, 59 children's hospitals received CHGME funding. Ninety percent of CHGME hospitals had FTE residents counts and caps. Furthermore, 100 percent of CHGME payments were made on time. The CHGME hospitals trained 8,224 resident FTEs:47 41 percent wer e pediatric residents, 30 percent were pediatric subspecialty residents, and 30 percent were residents training in other primary disciplines, such as family medicine. CHGME -funded hospitals served as sponsoring institutions for 43 residency programs and 265 fellowship programs, and they served as major participating rotation sites for 659 other residency and fellowship programs. The CHGME program supported the training of 6,124 pediatric residents, which included general pediatrics residents and residents from eight types of combined pediatrics programs (e.g., internal medicine/ pediatrics). CHGME also supported the training of 3,201 pediatric medical subspecialty residents, 317 pediatric surgical subspecialty residents, and 516 adult and pediatric dentist ry residents. In addition, CHGME funding was responsible for the training of 5,357 adult medical and surgical specialty residents, such as family medicine 47 Each of the children's hospitals report the number of full -time equivalent residents trained during the latest filed (completed) Medicare Cost Report period. 176 residents, who rotate through children's hospitals for pediatrics training. In total, the CHGME progr am funded 15,515 residents and fellows during AY 2021 -2022; 4,880 residents and fellows completed their programs. Over the course of the academic year, CHGME residents provided care through nearly 1.5 million patient encounters in primary care settings and over 5.1 million patient contact hours in medically underserved communities. Of the full -time residents and fellows who completed their training during AY 2021 -2022, 60 percent of these CHGME -funded physicians chose to remain and practice in the state wh ere they completed their residency training. Among the 336 health care delivery sites utilized for residency training, 45 percent provided telehealth services, 40 percent integrated behavioral health into primary care settings, and 24 percent offered subst ance use treatment services. Residents received training on topics such as opioid use treatment (23 percent), telehealth (23 percent), integrating behavioral health into primary care settings (22 percent), and health equity (22 percent).

FY 2024 Authorization ................................ ................................ Method ................................ ................................ ..................... Formula -Based Payment Program Description: The Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) Program, established in 2010, increases the number of primary care physician and dental residents trained in community - based settings where most pe ople receive their health care. Unlike most federal funding for graduate medical education (GME) which goes to hospitals, THCGME payments are made to community -based ambulatory care sites that provide primary care training. Program funds support the educational costs incurred by new and expanded residency programs. Along with supporting the salaries and benefits of residents and faculty, THCGME funds are also used to foster innovation and support curriculum enhancements aimed at improving the quality of patient care, such as the Patient -Centered Medical Home model, Electronic Health Record utilization, population health, telemedicine, and health care leadership. These activities ensure residents receive high quality training a nd are well -prepared to practice in community - based outpatient care settings after graduation. There are many benefits to training physicians and dental residents in community -based settings. In a national census of third -year family medicine residents, t hose who trained in THCs were more likely to plan to work in safety net clinics than residents who did not train in these centers.48 Evidence demonstrates that physicians who trained in cost -efficient geographic areas 48 Bazemore A, Wingrove P, Petterson S, Peterson L, Raffoul M, Phillips RL Jr. Graduates of Teachi ng Health Centers Are More Likely to Enter Practice in the Primary Care Safety Net.

Budget Re quest The FY 2024 Budget Request of $157 million is $37.7 million above the FY 2023 Enacted Level. This request will fund up to 1,469 resident full -time equivalents (FTEs) slots in Academic Year (AY) July 1, 2024 - June 30, 2025 to coincide with national residency training dates . At the start of FY 2024 the number of resident FTEs supported through this program will be 1,105. This allows the program to grow to 1,469 FTEs by the beginning of FY 2025. This cohort of resident FTEs w ill be comprised of current THCGME -supported resident FTEs and new FTEs as a result of the Teaching Health Center Planning and Development (THCPD) Program. As the THCPD supported residency programs achieve accreditation, they are able to support new FTE re sidents through THCGME Program funds. The Budget also proposes to extend mandatory funding through FY 2026 for a total investment of $841 .0 million over three years. This request would provide resources to support a total of 2,094 resident FTEs in existin g, expanded, and new THCGME residency programs at current per-resident payment levels. Continued mandatory THCGME base funding will provide THCs with the confidence to launch full recruitment efforts to fill and expand their available resident slots. The B udget also proposes to remove the cap on total THCGME payments to enable the re - obligation of unobligated balances and funds recouped through statutorily required annual reconciliation process. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program costs.

Academic Medicine. 2018; 93(1): 98 -103. 180 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Program Accomplishments In FY 2022, HRSA funded 46 planning and development awards with resources from the ARP Act under the Teaching Health Center Planning and Development Program (PHS Act Sec. 749A) to support the start -up of new community -based primary care residency programs. In FY 2023, HRSA plans to fund an additional 45 grants to support the start -up of new primary care, community -based residency programs beginning in April 2023 using remaining ARP Act resources. In AY 2021 -2022, the most recent year for which performance data is available, HRSA provided awards to 59 THCs that supported 792 resident FTE slots. These resident FTE slots provided funding to 932 individual primary care medical and dental residents, as an FTE slot may provide partial funding to more than one pe rson. By the end of the academic year, 296 physicians and dentists completed their THCGME residency programs. During their training, THCGME residents provided more than 1.1 million hours of patient care to more than 800,000 patients in medically underser ved and/or rural communities. Most THCGME residents also received training on opioid use disorder treatment, telehealth, and integrating behavioral health into primary care. Of the 251 graduates who completed their THCGME residencies in AY 2021 -2022 and reported employment data, 58 percent were already working in primary care settings, and 45 percent were already working in medically underserved and/or rural communities, including Federally Qualified Health Centers or Look -alikes, Critical Access Hospital s, Rural Health Clinics, and Indian Health Service/Tribal/Urban Indian Health Centers. The number of residents does not equal the number of graduates as primary care residency programs require one year (Dental and Geriatrics), three years (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics), or four years (Ob - Gyn and Psychiatry) of training. The THCGME Program exceeded the target for Measure 2200.02 by 16 percentage points due to additional emphasis on training in rural and/or medically underserved areas. Measure 2200.01 captures the number of FTE resident slots awarded and not the maximum possible nor the number of individuals receiving direct financial support through the program. 51 FY 2022 reflects the post -sequestration amount. 52 FY 2023 reflects the post -sequestration amount. 181 Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target f or Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 Target FY Target 2200.01 Number of primary care medical and dental resident positions supported by Teaching Health Centers (Cumulative) (Outcome) FY 2021: 792 Target: 740 (Target Exceeded) 740 1,105 + 365 2200.02 Percentage of Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education - supported medical and dental residents training in rural and/or medically underserved communities (Outcome) FY 2021: 96% Target: 80% (Target Exceeded) 80% 85% + 5 percentage points THCGME Program Outputs Year and Most Recent Result Number of primary care residents funded by THCGME residencies FY 2021: 932 Number of primary care residents completing training FY 2021: 296 Percent of residents who are from a disadvantaged and/or rural background FY 2021: 32% Percent of primary care resident program completers who intend to practice in primary care settings FY 2021: 62% 53 Reflects the number of resident FTEs supported at the start of the fiscal year. 182 Grants Awards Table: FY 2022 Final FY 2023 Enacted FY 2024 President's Awards 72 83 83 Average Award $2,172,203 $2,152,956 $2,280,000 Range of - FTE 48 48 48 --- Authorizing Legislation: Title IV of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, Public Law 99 -660 as amended by Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Section 6403, Public Law 111 -148. FY ................................ ............................... User Fee Program Program Description The National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) is a workforce tool that improves health care quality, promotes patient safety, and deters fraud and abuse in the health care system by providing information about past adverse actions of practitioners, providers, and suppliers to authorized health care entities and agencies. With more than 1.7 million reports since its inception in 1990, the NPDB helps reduce health care fraud and abuse by collecting and disclosing information to authorized entities on health care -related civil judgments and criminal convictions, adverse licensure and certification actions, exclusions from health care programs, and other adjudicated actions taken against health care providers, suppliers, and practitioners. Authorized health care en tities use this information to make informed hiring, credentialing, and privileging decisions to ultimately determine whether, or under what conditions, it is appropriate for health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers to provide health care servic es. Budget Request The FY 2024 Request for the National Practitioner Data Bank of $18.8 million in user fees is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted Level . This is based on HRSA's projections of queries on practitioners and organizations. As mandated by the He alth Care Quality Improvement Act, the NPDB does not receive appropriated funds and is financed by the collection of user fees. Annual Appropriations Act language since FY 1993 requires that user fee collections cover the full cost of NPDB operations; ther efore, there is no request for appropriations for operating the NPDB. User fees are established at a level to cover all program costs to allow the NPDB to meet annual and long - term program performance goals. Fees are established based on forecasts of query volume to 184 result in adequate, but not excessive, revenues to pay all program costs to meet program performance goals. Funding History The table below shows the user fees (revenue) collected (or expected to be collected): Fiscal Year Prior to the NPDB's inception, health care providers who lost their licenses or had serious unprofessional conduct could move from state to state with impunity, making it difficult for employers and licensing boards to learn about their prior acts. The NPD B provides employers and other authorized health care entities reliable information on health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers. In FY 2022, the NPDB responded to more than 11.5 million queries, an increase of more than 1.0 million queries ov er FY 2021, from authorized health care entities, practitioners, providers, and suppliers. The HRSA Division of Practitioner Data Bank (DPDB) continues to operate its attestation initiatives for HRSA's community health centers, hospitals, health plans, medical malpractice payers, all other health care entities, and authorized agents. To date, the attestation completion rate for selected health centers, hospitals, health plans, medical malpractice payers, all other health care entities, and authorized agent s is over 90 percent. The NPDB has improved services to health care practitioners by enabling digitally certified self -query responses, providing a paperless process with faster response times and assurances that the responses are unaltered. Fifty -three p ercent of self -queriers in FY 2022 opted for paperless responses. Practitioners can now view all of their reports through a single account. Sustained efforts to enhance user self -service has resulted in the NPDB's transaction to case ratio increasing by 27 percent, from 172 transactions per case in FY 2019 to 218 transactions per case in FY 2022. In an FY 2021 survey, the NPDB had a satisfaction rate of over 90 percent among entity users, and over 94 percent agreed that the information from the NPDB makes t heir organization confident about the decisions they make concerning practitioners. 54 The decline in revenue collected in FY 2020 was due to the NPDB temporarily waiving query fees between March 1, 20 20, and September 30, 2020 in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. 185 Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result /Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 FY 2024 2210.01: Increase the number of practitioners enrolled by health care entities in the National Practitioner Data Bank's Continuous Query subscription service FY 2021: 2210.02: Increase annually the number of disclosures of National Practitioner Data Bank reports to health care organizations FY 2021: 2,002,218 Target: 2,020,000 (Target Not Met) 2,130,000 2,150,000 +20,000 186 Supporting the Mental Health of the Health Professions Workforce Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Section 764, as Grant/Cooperative Agreement/Contract Program Description The Supporting the Mental Health of the Health Professions Workforce program will provide funding to support the implementation of evidence -informed strategies to help the health care workforce respond to workplace stressors, better endure hardships, reduc e burnout, and foster healthy workplace environments that promote mental health and resilience. Health and Public Safety Workforce Resiliency Training Program (HPSWRTP): This program supports the planning, developing, operating, or participation of healt h professions and nursing training activities, using evidence -based or evidence -informed strategies, to reduce and address burnout, suicide, mental health conditions, and substance use disorders and to promote resiliency among public safety officers and he alth care professionals, health care students, residents, trainees, and paraprofessionals in rural and medically underserved communities. Award recipients use grants funds to: (1) provide short -term training to promote resiliency; (2) create and advance tr aining interventions, protocols, and system -wide approaches to reduce and address burnout, suicide, mental health conditions, and substance use disorders; and (3) develop innovative sustainability practices/models to promote provider resiliency and prevent or reduce health care professional burnout. Promoting Resilience and Mental Health Among Health Professional Workforce (PRMHW): This program supports entities providing health care, health care providers associations, and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), taking into consideration the needs of rural and medically underserved communities, to establish, enhance, or expand evidence -informed or evidenced -based programs or protocols to promote resilience, mental health, and wellness among their providers, other personnel, and members. The goal of the PRMHW Program is to help health care organizations adopt, promote, implement, and demonstrate an organizational culture of wellness that includes resilience and mental health for their health profess ional workforce. Supporting the Mental Health of the Health Professions Workforce: The program authorized under Section. 764A of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, and will support health care FY 2022 Final --- $25,000,000 +$25,000,000 FTE --- --- 2 --- 187 providers, including medical professional associations, to e stablish or expand evidence -informed programs dedicated to promoting mental and behavioral health among their employees or members who are working on the front lines of the COVID -19 pandemic. The goal of the Promote Mental Health Among the Health Professio ns Workforce Program is to implement new programs or protocols or to expand existing programs or protocols to promote mental and behavioral health among health professional employees or members who are currently providing or who have provided services to p atients diagnosed with COVID -19. In FY 2024, HRSA is planning a new $25 million competition to support health care entities that provide health care services, such as hospitals, community health centers, and rural health clinics, or to medical profession al associations, to transform organizational cultures that promote wellness, resilience, and mental health of the health care professional workforce using established or enhanced evidence -based or evidence -informed programs. HRSA anticipates making 23 awar ds with a period of performance of three years. Eligible Entities: Health care entities, including entities that provide health care services, such as hospitals, community health centers, and rural health clinics, or to medical professional associations. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $25 million is $25 million above the FY 2023 Enacted Level. This request will fund 23 awards to support health care organizations to adopt, promote, implement, and demonstrate an organizational culture of we llness and mental health for their health professional wellness. Promoting the mental health and well -being of our nation's frontline health workers is a priority for the Administration and supports HRSA's goal to foster a health workforce and health infrastructure able to address current and emerging needs. COVID -19 has compounded rates of depression and anxiety among health care workers. The relentless physical and emotional demands of treating patients during a pandemic have exacerbated longstanding bar riers to workplace well -being. The program will support health care entities, including entities that provide health care services, such as hospitals, community health centers, and rural health clinics, or to medical professional associations, to establish or enhance evidence -based or evidence informed programs dedicated to improving mental health for health care professionals. Funds may be used to disseminate best practices and conduct a review on improving health care professiona l mental health and the outcomes of programs authorized under the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, P.L 117 -105. 188 The Budget Request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, a nd information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount FY 2020 --- FY 2021 Accomplishments: In Academic Year (AY) 2021 -2022, the first year of the HPSWRTP and PRMHW Programs and the most recent year for which performance data is available, 52,727 health professionals, health support staff, public safety officers, medical residents, and students p articipated in burnout prevention and provider resiliency programs through the HPSWRTP and PRMHW Programs. Health and Public Safety Workforce Resiliency Training Program: In Academic Year (AY) 2021 -2022, the first year of HPSWRTP and the most recent yea r for which performance data is available, the HPSWRTP trained 14,782 health and public safety employees and students. Twenty -six percent of health and public safety employees and students completed their resiliency program during the academic year, while 74 percent participated in resiliency programs that continued into AY 2022 -2023. As the HPSWRTP began in January 2022, awardees only had six months' worth of activities to report, but during that short time frame they still developed 72 new resiliency prog rams and enhanced 39 existing resiliency programs, which covered topics such as provider wellness/wellbeing (66 percent) and suicide, depression, anxiety, and substance use (eight percent). Awardees offered 87 unique resiliency - focused continuing education courses to health professionals, health support staff, and public safety officers. These courses were tailored to reach different levels of staff and management: front line workers and program staff (75 percent), program managers and mid -level supervisors (18 percent), and senior managers/executive leadership (seven percent). Seventy -four percent of the continuing education courses were online, but courses with in -person components were held at locations convenient to the health and public safety workforce , such as hospitals, emergency rooms, and specialty clinics (47 percent); academic institutions (32 percent); Federally Qualified Health Centers, Look -alikes, or Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers (seven percent); public safety facilities (e.g., fire departments) (five percent); and community -based organizations (five percent). Promoting Resilience and Mental Health Among Health Professional Workforce: In Academic Year 2021 -2022, the first year of the PRMHW program and the most recent year for which performance data is available, the PRMHW program trained 37,945 health care providers and staff through employee resiliency programs that will continue throughout the three -year grant period. Participating employees included 6,850 nurses, 3,091 physi cians, 875 behavioral health providers, 591 physician assistants, 7,064 other medical staff, and 19,474 non - medical staff. As the PRMHW program began in January 2022, awardees only had six months' 189 worth of program activities and retention data to report, b ut even during that short time frame, participation in a PRMHW employee resiliency program was associated with increased retention, particularly among behavioral health providers and nurses. Overall, 93 percent of PRMHW - enrolled employees remained in their organization at the end of the academic year. For behavioral health providers, 89 percent of enrollees in PRMHW employee resiliency programs remained at their organization at the end of the academic year, compared to 85 percent of non - participating behavi oral health providers. Likewise, 95 percent of nurses enrolled in PRMHW employee resiliency programs remained at their organization at the end of the academic year, compared to 90 percent of non -participating nurses. Eighty -nine percent of PRMHW employee resiliency programs occurred at hospitals; 68 percent of the programs were at health care delivery sites located in medically underserved communities.

Competitive Grant Program Description The Health Care Workforce Innovation Program will help grow the health care workforce by funding new, leading edge health profession education and training models that will expand the supply of health care professionals in underserved and rural areas. New approaches funded through this competitive initiative will aim to combat systemic barriers to educational opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions to increase matriculation in and graduation from health professionals training programs, as well as the number of individuals who chose to provide clinical care upon graduation. Training should better align with the type of health care that Americans hope to receive - high quality, comprehensive, convenient, and compassionate. Examples of innovat ive models may include approaches such as: Developing new health professions admission models to better reflect and meet community health needs; Revamping health professions pre -admission readiness programs to better serve students from rural, underserved, or disadvantaged backgrounds; Building training and employment models that better integrate clinical practitioners into faculty development programs; Building a training -to-practice model for behavioral health professionals; and Expanding career pathway s by creating career ladders for paraprofessionals. Innovative, community -driven approaches to health professions education are needed today more than ever. The National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has identified current projected shortages throu gh 2035 in a wide range of health care occupations. The Surgeon General has identified health worker burnout as a majority concern that will require multi -faceted solutions, including how workers are prepared and trained to practice. Many training curricul a and models for training health professionals, particularly in medicine, remain unchanged from decades ago; they do not fully leverage the technology available today. FY 2022 Final --- $27,540,000 +$27,540,000 FTE --- --- 3 --- 194 Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $27.5 million is $27.5 above the FY 2023 Enacted Level. This request will support 13 new awards. The Health Care Workforce Innovation Program seeks to seed innovative approaches and jumpstart new strategies to grow the health care workforce at a time of significant concern about workforce shortages across physicians, nursing, behavioral health. Confronting the breadth and urgency of current workforce challenges - and delivering on the promise of the Administration's significant policy steps in support of behavioral health, health care coverage, and care in home and community settings - will require innovative new approaches to accelerate the transformation of health care workforce training into a more modern, robust, and diverse workforce pipeline. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

This includes two new measures that assess how BHW is expanding access to quality health services in community settings and underserved areas (Measures 2000.05 and 2000.06). 55 Looking across the BHW's programs that collect individual -level data, 50 percent of graduates and program completers were underrepresented minorities and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds, which exceeded the FY 2021 target of 46 percent for Measure 2000.01. Fifty -one percent of st udents and health care professionals in BHW programs trained in underserved communities, which did not meet the FY 2021 target of 55 percent for Measure 2000.02. BHW did not meet the target because at different times during the COVID -19 pandemic, programs conducted training virtually rather than in underserved communities. When looking at graduates and alumni of BHW programs, 59 percent were employed in underserved areas at program completion, which set an FY 2021 baseline for Measure 2000.06. BHW met the F Y 2021 target for Measure 2000.03: the percentage of individuals supported by BHW who completed a primary care training program and are currently employed in underserved areas (40 percent). This calculation is based on service location data for students wh o graduated from or completed their BHW program in AY 2020 -2021 and reported follow -up employment data one year later in AY 2021 -2022. Two of BHW's cross -cutting measures focus on the health care delivery sites where BHW awardees provide training (Measure s 2000.04 and 2000.05). Seventy -seven percent of BHW clinical training sites provided interprofessional training, which exceeded the FY 2021 target of 50 percent for Measure 2000.04. BHW exceeded the target because the Bureau has been focusing on increasin g the amount of interprofessional training in its programs. In addition, 25 percent of clinical training sites were in community -based settings, which set an FY 2021 baseline for Measure 2000.05. Health care delivery sites in community -based settings (e.g. , Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Rural Health Clinics) are vital sources of primary care in underserved areas. 55 BHW health professions training and loan programs have varying types of data reporting requirements based on the program's authorizing legislation. Using only those programs that are requ ired to report individual -level data in the calculation ensures a higher level of accuracy and data quality, as well as consistency in the types of programs that are included in the calculati on.

The activities authorized as part of the MCH Block Grant program include the State MCH Block Grant program, Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS), and Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS) grants. The MCH Block Grant program funding, combined with state investments, improves access to quality health care services for mothers, children, and their families in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and other jurisdictions. The MCH Block Grant program enables each state to: Assure access to quality maternal and child health care services to mothers and children, especially those with low incomes or limited availability of care; Reduce infant mortality; 56 Retroactively adjusted to reflect shift in funding from SPRANS for Innovation for Mater nal Health, Integrated Services for Pregnant and Postpartum Women, and Implicit Bias Training for Health Care Providers to their own budget lines as new authorities enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act , 2022 (PL 117 -103). Adjustments also reflect shift in funding for The Maternal Mental Health Hotline from SPRANS to its own budget line as a new authority enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (PL 117 -328). 57 Reflects funds shifted out SPRANS for four new authorities noted above. 58 Reflects funds shifted out SPRANS for four new authorities noted above. 199 Provide access to prenatal, delivery, and postna tal care to women, especially pregnant women who are low income and at -risk for adverse maternal health outcomes; Increase regular screenings and follow -up diagnostic and treatment services for children who are low income; Provide access to preventive and primary care services for children who are low income and rehabilitative services for children with special health needs; Implement family -centered, coordinated health and social services and supports for children with special health care needs; and Set up toll-free hotlines and assistance with applying for services to pregnant women with infants and children eligible for Medicaid. State MCH Block Grant Program The Title V State MCH Block Grant Program, a partnership between the federal government and states, awards formula grants to 59 states and jurisdictions to address the health needs of mothers, infants, and children, as well as children with special health care needs in their state or jurisdiction . Nearly 60 million pregnant women, infants, and children, including children with special health care needs, benefitted from a service supported by the State MCH Block Grant program in FY 2021. Nationwide, the 59 State MCH Block Grant programs reached approximately 92 percent of pregnant wo men, 98 percent of infants, and 58 percent of children. The MCH Block Grant Program gives states flexibility in meeting their unique health needs, while HRSA assures accountability and impact through performance measurement and technical assistance. Additi onally, HRSA continues to implement efforts to reduce administrative burden , and improve accountability . HRSA distributes funding based on a legislative funding formula tied to a state's level of child poverty compared to the overall level of child pover ty in the United States. Federal funds, combined with required state matching investments, support activities that address an individual state's MCH needs . The program reports progress annually, and HRSA provides technical assistance on request to assist s tates in improving performance. A comprehensive needs assessment is required by law every five years to determine each state's highest MCH priorities . The State MCH Block Grant program continues to play an important role as a payer of last resort to address gaps in coverage and services not covered by Medicaid/ Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and other third -party payers. In addition to gap -filling direct and enabling services, state MCH programs promote access and quality of care through q uality improvement initiatives, workforce training, outreach, and disease prevention and health promotion. HRSA also provides technical assistance to states in addressing their MCH priority needs, as well as performance and programmatic requirements of th e MCH Block Grant program. HRSA makes state -reported financial, program, performance, and health indicator data available to the public through the Title V Information System .59 Special Projects of Regiona l and National Significance (SPRANS) 59 Title V Information System (TVIS). https://mchb.tvisdata.hrsa.gov/ 200 SPRANS grants address national or regional needs, priorities, or emerging issues and demonstrate methods for improving care and outcomes for mothers and children. Of the $212.1 million for SPRANS in FY 2023, Congress set aside approximately 8 percent to address four specific priorities: oral health, epilepsy, sickle cell disease, and fetal alcohol syndrome. Congress has also directed approximately 62 percent of funds to address priority issues, such as maternal mortal ity and morbidity initiatives, early childhood development initiatives, and regional pediatric pandemic preparedness efforts, among other priorities. The remainder supports additional activities authorized by statute. SPRANS awards drive innovation, help improve systems of care for MCH populations, and enable efforts to address emerging issues. Funding complements MCH Block Grant activities by building capacity through pilot programs, research, data collection, quality improvement, and workforce developme nt. Critical and Emerging Issues in Maternal and Child Health Maternal mortality - HRSA supports investments with SPRANS funding that are integral to HRSA's efforts to promote maternal health and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. In FY 2023, HRSA continued support for the State Maternal Health Innovation Program, which supports state-specific actions that address disparities in maternal health and improve maternal health outcomes, including the prevention and reduction of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. Reducing health disparities - SPRANS funding has been vit al to support efforts to reduce health disparities in communities across the country. The National MCH Workforce Development Center launched a new effort to help states implement, evaluate, sustain , and advance practices designed to reduce health dispariti es within their state/jurisdiction. SPRANS also supports a new investment to establish a research network that is comprised of and supports minority -serving institutions to study health disparities in maternal health outcomes. COVID -19\u2014 SPRANS funding has been instrumental in addressing emerging public health issues that impact the MCH population, including COVID -19. The SPRANS - funded National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) is an annual, cross -sectional, address -based survey that collects information on the health and well -being of approximately 30,000 children ages 0 -17 and related health care, family, and community - level factors. The 2021 NSCH produced actionable data, which is publicly available, on COVID -related issues, such as missed preventive care visits due to the coronavirus pandemic and reasons for missed care (past 12 months) and interruptions in childcare arrangements (past 12 months). Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS) CISS grants help states and communities build a comprehensive, integrated system of care to improve access and outcomes for all children, including children with special health care needs. For example, CISS funding supports the Early Childhood Comprehensiv e Systems (ECCS) program, which helps states improve access to and quality of preventive health and support services for people who are pregnant or have young children. As a result of the program, 20 states are engaging more family representatives as leade rs in designing better health systems, 201 connecting services across health, social services, and other sectors, and planning specific improvements to state, local and/or program policies and practices that advance health equity and ensure children are thrivi ng at age three and school -ready by age five. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program of $937.3 million is $121.6 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. The request includes $593.3 million for formula awards to states to promote and improve the health and wel l-being of the nation's mothers, children (including children with special needs), and their families. Additionally, the request includes $333.7 million in SPRANS funding, an increase of $121.6 million. The SPRANS funding includes $145 million to suppor t HRSA's efforts t o improve maternal health, with a specific focus on areas with high rates of adverse maternal health outcomes or with racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes. This funding includes: Addressing Emerging Issues and Social Determinants of Maternal Health : $55.0 million for community -based organizations to reduce maternal mortality and adverse maternal health outcomes, particularly in areas with high rates of adverse maternal health outcomes and/or significant racial and ethn ic disparities in maternal health outcomes. Projects could include investments in maternal mental health equity, addressing social determinants of maternal health, promoting equity in maternal health outcomes through digital tools, and expanding the use of technology -enabled collaborative learning and capacity -building models for pregnant and postpartum individuals. Growing and Diversifying the Doula Workforce : $25.0 million to provide grants to community -based organizations to develop and/or expand progr ams to recruit doula candidates ( health workers who provide support before, during and after childbirth), support their training/certification, and then employ them as doulas to support improved birth outcomes in the community. HRSA will also use $5 millio n requested in FY 2024 to coordinate with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to support states in offering coverage for doulas. Funding for Minority -Serving Institutions: $10.0 million for awarding funds through a research network to suppor t minority -serving institutions to study health disparities in maternal health outcomes; and to develop curricula for training health professionals on identifying and addressing the risks associated with climate change for vulnerable individuals and indivi duals who intend to become pregnant. State Maternal Health Innovation Awards : $55.0 million to continue to support state- specific actions that address disparities in maternal health and improve maternal health outcomes, including the prevention and reducti on of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. The request also provides $40 million in SPRANS funding to support a pilot initiative to integrate behavioral health supports in community settings to promote the healthy social and emotional devel opment and mental health needs of mothers, children , and their families. Grants will support traditionally underserved communities, including those within Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas, to engage and train community -based organizations (CBOs) t o identify and address the mental and behavioral health needs of mothers and children, support children's social and emotional development, and build community trust and expertise to help 202 reduce disparities in access to behavioral health care. If more inte nsive care is needed, n avigators and community health workers will facilitate linkages to local resources, such as medical homes, school -based and other community health centers, community -based organizations, and local community social supports and servic es. Partnerships between CBOs and mental and behavioral health providers can enhance local mental health service delivery as CBOs help integrate clinicians into the community setting. Additional SPRANS funding supports programs that will drive innovation , improve systems of care, and address emerging issues related to disparities for MCH populations. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, collection and reporting of perf ormance and outcome measure data to include the National Survey on Children's Health, and information technology and other program support costs. Table 1. MCH Block Grant Activities ($ in thousands) MCH Activities FY 2022 Final FY 2023 Enacted in SPRANS Accomplishments As a longstanding source of funding for MCH populations, the State MCH Block Grant supports a wide range of services for millions of women and children, including low -income children and children with special health care needs. Program achievements include: Nearly 60 million pregnant women, infants, and children, including children with special health care needs, benefitted from a service supported by the State MCH Block Grant program in FY 2021. Nationwide, the 59 State MCH Block Grant programs reached approximately 92 percent of pregnant women, 98 percent of infants, and 58 percent of children. Access to health services for mothers has improved with the support of the State MCH Block Grant program. Women receiving early prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy increased from 71.0 percent i n 2007 to 78.3 percent in 2021. Recognizing the importance of improving women's health before pregnancy, 47 states and jurisdictions are now working to improve access to preventive and primary care for all women of childbearing age. The infant mortality ra te is a widely used indicator of the nation's health. The State MCH Block Grant program has played a lead role in the 25 percent decline in U.S. infant mortality from 7.2 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1997 to 5.4 infant deaths per 1,000 live birth s in 2021. States are also working to reduce maternal mortality, which has risen over the past two decades. Fifty State MCH Block Grant programs provided funding to support comprehensive maternal mortality reviews to identify contributing factors to mater nal death, monitor trends, and/or initiate steps to reduce such events in the future.63 States use 60 Retroactively adjusted to reflect shift in funding from SPRANS for Innovation for Maternal Health, Integrated Services for Pregnant and Postpartum Women, and Implicit Bias Training for Health Care Providers to their own budget lines as new authorities ena cted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act , 2022 (PL 117 -103) 61 Reflects funds shifted out SPRANS for three new authorities noted above. 62 Reflects funds shifted out SPRANS for three new authorities noted above. 63 Based on reporting in the FY 2021/FY 201 9 Title V Application/Annual Reports . 204 MCH Block Grant funds for activities such as promoting well -woman visits, increasing access to prenatal care, and enhancing systems of care for maternal ment al health. States are reducing disparities. For example, Rhode Island recently implemented a collaborative, community -led, and data -driven process to address the unique social, economic, and environmental factors that are preventing people from reaching th eir optimal health, with a goal of advancing equity in those communities . One community implemented a program to prevent childhood obesity and promote physical activity and healthier eating that reached over 19,000 children and adolescents.64 Select Nati onal Outcome and National Performance Measures in effect from 1997 to 2021 illustrate the program's successes: National Outcome or Performance Measures Percent Change (1997 - 2021 unless otherwise noted) Data Source Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births 25% decrease National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Neonatal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 27% decrease NVSS Postneonatal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 24% decrease NVSS Perinatal mortality rate per 1,000 live births plus fetal deaths 22% decrease (1997 -2019) NVSS Child mortality rate, ages 1 through 9 per 100,000 children 32% decrease NVSS Percent of children who have completed the combined 7 -vaccine (includes Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Polio, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Haemophilus Influenza, and Hepatitis B) series by age 24 months65 5% increase (2011 -2018) National Immunization Survey (NIS) Percentage of children without health insurance 71% decrease National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Percent of infants breastfed exclusively through 6 months of age 80% increase (2007 -2019) NIS Percent of infants born to pregnant women receiving prenatal care beginning in the first trimester 10% increase (2007 -2021) NVSS 64 The 5-2-1-0 program promotes eating 5 fruits and vegetables, engaging in no more than 2 hours of recreational screen time, getting 1 hour of exercise, and drinking 0 sugary drinks per day. 65 Childhood vaccination mea sure definition has been updated to align with CDC reporting of vaccination rates by birth year cohort. 205 Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result /Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY 2023 2024 Target FY 2024 +/- FY 2023 3010.01 : The percentage of children served by the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant (Outcome) FY 2021: 60% Target: 58% (Target Exceeded) 63% 63% Maintain 3010.02 : The percentage of pregnant women served by the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant (Outcome) FY 2021: 92% Target: 87% (Target Exceeded) 93% 93% Maintain 3010.03 : Decrease the ratio of the Black infant mortality rate to the White infant mortality ra te (Output) FY 2021: 2.4 to 1 Target: 2 to 1 (Target Not Met) 2 to 1 2 to 1 Maintain 3010.04 : Reduce the infant mortality rate (Outcome) FY 2021: 5.4 per 1,000 Target: 5.5 per 1,000 (Target Met) 5.4 per 1,000 5.3 per 1,000 -0.1 per 1,000 3010.05 : Reduce the incidence of low birth weight births (Outcome) FY 2021: 8.5% Target: 7.8% (Target Not Met) 8% 8% Maintain 3010.06 : Increase percentage of pregnant women who received prenatal care in the first trimester.

In FY 2023, funding was appropriated under this new authority for AIM, which had previously been funded under the Social Security Act, Title V Section 501(a)(2) in the Maternal and Child Heal th Block Grants - Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) program . The Innovation for Maternal Health program authorizes the establishment or continuation of a program to identify, develop, or disseminate best practices to improve m aternal health care quality and outcomes, improve maternal and infant health, and eliminate preventable maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity, among other activities. In FY 2024, HRSA will continue the AIM program under this new legislative auth ority. HRSA supports investments to promote maternal health and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. The AIM program promotes safety and quality of care during and immediately after childbirth and works to reduce disparities in health outcomes based o n race and ethnicity. AIM improves maternity care across the country by developing and implementing patient safety bundles, which are sets of small, straightforward, evidence -based practices. When these practices are implemented collectively and reliably i n the delivery setting, they improve patient outcomes and reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity in hospitals, other birthing facilities, community -based organizations, and outpatient clinical settings . The bundles do not introduce new gui delines but bring together the existing evidence -based recommendations and resources to facilitate rapid implementation within birthing facilities. As of November 2022, there are seven patient safety bundles. AIM state enrollees can choose which bundle(s) to implement, according to their needs and priorities. These bundles address the following topics: Obstetric Hemorrhage 211 Severe Hypertension in Pregnancy Safe Reduction of Primary Cesarean Birth Cardiac Conditions in Obstetrical Care Care for Pregnant and P ostpartum People with Substance Use Disorder Postpartum Discharge Transition Sepsis in Obstetrical Care HRSA continues to support expanded implementation of the AIM program's patient safety bundles within additional birthing facilities in new and enrolled U.S. States, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and tribal entities, and disseminate tested bundles to a broader array of providers, health care settings, and organizations within communities across the U.S. As of October 2022, 48 states and the District of Columbia are enrolled in AIM, with participation from 1,841 birthing facilities. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) program of $15.3 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level for this program. This request will provide targeted support through grants to states, jurisdictions, U.S. territories, and tribal communities to expand the reach, depth, and quality of AIM throughout the country. These grants aim to improve the quality and safety of maternal health care nationwide and reduce maternal health disparities through the increase in the number of birthing facilities implementing and sustaining bundles as well as the continued delivery of bundles and data collection /reporting. This request additionally supports technical assistance to expand implementation and reach of AIM program activities to all birthing facilities within the 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and tribal communities. The technical assistance will also support AIM data collection. The funding request additionally includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program suppor t costs. Funding History Fiscal Year $15,300,000 212 Program Accomplishments Sample accomplishments from states showing improvements from implementation of the AIM safety bundles include: Michigan : In Michigan, hemorrhage is among the three leading causes of pregnancy - related death. Between November 2016 to December 2020, 56 of the state's 80 birthing facilities participate d in implementation of AIM's Obstetric Hemorrhage patient safety bundle with Michigan AIM. As part of this effort, participating facilities received technical assistance, site visits, education, and data support. From 2011 -2015 to 2016 - 2020, the statewide severe maternal morbidity (SMM) rate among birthing patients who experienced a hemorrhage, excluding those who only received blood transfusions, declined from 11% to 5%, an overall reduction of Iowa's nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex (NTSV) cesarean birth rate exceeding the Healthy People 2030 target rate of 23.6%, the Iowa Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (IMQCC) began implementation of AIM's Safe Reduction of Primary Cesarean Birth patient safety bundle in 43 of the state's 56 bir thing facilities. Since the start of implementation in May 2021, participating facilities have received monthly education on evidence -based practices, quality improvement, and family -centered care. Provisional data show a 16% reduction in the statewide rat e of NTSV cesarean births from 25.0% in Q1 2021 to 21.1% in Q1 2022. During the same time, non -participating facilities experienced an increased rate of low -risk (NTSV) cesarean births. Alaska: Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are increasing in Alaska, and hypertensive disorders contributed to one third of the pregnancy -related deaths in Alaska between 2012 and 2016. Based on these data and feedback from key stakeholders, the Alaska Perinatal Quality Collaborative (AKPQC) engaged six hospitals, represen ting 63% of Alaska births, in implementation of the AIM Severe Hypertension in Pregnancy patient safety bundle. As a result of this initiative and efforts of participating hospitals, the statewide percent of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) among people wit h preeclampsia, excluding blood transfusions alone, decreased from 7.7% in 2018 to 4.1% in 2020, the lowest percentage in the most recent five years. During this period, statewide SMM among people with preeclampsia, excluding blood transfusions alone, decr eased from 10.8% to 3.9% for Non -Hispanic White people and from 5.5% to 3.4% for American Indian and Alaska Native people.

The Training for Health Care Providers program addresses p erceptions and biases among maternal health care providers that may affect the approach to, and provision of, care to reduce health disparities and improve maternal health outcomes. Disparities persist in the rates of maternal mortality in the United Sta tes, with maternal deaths affecting a higher proportion of Black women compared to White women.69 Research shows that provider bias can play a role in higher rates of morbidity and mortality among Black women.70 The Listening to Mothers III survey found th at approximately one in five Black and Hispanic women indicated concerns with treatment from hospital -based care providers because of their race, ethnicity, cultural background, and/or language.71 Health care quality, starting at preconception and continuing through postpartum care, is a critical lever to improve outcomes for women, including those from racial and ethnic minority groups.72 There is growing 69 Hoyert DL.

The Integrated Services for Pregnant and Postpartum Women program helps states, Indian Tribes, and tribal organizations establish or operate innovative programs to effectively deliver care for pregnant and postpartum people while consid ering their social, behavioral, and health care needs. These programs coordinate appropriate services and supports across care providers to improve outcomes. The program aims to reduce negative maternal health outcomes, pregnancy - related deaths, and matern al health disparities, including racial and ethnic disparities by taking a whole -person approach to care. Approximately four million births occur in the United States each year.76 Despite advances in medical care and investments in improving access to care, rates of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity (SMM)77 have not improved.78 In 2020, there were 861 maternal deaths in the United States, representing a maternal mort ality rate of 23.8 per 100,000 live births.79 In addition, as many as 60,000 women in the United States experience unexpected outcomes during 76 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr72/nvsr72 -01.pdf 77 Severe maternal morbidity includes unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that result in significant short - or long-term consequences to a women's health. 78 https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/severematernalmorbidity.html 79 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal -mortality/2020/maternal -mortality -rates -2020.htm 217 labor or delivery that have serious short - or long -term effects on their health and well -being.80 Significant mate rnal health disparities exist with outcomes varying by race, ethnicity, geography, and select indicators of socio -economic status.81 HRSA is committed to reducing these maternal health disparities by addressing the social determinants of health and improv ing the quality of maternal health care. To address the high rates of adverse maternal health outcomes, additional demonstrations and programs need to test innovative strategies, identify the most effective approaches, and accelerate progress toward achiev ing equitable maternal health outcomes. One such strategy is the Pregnancy Medical Home (PMH) model. Some areas of the United States are testing and demonstrating the benefits of the PMH model, which organizes and coordinates the often -fragmented network o f social, behavioral, and health care services and focuses on promoting evidence -based care management to improve outcomes for people with Medicaid benefits. Early evaluations of PMH models show some evidence of positive impact on birth outcomes.82 More ev idence is needed to demonstrate and determine the impact of the PMH model on maternal health, including the reduction of health disparities. HRSA seeks to build the evidence for integrated models of care, like PMH, through this program. First funded in FY 2023, this program advances the goals of the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis.83 The program funds projects that either test an existing model like PMH that integrate care and services, or develop, implement, and test ne w models in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including: State, Tribal, and local agencies responsible for Medicaid, public health, social services, mental health, and substance use disorder treatment and services; Health care providers that serve pregnant and postpartum individuals; Community -based health organizations and health workers, including providers of home visiting services and individuals representing communities with disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality and severe m aternal morbidity. Core program components include: Systematically assessing pregnant individuals' risks for adverse maternal health outcomes; Implementing pregnancy care management and care coordination for individuals at greater risk for adverse materna l health outcomes, including referral and linkages to specialized care and support services to address unmet clinical, behavioral, and social needs; Improving quality of care delivered during pregnancy and the postpartum period, up to 12 months -Blueprint.pdf 218 Establishing a diverse workforce, to support pregnancy care management, care coordination, and quality improvement in health care practices; Enhancing data systems to establish baseline data, guide quality improvement, and track performance measures a nd outcomes; and Ensuring activities focus on equal treatment, inclusion, and accessibility. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Integrated Services for Pregnant and Postpartum Women program of $25 million is $15 million above the FY 2023 E nacted level. This request will continue and expand support for projects to foster the development and demonstration of innovative models that integrate care and services, such as the Pregnancy Medical Home model, to reduce negative maternal health outcome s, pregnancy -related deaths, and maternal health disparities, including racial and ethnic disparities . At this funding level, HRSA anticipates support for existing and new projects for a total of up to 12 awards. The funding request also includes costs ass ociated with the cooperative agreement review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, evaluation and technical assistance activities, information technology, and other program support costs.

The hotline was previously implemented and funded under the Social Security Act, Title V Section 501(a)(2) in the Maternal and Child Health Block Grants - Special Projects of Regional and National Significa nce (SPRANS) program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (PL 117 -328) added Section 399V -7 to Title III of the Public Health Service Act to maintain a national maternal mental health hotline to provide emotional support, information, brief intervention, and mental health and substance use disorder resources to pregnant and postpartum women at risk of, or affected by, maternal mental health and substance use disorders, and to their families or household members. HRSA launched the National Ma ternal Mental Health Hotline on Mother's Day, May 8, 2022. It provides 24/7 free, confidential emotional support, information, and referrals for those who are pregnant or postpartum and their loved ones. Professional counselors, including licensed mental health clinicians; licensed health care providers such as nurses or doctors; certified doulas or childbirth educators; and certified peer support specialists, staff the hotline and provide culturally sensitive and trauma informed support in English and Span ish via telephone and text, so people can get the help they need, when they need it. Interpreter services are available in 60 additional languages, and a relay service is available for people who are deaf or hard -of-hearing. Budget Request The FY 2024 B udget Request for the Maternal Mental Health Hotline program is $7.0 million, which is the same as the FY 2023 Enacted level. Requested funding will support continued operation of the hotline, maintain staffing capacity, and help promote widespread nationa l awareness and use of the hotline through a communications campaign and partner outreach. 220 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount FY 2020 Program Accomplishments From the launch of the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline in May 2022 through the end of calendar year 2022, hotline counselors have had more than 7,500 conversations of which approximately 70% were by phone and 30% were by tex t. The average speed of answer for phone and text has been under one minute. HRSA launched the hotline in a phased manner during its first year of implementation, which included initial outreach to relevant provider associations, national organizations, community groups, and federal partners. HRSA also developed and disseminated downloadable promotional materials in English and Spanish and continues to promote the hotline to target audiences on social media and through other channels. In FY 2024, HRSA wil l continue and expand this outreach, including to pregnant women , new parents and their support networks, and the health and social service providers who care for them. 221 Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities FY 2022 Final 9 --- Authorizing Legislation: Section 399BB of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Public Law 116 -60 FY 2024 Authorization ................................ Competitive grant/co -operative agreement Other Program Description The Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program improves care and outcomes for children, adolescents, and young adults with autism and other developmental disabilities (DD). The program does this primarily by: Training healthcare professionals to screen, refer and provide services for children with Autism/DD; Supporting autism research networks and programs; and Ensuring state health agencies implement best practices . Through these efforts, the program also aims to increase access to early screeni ng, diagnosis, and treatment for children and youth with autism/DD, and to increase public awareness of the issues affecting these children and families. Finally, the program aims to promote health equity by engaging diverse families and self -advocates in program design and implementation, and targeting populations affected by discrimination primarily due to disability status. The Combating Autism Act of 2006 authorized this program, which began operating in 2008. The Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support (Autism CARES) Act reauthorized the program in 2019. 222 Training Program The Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities training programs are Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Other Related Disabilities (LEND) and Developmental -Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP). The LEND program supports interdisciplinary training for health care and related students and professionals on addressing the needs of children with autism/DD. LEND training opportunities are academic, clinical, leadership, and community oriented. The DBP program helps prepare fellows in developmental -behavio ral pediatrics for leadership roles as teachers, researchers, and clinicians. It also provides pediatric practitioners, residents, and medical students with the clinical expertise necessary to support children and youth with autism/DD. Both training prog rams have an explicit focus on training professionals to provide culturally and linguistically relevant care and to recruit diverse students and professionals into the programs. Both training programs include self -advocates and family members in a variety of ways, including as trainees and faculty to enhance exposure to lived experiences, and increase the leadership skills of self -advocates and family members as part of an interdisciplinary care team. Research Program The research components of the Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program include: Research networks Single investigator -led autism innovation projects Field -initiated research Secondary data analysis projects Areas of research include: Research and development of reliable screening tools and guidelines for autism/DD Implementation of interventions to improve the physical and behavioral health of individuals with autism/DD across the life course How to address barriers to diagnosis and access to care, and social determinants of health and health disparities, with an explicit focus on recruiting participants from underserved populations Collectively, these research investments respond to questions raised in the HHS Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) Strategic Pl an. Specific areas include improving early identification and advancing effectiveness of interventions and services for children with autism and other DD. State Systems Grants Through FY 2023, the Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program suppo rted organizations that improve access to comprehensive, coordinated health care and related services for children and youth with autism/DD and their families in medically underserved areas. This was accomplished by implementing family navigation and provi der training. These grants ended in FY 2023. 223 Demonstration Program In FY 2024, MCHB will implement a new demonstration program as part of the Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program to better address a growing challenge of supporting youth wit h autism as they transition into adulthood. This new program will focus on implementing innovative strategies to improve health outcomes for youth with autism/DD and providing support for youth with autism/DD and their families in transitioning from child to adult serving systems. The overall goal of the demonstration program is for youth with autism/DD to thrive as adults in their schools, communities, and workplaces. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Autism and Other Developmental Disabi lities program of $57.3 million is $1 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will continue support for training programs and research with a focus on improving access, quality, and systems of care for underserved children, adolescents, and y oung adults with autism or other DD. This requested funding will allow the program to serve approximately 125,000 children. This funding will also support the LEND and DBP programs to address unmet needs and disparities in evaluation, diagnosis, and trea tment. The funding increase will continue support for the DBP program including increased fellowship opportunities for existing awardees Funding also supports a new demonstration program that will focus on family and youth engagement. The National Transition Center for Autism and Epilepsy will support grantees . This center provides national leadership to grantees and other stakeholders incl uding technical assistance, training, and resources to autism demonstration grantees on family engagement, strategic partnership building, implementation science, policy analysis, assessment, and quality improvement. The Budget Request does not include fu nding for the state systems grants, as the program shifts to focus on helping youth with autism/DD transition to adulthood. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, informat ion technology, and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Program Accomplishments Recent Training Accomplishments Data from FY 2020 showed that the LEND and DBP programs collectively provided: Diagnostic services to confirm or rule out autism/DD to over 115,000 children Training to nearly 17,500 trainees in ped iatrics, developmental -behavioral pediatrics, other health professions, and people with lived experience Over 3,300 continuing education events on early screening, diagnosis, and services that reached over 270,000 pediatricians and other health professiona ls In FY 2020, long -term trainees in the program included: 24% from underrepresented racial groups 13% who identified as Hispanic or Latino Recent Research Accomplishments Accomplishments from the Autism Research Networks and Autism Single Investigator Innovation Programs in FY 2021 include: Completed 95 studies on physical and behavioral health issues related to autism/DD, screening and diagnostic measures, early intervention, and transition to adulthood Enrolled 17,857 participants in prim ary research studies through 52 research sites across the country and included 1,049,578 participants in secondary data analyses Developed 65 peer -reviewed publications in leading scholarly journals Research findings contributed to the evidence that suppor ts clinical and public health recommendations. For example, research findings from the Autism Longitudinal Data Project contributed to the evidence that support the following clinical and public health recommendations: (1) updated CDC guidelines on lowerin g lead exposure levels of health concern; and (2) consensus statement on acetaminophen use during pregnancy published in Nature Review of Endocrinology. State Systems Accomplishments During 2020 -2021, state awardees: Partnered with 6 primary care practices to implement family navigation services and participate in provider trainings.

Measure 3020.02 has been modified to disaggregate the LEND and DBP data. Measure 3020.02 now reflects LEND results whereas 3020.05 is a new measure reflecting DBP results. For measu res 3020.02, HRSA has established modest target increases for FY 2024 that are lower than the most recent results. This is because the LEND program recompeted in FY 2021 which included a new cohort of awardees that typically impacts program results in the first few years with incremental increases over the award cycle. Furthermore, the impacts of COVID -19 may influence trainee results. Since these measures track trainees 5 -years post training, impacts from COVID -19 on LEND trainees and their career paths wi ll not be reflected in the recent FY2020 results. The modest increase reflects these considerations. For measures 3020.04 and 3020.05, HRSA has established modest target increases for FY 2024 that are lower than the most recent results. This is because the DBP program recompetes in FY 2023 which will include a new cohort of awardees that is expected to impact program results. Furthermore, the impacts of COVID -19 may influence trainee results. Since these measures track trainees 5 -years post train ing, impacts from COVID -228 19 on DBP trainees and their career paths will not be reflected in the recent FY 2020 results. For measure 3020.03, the following grants are included in the FY 2021 data calculation: Autism Intervention Research Network on Behavio ral Health, Autism Intervention Research Network on Behavioral Health, Developmental -Behavioral Pediatrics Research Network, Healthy Weight Research Network for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and other Developmental Disabilities, Autism Transition s Research Project, Autism Longitudinal Data Project, Autism Single Investigator Innovation Program, and Autism Field -Initiated Innovative Research Studies Program; Autism Secondary Data Analysis Research Program grants are excluded, as they are one -year g rants.

First established in 2004, the SCDTDP was reauthorized in 2018 by the Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritab le Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention and Treatment Act (P.L. 115 -327). Sickle Cell Disease is a genetic condition where abnormal red blood cells can block blood flow to organs and tissues, causing anemia, periodic pain episodes, tissue and org an damage, and increased risk of infections and early death. SCD affects over 100,000 individuals in the U.S., and disproportionately affects Black (1 of every 365 births) and Hispanic Americans (1 of every 16,300 births).84 While advances in science and m edicine mean individuals living with SCD have an increased life expectancy, not everyone who needs therapy and treatment has been able to benefit equally. I ndividuals with SCD have unequal access to comprehensive, quality health care and treatment because the distribution of specialized providers across the U.S. and the jurisdictions is uneven; some primary care providers have less comfort treating and caring for individuals with SCD; primary care providers lack training; and social factors, such as racism, income, and stigma also play a substantial role. The program uses a regional model to address these barriers and help prevent and treat SCD complications. 84 https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html 230 Five regional SCDTDPs work collectively to improve health equity by increasing access to evidence -based care in the communities in which SCD patients live, and continuing telehealth support for access to services. The program supports partnerships between clinicians and community organizations to improve the quality of care provided to patients with SCD , and educates providers, families, and patients to improve knowledge and capacities, particularly as patients transition to adult health care settings. The Hemoglobinopathies National Coordinating Center (HNCC) provides technical assistance to the SCDTD P by leading quality improvement activities and supporting topic -specific workgroups to address priorities and emerging needs identified by grantees. The HNCC is responsible for collecting data on SCDTDP activities that informs a report to Congress, which is planned for delivery in FY 2026. In addition to developing a report to Congress, the HNCC collects information from the SCDTDP that provides clinicians, nurses, allied health professionals, community -based organizations and public health agencies with b est practices and strategies to improve sickle cell disease care. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget request for the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration program of $8.2 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will continue sup port for the regional SCD infrastructure so that individuals with SCD can lead full and productive lives regardless of where they live. SCDTDP partners with states to develop and support knowledgeable SCD care teams to improve and increase access to approp riate care; implements telehealth technologies for health care delivery, education, and health information services; increases access to evidence -based care and the latest treatment options; and increases collaboration and care coordination within each reg ion. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Program Accomplishments According to data from the last funding cycle of August 1, 2017 \u2014July 31, 2021, the program successfully reached individuals with SCD, health care providers, and the community. The following accomplishments were reported: Served over 30,000 individuals in 51 sites annually; 231 Partnered with 49 community organizations, leveraging their community expertise to link indivi duals and local families to knowledgeable providers and provide resources on treatment options and social services. This strategy ultimately improves access and quality of care for individuals with SCD. Collaborated with 200,000 health care providers thro ugh telehealth, tele -mentoring, junior faculty coaching, grand rounds, and specialized COVID -19 seminars to build capacity among local provider networks and increase the number of providers administering evidence -based SCD care.

Public Health Service Act, Title III, Section 399M, as amended by Public Law 117 -operative agreement Program Description The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program helps states, territories, families, and providers ensure that newborns, infants, and young children up to three years of age who are deaf or hard of hearing get the care they need when they need it. Early involvement can help these children meet age -appropriate language, social, and developmental milestones. This program: Recruits, educates, and trains staff and health care providers on current evidence -based practices and national EHDI system goals; Improves access to early int ervention services and language acquisition; and Improves family engagement, education, partnership, and leadership to strengthen family support. First established in 2000, the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2022 (P.L. 117 - 241) most rec ently reauthorized the program. The program funds 59 competitive grants to states and jurisdictions to develop coordinated statewide EHDI systems of care and two technical resource centers to support these efforts. The program also empowers families to s erve as leaders through activities that train families to increase their engagement and support in EHDI systems of care. Funding also supports supplemental awards to 12 Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND) training programs supported by the Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program to train future leaders in pediatric audiology. 234 Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program of $18.8 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. The Budget Request will continue to support 59 competitive grants to states and jurisdictions, technical assistance, and supplemental awards to 12 Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities training programs to train future leaders in pediatric audiology. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award proces s, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Program Accomplishments Before 1993, fewer than 1 in 10 newborns in the U.S. were screened for hearing loss, but now nearly all are screened. Since the EHDI program started, states and territories have had significant success identifying and getting services for newborns and infants with hearing loss. The EHDI Program continues to work with states to meet the Healthy People 2030 objectives of screening no later than one month of age, conducting audiologic evaluations no later t han three months of age, and enrolling in early intervention services no later than six months of age (1 -3-6 objectives). In 2020, 97.2% of infants were screened before one month of age, 60.6% were diagnosed before three months of age, and 72.4% were enrol led in early intervention before six months of age.85 Despite the progress, a lack of comprehensive data reporting requirements for service providers in states and variability across states in timely access to such providers, among other factors, continues to be a challenge. Overall system improvements have led to more infants being screened and identified as deaf or hard of hearing, and fewer infants being lost to follow -up (when an infant does not receive the recommended followup services) or lost to do cumentation (when an infant has received services, but results are undocumented as they have not been reported to the EHDI Program). In addition, the EHDI Program encourages awardees to develop an integrated EHDI health information system that allows commu nication and protected data sharing among health care providers. This ensures that newborns, infants, and young children up to three years of age receive pertinent screenings and follow -up services. 85 2020 CDC EHDI Hearing Screening & Follow -up Survey (HSFS) data. https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/ehdi -data2020.html 235 Additionally, awardees were required to develop plans to address diversity and inclusion in the EHDI system by the end of FY 2021 to ensure their activities are inclusive of and address the needs of the populations they serve. States identified priority ar eas to increase access to services, supports, and education in rural areas for non -English speaking families and increased opportunities for family engagement and leadership for diverse families. Since the program's inception, states and jurisdictions have had significant success in identifying newborns and infants who are deaf or hard of hearing. Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result /Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY 3040.01 : Percentage of infants screened for hearing loss prior to one month of age (Output) FY 2020: 97.2% Target: 98% (Target Not Met) 98% 98% Maintain 3040.02 : Percentage of infants suspected of having a hearing loss with a confirmed diagnosis by three months of age (Output) FY 2020: 60.6% Target: 77% (Target Not Met) 79% 79% Maintain 3040.03 : Increase the percentage of infants with hearing loss enrolled in early intervention before six months of age (Output) FY 2020: 72.4% Target: 72% (Target Exceeded) 73% 73% Maintain Narrative For measure 3040.02, the percent decrease in FY 2020 is due to several factors associated with the pandemic, including staffing shortages, facility closures, limited hours for outpatient procedures, families sick or quarantining, and parental hesitancy to return for follow -up services. HRSA is not lowering targets for FY 2023 and FY 2024 at this time based on the FY 2020 results since it is anticipated numbers will rebound to pre -COVID - 19 pandemic levels in future years. For comparison, the FY 2019 result f or this measure was 79.1%. \"Confirmed\" diagnosis refers to a documented diagnosis, which is consistent with terminology used in newborn hearing screening programs. Measure 3040.03 is tracked annually under Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) regulations that mandate collaboration with Title V programs and newborn 236 hearing screening programs.

Children have unique emergency care needs, especially during serious or life -threatening emergencies. The majority of the nation's children are treated in community and rur al emergency departments (EDs) close to where they live, rather than in specialized pediatric medical care centers. In addition, emergency medical services (EMS) agencies and hospital EDs often lack the necessary equipment and resources to treat children a dequately. The EMSC Program aims to ensure that all EMS agencies and hospital EDs are equipped to provide appropriate medical care for children, including access to pediatric -specific equipment, medications, and transportation (e.g., ambulances). In addit ion, EMS providers must be knowledgeable and skilled in carrying out pediatric emergency triage, procedures, and treatments while using protocols that consider the pediatric patient's developmental needs including the importance of their relationship with family. It is critical that EMS systems are optimally prepared to provide high -quality pediatric care at the site of an injury and during transportation to a hospital, also referred to as prehospital EMS, and in emergency departments, also referred to as hospital EMS. In recent years, the EMSC Program has invested in programs that interact to expand and improve pediatric emergency care across the U.S.: 238 The EMSC State Partnership Program forms a national network across the U.S. to increase uptake and adoption of evidence -based system improvements and pediatric readiness guidelines in prehospital and hospital settings. The National Pediatric Readiness in EDs project is a collaborative national initiative that assesses pediatric readiness in more than 5,000 of our nation's EDs and develops resources to expand pediatric readiness in EDs. The National Pediatric Readiness in EMS agencies project is a collabora tive national initiative that aims to assess pediatric readiness in more than 16,000 EMS agencies and develops resources to expand pediatric readiness in EMS agencies. The EMSC Innovation and Improvement Center supports quality improvement initiatives to increase implementation of evidence -based clinical guidelines, and drive expansion of pediatric readiness in EMS agencies and EDs in each state and jurisdiction. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) provides infrastructure support for research that improves pediatric emergency clinical care. The Targeted Issues program studies how expansion of pediatric emergency readiness across the nation impacts pediatric health outcomes. The EMSC Data Center tracks performance improvement effort s across all funded states and jurisdictions and serves as a central data coordinating entity for PECARN research. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Emergency Medical Services for Children program of $28.1 million is $3.8 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will provide support to states to address critical gaps that remain for expanding access to pe diatric readiness in EMS agencies and EDs to ensure that EDs have the essential guidelines and resources in place to provide effective emergency care to children. Pediatric readiness in prehospital EMS agencies is critically important for severely ill and injured children. Currently, only 25 percent of EMS agencies require EMS practitioners to demonstrate the effective use of pediatric equipment and only 36 percent have a dedicated pediatric emergency care coordinator.87 The funding request will continue t o support the EMSC State Partnership Program in helping states increase pediatric readiness in their state's EMS agencies through support for quality improvement efforts and policy initiatives. Funding will also support states in establishing Pediatric Rec ognition Programs for EMS agencies and EDs. The funding request also includes costs associated with data coordination activities, grant reviews and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs. 87 Data reported by EMSC State Partnership performance reports . 239 Funding History Fiscal Accomplishments Notable accomplishments of the EMSC Program include : Nationally Assessed the Pediatric Readiness of EDs: In 2021, HRSA collaborated with national organizations in a multi -phase survey and quality improvement initiative involving 5,150 hospitals. This survey, which had a response rate of 71%, found that the average pediatric readiness of EDs increased from 69 in 2013 to 71 in 2021, out of a total possible score of 100, which indicates that many EDs are still struggling to be optimally prepared to care for children. Pediatric readiness ensures that all U.S. EDs have access to recommended pediatric readiness guidelines and resources to provide optimal emergency care to children. Increased our Understanding of the Importance of Pediatric Readiness: In 2021, a HRSA -funded Targeted Issues study found that children w ith trauma who were cared for in a trauma center ED with lower pediatric readiness were more likely to die than children cared for in a trauma center ED with higher pediatric readiness.88 Another Targeted Issues study found that EMS transports of criticall y ill children to EDs with lower pediatric readiness, who could have been transported to EDs with higher pediatric readiness, were more likely to die.89 These findings highlight the need for hospital EDs to raise their level of pediatric readiness. Support ed the Expansion of Evidence Based Guidelines: In 2022, to improve the emergency care of children in pain, HRSA jointly funded the development of Evidence - Based Guidelines for Prehospital Pain Management.90,91 These recommendations help EMS providers learn how to safely treat pain in children as they are transported to an ED. 88 Newgard CD, Lin A, Olson LM, Smith M, Dai M, Nathens AB.

The Healthy Start Program began in 1991 under the Public Health Service Act, Title III, Part D, Section 330H (42 U.S.C 254c -8) and was reauthorized in March 2020 by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act (P.L. 116 -136). Healthy Start serves communities with infant mortality rates that are at least 1\u00bd t imes the U.S. national average and/or with high indicators of poor perinatal outcomes, particularly among non -Hispanic Black and other disproportionately affected populations. In FY 2022, Healthy Start funded 101 competitive grants to higher -risk communiti es in 35 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Healthy Start projects tailor their services to their community's needs to maximize the program's impact on the enrolled individuals as well as the overall community. Healthy Start services sta rt with community health workers reaching out to women who are at an increased risk of adverse maternal health outcomes. Each enrolled family receives a standardized, comprehensive assessment that facilitates discussion about individual and household chara cteristics, physical and behavioral health, access to and utilization of health care, health and parenting behaviors, the need for referrals to additional services, and more . Case managers provide and/or link women and families to appropriate services, inc luding: Health care services o Prenatal, postpartum, well -baby, youth care, reproductive life planning, and women's health 244 o Screening and referral to services for depression, substance use, and interpersonal violence Services that increase access to health c are and improve health outcomes o Screening and referrals for health care; insurance; and social services such as WIC, home visiting, and doula (health workers who provide support before, during, and after birth) services o Parenting skill building, self -estee m building, childcare, and supports for fathers/partners o Transportation, language translation, housing assistance, job training, and prison/jail -based services Public Health Services o Immunization and health education (for example, smoking cessation, yout h pregnancy prevention, childbirth education, breastfeeding and nutrition) Provider and Community training o Continuing education and training on best practices for Healthy Start staff and community partners After a plateau between 2000 and 2005, the U.S. i nfant mortality rate declined approximately 21 percent overall between 200597and 202198 to a record low of 5.44 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. However, the non -Hispanic Black infant mortality rate is more than double that for non - Hispanic Whites.99,100 In 2021, the five leading causes of infant mortality in the U.S. included birth defects, preterm birth and low birthweight, sudden infant death syndrome, unintentional injuries, and maternal complications.101 Healthy Start works with women who are at high er risk for adverse perinatal health outcomes and with their families, to reduce disparities by providing and/or facilitating access to needed services to improve the health of mothers and children before, during, and after pregnancy, and through the first 18 months after birth. With the ongoing emphasis on including the partners of enrolled women, the program also actively recruits fathers and partners in education, activities, services, and events. Healthy Start grantees collaborate within local communities to build upon a community's existing resources to improve the quality of, and access to, health care and other supports. Every Healthy Start project has a Community Action Network (CAN) composed of neighborhood 97 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.

The CAN addresses fragmented service delivery and supports culturally and linguistically appropriate services. Grantees also collaborate with other local progr ams and at the federal and state levels. Some collaborations include: Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program Title V State Maternal and Child Health Block Grant Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (W IC) Early Head Start Medicaid Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Local community health centers that provide maternity care services These collaborations strengthen the services provided to Healthy Start families and help reduce risk factors, such as substance use during pregnancy, while promoting healthy behaviors that can lead to improved outcomes for women and their families. With the increase in funding provided in FY 2023, HRSA launched a new competition to support the Enhanced Healthy Start pilot program model in 10 new communities with the highest rates of perinatal health disparity in the country to reduce racial dispariti es in poor maternal and infant health outcomes. These recipients will continue to support individual physical, and behavioral client interventions while also addressing the unique structural, environmental, and systemic factors that contribute to dispariti es in poor outcomes for mothers and their babies. Grant recipients will engage a broader set of partners \u2014from sectors such as education, labor, public safety, and housing \u2014in order to address social determinants of maternal and infant health. HRSA supports the Healthy Start Technical Assistance (TA) Center to support program implementation through technical assistance, training, and education for grantees, including the FY 2023 Enhanced Healthy Start pilot grantees. Healthy Start TA Center services strength en staff skills to implement evidence -based practices in maternal and child health; facilitate grantee - to-grantee sharing of expertise and lessons learned from the field; and facilitate resource sharing for effective program delivery. The Healthy Start TA Center provided instrumental COVID -19- related training to Healthy Start grantees impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Healthy Start Program of $185.0 million is $40 million higher than the FY 2023 Enacted level. The FY 2024 funding request will also support a recompetition of the program to serve women and families across the Nation through approximately 101 new grants. Recognizing that improving birth outcomes begins with improving women's healt h before, during, and after pregnancy, funding will continue to improve access to quality health care and support services for women and children throughout the prenatal, postpartum, and inter - conception periods. Within this total, $15.0 million will conti nue to support grantees to hire clinical service providers at Healthy Start sites to provide direct access to well woman care and maternity care services. This will reduce barriers to care and better address health disparities 246 among high -risk and underserv ed women. This funding will also continue a $13.1 million Enhanced Healthy Start pilot funded in FY 2023 that supports up to 10 awards in new communities with the highest rates of perinatal health disparity in the country to address the unique structural, environmental, and systemic factors that contribute to disparities in poor outcomes for mothers and their babies. The Budget Request also includes $40 million within the Healthy Start Program to expand the scope of Healthy Start grants by investing in pr omising practices learned from the \"Benefits Bundle\" pilots initiated in FY 2023. This pilot is focused on most effectively and efficiently utilizing government resources by developing innovative, family -centered approaches to making enrollment in existin g public benefits easier for eligible low -income families, addressing social determinants of health (food insecurity, unstable housing, lack of transportation), and delivering culturally competent care. Healthy Start grantees will leverage this additional funding to implement these innovative Benefit Bundle pilot approaches for the clients and communities they serve. Healthy Start grantees will demonstrate improvement on defined Benefits Bundle measures, such as increased enrollment of underserved communiti es in existing safety net supports, increased multi -program enrollment, and improved mental health of parents. HRSA will collaborate with evaluation staff within the agency and at HHS, including HHS' Evaluation Officer in ASPE, to ensure evaluation and ev idence building are incorporated in this effort. This initiative follows the White House's commitment to improve the Federal Customer Experience by making service delivery of available benefits more efficient for women and families and ultimately improvin g infant and early childhood development outcomes. The funding request also includes costs associated with the Healthy Start Monitoring and Evaluation Data (HSMED) system as well as the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, inform ation technology, and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount FY Program Accomplishments In FY 2019, Healthy Start funded a new initiative to reduce maternal mortality by hiring clinical service providers (e.g., nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, behavioral health providers, and other maternal -child advanced practice health professionals) to provide clinical support, such as well -woman care and maternity care services, within program sites nationwide. In FYs 2019 through 2023, HRSA used $15 million per year to support these activities within ex isting Healthy Start awards. Available data show that by the end of 2021, nearly 200 clinicians were providing care at 92 grant sites through this funding. 247 In 2021, HRSA funded supplemental grants to help train, certify, and pay for community -based doula s in Healthy Start service areas. This funding increased the pool of available doulas in communities with higher rates of infant deaths and racial and ethnic differences in the health outcomes of infants and pregnant people. In FY 2021, the first opportuni ty supported 25 Healthy Start projects in 19 states. In 2022, HRSA announced the second funding opportunity for current Healthy Start sites to further grow, diversify, and sustain the community -based doula workforce. This funding will increase the total nu mber of Healthy Start doula programs from 25 to approximately 38 nationwide. Key program accomplishments highlighted below reflect FY 2021 outcomes among Healthy Start Program participants. This is the third year of data reporting for the cohort of grant ees initially funded in FY 2019. In FY 2021, the program exceeded two of the three performance measure targets: timely prenatal care utilization and number of participants served. The program did not meet the target for low birthweight infants, possibly re flecting the national increase in preterm birth rate in 2021 (the highest reported since 2007)102, as well as the program's focus on reaching the highest risk populations in communities with elevated rates of infant mortality and adverse perinatal outcomes. The Healthy Start Program served approximately 72,000 women and children in FY 2021, in addition to nearly 4,800 men. During the same period, Healthy Start projects screened 99 percent of women participants for depression, with 85 percent of those who s creened positive receiving referral for services (of the remainder, some have already been receiving ser vices or declined a referral) In addition, with the funding made available starting in FY 2019 to hire more clinical service providers as part of the initiative to reduce maternal mortality, 92 Healthy Start grantees have hired 198 new clinical providers. Between November 2019 and October 2021, these clinicians provided 29,644 in -person visits and nearly 15,000 telehealth visits, including well - woman care, prenatal care, postpartum care, and behavioral health counseling. The 2019 -2021 (three -year average) infant mortality rate ( IMR ) in the U.S. was 5.48 per 1,000 live births, and 7.17 per 1,000 live births for Healthy Start participants.103 The higher rates for Healthy Start participants likely reflects the high -risk populations that are targeted by the program. The current Healthy Start grantee cohort be gan in 2019 , as new grantees enter ed the 102 Hamilton BE, Martin JA, Osterman MJK. Births: Provisional data for 2021. Vital Statistics Rapid Release; no 20. Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics. May 2022. https://www.cd c.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr020.pdf 103 A multi -year infant mortality rate (IMR) is reported for 2019 -2021. This allows the Healthy Start Program to track infant mortality while taking into consideration that infant death is a rare event. When calculated with in small populations, such as the Healthy Start program population, IMRs can appear to change substantially if there is even a small difference in the number of deaths within a single year. Such changes may be due to normal variation and are not necessaril y caused by actual change in the underlying risk. The IMRs for the single years 2019 to 2021 are as follows: 2019: Healthy Start 8.05 per 1,000 live births, United States 5.58 per 1,000 live births 2020: Healthy Start 7.04 per 1,000 live births, United St ates 5.42 per 1,000 live births 2021: Healthy Start 6.67 per 1,000 live births, United States 5.44 per 1,000 live births Healthy Start Data Source: Healthy Start Aggregate Reporting Spreadsheet/Birth 2019, 248 program and some current grantees chang ed service areas to address areas of greater need. As noted in the table below, Healthy Start single -year IMRs have decreased with each successive year as grantees are able to better serve their participants. Table 1.0 Single Year Infant Mortality Rates in the U.S. and among Healthy Start Participants Year U.S. Single Year Infant Mortality Rates (per 1,000 live births) Healthy Start Single Year Infant Mortality Rates (per 1,000 live births) 2019 5.58 8.05 2020 5.42 7.04 2021 5.44 6.67 Healthy Start is committed to data -driven and evidence -based decision -making. In FY 2021, HRSA invested in a four -year contract to conduct a national evaluation of the Healthy Start program to determine the effectiveness of the program. The evaluation concludes in FY 2025, and results will be used to inform decision -making and develop recommendations to improve implementation of the Healthy Start program. These efforts continue to bu ild from evaluation work that began in 2017 when Healthy Start initiated a national evaluation that showed positive outcomes related to program goals.104 These include earlier and more frequent prenatal care visits, greater engagement in infant safe sleep practices, and lower rates of low birthweight deliveries. Healthy Start participants also met or exceeded targets with respect to usual source of care and depression screening. To address the impact of COVID -19 in Healthy Start communities, the Healthy St art Technical Assistance Center provided Beyond COVID -19- Webinar Series information sessions to grantees impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Topics covered include breastfeeding, reconnecting and reengaging clients, and mental health.

The program achieves this by su pporting state and local public health agencies to provide screening, counseling, and health care services . Approximately, four million newborns each year are screened for at least 31 of the 36 core conditions on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). This is a list of conditions recommended by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for state newborn screening (NBS) programs . Identifying and diagnosing babies with one of these conditions enables them to receive early intervention and treatment to prevent serious problems such as brain damage, organ damage, and even death. Newborn screening saves or improves the lives of nearly 13,000 babies in the United States each year. The Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children program began in 2000 and was reauthorized by the NBS Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2014. The authorization expired in 2019. The Heritable Disorders portfolio was recently redesigned based on results from a FY 2022 -2023 evaluation of the portfolio, and inpu t from a variety of stakeholders, experts, and families. The intention of the redesign is to better address current needs and increase efficiencies so that newborns with a heritable disorder get the services they need to thrive and become healthy adults. T he updated portfolio includes funding for state newborn screening programs so that states can directly improve processes and ensure that infants and their families receive timely information and services. The Heritable Disorders portfolio is composed o f the following programs: 251 The Newborn Screening Priorities Program (NBS Propel) which began in FY 2023 supports state NBS programs to address state -specific challenges; and enhances, improves, and expands state NBS systems through two focus areas. Focus ar ea 1 includes activities related to improving timely collection and reporting of NBS specimens and implementing screening for newly added RUSP conditions so that NBS -identified individuals with a heritable disorder may be diagnosed and treated early. Focus area 2 includes activities related to improving follow -up across the lifespan and helping families understand and navigate the process from confirmation of a diagnosis to treatment. Focus area 2 also supports activities to strengthen communication with fa milies of infants diagnosed with Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) and other NBS disorders, to ensure infants have access to specialty care and treatment, particularly in underserved populations, and that families are actively engaged at all levels of the newborn screening system. In FY 2024 this program also includes NBS Co -Propel, which supports organizations that directly work with states to improve state NBS systems. The National Center for Newborn Screening System Excellence (NBS Excel), awarded in FY 2023, supports a national organization to strengthen state public health agencies and NBS system partners to provide screening, counseling, or health care services to newborns and children with, or at risk for, heritable disorders. NBS Excel provide s leadership, technical assistance, and quality improvement expertise; collects data to identify barriers to achieving health equity and equitable access to NBS services for all infants and families; enhances state performance in NBS; and provides subject matter expertise, technical assistance, and training, education, and other resources to families and/or individuals with heritable disorders to promote engagement and partnership at all levels of the newborn screening system. The Newborn Screening Informa tion Center (NBSIC) is a clearinghouse of NBS information and serves as a central hub of educational resources, research, and data on NBS, as well as family support information. The NBSIC provides clear and up -to-date information, materials, and resources about NBS in the United States. These resources help increase awareness, knowledge, and understanding of NBS and genetic conditions. In FY 2020, after the authorization expired, the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Ch ildren was re -established as a discretionary committee. The charter was renewed in FY 2023. The Committee provides national NBS guidance and standards by making systematic evidence -informed and peer -reviewed recommendations regarding conditions for inclusi on on the RUSP. It also advises the Secretary on reducing mortality or morbidity from heritable disorders and considers ways to ensure state and jurisdiction capacity to screen for RUSP conditions. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children program of $20.9 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will continue support of the projects and associated awards that comprise the Heritable Disorders i n Newborns and Children program. This includes continued support of state and local public health agencies, public health professionals, and primary and specialty care providers in their ability to provide screening, counseling, and health care services to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by heritable 252 disorders in newborns and children. The program will continue to fund efforts to increase awareness, knowledge and understanding of NBS and enhance, improve, or expand access to screening, counseling, and health care services for newborns and children having or at risk for genetic disorders. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other progra m support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year In FY 2022, program accomplishments include supporting multiple states with implementing screening for the latest conditions added to the RUSP, a key program goal. Currently, 78% of state newborn screening programs are screening for Spinal Muscular Atrophy , which was added to the RUSP in 2018. Approximately, 60% of states and territories are screening for Pompe disease (added in 2015), X -linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (added in 2016), and Mucopolysaccharidosis Type 1 (added in 2016). The program has also sup ported many quality improvement activities. Nearly all participating states improved their time of collecting specimens from birthing facilities within 48 hours after birth and reporting results out within seven days of life. These benchmarks were set by t he Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children as a critical measure of the success of state NBS programs. In addition, the program funded dozens of toolkits, webinars, model practices, videos, policy statements, publications, educat ional tools, reports, data visualizations, and presentations. These are available for state NBS programs and the public. The NBSIC continues to serve as an important resource, with over 319,000 page views from September 2021 through October 2022. 253 Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result /Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 FY 2024 Target FY 2024 +/- 3070.01: Percentage of states that reported collecting 95% or more of specimens within 48 hours of birth (Output) FY 2020: 78% Target: Not Defined (Historical Actual) 79% 80% percentage point 3070.02: Percentage of states that reported 95% or more of all newborn screening results (normal and out -of- range) within seven days of birth (Output) FY 2020: 29% Target: Not Defined (Historical Actual) point Grant Awards 2023 Enacted FY 2024 President's Budget Awards 24 35 40 4 4 5 --- Authorizing Legislation...........Public Health Service Act, Section 330M, as amended by Public Law 117 -159, Section 11005 FY 2024 Authorization........................................................................$31,000,000 Allocation Method Competitive grant/ co -operative agreement Program Description The Pediatric Mental Health Care Access (PMHCA) Program promotes behavioral health integration in pediatric primary care by developing new, or expanding existing, statewide or regional pediatric mental health care telehealth access programs. These programs use telehealth to help pediatric primary care providers diagnose, treat, and refer children with behavioral health condi tions. PMHCA works to address the shortages of psychiatrists, developmental -behavioral pediatricians, and other behavioral health clinicians who can support children and adolescents with behavioral concerns. PMHCA is authorized through the Public Health Service Act, Section 330M, which was first established in 2018 through the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114 -255). The program was recently reauthorized through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (P.L. 117 -159). The National Survey of Children's Health found significant increases in the number of children diagnosed with mental health conditions between 2016 and 2020. During the study timeframe, the number of children ages 3 -17 years old diagnosed with anxiety grew by 29 percent and thos e with depression grew by 27 percent .109 Significant disparities exist in access to behavioral health care. Studies have generally found lower behavioral health service use among Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino children, compared with White children.110 Black/African American children residing in urban areas and Hispanic/Latino children residing in both rural and urban areas are less likely to be connected to mental health care than White children. White 108 FTEs in this table include FTEs provided by supplementary funds. 109 Lebrun -Harris, L. A., Ghandour, R. M., Kogan, M. D., & Warren, M. D. (2022). Five -Year Trends in US Children's Health and A.(2017) Improving Mental Health Access for Low -Income Children and Families in the Primary Care Setting. Pediatrics , 139 (1): e20151175. 10.1542/peds.2015 -1175 255 children in rural areas are significant ly less likely to receive mental health services than their counterparts in urban areas.111 Evidence suggests that practical barriers, bias, and discrimination play a central role in creating these disparities. Often, pediatric primary care providers are th e first responders in behavioral disorder identification and service provision. However, they may not have the knowledge, training, or resources to screen, diagnose, and treat behavioral disorders. Telehealth strategies, like the ones the PMHCA program sup ports, connect primary care providers with specialty mental and behavioral health care providers. This approach increases access to behavioral health services including for those living in rural and other underserved areas. Budget Request The FY 2024 Pre sident's Budget Request for the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access Program of $13 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. The request will continue to support at least 21 statewide or regional pediatric mental health care telehealth access programs funded through the FY 2023 competition. These programs will continue to provide tele -consultation, training, technical assistance, and care coordination support for pediatric primary care providers to diagnose, treat, and refer children with behavioral he alth conditions. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Accomplishments PMHCA program award recipients addressed increases in behavioral health issues among children and adolescents related to the COVID -19 pandemic, including increased reports of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation and attempts. Award recipients also su pported resilience strategies among families and clinicians. Across 21 states in FY 2021,112 the program achieved the following: Over 6,700 primary care providers enrolled in a statewide or regional PMHCA program. Over 2,000 providers used consultation and care coordination support services and over 6,400 providers were trained. 111 Hodgkinson, S., Godoy, L., Beers, L.S., Lewin , A.(2017) Improving Mental Health Access for Low -Income Children and Families in the Primary Care Setting.

This is accomplished by establishing, improving, and/or maintaining statewide, tribal, or regional114 networks that provide real -time psychiatric consultation, care coordination support services, and culturally and linguistically appro priate training to maternity care providers and clinical practices. This program is also intended to help reduce maternal health inequities. Maternal mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder, are common complicatio ns during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Across the country, there is a significant shortage of psychiatrists and mental health providers. Thus, it is important to train front -line providers to identify and treat behavioral health conditions as part of routine primary care so that pregnant and postpartum people affected by these conditions receive timely, appropriate care. The Screening and Treatment for Maternal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders program began in 2018 under the Public Health Service Act, Section 317L -1, as added by the 21st Century Cures Act, Section 10005 (P.L. 114 -255). In 2022, the program was reauthorized by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (P.L. 117 -328) and the program title was change d from \"Screening and Treatment for Maternal Depression and Related Behavioral Disorders.\" 114 Regional MMHSUD teams are defined as MMHSUD care teams within regions of a state, jurisdiction, or Tribal area 259 In FY 2023, the program was recompeted and expanded to support up to 17 awardees. The FY 2023 competition includes program modifications to reflect changes outline d in the recent reauthorization. The program will: Require grant recipients to provide a 10 percent match to support program activities. Expand eligible entities to include Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations, in addition to States. Give priority, as ap propriate, to entities that: 1) focus on enhancing screening, prevention and treatment; 2) partner with community -based organizations that address maternal mental health and substance use disorders; 3) are located in, or provide services to, areas with dis proportionately high rates of maternal mental health or substance use disorders, or other related disparities; and 4) operate in a health professional shortage area. The program's long -term goals are to: Increase routine mental and behavioral health scree ning for pregnant and postpartum persons; Increase routine detection, assessment, treatment, and referral of maternal mental health conditions using evidence -based practices; and, Increase access to treatment and recovery support services for pregnant and postpartum persons that are affordable, culturally and linguistically appropriate, community -based, and provided via telehealth and traditional in -person services. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Screening and Treatment for Maternal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders program of $10 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request continues previous investments as part of the Improving Maternal Health Initiative to expand support for the Screening and Treatme nt for Maternal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders program to increase access for perinatal women to behavioral health care. This effort supports use of consultation (teleconsultation or in -person) and care coordination support, and training to expa nd front -line health care provider capacity to screen, assess, treat, and refer women who are pregnant, postpartum, or have given birth within the past 12 months for maternal mental health and substance use disorders. This funding will support efforts to address ongoing and growing maternal mental health needs. Funding will also be used to support a joint MCH Tele -behavioral Health Programs Technical Assistance Innovation Center with the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access program, as well as Evaluation S upport for State Behavioral Health Telehealth programs. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. 260 Funding Histor y Fiscal Year Awardees 782 providers in FY 2021, a decrease from 1,085 providers trained in FY 2020.115 Trainings covered a variety of evidence -based practices such as: Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT); Medication Assisted Treatment; how to use standardized validated screening tools for perinata l depression and anxiety; ways to integrate behavioral health in primary care settings; and training on perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. Providers trained include obstetricians/gynecologists, psychiatrists, licensed clinical social workers, licensed p rofessional counselors, nurses/nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, care coordinators/patient navigators, family medicine physicians, and other health professionals. Consultation116 Providers sought/received expert consultation for 18,066117 pregnant and postpartum women in FY 2021, of whom 77% lived in rural/underserved areas. This was an increase from 7,448 pregnant and postpartum women in FY 2020, of whom 47% lived in rural/underserved areas. Screening118 The number of pregnant and postpartum women screened for depression by participating providers increased from 24,518 in FY 2020 to 37,764 in FY 2021 The number of pregnant and postpartum women screened for anxiety by participating providers increased from 14,978 in FY 2020 to 31,096 in FY 2021 The number of pregnant and postpartum women screened for substance use by participating providers increased from 12,928 in FY 2020 to 21,485 in FY 2021 115 The decrease in the number of providers attending training is due to: 1) the toll of the COVID pandemic on provider capacity and time to attend trainings, and; 2) changes in the way states offered training resources (i.e. recorded trainings available onli ne that do not require registration or track participants versus interactive, in -person trainings with registered participants). 116 \"Consultation\" refers to psychiatric consultation and/or care coordination support provided either via telehealth or in-perso n by the program. 117 The FY21 result is likely an overestimate, as some awardees report the total caseloads of enrolled providers instead of the number of pregnant and postpartum women for whom a provider sought consultation. The program is moving towards a more consistent approach to reporting for this information. 118 The increases in the numbers screened are due to more complete reporting and increased engagement with providers to report screening within their practices. 261 Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result /Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY 2023 pregnant or postpartum women about whom a provider contacted the Maternal Depression and Related Behavioral Disorders Program for consultation or referral (Output) FY 2021: 18,066 Target: Not Defined (Historical Actual) Not Defined 7,500 N/A 3090.03: Number of providers utilizing the Maternal Depression and Related Behavioral Disorders Program for consultation (teleconsultation or in -person) and care coordination support services for treatment and referral of pregnant and postpartum women with behavioral health conditions (Output) FY 2021: 584 Target: Not Defined (Historical Actual) Not Defined 600 N/A 3090.04: Number of providers trained through the Maternal Depression and Related Behavioral Disorders Program to better screen, diagnose, treat, and refer pregnant and postpartum women with behavioral health conditions (Output) FY 2021: 782 Target: Not Defined (Historical Actual) Not Defined 800 N/A 262 Measure Year and Most Recent Result /Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY 2023 Depression number (percent); Anxiety number (32%) Target: Not Defined (Historical Actual) Discontinued Discontinued N/A Performance Narrative Measure 3090.01 reflects use of provider consultation as a major component of the Screening and Treatment for Maternal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders program. Previous targets not established. The FY 2021 result is likely an overestimate, as so me awardees report the total caseloads of enrolled providers instead of the number of pregnant and postpartum women for whom a provider sought consultation. The program is moving towards a more consistent approach to reporting for this information. Given these factors, we have set a target for FY 2024 that is more in line with prior results. Measures 3090.03 and 3090.04 are new measures in the FY 2024 Congressional Justification. Previous targets not established. HRSA identified trends over a three -year 263 period using data from awardee reports to set appropriate targets for the FY 2024 Congressional Justification. Measure 3090.03 represents the unduplicated count of providers who contacted the program for consultation & care coordination support, which is a b etter indication of program reach. The program was reauthorized by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (P.L. 117-328) and the program title was changed to \"Screening and Treatment for Maternal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders.\" Program mea sure titles will reflect this new program name in the next Congressional Justification. Grant Awards Table FY 2022 Final FY 2023 Enacted FY 2024 President's Budget Awards 7 17 17 3 3 --- Authorizing Legislation: Sections 1271 -1274 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Public Law 116 -94, Division N, Title I, Subtitle D, Section 403 Authorization Program Description The Poison Control Program (PCP) is legislatively mandated to establish and maintain a national toll-free number to ensure access to poison control services; implement a national media campaign to educate and support outreach to the public and health care providers; and support poison control centers (PCCs) to help p revent poisonings, provide recommendations for managing poisonings, and comply with accreditation requirements. The PCP was established in 2000 by the Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act (P.L. 106 -174) and has since been reauthorized as p art of the Public Health Service Act, Title XII, Section 1271 -1274, most recently by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 (P.L. 116 -94). The program helps ensure that individuals can call a national toll -free Poison Help line from anywhere in the United States and the territories and connect to the PCC that serves their respective areas. The PCP maintains the toll -free Poison Help Line (800-222-1222) , provides interpretation services in over 161 languages, and offers services for the hearin g impaired. Through the PCCs, individuals have access to health care providers and other specially trained toxicology experts twenty -four hours a day, seven days a week who provide assessments, triage, and treatment recommendations at no cost to callers a cross the U.S., including American Samoa, the District of Columbia, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. PCCs are consulted for a range of exposures including, for example, when a child swallows a household pr oduct; an adolescent intentionally ingests an over -the-counter medication; a worker is exposed to harmful substances; or a senior takes an additional dose of a prescribed medication. Emergency 911 operators refer poison -related calls to PCCs, and 265 emergency and in -patient health care professionals regularly consult PCCs for expert consultation in managing poisonings. The PCCs also conduct follow -up calls to monitor case progress and document medical outcomes. PCCs are also critically important partners in emergency and disaster preparedness. Additionally, the PCP supports a national Poison Help media campaign to educate the public and health care providers about poison and toxic exposure prevention, share the availability of poison control resources in local communities, and to advertise the nationwide toll -free number. Activities include partnering with health departments, education departments, and other state agencies; promoting safe prescription medication use and storage; messaging in l ocal news sources and at community events; and collaborating to develop media campaigns focused on preventing poisonings. PCCs are actively engaged in National Poison Prevention Week, which is dedicated to raising awareness about poisoning risks, PCCs, and the Poison Help line. PCCs also participate in National Prescription Drug Take -Back events to provide a safe, convenient, and responsible means of prescription drug disposal. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Poison Control program of $2 6.8 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will provide grants to the 52 PCCs. These grants provide a small base of support to each PCC, contributing on average 13 percent to each PCC's overall budget that is needed to maintain infrast ructure and core triage and treatment services. While PCCs have innovatively secured funding from a variety of local sources, including philanthropic organizations, their financial stability is tenuous. The FY 2024 Budget Request will also continue to s upport interpretation services for non - English speaking callers and maintenance of the national toll -free Poison Help line, which is currently based on a 2010 model with legacy infrastructure that does not allow for updates such as geolocation and texting. The nationwide media campaign will continue to educate the public and health care providers about poisoning and toxic exposure prevention, the availability of the national toll -free number, and local PCC services. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount PCCs managed 2.85 million encounters.119 The number of human exposure poisonings remained essentially level at 2.1 million. Despite significant decreases in overall information requests (down 37 percent), medication identification requests (down 21 percent), and medical information requests (dow n 61 percent) compared to 2020, the first year of the COVID -19 pandemic, these requests were still 13 -fold higher than before the pandemic. In 2021, drug information requests increased 146 percent compared with 2020, related in part to COVID -19 vaccines. C alls from health care facilities increased 7 percent compared to 2020, accounting for 24 percent of all human exposure cases in 2021. The majority of calls, 69 percent, originated from residences and were managed by the PCC without requiring emergency medi cal attention. Access to around -the-clock professional guidance from PCCs decreases unnecessary visits to emergency departments and underscores the PCCs' role as easily accessible and trusted sources of public health information. In FY 2021, the national Poison Help media campaign helped educate the public about poisoning risks, the accessibility of the toll -free number, and PCC services by supporting public service announcements that garnered over 76 million impressions through more than 12,000 airings on nearly 250 television and radio stations in over 100 markets.

Staffed by family members of CYSHCN with first -hand experience navi gating health care and other needed services and supports for their children, F2F HICs also advise health care professionals on developing more effective partnerships with families. The program aims to empower families to be active participants and decisio n-makers in choosing and paying for their children's care. F2F HIC support and services include: Guidance on building productive relationships between families and health professionals Training and guidance for health professionals on caring for CYSHCN Promoting F2F HIC services and resources to families, health professionals, schools, etc. Engaging families of CYSHCN and health professionals as staff and leaders for these programs When it was initially authorized by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the program funded one F2F HIC in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Since then, HRSA expanded F2F HICs to all jurisdictions and to Indian tribes . Most recently, the Sustaining Excellence in Medicaid Act of 2019 (P.L. 116 -39) reauthorized the program through FY 2024. 270 Research supports the effectiveness of the F2F HIC strategy.121 Evidence shows CYSHCN experience improved health outcomes and cost -savings when families are empowered to make informed choices about their care and partner with health professional s.122 Outcomes include: Improved transition from pediatric to adult health care systems; Fewer unmet health needs; Better community -based systems ; Fewer problems with specialty referrals; Lowered out -of-pocket costs; Improved physical and behavioral health; and Increased access to preventive health care in a medical home. Budget Request The F2F HIC program is funded at $6.0 million for each fiscal year through FY 2024.123 In FY 2024, F2F HICs will be reduced by $342,000 through sequestration pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA). This request will support 59 F2F HIC grants. The FY 2024 funding will help ens ure continued delivery of patient -centered information, education, technical assistance, and peer support to families of CYSHCN. The F2F HICs will continue to address health equity through targeted outreach and leadership development to specific underrep resented populations, such as populations living in rural or urban areas, those with limited English proficiency, and those that reflect other demographic factors such as ethnicity, disability, gender, sexual orientation, family structure and socioeconomic status. F2F HICs also continue to develop partnerships with organizations serving diverse families. The F2F HICs will continue to address the long -term impact of COVID -19 by providing education to families on COVID -19, accessing telehealth services, and the importance of vaccinations. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

FY 2022 awardee survey data reveal that ninety -six percent of families reported that the information they received from an F2F HIC met their needs and ninety - nine percent reported they would recommen d F2F HIC services to another family. Eighty -eight percent of families reported that the information or services received from F2F HICs helped prepare them to work with those who serve their children. Additionally, FY 2021 grantee data show F2F HICs train ed and provided information, resources, and referrals to 103,675 health professionals who serve CYSHCN and their families within community and state public health agencies, managed care and insurance organizations, medical practices, children's hospitals, universities, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and more. FY 2022 awardee survey data show ninety -seven percent of professionals served by an F2F HIC reported they were satisfied with the information and ninety -six percent would recommend F2F HIC servic es to families or other professionals. Ninety -eight percent of professionals reported the information or services received from F2F HICs helped prepare them to work better with families and/or others who serve CSHCN. To address health equity, an objective of the F2F HIC program is to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented and diverse communities trained to partner with families at all levels of decision making. F2F HICs participated in community forums and town halls led by the national f amily -led organization, Family Voices, to address the impact of racism on CYSHCN and their families.

The MIECHV Program has been in existence since 2010, and builds upon decades of scientific research showing that home visits by a nurse, social worker, early childhood educator, or other trained professional during pregnancy, and in the first years of life have the potential to improve the lives of children and families by: Helping to prevent child abuse and ne glect; Encouraging positive parenting; Improving maternal and child health; and Promoting child development and school readiness. By providing necessary resources and supports, home visiting empowers families. Evidence - based home visiting can be cost-effective in the long term, with the largest benefits coming through reduced spending on government programs and increased individual earnings.127 State and jurisdiction grantees conduct statewide needs assessments to identify eligible at -risk communities, determine priority populations, and choose one or more of the 22 approved 126 FY 2022 and FY 2024 reflect the post -sequestration funding amount. 127 Michalopoulos, C, et. al.

Available at: https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED579153.pdf . 275 evidence -based home visiting models or identify promising approaches tha t will best meet the specific needs of their states and communities. As part of all MIECHV programs, trained home visiting professionals meet regularly with expectant parents or families with young children in their homes to build strong, positive relation ships. Home visitors work with families to provide services tailored to their needs, such as: Teaching parenting skills and modeling effective parenting techniques. Creating a language -rich environment that stimulates early language development. Advising on topics such as breastfeeding, safe sleep, injury prevention, and nutrition. Screening and providing referrals to address caregiver depression, substance abuse, and family violence. Screening children for developmental delays and facilitating early diag nosis and intervention for autism and other developmental disabilities. HRSA distributes MIECHV funds through base and matching grants to states, jurisdictions, and nonprofit organizations and competitive cooperative agreements to Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations. Statute sets aside funds for other purposes, such as technical assistance, workforce supports, including the Jackie Walorski Center for Evidence - Based Case Management, and research, evaluation, and federal admin istration. Base Grants: In FY 2022, HRSA awarded $336 million in MIECHV formula grants to 56 states, jurisdictions, and nonprofit organizations. Grants are generally administered by the lead state agency for home visiting designated by the Governor, or th ey can be competitively awarded to a nonprofit organization in those states or jurisdictions that opted not to participate in the grant program. By law, state and jurisdictional grantees must spend the majority of their MIECHV funds to implement evidence -based home visiting models, with up to 25 percent of funding available to implement promising approaches that undergo rigorous evaluation. Tribal Awards: Beginning in FY 2023, six percent of total MIECHV funding is reserved for grants to Indian tribes, tri bal organizations, and urban Indian organizations; in earlier fiscal years, three percent of funding was reserved. As of FY 2022, 36 tribal entities have received funding through the Tribal Home Visiting Program, administered by the Administration for Chil dren and Families. There are currently 30 grant recipients in 16 states. The program: o Develops and strengthens tribal capacity to support and promote the health and well-being of American Indian and Alaska Native families through home visiting programs; o Expands the evidence base around home visiting in tribal communities; and o Supports and strengthens cooperation and linkages between programs that serve Native children and their families. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117 -2) (ARP) appropriated $150 million to enable MIECHV state, jurisdiction, and Tribal grantees to support emergency needs of children and families affected by the COVID -19 pandemic. Examples include: Providing emergency supplies, including groceries, diapers, and oth er supplies. Training home visitors, including to identify and address families' mental health needs. 276 Funding home visitor hazard pay or other staff costs, including overtime for home visitors to reach families unable to participate in home visiting during regular work hours. Advancing data and technology innovations. Budget Request The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program is funded at $518.7 million128 in FY 2024, and funding will increase incrementally up to $800 million in FY 2027. Funding will continue to support the state, jurisdictional, and tribal administration of locally -run, voluntary, evidence -based home visiting services that have been proven to help prevent child abuse and neglect, encourage positive parenting, an d promote child development and school readiness. This level of funding will provide : Awards to 54 state and territory grantees and two non -profit organizations. Awards to approximately 45 tribal entities. Technical assistance for state, jurisdictional, and tribal MIECHV grantees. Workforce support, retention, and case management, including workforce -related technical assistance and the establishment and operation of the Jackie Walorski Center for Evidence -Based Case Management. Support fo r research, evaluation, and federal administration. Table 1. Mandatory Funding (FY 2023 - FY $800,000,000 $3,100,000,000 The increase in funds will expand the capacity of MIECHV grantees to reach more communities and families. Currently, MIECHV -funded programs serve over 69,000 families, reaching approximately 15% of the more than 465,000 families who are likely currently eligible and in need of MIECHV services.130 Over 5 years, funding increases will allow MIECHV -funded programs to provide comprehensive, coordinated home visiting services to additional communities and families through targe ted evidence -based home visiting. The increased appropriations may be used to maintain service expansion supported by the American Rescue Plan Act funding to ensure families are able to continue accessing services. Funds will also support the technology necessary for virtual service delivery as an option for families, as well as the recruitment and retention of the home visiting workforce, including increasing home visitor supports, and training and hiring a diverse workforce. States and jurisdictions may also begin to plan for expansion of services to additional communities and families by improving community capacity to initiate services and expanding the infrastructure 128 FY 2024 current law mandato ry funding is subject to sequestration. 129 Appropriation as provided through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Public Law 117 -328, Section 6101). However, FY24 post -sequestration amount is $518.7 million. 130 HRSA internal analysis using 2019 Current Population Survey data . 277 to support home visiting service delivery. Additionally, up to 18 new awards will be made to tribal entities to expand services to additional tribal communities. Funds will continue to support a portfolio of research and evaluation on home visiting, technical assistance to ensure families have access to quality evidence -based and promising home visiting service delivery models, and workforce supports to ensure a we ll-trained and stable workforce. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount131 Supplemental Funding Program Accomplishments MIECHV state and jurisdictional grantees provided over 8.8 million visits from FY 2012 through FY 2022. In FY 2022, states reported serving more than 137,000 parents and children in over 1,000 counties across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 5 territories. This is more than a 300 percent increase in the number of participants served since FY 2012 (see Table 1 below). Tribal grantees provided over 161,300 home visits from FY 2012 to FY 2022 and served more than 3,500 parents and children in FY 20 22. Table 1: Number of State/Jurisdictional Participants and Home Visits (FY 2012 - FY 2022)133 Fiscal Year Number of Participants of Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117 -2) 133 Data in Table 1 represent the number of participants and home visits provided by state and jurisdictional grantees (does not include tribal data). 278 Fiscal Year Number of Participants Number of living in at -risk communities. In FY 2022: 67 percent of participating families had household incomes at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty guidelines140 ($27,750 for a family of four), and 40 percent were at or below 50 percent of those guidelines. 23 percent of adult program participants had less than a high school education, and 38 percent had only a high school degree or equivalent. 9 percent of households included pregnant teens; 19 percent of households reported a history of child abuse and maltreatment; and 13 percent of households repor ted substance abuse. In FY 2020, all state and jurisdictional grantees showed performance improvement in at least four of the six MIECHV benchmark areas outlined in statute:141 Improving maternal and newborn health. Preventing child injuries, maltreatment , and emergency department visits. Improving school readiness and achievement. Reducing crime or domestic violence. Improving family economic self -sufficiency. Improving service coordination and referrals for other community resources and supports. 134 Reflects changes HRSA made to reporting definitions beginning in FY 2017 clarifying that only participa nts whose services were directly supported with federal funds should be included in MIECHV reports. 135 Does not include data from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands due to reporting delays caused by Hurricanes Maria and Irma. 136 Does not include data f rom the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands due to reporting delays caused by Super Typhoon Yutu. 137 FY 2020 results were impacted by funding cuts due to sequestration, the impacts of COVID -19 on enrollment and service delivery, and a reporting err or in one state. 138 FY 2021 results were impacted by funding cuts due to sequestration and the impacts of COVID -19 on enrollment and service delivery. 139 FY 2022 results were impacted by funding cuts due to sequestration, the impacts of COVID -19 on enrollmen t and service delivery, and significant issues with workforce recruitment and retention across the early childhood care and education field. 140 The HHS Poverty Guidelines are updated annually in February and published in the Federal Register.

Nearly sixty percent of RWHAP clients (patients) live at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level and ne arly three -quarters of clients are from racial and ethnic minority populations.145 The RWHAP statute requires that the program is the \"payor of last resort,\" meaning RWHAP funds can only be used for allowable services not covered by other federal146 or state programs, or private insurance. Since 1990, the RWHAP has developed a comprehensive system of safety net providers who deliver high quality direct health care and support services to over half a million people with HIV - more than half of all peo ple with diagnosed HIV in the United States.147 This is one of the many reasons why the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is leading key components of the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative . Working within the parameters of the RWHAP statute, funding priorities are guided by stakeholders at local and state levels, resulting in uniquely structured programs that address their jurisdictions' critical gaps and needs. HRSA also works in partnership with RWHAP recipients at state and local levels to use innovative, evidence info rmed approaches for community engagement, needs assessment, planning processes, policy development, service delivery, clinical quality improvement, and workforce development activities that are needed to support a robust system of HIV care, support, and tr eatment. The RWHAP provides HIV care and treatment services to a higher proportion of certain populations with HIV than their representation in the epidemic nationally. The RWHAP is critical to ensuring that individuals with HIV are linked to care, ret ained in care, able to adhere to medication regimens, and ultimately, achieve viral suppression. These steps are not only crucial to ensuring optimal health outcomes of people with HIV but to preventing further transmission of the virus,148 which furthers t he public health goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the United States.149 An overwhelming body of clinical evidence has firmly established that a person with HIV who is on treatment and has an undetectable viral load cannot sexually transmit HIV. This is r eferred to as Undetectable Equals Untransmittable, or U=U. 145 Published December 2022. Health Resources and Services Administration.

Due to the impact of the MPx public health emergency on the populations to which the RWHAP provides HIV care and treatment, HRSA has engaged in providing testing, treatment, and vaccines as part of the fed eral government response to MPx . Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. The Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative aims to reduce new HIV infections to less than 3,000 per year by 2030. The multi -year EHE initiative initially focuses on 48 counties, Washington, D.C., and San Juan (PR), which account for more than half of new HIV diagnoses, as well as 7 states that have a substantial rural HIV burden. The initiative will continue to bring the additional expertise, technology, and resources needed to end the HIV epidemic in the United States. EHE recipients made significant progress toward implementing their EHE initiativ e activities, despite challenges posed by the COVID -19 pandemic, including developing service delivery infrastructure, engaging with community members and new partners, and delivering services to clients. The RWHAP's comprehensive system of HIV care and support services and effective system for medication delivery creates a very efficient and effective service delivery mechanism for this initiative. Additional Collaborative Efforts In FY 2024, the RWHAP will continue to ensure effective use of resources and a coordinated and focused public health response to HIV. The RWHAP will also continue to coordinate and collaborate with other federal, state, and local entities as well as external HIV organizations to further leverage and promote efforts to address t he unmet care and treatment needs of people with HIV who are uninsured and underserved. These efforts help to align priorities, policies, and activities in sustaining a multi -faceted and comprehensive federal response to the HIV epidemic. Federal partners include the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Substance use And Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Administr ation for Community Living (ACL), the Indian Health Service (IHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as the HRSA -funded Health Center Program . The RWHAP has developed a coordinated implementation response that outlines the specific actions that the agency will take to achieve the goals and objectives that are outlined in National HIV/AIDS Strategy and accelerate our efforts toward ending the HIV epidemic.150 The Strategy builds on the targets for the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States initiative by 2030 and reflects the Administration's commitment to re-energize and strengthen a whole -of-society response to the epidemic while supporting people with HIV and reducing HIV -associated morbidity and mortality. 150 The White House. 2021. Nat ional HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States 2022 -2025. Washington, DC. 285 The RWHAP will also coordinate with federal partners, grant recipients, and other partners to address the syndemics (epidemics that closely interact with each other) of HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, and substance use disorders through the following HHS efforts: Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) National Strategic Plan for the United States: A Roadmap to Elimination 2021 -2025: The STI plan will develop, enhance, and expand STI prevention and care programs through 2025, with the aim of reversing the dramatic rise in STIs in the United States. Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan for the United States: A Roadmap to Elimination 2021 -2025: The Viral Hepatitis Plan is intended to serve as a comprehensive, data -driven roadmap for federal and other stakeholders to reverse the rates of viral hepati tis, prevent new infections, improve care and treatment, and ultimately eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat in the United States. Behavioral Health : In alignment with HHS's Strategy to advance behavioral health care in the most underserve d and rural communities, HRSA will continue to work collaboratively with other federal partners to address opioid use disorder screening, treatment and support for people with HIV. HHS Office of Infectious Disease Policy Syndemic Steering Committee: This committee will identify cross -agency policy and programmatic opportunities and collaborative approaches to address challenges, including gaps at the federal and jurisdictional levels; develop cross -departmental/agency policies, programs, or initiatives tha t capitalize on opportunities and address challenges; and apply a syndemic approach and focus on reducing disparities. CDC and HRSA are collaborating to help encourage the delivery of status neutral services to provide comprehensive care for all people, re gardless of HIV status at the jurisdictional level to most efficiently and effectively address disparities, address social determinants of health, and reduce HIV stigma . CDC/HRSA Advisory Committee on HIV, Viral Hepatitis and STD Prevention and Treatment (CHAC): HRSA will continue to partner with CDC to convene the CHAC which advises the Secretary of HHS in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, on objectives, strategies, policies, and priorities for HIV, viral hepatitis, and STD prevention and treatment efforts for the nation Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness151: HRSA, HUD, and the CDC are collaborating to examine opportunities and barrier s for enhancing access to HUD - assisted housing for people with HIV and impacted communities, with particular emphasis on the priority populations identified in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. HRSA and HUD will continue to work closely together, cross -training staff and recipients, informing RWHAP technical assistance and the RWHAP SPNS housing - related initiative. 151 Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness 286 Leveraging Collaboration between the RWHAP and Aging Agencies: Enhancing Support Services for Older Adults with HIV: Aging with HIV is an impo rtant topic for the RWHAP; approximately half of people served by the program are 50 years and older. HRSA and the Administration for Community Living have continued to collaborate and share information to improve the assessment of psychosocial needs and t he delivery of health care for older adults with HIV so that they may age with dignity and independence and have access to a broad array of services. Health and other concerns change as people with HIV grow older, requiring different approaches and service s from health care and social services providers. In FY 2022, HRSA launched the Emerging Strategies to Improve Health Outcomes for People Aging with HIV initiative to conduct the following activities: o Implement emerging strategies that comprehensively sc reen and manage comorbidities, geriatric conditions, behavioral health, and psychosocial needs of people 50 years and older with HIV o Assess the uptake and integration of emerging strategies o Research and assess implementation processes, including assessing specific implementation strategies o Research and assess broader contextual factors affecting implementation o Evaluate the impact of the emerging strategies o Document and disseminate the emerg ing strategies 287 RWHAP Part A - Emergency Relief Grants FY 2022 $54,105,000 $54,105,000 $54,105,000 --- FTE 42 48 48 --- Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Section 2601, as amended by Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009, Public Law 111 -87. FY 2024 Authorization...............................................................................Expired Allocation Method: Formula Grants Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreements Contracts Program Description The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part A provides grants to cities with a population of at least 50,000, which are areas severely affected by the HIV epidemic. These jurisdictions are funded as either an Eligible Metropolitan Area (EMA) or a Transitional Grant Area (TGA), depending on the severity of the epidemic in their jurisd iction. Nearly 71 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV reside in a RWHAP Part A EMA or TGA. 152,153 The RWHAP requires EMAs and TGAs to utilize local needs assessments and planning processes to develop coordinated systems of HIV care to improve health outcomes for low - income people with HIV, thereby reducing transmission of HIV. These grants assist eligible areas in developing and enhancing access to a comprehensive continuum of high quality, community -based care for low -income people with HIV, and mo re broadly support the HHS goals to protect and strength equitable access to high quality and affordable healthcare. RWHAP Part A prioritizes primary medical care, access to antiretroviral treatment, and other core medical and supportive services to eng age and retain people with HIV in care. These grants fund systems of care to provide services for people with HIV in 24 EMAs and 28 TGAs. EMAs are jurisdictions with 2,000 or more AIDS cases over the last five years as reported to the 152 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Two -thirds of the funds available for EMAs and TGAs are awarde d according to a formula, based on the number of people with diagnosed HIV in the EMAs and TGAs. The remaining funds are awarded as discretionary supplemental grants based on the demonstration of additional need by the eligible EMAs and TGAs, and as Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) grants. The MAI funds are a statutory set -aside to evaluate and address the disproportionate impact of HIV on, and the disparities in access, treatment, care, and outcomes for, racial and ethnic minorities . MAI funds are also awarded based on a formula utilizing the number of minorities with diagnosed HIV and AIDS in a jurisdiction and support HIV care, treatment, and support services. Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. - RWHAP Part A Jurisdictions Thirty -nine of the RWHAP Part A jurisdictions received a cooperative agreement to implement Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative activities related to Pillar Two (Treat) and Pillar Four (Respond) in FY 2022 . This initiative is now in its fourth year and j urisdictions will utili ze their existing infrastructure to implement effective and innovative strategies, interventions, approaches, and services to reduce new HIV infections in the United States. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part A of $680.7 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. These requested funding levels will support the provision of core medical and support services for people with HIV in the 24 EMAs and 28 TGAs. RWHAP Part A jurisdictions are experienced in data -driven, community -based needs assessment, responsive procurement of a variety of direct medical and supportive services, working across service providers to develop and maintain a sy stem of services, and serving diverse populations. Approximately 65 percent of all RWHAP clients are served by one of the 52 cities funded under the RWHAP Part A154. Nearly 71 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV reside within these metropolitan areas. The RWHAP serves populations that have multiple structural barriers to care (e.g., people with HIV at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level and/or those who are homeless). Part A funding contributes to achieving the FY 2024 targets for perfo rmance goals that relate to cross -cutting activities, such as the total clients served and percentage of clients (total and minority clients) who achieved viral suppression . The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and awa rd process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs. 154 Data as of FY 2021. 289 RWHAP Part A Funding Accomplishments The RWHAP Part A has contributed to the tremendous progress the RWHAP has made toward ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. In 2021 alone, RWHAP Part A funded sites provided nearly 3.2 million core medical service visits for health -related care utilizing a combination of RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D funding. From 2010 to 2021, HIV viral suppression among RWHAP patients has increased from 69.5 percent to 89.7 percent, and racial and ethnic, age -based, and regional disparities have decreased.156 However, e ven with these positive outcomes, fully addressin g the HIV epidemic domestically continues to be a challenge as the CDC estimates that 1.2 million people in the United States have HIV, and 1 in 8 are unaware of their HIV.157 In addition, over 36,000 HIV diagnoses occur e very year.158 Research studies demonstrate that people with HIV who take HIV medications and get and keep an undetectable viral load, will not transmit HIV to their sex partner.159,160 Not only do improved viral suppression rates reduce the transmission of HIV, but they also resu lt in significant cost - savings to the health care system.161 In the RWHAP, 89.7 percent of patients receiving RWHAP 155 EHE funding is not included in this table. 156 Health Resources and Services Administration.

RWHAP Part B grants directly support the HHS goal to protect and strengthen equitable access to high quality and affordable healthcare, including efforts to reduce costs and ensure access to medications. These grants support outpatient ambulatory medical care, HIV -related prescription medications, case management, oral health care, health insurance premium and cost -sharing assistance, mental health and substance abuse services, and support services. RWHAP Part B funds are dis tributed through base and supplemental grants, AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) base and ADAP supplemental grants, Emerging Communities (ECs) grants, and Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) grants . The base awards are distributed by a formula based on a stat e or territory's prevalent HIV cases weighted for cases outside of the jurisdictions that receive RWHAP Part A funding. The ECs are metropolitan areas that do not qualify as RWHAP Part A EMAs or TGAs but have 500 -999 cumulative reported AIDS cases over the last five years. States apply on behalf of the ECs for funding through the RWHAP Part B base grant application. RWHAP Part B supplemental grants are available through a competitive process to eligible states with demonstrated need. A portion of the RWH AP Part B appropriation supports ADAPs, state or jurisdiction operated programs which support the provision of HIV medications and related services, including health insurance premium and cost -sharing assistance. These funds are distributed by a formula ba sed on prevalent HIV cases. In addition, ADAP supplemental funds are a five percent set aside for 294 states with severe need. ADAPs provide FDA -approved prescription medications for people with HIV who cannot afford HIV medications and are instrumental in eff orts to end the HIV epidemic across the nation. Recent studies have demonstrated that individuals with HIV on antiretroviral medications who achieve viral suppression are not at risk to transmit HIV to others. ADAP provides the access to medications and i nsurance necessary for people with HIV to achieve optimal health outcomes and viral suppression. Individual ADAPs operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northe rn Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The MAI funds are a statutory set -aside to evaluate and address the disproportionate impact of HIV on, and the disparities in access , treatment, care, and outcomes for, racial and ethnic minorities. The RWHAP Part B MAI funding is statutorily required to specifically support education and outreach services to increase the number of eligible racial and ethnic minorities who have access to the RWHAP ADAP. Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. - States Seven RWHAP Part B recipients with a substantial rural burden of new HIV diagnoses and the state of Ohio (on behalf of Hamilton County, which is currently not part of an EMA/TGA), received a cooperative agreement to implement Ending HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative activities related to Pillar Two (Treat) and Pillar Four (Respond) in FY 2022 . Jurisdictions will continue to utilize their existing infrastructure to implement effective an d innovative strategies, interventions, approaches, and services to reduce new HIV infections in the United States. AIDS Drug Assistance Program The RWHAP Part B has been successful in helping to ensure that people with HIV have access to the care and treatment services they need to live longer, healthier lives. According to the RWHAP ADAP Report, which is comprised of data reported by recipients a nnually in order to evaluate the national impact of ADAP through client -level data on individuals being served, services being delivered, and costs associated with these services, ADAPs continue to provide robust formularies of antiretroviral medications t o treat HIV infection, prevent and treat opportunistic infections, manage side effects, and treat co -morbidities.166 Across the RWHAP, grant recipients are encouraged to maximize resources and leverage efficiencies. Increased demand for RWHAP ADAP service s has led States to implement cost - containment strategies for their ADAPs, including by coordinating benefits with Medicare Part D and improving drug -purchasing models, which result in effective fund s management, enabling ADAPs to serve more people. In 202 0, ADAPs participating in cost -savings strategies on medications saved $2.5 billion. Over the last 5 years, ADAPs participating in medication cost - savings strategies saved $9.4 billion. With no individuals on the ADAP waiting lists since 2015, states req uested and HRSA distributed $75 million in Emergency Relief Funding (ERF) in FY 2022. ADAP ERF awards are intended for states/territories that demonstrate the need for additional resources to prevent, 166 Health Resources and Services Administration.

These funds are required to be used for ADAP services, including the purchase of medications, insurance premium assistance, and medication copay assistance. Stat es that developed need through unforeseen events also can request RWHAP Part B supplemental funds to assist in meeting shortfalls. HRSA continues to closely monitor the impact of ending the COVID -19 public health emergency and the Medicaid continuous enrol lment requirement on the ADAPs. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part B of $1.3 billion is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request includes $900.3 million for RWHAP ADAPs to provide access to life saving HIV related medications and funding to provide direct health care services for people with HIV in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and five Associated Pacific Jurisdictions. RWHAP Part B grant recipients will continue to work directly with uninsured people with HIV to ensure access to health care coverage and will continue to support HIV medications not on health plan formularies and the cost sharing required by health coverage plans. ADA P resources will also support the continued: increase in RWHAP clients as more people with HIV are diagnosed, linked to care, and retained in care increase in people who require assistance with insurance premiums and cost -sharing need for medication an d/or health care coverage assistance for clients who remain uninsured RWHAP Part B funding will also contribute to achieving the FY 2024 targets for performance goals that related to cross -cutting activities, such as the total number of clients served, an d the percentage of clients (total and minority clients) who achieved viral suppression. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program s upport costs. 296 Funding History167 Fiscal Accomplishments The RWHAP Part B has contributed to the tremendous progress the RWHAP has made toward ending the HIV epidemic in the United States.

AIDS Drug Assistance Program According to the RWHAP ADAP data, the number of people with HIV receiving ADAP services has grown 38 percent over the last ten years from 208,809 clients in 2010, to 289,290 clients in 2021, exceeding the FY 2021 target by 4,290. In FY 2020, the RWHAP ADAP provided medication and health care coverage assistance for nearly 29 pe rcent of people diagnosed with HIV in the United States. Of all the ADAP clients served nationwide, 72 percent had incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and 70 percent were racial and ethnic minorities. The RWHAP ADAP plays a cruci al role in ensuring access to HIV medications for pregnant women. Mother -to-child transmission in the United States has decreased dramatically since its peak in 1992 due to 1) an increased focus on HIV testing for all pregnant women; and 2) the use of anti retroviral therapy, which significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission from the mother to her baby. In 2021, 99 percent of HIV -positive pregnant women served by the RWHAP (Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D) were prescribed antiretroviral therapy to prevent maternal -to- child transmission of HIV, exceeding the FY 2021 performance target by 3 percentage points.

The network includes two national centers, eight regional centers, more than 85 regional partner (local sites), the online National HIV Curriculum, and two Integration of the National HIV Curriculum into Health Professions Training programs The RWHAP AETC program leverages multidisciplinary education and training programs for health care providers in the prevention and treatment of HIV, bolstering the health workforce to ensure delivery of quality services and care for underserved populations . Endin g the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. - AETC Program Eleven RWHAP AETC Program recipients received funding through the Ending HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative to expand workforce capacity by offering training and technical assistance to health care providers and par aprofessionals in FY 2022. Jurisdictions utilize their existing infrastructure to implement effective and innovative strategies, interventions, approaches, and services to reduce new HIV infections in the United States. 307 Budget Request The FY 2024 Bu dget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part F -AETC of $34.8 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. The requested funding levels will assure access to high -quality HIV care by supporting targeted, multidisciplinary education and tr aining programs for new and experienced health care providers treating people with HIV. The RWHAP AETC Program also provides expert advice to providers across the country on HIV treatment, pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce HIV transmission, substance use disorders, viral hepatitis co - infection, post -exposure prophylaxis, and the treatment of pregnant women with HIV and their newborns to prevent mother -to-child transmission. The RWHAP AETC Program funds a National HIV Curriculum e -Learning Platform for medical providers on HIV care and treatment to assure continued training of providers from medical/nursing school through in -service training. The central focus of RWHAP AETC tr aining is to ensure high quality care and positive patient outcomes through HIV care and treatment that is consistent with established treatment guidelines and reflects current research. This is increasingly important as people with HIV are living longer. In addition, the number of experienced HIV care professionals is projected to decrease as many of those who have worked in the epidemic since its inception reach retirement age. Training an expanded cadre of culturally competent, high -quality providers is vital to increasing access to quality HIV care and treatment and improving health outcomes for people with HIV. HRSA will continue to prioritize interactive training and technical assistance that result in health system strengthening and transformation, with a particular focus on training health care providers on delivering high quality HIV care and treatment services in primary care settings that have typically not provided services to people with HIV. The funding request also includes costs associat ed with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs. Funding History191 Fiscal Year Amount FY 191 EHE funding is not included in this table. 308 Program Accomplishments The RWHAP AETC Program targets training to health care providers who serve underserved populations, including rural communities, racial and ethnic minority populations, the homeless, incarcerated persons, federally qualified community and migrant health ce nters, and RWHAP sites. AETC -trained health care providers are trained to offer innovative and culturally - and linguistically appropriate healthcare services that empowers clients. This directly supports the HHS goal to protect and strengthen equitable ac cess to high quality and affordable healthcare. The RWHAP AETC Program trains providers through a variety of training modalities, including didactics, clinical preceptorships, self -study, clinical consultation, communities of practice and distance -based technologies. A variety of educational formats are used, including skills building workshops, hands -on preceptorships and mini -residencies, on -site training, tele -education, and technical assistance. For example, the RWHAP AETC implemented an online intera ctive platform that hosts an HIV care and treatment curriculum targeted to health care professionals. Clinical faculty also provides timely clinical consultation in person or via the telephone or internet.

FY 2024 Authorization...............................................................................Expired Allocation Method: Competitive Grants Formula Grants Contracts Program Description The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part F funding supports two dental programs: 1) HIV/AIDS Dental Reimbursement Program (DRP); and 2) Community -Based Dental Partnership Program (CBDPP). The RWHAP DRP ensures access to oral health care for low -income people with HIV by reimbursing dental education programs for the non -reimbursed costs they incur providing such care. By offsetting the costs of non -reimbursed HIV care in accredited dental education institutions, the RWHAP DRP improves access to oral h ealth care for low -income people with HIV and ensures quality services by dental students, dental hygiene students, and dental residents for providing oral health care services to people with HIV. The care provided through the program includes a full range of diagnostic, preventive, and treatment services, including oral surgery, as well as oral health education and health promotion. Dental schools, post -doctoral dental education programs, and dental hygiene education programs accredited by the Commission o n Dental Accreditation that have documented non -reimbursed costs for providing oral health care to people with HIV are eligible to apply for reimbursement. Funds are then distributed to eligible organizations taking into account the number of people served and the cost of providing care. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part F -Dental of $13.6 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. These requested levels w ill support oral health care for people w ith HIV and the reimbursement of applicant institutions through the RWHAP Dental Reimbursement Program and funding of the RWHAP Community -Based Dental Partnership Program . 310 The FY 2024 funding request will support the RWHAP target for training 21,000 provi ders through both dental programs (includes both didactic and clinical trainings). The FY 2024 funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology , and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount FY 2014 FY the RWHAP DRP awards were able to provide 39 percent of the total non - reimbursed costs requested by 48 participating institutions in support of oral health care. These institutions reported providing care to 19,142 people with HIV, a nearly seven percent increase from 2020 despite the COVID -19 related disruptions in the delivery of oral health care nationwide . The RWHAP CBDPP supports collaborations between dental education programs and community -based partners to deliver oral health services in community settings while supporting students and residents enrolled in accredited dental educations programs. In FY 2021, RWHAP CBDPP funded 12 partnership grants to support collaboration and coordination between the dental education programs and the community -based partners in the delivery of oral health services. 311 Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 Target for whom a portion/percentage of their unreimbursed oral health costs were reimbursed.

Through dem onstration and implementation projects, SPNS evaluate the design, utilization, cost, and health -related outcomes of treatment strategies while systemically promoting the dissemination and replication of successful interventions through tools kits and other modalities that allow for rapid dissemination and uptake. This unique program advances knowledge and skills in the delivery of health care and support services to underserved populations. As healthcare systems work under increasingly dynamic conditions, evidence -based, evidence - informed, and emerging strategies are essential to ensure that research investments maximize healthcare value and improve public health. RWHAP SPNS -funded projects use implementation science - the scientific study of methods to pr omote the systematic uptake of research findings into routine practice - to document and capture how well interventions and strategies improve the quality and effectiveness of health services, maximize resources, and improve health outcomes for people with HIV. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part F -SPNS of $25 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. The requested funding will support the continued development of innovative intervention strategi es of HIV care and treatment for populations that have traditionally had lower rates of continuous care and viral suppression. Through demonstration and implementation projects, SPNS evaluate the design, utilization, cost, and health -related outcomes of treatment strategies while systemically promoting the dissemination and replication of successful interventions through tools kits and other modalities 313 that allow for rapid dissemination and uptake. This unique program advances knowledge and skills in the delivery of health care and support services to underserved populations. In particular, RWHAP SPNS -funded projects use implementation science - the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings into routine practice - to document and capture how well interventions and strategies improve the quality and effectiveness of health services, maximize resources, and improve health outcomes for people with HIV.

FY 2024 Authorization........................................................................Not Specified Allocation Method: Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreements Contracts Program Description The Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative is an HHS -wide effort to reduce new HIV infections to fewer than 3,000 per year by 2030. The multi -year EHE initiative currently focuses on 48 counties, Washington, D.C., San Juan (PR), as well as 7 states that have a substantial rural HIV burden (EHE jurisdictions). HRSA's fo cus is on linking people with HIV who are either newly diagnosed, diagnosed but currently not in care, or are diagnosed in care but not yet virally suppressed to the essential HIV care and treatment and support services needed to help them achieve viral su ppression. Funding levels for the EHE initiative were informed by modeling by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that analyzed the impact of specific activities (increased engagement in care and viral suppression, and Pre -Exposure Proph ylaxis (PrEP) services uptake) on priority communities, and costs related to provision of these services. At current funding levels, it is estimated that HRSA will serve 76,000 people. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $290 million for Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) is $125 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. These requested levels will support HIV care and treatment in the 48 counties, DC, San Juan (PR), and seven states tha t contain more than 50% of new HIV infections. In FY 2024, HRSA will continue to direct EHE funding to the current 39 RWHAP Part A jurisdictions that contain one or more of the counties and the current eight RWHAP Part B states (including funding to the s tate of Ohio for Hamilton County, which is not a RWHAP Part A). HRSA coordinates with the respective RWHAP ADAPs to ensure necessary resources are available to provide assistance for medications and health care coverage premiums and cost sharing for people newly diagnosed with HIV or re -engaged in care through the initiative. The RWHAP's comprehensive system of HIV care and support services and effective system for 316 medication delivery creates a very efficient and effective service delivery mechanism for thi s initiative. The FY 2024 request of $290 million will greatly increase HRSA's ability to meet the goals of the initiative178. The request will support HIV care and treatment needs for an estimated 76,000 clients. The request will allow HRSA to continue e fforts to engage people who are newly diagnosed and maintain the HIV care and treatment for those who were reengaged and newly diagnosed in prior years of the initiative. As more people with HIV receive HIV care and treatment, an increase in EHE funding is critical for engaging those out of care and keeping an increasing number of patients on medications to prevent HIV transmissions and improve HIV health outcomes. As part of EHE, HRSA will fund the RWHAP AETC Program to provide training and technical assis tance to health care providers, clinics, and paraprofessionals as well as health departments to increase HIV testing, care and treatment, the provision of PrEP services, and retention in care. HRSA will continue to direct funding to support technical assi stance and systems coordination to enhance the current Bureau Reporting Systems (BRS) to provide timely monitoring of the EHE initiative; to support dissemination of effective interventions to increase the number of people with HIV served by the initiative ; to provide additional technical assistance to jurisdictions to implement models of care that work to identify and link and retain the key populations for the EHE initiative. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount FY 2014 --- FY 2015 --- FY 2016 --- FY 2017 --- Accomplishments The EHE -funded technical assistance (TA) and systems coordination cooperative agreements will continue to support strategies such as data to care efforts that leverage HIV surveillance and other data to identify persons living with HIV who are in need of HIV medical care or other services and facilitating li nkage to these services ; using acuity tools to identify and provide care for the most challenging patients; developing models such as low -barrier clinics to meet patients where they are; rapid engagement and medication initiation protocols; and others that have been successful in the field. HRSA and the TA entity utilize and disseminate those lessons learned nationally. 317 The EHE jurisdictions funded by HRSA will continue to work with their respective ADAPs to ensure necessary resources are available to provi de assistance for medications and health care coverage premiums and cost sharing for people newly diagnosed with HIV or re -engaged in care through the EHE initiative. As part of the EHE initiative, the RWHAP Part F AIDS Education and Training Center (AET C) Program will continue to expand workforce capacity by providing training and technical assistance to health care providers and paraprofessionals. This will include activities such as training health care providers on HIV medical care and treatment and P re-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) service delivery; working with clinics and health care providers to develop culturally competent settings and approaches to the populations reached through the EHE initiative; and providing technical assistance on practice tr ansformation in clinics to increase HIV testing, linkage to care, rapid antiretroviral therapy delivery, and improved viral suppression. HRSA -funded EHE jurisdictions made significant progress toward implementing the EHE workplans despite the COVID -19 pan demic, and in FY 2021, HRSA EHE -funded service providers served 22,413 clients who were new or re -engaged in HIV care.

The following helped inform the methodology for establishing all four viral suppression targets (both RWHAP and EHE -specific targets) : People with HIV who are not engaged in c are tend to have more complex needs than those that remain engaged. Multiple studies indicate that patients retained in care are more likely to achieve viral suppression compared to those not engaged in regular care. Viral suppression can take 3 or more m onths to achieve based on viral dynamics if the person is routinely engaged in care and able to maintain adherence to HIV medications . . Due to the significant number of clients who are not in care or routinely retained in care who will be engaged/re -engaged through the EHE efforts , there is a potential negative impact that new EHE clients may have on overall viral suppression rates as people who are not in care or not retained in care routinely have lower viral suppression rates . Despite th e improved rates of durable viral suppression in the RWHAP overall ,, vulnerable populations , including clients who have been out of care and who have co - morbidities such as mental health and substance use disorders, are still at increased risk of virologic al failure.192 Baselines and targets for EHE measures have been changed due to improvements in EHE reporting and data quality. The baselines for Measure 4060.01 and Measure 4060.02 have been updated with available data from the calendar year 2021 Ryan Whit e HIV/AIDS Services Report. The FY 2024 target for Measure 4060.01 reflects a n increase in funding. Note that targets for this measure were adjusted due to a refinement of this performance measure and methodology. The targets were previously based on cum ulative clients. The new targets for FY 2023 and FY 2024 are based on newly enrolled clients only. The FY 2024 target for Measure 4060.02 is to maintain enrollment as each year will represent a new cohort of patients who are 192 Durability of viral suppression with first -line antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV in the UK: an observational cohort study.

The National Organ Transplant Act requires HRSA to oversee a national system, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), to allocate and distribute donor organs to individuals waiting for transplants. Organ allocation is guided by OPTN policies informed by analytical support from the Scientific Registry of Tr ansplant Recipients (SRTR). In addition, HRSA funds the Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program (formerly Reimbursement of Travel and Subsistence Expenses toward Living Organ Donation Program) to provide financial assistance to eligible living organ d onors. HRSA also invests in public education and outreach to increase the number of registered organ donors, increase the supply of deceased donor organs for transplantation, and ensure living organ donors' safety. The OPTN is a critical system that faci litates matching donor organs to transplant candidates. Given the high demand for and limited supply of organs, OPTN policies are under continual review and refinement to achieve the best outcomes for patients, attain the maximum benefit for the maximum n umber of waitlist candidates, make the best use of donor organs, and align with policy requirements of the OPTN final rule (42 CFR 121). OPTN operating costs are covered by appropriated funds and revenues generated by registration fees for transplant cand idates placed on the waiting list. The SRTR provides analytical support to the OPTN in the development of organ allocation policies and performance evaluation. Additionally, the SRTR provides analytical support to HHS, including the ACOT. SRTR shares information publicly about the performance of 324 transplant programs and organ procurement organizations at https://www.srtr.org/ . It publishes online transplant program risk -adjusted patient and graft outcomes data and organ procurement organization risk -adjusted data on organs procured per donor. SRTR also publishes a comprehensive Annual Data Report that includes the most current ten years of data on waitlist, transplant, and deceased donor organ donation. HRSA colla borates with the organ donation and transplantation community to promote awareness of the need for donated organs and to encourage public enrollment on organ donor registries (state or national). Outreach activities include: Public service announcement campaigns for radio, TV, and publications nationwide Educational web videos for reposting, downloading, and social media Radio Ad Spotlights during high -traffic drive -time hours in designated markets with the highest numbers of African Americans, Asians, Hispanics or Latinos, and people 50 years and older. Data reveals gaps between the number of patients waiting for an organ and the number of donors from these groups. Organ donation and transplantation related articles for newspapers and journals HRSA's or gan donation sites: www.organdonor.gov and https:// donaciondeorganos.gov Grant projects to test approaches to promote public awareness of the need for organ donation and increase donor registration In September 2020, HRSA increased the income eligibility threshold for the Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program from 300 to 350 percent of the HHS Poverty Guidelines. The Program also expanded the qualified reimbursable expenses to include lost wag es and dependent care expenses (childcare and eldercare). The changes aim to increase the number of kidney transplants from living donors and decrease recipient waiting times. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $67 million is $36 million more than the FY 2023 Enacted level. HRSA plans to address priority issues to increase accessibility, transparency, and equitable distribution of organs through modernization of the OPTN. This request will invest in critical needs to advance OPTN modernization . The budget request also includes a legislative proposal to modernize the statute that governs the OPTN to improve oversight, transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the organ transplantation system. Specifically, this budget request will support two key initiatives: 1). Program Modernization Design to focus on policy, governance, and technology to drive improvements in IT system performance, health equity, patient outcomes and patient safety; and 2). Modernization Strategy Implementation which wi ll launch implementation of the design features needed to improve system processes, patient experience, and accountability. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and info rmation technology and other program support costs. 325 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Program Accomplishments The Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program processed more donor applications in 2022 compared 2021. One of HRSA's primary goals for the Organ Transplantation Program is to increase the annual number of transplants using deceased do nor organs. The organ procurement and transplantation community has achieved increases in the numbers of deceased donor organs procured and organ transplants performed annually since 2015. The number of deceased donor organs transplanted in 2022 was 39, 861 compared to 38, 093 in 2021 . HRSA continues to support efforts to remove financial barriers to living organ donation under the Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program. In 2022, the Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program facilitated more than 1,040 living organ transplants, w ith more than 44% going to R/E minorities .

Bill Young Cell Transplantation...........................................................$31,009,000 National Cord Blood Inventory..............................................................$23,000,000 Allocation Method........................................................................................Contract Program Description The Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Program (BSCTP) is charged with increasing the number of transplants for recipients suitably matched to biologically unrelated bone marrow194 and umbilical cord blood donors. HRSA achieves this goal by: 1) providing a national system for recruiting potential bone marrow donors; 2) tissue typing potential marrow donors; 3) buildi ng a genetically and ethnically diverse inventory of at least 150,000 new units of high -quality umbilical cord blood units (CBU) for transplantation; 4) coordinating the procurement of bone marrow and umbilical cord blood units for transplantation; 5) offe ring patient and donor advocacy services; 6) providing public and professional education; and, 7) collecting, analyzing, and reporting data on transplant outcomes. These activities, which were previously implemented and reported through two separate progr ams, the National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI) Program and the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program (CWBYCTP),. Blood stem cell transplantation, which includes bone marrow and cord blood, is a potentially curative therapy for many individuals with leukemia and other life -threatening blood and genetic disorders. Each year, nearly 18,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with life - threatening illnesses where blood stem cell transplantation from matched donors is the best treatment option. Often, the ideal donor is a suitably matched family member, however, only 30 percent of people have a fully matched relative. The other 70 percent, often search for a matched unrelated adult donor or umbilical cord blood unit. 193 The National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI) and the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program (CWBYCTP) were funded separately in FY 2022 and FY 2023. 194 Public Health Service Act, Sections 379 -379B, as amended by P.L. 117 -15 states that the term 'bone marrow' means the cells found in the adult bone marrow and peripheral blood. 328 The BSCTP operates through four maj or functions that require close coordination and oversight and supports an Advisory Council that provides recommendations to the HHS Secretary and HRSA on activities related to the BSCTP. The major functions of the BSCTP are: The combined Single Point of Access - Coordinating Center (SPA -CC) maintains a system for health care professionals and physicians, searching on behalf of patients, to search electronically for cells derived from adult marrow donors and cord blood units through a single point of acce ss and supports coordination activities for bone marrow and cord blood. The Office of Patient Advocacy (OPA) maintains a system for patient advocacy, which provides individualized patient services for ongoing searches for bone marrow donors or cord blood units. The OPA also assists patients with information regarding treatment options and payment matters. The Stem Cell Therapeutic Outcomes Database (SCTOD) provides an electronic blood stem cell transplant outcomes database for researchers and health car e professionals. The SCTOD provides a repository that stores donor and recipient samples for research and the collection and analysis of data on clinical outcomes of blood stem cell transplants. The Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Program provides funds through competitive contracts for the collection and storage of qualified cord blood units (CBUs) by a network of public umbilical cord blood banks in the U.S. HRSA prioritizes cord blood banks that have biological license agreements (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the demonstrated capability to collect and bank significant numbers of CBUs from genetically and ethnically diverse populations. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $52.3 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacte d level. The FY 2024 request supports continued progress toward the statutory goal of building a genetically and ethnically diverse inventory of at least 150,000 new units of high -quality cord blood for transplantation. HRSA expects the registry will lis t approximately 4 million adult donors who self-identify as belonging to an underrepresented racial or ethnic population and add approximately 3,100 cord blood units in FY 2024. The budget request also continues the following activities: 1) collecting com prehensive outcomes data on both related and unrelated - donor blood stem cell transplants; 2) assessing the quality of life for transplant recipients; 3) working with foreign transplant centers to obtain data on U.S. stem cell products provided for transpla nt; and 4) continuing critical planning in collaboration with HHS on a response to a potential national radiation or chemical emergency. In such an event, casualties could involve temporary or permanent marrow failure and could require emergency transplan ts for individuals unable to recover marrow function. The funding request also includes costs associated with the award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology and other program support costs. 329 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Program Accomplishments The Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Program continues to serve a diverse patient population, with volunteer adult donors and umbilical cord blood units playing a vital role in expanding transplant access to patients from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations. Increasing the number of blood stem cell transplants facilitated for patients from genetically and ethnically diverse backgrounds addresses the statutory aim of ensuring comparable access to transplantation for patients from all populations. As of the end of FY 2022, more than 24 million potential adult volunteer donors and over 111,000 HRSA -funded CBUs (see Table 1) were listed on the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program's registry. Table 1. Cord Blood Collections Fiscal Year HRSA -funded NCBI CBU CBU Collected and Made Available195 4 million adult donors who self -identified as belonging to an underrepresented racial or ethnic population was met. HRSA expects the registry will list 4.02 million adult donors who self-identify as belonging to an underrepresented racial or ethnic population and add 3,127 cord blood units in FY 2024. The number of cord blood units collected varies yearly based on funding levels and the contractors' ability to collect and store units from diverse populations. 195 Due to the lag between when cord blood units are collected and when they have been fully tested and qualified for listing on the public registry, not all of the units collected with funds from a given fiscal year will be available on the registry during t hat same fiscal year. 330 As shown in Table 2, the number of cord blood units released for transplants increased in FY 2022 from FY 2021, at 342 and 313 cord blood units, respectively. The total number of cord blood units released for transplantation has been decreasing since FY 2017 due to the increasing use of alternative therapies. Despite this recent trend, cord blood remains key in servicing a diverse population. Table 2.

Contract Awards Table FY FY 2024 President's Budget Awards 9 9 9 36 36 36 --- Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Section 320, as amended by Public Law 1057-220 FY 2024 Contract Program Description The National Hansen's Disease Program (NHDP) provides medical care, education, and research for Hansen's disease (HD, leprosy) and related conditions as authorized since 1917. Medical care includes providing direct patient care (diagnosis, treatment, and r ehabilitation), HD drug regimens at no cost to patients, consultations, laboratory services, and outpatient referral services to any patient residing in the United States (U.S.) or its territories. The Program strengthens the safety net infrastructure for patients with this rare disease by focusing on case management, patient compliance, and clinical training on the diagnosis and management of Hansen's disease. The Program makes specific outreach efforts to health care providers who are likely to encounter and treat patients in geographic areas most impacted by the disease. The more complicated HD cases are treated as short -term referrals in the NHDP clinic in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Ninety -five percent of the human population is not susceptible to infec tion with Mycobacterium leprae or Mycobacterium lepromatosis, the bacteria that cause leprosy. Hansen's disease is not highly transmissible, is very treatable, and is not disabling with early diagnosis and treatment. Treatment with standard antibiotic dru gs is very effective, and patients become noninfectious after taking only a few doses of medication and need not be isolated from family and friends. However, diagnosis in the U.S. is often delayed because many health care providers are unaware of Hansen's disease and its symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment prevent nerve involvement and the disability it causes. People with leprosy can generally continue their normal work and other activities while under treatment, which may last several years. Protect individuals, families, and communities against communicable and infectious disease through effective, innovative, readily available, and equitable delivery of treatment and therapeutics: Increasing health care provider knowledge about Hansen's disease wil l lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment, which are crucial to blocking or arresting the trajectory of Hansen's disease -related disability and deformity. The Program facilitates outpatient 334 management of leprosy by providing additional laboratory, diagnost ic, consultative, and referral services to private -sector physicians. NHDP increases U.S. health care providers' knowledge by serving as an education and referral center. The NHDP outpatient care is comprehensive and includes treatment protocols for multi -drug therapy, diagnostic studies, provider consultations, ancillary medical services, clinical laboratory analysis, hand and foot rehabilitation, leprosy surveillance, and patient transportation. Improve the design, delivery, and outcomes of HHS pro grams by prioritizing science, evidence, and inclusion: The Program is improving health outcomes through scientific research. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for decreasing HD -related disability. With advanced scientific knowledge and breakthro ughs in genomics and molecular biology, the Program has advanced the standard of care for leprosy diagnosis and treatment. Currently, lab research uses rapid techniques for diagnosis, assessment of drug resistance, and strain typing of leprosy bacilli to support effective treatment and determine the origin and transmission of infection. Invest in the research enterprise and the scientific workforce to maintain leadership in the development of innovations that broaden our understanding of disease, health c are, public health, and human services resulting in more effective interventions, treatments, and programs: NHDP is the sole worldwide provider of reagent grade viable leprosy bacilli and collaborates with researchers across the globe to support scientific advances related to the disease. NHDP coordinates and collaborates with Federal, State, local, and private programs to promote and improve the quality of care and health outcomes related to Hansen's disease. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request o f $13.7 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request supports the Program's primary focus of direct patient care activities and improving health outcomes for Hansen's disease patients. The funding level reflects improvements in health outco mes through research and health care provider education. NHDP will recompete its ambulatory care contracts in FY 2023 with continuing efforts to align resources with levels of care. Hansen's disease patients with severe complications who are advanced on t he HD spectrum or who have HD related disabilities may be referred to the primary clinic in Baton Rouge, free of charge. The National Hansen's Disease Program also provides free HD medication to all providers upon request for the care and treatment of HD patients in the U.S. and its territories. The request will allow NHDP to continue outreach and education to the medical community about the diagnosis and treatment of Hansen's disease. Finally, the request will provide for the purchase and maintenance of s tate-of-the-art laboratory equipment to perform PCR testing of patient tissue samples. The funding request also includes costs associated with the contract review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs. 335 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Program Accomplishments To improve public health by raising awareness, the NHDP used digital and social media platforms to assist individuals in recognizing the signs and symptoms of Hansen's disease, as well as presented on leprosy at national conferences for health professional s. To improve access to quality health services: NHDP reduced the burden for patients and practitioners served by the National Hansen's Disease Program by completing 1,159 telehealth or teleconsultation sessions in FY 2022. To accelerate advancements in science and research: NHDP's Lab Research Branch submitted 13 manuscripts for peer -reviewed journals in FY 2022. Additionally, three abstracts were accepted for the International Leprosy Congress in November 2022. Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result/ Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY 2023 5050.01 Number health care received training from NHDP (Output) FY 2022: 662 Target: 500 (Target Exceed) 600 700 +100 5050.02 Number of human tissue samples on which clinically diagnostic Polymerase Chain Reactions were performed (Output) FY 2022: 232 Target: 200 (Target Exceeded) 200 200 Maintain 336 Performance Narrative NHDP conducts Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) on all tissue samples received. Using PCR in conjunction with histopathological interpretation of tissue samples increases the accuracy of HD diagnosis. Additionally, using PCR alone provides the determination of a positive diagnosis sooner, allowing the provider to start treatment protocols without delay. Finally, PCR is the only test currently available to distinguish between M. leprae and M. lepromatosi s infection, which has important implications in the clinical management of the disease. 337 National Hansen's Disease Program - Payment to Hawaii FY 2022 --- --- --- --- Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Section 320(d), as amended by Public Law 105-78, Section 211 FY 2024 Authorization........................................................................Indefinite Allocation Method............................................................................ Direct Federal Program Description Payments are made to the State of Hawaii for the medical care and treatment of persons with Hansen's disease. Through the Han sen's Disease Community Program administered by the Hawaii Department of Health, the State monitors and treats Hansen's disease throughout Hawaii. Expenses above the level of the Federal funds appropriated for the support of medical care are borne by the State of Hawaii. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the National Hansen's Disease Program - Payment to Hawaii of $1.9 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request supports the payment made to the State of Hawaii for the medical care and treatment of persons wit h Hansen's disease. Funding History Fiscal Year FY 2022 accomplishments focused on continuing the case management of 262 active registered cases along with 595 registered contacts, amid the COVID 19 pandemic. Efforts were made to have protective supplies to both staff and patients so that face to face c ase management and contact tracing services could be maintained in a safe manner. Staff time and energy went to also educating about COVID 19 precautions and measure to take. Hansen's disease patients in 338 reaction could have more complications if they also had COVID 19, so program efforts were made to get patients to clinics for vaccines, boosters, and testing when needed. FY 2023 saw the return of the program doing outreach and mass education and Hansen's disease screening for early detection among the hig h-risk individuals in the two Job Corp Centers in the State of Hawaii. This also involves travel of staff to neighbor islands which had to be curtailed during the pandemic. Individuals who are screened and show suspicious signs of Hansen's disease are refe rred for further medical evaluation and the program will cover the cost of biopsies and testing if the person has no access to medical insurance. This FY, we were able to find a willing provider in rural Maui who is willing to see our referrals. Prior to t his FY, the area had not had steady medical access for Hansen's disease medical. Another group requiring more intensive case management in this FY is the formerly institutionalized patients who elected to live in the community on their own. This population is steadily aging and requiring additional services and assistive aids to keep them safe in their own homes. 339 National Hansen's Disease Program - Buildings and Facilities FY 2022 --- --- --- --- Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Sections 320 FY 2024 Authorization.......................................................................

Funding History Fiscal Program Accomplishments Past funding has been used to update patient rooms at Carville - eliminating deficiencies and bringing facilities up to acceptable standards of safety, comfort, and human dignity. 340 Rural Health Policy TAB 341 FEDERAL OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH POLICY Rural Health Policy Development FY 2022 Final 3 3 3 --- Authorizing Legislation: Social Security Act, Section 711, as amended by 21st Century Cures Act, Sections 2012, 2013, 2035, and 2043, Public Law 114 -255. FY 2024 Authorization ...........................................................................Indefinite Allocation Method ................................ ..................... Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreement Program Description The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) is charged with advising the HHS Secretary on how rural health care is affected by current policies as well as proposed statutory, regulatory, administrative, and budgetary changes in the Medicare, Medicaid and other key HHS programs. The authorizing legislation requires FORHP to advise on: (1) the financial viability of small rural hospitals; (2) the ability of rural areas (particularly rural hospitals) to attract and retain physicians and other health professionals; and (3) access to and quality of health care in rural areas. FORHP is also charged with overseeing compliance, per the requirements of section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, related to assessing the impact of key regul ations affecting a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Rural Health Policy Development funds a number of programs to carry out these advisory and compliance roles, including supporting clearinghouses for collecting and disseminating information on rural health care issues, promising approaches to improving and enhancing health care delivery in rural communities, and policy -relevant research findings addressing rural health care delivery. FORHP provides funding for the only Federal research progr ams specifically designed to provide publicly available, policy relevant studies on rural health issues. The Rural Health Research Center (RHRC) Program , which is competitive in FY 2024, funds eight core research centers to conduct policy -oriented health s ervices research. The RHRCs produce policy briefs and peer -reviewed journal manuscripts and make their publications available to policy makers and other rural stakeholders at both the Federal and state levels. The Rapid Response Rural Data Analysis and Is sue Specific Rural Research Studies Program supports one award to conduct rapid data analyses and short -term rural research studies. The Rural Health and Economic Development Analysis Program supports one award to analyze the economic impacts of local health care sectors on rural economies. The Rural Health Research Dissemination Program , currently awarded to the Rural Health Research Gateway, disseminates , and promotes FORHP - funded rural health services research to stakeholders at the national, state, and community levels 342 with the goal of informing and raising awareness of key policy issues important to rural communities. This research also aligns with Administration priorities, such addressing substance use, increasing access to care, and improving health equity. FORHP funds programs that collect and disseminate information on rural health care issues and identify promising approaches to improving and enhancing health care delivery in rural communities. The National Rural Health Information Clearinghouse Program , currently awarded to the Rural Health Information Hub, serves as a clearinghouse for information on rural health, including HRSA's rural health programs, for residents of rural areas in the United States and other rural health stakeholders. The National Rural Health Policy, Community, and Collaboration Program engages rural stakeholders to educate and collaborate on national rural health policy issues and promising practices to improve the health of people living in rural communities nationwide. The Rural Telementoring Training Center Program provides training for academic medical centers and other centers of excellence to create technology -enabled telementoring learning programs that focus on reaching regionally diverse populations and addressing unique cultural aspects across rural areas. The Rural Health Clinic (RHC) Technical Assistance Program identifies key policy, regulatory, programmatic, and clinical issues facing RHCs and informs RHCs and other rural stakeholders about key RHC issues. The Rural Health Innovation and Transformation Technical Assistance Program provides technical assistance to support rural health care through innovative payment models and to promote the value -based care landscape in the context of rural health care. Rural H ealth Policy Development also supports the staffing for the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services (NACRHHS), which advises the HHS Secretary on rural health and human service programs and policies, produces policy briefs, and makes recommendations on emerging rural policy issues. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $11.1 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request would allow HRSA to fully fund the following: Rural Health Research Center Program; Rapid Response Rural Data Analysis and Issue Specific Rural Research Studies Program; Rural Health Research Gateway; National Rural Health Information Clearinghouse Program; National Rural Health Policy, Community, and Collaboration Program; Rural Telementoring Training Center Program; Rural Health Clinic Technical Assistance Program; Rural Health and Economic Development Analysis Program; Rural Health Innovation and Transformation Technical Assistance Program; and the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. 343 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Program Accomplishments The Rural Health Research Center Program increases the amount of publicly available, policy - relevant research to assist providers and decision/policy -makers at the federal, state, and local levels to better understand health and health care problems faced by rural communities. This work also informs FORHP's statutory charge to advise the H HS Secretary on rural health policy issues. The eight research centers each receiving funding for four research projects per fiscal year with the expectation that each project will result in at least one publication. Examples of recent research include: Examining the economic effects of rural hospital closures Measuring state and regional differences in the availability of hospital -based obstetric services among rural hospitals Assessing rural -urban differences in child and adolescent mental health Quanti fying trends in health workforce supply in rural areas Analyzing counties with no retail pharmacies Through the Rapid Response Rural Data Analysis and Issue Specific Rural Research Studies Program FORHP continues to monitor and track the number of rural h ospitals across the country that have closed completely or converted to another type of facility that provides only non - inpatient care. From January 1, 2010 to January 31, 2023, 143 rural hospitals have closed. FORHP has funded a number of grants that focu s on addressing hospital closures, particularly mitigating the loss of services due to hospitals closing or facing financial distress. Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 Target 6010.01 Number of rural health research products released during the fiscal year (Output) FY 2022: 81 Target: 43 (Target Exceeded) 47 47 Maintain 344 Performance Narrative In FY 2022, these Federally -funded research programs conducted and disseminated 81 research reports, including policy briefs posted on the Rural Health Research Gateway website and manuscripts published in peer -reviewed journals. This was significantly abo ve the FY 2022 target of 43 research products because several studies resulted in multiple publications. HRSA has repositioned the rural research program to develop more robust technical research products and comprehensive chartbooks and fewer short resear ch briefs. HRSA anticipates that this adjustment will result in a decrease in the total number of research products in FY 2023 and FY 2024 compared to FY 2022. Targets for this measure in future years remain consistent to reflect the requirement of one pub lication per research project and level funding of the program.

FY Allocation Method ................................ ............ Competitive Grants and Cooperative Agreements Program Description The Rural Health Care Services Outreach, Network and Quality Improvement Grants (Outreach programs) improve rural community health by focusing on quality improvement, increasing health care access, coordination of care, and integration of services. Outre ach grant programs support collaborative models to deliver basic health care services to rural areas and are uniquely designed to meet rural needs. The grants allow rural communities to compete for funding against other rural communities, rather than compe ting against larger metropolitan communities with greater resources. The Outreach programs are structured to allow applicants and grantees to determine the best ways to meet local needs. This flexibility responds to the unique health care challenges in rur al communities and enables communities to determine the best approaches for addressing needs. Eligible entities for these programs are community - based organizations serving rural areas. Rural Health Care Services Outreach Program focuses on improving acc ess to health care in rural communities through community coalitions and evidence based and promising practice models. These grants focus on disease prevention, health promotion, and can support the expansion of services around primary care, opioid use dis order treatment and prevention, behavioral health, and oral health care. HRSA will support 61 continuing awards in FY 2024. Rural Health Network Development Program supports formalized partnerships among health care providers and social and community serv ice organizations collaborating to improve access and enhance the quality of healthcare in rural areas. The program focuses on demonstrating improved health outcomes resulting from network collaboration, as well as positioning healthcare networks and their products and services to be sustainable 346 as the health care landscape continues to evolve. Grantees under this program are likely to focus on improving health outcomes, enhancing health care quality, and increasing services provided by the network. HRSA wi ll fund 44 continuing awards in FY 2024. Rural Health Network Development Planning Program assist in the development of integrated healthcare networks to address local health care challenges. The Network Planning program provides an opportunity for grante es to work on priority and emerging local public health issues, such as care coordination, patient engagement, rural hospital closure/conversion, telehealth, mental health, and substance use disorder. HRSA will make over 30 new awards in FY 2024. Small He althcare Provider Quality Improvement Grants help improve patient care and chronic disease outcomes by assisting rural primary care providers with the implementation of quality improvement activities. Specifically, program objectives include increased care coordination, enhanced chronic disease management, and improved health outcomes for patients. An additional program goal is to prepare rural health care providers for quality reporting and pay -for-performance programs. HRSA will support 21 continuing awar ds in FY 2024. Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies (RMOMS) grants improve access and continuity of maternal and obstetrics care in rural communities. In FY 2019, HRSA created RMOMS as a pilot program in response to research by the Univer sity of Minnesota that revealed a decreasing availability of obstetric units in rural areas.199 This program intends to demonstrate the impact on access to and continuity of maternal and obstetrics care in rural communities through testing models that addr ess the following focus Areas: 1) Rural Hospital Obstetric Service Aggregation and Approaches to Risk Appropriate Care 2) Network Approach to Coordinating a Continuum of Care 3) Leveraging Telehealth and Specialty Care 4) Financial Sustainability As part of an HHS -wide initiative to improve maternal health, HRSA will support 7 continuing awards and 2 new awards . Delta Region Community Health Systems Development Programs enhance healthcare delivery in the rural counties and parishes of the Missis sippi Delta region. HRSA implements these programs in coordination with the Delta Regional Authority . The Delta Region Community Health Systems Development technical assistance program helps rural communities address their health care needs in a targeted manner and assists small rural hospitals and clinics improve their financial and operational performance. HRSA will continue to support this award in FY 2024. This single awardee provides resources to help rural communities develop partnerships and jointl y address health problems that 199 Hung P, Henning -Smith C, Casey M, Kozhimannil, K.

The Delta Region Rural Health Workforce Training Program helps improve healthcare delivery in rural areas by training fut ure and current health professionals for high -quality jobs in the rural counties and parishes of the Mississippi Delta Region in the following critical administrative support professions: medical coding and billing, insurance claims processing, health info rmation management, clinical documentation, business operations for healthcare organizations, and supply chain and materials management. HRSA will support five continuing awards in FY 2024. The Delta States Rural Development Network Grant Program provides network development grants to the eight states in the Mississippi Delta for network and rural health infrastructure development. This program is geographically targeted, given the health care disparities across this eight -state region. The program support s chronic disease management, oral health services, and recruitment and retention efforts for health professionals. The program requires grantees to focus on diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity and to develop programs based on promising practices or evidence -based models. HRSA will make 12 continuing awards in FY 2024. Rural Northern Border Region Healthcare Support Program provides technical assistance to rural communities in the region of the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) in their efforts to enhance access to health (including behavioral health); improve recruitment and retention of health care providers; and assist rural hospitals and clinics in their efforts to take part in health care value efforts. HRSA will support 1 continuing award in FY 2024. Rural Health Care Coordination Program supports rural health consortiums/networks aiming to achieving the overall goals of improving access, delivery, and quality of care through the application of care coordination strategies in rural communities. HRSA will make 10 continuing awards in FY 2024. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $95.4 million is $2.4 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will support the continuation of 158 existing grantees, and 32 new competitive grants that will positively affect health care service delivery for over 520,000 people. This investment includes $10.4 million for RMOMS, an increase of $2.4 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. The Budget will help address unmet needs fo r rural communities which include populations who have historically suffered from poorer health outcomes, health disparities and other inequities. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews , and information technology and other program support costs. 348 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Program Accomplishments Across the most recent investments made in the Outreach programs, findings and key lessons learned from evaluations and case studies are gathered and made available on the RHI Hub's Community Health Gateway so that rural communities from a cross the country can benefit from Outreach program investments and results. Grant funds supported the technical assistance for grantees to ensure successful implementation of their programs and evaluation to demonstrate outcomes of the program. In FY 20 21, 434,448 unique individuals received services through the Outreach, Delta and Quality Improvement Programs and has consistently increased throughout the years. Additionally, these grants are intended to be demonstration projects for rural communities to kick start an initiative that may not be otherwise be implemented with scarce resources and level of competition within the federal grants process. Therefore, sustainability of their projects has been a critical element of these grants. Sustainability is assessed as each program's project period ends. While sustainability rates may vary across grantee cohorts, HRSA expects the majority of projects to continue after Federal funding. In FY 2021, the Small Healthcare Provider Quality Improvement Program gran tees reported that 100% will sustain all or part of their projects. This is partly accomplished by the technical assistance provided by FORHP to the grantees during their grant cycle. Grantees use the newly redesigned Rural Health Information (RHI) Hub's Economic Impact Analysis tool to assess the economic impact of Federal investments. The tool translates project impacts into community -wide benefits, such as number of jobs created, new spending, and impacts of new and expanded services. In FY 2021, the work of Small Healthcare Provider Quality Improvement Program grantees generated an average of $1.85 of economic impact into their rural communities for every HRSA dollar spent. Grantees are also required to demonstrate program impact through outcome -focused measures. Grantees track and submit to HRSA baseline data throughout their project periods and implement programs that are adapted from promising practices or evidence -based models. T he programs support innovative models that offer rural communities the tools and resources to enhance health care services and ease the transition to health care models focusing on improved quality and value. Beginning in FY 2021, FORHP assessed grantees that showed improvement in one or more clinical quality measures. Clinical measures include reductions in diabetic 349 hemoglobin A1c scores (HgbA1c), blood pressure scores, and body mass index (BMI's) calculation. For FY 2020, the Small Healthcare Provider Qu ality Improvement Grants showed that 97% of grantees showed improvement in at least one or more improvement in clinical measures.

Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreements/Contracts Program Description The Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants are offered through three grant programs: Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant (Flex) Program supports a partnership between 45 states and more than 1,300 Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to work on quality, financial, and performance improvement activities, as well as help eligible rural hospitals convert to CAH status and enhance CAH -related eme rgency medical services. The Flex Program's goal is to help CAHs maintain high -quality and economically viable facilities to ensure that rural community residents, particularly Medicare beneficiaries, have access to high -quality health care services. State s use Flex resources to address identified CAH needs and to achieve improved and measurable outcomes in each selected program area. In FY 2022, HRSA funded a new two -year initiative supporting emergency medical services (EMS) across six states focused on q uality improvement efforts. There will be a new competition in FY 2024 for the initiative supporting EMS. Additionally, the general Flex program will be re -competed in FY 2024 and 45 awards are anticipated . The Flex Program plays a key role in ensuring t hat CAHs are aligned with certain Medicare Program quality initiatives. All prospective payment system hospitals (PPS) are required to submit quality data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to receive a full Medicare payment update. Whil e not subject to this CMS requirement, CAHs, through this program, can elect to submit quality data to CMS to demonstrate areas of high quality while also identifying areas for improvement. This provides an avenue for ensuring that CAH quality efforts are aligned with broader Medicare quality initiatives. Small Rural Hospital Improvement Program (SHIP) provides support to states who assist rural hospitals with fewer than 50 beds to enhance their administrative capabilities in meeting information technolo gy and reporting requirements under value -based care 352 through awards to 46 states with eligible hospitals. SHIP provides funding for equipment and training to upgrade billing requirements, such as incorporating new ICD -11 standards, and for software that ca ptures patient satisfaction data. Flex Rural Veterans Health Access Program focuses on increasing the delivery of mental health services or other health care services to meet the needs of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom veterans li ving in rural areas. Grantees focus educating community providers on how to best serve veterans. HRSA continues to partner with the Veteran's Health Administration Office of Rural Health to connect the state level grantees with VHA knowledge and expertise. Rural Emergency Hospital Technical Assistance : In FY 2022, HRSA awarded funds to a national center to ensure rural hospitals and the communities they serve have the information and resources needed to make informed decisions as to whether the Rural Emer gency Hospital model of care is best for their communities and facilitate a successful implementation of Rural Emergency Hospital requirements for those hospitals converting to this new provider type. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $64.3 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will support the continued efforts to states to support Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant, Small Rural Hospital Improvement Grant, and the Rural Veterans Health Access Program. Addit ionally, this request will support funding for the Rural Emergency Hospital Technical Assistance. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program su pport costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Accomplishments FORHP collaborating with rural stakeholders to inform the future direction of the Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project to ensure it aligns with hospital priorities in providing high quality care.

FY 2024 Authorization .................................................................. Expires FY 2027 Allocation Method ................................ ..................... Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreement Program Description This program provides funding to establish and maintain a State Office of Rural Health (SORH) within states to strengthen rural health care delivery systems. Every dollar of Federal support is matched by three state dollars. SORHs serve as focal points and clearinghouses for the collection and dissemination of information on rural health issues, research findings, innovative approaches, and best practices pertaining to the delivery of health care in rural areas. As the state's rural institutional framework , SORHs help link rural communities with state and Federal resources to develop long -term solutions to rural health problems. SORHs form collaborative partnerships to better c oordinate rural health activities, maximize limited resources, and avoid duplicat ion of effort and activities. SORHs facilitate clinical placements through recruitment initiatives and help rural constituents meet recruitment challenges by sharing information. SORHs identify Federal, state, and nongovernmental programs and funding oppor tunities and provide technical assistance to public and nonprofit private entities regarding participation in rural health programs. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the State Offices of Rural Health program of $12.5 million is equal to t he FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will continue to invest in the State Offices of Rural Health who will continue to support rural communities by connecting them with resources about funding opportunities, information on health care policy changes. The State Offices of Rural Health will partner with federal, regional, state, local agencies, and communities to improve access to high quality maternal health and behavioral health services in rural areas. Funding also includes costs associated with the gra nt review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. 356 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Program Accomplishments The State Offices of Rural Health were fundamental to the success of Rural Health Clinics (RHC) implementing projects with COVID -19 funding. SORHs built new relationships with these key providers that are part of the rural health care safety net. Beyond their role of providing information and assistance for RHCs to apply for the COVID -19 funding, SORH incorporated new RHC programming within their regular activities. Fifteen states have RH C activities within their workplans, including hosting regular calls and having RHC specific email lists for resource sharing.

Indefinite Allocation Method ................................ ................................ ........................... Competitive Grants Program Description Established in 2000 under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program (RESEP) provides grants to states, local governments, and appropriate health care organizations to support programs for cancer screening for individuals adversely affected by the mining, transport and processing of uranium and the testing of nuclear weapons for the Nation's weapons arsenal. The RESEP grantees also help clients with appropriate medical referrals, engage in public i nformation development and dissemination, and facilitate claims documentation to aid individuals who may wish to apply for support under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. Eligible entities include organizations located in the high -impact states cite d in the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210 and Public Law 106 -245). These high -impact states include Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, or Wyoming. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $2.7 million is $1 million more than the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will continue to support activities such as: implementing cancer screening programs; developing education programs; disseminating information on ra diogenic diseases and the importance of early detection; screening eligible individuals for cancer and other radiogenic diseases; providing appropriate referrals for medical treatment; and facilitating documentation of Radiation Exposure Compensation Act c laims. On June 7, 2022, the President signed into law the RECA Extension Act of 2022. This law extends the termination of the RECA Trust Fund and the filing deadline for all claims for two years from its date of enactment, extending the statutory deadlin e to June 10, 2024. With this change, increased resources will assist RESEP grantees on furthering outreach and education to facilitate RECA claims documentation. 359 Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount RESEP grantees have continued to implement cancer screening and education programs, share information on radiogenic diseases and the importance of early detection, screen eligible individuals for cancer and other radiogenic disease, provid e appropriate referrals for medical treatment, and facilitate documentation of Radiation Exposure Compensation Act claims. Grantees use evidence -based practice strategies to accomplish their work, incorporating elements including clinical expertise, curr ent best evidence and patient perspectives. Performance has remained consistent compared with previous years. The number of individuals screened increased from 738 in FY 2020 to 832 in FY 2021.

FY 2024 Authorization.................................... ......... ..............................Indefinite Allocation Method............... ........................Competitive Grants /Cooperative Agreement Program Description Established in 1979, through authorization from the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, the Black Lung Clinics Program (BLCP) funds eligible public, private, and state entities that provide medical, outreach, educational, and benefits counseling se rvices to active, inactive, retired, and disabled coal miners throughout the United States. Black Lung Clinics work to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with occupationally related coal -mine dust lung disease. To support the longer -term need fa ced by miners with severe disability due to black lung disease, grantees may also assist coal miners and their families in preparing the detailed application for Federal Black Lung benefits from the Department of Labor (DOL). In the recent years, grantees have been able to use funds to upgrade equipment, enhance their workforce capacity and increase behavioral health screenings and care integration. HRSA also funds the Black Lung Data and Resource Center (BLDRC)in supporting and strengthening the operations of BLCP awardees and their ability to examine and treat respiratory and pulmonary impairments in active and inactive coal miners. BLDRC supports Black Lung Clinics through improved data collection, analysis and expanding the body of knowledge o f the health status and needs of coal miners nationally. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $12.2 million is equal to the FY 2023 Enacted level. HRSA will continue to fund 15 Black Lung Clinic Program awards that provide primary care and other services to coal miners and one cooperative agreement with the Black Lung Data and Resource Center to enhance the quality of services provided by BLCP grantees and work closely with HRSA to strengthen the quality of data collection and analysis. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. 362 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount BLCP achieved 100% participation by grantees for the new patient -level data (PLD) reporting system first piloted in FY2019 -2020. As a result, a more accurate image of grantee productivity has begun to develop. In FY 2021, the grantees predominately leaned on HRSA funding to maintain a community presence to the greatest extent possible in the face of COVID restrictions. In FY 2022, funds were deployed to take advantage of the proliferation of vaccines and loosening of restrictions to spur a push towards pre -pandemic productivity. According to the patient -level data reporting system, BLCP grantees achieve d a 32% average increase in number of miners served between FY 2021 and FY 2022. As well as supporting internal BLCP data management, the Black Lung Data and Resource Center has utilized HRSA funding, and BLCP data, to begin improving the quantity, and quality, of available scientific literature on the health concerns facing coal communities. Most recently, the Black Lung Data and Resource Center published an article detailing the increased mortality rates of miners from non -malignant respiratory disease s as compared to the general population.203 According to the Black Lung Data and Resource Center's findings from a study population of 235,550 deceased miners aged >45 years, odds of death from non -malignant respiratory diseases in \"all miner cohorts avera ged twice those of US males.\" They also noted that \"there was an eightfold increase in odds of death from non -malignant respiratory diseases among miners born after 1940\" and that \"miners with Progressive Massive Fibrosis (PMF) were younger at death\" than those without it. These findings help support the need and level of non -malignant respiratory disease and PMF services BLCP grantees KS, LS, Go LHT, Rose CS, Hall NB, Cohen RA. Increased odds of mortality from non -malignant respiratory disease and lung cancer are highest among US coal miners born after 1939.

Due to the infectious nature of COVID -19, Black Lung grantees were forced to take precautionary measures that reduced the number of medical encounters and services provided but ensured that spread of infectious diseases were kept at a minimum. The result of these precautionary measures means Black Lung Clini cs Program was unable to achieve targets established prior to the COVID -19 pandemic. 364 Grant Awards Table FY Enacted FY 2024 President's Budget Awards 16 16 16 Average Award $654,634 $729,918 $729,918 Range of $2,120,763 $125,000 - $2,120,763 Residency 2 --- Authorizing Legislation: Social Security Act, Section 711(b)(5), as amended by Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Section 432, Public Law 108 - 173. FY 2024 Authorization ............................................................................ Indefinite Allocation Method ................................ ..................... Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreement Program Description Established in FY 2018, the Rural Residency Planning and Development Program seeks to expand the number of rural residency training programs, increase the number of physicians training in rural settings, and subsequently increase the number of physicians choosing to practice in rural areas. For the purpose of this program, rural residencies are accredited allopathic and osteopathic physician residency programs that primarily train residents in rural training sites for greater than 50 percent of their total time in residency and focus on producing physicians who will practice in rural communities. This includes Rural T raining Programs (RTPs) a specific model of rural residency training in which residents gain both urban and rural experience with more than half of the education and training taking place in rural areas. Eligible primary care and high need rural residency specialties include family medicine, family medicine with enhanced obstetrical training, internal medicine, preventive medicine, psychiatry, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology. Research has shown that residents often practice near where they c omplete their residency training. Spending more than half of training time in rural locations during family medicine residency is associated with a 5 - to 6-fold increase in subsequent rural practice204 . The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy collaborate s with HRSA's Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) to fund two activities to create new rural residencies: Rural Residency Planning and Development (RRPD) program creates new physician residency training programs that support physician workforce expansion in rural areas and that are sustainable beyond the grant period of performance through public (i.e., Medicare or Medicaid), other state, or private fundin g. Recipients may use grant funds to cover planning and development costs incurred while achieving program accreditation 204 Russell, DJ, et al. \"Family M edicine Residencies: How Rural Training Exposure in GME Is Associated With Subsequent Rural Practice,\" Journal of Graduate Medical Education, August 2022 . 366 through the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). The program began in FY 2018. Since FY 2018, the program has made new awards each fiscal year and HRSA plans a new competition for FY 2024. The RRPD grants have a three -year period of performance and are fully funded when issued to allow flexibility for the varied schedules necessary to develop new residency program s. Rural Residency Planning and Development Technical Assistance (RRPD -TA) funds one cooperative agreement that creates a technical assistance center to support RRPD grant applicants and recipients. The program began in FY 2018. Eligible entities inc lude domestic non -profit organizations with the capability to be national in scope to reflect the distribution of current and future RRPD cohorts. The most recent competition was in FY 2021 and the cooperative agreement has a five -year period of performanc e. Since program inception in FY 2018, the RRPD Program has issued 58 RRPD awards across four cohorts as well as continuous funding for technical assistance under RRPD -TA. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $12.7 million is $ 200,000 above t he FY 2023 Enacted level. With the FY 2024 Budget request, HRSA anticipates making 15 new 3 -year awards of $750,000 each under RRPD and providing additional support for technical assistance under RRPD -TA. The new awards and increased technical assistance w ill support new rural residency programs to train physicians in rural areas. The previous RRPD competitions generated significant interest from rural stakeholders and HRSA received more competitive applications than they were able to fund; HRSA anticipates similar interest in the FY 2024 competition. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Nine grant recipients from RRPD Cohort 1 (FY 2019) finished their period of performance in FY 2022 and all achieved Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accreditation as new rural residency programs. An additional 22 recipients have achieved ACGME accreditation ahead of schedule and are strengthening their new residency programs as they complete their period of performance. As of September 30, 2022, across all RRPD cohorts, 367 31 award recipients have achieved ACGME accreditation, for a total of 418 new approved residency positions at full complement in the following specialties: 24 New Family Medicine Residency Programs and 315 Residency Positions 5 New Psychiatry Medicine Residency Programs and 52 Residency Positions 1 New Internal M edicine Residency Program and 36 Residency Positions 1 New General Surgery Residency Program and 15 Residency Positions Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 Target FY 2024 Target FY 2024 +/- FY 6080.01 Percentage of Rural Residency Planning and Development grantees who achieve Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education accreditation by the end of the period of performance (Outcome) FY 2022: 100 % Target: Not Defined (Historical Actual) Not Defined 90% N/A Grant Awards Table FY FY 2024 President's Budget Awards 13 15 15 Average Award $749,845 $750,000 $750,000 Range of 21 21 --- Authorizing Legislation: Social Security Act, Section 711, as amended by Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Section 432, Public Law 108 -173. FY 2024 Authorization ............................................................................ Indefinite Allocation Metho d ................................

RCORP -Child and Adolescent Behavioral Health strengthens and expands behavioral health care services across the prevention, treatment, and recovery continuum for rural children and adolescents aged 5 -17 years. HRSA will support the continuation of approximately 9 awards in FY 2024. The RCORP -Rural Centers of Excellence on Substance Use Disorders program supports the dissemination of best practices related to the treatment for and prevention of substance use disorders within rural communities, with a focus on the current opioid crisis. The program was re -competed in FY 2023 with limited eligibilit y to continue $10 million in support of the three Centers of Excellence. HRSA will support the continuation of these 3 cooperative agreements in FY 2024. Rural Behavioral Health Workforce Centers develop and implement training and mentorship programs th at build the capacity of rural health care providers, paraprofessionals, non -clinical staff, and community members to care for individuals with behavioral health, including SUD/OUD, needs in rural locations within the Northern Border Regional Commission. H RSA will support the continuation of these 4 cooperative agreements in FY 2024. RCORP -Technical Assistance and Evaluation provide technical assistance and evaluation support encompassing the entire RCORP initiative. HRSA will support the continuation of funding for one technical assistance and one evaluation cooperative agreement in FY 2024. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $165 million is $20 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will support the development and continuatio n of community -based grant programs and technical assistance that provide needed behavioral health, including SUD/OUD, services to rural residents. Drug overdose death rate in rural areas rose from 19.6205 in 2019 to 26.2 per 100,000 standard population in 2020206 and over 60 percent of mental . 206https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db440.htm#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20rate%20of%2 0drug,in %20rur are located in rural areas.207 Through progress reports, listening sessions, and town halls, RCORP award recipients and other rural stakeholders have described continued workfor ce shortages, reimbursement issues, and the need for additional resources to address substances beyond opioids and co -occurring mental health disorders. This request will enable HRSA to continue expanding RCORP's focus to include other, emergent behavio ral health needs in rural communities. In FY 2023, HRSA piloted new programs that provided funds to rural communities to rapidly address their immediate SUD needs (including lifesaving naloxone) and address ed health equity . They also provided needed prevention, treatment, and recovery services to rural residents, including for children and adolescents , and pregnant and postpartum people. In FY 2024, HRSA plans to continue funding for these programs and existing cooperativ e agreements that provide technical assistance, evaluation, and workforce development support. Additionally, HRSA will support approximately 16 new awards aimed at building the capacity of rural health organizations to establish, implement, and sustain ne w behavioral health care, including SUD, service lines in rural areas. HRSA will also re -compete the RCORP -Overdose Response and RCORP -Psychostimulant Support awards for 52 awards, totaling 68 new awards in FY 2024. HRSA will continue to solicit feedback from rural stakeholders and engage and partner with other Federal agencies to promote a coordinated approach to combatting this devastating epidemic and ensure HRSA's efforts are aligned with Administration priorities. Finally, this request will enable H RSA to strengthen RCORP's commitment to reducing disparities in health outcomes and access among vulnerable populations. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information techn ology and other program support costs. Funding History Fiscal FY 2021, RCORP award recipients provided direct prevention, treatment, and recovery services to 2,050,439 rural individuals across the country, including medication -assisted treatment services to 112,456 rural individuals.208 Between September 1, 2021 and February 28, 207 https://data.hrsa.gov/Default/GenerateHPSAQuarterlyReport 208 Self-reported performance data submitted to HRSA by RCORP award recipients, covering the Septe -August 31, 2022 time period. 371 2022, approximately 45 percent of RCORP award recipients reported using RCORP funding to establish or expand access to prevention services in their communities; approximately 35 percent established or expanded harm reduction services; and approximately 43 percent established or expanded recovery support services.209 To increase the likelihood of sustaining these services and enhance community buy -in, RCORP award recipients have collectively engaged with approximately 2,800 state and local agencies and o rganizations representing a diverse array of sectors, including school systems, health centers, hospitals, law enforcement agencies, community -based organizations, and others to implement their programs.210 Finally, RCORP expanded the number of rural counti es served by the initiative from around 1,500 in FY 2021 to over 1,800 in FY 2022.

Indefinite Allocation Method Grants/Cooperative Agreement Program Description In FY 2024, the Rural Health Clinic Behavioral Health Initiative will provide funding support directly to Medicare -participating Rural Health Clinics (RHC) to expand access to behavioral health care services provided by the RHC. RHCs are key safety net providers for rural residents and serve as a vital link to primary and ambulatory care services in approximately 712 counties where there is no FQHC.212 This initiative targets ar eas where there is inadequate access to behavioral health services being provided. Long -standing systemic health and social inequities have put some rural residents at increased risk of having severe illness including behavioral health issues. Rural areas represent nearly 60 percent of Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas, encompassing more than 25 million people who do not have adequate access to mental health care providers.213 Over 13 percent of rural counties have no behavioral health care providers at all.214 Rural suicide rates outpace urban suicide rates, and this difference has continued to widen over time.215 Additionally, one in five rural residents identify with one of more of the following groups, Black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), Asian American/Pacific Islander (AA/PI), or mixed race. RHCs serve two -thirds of the majority - minority counties in the U.S., and provide essential services to populations that experience health disparities at a higher rate than people who identify as non -Hispanic White.216 This Initiative will focus on the rural areas where there are gaps in access to essential behavioral health care services. RHCs are an underutilized critical health care resource for rural communities and through this RHC Behavi oral Health Initiative will be able to provide them the ability to address service delivery gaps by receiving targeted financial resources and technical assistance. 212 HRSA analysis of 2021 CMS Provider of Services data 213 Designated HPSA Quarterly Summary, 2020 214 WWAMI, 2019 215 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db373.htm 216 National Association of Rural Health Clinics 374 Less than 10 percent of RHCs employ either a social worker and/or psychologist. To addres s this inequity, RHCs funded through this program will utilize grant funds to cover the salary of a behavioral health provider, address provider burnout by supporting the resilience and mental well-being of providers, and expand the availability of service s such as mental health and substance use disorder screenings, counseling, and therapy. This program will also afford RHCs the ability to build up the volume of their behavioral health patient base and enhance their billing and coding practices to ensure r evenue from these vital health care services, which will allow these activities to sustain beyond the three -year grant program. This short -term investment allows for long -term impact, with sustainability from Federal funds a key tenet of this program. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $10 million is $10 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. The request will fund approximately 12 awardees up to $750,000 for a three -year period of performance. The RHCs will work to establish new and expanded behavioral health care service lines and adding providers within their RHCs to increase access, beginning in year one. Award recipients will further be anticipated to be able to expand access in additional rural communities in years two and three by furt her establishing and/or expanding services within additional RHCs beyond those that were included in year one. This funding is necessary to allow RHCs to build access to critical behavioral health care services in rural communities where those services do not currently exist. This initiative will result in an increase in the number of rural residents who receive behavioral health care services, the number of behavioral health care professionals in rural communities, and the number of RHCs that are able to b ill for and sustain behavioral health care services. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

The intended outcome o f the Rural Health Clinic Initiative is to ensure RHCs remain equipped to provide high quality, accessible health care services to rural residents across the United States. The estimated outcome of this program is to support the integration of mental health services into existing primary care services at RHCs and increase the availability of mental health services in rural communities. 376 Grant Awards Table FY 2022 Final FY 2023 Enacted FY 2024 President's Budget Number of Awards --- --- 12 Average Award --- --- $750,000 Range of Awards --- --- $50,000 - $750,000 377 The Financial and Community Sustainability for At -Risk Rural Hospitals FY 2022 Final --- --- 2 +2 Authorizing Legislation: Social Security Act, Section 711, as amended by 21st Century Cures Act, Sections 2012 , 2013 , 2035, and 2043, Public Law .............................................................................Indefinite Allocation Method ................................ ..................... Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreement Program Description The FY 2024 Financial and Community Sustainability for At -Risk Rural Hospitals Program will target technical assistance to rural hospitals severely at -risk for imminent closure and struggling to maintain health care services. Small rural hospitals are often the only health care available in rural counties, and populations most affected by hospital closings tend to be poor, minoritie s and elderly patients with chronic health conditions.217 There have been 143 rural hospital closures from 2010 through January 2023, peaking with a high of 19 in 2020 just as pandemic hit. Closures are happening more often in communities of color. Histor ically, about half of the closures result in a complete loss of services at those facilities. The pandemic response programs resulted in a much smaller number of closures, only nine rural hospitals closed in 2021 and 2022, as the infusion of funding helped stabilize rural hospital finances. As that funding ends, the factors that can lead to closures continue to impact rural hospitals, such as market consolidation, population loss, and insurance payer mix. HHS - supported research indicates that long term pres sures on rural hospitals may put many rural hospitals at higher risk of financial distress as pandemic relief funds are exhausted. Rural hospitals are also likely to see higher uncompensated care costs as patients lose Medicaid coverage once the Public He alth Emergency ends and pandemic -related enrollment in public insurance drops. There are also concerns rural hospitals will face additional challenges due to the added burden of higher workforce costs and staffing losses during the pandemic. This program supports a mechanism to help these at -risk facilities through targeted technical assistance and give them a path forward. Hospitals experiencing high financial distress often reduce services, limiting access for vulnerable populations and exacerbating he alth disparities. Consequently, providing assistance to hospitals and communities will help to keep some services local, leading to improved access and 217 Thomas, SR, Pink, GH, Reiter, K. Characteristics of Communities Served by Rural Hospitals Predicted to be at High Risk of Financial Distress in 2019. NC Rural Health Research Program. April 2019. https://www.ruralhealthresearch.org/publications/1252 378 improved health outcomes. Before the pandemic, research indicated that almost 19% of rural hospitals in the South were at high risk of financial distress, a much higher proportion than other Census regions where slightly more than 4% of rural hospitals were at high risk of financial distress. This program will work communities nationwide to provide intensiv e, short -term technical assistance to hospitals struggling with challenges that threaten access to health care in a rural community. The targeted technical assistance will focus on those sites that are essential access points in particularly vulnerable rur al communities facing imminent closure. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request of $10 million is $10 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level to provide emergency targeted, in -depth high quality technical assistance to rural hospitals within rural com munities severely at -risk for imminent closure and struggling to maintain health care services. The request will fund approximately one national technical assistance center includes and other administrative costs. This program builds on HRSA's experience funding the Vulnerable Rural Hospital Assistance Program and the Delta Region Community Health Systems Development Program. The Delta program focuses solely on that geographic region of the country, leaving out other areas where hospitals may be at high ri sk. The Vulnerable Rural Hospital Program targets facilities projected to be at medium risk. However, resources and rapid response capabilities do not currently exist for severely distressed rural hospitals who need immediate technical assistance. The F inancial and Community Sustainability for At -Risk Rural Hospitals Program is designed to respond to immediate need where a failure to offer support would likely result in closure. This increase is necessary to ensure critical health care services remain a vailable within rural communities.

Since 2010, more than 143 rural hospitals have closed. More than two -thirds of rural hospitals have 50 beds or less and have seen steadily decreasing inpatient utilization. These facilities tend to have low service volume and high fixed costs, creating ongoing structural challenges in terms of remaining financially viable. Though rural hospitals may be serving small populations, they need to ensure that they are able to retain as many local patients as possible to increase volume, there by billing for more services and increasing revenue that improves their financial viability. Unfortunately, rural hospitals often face situations in which some local patients seek services at other facilities, resulting in lost potential revenue. Re search funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) shows the negative financial impact of bypass as rural hospitals miss out on health care services that could be provided by the local facility are instead spent at more distant facilities.218 The program, which would work with approximately 25 hospitals a year, would produce market assessments of participating hospitals to assess gaps in services and those clinical areas where expansion would meet local need and generate additional service vo lume to improve financial operations for the participating hospital. These facilities would receive start -up capital to enhance existing service lines and start new services lines to ensure services are retained locally. The program would cover expenses for minor renovation, new salary costs, equipment acquisition and promotion of the new services. Examples would include adding services such as pulmonary rehabilitation, infusion/chemotherapy, inpatient psychiatric services, outpatient behavioral health s ervices, obstetric services, cardiac rehabilitation and expanded primary -hospital -bypass -outpatient -services.pdf ; https://www.cms.gov/files/document/ruralhospitalbypassfinalreport.pdf ; https://www.cms.gov/files/document/hospitalbypassamongmedicaredatahighlightsept2020.pdf 381 The funding would also work with rural hospitals to identify and move into those services areas that are linked to broader public health needs such as behavioral health, mater nity care and those services that could help rural hospitals reduce disparities identified by the CDC in the five leading causes of avoidable or excess death.219 The program would also track the number of hospitals that were able to implement new service lines or enhance existing services lines and the collective growth in patient volume as indicators of success. This would have the added effect of helping these facilities address long -standing rural disparities while also enhancing their financial viability by increasing service volume. HRSA would develop a n annual report detailing the status of the hospitals assisted and the communities they serve . Budget Req uest The FY 2024 Budget Request of $20 million is $20 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. This pilot program would provide market assessments of participating hospitals to assess gaps in services and those clinical areas where expansion would meet local need and generate additional service volume for the participating hospital. This program would assist hospitals in stabilizing and enhancing health care service lines in their communities. The funding would also work with rural hospitals to identif y and move into those services areas that are linked to broader public health needs such as behavioral health, maternity care and those services that could help rural hospitals reduce disparities identified by the CDC in the five leading causes of avoidabl e or excess death. The request will fund approximately three regional technical assistance centers to work with at - risk rural hospitals. The request also includes other administrative costs to support the service - line expansion.

FY 2024 Authorization..............................................................................Indefinite Allocation Method...................................................................................... ..Other Program Description To achieve its mission, HRSA requires qualified staff to operate at maximum efficiency. One of HRSA's goals is to strengthen program management and operations by improving program customer satisfaction, increasing employee engagement, and implementing organizational improvements and innovative projects. Program Management is the primary means of support for staff, business operations and processes, information technology and overhead expenses such as rent, utilities, and miscellaneous charges for HRSA. Numerous efforts are underway to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the agency and to ensure the workforce is positioned to succeed in the 21st century. HRSA relies on HHS - provided shared services for many of the services, such as human resources, f inancial management, grants, and procurement. HRSA actively seeks out and deploys shared services to improve and simplify processes, and to maximize the efficiency of shared services with other components of HHS. Program Management also supports Enterpris e Risk Management (ERM) activities that align with core principles and performance and strategic planning activities to reduce programmatic risk and improve performance. HRSA has established a HRSA -wide governance structure for enterprise -wide business ope rations and risk management activities to ensure a proactive and customer -focused suite of business operation services and risk management functions. HRSA's ERM efforts include Governance and Process support for the promotion of a risk -aware organizational culture, the creation of a comprehensive view of risks to drive strategic decision making and the establishment and communication of risk appetite. 385 Budget Reques t The FY 2024 Request of $169 million is $5.2 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. Thi s funding level supports program management activities to effectively and efficiently support HRSA's operations. HRSA is committed to improving quality at a lower cost and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of government operations. HRSA supports telework by increasing the agency -wide utilization of web collaboration tools, which have led to greater business productivity. HRSA also continues to enhance its program integrity activities by supporting analytical tools using HRSA's electronic grants system, program data, Office of Federal Assistance Management data sources, HHS sources, and government -wide sources. The goal is for HRSA to identify potential issues in the pre - and post -award processes and to address issues before they become audit fin dings. HRSA plans to focus on a risk -based approach to grantee monitoring using the information and corresponding analysis to help staff spend their time on grantees at risk of noncompliance. HRSA will also continue to provide training for grants managem ent and program staff to support the alignment of program integrity initiatives with planning and performance activities. These efforts will enhance HRSA grantees awareness and ability to avoid potential financial integrity issues. Funding History: Fiscal Year Improving Processes and Business Operations HRSA continues to improve operational processes to maximize efficiencies. In FY 2022, HRSA implemented multiple workflow automation (robotic/Bot) processes to increase efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness of operations projects. These include: 1) five b ots to support daily activities with budget execution and reconciliation for Provider Relief funds; 2) a bot to support management reporting on human resources and space management by pulling data from HRSA employee telework agreements; and 3) a bot to sup port contract specialists in the contract closeout process. Developing a 21st Century Workforce The hiring process has been streamlined, reducing the time it takes to complete the hiring cycle from recruitment to onboarding, which has resulted in enhanced program oversight and integrity, and increased effectiveness and efficiency of the recruitment process. These improvements supported the efficient hiring of 385 new HRSA staff in FY 2022, which is a major feat to 386 accomplish while also successfully navigat ing unique hiring requests to support the COVID -19 pandemic and the monkeypox public health emergency. HRSA is also focused on intense employee engagement improvement efforts. For 7 years in a row, HRSA has had the highest EVS response rate in HHS, nearl y 82 percent. HRSA leaders prioritized employee engagement and well -being, holding monthly all hands meetings and regular listening sessions allowing leaders to engage employees at all levels, and gain feedback to inform decision making. HRSA also achieved the highest contractor performance assessment reporting system rating among HHS OPDIVs with a score of 98.2 percent. HRSA conducted an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) self -assessment by convening a core team of HRSA leaders to use the Council of Inspecto rs General on Integrity and Efficiency's Inspectors General Guide to Assessing Enterprise Risk Management. The assessment found that HRSA has a solid governance structure for internal controls, payment integrity and ERM and that it has developed a comprehe nsive Risk Profile and Portfolio of Risks, through engaging governance board members in thoughtful discussion and rating of risks. IT Investments Significant progress has been made in a range of IT investments. In FY 2022, HRSA successfully transitioned t he majority of the workforce from remote work to hybrid work schedules, while adapting to changing environments and workplace requirements. HRSA continuously works to enhance employees IT end -user support by enhancing collaboration platforms, including imp lementing a SharePoint hoteling space system. HRSA continues to utilize Microsoft Teams to provide a feature rich collaboration platform that provides audio/video calling and conferencing, chat, and file sharing all in a secure environment. HRSA piloted s everal hybrid virtual meeting technology improvements to enhance the collaborative space, including Zoom Rooms. In FY 2022, HRSA deployed a pilot Snowflake data cloud to enable secure data sharing and support high volume data processing of Provider Relief Fund and Uninsured Program records, a Provider Relief Fund Reconsideration case management system, and enhanced multiple other reporting and case management systems to maximize efficiencies. These systems maximized program efficiency and increased program integrity by creating interactive dashboards for call centers and executive reporting The systems also improved application portal capabilities and audit reporting. HRSA is also prioritizing the implementation of Zero Trust Strategy in support of the Administration's goals regarding Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles220.HRSA continues to improve HRSA IT security in cident prevention, detection and response capabilities by improving penetration testing capabilities and deploying Crowdstrike on all IT assets. 220 https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp -content/uploads/2022/01/M -22-09.pdf 387 Outputs and Outcomes Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 Target FY 2024 Target Infrastructure Protection: Security Authorization to Operate: Percentage of HRSA information systems assessed and Authorized to Operate (ATO) (Output) FY 2022: 100% Target: Protection: Sprint (Output) FY 2022: < 30 days Target: 30 days (Target Met) 30 days Discontinued N/A 35.VII.B.2c Ensure Critical Infrastructure Protection: Security Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) or Privacy Threshold Assessment (PTA) (Output) FY 2022: 100% Target: Identify 95% of systems that require a PIA or a Privacy Threshold Assessment (PTA) (Target Met) 90% Discontinued N/A 388 Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2023 Target FY 2024 Target phishing campaigns completed (Output) FY 24 24 (Target Met) 24 Discontinued N/A 7010.03 Enterprise Architecture: Percentage of IT systems reported to OMB with mapping to at least one HHS segment and domain (Output) FY Infrastructure Protection: Average annual overall score for HRSA IT Systems on the HRSA -wide Capital Planning and Investment Control Office of Pharmacy Affairs/340B Drug Pricing FY 2022 23 --- Authorizing Legislation: Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Section 340B, as amended by Public Law 111 -309, Section 204 FY 2024 Authorization .................................................................................SSAN Allocation Method ................................ ................................ ................................ .............. Contract Program Description The 340B Program requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts on outpatient prescription drugs to certain safety net health care providers specified in statute, known as covered entities, such as Federally Qualified Health Centers, Children's Hospitals , Critical Access Hospitals, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Grantees, and certain disproportionate share hospitals. HRSA is responsible for administering the 340B program and providing oversight, including conducting audits of covered entities and manufactur ers. The 340B ceiling price - the maximum amount a drug manufacturer can charge a covered entity for a given drug - is equal to the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) minus the Unit Rebate Amount, both set by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CM S). The 340B statute also includes the establishment of a Prime Vendor Program (PVP) to develop, maintain, and coordinate a program capable of facilitating distribution of covered outpatient drugs. Budget Request The FY 2024 President's Budget req uest of $17.2 million is $5 million above FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will support implementation of 340B Program statutory obligations, oversight of participating manufacturers and covered entities, operational improvements, and policy needs, and increased ef ficiencies using information technology. The FY 2024 budget request provides resources for the 340B Program to educate participating covered entities and prospective sites on compliance with statutory requirements. For participating covered ent ities, HRSA will continue to expand its oversight and compliance activities. HRSA will continue to conduct audits of manufacturers, which should not only increase compliance, but also guide future technical assistance. PVP data shows education based on o versight measures reduces the risk of future compliance issues. The request supports facilitation of refunds and credits to entities that are overcharged by participating manufacturers as well as enhancements to the Pricing Component of the 340B Office of Pharmacy Affairs Information System (OPAIS), which is where covered 390 entities access 340B ceiling price information via a secure website to provide transparency of data to authorized users. System implementation began in calendar year 2019, and prices hav e been available to covered entities, after review and validation, since April 1, 2019. System improvements are continuously made to improve the user interface for HRSA, manufacturers, and the covered entities. HRSA also makes improvements to the system to support program needs and system reliability. HRSA will continue to implement improvements to the Administrative Dispute Resolution process. In addition, HRSA will enhance IT system capabilities to support the handling and resolution of claims. Final ly, HRSA will increase the audit and oversight functions, including additional manufacturer and covered entities audits. The FY 2024 Budget Request proposes to enhance 340B Program integrity by requiring covered entities to annually report to HRSA how t he savings achieved through the Program benefits the communities they serve and provide HRSA regulatory authority to implement this requirement. HRSA also proposes explicit regulatory authority to define necessary terms. HRSA is also proposing to strengt hen compliance and transparency related to the utilization of contract pharmacies. The FY 2024 Budget Request for budget authority includes program support costs associated with contract award processes, follow -up reviews, information technology and prog ram support. Funding History Fiscal Year Accomplishments HRSA places a high priority on the integrity of the 340B Program and continually works to improve Program oversight. HRSA conducts the following activities to ensure both covered entities and manufacturers are in compliance with program requirements: Performs initial eligibility checks of all entities seeking to register with the Program. Recertifies covered entities annually including an attestation to compliance with all Program requirements. Performs audits of covered entities to assure compliance within the Program. Since FY 2012, HRSA completed 1,916 covered entity audits, which included review of associated offsite outpatient facilities and contract pharmacies. Final audit results, including statuses of corrective actions, are available on HRSA's website. Reviews every non -compliance allegation received through targeted communication and, if necessary, performs on -site audits. 391 Performs audits of manufacturers. Since FY 2015, HRSA finalized 36 audits of manufacturers. Provides assistance to covered entities that self -disclose compliance issues, including developing corrective action plans and working with affected manufacturers. Supports an integrated system of compliance tracking for covered entities and manufacturers, enabling enhanced co mmunication to ensure that all covered entities and manufacturers are in compliance with 340B program requirements. Publishes verified ceiling prices of covered outpatient drugs available for purchase under the 340B Program on a quarterly basis in the 34 0B OPAIS, Pricing Component. Most recently, quickly implemented Section 121 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 which established an eligibility exception for certain hospitals that were or would be terminated from the program due to inability t o meet the statutorily -required disproportionate share adjustment (or DSH) percentage), due to impacts of the COVID - 19 public health emergency and other criteria.

The Telehealth Hub was originally funded through the CARES Act. HRSA continues to provide important up -to-date telehealth, licensure, and broadband resources for the public. The Telehealth Hub 395 had nearly 5 million views since it was launched in April 2020, and it has been expanded to include licensure resources to support those needing assistance with interstate licensure. It also features a research section that links to HHS -supported telehealth research studies that serves as HHS's telehealth research gateway. o Telehealth.HHS.gov Promotional Campaign will allow for the continued dissemination of critical telehealth resources for patients, providers, and states through Telehealt h.HHS.gov as telehealth reimbursement and policies continue to evolve since the COVID -19 pandemic. The promotional campaign was originally funded through the CARES Act, and it will continue to support the dissemination of the evolving telehealth policies a nd resources through Telehealth.HHS.gov. Telehealth Data Collection Infrastructure will track funding, projects, and data for telehealth services within HRSA. This project will result in a telehealth data assessment for fully usable data solutions, polic ies, and procedures to increase quality and standards of telehealth data for HRSA. It will provide a systematic way of capturing data from programs and activities within OAT and HRSA that could help inform overall performance of award recipients and their outcomes and could be expanded HHS -wide to increase the sharing of telehealth data across HHS and with the public. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth of $44.5 million is $6.5 million above the FY 2023 Enacted Level. HRSA will continue to utilize telehealth to provide access to healthcare in rural and underserved areas. In FY 2024, HRSA will support the continuation of 38 existing grantees, and 27 new competitive grants to strengthen the networks and the technical assistance providers that support effective implementation of telehealth services. The Telehealth Network Grant Program and Licensure Portability Grant Program will be re -competed in FY 2024. The $6.5 million increase will fund the continua tion of the HHS Telehealth Hub, which includes Telehealth.hhs.gov and the corresponding promotional contract for Telehealth.hhs.gov, which allow for the rapid dissemination of critical telehealth resources for patients, providers, states, researchers, and other stakeholders through Telehealth.HHS.gov. In addition, the increase will fund a contract for the Telehealth Data Collection Infrastructure, which is critical in allowing HRSA to track funding, projects, and data for telehealth services within HRSA. F unding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs 396 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Supplemental Funding FY Budget $44,500,000 --- Program Accomplishments The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth had several accomplishments through its program activities and collaborative efforts. The current Telehealth Network Grant Program for emergency services, which will end in FY 2024, promotes rural tele -emergen cy services by enhancing telehealth networks to deliver 24 -hour Emergency Department (ED) consultation services via telehealth to rural providers without emergency care specialists. In the most recent reporting cycle, this program has served approximately 13,000 patients. In addition, the EB -TNP for Direct - to-Consumer services served approximately 9,000 patients. The TRCs have provided over 6,000 technical assistance requests to assist providers with implementing telehealth and understanding evolving telehealth policy. In addition, the National Telehealth Technology Assessment Resource Center, continues to impleme nt HRSA's Telehealth Broadband Pilot Program, which now has over 350 broadband measurement devices within the four target states - Alaska, Michigan, Texas, and West Virginia \u2014that have resulted in over 290,000 bandwidth tests. The Telehealth Centers of E xcellence have contributed to the evidence -base for telehealth with over 20 published articles to date on topics such as telehealth costs and utilization and remote patient monitoring. The Telehealth Technology -Enabled Learning Program recipients held n early 3,000 provider -to-provider learning sessions with rural primary care providers focusing on issues such as behavioral health and Long COVID. Through the Licensure Portability Grant Program, grantees developed tools such as the Provider Bridge to pr ovide key information for health care professionals across various disciplines, with over 145,000 providers registered to use the platform. The HHS Telehealth Hub, through the Telehealth.hhs.gov and Telehealth.hhs.gov promotional campaign, had nearly 5 mi llion views since its launch. The website provides 397 resources and information in English and Spanish. It was also included in the White House Fact Sheet on Maternal Health in 2022 as well as the State of the Union Fact Sheet in 2023. Supported by Telehealt h.hhs.gov, OAT hosted its first virtual National Telehealth Conference in 2022, with nearly 4,000 registered participants and over 50 speakers covering a wide range of topics from behavioral health to broadband to licensure portability and more. OAT has a lso led efforts to coordinate telehealth activities across HRSA and HHS by leading the annual telehealth inventory for HRSA activities, an HHS data call for telehealth research, and keeping the federal workforce informed on the latest telehealth issues by convening a Federal Telehealth Workgroup (FedTel).

As such, measure results will vary from year -to-year due to expected turnover in grantee cohorts and focus areas, and target s will need to be evaluated on an ongoing basis. In addition, the data represents results from FY 2021 funding and was collected between September 2021 through August 2022, aligning with the program funding period. The targets for FY 2024 have been establ ished based on the current cohorts for both the Telehealth Network Grant program for emergency services and the Evidence -Based Telehealth Network program for Direct -to-Consumer services. The Telehealth Resource Center (TRC) program measure (6070.04), rep resents results from FY 2021 funding and was collected between September 2021 through August 2022, aligning with the program funding period. These results will vary based on the need for telehealth -related technical assistance from providers as well as fu nding for the program. The target for FY 2024 has been established based on level funding for the TRC program, which can affect TRC's capacity in providing technical assistance. Grant Awards Table FY 2022 Final FY 2023 Enacted FY 2024 President's Budget Awards 70 70 65 Average Award $431,919 $478,700 $500,110 Range of -operative agreement Contracts Program Description: According to the CDC, Long COVID, which is defined as experiencing new symptoms lasting three or more months after first contracting COVID -19, has occurred in 1 in 13 (7.5%) adults in the United States221. Populations affected by health inequities, including people from racial or ethnic minority groups and people with disabilities, are at increased risk of Long COVID. Some of these patients will need ongoing support as they ma nage the multifaceted clinical impacts of these extended symptoms. HRSA's Long COVID program supports the Administration's goals and memorandum directing an action plan on Long COVID222 by providing holistic, integrated support to patients who are diagnosed with Long COVID, with a focus on reaching uninsured, low income, and racial and ethnic minority populations who have suffered disproportionately from the COVID pandemic in the U.S. Th is program will increase capacity in states to provide clinical care to patients with Long COVID, including the expansion of services for uninsured and underinsured patients, by enhancing integrated multispecialty assessment for the most complex patients a nd providing support to primary care providers who will care for a majority of patients presenting with Long COVID symptoms. This new program integrates treatment and research and thus supports the White House memorandum directing action to be taken in su pport of research on Long COVID. 221 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220622.htm 400 The HRSA Long COVID Support Program will have two components: to fund integrated sub - specialty services for people with Long COVID; and to train and increase capacity for primary care providers who will provide much of the front -line care. First, HRSA will provide funding to states, or a non -profit if the state decides to not apply, to implement or enhance Long COVID Integrated Diagnostics and Care Units for referral of the most complex patients. This will include support of uninsured or low income patients to access services in these Long COVID Integrated Diagnostics and Care Units . Second, HRSA will fund provider training, capacity building, and consultation to support primary care physicians who will provide services fo r a majority of patients with Long COVID . Eligible Entities: All States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands will be eligible to apply for the Long COVID Integrated Diagnostics and Care Units funding with non-profits eligible to apply if a state decides to not apply . Nonprofit organizations may apply for the training and capacity building component. Budget Request: The FY 2024 Budget Request is $130 million for this new program. Funding will provide support to patients diagnosed with Long COVID. This funding will support: 1) integrated specialty care to those patients with the most complex needs, including the acces s to these specialized services for uninsured and underinsured patients; and 2) training, capacity building, and consultation services to primary care providers who will provide a majority of Long COVID care. a. Long COVID Integrated Diagnostics and Care Un its: $100 million to support approximately 53 awards to states at an average amount of $1.9 million per award for Long COVID Integrated Diagnostics and Care Units throughout the country to provide integrated multispecialty evaluation and care for patients with Long COVID, including through telemedicine. The specialties would include such areas as pulmonary medicine, neurology, cardiology, mental health services, physical rehabilitation, case management, and occupational therapy. The Long COVID Integrated Di agnostics and Care Units would be required to document processes to integrate assessments and treatment plans across specialists and primary care. The funding would include enhancing existing Units in states in addition to providing funding for uninsured and low income patients to access services through these units. These Long COVID Integrated Diagnostics and Care Units would be associated with NIH funded clinical trial networks to efficiently translate the latest research advances into clinical practic e and to give patients opportunities to participate in clinical trials to increase their access to emerging therapies. They would also be associated with the AHRQ proposed grants to study how to develop and implement new or improved care delivery models wi thin multidisciplinary Long COVID clinics and quickly translate lessons learned to the HRSA funded clinical programs. 401 Funding will also support staffing and administrative costs, including an evaluation to study the effectiveness of the program. b. Provider Training, Capacity Building, and Consultation : $30 million to support approximately 11 awards at an average amount of $2.7 million per award to nonprofit entities for provider training, capacity building, and consultation for primary care provider s. Recipients would provide web -based and regionally based training to primary care providers to increase their knowledge of Long COVID diagnostics and treatment; an ECHO model to increase capacity of clinical sites and clinicians; and a consultation cen ter to support clinicians across the country in the assessment and management of Long COVID through telephone and e -consultation. Funding will also support staffing and administrative costs, including an evaluation to study the effectiveness of the progr am.

Enacted in 1970 as part of the Public Health Service Act, the mission of the Title X Program is to assist individuals and families in determining the number and spacing of children and to provide access to voluntary family planning methods, services, and information to all who want and need them. Title X authorizing legislation requires that proj ects provide a broad range of effective and acceptable family planning methods and services, including fertility awareness -based methods, infertility services, and services for adolescents. By law, priority is given to persons from low -income families. T he Title X Program is administered by the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH). Advancing equity for all, including people from low -income families, people of color, and others who have been histori cally underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality, is a priority for the Department, for OASH/OPA, and for the Title X Program. Grantees, subrecipients, and service sites funded by the Title X Program work to ensure that the predominantly low -income clients, who rely on Title X services as their usual source of medical care, have access to the same quality healthcare, including full medical information and referrals, that higher -income clients and clients with pri vate insurance are able to access. Key strategies for advancing equity include removing barriers to accessing services, improving the quality of services, and providing client -centered services. 404 Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the Title X Family Planning Program of $512 million is $226 million above the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will fund family planning services for approximately 4.5 million individuals, with 90% having family incomes a t or below 250% of the federal poverty level. The additional funds will allow for strategic planning, coordination, and evaluation of demonstration grants to test innovative approaches that support efforts to achieve health equity, including sexual and re productive health equity, and improved health outcomes for medically underserved populations that rely on Title X as a primary point -of-entry into the healthcare system. By focusing on promising strategies that address an array of the drivers of social de terminants of health in the service delivery setting, safety -net providers and the broader public health community will have a larger body of evidence and tested approaches to deliver quality care and support using a comprehensive, integrated approach that centers the lived experiences of the systems' clients. With the increase in funding, OPA will: - Provide additional funding to Title X service providers to increase the number of clients receiving Title X services. - Fund states, territories, tribes, and communities to develop and implement demonstration grants that: o advance a multidimensional approac h to address social determinants of health within Title X family planning settings, o identify value -based payment models for future utilization by Title X providers; and o improve access to quality family planning services through telehealth utilizing consist ent data collection methods for FPAR reporting. - Develop a research agenda to advance integrated approaches to sexual and reproductive health equity and fund research projects designed to advance the research agenda. - Support training initiatives that foc us on applying a health equity framework in Title X service delivery. - Fund national organizations to support a comprehensive, integrated approach to addressing social determinants of health in safety -net healthcare delivery through Title X. - Support commu nication and dissemination of findings from family planning, sexual, and reproductive health data, research, programs and services. - Coordinate interagency efforts to advance patient -centered performance measures on sexual and reproductive health equity and align those measures with payment. The FY 2024 Budget Request will also allow the program to continue providing training and technical assistance to grantees, including supporting the operation of the Reproductive Health National Training Center and the National Clinical Training Center for Family Planning. OPA is increasing its focus on access, equity, and quality through a number of programmatic activities to support Title X projects. In FY 2024, OPA will continue to update the Quality Family Planning guidelines, the nationally recognized standards of care that define quality in a family planning visit. In addition, OPA is continuing to stress the importance of restoring and expanding access to quality services, leveraging community -based education and o utreach and telehealth to assist individuals and families with effective family planning services and related preventive healthcare services. 405 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Accomplishments The Title X Program fulfills its mission through awarding competitive grants to public and private nonprofit organizations. According to the 2021 Family Planning Annual Report (FPAR) data (the most recent data available), in 2021 Title X services were provided through a nationwide network of 3,284 community -based sites that provided clinical and educational services to 1,662,466 persons. As a resul t of the provision of a broad range of effective and acceptable family planning methods, counseling and education, and other clinical services, the Title X Program was responsible for the prevention of an estimated 357,430 unintended pregnancies. Title X also plays an essential role in helping to prevent and treat sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In 2021, Title X service sites tested 741,278 female and male clients for chlamydia; 861,930 for gonorrhea; 403,492 for syphilis; and 487,995 confidential tests for HIV. Of the confidential HIV tests performed, 1,439 were positive for HIV. In October 2021, the Department finalized rulemaking to revise the regulations (effective November 8, 2021) that govern the Title X Family Planning Program (authorized by Title X of the Public Health Service Act) by readopting the 2000 regulations (65 FR 4 1270), with several revisions to ensure access to equitable, affordable, client -centered, quality family planning services for all clients, especially for low -income clients. In April 2022, OPA restored Title X services nationwide for the first time sinc e 2019. There is now at least one Title X services grantee in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Federated State of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. The Title X funded clinics are focused on advancing health equity through the delivery of Title X services, bolstering access to Title X services for all who need them, and ensuring delivery of Title X services of the highest quality a nd aligned with nationally recognized standards of care. In addition to restoring Title X services nationwide, OPA plans to launch FPAR 2.0 in 2023 to allow for encounter -level data collection of Title X systems. Focusing on better data collection will i ncrease the ability to drive policy and report on the outputs and outcomes of Title X projects and the overall program. OPA funds several family planning research projects to expand our understanding of best practices and promising strategies to advance equity, bolster access, and improve quality of 406 family planning services. OPA continues to provide training and technical assistance support for all staff, including clinical service providers, working in Title X clinics through the Reproductive Health Na tional Training Center and the National Clinical Training Center for Family Planning.

FY2021: $438 Target: $371 (Target not met) 371 Discontinued N/A Performance Narrative OPA funded 90 Title X service grantees at the beginning of FY 2019. Following implementation of the Title X Final Rule in FY 2019, 19 grantees discontinued participating in the Title X Program, and another 18 grantees reported significant losses to their service networks. OPA funded an additional five Title X grantees in FY 2020; however, there remained six states (HI, ME, OR, UT, VT, and WA) without any Title X services available and another seven states (AK, CT, IL, MA, MN, NH, and NY) with Title X serv ices available on a very limited basis. This resulted in Title X serving fewer clients and therefore not meeting the performance targets for 2019, 2020, and 2021. In October 2021, HHS finalized rulemaking to revise the regulations (effective November 8, 2021) that govern the Title X family planning program (authorized by Title X of the Public Health Service Act). Then, in April 2022, OPA competed all Title X service delivery funds and funded 78 grantees, who are restoring Title X services nationwide. O PA anticipates these newly funded Title X grantees will increase the total number of clients served. The increases in total number of clients served, however, are not expected to be evident until the 2022 FPAR data, which will not be available until late 2023. The targets for FY 2024 assume other sources of revenue that contribute to the family planning program at the grantee level will remain at current levels, including Medicaid, state and local government programs, other federal, state, and private gra nts, and private insurance. Measures 8000.03, 8000.04, and 8000.06 have been discontinued to better align with the program mission and available data. Measure 8000.05 has been reworded for accuracy and to align with the new sexually transmitted infecti on measures. Baselines are not yet available for new measures. 409 Grants Awards Table FY 2022 Final FY 2023 Enacted FY 2024 President's Budget Awards 78 78 100 Average Award $3,323,078 $3,323,078 $3,323,078 Range of $15,400,000 $200,000 - $15,400,000 of Division G of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 Allocation Method................................................Direct Federal, Competitive Contract Program Description The Nonrecurring Expenses Fund (NEF) permits HHS to transfer unobligated bal ances of expired discretionary funds from FY 2008 and subsequent years into the NEF account.

In FY 2024, HRSA will grant approximat ely 1,500 new awards to clinicians who are combating the opioid crisis in rural and underserved communities. 442 Addiction Medicine Fellowship Program FY 2024 President's Budget request: $25 million (level with the FY 2023 enacted level) The AMF Program seeks to increase the number of board certified addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry specialists trained in providing interprofessional behavioral health services, including OUD and SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery services, in unders erved, community -based settings. The AMF Program is designed to foster robust community -based clinical training of addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry physicians in underserved, community -based settings who see patients at various access points of c are and provide addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery services across healthcare sectors. In FY 2024, funding will support continuation awards to AMF grantees. Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Loan Repayment Program FY 2024 Presiden t's Budget request: $40 million (level with the FY 2023 enacted level) The STAR LRP provides for the repayment of educational loans for individuals working in a full-time SUD treatment job that involves direct patient care in either a mental Health Profes sional Shortage Area or a county where the overdose death rate exceeds the national average. The STAR LRP complements the NHSC SUD Workforce LRP as it is able to award loan repayment to more provider types and at a broader range of site types that those th at are eligible for the NHSC SUD Workforce LRP. In FY 2024, HRSA will grant approximately 160 new awards to eligible providers. Rural Communities Opioid Response Program FY 2024 President's Budget request: $165 million ($20 million over the FY 2023 en acted level) The RCORP initiative aims to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with SUD, including opioid use disorder (OUD), in high need rural communities by establishing, expanding, and sustaining prevention, treatment, and recovery services a t the county, state, and/or regional levels. Since RCORP's inception in FY 2018, the program has invested over $500 million in grants and technical assistance to rural communities serving more than 1,800 counties across 47 states and two territories. The most recent full -year of performance measurement data collection shows that a cohort of FY 2021 RCORP grantees provided direct SUD/OUD prevention, treatment, and recovery services to over 2 million rural residents, and ensured that 112,456 rural residents received medication assisted treatment (MAT) services. In FY 2024, HRSA will support the following continuing grant and cooperative agreement programs through RCORP: RCORP -Behavioral Health Care Support provides support to rural communities to respond to new and ongoing behavioral health needs of rural residents at risk for, or 443 diagnosed with, SUD/OUD and/or co -occurring disorders. The program focuses on building the infrastructural capacity of rural communities to deliver behavioral health, including SU D/OUD, services across the continuum; enhancing care coordination to provide effective care; and addressing social determinants of health to promote health equity. In FY 2024, HRSA will support the continuation of grants awarded in FY 2022. RCORP -Medicat ion Assisted Treatment Access provides support to establish new MAT access points and increase the capacity for sustainable MAT service provision in rural areas that do not currently have access to MAT for SUD/OUD. In FY 2024, HRSA will support the contin in FY 2022 and 2023. RCORP -Rural Centers of Excellence on Substance Use Disorders support the dissemination of best practices related to the treatment for and prevention of substance use disorders within rural communities, with a focus on the current opioid crisis. In FY 2024, HRSA will support the continuation of these cooperative a greements. RCORP -Technical Assistance and Evaluation provide technical assistance and evaluation support encompassing the entire RCORP initiative . HRSA will support the continuation of funding for each of the initiative -wide technical assistance and ev aluation cooperative agreements in FY 2024. Rural Behavioral Health Workforce Centers develop and implement training and mentorship programs that build the capacity of rural health care providers, paraprofessionals, non -clinical staff, and community mem bers to care for individuals with behavioral health, including SUD/OUD, needs in rural locations within the Northern Border Regional Commission. HRSA will continue funding these cooperative agreements in FY 2024. Additionally, the FY 2024 Budget request will support new grants and cooperative agreements for RCORP to strengthen the infrastructure and capacity within rural communities at high risk for SUDs, rural communities to rapidly address their immediate SUD needs (including lifesaving naloxone), addre ss health equity, and provide needed prevention, treatment, and recovery services to rural residents. The FY 2024 budget request will also support the continuation of grants awarded in FY 2023 which provide targeted support to address neonatal abstinence syndrome as well as children and adolescents living in rural communities. HRSA will continue to solicit feedback from rural stakeholders and engage and partner with other Federal agencies to promote a coordinated approach to combatting this devastating ep idemic and ensure HRSA's efforts are aligned with the HHS Overdose Prevention Strategy and other Administration priorities. 444 EQUITY Health Center Program The health center model of care uniquely positions health centers to address health disparities and advance health equity. As community -based and patient -directed organizations, health centers ensure access to affordable, quality, and cost -effective primary health care to the nation's underserved and most socially vulnerable populations. Nearly 1,40 0 HRSA -funded health centers operate nearly 15,000, providing comprehensive primary and preventive care on a sliding fee scale to over 30 million patients annually. Approximately 90% of health center patients are individuals or families living at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines and approximately 63% of health center patients are racial/ethnic minorities. Health centers also serve over 1 million agricultural workers, about 1.3 million individuals experiencing homelessness, and approximately 5.7 million individuals living in or near public housing. In addition to ensuring access to primary and preventive care, health centers' model of care includes the provision of non -clinical enabling services, including translation, transportation, outreac h and education, care coordination, and eligibility assistance, that recognize and help to address the social and environmental barriers to health and to health care experienced by their patients. National Health Service Corps SUD Workforce Loan Repayment Program The NHSC SUD LRP has worked to increase access to evidence -based SUD treatment to communities in need. Providers recognized through this program are dedicated to caring for underserved communities in urban, rural, and tribal areas. Eac h NHSC clinician serves patients in Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) - communities with limited access to health care. In addition, the NHSC SUD Workforce LRP clinicians work at NHSC -approved SUD treatment facilities that have implemented a Sliding Fee Discount Program that enables the site to offer services to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Addiction Medicine Fellowship P rogram The AMF Program aims to improve equity by improving the health of the underserved and connecting skilled professional to communities in need. Awardees are to collaborate and establish relationships with underserved, community -based settings. Within these settings, the addiction medicine/addiction psychiatry fellows are to practice knowledge and skills acquired in the treatment of the populations served by the facility during a clinical rotation. They may also complete a clinical rotation at a commu nity-based setting that specializes in the treatment of infants, children, adolescents, or pregnant or postpartum women where they are also practicing the knowledge and skills acquired. Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Loan Repayment Progra m The STAR LRP aims to improve equity by reducing the barriers to access to SUD, including opioid treatment and recovery services. The workforce supported through this program work in both mental Health Professional Shortage Areas and areas where the dru g overdose mortality 445 rates are above the national average. The STAR LRP also recognizes SUD support services provided by behavioral health paraprofessionals as an eligible provider types and new community -based settings (e.g. faith -based settings, crisis m anagement centers, etc.) as eligible access points for treatment or recovery services. Rural Communities Opioid Response Program RCORP addresses the disproportionate challenges rural communities face in accessing behavioral health care services, which i nclude limited workforce, transportation barriers, and stigma, through community -based grants and technical assistance. RCORP funding also targets behavioral health care disparities within rural communities. For example, applicants to RCORP programs are encouraged to include populations that have historically suffered from poorer health outcomes, health disparities, and other inequities as compared to the rest of the population. Examples of these populations include, but are not limited to: racial and eth nic minorities, people who are pregnant, adolescents and youth, LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, etc. Since FY 2021, RCORP recipients have been required to produce a Disp arities Impact Statement during the course of their grant to enable them to monitor and assess the impact their programs have on vulnerable populations within their service areas. In accordance with Executive Order 13985, RCORP programs will continue to e mphasize consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment. 446 Significant Items TAB 447 SIGNIFICANT ITEMS FOR INCLUSION IN L -HHS APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE FY 2024 CONGRESSIONAL JUSTIFICATION HOUSE REPORT 117 -403 (June 5, 2022) 1) Health Center Controlled Networks (HCCNs). \u2014These networks are the foundation of health information technology (HIT) services for the nation's community health centers. Health centers function as the largest primary care network in the country, caring for 30 million patients. HCCNs are voluntary ass ociations of community health centers that band together to invest in HIT tools, optimize the use of these technologies, digitally connect to health care and community partners, and more. The HIT infrastructure requires robust Federal investment to support the demand caused by the COVID -19 pandemic's resulting shift in how health care is provided. The Committee encourages HRSA to provide robust support for these networks and requests as part of the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification an upda te on the status of the network HIT infrastructure. (Page 44) Action to be Taken HRSA will continue to support HCCNs in FY 2023. Below is the requested update. Health IT has become essential in supporting the delivery of high -quality, culturally competent, equitable, and comprehensive primary health care, which has increased the need for health centers to expand their use of digital health tools. Health Center Controlled Networks (HCCNs) are groups of health centers that are funded by H RSA to support health IT adoption and implementation for BPHC's Health Center Program (HCP). The HCP functions as one of the largest primary care networks in the country, with approximately 1,400 health centers and over 14,000 service delivery sites that p rovide care for 30 million patients annually. HCCNs have provided health IT and data integration support to health centers for more than 20 years, with approximately 90 percent of current health centers formally partnering with an HCCN. HCCNs support heal th centers with health IT and data needs with a specific focus on improvements in clinical quality, patient -centered care, and provider and staff well -being. HCCNs support health centers that participate in their networks individually and collectively to address clinical and operational needs that include strengthening care coordination, reducing administrative burden through improved patient workflows, utilizing digital health tools, and facilitating data exchange with local, state/territory, and national public health bodies. HCCNs provide specialized training and technical assistance to leverage economies of scale, such as group purchasing power, shared resources and training, and data analytics to support quality measurement and improvement. In addition , health IT and data systems support health centers in addressing health disparities by enabling providers to develop data -informed and coordinated interventions. Annual HCP 448 funding allows HCCNs to build upon the demonstrated success of previous HCCN award s. Health centers will continue to benefit from their participation in the networks, working together to strengthen and leverage health IT to improve health centers' operational and clinical practices that result in better health outcomes for the communiti es the health centers serve. 2) Sickle Cell Anemia Demonstration Program. \u2014The Committee includes $8,205,000 for this program, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee recognizes the importance of the program in supporting the comprehensive sickle cell disease (SCD) centers in the provision of coordinated comprehensive, culturally competent, and family -centered care to people with SCD. The Committee affirms the goals of the program to improve care delivery and access to high quality care for people with SCD, with a focus on increasing access to SCD specialists; increase the number of providers with SCD expertise and knowledge of SCD treatment methods; and enable access to the latest treatment options following evidence -based guidelines. With the start of new five -year grant awards in fiscal year 2022, the Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on how the program is supporting the growth of co mprehensive sickle cell disease centers that provide the latest treatment options following evidence -based guidelines and have mechanisms to identify and serve patients with SCD who are not currently being cared for by SCD specialists. (Page 58) Actions t o be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA initiated a 5 -year award cycle to fund five regional treatment demonstration programs (TDPs), through the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration Program. The TDPs improve outcomes of individuals with sickle cell disease (SC D) and their families by supporting and strengthening a regional SCD infrastructure that extends access to comprehensive services to individuals with SCD and their families throughout the region. While the TDP does not directly support one comprehensive SC D Center within each region, the TDPs partner with clinics or practices in at least seven states within each region to: Develop and support comprehensive SCD care teams; Implement telehealth technologies for health care delivery, education, and health information services; Increase access to evidence -based care and the latest treatment options; and Collaborate and support care coordination within each region. TDPs work with local community -based organizations (CBOs), including 25 CBOs funded starting in FY 2021 through the Sickle Cell Disease Newborn Screening Follow -up Program, and two community health centers funded through the Hemoglobinopathies National Coordinating Center. Together, these partnerships facilitate adoption and implementation of the la test evidence -based treatments, increase the number of patients with SCD receiving care by SCD specialists, and strengthen the network of services and supports. In FY 2021, 449 the program's network providers served over 30,000 patients with SCD and 38% of individuals with SCD received disease modifying therapies within an TDP. 3) Healthy Start. \u2014The Committee recommends $145,000,000 for the Healthy Start program, $13,160,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The prog ram provides grants to communities with high rates of infant mortality to support primary and preventive health care services for mothers and their infants. The primary purpose of Healthy Start is to reduce maternal and infant mortality and to generally im prove maternal and infant health. Grants are awarded to nonprofits, State and local health departments and community health centers in eligible communities with high rates of infant mortality and other adverse birth outcomes, to develop a package of innova tive health and social services for pregnant women and infants, and evaluate those services. Funding is provided to both increase funding to existing grantees so they can increase the number of individuals served and to support new, additional awards to co mmunity -based organizations for targeted initiatives to reduce disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on existing evaluations of Healthy Start's effectiveness . (Page 59) Actions to be Taken Healthy Start is committed to data -driven and evidence -based decision -making. In FY 2021, HRSA invested in a four -year contract to conduct a national evaluation of the Healthy Start program to determine the effectiveness of the program. Using a mixed methods approach, the evaluation will assess program implementation, service utilization, health outcomes, and transformational changes in Healthy Start communities. The evaluation concludes in FY 2025, and resul ts will be used to inform decision -making and develop recommendations to improve implementation of the Healthy Start program. These efforts continue to build from evaluation work that began in 2017 when Healthy Start initiated a national evaluation that showed positive outcomes related to program goals.223 These include earlier and more frequent prenatal care visits, greater engagement in infant safe sleep practices, and lower rates of low -birth -weight deliveries. Healthy Start participants also met or exce eded targets with respect to usual source of care and depression screening. 4) HRSA Chief Dental Officer. \u2014The Committee is disturbed to learn that despite its directive to have HRSA ensure that the Chief Dental Officer (CDO) is functioning at an executive level with resources and staff to lead oral health programs and initiatives across HRSA, no such authority has been delegated. The Committee urges HRSA to hire a CDO and restore the position with executive level authority and resources to oversee and lead den tal programs and initiatives across the agency. The CDO is also expected to serve as the agency representative on oral health issues to international, national, State, and/or local government agencies, universities, and oral health stakeholder organization s. The Committee requests an 223 Abt Associates (2020). Evaluation of the Implementation and Outcomes of the Maternal & Child Health Bureau's Federal Healthy Start Program. 450 update as part of the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on how the CDO is serving as the agency representative with executive level authority on oral health issues to international, national, State and/or local gover nment agencies, universities, and oral health stakeholder organizations. (Page 67) Actions to be Taken In an August 2021 reorganization, HRSA moved the CDO position into a new office under the Office of the Administrator, the Office of Special Health Init iatives (OSHI). OSHI provides a crosscutting focal point for HRSA to deliver on population health and Secretarial priorities, especially those that may be more clinical in nature. In May of 2022, OSHI successfully recruited and onboarded a new CDO. As part of the new office formed by HRSA, the CDO position at HRSA is responsible for leading the following executive functions: coordinating oral health activities across HRSA programs and leading HRSA on oral health priorities throughout the various programs in the agency. OSHI reports directly to the Immediate Office of the Administrator, which provides the CDO regular opportunities to engage with the Administrator and as directed, lea d initiatives and efforts for all of HRSA. In addition to the resources and staff support that OSHI now brings to the CDO position, the CDO also has access to resources and staff across the agency due to the agency wide leadership and role the CDO plays. Since joining HRSA, he has been integrated into the process to review and advise on proposed oral health -related investments across the agency; represented the agency at stakeholder engagements and meetings; provided presentations on the agency's oral hea lth portfolio and key topics of interest and led efforts on the Oral Health Literacy, Awareness and Education Campaign (OHLAE). The Chief Dental Officer has played a critical role in leading the design, planning and development, monitoring and oversight o f an oral health awareness and education campaign for health center patients, people with HIV/AIDS, parents and caregivers of young children, and rural populations. The campaign incorporates messaging around early detection, disease prevention, and oral he alth promotion and HRSA is expecting to launch it in Spring 2023. Amplification efforts on campaign messaging are in development to ensure maximum reach to underserved areas, including a key role for the Chief Dental Officer in meeting with stakeholders a nd HRSA's grantees. Under the leadership of the Chief Dental Officer, the campaign also provides a foundation for HRSA to begin development of an agency -wide oral health strategy and broaden content focuses for underserved populations. Areas such as the oral-systemic connection, impact of prevention services, oral health during pregnancy, and innovative care delivery models such as teledentistry, medical dental integration, mobile dental services, and community -based programs will be targeted in order to increase access to care. HRSA intends for this campaign to be a valuable piece of a larger vision for oral health efforts for the agency. 451 Legislative Proposals TAB 452 Legislative Proposals 1. Modify the National Organ Transplant Act to Improve HHS Oversight of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network HRSA is seeking to modernize the statutory tools governing the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) to improve oversight and accountability and be tter allow the network to evolve as medical science, information technology, and patient needs change. HRSA proposes changes aimed at increasing competition for OPTN contracts and updating OPTN's data collection requirements to improve transparency about a nd monitoring of equity, access, and long -term outcomes. Specifically, HRSA is seeking a statutory change to strengthen OPTN functions and improve outcomes for patients and families by enhancing oversight and transparency, increasing competition around OPT N procurements, and improving efficiency in the organ transplantation system. 2. 340B Drug Pricing Program Integrity: Establishment of Reporting Requirements and Definitions for the Use of Savings and Contract Pharmacy Utilization The FY 2024 Budget Reques t proposes to enhance 340B Program integrity by requiring covered entities to annually report to HRSA how the savings achieved through the Program benefits the communities they serve and provide HRSA regulatory authority to implement this requirement. HRS A also proposes explicit regulatory authority to define necessary terms. HRSA is also proposing to strengthen compliance and transparency related to the utilization of contract pharmacies. 3. Extending Tax -Exempt Status to Specific Scholarship and Loan Rep ayment Programs HRSA proposes extending the tax -exempt status that is provided to the National Health Service Corps Program recipients to HRSA's similar health care workforce programs, including the Nurse Corps Scholarship and Loan Repayment Programs, Native Hawaiian Health Scholarship Program, the Faculty Loan Repayment Program, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Pediatric Subspecial ty Loan Repayment Program, and the Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Loan Repayment Program. The savings would allow HRSA to make additional awards through these programs to grow and expand the health workforce, including behavioral health pro viders. 453 4. Requiring Health Centers to Provide Behavioral Health Services HRSA is seeking to add behavioral health services to the statutory list of required primary health services that health centers must provide. Requiring health centers to provide the se services will improve access to behavioral health services in the nation's most medically underserved communities, reducing disparities and improving health outcomes. With approximately 40 percent of health centers located in rural areas, this proposal will have a meaningful impact in rural communities . 5. Reauthorization of Mandatory Appropriations for the Community Health Center Fund HRSA is seeking a 3-year extension of mandatory funding for the Health Center Program, which will currently expire at the end of FY 2023. The Health Center Program provides equitable access to health care services for millions of medically underserved individuals across the country. With continued and increased funding of the Community Health Center Fund, the Health Center Program will further strengthen and expand this vital source of primary care for millions of patients seeking a quality source of care. 6. Reauthorization of Mandat ory Appropriations for the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Fund HRSA is requesting a 3 -year extension of mandatory funding for the NHSC, which currently expires at the end of FY 2023. Since its inception in 1972, the NHSC has worked to support qualif ied health care providers dedicated to working in underserved communities. NHSC clinicians serve patients in Health Professional Shortage Areas (communities with limited access to health care) in return for scholarships and loan repayment. The proposed fun ding levels will maintain current investments and ensure that the NHSC recruitment and retention programs continue to be a significant source of highly qualified clinicians working in areas of greatest need across the country. 7. Reauthorization of Mandator y Appropriations for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) Program HRSA is requesting a 3 -year extension of mandatory funding for the THCGME Program, which currently expires at the end of FY 2023. The program focuses on supportin g residents in primary care , including o bstetrics and gynecology and p sychiatry , and dental residency training programs to meet the medical and mental health care needs of rural and underserved communities . Increased funding for the THCGME Program will mai ntain current residents' investments and allow them to complete residency training and graduate from their respective programs. In addition, HRSA is proposing removal of the statutory annual cap on payments made through the THCGME program . Remov ing this li mitation would enable HRSA to utilize all funds appropriated for the THCGME program (including those recouped after reconciliation). 454 Vaccine Injury Compensation Program TAB 455 VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM Table of Contents FY 2024 Budget Appropriation Language ................................ for Authority by Activity ................................

FY 2024 Authorization...............................................................................Indefinite Allocation Method...................................................................................Other Program Description Serving as an alternative to the traditional tort system, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) compensates individuals or families of individuals who have been injured by vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion (CDC) for routine administration to children or pregnant women. HRSA administers the VICP, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) represents HHS in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Court), which ultimately decides to provide compensation or dismiss cla ims. HRSA receives claims requesting compensation for vaccine injuries or deaths, which the petitioner has served against the HHS Secretary and filed with the Court. HRSA medical officers with special expertise in pediatric and adult medicine review the se claims, including supporting documentation. HRSA also contracts with health care professionals for claim reviews and other medical specialists to provide independent claim reviews and testify in Court. HRSA medical officers develop preliminary recomme ndations regarding petitioner eligibility for compensation, and DOJ incorporates these recommendations in Rule 4(b) reports submitted to the Court. Lastly, HRSA processes payments to petitioners and their attorneys based on judgments entered by the Court. HRSA also publishes notices in the Federal Register listing each claim received and promulgates regulations to modify the Vaccine Injury Table that lists injuries and/or conditions associated with covered vaccines. HRSA provides administrative support t o the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV), which is responsible for advising the HHS Secretary on issues related to VICP operations. The ACCV has nine voting members, including health care professionals, attorneys, parents or legal representa tives of children who have suffered vaccine - related injuries or death, and non -voting HHS officials. 462 Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund Congress annually appropriates funding from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund (Trust Fund) for VICP ad ministration and compensation for vaccine -related injury or death claims for covered vaccines administered on or after October 1, 1988. The Trust Fund has a current balance of over $4 billion. The Department of Treasury maintains the Trust Fund through a $0.75 excise tax on vaccines recommended by the CDC for routine administration to children or pregnant women. The excise tax applies to each disease prevented per vaccine dose. For example, the influenza vaccine is taxed $0.75 because it prevents one di sease, while the measles -mumps -rubella vaccine, which prevents three diseases, is taxed $2.25. The Department of Treasury collects the excise taxes and manages Trust Fund investments. Petitioners include individuals, parents, or legal representatives/es tates applying on behalf of others. VICP Administration VICP claims have increased more than fivefold from 402 claims filed in FY 2012 to 2,057 claims filed in FY 2021, while the administrative funding has barely doubled from $6.5 million to $11.2 mill ion during the same period, as shown in Table 1. In FY 2022, petitioners filed 1,029 claims and $13.2M was appropriated for administrative funding. In FY 2017, HRSA began experiencing a backlog of vaccine injury claims awaiting medical review since th e volume of claims exceeded the resources available to conduct medical reviews. The cumulative claims backlog was 966 claims at the end of FY 2020. Even though the number of claims filed decreased in FY 2022 to 1,029 and the funding to administer the VIC P increased by $2 million from $11.2 million in FY 2021 to $13.2 million in FY 2022, the backlog was 1,580 by the end of FY 2022, which is slightly higher than the1,568 backlog at the end of FY 2021. The backlog results in compensation delays since claims are on the waiting list for about 12 months pending review. Table 1. 10 -Year Trend in Number of Claims Filed and Administrative Costs (dollars in millions) Fiscal Year Number of Claims Filed Administrative Funding 2013 504 $6.50 2014 claims in January 2021 due to the expected implementation of the final rule proposed to remove Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA) from the Vaccine Injury Table. 463 Budget Request VICP Claims Compensation The FY 2024 Budget Request for the VICP Claims Compensation Program of $261.5 million is $5.1 million more than the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will help provide funds to compensate petitioners and pay their attorneys' fees and costs. VICP Administration The FY 2024 Budget Request for the VICP Administration Pro gram of $26.2 million is $11 million more than the FY 2023 Enacted level. This request will support administrative expenses to process approximately 2,310 claims. This request will also support administrative expenses for medical review staff, contractor s to conduct medical reviews to reduce the backlog of claims, and medical experts for reviews and expert testimony to the Court. The funding request also covers costs associated with the claims award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

Other Program Description : The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) provides benefits to individuals seriously injured as a result of the administration or use of covered countermeasures. A countermeasure is a vaccinatio n, medication, device, or other item recommended to diagnose, prevent or treat a declared pandemic, epidemic, or security threat. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) authorizes the CICP to provide medical and lost employment in come benefits to certain individuals or estates of individuals who sustain covered serious physical injuries as the direct result of the administration or use of covered countermeasures. The CICP also provides death benefits to certain survivors of eligib le deceased injured countermeasure recipients. The PREP Act declarations identify the countermeasures covered by CICP. Budget Request The FY 2024 Budget Request for the CICP of $15 million is $8 million more than the FY 2023 Enacted level. This FY 202 4 funding will be used to improve the CICP information technology (IT) infrastructure, increase process efficiencies, enhance communication with requesters and substantially increase the CICP's capacity to review and complete at least 2,000 claims reviews, and provide compensation to eligible individuals for injuries and deaths directly resulting from the use of covered countermeasures, including COVID -19 countermeasures. In FY 2022, the $5 million appropriation allowed the CICP to increase staffing and in itiate review of over 600 claims compared to 30 claim reviews initiated in FY 2021, and awarded a contract that provided system enhancements, data aggregation, and business process improvements. 472 Funding History Fiscal Year Amount Supplemental Funding FY 2020 Program Accomplishments As of January 1, 2023, nearly 11,100 claims alleging injuries/deaths from COVID -19 countermeasures have been filed with the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, including 7,780 claims alleging injuries from COVID -19 vaccines.
