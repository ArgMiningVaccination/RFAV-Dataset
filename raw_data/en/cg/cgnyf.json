Objective: To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of NHS-relevant pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to manage sleep disturbance in children and young people with NDs, who have non-respiratory sleep disturbance. Data sources: Sixteen databases, including The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and MEDLINE, were searched up to February 2017, and grey literature searches and hand-searches were conducted. Review methods: For pharmacological interventions, only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. For non-pharmacological interventions, RCTs, non-randomised controlled studies and before-and - after studies were included. Data were extracted and quality assessed by two researchers. Meta-analysis and narrative synthesis were undertaken. Data on parents 'and children 's experiences of receiving a sleep disturbance intervention were collated into themes and reported narratively. Results: Thirty-nine studies were included. Sample sizes ranged from 5 to 244 participants. Thirteen RCTs evaluated oral melatonin. Twenty-six studies (12 RCTs and 14 before-and-after studies) evaluated interventions ( n=7). All but one study were reported as having a high or unclear risk of bias, and studies were generally poorly reported. There was a statistically significant increase in diary-reported total sleep time (TST), which was the most commonly reported outcome for melatonin compared with placebo [pooled mean difference 29.6 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.9 toDOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

For the single melatonin study that was rated as having a low risk of bias, the mean increase in TST was 13.2 minutes and the lower CI included the possibility of reduced sleep time (95% CI -13.3 to 39.7 minutes). There was mixed evidence about the clinical effectiveness of the non-pharmacological interventions. Sixteen studies included interventions that investigated the feasibility, acceptability and/or parent or clinician views of sleep disturbance interventi ons. The majority of these studies reported the 'family experience 'of non-pharmacological interventions. Limitations: Planned subgroup analysis was possible in only a small number of melatonin trials. Conclusions: There is some evidence of benefit for melatonin compared with placebo, but the degree of benefit is uncertain. There are various types of non-pharmacological interventions for managing sleep disturbance; however, clinical and methodological heterogeneity, few RCTs, a lack of standardised outcome measures and risk of bias means that it is not possible to draw conclusions with regard to their effectiveness. Future work should include the development of a core outcome, further evaluation of the clinical effec tiveness and cost-effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions and research exploring the prevention of, and methods for identifying, sleep disturbance. Research mapping current practices and exploring families 'understanding of sleep disturbance and their experiences of obtaining help may facilitate service provision development.

Sleep problems can affect children 's and parents 'mental, physical and emotional well-being, and, so, help with children 's sleep is a main concern for parents. There is a wide range of drug and non-drug treatments available to manage sleep disturbance. However, very little is known about whether or not these treatments make a difference; in other words, are these treatments effective? This study aimed to investigate this gap in knowledge. We reviewed previous research to find out what is already known about the effectiveness of drug and non-drug treatments. Study results suggest that one drug (melatonin) may be helpful for managing children 's sleep. However, we cannot tell how beneficial it is. There are also many non-drug treatments (e.g. information leaflets, parent training groups, one-to-one work between a parent and a professional). However, the studies evaluating these sorts of help tested different treatments in different ways. This means that we cannot tell how beneficial each treatment is. A limited number of studies also looked at families 'or professionals 'views and experiences of these treatments. Overall, research on treatments of sleep disturbance in children is limited, with only one drug (melatonin) showing signs of benefit. Owing to the limited number of studies available and the largely poor quality of this research, it is not possible to make any suggestions for clinical practice. More research is needed to identify the best treatments for sleep problems among children with neurodisabilities.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

Difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance and sleep scheduling result in disturbed sleep not only for the individual, but often for other family members as well. Non-respiratory sleep disturbances in children with neurodisabilities (NDs) are more common and more severe than in children with typical development. However, sleep disturbance is rarely a diagnostic criterion; rather, it co-occurs with a diagnosis of a ND. Non-respiratory causes of sleep disturbance among children with NDs include behavioural factors (e.g. parenting), damage or disorders affecting circadian rhythms, hyperarousal, pain, seizures, anxiety and the presence of medical technologies. Many children have more than one sleep difficulty and the aetiology of sl eep disturbance is often multifactorial. Sleep disturbances are associated with poor cognitive, physical and/or emotional outcomes for children and parents and result in increased demands on services. Help with sleep is a high priority for parents, practitioners and other stakeholders. However, support is patchy and approaches to managing sleep disturbance are variable and inconsistent. Interventions include pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Pharmacological interventions act on the physiological processes of sleep and/or the timing of the sleep -wake cycle. All are prescribed 'off-label '. psychoeducational i nterventions, chronotherapy, erapy, dietary changes and sensory interventions. Evidence on intervent ion effectiveness is particularly limited for some of these approaches. Importantly, the evidence on pharmacological and non-ph armacological interventions, and across all types of NDs, has never been subject to a single review. Objectives lAssess the clinical effectiveness and safety of different intervention approaches to sleep disturbances for children with NDs and, when possible, to: \u00a2Examine whether or not the clinical effectiveness of an intervention differs for different types of ND, different causes of sleep disturbance and different types of sleep disturbance. \u00a2Review and evaluate evidence regarding the use of more than one intervention approach, sequentially or in combination, to manage a specific cause of sleep disturbance. \u00a2Review and evaluate evidence regarding the impact of the setting and/or skills/qualifications of practitioners on intervention effectiveness. lAssess evidence regarding the acceptability and feasibility of sleep disturbance interventions. lDescribe the settings in which sleep disturbance interventions are being delivered, and by whom. lMake recommendations, when appropriate, with respect to the management of sleep disturbance among children with NDs generally and/or with respect to particular NDs. lIdentify and describe interventions that look promising and are of relevance and/or feasible to the NHS but that have not been robustly evaluated. lMake recommendations regarding priorities for future primary research on this topic.

The reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and included studies were also scanned. There were no limits on date, language or study designs. Studies of children and young people with NDs experiencing non-re spiratory sleep disturbances were included. Studies of NHS-relevant pharmacological and non-phar macological interventions targeted at improving sleep in any setting with and without a comparator were eligi ble. For pharmacological interventions, only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. For non-pha rmacological interventions, RCTs and other study designs, with and without a comparator, were eligible. Qualitativ e and quantitative studies of parents 'or children 's experiences of receiving a sleep disturbance intervention were included. Key study characteristics and results were extracted and quality assessed independe ntly by two researchers. When possible, a meta-analysis was undertaken and, when feasible, subgroup an alyses considering previous interventions and NDs were undertaken. When meta-analysis was not possible, a narr ative synthesis approach was adopted. Qualitative and quantitative data on parents 'or children 's experiences of receiving a sleep disturbance intervention were collated into themes or topic areas. A descriptive narr ative of these findings was produced. Results A total of 39 studies were identified: 25 RCTs and 14 before-and-after studies (one with a control group). Sample sizes varied (range 5 -244 participants). Thirteen RCTs investigated a pharmacological intervention, namely the use of oral melatonin. Twenty-six studies investigated non-pharmacological interventions. Nine of these evaluated parent-directed tailored interventions, eight evaluated parent-directed non-tailored interventions and two evaluated non-comprehensive parent-directed interventions. A further seven studies evaluated other non-pharmacological dietary interventions, n=2; alternative blankets, n=1; faded bedtime with response costs, n=1; and light therapy with a daytime activities programme, n=1. With the exception of one study, all studies were rated as having a risk of bias. Findings from the pharmacological interventions suggest that there was evidence of benefit with melatonin compared with placebo. There was a statistically significant increase in diary-reported total sleep time (TST), which was the most commonly reported outcome, with melatonin compared with placebo [pooled mean difference 29.6 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.9 to 52.4 minutes; p=0.01]; however, the statistical heterogeneity was extremely high (97%). For the single melatonin study that was rated as having a low risk of bias, the mean increase in TST was 13.2 minutes and the lower CI included the possibility of reduced sleep time (95% CI -13.3 to 39.7 minutes). It is difficult to draw conclusions as regards the clinical effectiveness of the non-pharmacological interventions, owing to the limited number of RCTs, the variation and range of outcome measures and the risk of studies being underpowered to detect an effect. Sixteen of the interventions included in the clinical effectiveness review were also investigated in terms of their feasibility and/or acceptability and/or the parent/clinician views of the intervention. These outcomes are referred to as 'family experience 'data; however, such data were limited. The majority of studies used quantitative methods to investigate family experiences of non-pharmacological interventions with the exception of one study, which reported on difficulties with administering medication.SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukxxivConclusions The evidence on the management of sleep disturbances in children with NDs is limited and largely of poor quality. There is some evidence of benefit for melatonin compared with placebo. The extent of this benefit is uncertain and so it is not possible to make recommendations for practice. There is a range of non-pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbance. The clinical effectiveness of these interventions is unclear, owing to the limited number of RCTs, the heterogeneous nature of the interventions and outcomes used and the insufficient power in studies to detect any effect. Implications for health care It has not been possible to draw conclusions about the clinical effectiveness of pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions owing to the quality of research and the lack of available evidence. Recommendations for research lThe development of a core set of outcome measures would facilitate the evaluation of future assessments of the impact of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbance. lFurther exploration of existing tools, practices and strategies to identify sleep problems in children with ND disorders in routine practice would be beneficial. lTrials comparing slow-release and fast-release melatonin may be useful. lFurther investigation of combined or sequential use of melatonin (or other pharmacological interventions) and parent-directed interventions is suggested. lTrials evaluating parent-directed interventions are needed. They should include an exploration of intervention feasibility and acceptability. Interventions addressing sleep initiation should be prioritised. lEvaluations of low-intensity parent-directed interventions -evaluated to date in children with recognised sleep disturbance -as preventative interventions are recommended. lResearch that maps current practices and explores families 'understanding of sleep disturbance, and their experiences of obtaining help, is suggested in order to inform developments in service provision. lAll studies should seek to include a health economics evaluation.

The call was for a systematic review to address the question of which interventions -pharmacological and non-pharmacological -are clinically effective for non-respiratory sleep disturbances in children with neurodisabilities (NDs) and which have generalisable, as opposed to disorder-specific, effects. The brief requested a broad systematic review to'take stock 'of the current evidence that is available on what works and for whom and to identify promising interventions for future primary research. The following two sections describe the definitions used to identify the scope of the review; we then move on to discuss, specifically, the issue of sleep disturbance in children with NDs. Sleep disturbance Sleep has been described as an active 'restorative process '1and is essential for optimal physical and mental functioning and well-being. It is a complex process: the timing, duration and quality of sleep is the outcome of the interplay of biological processes, socioenvironmental influences and behaviours. As a result, there is a wide range of reasons why an individual 's sleep may be affected in some way and, for children with NDs, the cause may be multifactorial.2-9 TheInternational Classification of Sleep Disorders -Third Edition (ICSD-3)10lists the current diagnostic categorisation of sleep disorders as follows: insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence (e.g. narcolepsy), circadian rhythm sleep -wake disorders, parasomnias, sleep-related movement disorders and 'other sleep disorders '. The extent to which sleep is disturbed, or interrupted, is a diagnostic criterion for insomnias and circadian rhythm sleep -wake disorders. That said, it is accepted that there needs to be room for clinical judgement regarding the clinical significance of the extent of sleep disturbance.11 However, although the ICSD-3 provides a classification and diagnostic framework, it is important to note that, in paediatric research at least, very few studies actually use the ICSD-3 criteria to define or screen research participants.12,13Instead, in both the clinical and research literature, a number of different phrases are used to describe the manifestations of a sleep disorder in terms of the impact that it has on an individual 's sleep: sleep disturbance, sleep problems and sleep difficulties.2Such terms have all been used for issues related to falling asleep (i.e. sleep initiation) and staying asleep, as opposed to night wakings or very early waking (i.e. sleep maintenance). The scope of this review was guided by the commissioning brief, which made two clear specifications: it should be concerned with 'non-respiratory sleep disturbance ' and sleep disturbance (experienced by the child and/or parent) should be a feature of the presenting problem. The ICSD-3 classification was use to specify sleep disorders that were relevant, or not, to the review. Three types of sleep disorder were not relevant because disturbed sleep is not a diagnostic feature, namely sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence (e.g. narcolepsy) and sleep-related movement disorders. Interventions that addressed sleep disturbances that aligned with the diagnostic features of insomnias or circadian sleep -wake cycle disorders were included. In addition, we included parasomnias because of the potential impact that they could have on parental sleep. However, for reasons noted above, we did not require studies to use the ICSD-3 to define or screen participants. We briefly set out the ICSD-3 definitions of these disorders in the following sections.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

It comprises three subcategories: (1) chronic insomnia disorder, (2) short-term insomnia disorder and (3) other insomnia disorders. In children, chronic insomnia also includes behavioural insomnia disorders, the aetiology of which is located in the practices of parents around bedtime/settling and responding to night/early-morning wakings.12Behavioural insomnias are common in childhood, with an even higher prevalence among children with NDs.14 Circadian rhythm sleep -wake disorders Circadian rhythm sleep -wake disorders are characterised by abnormalities in the length, timing and/or regularity of the sleep -wake cycle relative to the day -night cycle. It is caused by genetic, neurological or visual pathway damage/disorders affecting circadian rhythms, including melatonin release.14,15 Parasomnias Parasomnias were included in the review because of the impact that they have on parents 'sleep. The ICSD-3 defines parasomnias as sleep-related occurrences that represent undesirable physical or cognitive experiences (e.g. sleep terrors, sleep walking) occurring out of sleep, during the transition from sleep to the awake state or from the awake state to sleep. They are more common in children than in adults.16 Childhood neurodisability A consensus definition offered by Morris et al.17defines NDs as: . . . congenital or acquired long-term conditions that are attributed to impairment of the brain and/or neuromuscular system and create functional limitations. A wide range of conditions fall under this definition, including cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Down syndrome and other chromosome disorders, epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), neurometabolic degenerative conditions (e.g. Batten disease), genetic disorders (e.g. Rett syndrome), as well as non-specific diagnoses such as 'learning/intellectual disability 'and 'developmental delay '. The involvement of the brain and/or neuromuscular system means that children can experience a range of impairments (e.g. sensory, learning, physical/motor function and speech and language) and health complications or clinical needs (e.g. respiratory, orthopaedic, gastroenterological and pain management). The severity of impairment can range from mild to profound. The fact that it is not uncommon for some conditions to co-occur adds to the complexity and severity of impairment. It is not surprising, therefore, that many children with NDs are frequent users of the health service at all levels: community, primary care inpatient and outpatient settings.18 In terms of epidemiology, some NDs are quite common (e.g. autism affects 1 in 100 children, cerebral palsies affect 1 in 400 children and severe intellectual disabilities affect 3 in 1000 children). However, also within this 'cluster 'of conditions are very rare syndromes [e.g. tuberous sclerosis (incidence of <1i n 100,000) and ataxia telangiectasia (incidence of <1 in 40,000)].19Estimates of the overall prevalence of ND among the child population in England vary depending on the measure/indicator used and all are flawed in some way. However, it is generally accepted that 4 in 100 children have a ND and that children with NDs constitute the largest group of disabled children.19BACKGROUND NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk2Sleep disturbances in children with neurodisabilities Sleep disturbances in children with NDs are more common and more severe than in children with typical development.14,15However, non-respiratory sleep disturbance is very rarely a diagnostic criterion. Indeed, this is the case only with respect to four conditions: Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Smith -Magenis syndrome and Williams syndrome.20 The impacts of sleep disturbance Sleep disturbance can have an impact on all members of the family: the child and their parents and siblings. Indeed, often it is the parents 'own sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality that precipitates them to seek help with their child 's sleep.9,21Child sleep problems are associated with poor outcomes for parents, such as heightened levels of parental stress and irritability,22,23and for children, including poorer educational progress and daytime behaviour problems.24These outcomes in themselves increase demands on statutory services, as well as creating further additional support needs, such as respite care.25,26The wider association between sleep quality and economic consequences has also been described.27,28Parents consistently highlight the need for support with their child 's sleep problems,29,30although, historically, little time has been allocated to training the relevant professionals to provide this kind of support.31Parents, practitioners and other stakeholders agree that research on sleep management interventions is a priority with respect to children with NDs.32 Interventions for non-respiratory sleep disturbance Interventions to address sleep disturbance among children with NDs examine both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Pharmacological interventions act on an aspect of the physiological processes of sleep and/or the timing of the sleep -wake cycle; the most frequently used interventions are melatonin (a hormone playing a key role in the timing of the sleep -wake cycle), clonidine (which inhibits noradrenaline activity and hence has a soporific effect) and antihistamines [which inhibit neurotransmitters (histamines) that are involved in wakefulness/alertness].33-35All are prescribed 'off-label '. Other pharmacological interventions are used in relation to children 's sleep, such as medications to manage seizures and pain; however, these are outside the scope of this review because the primary purpose of the intervention is not sleep disturbance. Non-pharmacological interventions address other causes of disturbances in sleep initiation, maintenance and/or scheduling and are wide-ranging in approach. Interventions that are available within and/or outside the NHS include: lbehavioural and cognitive behavioural interventions -addressing behavioural aspects of sleep including parents 'management of sleep behaviours and routines lchronotherapy -intervening in the timing of sleep within the 24-hour cycle lphototherapy (or 'bright light therapy ')-using light exposure to effect changes in the circadian rhythm ldietary interventions -removing stimulants and restricting to lcranial osteopathy38 lchanging the bedroom environment, for example by removing any televisions or other stimulatory materials and adjusting heating and/or lighting. Current guidance on the management of sleep disturbance in children advocates that once clinical (e.g. pain or seizures) or respiratory reasons for sleep disturbance are excluded, behavioural approaches that seek to change parents 'responses to sleep-related problems should be the 'first port of call 'for any child,33,39-41 with pharmacological intervention (and to date, this is typically melatonin) suggested in cases in which such approaches prove ineffective, which should be used alongside behavioural parent-directed approaches.2,42DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018. This work was produced by Beresford et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.3The justification for this is that, in common with children with typical development, the origins of sleep difficulties for many disabled children are behavioural, located in the way in which parents address and manage their child 's sleep.4,43,44The intensity of behavioural intervention depends on the complexity of the sleep problem and/or child/family-centred factors. Sleep problems that cannot be resolved through low-intensity approaches (e.g. simple information leaflets, verbal information/guidance during a routine appointment, one-off 'sleep management workshops ') may require a more tailored and sustained approach involving a detailed assessment of the sleep problem, the creation of a bespoke sleep management strategy (based on behaviour modification principles) and time-limited (typically face-to-face) support as parents implement the strategy. In recent years, there has also been an increasing interest in using groups, as opposed to a series of one-to-one sessions, to deliver behavioural sleep support to parents.45Furthermore, online 'self-directed 'sleep management interventions for adults are now available (e.g. Sleepio.com), and the management of sleep disturbance also appears within the curricula of newly available online parenting interventions for parents of children with typical development and disabilities (e.g. Stepping Stones Triple P). Constrained resources and wider changes in the way in which health care is delivered mean that it is likely that these newer modes of delivering behavioural sleep management intervention, such as groups and self-management, will increasingly be considered and used by clinicians and parents.46It was important, therefore, that this review examined evidence of the impact that the mode of delivery has on outcomes. The availability of sleep interventions and the organisation of sleep disturbance services A number of different services deliver a sleep management intervention to children with NDs. They include community paediatric teams, general practitioners, health visitors, specialist paediatric neurology/autism/ ADHD services, child and adolescent mental health services and tertiary sleep services. Within the UK, third-sector organisations (e.g. Sleep Scotland, Scope, the Children 's Sleep Charity) are also highly active in this area. Such organisations offer education/training to parents and professionals on sleep and behavioural approaches to managing sleep difficulties, as well as sleep intervention services. Some NHS trusts are commissioning services of this kind from third-sector organisations such as these. Although there has been no systematic analysis of the way that sleep disturbance in children with NDs is managed by the NHS, a recent survey of paediatricians by the British Paediatric Respiratory Society led to the conclusion that services for sleep disorders in children were 'chaotic and unplanned . . . often unfunded and frequently perceived as inadequate for local needs '.47Current practice in prescribing medicines such as melatonin has been described as haphazard48and access to behavioural interventions as patchy.49 There are a number of reasons for this current state of affairs, including the apparent absence of education on sleep disorders and sleep management in medical school education,50a lack of recognition of the importance of assessing/checking for sleep disturbance, lack of know ledge/skills or resources to deliver non-pharmacological interventions, parental expectations regarding their child 's sleep, the complexity and range of conditions falling under the umbrella of NDs and the complexity of sleep disturbance and its potential causes. In addition, although there have been some attempts to develop sleep management pathways within paediatrics, these have been restricted to particular types of sleep disturbance and/or sleep intervention and/or diagnostic groups, for which the evidence is more plentiful and/or of higher quality.47,51,52 Informing the development of a robust evidence base A robust evidence base is clearly required to inform the development of a paediatric ND sleep management pathway for non-respiratory disturbance that integrates pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. A first step towards this, as noted in the commissioning brief, is to 'take stock 'of the existing evidence base. Our preliminary scoping found that previous systematic reviews have mainly focused on either individual NDs51,53-57and/or single interventions or pharmacological interventions only.7,53,56,57BACKGROUND NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk4Three reviews that included pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions were restricted by type of population: children with ASDs,51children aged 0 -12 years with cerebral palsy or traumatic brain injury58 and children with ADHD.54One review with a wide population of chronic health conditions in patients aged up to 19 years (including NDs) investigated non-pharmacological interventions (behavioural and non- behavioural);1another review of behavioural interventions focused on disabled children aged up to 8 years.59 The search end dates for the previous reviews we identified ranged from 2004 to 2013. None of the previous reviews addressed the research question in the commissioning brief and a new review was considered appropriate. Given the complexity of sleep disturbance in children with ND, and in contrast to previous reviews, it was essential that our review evaluated pharmacological andnon-pharmacological interventions, as much as existing evidence allows, across the range of NDs and age groups. This allows identification of evidence gaps, as well as the accumulation of knowledge on which sleep disturbance interventions work (solely or in combination with other interventions) and for whom they work within the diverse population of children with NDs. Aims and objectives There were two overarching aims of this review: (1) to identify the implications for practice for non-re spiratory sleep disturbance in children with NDs, evidence permitting, and (2) to inform the focus and priorities of a future call by NIHR for primary research in this area. Unlike previous systematic reviews, we have sought to be holistic in terms of both the population (all children with a ND) and the types of intervention (i.e. pharmacological and non-pharmacological). The objectives were to: levaluate and compare the clinical effectiveness of different intervention approaches to sleep disturbances for children with NDs and, when possible, to: \u00a2examine whether or not intervention clinical effectiveness differs for different types of ND, different causes of sleep disturbance and different types of sleep disturbance (i.e. sleep initiation, sleep maintenance and sleep scheduling) \u00a2review and evaluate evidence regarding the use of more than one intervention approach, sequentially or in combination, to manage a specific cause of sleep disturbance \u00a2review and evaluate evidence regarding the impact that the setting and/or skills/qualifications of practitioners have on intervention clinical effectiveness ldescribe and compare evidence regarding the acceptability and feasibility of sleep disturbance interventions ldescribe the settings in which sleep disturbance interventions are being delivered, and by whom lmake recommendations, when appropriate, with respect to the management of sleep disturbance among children with ND generally and/or with respect to particular NDs lidentify and describe interventions that look promising and are of relevance to and/or feasible for the NHS but that have not been robustly evaluated lmake recommendations regarding priorities for future primary research on this topic ldisseminate the findings in a timely and effective way.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria Studies were assessed for eligibility based on the criteria detailed in the following sections. Population Studies of children and young people with NDs who were experiencing non-respiratory sleep disturbances were eligible for inclusion in the review. lChildren and young people aged from 0 to 18 years were eligible. We did not expect to find many studies targeted at very young infants. Some previous reviews have used a lower age cut-off point of 3 months and others have not. Given the comprehensive nature of the review, we did not use a lower age cut-off point. ND was defined in accordance with the consensus definition developed by Morris et al. :17 . . . congenital or acquired long-term conditions that are attributed to impairment of the brain and/or neuromuscular system and create functional limitations. lNon-respiratory sleep disturbances, of any duration, related to the initiation, maintenance or scheduling of sleep, diagnosed by a health-care professional based on parental/carer or child report or sleep observation were eligible. lExcluded non-respiratory sleep disorders were central disorders of hypersomnolence (in which daytime sleepiness is not caused by nocturnal sleep disturbance or misaligned circadian rhythms) and sleep-related movement disorders. We excluded studies of respiratory-related sleep disturbances. However, NDs are complex conditions and sleep disturbances may have multifactorial causes. Therefore, we included studies in which the respiratory-related component was being controlled and the focus of the intervention was another cause of sleep disturbance. We also excluded studies in which the main focus of the intervention was not treatment of the sleep disturbance (e.g. interventions to control seizures when sleep outcomes were also reported) and studies of mixed populations of children with and without a ND, unless the results were reported separately for the two groups or the sample was predominantly ( >90%) children with a ND. Intervention NHS-relevant pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions targeted at improving sleep initiation, maintenance, scheduling or sleep quality in any setting were eligible for inclusion. For pharmacological studies, 'NHS relevant 'was defined as relating to drugs that are licensed for use for this indication in children or that are currently used for this purpose in the NHS. For non-pharmacological studies, 'NHS relevant 'was defined as those interventions meeting current practice standards; for example, behavioural interventions that used punishment were excluded. Multicomponent interventions were eligible. The NHS-relevant pharmacological interventions were melatonin, clonidine and antihistamines.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

Comparator Studies using no intervention, waiting list control, placebo or another NHS-relevant intervention were eligible for inclusion. Outcomes The following outcomes were assessed. Primary outcomes: lchild 's sleep-related outcomes -parent-/carer- and child-reported outcomes relating to the initiation, maintenance, scheduling or quality of sleep (using measures such as sleep diaries, standardised scales, e.g. the Composite Sleep Disturbance Index or Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and objective measures such as actigraphy (used to calculate outcomes such as total sleep duration, time taken to fall asleep or sleep efficiency) lparent sleep-related outcomes -quality of sleep lmeasures of perceived parenting confidence and/or efficacy and/or understanding of sleep/sleep management (which are particularly relevant for parent training/behavioural interventions that seek to change the way that parents manage sleep disturbance). Secondary outcomes: lchild-related quality of life, daytime behaviour and cognition lparent/carer quality of life and well-being, including global quality of life (e.g. Short Form questionnaire - 36 items) and more specific outcomes such as physical well-being, mental well-being, and mental health (e.g. stress, depression) lfamily functioning ladverse events, including side effects from medication. Data on uptake of the intervention, retention and intervention adherence were used as indicators of the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Quantitative or qualitative data on parents '/children 's experiences of receiving a sleep disturbance intervention included: lthe acceptability and feasibility of the intervention lother experiences of receiving the intervention lsatisfaction with intervention outcomes and 'fit'with their priorities with regard to their child 's sleep disturbances; views/perspectives on the mechanisms by which outcomes were achieved.METHODS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk8Study design Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled studies, such as controlled before-and- after studies and cohort studies with a control group, were included. Both parallel and crossover RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Concerns have been expressed by others that a crossover design may be inappropriate owing to uncertainty about the duration of the effect of interventions on sleep patterns and circadian rhythm and, therefore, on the most appropriate duration for the washout period.48We agree with these concerns. However, given that the aim was to undertake a broad review and, as there were few RCTs likely to be available, we included crossover studies. In order to achieve the second objective of the review, studies without a control group were included in the absence of controlled studies, that is, cohort studies and before-and-after studies. This was because they could include potentially promising interventions that were at an early stage of evaluation. Case studies were not eligible for inclusion. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included if they reported data on parents 'or children 's experiences of receiving a sleep disturbance intervention (including intervention acceptability), such as the process of receiving the sleep intervention, satisfaction with intervention outcomes and 'fit'with their priorities with regard to their child 's sleep disturbances, and views/perspectives on the mechanisms by which outcomes were achieved. Data could be collected as part of studies of clinical effectiveness or studies that only sought to examine research questions on experiences and satisfaction. Literature searches The available evidence was identified by carrying out systematic searches of electronic databases, and reference checking of relevant reviews and included studies. The list of included studies identified from the electronic searches was shared with clinicians in the team to establish if there were any relevant studies that were missing. The searches were undertaken by an experienced information specialist and the search strategy was peer reviewed by a second information specialist. Information sources A range of databases were searched in February and March 2016 and updated in February 2017 to ensure coverage from the fields of health, nursing and allied health, and social care. We searched Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, EMBASE, Health Management Information Consortium, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-indexed Citations, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index, Social Care Online and Social Policy & Practice. The Social Care Online, Social Policy & Practice, Health Management Information Consortium, Conference Proceedings Citation Index and PsycINFO all provide some coverage of reports and other unpublished documents; therefore, the available grey literature are represented in the search results. In addition, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the UK Clinical Trials Gateway were searched for trials, both ongoing and completed. No limits on date, language or study design were applied in the searches. Full details of search strategies used and numbers of records retrieved are given for each database in Appendix 1 .DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

Consequently, we carried out some further searches of each of the databases that incorporated these new terms alongside the original search strategy. Details of these additional search strategies can be found in Appendix 2 . The reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and included studies were also scanned. Screening and study selection The database search results were all loaded into EndNote bibliographic software [version 17.0.2.7390, Clarivate Analytics (formerly Thomson Reuters), Philadelphia, PA, USA] and deduplicated. There was a three-stage screening process to manage the large number of records. First, the titles of the records were screened for relevance. Two researchers did this jointly for 10% of the titles, and the remainder were screened independently by a single researcher. Records that were identified as potentially relevant based on their title were screened independently by two researchers. When there was no consensus, a third member of the team was consulted. The full texts of potentially relevant papers were ordered. Finally, full papers were independently screened against the eligibility criteria by two researchers. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by consultation with a third team member if necessary. Data extraction A data extraction form for study details was developed and piloted. A Microsoft Excel 2010\u00aespreadsheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) was used to extract the outcome data. Owing to the various ways in which adverse events were described in papers, data for this outcome were extracted separately into a table using Microsoft Word 2010\u00ae(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). All data were extracted by one researcher and checked by a second. Details of the data items extracted are available in Appendix 3 . For the purposes of this review, we extracted follow-up data relating to the assessment time point closest to the end of the intervention. Assessment of risk of bias The Cochrane risk of bias tool62was used to assess the quality of RCTs and the newly developed tool, A Cochrane Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool: for Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ACROBAT-NRSI), was used to assess the non-randomised controlled before-and-after studies.63Uncontrolled before-and- after studies were assessed using questions adapted from ACROBAT-NRSI, as used in another HTA review.64Risk of bias was independently assessed by two researchers. Disagreements were resolved through consensus and through discussion with a third researcher if necessary. In addition, for crossover trials, we assessed whether or not an appropriate analysis using paired data was conducted and whether or not there was a treatment by period interaction, as undertaken in a previous systematic review including crossover studies.65 A summary risk-of-bias score was calculated following guidance.62This score was calculated as follows: any study that had one or more of the domains on the risk-of-bias tool classified as 'no'was considered to be rated as having a high risk of bias. Any study that had one or more domains classified as 'unclear 'on the risk-of-bias tool was considered to be rated as having an unclear risk of bias. To be considered to have a rating of a low risk of bias, a study needed to meet the criteria on all domains on the risk-of-bias tool and classify them as 'yes'.METHODS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk10For studies containing qualitative and quantitative data on parents 'and/or children 's satisfaction with the intervention, take-up, retention and adherence to the intervention and experiences of the intervention, the quality of the study was assessed and reported using the quality appraisal checklist of Hawker et al.66 It was not possible to blind the types of non-pharmacological interventions and comparators used in the studies under consideration. In addition, owing to the nature of the outcomes measured, robust, blinded outcome assessment was difficult. Although actigraphy-based child sleep outcomes are more objective than parent-reported measures, we did not consider these to be true objective outcomes, with non-blinding unlikely to introduce bias. Therefore, all of the measures were regarded as having the capacity to be influenced by lack of blinding. Analysis The synthesis aimed to: 1. Assess the clinical effectiveness of the interventions for sleep disturbance, in particular interventions that may work across conditions. 2. Inform future research by identifying gaps in the evidence and identifying interventions that are the most promising front runners to be considered for future primary research. First, narrative and tabular summaries of key study characteristics were undertaken. This allowed a mapping of which interventions have been investigated for which ND and for which type of sleep disturbance (e.g. sleep initiation) in order to identify interventions that have been investigated across conditions. We also mapped information on the feasibility and acceptability of each of the interventions. Synthesis involved paired meta-analyses and narrative synthesis. Meta-analyses Pharmacological intervention studies When sufficient data for our primary and secondary outcomes were available, they were pooled in quantitative synthesis using a random-effects model (for continuous outcomes). As data sets often included both parallel and crossover trials, or just crossover trials, data were pooled using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan version 5 (The Cochrane Collaboration, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark).67Only crossover trials with a washout period were included in meta-analyses, for which data from both treatment periods were used. For trials without a washout period, we considered using data from the first period only; however, in the event, this was not possible, as data summaries were not provided by treatment period for these trials. The recommendations provided in the Cochrane handbook were followed as closely as possible.68 The mean difference (MD) between melatonin (M) and placebo (P) at the end point was either taken as reported in the article or calculated as the difference in means for each group/period: MD=mean Mmean P. (1) When a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the group means was presented instead of a standard deviation (SD) (e.g. Garstang and Wallis69), the SD was calculated using the formula: SD= Np \u00d7 (upper confidence limit lower confidence limit)/(2 \u00d7 tvalue), (2) where the t-value was obtained by entering =tinv(1 -0.95, N-1) in a cell in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

The standard error (SE) of the MD was calculated using: SE (MD)=SD diff/ Np , (4) where Nis the sample size, or by dividing the MD by the t-statistic when this was presented for a two-sample t-test of the period differences (e.g. Weiss et al.70). To transform the parallel-group trial data for entry into the generic inverse variance facility, a two-sample t-test was conducted to calculate the unadjusted difference (and SE of the MD) between the groups at follow-up (post intervention) using raw group summary data ( N, mean and SD). Statistical heterogeneity between trials was assessed using the I2statistic.71Two sources of potential clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified for the pharmacological intervention trials, and subgroup analyses were conducted based on these, when appropriate: 1. type of neurological disorder -population primarily with ASD 2. receipt of prior intervention -whether or not participants were offered an additional intervention prior to the start of the study. The risk of publication bias was not formally assessed. When data could not be pooled, summaries of the findings for each trial and outcome are presented with a (estimated unadjusted) MD and 95% CI between melatonin and control at follow-up. Adverse event data are summarised narratively. Non-pharmacological intervention studies Non-pharmacological intervention studies included parallel-group RCTs and before-and-after studies. Owing to insufficient data for each outcome and/or significant heterogeneity in study design and intervention, data were not pooled in meta-analyses. Narrative and quantitative summaries of the findings for each trial and outcome are presented. For continuous data in the RCTs, the preferred choice was difference in end-point data; however, when a (estimated unadjusted) MD between intervention and control at follow-up could not be calculated, the difference in change scores from baseline to follow-up was presented instead. We had planned to undertake a mixed-treatment comparison of the multiple treatment options;72 however, this was not possible owing to the paucity of RCTs for interventions other than melatonin. Adverse event data are summarised narratively. Narrative synthesis Although we planned to undertake separate quantitative and qualitative syntheses, this was to a large extent not possible, as few studies could be pooled. With the exception of the melatonin trials, there was a large degree of variability between studies evaluating different classes of interventions. For example, forMETHODS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk12behavioural interventions, there was wide variability in aspects of the interventions such as mode of delivery, duration and intensity of interventions, as well as in the comparators used. There was also variability in the conditions being studied, outcomes reported and the measures used to assess individual outcomes, follow-up times and types of data reported. Consequently, there were few instances in which it became appropriate to pool the data. Thus, it became necessary to adopt a principally narrative synthesis to report the findings. We present a narrative synthesis as our main analysis, with comparisons made for melatonin versus placebo, which were the only interventions that we judged could be appropriately compared. Narrative synthesis was undertaken when quantitative synthesis was not appropriate or there were insufficient data, and applied mainly to the non-pharmacological interventions. When possible, we disp lay outcomes in a forest plot, even when studies are not statistically pooled, to aid exploration of study results. When feasible, we investigated the subgroup characteristics outlined previously. Non-pharmacological studies were grouped by type of intervention (i.e. comprehensive parent-directed tailored, comprehensiv e parent-directed non-tailored or non-comprehensive) and comparator if heterogeneous. We explored outcomes by type of sleep disturbance with the aim of identifying effects that may be transferable to other NDs. Results are discussed in the context of ratings of risk of bias in the individual studies. In terms of the qualitative data analysis, the topic areas that were subject to review were well defined; we therefore adopted a thematic approach to data extraction, analysis and synthesis.60,73To start, studies were grouped into pharmacological, behavioural and other non-pharmacological studies. For each, a descriptive report of relevant studies, and topic areas covered, was produced. The tabulated data were then scrutinised and analytical notes were made that summarised findings across studies with respect to the topic areas. Part of this process involved testing for contradictions in the evidence.74 The synthesis interrogated such data, when available, to assist in identifying interventions that could be generalisable across conditions and those that are condition specific.75,76Factors taken into consideration in identifying promising interventions included feasibility of delivery of the intervention in a NHS setting, acceptability to children and families, evidence of clinical effectiveness or in the direction of clinical effectiveness based on CIs (taking into consideration the clinical significance of the estimates). Protocol changes During the course of the review, we identified numerous RCTs for the melatonin studies. We therefore decided to include only RCTs for this intervention. For all other interventions, we have included any design except case studies, as per the original protocol. Some studies reported multiple case studies that were not eligible for inclusion in the review. We made the decision to exclude uncontrolled studies with fewer than 10 participants. Patient and public involvement Three parents of children with NDs (two mothers, one father) acted as project advisors. They were recruited from a permanent parent consultation group of the chief investigator 's research unit. These parents were invited to the project team meetings, which were held three times over the course of study and were attended by the research team and all co-applicants. Each parent attended at least one meeting. They were also consulted, via e-mail, regarding the implications of the findings of the review. The children 's diagnoses included autism and rare, genetic conditions. At the first meeting, an early item on the agenda was a presentation of an overview of systematic reviews as a research method. Throughout the meetings, the parents were encouraged to share their experiences and opinions, and their contributions provided useful contextual information.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

After removing duplicate references, 15,745 titles were screened. On the basis of titles, 14,420 titles were excluded; a further 937 were excluded on reading the abstract. Full-text articles were sought for the remaining 388 records. We could not obtain full-text articles for 30 of the records. Of these, 11 were conference abstracts that were not available in full text22,77-86and five were trial registry entries that were recorded as 'complete 'but had no study results available.87-91We contacted the authors to check whether or not there were any publications from the trials and received one response that the authors did not intend to publish the results as fewer than 10 participants had been recruited Records identified from trial registries (n = 194)Records identified through original database searching (n = 21,529)Screening Included Eligibility Identification Additional records identified from other sources (n = 6)Records after duplicates removed (n = 15,745) Records screened (n = 15,745)Records excluded (n = 15,357) Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n = 388) Included studies (n = 39, 64 articles)Records identified from update search (n = 1563) Full-text articles excluded, with reasons (n = 293) \u0081 Intervention, n = 117 \u0081 Study design, n = 110 \u0081 Population, n = 55 \u0081 Outcome, n = 6 \u0081 Trial registry entry already included in review, n = 5 \u0081 Could not be obtained, n = 30 FIGURE 1 Flow chart of the study selection process.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

One trial was registered as 'study status unknown '94with no published results; we contacted the authors but received no response. Five trials were eligible but ongoing so were excluded from the review as results were not yet available.95-99A further six articles could not be obtained from the British Library.100 -105 A total of 358 full-text articles were, therefore, assessed, including two non-English language papers that required translation. Of these, 117 articles (33%) were excluded because the intervention was out of scope or sleep disturbance was not the target of the intervention, 110 (31%) were excluded based on study design, 55 (15%) were excluded owing to the population, 6 (2%) were excluded based on the outcomes evaluated and 5 trials (1%) identified from trial registries were related to studies that had been completed and had already been identified through the searches and included in the review.36,48,49,106,107 Appendix 4 lists all studies excluded at full-text screening and reasons for exclusions. Overview of included studies There were 39 included studies reported in 64 articles. Although we sought to include studies published in any language, all the studies meeting the eligibility criteria were published in English. The included studies were from the UK ( n=13, RCTs investigated a pharmacological intervention, which in all cases was oral melatonin (Table 1 ). We did not identify any eligible pharmacological studies investigating clonidine or antihistamines. Twenty-six studies investigated non-pharmacological interventions, of which 12 were RCTs. Of these, nine (35%) evaluated parent-directed blankets ( n=1, 3%) plus a behavioural programme ( n=1, 3%). Thirteen studies explored feasibility and/or acceptability and/or parent/clinician views of sleep disturbance interventions.36,49,106,107,122 -130 The mean age of the children included in the studies ranged from 2 to 12 years. In 16 studies (41% ), participants were described in terms of a single ND diagnosis as follows: ADHD term with 'learning disability '; this is interchangeable with the term 'intellectual disability ')(n=2) and severe ND ( n=1). In 22 studies (56%), participants were reported to have two or more NDs. One study did not report participants 'NDs. There was also a range of sleep disturbance represented in the eligible studies. Owing to the different terminology used to describe sleep disturbances in the eligible st udies, we have classified sleep disturbance under the following headings: sleep initiation ( n=30, 77%) (e.g. sleep latency, sleep and insomnia); sleep maintenance ( n=26, 67%) (e.g. night waking, waking time, parasomnia, sleep fragmentations) and sleep scheduling ( n=1, 2.5%) (e.g. daytime sleepiness). Three studies (7%) reported that parents completed sleep questionnai res or assessment tools to determine their child 's eligibility, including the Sleep Behaviour Questionnaire,131Quine sleep index132and the Children 's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ).133Five studies (13%) did not specify the types of sleep disturbance eligible for inclusion. Children often had multiple sleep disturbanc es.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk16TABLE 1 Characteristics of studies of melatonin interventions Study details and designParticipants randomised (total N and by group) Trial treatments Sleep disturbance Mean age (SD) ND disorderPrevious sleep hygiene/ behavioural interventionsRisk placebo, n=76)Melatonin: mg, 45 minutes before bedtime for 12 weeks Placebo: matching capsule, 0.5 mg for 12 weeks Melatonin and placebo dose could be raised to 2 mg, 6 mg to 12 mg in first 4 weeks then maintainedProblems with sleep initiation and sleep maintenanceMelatonin: 106.0 months (34.8 months) Placebo: 100.7 months 3 mg at 21.00 hours for 12 weeks CBT: four, weekly individual sessions Melatonin and CBT: as above Placebo: identical tablet, 3 mg at 21.00 hours for 12 weeksProblems with sleep initiation and sleep maintenanceMelatonin: 6.8 years (0.9 years) Melatonin and CBT: 6.4 years (1.1 years) CBT: 7.1 years (0.7 years) Placebo: 6.3 years (1.2 years)ASD None stated High Van der Heijden et al.

Of the 13 RCTs evaluating oral melatonin, which were undertaken in Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA, 10 compared melatonin with placebo only; one compared melatonin, cognitive -behavioural therapy and a combination of the two with placebo; and two compared two regimens of melatonin (5 mg vs. 10 mg, and fast release vs. sustained release). Ten were crossover trials and three were parallel-group RCTs. Observed sample sizes ranged from 6 to 160 participants. Assessment of risk of bias A summary assessment of risk of bias for each RCT is provided in Table 1 and the full risk-of-bias assessment involving each bias domain is provided in Appendix 6 andReport Supplementary Material 1 . One trial was rated as having a low risk of bias.48The ratings of risk of bias in the remaining RCTs were high or unclear; therefore, the findings from these studies may not be robust. We could not locate a registered protocol for nine trials69,70,106,110,113 -115,117,119and one trial protocol was registered retrospectively,111making it unclear whether or not the studies were free of selective reporting. Seven studies provided no, or little, detail regarding sequence generation;70,106,111,113,114,117,119and four studies provided little or no detail regarding allocation concealment.110,113,114,119For three studies, how blinding was undertaken was unclear.69,70,113In three studies, the analysis of incomplete outcome data was not considered69,110or was unclear.114 Melatonin versus placebo Eleven trials therapy, oral melatonin plus cognitive -behavioural therapy and placebo.110 The washout period used by the crossover trials varied. One had no washout period,119one had a 1-month washout period106and the remaining five trials had a washout period of between 3 and 7 days.69,70,114,115,117 Camfield et al.113reported six 'Nof 1 'crossover trials with no washout period. Six of the trials varied drug dosages depending on the child 's age and/or weight and tolerance of dosage (see Table 1 ). The dose ranges were 0.5 -1m g ,1130.5-12 mg,483-6m g111and 2 -10 mg.106Fixed n=2),110,1195m g( n=4)69,70,114,117and 9 mg.115Matched placebos were used except for in one trial,70in which the placebo was not explicitly described, although in this trial the authors reported that each patient received a blister card of 30 days 'supply of medication. The length of time that melatonin was prescribed for varied between studies: 10 days,70,1172 weeks,114,119 4 weeks,69,111,1155 weeks113and 12 weeks.48,106,110 The age of participants included in these trials ranged from 1 to 18 years, although the mean age across studies was broadly similar, ranging from 5.5 to 10.3 years (see Table 1 ). The ND that was represented varied. Four trials included children with a mixed range of neurodevelopmental disabilities,48,113,114,117 three trials included only children with ASC,69,106,110two trials included children with ADHD,70,111one trial included children with ASD and/or fragile X syndrome119and one trial included children with epilepsy.115 The type of sleep disturbances reported in the participants also varied. Most trials had more than one criterion for inclusion in the trial and included children with a mix of sleep disturbances (see Table 1 ) relating to sleep initiation48,69,70,106,110,111,113,117and sleep maintenance.48,69,106,110,113,117However, two trials focused on a single sleep problem ( 'sleep onset insomnia '111and 'initial insomnia '70) and one trial required a score of>30 in the Sleep Behaviour Questionnaire.115Two studies did not specify the type of sleep problems eligible for inclusion.114,119RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk22Seven trials specified in their inclusion criteria that a preceding psychoeducational or behavioural sleep management intervention had to have been ineffective.48,69,70,106,113,114,117In five of these trials, guidance on sleep was provided as part of the trial in the form of a behaviour therapy advice booklet,48tailored sleep hygiene advice,117a sleep hygiene intervention,70a sleep hygiene advice leaflet69and behaviour management and parenting support.106In four of these trials, only children who continued to experience sleep problems were randomised.48,70,106,117 Across these 11 trials, 19 sleep-related outcomes were measured (see Appendix 7 ). The most commonly measured outcomes were total sleep time (TST) ( n=11), sleep Additional outcomes included arousals, bedtime, CSHQ, difficulty falling asleep, sleep onset, time from drug to sleep, longest sleep episode, the Sleep Behaviour Questionnaire, percentage of sleep stages, wake after sleep onset (WASO), nights without awakening, wake-up time, naptime, moving time, 'interdaily stability ','interdaily variability 'and 'L5'(average activity during the least active 5 hours). Definitions of outcome measures can be found in Appendix 7 . All trials had follow-up periods that commenced immediately following the completion of the intervention: 10 days,70,1172 weeks,114,1194 weeks,69,111,11510 weeks113or 12 weeks.48,106,110 Global measures and composite scores Total sleep time All 11 trials48,69,70,106,110,111,113 -115,117,119(n=589 randomised participants) assessed TST (see Appendix 7 ); four measured this using parent-reported sleep diaries only,69,106,113,114whereas the remaining seven48,70,110,111,115,117,119 used both actigraphy and sleep diaries. However, of these, three report only actigraphy -measured TST data,110,111,119as the sleep diaries were used purely to inform, or verify, actigraphy data. This follows existing guidance on the interpretation of actigraphy data.134The remaining four trials48,70,115,117reported TST derived from both parent-completed sleep diaries and actigraphy data. Data from seven trials using sleep diary-reported TST were pooled: six the forest plot ( Figure 2 ), the sample sizes presented count participants in crossover trials twice (as being in the melatonin and placebo groups), so the figures reported in the text and shown in the figures may not match for this reason. There was a statistically significant increase in sleep diary-reported TST with melatonin compared with placebo (pooled MD 29.6 minutes, 95% CI 6.9 to 52.4 minutes; p=0.01; 2 and3). Statistical heterogeneity was high ( I2=97%) and this treatment effect is unlikely to be generalisable, although the effect estimates were all in the direction of benefit with melatonin. Heterogeneity was reduced when studies were stratified based on whether or not the study population was exclusively ASD or not (test for subgroup differences: p<0.001; I2=99%); there was a pooled MD of 64.7 minutes (95% CI 58.8 to 70.7 minutes, I2=0%) for the studies of ASD ( n=24), and a smaller pooled MD of 15.9 minutes (95% CI 9.2 to 22.6 minutes, I2=31%) for the studies of mixed or other populations ( n=208). There was only a single study ( n=9) in which participants had no prior sleep hygiene or behavioural intervention limiting the usefulness of this subgroup analysis; the overall results did not substantially change with removal of this study (pooled MD 33.0 minutes, 95% CI 8.6 to 57.4 minutes, n=223; Figure 3 ). When the single trial rated as having a low risk of bias is considered alone, the increase in sleep time with melatonin was 13.2 minutes (95% CI -13.3 to 39.7 minutes).48 The study of six 'Nof 1 'trials in six participants also reported sleep diary TST but, owing to the unusual trial design, could not be included in the meta-analysis.113The authors reported no 'notable difference in sleep pattern or daytime behaviour between melatonin and placebo weeks '113and provided raw data for each participant. From this, we calculated the MD between melatonin and placebo for parent-reported TST to be 13.9 minutes in favour of the group (95% CI -6.8 to 34.6 minutes; p=0.14).DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

These data are summarised in Table 2 . Melatonin versus controlled-release with fast-release melatonin, and Hancock et al.120compared a dose regimen of 5 mg with a dose regimen 10 mg of melatonin. Janet al.121did not have a washout period between the two intervention phases, whereas Hancock et al.120 had a 2-week washout period. Hancock et al.120compared a fixed-dose regimen of 5 mg with 10 mg of melatonin regardless of the child 's age. The authors did not report whether or not the melatonin was controlled or fast release. The final average dose for controlled-release melatonin for Jan et al.121was 5.7 mg (range 2 -12 mg), and the final average dose for fast-release melatonin was 7 mg (range 2 -15 mg). Janet al.121reported that the dosage for fast-release melatonin varied for each child depending on the dosage deemed by the trial team to be most effective for that child. However, the controlled-release melatonin was approximately 50% of the fast-release dose, which the authors stated was to avoid possible adverse side effects, as they had no previous information on the use of controlled-release melatonin in children. The duration of the intervention was 11 days for Jan et al.121and 2 weeks for Hancock et al.120 The age of participants included in the trials ranged from 18 months to 31 years for Han cock et al.120(eligible participants<18 years, n=5, mean age 6.9 years); and from 4 to 21 years for Jan et al.121(eligible participants <18 years, n=15, mean age 9.3 years). Children in Hancock et al.120had severe neurodevelopmental difficulties, whereas the ND in the Jan et al.121study was tuberous sclerosis. The sleep disturbance in both studies focused on both sleep initiation and maintenance: in Hancock et al.120'severe sleep problems ', confirmed by a Quine sleep index score of at least 6 out of a possible 8, and for Jan et al.121'chronic wake -sleep disorders '. In Jan et al.,121the inclusion criterion was that children had already been treated with fast-release melatonin for >3 months but slept for <5-6 hours.

Hancock et al.120measured TST, SOL and number of night wakings, whereas Jan et al.121measured 'changes in sleep pattern 'as their only outcome. The results of these outcomes are summarised in Table 3 for participants aged <18 years. Each outcome measure was reported by a single study. There was no evidence of benefit on any of the sleep-related outcomes for the RCT that compared controlled-release melatonin with fast-release melatonin121or the RCT that compared a dose of 5 mg of melatonin with 10 mg of melatonin.120 Adverse events Eleven out of the 13 trials measured adverse events,48,70,106,110,111,114,115,117,119 -121which were collected and reported in different ways across the studies ( Table 4 ). One study reported adverse event data using the standardised assessment tool 'treatment-emergent signs and symptoms ', which classified events into seven domains: somnolence, increased excitability, mood swings, seizures, rash, hypothermia and cough.48Signs and symptoms were graded as 'no symptoms ','mild symptoms ','moderate symptoms 'and 'severe symptoms '. Seriousness and causality were also assessed. In two studies,110,115adverse events were determined at each in-person/telephone call visit by the study team and recorded in the participant 's chart; one study measured adverse events using study-specific questionnaires completed by parents;106one reported using a standardised form;70one reported using parent-completed questionnaires, in which the origin of the questionnaire was not reported;114two reported measuring adverse events using open-ended interviews;111,117one study reported only that adverse effects were reported by parents;120and in one study it was unclear how the data were collected.119TABLE 2 Other outcome results from studies of pharmacological interventions ( continued ) Study OutcomeTime point, mean (SD) MD between melatonin and placebo (95% CI) Baseline Follow-up Jainet al.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.39Three trials reported that no adverse events were observed or reported during the trial.110,119,121Further details of the adverse events reported can be found in Table 4 . Overall, melatonin was tolerated and the adverse event profile appeared to be similar between the melatonin and placebo groups. Summary Eleven RCTs (eight crossover and three parallel trials) compared melatonin, of varying doses and duration, with placebo. The mean age of participants ranged from 5.5 to 10.3 years and some studies included children with a single ND, whereas others included mixed populations. Children had mostly sleep initiation and/or sleep maintenance problems and in the majority of studies had been offered a prior intervention, ranging from a sleep hygiene advice leaflet to behaviour management and parenting support. Only three child-related sleep outcomes were reported by more than half of the studies, with many of the additional outcomes assessed by a single study. None of the studies assessed parent-related outcomes. One study was assessed as having a low risk of bias, with the remaining studies having an unclear or high risk of bias. When possible, studies were grouped in the synthesis by ND (ASD vs. mixed or other groups) and by whether or not they had received a prior intervention. However, the results of the subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution, rather than be considered definitive, as they are based on summary data and are, therefore, observational rather than randomised comparisons as in a trial. In addition, some of the subgroups contained a particularly small number of studies. There was evidence of benefit with melatonin compared with placebo, although the precise extent of the benefit, which children might benefit the most and the clinical importance of the benefit remain uncertain. The overall benefit was similar for diary-reported and actigraphy-recorded TST. Based on two small studies of children with ASD, there was a mean increase in diary-recorded TST of 64.78 minutes with melatonin compared with placebo (95% CI 58.8 to 70.7 minutes); for the five mixed or other ND studies, the mean increase was 15.9 minutes (95% CI 9.2 to 22.6 minutes). For the single study that was rated as having a low risk of bias (mixed population), the mean increase in TST was 13.2 minutes and the lower CI included the possibility of reduced sleep time (95% CI -13.3 to 39.7 minutes). The findings were similar for SOL. The benefit was greatest for the ASD studies in which there was a mean reduction of 50.9 minutes (95% CI -55.5 to -46.2 minutes) in diary-measured SOL, based on two small studies, whereas there was a smaller mean reduction of 27.4 minutes (95% CI -39.1 to -15.7 minutes) for the mixed and other population subgroup. For the single study with a low risk of bias (mixed population), the mean reduction in SOL was 37.5 minutes (95% CI -58.9 to -16.1 minutes). For other outcomes, there was some evidenceTABLE 4 Adverse events in studies evaluating melatonin ( continued ) Study AEs Method of collection Wright et al. (2011)106Authors report that there were no statistically significant differences between treatment and placebo in the frequencies of reported side effects (but do not give actual numbers), including the following: daytime drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, vomiting, tummy aches, reduced appetite, low mood, anxiety, irritability, reduced alertness, confusion, tearfulness, diarrhoea, constipation, rashes, sort throat, ear aches, asthma, fit/seizure, mild tremor and 'other '. Daytime drowsiness, reduced appetite, reduced alertness and diarrhoea were reported as 'never present 'more often in the placebo than treatment group, but the difference was not statistically significant. There were no serious AEs One child stopped medication during an influenza episode and did not continue as sleep 'continued to be good '. There were no known reports of seizures or asthma during the trial. One child displayed increased moodiness and self-injurious behaviour but clinicians reported that these were long-standing problems for the childStudy-specific questionnaire AE, adverse event.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk40of statistically significant benefit with melatonin for sleep initiation outcomes but not sleep maintenance outcomes, such as number of night wakings, although some of the single studies may not have been sufficiently powered to detect an effect. A single RCT121compared controlled-release and fast-release melatonin and one RCT120compared a 5 mg and a 10 mg dose of melatonin, both with a high risk of bias. There was no evidence of benefit with either strategy. Non-pharmacological studies Study characteristics Twenty-six studies evaluated non-pharmacological interventions: 12 RCTs, one controlled before-and-after study and 13 uncontrolled before-and-after studies. Sample sizes ranged from 5 to 244 participants. Studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, the UK and the USA. A summary of key characteristics is provided in Table 5 and further details are provided in Appendix 9 . We grouped studies, based on the intervention, into the following: parent-directed Intervention and control details for non-pharmacological studies are outlined in Appendix 10 . Parent-directed interventions can be conceived as psychoeducational interventions that have the objective of 'training 'parents to manage their child 's sleep disturbance by equipping th em with the relevant knowledge and skills. These interventions vary in their intensity and di fferent modes are used to deli ver the training, including individual work, group work, teaching workshops and written material. Nineteen studies21,49,107,123-129,138,146,149,151,152, 155,162,163of parent-directed interventions were included in the review. The interventions varied considerably in terms of a number of characteristics. There was no consistency in the terminology used by study authors to describe the interventions, and the terms that were used to describe an intervention were not routinely defined. This was not unexpected. Generally, reporting of non-pharmacological interventions is acknowledged to be much poorer than for pharmacological studies.164However, it carries the risk o f erroneous comparison of interventions or pooling of studies. Therefore, a framework to describe th e parent-directed interventions repr esented in this study was developed by the research team. It included intervention characteristics posited as being an 'active ingredient 'of an intervention and/or having an impact on intervention effectiveness, for example, intensity, duration, mode of delivery and whether the intervention was condition specific or ND generic. There was incomplete reporting on these intervention characteristics across the studies. We defined tailored and non-tailor ed interventions as follows: lTailored -a face-to-face clinical assessment by a trained practitioner guides clinical decision-making regarding the management of a specific child 's sleep disturbance. A sleep management plan specific to the child/family is developed, and training in implementing that plan is delivered. There is extended 'implementation support ', that is, ongoing support and advice as the parents implement changes to sleep management strategies and practices. The intervention is typically delivered on a one-to-one basis. However, an intervention that used teaching workshops and one-to-one work was also categorised as tailored123,124because it fulfilled the criteria defined above. lNon-tailored -the delivery of a standard 'training curriculum '. The curriculum may include opportunities for a parent to be supported to operationalise the material learnt for their child 's sleep disturbance. Some implementation support may also be included. Among the studies included in this review, such interventions were delivered in a number of ways: written material, single-session workshops, group delivery and one-to-one work.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

The remaining two interventions, which were classified as non-comprehensive parent-directed interventions, focused on a single topic area related to managing sleep disturbance. One was concerned only with sleep hygiene training155and the other focused on particular behavioural strategies to manage specific problem behaviours.152 Assessment of risk of bias A summary assessment of risk of bias for each RCT is provided in Table 5 and the full risk-of-bias assessment involving each bias domain is provided in Appendix 21 . Overall, the studies were rated as having a risk of bias that was high ( n=24) or unclear ( n=2); therefore, the findings from these studies may not be robust. Following the guidance outlined in Chapter 2 ,Assessment of risk bias , one study was rated as having a high risk of bias, as blinded outcome assessment was not possible.138However, this study had no other important limitations and all other domains were rated as having a low risk of bias. We were unable to find a registered protocol for 10 RCTs,21,36,49,107,124,125,127,128,152,156making it unclear whether or not the studies were free of selective reporting. Eight trials provided little or no detail regarding sequence generation.21,36,49,107,124,127,152,157Ten RCTs provided little or no detail regarding allocation concealment.21,36,49,107,124,125,127,128,152,156In all RCTs, blinded outcome assessment was not undertaken21,36,49,107, 125,127,128,138,152or it was unclear whether or not blinding occurred.124,156In eight RCTs, the analysis of incomplete outcome data was not considered21,36,125,128,152or it was unclear whether or not the authors had considered this.107,124,127 Eleven non-randomised designs21,123,126,146,149,155,159 -163were reported as having a risk of bias owing to a probable or unclear risk of confounding of the effect of the intervention. Fourteen studies were reported as having a risk of bias because of how they selected participants, for example by not reporting inclusion and/or exclusion criteria, selecting participants from one setting only or including more males than females.21,123,126, 129,146,149,151,155,158 -163There was likely or unclear bias reported in the measurement of intervention outcomes in seven studies, for example few or no details provided about how outcomes were measured.21,126,146,159 -161 One further study160was reported as having unclear bias because of departures from intended interventions, owing to missing data and to the selection of the reported results. Parent-directed tailored interventions Nine studies evaluated parent-directed, comprehensive tailored interventions ( Table 6 ). Seven studies evaluated the clinical effectiveness of these interventions: three two-armed parallel-group RCTs107,124,138 with a range of no intervention comparators (i.e. usual care, waiting list control or non-sleep related parent education); and four before-and-after studies.21,123,126,146Two further RCTs21,125evaluated alternative ways of delivering an intervention. One compared the mode by which implementation support was provided: home visit versus telephone call.21The other compared the intensity of practitioner involvement when delivering the intervention: brief versus extended.125 Six studies included children with a range of neurodevelopmental conditions,21,123,124,126,146two included children with a diagnosis of ADHD125,138and one included children with a diagnosis of ASD.107 Interventions varied in terms of the total number of sessions delivered; the number of sessions spent in assessment; the development of, and training in, a sleep management plan; the duration of the intervention; and the mode of delivery (see Table 6 ). The number of assessment/training sessions ranged from one21,138to five107sessions in the RCTs; and from two21,146to four sessions123,126in the other study designs. In the RCTs, the intervention duration was one session,1254 weeks138and 10 weeks,21and was not reported in two studies.107,124In the other studies,21,123,126,146the duration of the intervention ranged from 6 to 28 weeks.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk50TABLE 6 Details of parent-directed tailored interventions StudyTotal duration of intervention (including period of implementation support) Mode of deliveryNumber of sessions and locationMode of delivering implementation support, and intensity, once regular sessions with practitioner were completedIntervention described as developed for specific ND?

Two RCTs excluded children who were already receiving specialist sleep input138or who were using sleep supplements.107One RCT124reported that children were taking medication prescribed for behaviour and sleep problems; however, it was not clear if melatonin was being taken to aid sleep. One before-and-after study126reported that one child was taking medication for behaviour and sleep problems. Twenty-seven different sleep-related outcomes were measured (see Appendices 11 -13). First outcome measurement time points ranged from immediately post intervention to 2 months post intervention (see Table 6 ). Five trials measured additional follow-up time points; however, in this review we focus only on the outcomes closest to the end of the intervention. Given the variation in interventions in terms of, for example, number of sessions, implementation support and mode of delivery, as well as differences in comparator and length of follow-up, a narrative synthesis was undertaken of the parent-directed tailored interventions. Disorder global measures and composite scores Total sleep time Two RCTs ( TST. However, because of the way in which data were reported, we are unable to cal culate the MD from pre to post intervention or a CI.126Sleep management interventions seek to increase duration of TST. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in change in actigraphy-measured TST from baseline to post intervention for a tailored parent-directed intervention compared with usual care (MD 10.9 minutes, 95% CI -19.0 to 40.8 minutes).138There was also no difference between the comparator and intervention groups post intervention for a group receiving a tailored parent-directed intervention compared with non-sleep-related parent education (MD 26.0 minutes, 95% CI RCTs ( n=284)107,138reported actigraphy-measured sleep efficiency, that is, the ratio of TST to total time in bed, informed by or verified using sleep diaries. Greater sleep efficiency is preferable. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in change in actigraphy-measured sleep efficiency from baseline to post intervention for a tailored parent-directed intervention compared with usual care (MD -1.6%, 95% CI -5.2% to 1.9%),138or in the difference between groups post intervention for a tailored parent-directed intervention compared with non-sleep-related parent education (MD -1.0%, 95% CI -7.6% to 5.6%).107 The Children 's Four RCTs ( n=310)21,124,125,138and two before-and-after studies21,123reported the CSHQ total score. CSHQ is a validated parent-reported assessment of child sleep.133Higher scores on the CSHQ indicate aRESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk52greater severity of the sleeping disturbance, either because of the frequency or number of different behaviours presenting. There was a statistically significant reduction (i.e. improvement) in total CSHQ score in one RCT of a parent-directed tailored intervention compared with a usual care control. However, Hiscock et al. ,138in another RCT, found no statistically significant improvement using a parent-directed tailored intervention compared with waiting list control,124although the direction of effect was in a positive direction. No evidence of a difference was observed in the RCTs of extended versus brief intervention125and face-to-face implementation support compared with telephone-delivered implementation support,21although the direction of effect was the same ( Table 7 ). There was a decrease (i.e. an improvement) in total CSHQ score post intervention compared with pre intervention in one before-and-after study;123however, it was not possible to estimate the MD between pre and post intervention in a second study as it was not a matched sample.21 TABLE 7 Outcome results for CSHQ score in parent-directed tailored interventions StudyTime point, mean CSHQ score (SD) MD CI) Baseline RCTs Beresford group: 57.8 group: 59.0 points (7.8 points)Intervention group: 50.1 points (8.3 1.59 (2011)125NR Intervention group: (change score) 5.09 points (5.12 points) Control group: (change score) 6.82 points (8.02 points)-1.73 points (-7.11 to 3.65 points)c Before-and-after studies Austin et (2013)12355.43 (7.68 (9.14 points) (2012)2159.55 (7.59 points) 56.57 points (10.77 points) Cannot be estimated.d Effect size given as 0.42 NR, not reported. a Estimated unadjusted difference at follow-up (post intervention) between intervention and control group for RCTs and change from pre to post intervention for before-and-after studies. b Reported in paper. c Difference in change scores from baseline to 2 months between intervention and control groups. d As not a matched sample ( n=11 pre intervention and n=7 post intervention).DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

One RCT138 (n=244) of a tailored parent-directed intervention compared with usual care reported a sta tistically significant reduction in parent-reported moderate or severe sleep problems ( Table 8 ). There appeared to be improvement at follow-up in three further outcomes measured in two before-and-after studie s (see Table 8 ).21,123 Sleep initiation Sleep onset latency One RCT ( n=40)107reported actigraphy-measured SOL, the time from bedtime to sleep onset time, which was verified using sleep diaries. One before-and-after study reported on SOL using sleep diaries123and another reported SOL using parent-completed visual graphs.126 There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in SOL in the RCT107of a tailored parent-directed intervention compared with non-sleep-related parent education (MD 4 minutes, 95% CI -15.0 to 23.0 minutes). One before-and-after study showed no statistically significant difference pre and post intervent ion (MD 43 minutes, 95% CI -30 to 116 minutes).123The results reported in the other study126are based on visual graphs without any associated numerical data; therefore, we are unable to present a MD and CI. Other sleep initiation outcomes Two further before-and-after studies measured time to settle at night. One reported a statistically significant improvement in time to settle at night (MD -91.3 minutes, 95% CI -112.6 to -69.9 minutes)146 and the other did not report data for any sleep initiation outcomes.126 TABLE 8 Other global and composite outcomes of parent-directed tailored interventions Study OutcomeTime period, mean (SD) MD (95% CI) Baseline Follow-up RCTs Hiscock et al.

Other sleep maintenance outcomes A variety of other outcomes related to sleep maintenance were reported by single studies. One RCT138 (n=244) reported WASO (night waking duration and/or frequency after the child falls asleep) and found no evidence of a statistically significant difference between a tailored parent-directed intervention and usual care ( Table 9 ). Another RCT125(n=27) comparing an extended versus brief intervention found that there was a greater reduction (i.e. now 'no'or only a 'mild 'sleep problem) in sleep problems at 2 months for the extended intervention group compared with the brief intervention group. One before-and-after study146reported statistically significant improvements in mean minutes per night the child was awake, and number of nights the child does not sleep in their own bed. Another before-and-after study126reported measuring the number of nights per week that the child fell asleep in their own bed and the number of nights per week that the child co-slept; however, the authors reported insufficient data to determine the effects of the intervention on these outcomes (see Table 9 ).

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms Two RCTs ( n=271)125,138reported on the severity of ADHD symptoms using the total score of the ADHD Rating Scale IV,165which is a validated parent- or teacher-completed questionnaire that has been used to assess the presence and severity of symptoms by parents/carers of children with ADHD. A higher score indicates more severe problems. The authors of a RCT125comparing an extended versus brief parent-directed tailored intervention reported only that there was 'minimal change in ADHD symptoms . . . across both groups at 2 and 5 months '.125 There was a statistically significant reduction in symptom severity as measured by the parent-reported ADHD Rating Scale IV in another RCT138comparing a tailored parent-directed intervention with usual care (adjusted MD -3.7 points, 95% CI -6.1 to -1.2 points, 95% CI -6.5 to -0.5 points). However, the difference in the teacher-reported ADHD Rating Scale IV score was not statistically significant at 3 months 'follow-up (adjusted MD -2.4 points, 95% CI -5.3 to 0.4 unadjusted MD -5.3 points, 95% CI -9.2 to -1.4 points). Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Two RCTs125,138(n=271) reported on the child 's quality of life using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) version 4.0. The PedsQL is a validated parent-completed questionnaire that assesses parents ' perception of quality of life in paediatric patients with chronic health conditions. Higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life. There was a statistically significant improvement in the PedsQL in one RCT138comparing a tailored parent- directed intervention with usual care (adjusted MD 9.4 points, 95% CI 5.6 to 13.2 points; unadjusted MD 10.6 points, 95% CI 6.0 to 15.2 points). In the other RCT, there was no statistically significant difference in change scores from baseline to 2 months between groups receiving the extended versus brief formats of a parent-directed tailored intervention on the PedsQL (MD 4.27 points, 95% n=297) of parent-directed tailored interventions reported other child-related quality of life, daytime behaviour and cognition outcomes.124,125,138These data are summarised in Table 10 . Hiscock et al.138reported statistically significant improvements in the Daily Parent Rating on the Evening and Morning Behaviour Scale score, in parent- and teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scores and in backwards digit recall, a parent-directed tailored intervention, compared with the usual care control group.138Another RCT124reported that there was no statistically significant difference in the Developmental Behaviour Checklist when comparing a parent-directed tailored intervention with waiting list control. A third RCT125found that there was no statistically significant difference between extended and brief format sessions in the Daily Parent Rating on the Evening and Morning Behaviour Scale score. For the before-and-after studies, one123reported a statistically significant improvement in the Developmental Behaviour Checklist166post intervention. A second before-and-after study146evaluated child daytime behaviour and cognition using the Behavior Problem Index (BPI)167and reported a statistically significant reduction in total BPI score. A third before-and-after study126evaluated children 's sleep behaviour goals and reported improvements post intervention, although we were unable to report the MD and CI, as the authors provided insufficient data to enable this.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk56TABLE 10 Other outcomes of parent-directed tailored interventions Study OutcomeTime point, mean (SD) MD (95% CI) Baseline Follow-up Child-related quality of life, daytime behaviour and cognition RCTs Hiscock et al.

Parents of children in the intervention group were less likely than parents of children in the control group to seek help for their child 's sleep from a health professional (e.g. general practitioner, paediatrician or psychologist) (14% vs. 20% at 3 months), but this difference was not statistically significant. School attendance Two RCTs ( n=271) reported on school attendance, defined as the number of days missed from school.125,138 Both reported only that there was no difference in this outcome between the intervention groups.125,138 Parent-related outcomes Three RCTs124,125,138and one before-and-after study146reported parent-carer-related outcomes. The outcomes measured and methods of assessment are summarised in Appendix 12 . Depression Anxiety Stress Scales Two RCTs ( n=271) reported on parental stress using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS).125,138The DASS are a validated self-report instrument designed to measure the three related negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and tension/stress. Higher scores indicate worse depression, anxiety and stress. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the DASS for a parent-directed tailored intervention compared with usual care (adjusted MD -5.3 points, 95% CI -13.0 to 2.4 points; unadjusted MD points, 95% CI -13.1 to 2.5 points).138Sciberras et al.125found no evidence of a statistically significant difference in change scores from baseline to month 5 (data not available for 2-month follow-up) between the extended and brief intervention groups (MD 1.82 points, 95% CI -1.03 to 4.67 points). Other parent-/carer-related outcomes of tailored Two RCTs before-and-after study146reported other parent-/carer-related outcomes of parent-directed tailored interventions. These data are summarised in Table 11 . These outcomes focused on parental stress and morale124,146and parent work attendance.125 There was a statistically significant reduction (i.e. improvement) in the Parenting Stress Index -Short Form when comparing a parent-directed tailored intervention with a waiting list control.124Another RCT125 found a statistically significant difference in parent work attendance for an extended versus a brief version of a parent-directed tailored intervention. The before-and-after study found both a statistically significant reduction in maternal stress, as measured by the Malaise Inventory, and an improvement in maternal morale, as measured by the Cantrill ladder, from pre to post intervention.146 Measures of perceived parenting confidence and/or efficacy and/or understanding of sleep/sleep management One RCT21and two before-and-after studies21,146reported on measures of perceived parenting confidence and/or efficacy and/or understanding of sleep/sleep management. Details of how these were measured are summarised in Appendix 13 . Parenting Sense of Competence scale and satisfaction and efficacy subscales One RCT ( n=13)21and one before-and-after Competence (PSOC) scale.168The PSOC scale is a validated self-completed questionnaire. A higher score indicates a higher sense of parenting competence.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk58No evidence of a statistically significant difference was found in the RCT comparing modes of delivering implementation support (face to face vs. telephone) for either the satisfaction (MD 6.17 points, 95% CI -5.75 to 18.09 points) or the efficacy (MD -0.50 points, 95% CI -9.66 to 8.66 points) subscales of the PSOC scale.21Both satisfaction and efficacy subscale scores increased post intervention in the before-and- after study; however, a MD and CI was not calculated, as the summary data presented were not reported for a matched sample pre and post intervention.21 Other measures of perceived confidence and/or efficacy and/or understanding of sleep/sleep management One before-and-after study146measured improvement in parental knowledge of behavioural principles using the Knowledge of Behavioural Principles as Applied to Children test.169The Knowledge of Behavioural Principles as Applied to Children test is a validated multiple choice instrument that assesses verbal understanding of basic behavioural principles. Higher scores indicate better knowledge scores. There was a significant improvement between pre and post intervention in the parents 'knowledge scores (MD 2.2 points, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.7 points). Summary Nine studies evaluated parent-directed, comprehensive tailored interventions.21,107,123 -126,138,146There were five RCTs,21,107,124,125,138three of which107,124,138were rated as having a high risk of bias and compared the intervention with usual care or other control, one125of which was rated as having a high risk of bias and compared brief with extended versions of an intervention and another of which21was rated as having a high risk of bias and compared different modes of delivering implementation support. There were also four before-and-after studies21,123,126,146that were rated as having a high or an unclear risk of bias. The mean age of participants ranged from 2.7 to 12.1 years. The majority of studies21,123 -126,138,146included children with a mixed range of NDs, with three studies107,125,146including children with a single condition. The majority of studies21,107,123,126,146also included children with a mix of sleep disturbances, mainly sleep initiation and/or sleep maintenance problems.TABLE 11 Other parent-/carer-related outcomes of parent-directed tailored interventions Study OutcomeTime point, mean (SD) MD (95% CI) Baseline Follow-up RCTs et NR 'At three months, intervention parents reported fewer days late for work as a result of their child 's behaviour than control parents (p=0.02, non-parametric test for trend) and fewer missed days at work ( p=0.03) ' Before-and-after studies Quine and Wade (1991)146Maternal stress (Malaise Inventory)6.4 points (4.1 points)3.8 points (2.8 points)-2.6 ( ladder)6.7 points (2.2 points)7.6 points (1.3 points)0.9 points (0.2 to 1.6 points)a NR, not reported. a Estimated unadjusted difference at follow-up between intervention and control group for RCTs and change from pre to post intervention for before-and-after studies.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

Overall, there was mixed evidence about the effects of parent-directed tailored interventions compared with usual care or other control, with limited evidence of benefit on more objective actigraphy child-related sleep outcomes and more evidence of benefit on parent-reported child outcomes and a few parent outcomes. Conclusions are hampered by the limited number of RCTs, the multitude of outcome measures and the risk of studies being underpowered to detect an effect. A single study138was rated as having a low risk of bias for all domains except for blinding, as the outcomes may have been influenced by the lack of blinded outcome assessment. This RCT138of a parent-directed comprehensive tailored intervention (with implementation support) compared with usual care, which provided the best available evidence identified, reported a small increase in TST in favour of the intervention, but the lower CI covered the possibility of worsening of TST (MD 10.9 minutes, 95% CI -19.0 to 40.8 minutes). A second RCT of a parent-directed comprehensive tailored intervention (with implementation support) compared with usual care had a similar finding (MD 26.0 minutes, 95% CI -35.1 to 87.1 minutes).107There was also no statistically significant improvement in other actigraphy-measured sleep outcomes with the intervention compared with control (sleep efficiency, WASO, SOL), measured by either or both studies. There was a statistically significant improvement in child sleep habits (CSHQ) and in parent-reported child sleep problems in one of these studies,138as well as child behaviour and quality of life (parent-reported ADHD Rating Scale IV, PedsQL, Parent Daily Reporting of Morning and Evening Behaviour). The third RCT124reported no statistically significant difference in child behaviour (Developmental Behaviour checklist). One RCT138reported no statistically significant improvement in parental stress (DASS) with the intervention compared with control, whereas another RCT124reported a statistically significant improvement (Parenting Stress Index -Short Form). The four before-and-after studies21,123,126,146showed improvement across several child-related and parent-related outcomes. Based on a single RCT,21there was no statistically significant difference in the clinical effectiveness of home-delivered compared with telephone-based implementation support on child sleep outcomes (CSHQ) or parental outcomes (PSOC scale). Based on a single RCT,125there was a statistically significant improvement in parental work attendance and parent-reported child sleep problems with an extended versus brief intervention but no difference for multiple other child-related and parent-related outcomes. Parent-directed non-tailored interventions Eight studies evaluated the delivery of a standard 'training curriculum '. The curriculum may include opportunities for a parent to be supported to operationalise the material learnt for their child 's sleep disturbance. Some implementation support may also be included. The interventions varied in terms of the number of training sessions, the mode of delivery and the provision of implementation support. The number of sessions ranged from zero (leaflet provision only)127to two for the RCTs49and from one149,163to three and four sessions for the before-and-after studies.129,151,162The duration of the intervention was relatively short for RCTs, up to 2 weeks,128but was longer for the before-and-after studies, ranging from a single session149,163to 7 weeks.151Interventions also varied in terms of whether or not 'implementation support 'was provided to parents. Some did not offer any implementation support ( n=3), some offered it during training sessions only ( n=2) and others also offered it for a time-limited period after all the sessions had been completed ( n=3). The curricula of four of the interventions included the opportunity within sessions for parents to operationalise learning for their child 's specific sleep problem.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk60TABLE 12 Overview of non-tailored interventions and study design StudyTotal duration of interventionIntervention details (active arms only) Was the intervention described as having been developed for a specific ND?

The mode of delivery was in booklet format for two RCTs49,127and was face to face for the third RCT, which was supplemented with two weekly telephone calls.128The mode of intervention delivery for the before-and-after studies was predominantly in group format, apart from in one study.149Implementation support was included in two before-and-after studies, which took the form of telephone calls for 3 days following the initial session for one study149and weekly for 4 weeks for the other.151 The comparators in the three trials were no intervention,127individual versus group delivery of an intervention128 and, in a three-arm trial, written material versus face-to- face delivery of material versus no intervention control.49 For four interventions, study authors reported that the content of the intervention was informed by the nature of the target population, namely children with ASDs. One RCT and three before-and-after studies included children with a range of NDs.49,149,162,163Two RCTs and two before-and-after studies included children with ASD only.127 -129,151 The age of participants ranged from 2 to 5.9 years in the RCTs,49,127,128and from 4.8 to 8.9 years for the before-and-after studies.129,149,151,162,163Children in the RCTs had problems with sleep initiation127,128and problems with both sleep initiation and maintenance.49Children in the before-and-after studies had problems with both sleep initiation and maintenance, with the exception of one study.162Only one study149 reported on whether or not the child had received any prior interventions. Table 12 provides an overview of the studies evaluating the non-tailored parent training interventions. The RCTs49,127,128reported on five outcomes and the before-and-after studies129,149,151,162,163reported on 10 outcomes. The most commonly reported outcome measures used were the CSHQ,127 -129,151,162,163TST,127,128,151 SOL,127,128,149,151WASO127,128,151and child daytime behaviour.128,129,149,151No studies measured child cognition outcomes. Sixteen different sleep-related outcomes were measured (see Appendices 14 -16). The first outcome measurement time points ranged from 2 weeks to 7 weeks from baseline (see Table 12 ). Four trials149,151,162,163 measured additional follow-up time points; however, in this review, we focus only on the outcomes closest to the end of the intervention. Given the variations in intervention characteristics (e.g. mode of delivery, number of sessions, availability of implementation support), study design and study objectives, it was not considered appropriate to pool the RCT data. Therefore, the studies are described in a narrative synthesis. Child-related outcomes The outcomes measured and methods of assessment are summarised in Appendix 14 . Global measures and composite scores Total sleep time Two ( n=116)127,128and one before-and-after study ( n=25)129evaluated actigraphy-measured TST informed by the use of sleep diaries following existing guidance on the interpretation of actigraphy data.134 In one of the RCTs,127no evidence of a statistically significant difference in actigraphy-measured TST was found for an intervention comprising the provision of written information compared with no intervention (MD 12.2 minutes, 95% CI -25.1 to 49.5 minutes). A similar finding was reported by the RCT that compared the modes of delivering a sleep management training curriculum to parents (i.e. face to face vs. group) [MD -7.2 minutes (favours group intervention), 95% CI minutes].128The authors alsoRESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk62report the findings of a post hoc analysis, pre and post intervention, for the two groups combined, which are not described in this report. The before-and-after study129narratively reports that there were no 'significant changes 'in TST following a group intervention. Sleep efficiency Two RCTs ( n=116)127,128reported actigraphy-measured sleep efficiency (the percentage of time spent in bed asleep) informed or verified by sleep diaries. The authors of the RCT127that evaluated the provision of sleep management training via written material, compared with no intervention, report a statistically significant difference in the mean change (baseline to treatment) for the two groups ( p=0.04); however, we were able to calculate the unadjusted difference between the two groups only post intervention and this difference was not statistically significant (MD 2.7%, 95% CI 2.0% to 7.4%). Similarly, no significant difference in this outcome was reported by the RCT128that compared face-to-face delivery with group delivery of an intervention (MD -1.1%, 95% CI -3.6% to 1.4%). The authors also report the findings of a post hoc analysis for sleep efficiency, pre and post intervention, for the two groups combined, which are not described in this report. The Children 's Sleep Habits Questionnaire One RCT ( n=80)128and four before-and-after studies ( n=126)129,151,162,163reported score. The CSHQ is a validated parent-reported assessment of child sleep.133Higher scores on the CSHQ indicate a greater severity of the sleeping disturbance resulting from either the frequency or number of different behaviours presenting. The RCT reported the CSHQ results only for all participants in the two treatment groups (combining participants receiving group and individual education) and not for each group separately. For the RCT,128there was no statistically significant difference in total CSHQ score post intervention between the group receiving face-to-face delivery and the group delivery arm ( Table 13 ). In a post hoc analysis, the authors report merging the two arms and report combined before-and-after outcomes, which are not described here. Two before-and-after studies, one evaluating a three-session group-delivered intervention129 TABLE 13 Outcome results for CSHQ of parent-directed non-tailored interventions StudyTime point, mean Cannot be estimated.a Effect size given as 0.20 Beresford et al.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.63and the other evaluating a four-session group-delivered intervention with implementation support,151report a statistically significant improvement (i.e. a decrease) in CSHQ total score post intervention compared with pre intervention. For two additional before-and-after studies,162,163it was not possible to estimate the MD in total CSHQ score between pre and post intervention, as they were not matched samples; however, the studies report small or very small effect sizes. Parent-set child sleep goals Two before-and-after studies ( n=47) -one a single-session group-delivered a group-delivered intervention over four sessions162-reported parent-set child sleep goals using a goal attainment rating scale. This was a 10-point rating scale used to indicate the extent to which a goal has been achieved, from 1 =very far from this goal to 10 =I have achieved my goal. Both studies reported that, post intervention, the mean goal attainment rating had 'significantly improved ' compared with the pre-intervention rating. It was not possible to estimate the MD between the scores at pre and post intervention, as neither study reported data for a matched sample. These same before-and-after studies162,163also reported the proportion of children that had improved, deteriorated or not changed in the goal attainment rating (improvement/deterioration based on whether or not the goal scores have moved 1 point in a positive or negative direction). Both studies reported that, post intervention, the majority of parents reported an improvement in goal attainment rating compared with pre intervention. In one study,16293% of participants had improved and there was no change in the other 7% and, in the other study,16365% improved, 19% had no change and 16% had deteriorated.163 Family Inventory of Sleep Habits One RCT ( n=80)128and two before-and-after studies ( n=79)129,151evaluated child sleep outcomes using the Family Inventory of Sleep Habits (FISH). FISH is a validated parent-completed scale to assess sleep hygiene in children with ASD170and a higher score indicates better sleep hygiene. The RCT128reported the results of a post hoc analysis for all participants in the two treatment groups (group and individual education) combined and not for each group separately; therefore, these data are not reported here. One of the before-and-after studies129also did not report data for the total score (only for each item separately) and, therefore, they are not reported here. The other before-and-after study151 of a group-delivered sleep management intervention reported statistically significant improvements (data reported only at week 11) in total FISH score post intervention compared with pre intervention (MD 1.38, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.71). Composite sleep disturbance score One RCT ( n=66)49reported a composite sleep disturbance score. The composite sleep disturbance score was calculated from parent-completed diaries to identify sleep problems, covering settling frequency, settling duration, night waking frequency and night waking duration. A higher score on the composite sleep disturbance score indicates more severe sleep problems. This study compared no intervention with either the intervention delivered in written format or via a face-to-face session and it reported that there was no statistically significant difference between these delivery methods post intervention (MD 0.15, 95% CI -1.38 to 1.68). The trial also included a third, 'control ', arm that received no treatment for the first 6 weeks after randomisation, following which participants were re-randomised to receive either the conventional treatment or the booklet treatment. The authors compared the two active arms (written format and face to face) with the control and found statistically significant differences between the written format group and the control group (MD 3.20, 95% CI 1.89 to 4.51), and between the face-to-face format and the control group (MD 3.35, 95% CI 2.32 to 4.38).49RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk64Severity of sleep problems One before-and-after study, evaluating an individually delivered parent-directed tailored intervention, used a visual analogue scale to capture parent-reported 'severity of sleep problems ', ranging in score from 0=no problem to 10 =very severe problem.149The author reported a statistically significant improvement for the group post intervention compared with pre intervention but does not present sufficient data to allow for a MD and 95% CI to be calculated. Sleep initiation Sleep onset latency Two RCTs ( n=116)127,128and two before-and-after studies ( n=40)129,149listed SOL (the time from bedtime to sleep onset time) as an outcome. Bramble149described SOL as 'mean time to settle ', whereas the other studies described SOL as the time from bedtime to sleep onset time. In the RCT evaluating the provision of written information, no evidence of a statistically significant difference in SOL was found between this intervention and no intervention ( Table 14 ).127Similarly, the authors of the second RCT128comparing modes of delivery (individual vs. group) reported that they found no evidence of a statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of this outcome. The authors also report the findings of a post hoc analysis for SOL, pre and post intervention, for the two groups combined, which are not described in this report. One before-and-after study129only narratively reports that there were no 'significant changes 'in SOL following a group intervention. The other before-and-after study149that evaluated 'mean time to settle ' reported a statistically significant reduction in mean time to settle following a face-to-face session. Sleep maintenance Wake after sleep onset The outcome measure was WASO (night waking duration and/or frequency after the child falls asleep) in two RCTs ( n=116)127,128and one before-and-after study.129 TABLE 14 Outcome results for SOL of parent-directed non-tailored interventions Study OutcomeTime point, mean (SD) MD (95% CI) Baseline Follow-up RCTs Adkins et NR NR to -24.6) NR, not reported.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.65The RCT127comparing an intervention (provision of written material) with no intervention found that there was no evidence of a statistically significant difference at follow-up between the two groups (MD 0.5, 95% CI -18.9 to 19.9). The RCT128comparing individual and group delivery of an intervention also reported that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups on this outcome measure (MD -0.2, 95% CI -9.9 to 9.5). When the two treatment groups were combined, the mean change from pre to post intervention was -3.5 minutes (95% CI -7.3 to 0.3 minutes). The before-and-after study only narratively reports that there were no 'significant changes 'in WASO following a group intervention.129 Child behaviour Child behaviour was evaluated using four different outcome measures: (1) the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), (2) the Repetitive Behaviour Scale -Revised (RBS-R), (3) the Parental Concerns Questionnaire (PCQ) and (4) the BPI. The Child Behavior study ( investigate changes in daytime behaviour problems.171The CBCL is a validated parent-completed outcome measure for identifying problem behaviour in children, which is comprised of eight subscales. A higher score indicates more severe problems. Although the before-and-after study reported a total CBCL score, the RCT reported the following subscales of the CBCL only: anxious/depressed, attention, ADHD and withdrawn. The RCT comparing individual with group delivery of an intervention reported that there was no difference between the two arms at follow-up, although data were not presented separately for the two groups.128 With the two groups combined, the mean change from baseline to post intervention was as follows: anxious/depressed -2.2 (95% CI -4.8 to -0.8). The before-and-after study evaluated a group-delivered intervention (with implementation support offered via telephone) and did not find evidence of a statistically significant improvement in total CBCL scores post intervention (week 7) (MD -0.91, 95% CI -2.48 to 0.66).151 The n=80)128and one before-and-after using the RBS-R (total).172A lower RBS-R score indicates fewer problems. The authors of the RCT, comparing group and individual delivery, reported that they found no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the change from baseline in daytime behaviours between the two groups post intervention (data not provided). The authors also report the findings of a post hoc analysis for RBS-R, pre and post intervention, for the two groups combined, which are not described in this report.128 In the before-and-after study129that evaluated a group-delivered intervention, a statistically significant improvement (i.e. decrease) was observed post intervention compared with pre intervention (MD -1.22, 95% CI -2.06 to -0.38). The Parental Concerns Questionnaire Two before-and-after studies ( n=79)129,151evaluated child daytime behaviour using the PCQ.173The PCQ is designed as a parent interview screening instrument assessing the severity of developmental and associated psychiatric symptomatology using a four-point scale. A higher PCQ score indicates more severe problems. Both of the before-and-after studies129,151evaluated group-delivered interventions, one of which included implementation support.151A total score could not be derived for one study,129as the authors did not report this (data reported for each subscale of the PCQ separately). The other study151found no evidence of a statistically significant change in the PCQ scores post intervention (data reported for week 11 only) compared with pre intervention (MD -1.38, 95% CI -2.82 to 0.06).RESULTS NIHR Journals Problem Index One before-and-after study ( n=15)149evaluated child daytime behaviour using the BPI.167The BPI is a validated parent-reported outcome measure of child behaviour. Higher scores indicate a greater level of behaviour problems. The authors reported the BPI at 4 months 'follow-up only and reported a statistically significant improvement for the group post intervention, with a score of 22.1 (SD 12.4), compared with a pre-intervention score of 32.6 (SD 13.6) (MD -10.5, 95% CI 3.3 to 17.7).149 Child 's health-related quality of life One RCT ( n=80)128measured health-related quality of life using the PedsQL.174The is a validated parent-completed questionnaire that assesses parents 'perception of quality of life in paediatric patients with chronic health conditions. Higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life. The authors of the RCT,128comparing group delivery with individual delivery of a sleep management intervention, reported that they found no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the change from baseline in PedsQL score between the two groups post intervention (data not provided). The authors also report the findings of a post hoc analysis for PedsQL, both pre and post intervention, for the two groups combined, which are not described in this report. Parent outcomes Several studies assessed parent outcomes. The outcome domains assessed were mental well-being,129,149,151 quality of sleep149,151and parents 'sense of competence.128,162,163 Quality of sleep A before-and-after study ( n=15)149of an individually delivered intervention with implementation support measured self-reported quality of sleep using the Maternal Sleep Scale.175The Maternal Sleep Scale is a validated self-completed questionnaire that measures mothers 'sleep quality, with higher scores indicating better sleep quality. The authors reported the Maternal Sleep Scale scores at the end of the treatment phase and reported a statistically significant improvement for the group post intervention, with a mean score of 7.1 (SD 2.3), compared with a pre-intervention mean score of 4.1 (SD 2.3) (MD 3, 95% CI 1.7 to 4.3).149 A second before-and-after study ( n=54)151of a group-delivered intervention with implementation support used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to measure parents 'self-reported quality of sleep. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a validated self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality.176Lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality. No statistically significant change on this measure was reported following the intervention (week 7) (MD -0.51, 95% CI -1.37 studies ( parental stress using the Parenting Stress Index -Short Form.177The Parenting Stress Index -Short Form is a validated self-completed outcome measure used for measuring parenting stress. A higher score indicates higher levels of parental stress. Both studies evaluated group-delivered interventions, one with implementation support151and one without.129Neither reported a statistically significant change on the Parenting Stress Index -Short Form in post-intervention compared with pre-intervention scores ( Table 15 ).

A higher score indicates a higher parenting sense of competence. This scale comprises two subscales: sense of efficacy and parenting satisfaction. The authors of the RCT,128comparing group and individual delivery, reported that they found no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the change from baseline in PSOC between the two groups post intervention (data not presented). The authors also reported the findings of a post hoc analysis for parenting sense of competence, both pre and post intervention, for the two groups combined, which are not described in this report. One before-and-after study162reported a statistically significant improvement in the PSOC-efficacy (effect size 0.82), but not PSOC-satisfaction (effect size 0.38), from pre to post intervention, following a four-session group intervention; however, a MD and 95% CI could not be calculated, as data were not reported for a matched sample. The second before-and-after study163reported very little change in scores on PSOC-efficacy and PSOC-satisfaction 12 weeks after attending a single-session workshop (effect sizes -0.15 and 0.11, respectively); however, a MD and 95% CI could not be calculated as data were not reported for a matched sample. Summary Eight studies49,127 -129,149,151,162,163evaluated parent-directed non-tailored interventions to manage sleep disturbance in children with NDs. We defined non-tailored interventions as those comprising the delivery of a standard 'training curriculum '. All the non-tailored interventions were comprehensive in their content, covering material on sleep and sleep processes, sleep hygiene and the management of specific problem behaviours (e.g. night wakings). Within this set of interventions, the design of the curriculum may include opportunities for parents to be supported to operationalise the material learnt for their child 's sleep disturbance. Some implementation support (i.e. support to parents as they implement new ways of managing their child 's sleep disturbance) may also be included. Compared with the tailored interventions reported in the previous section, the non-tailored interventions evaluated by studies included in this review were much more diverse in terms of mode of delivery [i.e. writte n material, group delivery (single vs. multiple sessions) and one-to-one work]. In addition, they diff ered in terms of the extent to which they could accommodate the specific information and training needs parents ma y have in terms of their own child 's condition and/or sleep problem. Furthermore, some included implementation support, but others did not. When implementation support was provided, it was always via telephone call s. The eight studies included one RCT127that compared intervention (written material) and no intervention and five before-and-after studies.129,149,151,162,163Three129,151,162evaluated a group-delivered intervention comprising three or four sessions, one163evaluated a single-session workshop and one evaluated anTABLE 15 Outcome results for parent/carer mental well-being of parent-directed non-tailored interventions Study OutcomeTime point, mean (SD) MD (95% CI) Baseline Follow-up Reed et al. NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk68individually delivered intervention.149One RCT49compared two modes of delivering the same training curriculum (written material vs. face-to-face session) with no intervention. The final RCT128compared delivery of the same training curriculum via group and individual delivery. All the studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. Four interventions127 -129,151were developed specifically for children with ASDs, and only children with these conditions were recruited to the studies. In the remaining four studies,49,149,162,163the interventions were evaluated using samples of children with a range of NDs. The mean age of children recruited to the studies ranged from 2.0 to 8.9 years. The majority of studies reported that the children had problems with both sleep initiation and sleep maintenance. The conclusions that can be drawn are limited, owing to the rating of the high risk of bias, the use of post-intervention follow-up time points and the risk of studies being underpowered to detect an effect. In addition, a large number of different outcome measures were used and these evaluated a range of outcome domains. We organise the findings in terms of mode of delivery and, when relevant, availability of implementation support. A single trial evaluated the impact of an intervention comprising the provision of written information (and no implementation support) with no intervention.127There was no evidence of benefit at 2 weeks post intervention, as measured using actigraphy-collected sleep outcomes data (TST, Sleep Efficiency, SOL and WASO). Another three-armed trial49compared the provision of written information or the delivery of the same material via a single face-to-face session with a waiting list control group. Neither active arm included the provision of implementation support. Evidence of benefit at 6 weeks post intervention, based on a parent-report measure (composite sleep disturbance score), was reported for both modes of intervention delivery compared with the control group (written information vs. control, MD 3.20, 95% CI 1.89 to 4.51; face-to-face delivery vs. control, MD 3.35, 95% CI 2.32 to 4.38). The study was not powered to detect a difference between the two active arms. No other child outcomes, or parent outcomes, were assessed by these studies. There is, therefore, mixed and very limited evidence regarding the impact that the provision of written information with no implementation support has on child sleep outcomes only. Given the differences in outcome measures, differences in post-intervention follow-up time points and the high risk of bias for both studies, it is not possible to draw further conclusions regarding this sort of intervention. Furthermore, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the relative benefits of written versus face-to-face delivery of training on sleep management. One before-and-after study149evaluated an intervention comprising a single face-to-face training session and implementation support available for up to 2 weeks after the session. The authors report significant improvements post intervention on non-standardised sleep outcome measures and a standardised measure of child behaviour (BPI) but data were not fully presented. Given the study limitations, no conclusions can be drawn from this evidence. Two before-and-after studies evaluated multisession ( n=3 or 4) group-delivered interventions for which no implementation support was available after the group sessions were completed.129,162In one study, outcomes were reassessed immediately post intervention;129in the other study, this took place 1 month post intervention.162Both studies report improvements in child sleep outcomes measured using the same standardised parent-report measure (CSHQ) (for Beresford et al. ,162the pre- and post-intervention samples were not matched and the reported effect size was 0.2; for Reed et al. ,129the MD was -6.89, with a 95% CI of -2.58 to -11.2) and, for one study (Beresford et al.162), using achievement of parent-set sleep goals (progress towards goals, 93% of participants; no progress, 7% of participants). However, one of the studies129also used actigraphy to collect sleep outcomes data (TST, SOL, WASO). No benefits were reported on these outcomes. Reed et al.129also reported evidence of benefit in terms of parent-reported child behaviour (RBS-R). A further before-and-after study151also evaluated a multisession ( n=3) group- delivered intervention but also offered implementation support after the group sessions had finished via weekly telephone calls (duration unclear). This study also used the CSHQ to measure child sleep outcomesDOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

Child behaviour outcomes were also assessed (CBCL and PCQ) and no benefits were reported. Beresford et al.162also report significant improvements in self-reported parental efficacy but not parenting satisfaction (PSOC scale); however, pre- and post-intervention samples were not matched so a MD and CI could not be calculated. Reed et al.129and Yu and Hong161investigated parenting stress using the Parenting Stressing Index; neither study reported a change in this outcome between pre- and post-intervention time points. Yu and Hong161also report no effect on parent-reported sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). Taken together, there is some limited evidence of benefit for group-delivered interventions in terms of parent-reported child sleep outcomes. We would again, however, note that these studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. It is not possible to draw further conclusions with respect to other child, or parent, outcomes. A RCT128compared delivery of the same training curriculum via a multisession ( n=2) group-delivered intervention and a single intervention; both arms included the same level of implementation support. No differences in outcomes (1 month post intervention) between the two modes of delivery were reported on actigraphy-derived sleep outcomes (TST, Sleep Efficiency, SOL and WASO) or parent-reported measures of child sleep (CSHQ and FISH), behaviour (CBCL and RBS-R) or quality of life (PedsQL). As this is a single study that was rated as having a high risk of bias, and it is not clear if it was adequately powered, no conclusions can be drawn. The final mode of intervention delivery evaluated was a single workshop (5 hours) delivered to groups of up to 20 parents.163No implementation support was available. Parent-reported sleep outcome measures (CSHQ and attainment of parent-identified sleep goals) were readministered 3 months after the workshop. Benefits on these indicators were reported by the authors (PSOC-efficacy, effect size 0.82; PSOC-satisfaction, effect size 0.38). However, MD and CIs could not be calculated, as the data were not reported for a matched sample. Given that this mode of intervention delivery was evaluated by only a single study that was rated as having a high risk of bias, no further conclusions can be drawn. Non-comprehensive parent-directed interventions Two studies evaluated parent-directed sleep management interventions, which we classified as being non-comprehensive in their content, that is, the content of the training was focused on just one topic area related to sleep disturbance (whereas interventions that were classified as comprehensive addressed sleep and sleep processes, sleep hygiene and the management of specific problem behaviours, such as night waking). One intervention, evaluated using a cluster RCT152with an attention control arm, comprised a tailored intervention that was restricted to training parents on behavioural principles of managing problem sleep behaviours, including functional analysis and behaviour management strategies. A single session with a practitioner, delivered in families 'homes, was followed by telephone calls on at least a weekly basis to support the implementation of sleep management strategies. The total duration of implementation support was variable, continuing up to 3 months after the session with the practitioner. A description of the 'attention control 'intervention was not provided. Although this appears to be a cluster trial, the description of the recruitment and randomisation processes is unclear and, so, for the purposes of this analysis, we have treated it as if it were an individually randomised trial. There were insufficient data to allow for any potential clustering and, in any case, the nature of the clustering was unclear. A before-and-after study155evaluated the second non-comprehensive intervention. This intervention was restricted to training parents on principles of sleep hygiene only and was a single session delivered in a clinic. No implementation support was provided.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk70The mean age of participants in the RCT152was 9.49 years and the children had a mixed range of NDs. Neither the children 's ages nor their NDs were reported by the before-and-after study.155Neither study reported whether or not the child/parent had received any prior interventions. A total of 37 sleep-related outcomes were measured in the RCT152(see Appendices 15 -17). Follow-ups were conducted post intervention at 'visit 4 '(approximately 1 month post randomisation) and 'visit 6 ' (approximately 3 months post randomisation). Here, when data are available for both time points, we report data from visit 4 as, for the majority of the sample, contact with a sleep practitioner had ceased by this point.152A total of four sleep-related outcomes were measured in the before-and-after study155 (see Appendices 15 and17). Follow-ups were conducted after 6 weeks, at the end of the intervention. Table 16 provides an overview of the studies evaluating the non-comprehensive parent-directed interventions. Child sleep-related outcomes Global measures and composite scores Both the RCT153(n=30) and the before-and-after study155(n=23) reported global sleep outcomes and composite scores, although they used different measures ( Table 17 ). The RCT152of the intervention restricted to training on behaviour modification principles found a statistically significant difference in Composite Sleep Index-measured child sleep compared with no intervention at 'visit 4 '. There was no statistically significant difference in actigraphy-measured TST for children in the intervention and control groups at visit 4. The before-and-after study,155evaluating the intervention providing training in sleep hygiene, reported a statistically significant improvement in CSHQ total score at 6 weeks post intervention. Sleep maintenance The RCT152(n=30) of the intervention restricted to training on principles of behaviour modification reported a variety of actigraphy-measured sleep maintenance outcomes.

Parent outcomes The RCT152(n=30) comparing the intervention restricted to training on behaviour modification principles with an attentional control reported on a range of parent outcomes, including: lmaternal TST (actigraphy) their own sleep (six-point Likert scale) lpaternal satisfaction with their own sleep (six-point Likert scale) lmaternal stress (Malaise Inventory) lpaternal stress (Malaise Inventory) lmaternal perceived ability to control difficult sleep-related behaviour of their child (visual analogue scale) lpaternal perceived ability to control difficult sleep-related behaviour of their child (visual analogue scale) lmaternal perceptions of their partner 's ability to control difficult sleep-related behaviour of their child (visual analogue scale) lpaternal perceptions of their partner 's ability to control difficulty sleep-related behaviour of their child (visual analogue scale). Further details of how these outcomes were measured are provided in Appendix 22 . The data are summarised in Table 20 .

The RCT152reported on parents 'orientation to internal or external control beliefs as measured using the internality/externality control scale. These data are summarised in Table 21 and details of how these outcomes were measured are provided in Appendix 23 . There were significant between-group differences for the father measures. The before-and-after study155measured perceived confidence and efficacy using a parent satisfaction Likert-type scale. The authors narratively report that 87% of the responses were positive; however, it is unclear whether or not these positive responses related to child 's sleep and/or the intervention. Summary Two studies evaluated tailored interventions that were non-comprehensive in terms of their content. Thus, although comprehensive parent-directed interventions (tailored and non-tailored) covered material on sleep and sleep processes, sleep hygiene and the management of specific problem behaviours (e.g. night wakings), non-comprehensive interventions focused on just one of these aspects. Both non-comprehensive interventions were, however, tailored interventions, that is, the intervention was personalised to the specific child and family context. A RCT152evaluated a parent-directed intervention in which the content was restricted to behavioural principles of managing problem sleep behaviour. This intervention was delivered via a single face-to-face session followed by implementation support at least weekly for up to 3 months (duration as required). The comparator group was an attention control in which parents attended a single session with a practitioner (same duration as active arm, session content not described). We treated follow-up data collected 1 month after the face-to-face session as post-intervention outcomes. The sample included a range of NDs and the mean age of the children was 8.21 years. The rating of risk of bias was high. Post intervention, an actigraphy-derived measure of sleep outcome (TST) was no different between the intervention and control arms, with similar findings for other actigraphy-derived measures (fragmentation index, movement during sleep and movement index). However, significant differences in scores postTABLE 20 Other parent outcomes for other parent-directed non-pharmacological interventions (Wiggs and Stores152) (continued ) OutcomeTime period, mean (SD) MD (95% CI) Baseline Follow-up Perceived ability to control difficult sleep-related behaviour of Perception of partner 's ability to control difficult sleep-related behaviour of their child (mother)Intervention group: 5.61 0.40)a Perceived ability sleep-related behaviour of own child (father)Intervention group: 5.42 Perception of partner 's ability to control difficult sleep-related behaviour of their child (father)Intervention a The estimated unadjusted difference at follow-up between the intervention and control groups.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk76intervention on a parent-reported child sleep measure (Composite Sleep Index), favouring the intervention group, were found (MD -2.83, 95% CI -4.24 to -1.42). In addition, post intervention, fathers '(but not mothers ') ratings of satisfaction with the child 's sleep (non-standardised measure) were higher for the intervention group than for the control group (MD -1.37, 95% CI -2.37 to 0.37). The study also assessed child behaviour (parent and teacher report) using five subscales (inappropriate speech, hyperactivity, stereotypies, lethargy and irritability) of the ABC. Post intervention, no significant differences between the intervention and control arms were found on any subscale scores except parent-reported stereotypies. Here, a benefit to the intervention group was reported (MD -3.6, 95% CI -5.95 to 1.25). In terms of mothers 'and fathers 'outcomes, sleep outcomes [actigraphy-derived (mothers sleep; Sleepiness Scale, non-standardised measure of satisfaction with sleep] and other outcomes (psychological distress (Malaise Inventory), non-standardised measures of perceptions of own and partner 's ability to control child 's difficult sleep-related behaviour) were monitored. No differences between intervention and control arms were found post intervention for any of these outcomes. Overall, given that there is just one trial -and it has a high risk of bias -no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of parent-directed sleep management interventions in which the content was restricted to behavioural principles of managing problem sleep behaviour.TABLE 21 Measures of perceived confidence and/or efficacy and/or understanding of sleep/sleep management: non-comprehensive parent-directed interventions Study OutcomeTime CI) Baseline Follow-up NR 87% of the responses were positive NR, not reported. a The estimated unadjusted difference at follow-up between the intervention and control groups.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

The intervention, specific to children with ADHD, was delivered via a single session between parent and practitioner. No implementation support was offered. The ages of children recruited to the study were not reported. Risk of bias was high. Follow-up was 6 weeks post intervention. Post intervention, scores on the parent-reported CSHQ had improved (MD 6.4, 95% CI 4.3 to 8.5). A measure of ADHD symptom severity was also used (Vanderbilt Assessment Scale), and improvements were also reported on this measure post intervention (Vanderbilt Assessment Scale questions 1 -9, MD -3.87, 95% CI -7.37 to 0.37; Vanderbilt Assessment Scale questions 10 -18, MD -2.91, 95% CI -4.81 to 1.01). (Changes in scores on a non-standardised measure of parent satisfaction were also reported, although it is unclear if this is capturing satisfaction with the child 's sleep and/or the intervention per se). In terms of this intervention, given that the evidence is limited to a before-and-after study with a high risk of bias, no conclusions regarding its impact on children 's sleep or ADHD symptoms can be drawn. Other non-pharmacological interventions Seven studies36,156 -161evaluated other types of non-pharmacological interventions (see Table 9 and Appendix 18 ). One crossover RCT compared valerian (dried and Valeriana edulis plant) with placebo;156one crossover RCT compared weighted blankets with placebo blankets;36one parallel RCT compared faded bedtime with response costs and bedtime scheduling;157three uncontrolled before-and- after studies evaluated light therapy and a behavioural programme,158an aquatic exercise programme159 and acupuncture and ear-point taping;161and one controlled before-and-after study compared essential fatty acid supplements with placebo.160 The total intervention duration ranged from 12 days to 36 weeks36,156,160,161and was not specified in two studies.158,159 Three studies included children with a mixed range of NDs.36,156,157Two included children with learning disabilities,158,161one included children with a diagnosis of ASD159and one included children with a diagnosis of ADHD.160 The age of participants varied, with a mean age range of 6.7 -10.8 years for the RCTs36,156,157and a mean age range of 2.9 -8.8 years for the uncontrolled before-and-after studies.158,159,161The controlled before- and-after study reported the participants 'ages as between 9 and 12 years.160All RCTs included children with sleep initiation and sleep maintenance disturbances.36,156,157The before-and-after studies included children with a mix of sleep disturbances (see Table 9 ) relating to sleep maintenance and 'lack of sleep consolidation ',158sleep dysfunction,159'sleep deprived '160and sleep initiation, maintenance and abnormal sleep state.161 There was limited reporting of prior interventions. One parallel RCT reported that children were excluded if they were receiving pharmacological interventions for sleep.157One before-and-after study reported that over half of the study sample had attended sleep clinics and centres for treatment, with some children receiving behavioural treatments.158 A total of 17 child sleep-related outcomes were measured by the RCTs (see Appendix 18 ). Commonly measured child sleep-related outcomes included SOL,36,156,157night waking,36,156,157TST,36,156sleep quality36,156and child daytime behaviour and cognition.36,156A total of 10 child sleep-related outcomes were measured by the before-and-after studies (see Appendix 18 ) and these were mainly measured byRESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk78single studies. The majority of outcomes reported by before-and-after studies were measured by single studies. However, TST was measured by two studies.158,159 In all studies, follow-up was conducted immediately following the completion of the intervention, and this varied between studies. For the RCTs, the follow-up times were at 2 weeks,156at 4 weeks36and after the last 10 days of an 'on average 8-week 'treatment.157For the before-and-after studies, the follow-up times were at 10 weeks160and at 6 months.158For one before-and-after study, the length of the follow-up was unclear and it was reported as 'after treatment '.161The final study, Oriel et al. ,159adopted an A -B-A withdrawal design, in which A was a control phase and B was a treatment phase. Outcomes were reported at 4 (A1), 8 (B) and 12 (A2) weeks from the start of the intervention.159We report all outcomes for Oriel et al.159at 8 weeks, which was when the intervention ceased.

Results show that there was no statistically significant difference in TST between valerian and placebo groups.156There was no statistically significant difference in actigraphy- or sleep diary-reported TST for weighted blankets compared with control blankets.36There was a statistically significant increase in TST between periods A1 and B following an aquatic exercise intervention159and from pre to post intervention following light therapy and a behavioural programme.158 Other global measures and composite scores One RCT36(n=73) and two before-and-after studies161(n=38) reported further global measures and composite scores ( Table 23 ). There was a statistically significant difference in Composite Sleep Disturbance Index score (but not sleep efficiency) with weighted blankets compared with placebo blanket.36 Two before-and-after studies159,161measured CSHQ total score (validated parent-reported assessment of child sleep, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of the sleeping disturbance),159,161although one reported this only for baseline.159A statistically significant reduction in total CSHQ score was reported following acupuncture and ear-point taping post intervention.161 Sleep initiation Bedtime settling Two RCTs36,156(n=78) and one before-and-after study159(n=8) reported SOL ( Table 24 ). One RCT reported SOL using a sleep diary only156and one used a parental diary and actigraphy.36The before-and-after study measured SOL via telephone calls from parents to researchers.159 There was no statistically significant difference in SOL with valerian treatment compared with placebo156 or following an aquatic exercise intervention.159There was no statistically significant difference in actigraphy- or parent-reported SOL for the RCT of weighted blankets.36 One RCT narratively reported exactly what time the child fell asleep at night.157Among the eight participants who had issues with sleep initiation at baseline, trained observers reported that three out of the four participants who received the faded bedtime and response costs intervention experienced improved sleep initiation during the last 10 days of treatment, with one participant continuing to have issues falling asleep.

These show that there was no statistically significant reduction in time awake during the night (night waking) following valerian treatment.156There was no statistically significant difference in number of night wakings following an aquatic exercise programme,159although the baseline number of wakings was very low, or for weighted blankets compared with placebo blankets.36 Piazza et al.157narratively reported that all five participants who received the faded bedtime and response costs intervention saw improvements to night wakings. Following bedtime scheduling of the six control participants who had issues with night wakings at baseline, two participants improved, two saw little difference and one had worsened night wakings.157 Other sleep maintenance outcomes Two RCTs36,157(n=87) and one before-and-after study158(n=14) reported other outcomes related to sleep maintenance ( Table 26 ). The before-and-after study evaluating light therapy and a behavioural programme reported sleep diary-measured 'longest wake and sleep periods during a 24-hour cycle '. Data for this outcome were reported only graphically and it was not possible to estimate results from the graph.158 One RCT narratively reported that all six of the participants who received the faded bedtime and response costs intervention and had problems with early waking at baseline had improved on this outcome duringTABLE 24 Outcome results for sleep initiation of other non-pharmacological interventions Study OutcomeTime point, mean (SD) MD (95% CI) (minutes) to 6.57)a a Estimated unadjusted difference between intervention and control group at follow-up for RCTs and change from pre to post intervention for before-and-after studies.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

In the control group, two out of the six participants reported improvements in early wakings, one worsened and three saw little or no change following bedtime scheduling.157 There was no difference between the treatment groups at follow-up in Gringas et al.36in terms of time awake after sleep onset and the proportion of nights with one or more awakening. Sleep quality Two RCTs36,156(n=78) and one before-and-after study160(n=78) reported quality of sleep ( Table 27 ). There was a statistically significant improvement in sleep diary-measured sleep quality from baseline for children who received both valerian treatment and placebo; however, the difference in this outcome at follow-up between the groups was not statistically significant.156There was also improvement in sleep quality for children who received fatty acids and placebo, as measured on a 'short questionnaire '.160TABLE 26 Other sleep maintenance outcomes for other non-pharmacological interventions Study OutcomeTime point, mean (SD) MD (95% CI) Baseline Follow-up RCTs Gringras et al. nights with 1 wakingCombined: 0.3 (0.3) Intervention group: 0.2 (0.3) Control group: 0.2 (0.3)-0.01 ( -0.06 Piazza Control (SD (SD NR) Control group: 1.10 (SD NR)0.57b NR, not reported. a Estimated unadjusted difference between intervention and control group at follow-up. b Data too limited to calculate 95% CI.TABLE 25 Outcome results for night waking of other non-pharmacological interventions Study OutcomeTime point, mean (SD) MD (95% CI) Baseline Follow-up RCTs Francis and Dempster (2002)156Nocturnal time (minutes)Combined: of wakingsCombined: 20.9 (8.0) group: 19.5 ( -1.45 to 0.21)a a Estimated unadjusted difference between the intervention and control groups at follow-up for RCTs and change from pre to post intervention for before-and-after studies.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk82Gringras et al.36measured children 's perceptions of sleep quality using a smiley face rating scale.

Data for this outcome were reported graphically, with no narrative discussion from the authors, and could not be extracted. Child-related quality of life, daytime behaviour and cognition Two RCTs36,156(n=78) reported on child daytime behaviour using a sleep diary156and the ABC.36 There was no statistically significant difference in daytime behaviour and cognition for total ABC score or subscale scores between the weighted blanket group and the control blanket group at 4 weeks from baseline (MD -2.3, 95% CI -5.4 to 0.8).36Francis and Dempster156used the sleep diary data to narratively describe anecdotal changes in child behaviour, but quantitative data were not reported. Other outcomes One RCT ( n=73) and one controlled before-and-after study ( n=78) reported other outcomes of interest.36,160The RCT reported that there were no significant differences for the total Sensory Behaviour Questionnaire or its subscales between the weighted blanket group and the control blanket group.36The controlled before-and-after study that compared essential fatty acid supplements with placebo reported a variety of other child-related outcomes at the end of the 10-week intervention period.160These data are summarised in Table 28 . Adverse events Two out of the seven studies reported adverse events ( Table 29 ).36,160One study36reported how adverse events were measured, namely through parents reporting to a 24-hour telephone number and weekly face-to-face or telephone-based reviews with parents.

These interventions were all different from each other. Therefore, we summarise the findings from each study in turn. Weighted blankets were evaluated using a crossover RCT, with a non-weighted blanket as the control intervention.36The intervention was developed for children with ASD, and all children recruited to the study had this diagnosis. They were aged between 5 and 16 years. The trial was rated as having a high risk of bias. Outcomes were measured over each 2-week treatment period. Data on 27 children in each arm were analysed. No benefits in terms of TST and SOL (derived from actigraphy) or a number of other sleep outcomes derived from parent-completed sleep diaries (number of wakings/night, proportion of nights with more than one waking and total time awake after sleep onset) were reported for children in the weighted blanket group compared with the non-weighted blanket group. Similarly, no benefits from a weighted blanket were reported in terms of child behaviour (ABC) or increased sensitivities to sensory stimulation (Sensory Behaviour Questionnaire). There were no serious adverse events. Valerian, a herb prepared in tablet form, was evaluated with a placebo using a RCT156in a sample of five children with a range of NDs aged 7 -14 years who had difficulties with sleep initiation and/or sleep maintenance. The rating of risk of bias was high. At 2 weeks post intervention, there was no difference between arms in terms of TST, SOL and duration of time awake during the night. Parents 'perceptions of sleep quality (measured using a non-standardised visual analogue scale) did not differ significantly between trial arms post intervention. No other quantitative data on child outcomes were reported. Adverse events were not reported. Essential fatty acid supplement preparation in tablet form was evaluated using a controlled before-and-after study.160All children (active arm, n=40; placebo, n=38), aged 9 -12 years, recruited to the study were diagnosed with ADHD and were described as 'sleep deprived '. The study was rated as having a high risk of bias.TABLE 29 Adverse events in studies evaluating other non-pharmacological interventions Study Adverse events reported Measures used Francis and Demspter (2002)156NR Gringras et al.

A number of other parent-reported child outcomes were evaluated using non-standardised, parent-reported indicators (degree of fatigue in general during the day, level of good mood in general, level of ability to concentrate during the day and percentage of homework completed in general). No significant difference between active and placebo arms was found for these outcomes. Transient gastric problems were reported for some children in the active group. An aquatic exercise programme for children with ASD (mean age 8.8 years) and 'sleep dysfunction 'was evaluated using a before-and-after study design.159Eight children were recruited to the study. The study was rated as having a high risk of bias. The outcomes at 8 weeks post intervention were reviewed. Biweekly telephone interviews with parents were used to collect data, from which TST and SOL were calculated. Increased TST post intervention was reported (MD 83.3 minutes, 95% CI 17.55 to 149.09 minutes). No other changes to child sleep outcomes were reported. Adverse events were not reported. Acupuncture and ear-point taping were also evaluated using a controlled before-and-after study design.161 Thirty children (mean age 6.9 years) with sleep initiation or maintenance difficulties and/or an 'abnormal sleep state 'were recruited to the study. All were described as having learning disabilities. It was not clear when post-intervention outcomes data were collected. The study was rated as having a high risk of bias. At post intervention, a significant improvement in scores on a parent-reported sleep outcome measure (CSHQ) was reported (MD -11.50, 95% CI -13.33 to -9.67). A light therapy intervention combined with a programme of daytime schedules and activities was evaluated using a before-and-after study.158Fourteen children, aged 9 months to 4 years, were recruited to the study. They were described as having learning disabilities. The study was rated as having a high risk of bias. Outcomes were measured at 6 months post intervention. Five out of 14 children were reported to have 'responded to treatment 'as measured by increases in TST (calculated from information collected by the study team during regular interviews with parents), which were reported to have improved post intervention. There were no serious adverse events. Finally, the relative effectiveness of faded bedtime and response costs with bedtime scheduling was investigated using a parallel RCT.157The trial took place in an inpatient unit for children with very severe behaviour problems. The children ( n=14, 7 per arm) recruited to the trial had a range of NDs and sleep disturbances relating to sleep maintenance and 'sleep consolidation '. They were aged 4 -14 years. The trial was rated as having a high risk of bias. Outcomes were measured pre intervention and 10 days post intervention. Only narrative reports of sleep outcomes (based on observational data) are provided. Overall, there is no evidence of benefit for weighted blankets, although we note that this was a single study that was rated as having a high risk of bias. Issues regarding study design and study bias mean that no conclusions can be drawn regarding the impact of the following interventions: valerian, fatty acid supplements, light therapy with daytime activities programme, acupuncture and ear-point taping, and an aquatic exercise programme. Finally, we note that the last two studies described157,158were both reported almost 25 years ago, and no further studies replicating these interventions are reported. It is questionable whether or not they remain relevant or accepted approaches to managing sleep disturbance in children with NDs. Issues of feasibility, acceptability and experiences of receiving and implementing a sleep management intervention Sixteen of the interventions included in the clinical effectiveness review also investigated the feasibility, acceptability and/or parent/clinician views of sleep disturbance interventions.36,49,106,107,122 -130Going forward, we use the term 'family experience 'to refer to this topic area.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk86Fourteen of these interventions were parent-directed interventions,21,49,107,123 -129,149the remaining two were evaluations of melatonin106and weighed blankets,36respectively. For 11 out of the 16 interventions, data on family experience are reported in papers alongside the presentation of data on outcomes. For one intervention,149these data are reported in a separate paper.122A further four interventions were collectively investigated with respect to the above issues and findings were reported separately to papers reporting intervention outcomes.130 No additional studies relevant to this topic were identified through searches. We would note that separate but relevant literature on parents 'views and attitudes towards pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbance in children with NDs was identified (e.g. Goodday et al.,180Keenan et al.181). However, this body of work did not fall within the scope of this review, as these studies explored parental views of multiple sleep interventions. A number of data collection methods were used, including questionnaires, structured interview and semistructured interviews (individual and group). Ten studies36,49,107,122 -125,127 -129devised an intervention evaluation questionnaire to explore family experience. One of these studies also included semistructured interviews with a subsample.124A further study used a modified version of a previously published intervention evaluation questionnaire.126All collected data from parents, apart from one study that sought children 's views about the weighted blanket they had been using.36 A further study used semistructured interviews to collect data from parents via individual interviews or groups.130Finally, one study reported data on reasons for study dropout. Appendix 19 reports the methods used.106 Quality appraisal The quality appraisal of 'family experience 'studies used the tool created by Hawker et al.,66chosen because it was developed for use in reviews in which both qualitative and quantitative data are included and data in this review have been generated by studies using different paradigms. The tool was used in two ways. First, for studies ( n=2) in which a primary objective was to investigate family experience, and this is reported in a separate paper, a full quality appraisal was conducted (see Appendix 20 ). Second, for studies ( n=10) in which 'family experience 'was a secondary study objective and was a minor element of evidence presented in any papers, the tool was used by the team to appraise, but not individually rate, the quality of the studies and evidence presented. One study106reported data that were a part of routine data collection within a trial (i.e. the reason for study dropout). We did not subject this specific element of the study to a separate quality appraisal. For the 10 studies36,49,107,123 -129for which 'family experience 'was a secondary objective, the quality of studies and study reporting was very mixed. A number of issues were frequently noted that affected the quality of the 'family experience 'objectives of these studies. First, family experience was sometimes not explicitly identified as a research objective. In addition, parent characteristics (e.g. gender, educational achievement, ethnicity and first language) were rarely reported. This is a significant omission, given that the majority of interventions represented in the 'family experience 'data set were parent-directed interventions. Data collection tools were inadequately reported and/or study-specific tools were developed that, it would appear, had not undergone any piloting or been developed in consultation with parents. Descriptions of the analysis of family experience data were typically missing or very limited. Analyses were descriptive and opportunities to explore factors affecting experiences were not exploited. Based on the description of the data collection instruments, it appeared that, in some studies, not all findings were reported. Findings Findings on family experience can be found in Appendix 19 .DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

No further data on family experience were identified with respect to the pharmacological interventions.106 Weighted blanket Children taking part in the RCT evaluating weighted blankets were asked to describe their feelings about using the study blanket using a three-point scale ( 'really liked ','just OK 'or'really disliked ').36A greater proportion of children in the intervention group reported liking their blanket, but the differences in responses between the intervention and control groups were not significant.36 Parent-directed interventions A number of themes, or topic areas, can be identified in the data reported: lparents 'experiences of accessing the intervention (e.g. time of day or competing demands on time) lparents 'experiences of implementing a sleep management strategy lparents 'views about the elements of the intervention that had an impact on the outcomes experienced lparents 'experiences as service users or of the process of receiving the intervention lrecommending the intervention to other parents. It should be noted that some data that were identified as potentially relevant to these topic areas were ambiguous and open to different interpretations; for example, 'satisfaction 'may refer to satisfaction with outcomes achieved or satisfaction with the way that an intervention is delivered. Data of this nature, although extracted and presented in Appendix 19 , are not reported in the following narrative. Parents 'experiences of accessing the intervention This topic was not widely or consistently explored. One study124reported that the majority of participants (five out of six) in their interview subsample believed that time pressures on parents and the time needed to make the initial commitment to embark on the intervention were barriers to parents accessing and completing such an intervention. In addition, one interviewee spontaneously mentioned that the time of day of the intervention was a 'least-liked 'element of the intervention. A further study126reported that the time-consuming nature of the intervention was identified as something that was 'least liked 'about the intervention they received. However, the authors do not clarify whether this refers to time attending sessions or the time required to implement a sleep management strategy. Johnson et al.107report data on very high levels of attendance at intervention sessions, which could be regarded as proxy evidence regarding the accessibility of the intervention. Parents 'experiences of implementing the sleep management strategy Five studies report parents 'views on the acceptability of the intervention, specifically the acceptability of the sleep management strategy that they were instructed to implement. Implementing new ways of managing sleep disturbance (e.g. not settling to sleep, night-time wakings) are likely to generate resistance and negative responses (e.g. crying) on the part of the child. Bramble122reported that a minority (3/15) of their sample found this process 'rather tough 'but were willing to continue. Two out of the twelve participants in Weiskop et al.126identified 'sticking to bedtime routine 'as the least-liked element of the intervention. Austin et al.123reports that three out of five parents in their study found that implementing sleep management strategies was stressful. However, Moss et al.124 reported that 21 out of 26 study participants described the implementation of the treatment plans as acceptable or very acceptable, and no improvements to the intervention were suggested. Both Austin et al.123and Weiskop et al.126also asked study participants if they would recommend the intervention to other parents and all said that they would.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk88Beresford et al.130describes parents 'accounts of the demands that implementing, and sustaining, a sleep management strategy can place on them. A number of barriers to implementation were also identified. These included lack of consistency across caregivers, changes and disruptions in usual routines (e.g. owing to illness or holidays) and difficulties with the home environment, particularly if the child had to share with siblings.130 Adherence to implementing a sleep management strategy is an additional facet to this topic. Two studies provided relevant data.107,125First, Scibberas et al.125reported that 'Most caregivers reported that they could implement sleep management strategies \"at least half of the time \"'. No further details are provided. Second, Johnson et al.107collected clinicians 'ratings of study participants 'adherence to the intervention (including evidence of implementation of sleep management strategies) based on their observations during intervention sessions. In this study, an attention control arm was used; the intervention delivered to this arm was purely educational and did not require parents to implement behaviour management strategies. Over 90% adherence was reported for both study arms (active arm, 93%, 75 -100%; control arm, 98%, 75 -100%). Parents 'views about the elements of the intervention that had an impact on the outcomes experienced Two approaches to exploring this topic were used. Some studies asked participants to rate the helpfulness, utility or relevance of a pre-set list of the different elements of the intervention they had received,107,122,123,125,128 although this varied in terms of how fine-grained the elements were. Overall, there is consistent evidence that parents report the training delivered via the interventions as relevant and useful. It is not clear from the way that the data are reported whether or not parents vary in which elements they find particularly helpful. Differences in data collection instruments and ambiguities of language make further synthesis of the data impossible. Other studies elicited parents '(spontaneous) views via interviews124,127,130or free-text responses in questionnaires.126Across these studies, the following were identified by parents as being important to supporting the achievement of positive sleep outcomes: receiving education on various aspects of sleep and sleep management,124,130training in specific strategies to manage problem behaviours (communication, behavioural or sensory),124,127,130that the intervention is tailored to the child,124,130provision of one-to-one instruction,126peer support via group delivery,130that attention is paid to developing parents 'confidence regarding their parenting,130use of mechanisms for keeping track of progress (e.g. sleep diary)130and giving implementation support.124,126,130 Parents 'experiences as service users or of the process of receiving the intervention The mode of delivery is a core element of the service user experience. This was evaluated in one of the trials included in the review.128This study also captured data on family experience, including preference regarding mode of delivery. A smaller proportion of study participants in the individual delivery arm reported that they would have preferred the alternative mode of delivery than those in the group delivery arm (3/41 vs. 8/39).128 There were limited data on this topic area. A single participant (1/12) in the study by Weiskop et al.126 found that the training sessions were too long. Reed et al.129reports that 10 out of 18 study participants believed that the duration of the intervention was sufficient. Recommending the intervention to other parents Five studies123,126,128,129,144specifically collected data on whether or not study participants would recommend the intervention to other parents. Three studies123,126,129reported that all parents receiving the intervention would recommend it to other parents. The other studies128,144reported that the great majority of study participants said that they would recommend the intervention. Malow et al.128compared the responses of parents receiving the intervention via individual face-to-face sessions with those receiving it via groupDOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

A greater proportion of study participants receiving the intervention face to face reported that they would recommend the intervention than those in the group delivery arm (38/41 vs. 32/39).128 Summary Thirteen studies concerning family experience of sleep management interventions were identified, reporting 16 sleep management interventions in total.36,49,106,107,122 -130All but one106of the studies concerned non-pharmacological interventions: 14 were parent-directed interventions49,107,122 -130and one was a study of weighted blankets.36For these studies, data were predominantly quantitative (total n=225) and typically collected using a questionnaire specifically designed for the study. One study124supplemented questionnaire data through semistructured interviews with a subsample ( n=6) of study participants. A further study130 (n=35), which investigated the family experience of four parent-directed sleep management interventions, used entirely qualitative methods. Study quality varied. The pharmacological study106reported data relevant to family experience106concerning difficulties administering the medication. This was reported within the context of reporting on reasons for study withdrawal, rather than the study explicitly seeking to include an exploration of the family experience along with the evaluation of the medicine.106 Therefore, the most extensive data set concerns parents 'experiences of receiving and implementing a sleep management intervention (11 studies21,49,107,123 -129,149). The data were organised around five themes: parents 'experiences of accessing the intervention, parents 'experiences of implementing a sleep management strategy, parents 'views about the elements of the intervention that had an impact on the outcomes experienced, parents 'experiences as service users and recommending the intervention to others. Across all these themes, the data are very limited. There are a number of reasons for this. First, the pool of studies is very small. Second, many studies collected very few data. Third, studies typically used their own data collection instrument, thus hindering the pooling of data. With these caveats, the following comments are made. There is very little evidence on parents 'experiences of accessing sleep management interventions. One study reported that parents believed that the time requirements associated with receiving a sleep management intervention could be a barrier to parents accessing an intervention.124Another found that the time-consuming nature of the intervention was a feature of the intervention that was 'least liked 'by some study participants.126However, across all studies, only one participant is reported as finding the duration of the intervention too long.126 Parents 'experiences of implementing a sleep management strategy were explored by five studies.107,122,123,126,130 A consistent theme across all -although it was not universally reported by study participants -is the challenges and demands placed on parents as they implement the strategy. Despite this, all of th e studies that asked parents if they would recommend the intervention to others reported unanimous or high levels of recommendation. On a related point, a further study144reported exploring parents 'judgements as to their adherence to a sleep management strategy and it suggests that consistent adherence to sleep manag ement interventions should not be assumed. Another study identified a range of factors that may further interfere with implementing a sleep management strategy.130 Support with implementing a sleep management intervention was consistently identified by studies that offer data on elements of interventions that parents believe support positive outcomes. In terms of mode of delivery, both individual work and group delivery are identified as supporting positive outcomes: one offering the opportunity for a highly tailored intervention and the other offering peer support.RESULTS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk90Chapter 4 Discussion Introduction Overall, the evidence on the management of sleep disturbance in children with NDs is very thin -in volume, scope and quality -particularly given that this group of conditions or diagnoses represents the majority of disabled children, and when the incidence and severity of sleep disturbance is greater than that for children with typical development. The conclusions that we have been able to draw regarding intervention effectiveness are limited to melatonin. Here, the conclusion is drawn that there is evidence of benefit; however, the clinical importance of the benefit is not certain. Therefore, there are no implications for health-care practice. This lack of evidence is more compelling -as is the argument for strategic investment in this topic -given our understanding of the health, social and economic impacts of sleep deprivation. It is not surprising that in a national research prioritisation exercise for children with NDs, the management of sleep disturbance was ranked in the top 10 research priorities,32with both pharmacological and parent-directed interventions specified. In this chapter, first, we present the strengths and limitations of the study and then public and pa tient involvement. Second, we discuss pharmacological interventions and principal findings with respec t to this intervention approach. Third, we consider parent-directed interventions, providing an overview of th ese interventions before reporting principal findings and discussing the implications of these findings. Fourth, we move on to discuss other non-pharmacological interventions, presenting the principal findings with re spect to this range of interventions. A final section discusses the issues and challenges for future resear ch in this area. Strengths and limitations of the study We undertook thorough searches for eligible studies that included systematic searches of 16 databases, without language restrictions, and included sources for unpublished studies. We used standard methods, for example having two researchers undertake key study processes such as study selection, to reduce error and bias. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed, although this assessment was often limited by poor reporting. We included small before-and-after studies that cannot provide a reliable estimate of the clinical effectiveness of an intervention because of the lack of a control group. These were included in order to help identify interventions that may be worth considering for evaluation in future RCTs. To militate against the limitations of some of the study designs included, we have clearly distinguished between randomised and non-randomised designs in the synthesis. We have also taken account of their limitations when drawing conclusions. Given the number of interventions that were under consideration, a mixed-treatment comparison would have been the ideal statistical approach, permitting ranking of the benefits and harms of the different treatment options.72However, owing to the heterogeneity of the non-pharmacological studies, statistical pooling was not considered appropriate. As a result of the sparsity of combined and sequential interventions and poor reporting of any prior interventions received by participants in studies, a robust analysis of the impact that single, combined and sequential interventions had on clinical effectiveness was not possible. Similarly, any other planned subgroup analysis was possible only for the melatonin trials and this was limited by the small number of studies and the potential for confounding with other study characteristics. It is not possible to blind the types of interventions and comparators used in the studies under consideration. In addition, owing to the nature of the outcomes measured, robust blinded outcome assessment is likely to be difficult. Although actigraphy-based child sleep outcomes are more objective than parent-reportedDOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

Therefore, all of the included non-pharmacological RCTs were rated as having a high risk of bias, even though blinding of treatment and comparator is not possible. For one study that compared a parent-directed tailored intervention with control,138this led to an overall rating of high risk of bias, despite all the other bias domains for that study being rating as having a low risk of bias. We acknowledge that applying the Cochrane criteria 'less strictly 'would have led to this study having an overall rating of low risk of bias. This is an issue for all non-pharmacological studies in this area and we believe that it is unhelpful to have these studies rated as having a high risk of bias, as evidence from non-pharmacological interventions will always look weaker than that from pharmacological studies. Equally, we acknowledge that there is a risk of overestimating the clinical effectiveness of an intervention in which allocation is unblinded and outcomes have an element of subjectivity and may be influenced by lack of blinding. There is currently no established method of blinded outcome assessment in this field that we are aware of and further work in this area may be beneficial. There may also be value in further consideration by methodologists about how lack of blinding is graded in studies when blinding is not possible and the outcomes are subjective. Adoption of statistical approaches used in surgical studies, such as secondary statistical analyses taking into account participants ' treatment allocation, may also have some value.182 Patient and public involvement Three parents of children with ND (two mothers and one father) acted as project advisors. They were recruited from a permanent parent consultation group of the chief investigator 's research unit. The children 's diagnoses were autism and a rare, genetic condition. The parents were invited to the project team meetings, which were held three times over the course of study and attended by the research team and all co-applicants. They were also occasionally consulted between meetings via e-mail. Each parent attended at least one meeting. At the first meeting, an early item on the agenda was a presentation of an overview of systematic reviews as a research method. At the meetings, parent s actively engaged in discussions. Their experiences also provided useful contextual information for the resea rch team, some of whom had no prior experience of working in this topic area or with this particular grou p of children. Pharmacological interventions Research on the management of sleep disturbance affecting children with NDs is domina ted by two intervention approaches: melatonin and parent-directed interventions. In terms of oth er pharmacological interventions, a small number of trials of other medicines were identified [ace butolol (Sectral\u00ae,P r o m i u sP h a r m a LLC, Princeton, NJ, USA ), eszopiclone (Lunesta\u00ae, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA), gabapentin Inc., New York City, NY, USA), ramelteon (Rozerem\u00ae, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, Osaka, Japan) and zolpidem (Ambien\u00ae, Sanofi S.A., Paris, France)] but fell outside the eligibility criteria set for this review (these criteria were decided in consultation with clinici ans). The review was, therefore, restricted to melatonin, clonidine and antihistamines. No studies of clo nidine or antihistamines that fulfilled our study inclusion criteria were identified. Principal findings: pharmacological interventions There was evidence of benefit of melatonin compared with placebo, although the precise extent of the benefit, which children may benefit the most and the clinical importance of the benefit remain uncertain. Discussion of principal findings: pharmacological interventions This conclusion concurs with the issues raised by the team that conducted the only trial of (fast-release) melatonin rated as having a low risk of bias included in the review.48In it, the study sample comprisedDISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk92children with developmental delay and some with additional diagnoses, including epilepsy, autism or a specific genetic or chromosomal disorder. The authors note that 'the sheer heterogeneity of the population studied has inevitably limited our ability to accurately estimate the impact of melatonin treatment for individual groups of patients with specific clinical (genetic), behavioural or developmental presentations '.48 A core inclusion criterion for the Appleton et al.48trial was that a parent-directed intervention -in the form of an advice booklet -had not successfully addressed the presenting sleep disturbance. For over half of the children recruited to the trial (56%), this intervention did not sufficiently address the sleep disturbance and they were randomised to the melatonin or placebo arms. This finding does lend support to the argument, and based on understandings of types and aetiologies of sleep disturbance in children with NDs, that pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches may both be required. It can also be taken to suggest that for some types of sleep disturbance, recourse to melatonin should occur only once attempts to change the way that a family may be managing the sleep disturbance have been tried. Parent-directed interventions Behavioural insomnias (difficulties with bedtime settling and self-settling after night wakings) are defined as sleep patterns and behaviours developed through unhelpful sleep behaviours and sleep management practices.183Parent-directed interventions seek to provide parents with the knowledge and skills to change these patterns and behaviours. This review adopted the term 'parent-directed interventions 'to refer to sleep management interventions that involve training parents to respond to their child 's sleep problems in different ways. The use of the term 'parent-directed 'was deliberate. It emphasises that the direct recipient of the intervention is the parent, not the child. The child is merely the recipient of the outcomes the intervention achieves with respect to the parent. This has implications for the way in which such interventions should be understood and evaluated. We categorised parent-directed interventions as comprehensive and non-comprehensive. Comprehensive interventions included training parents in evaluating the bedroom environment, paying attention to daytime and bedtime activities and routines (or sleep hygiene practices) and providing training in the use of particular behavioural strategies to manage specific problems related to settling and night waking. The majority of interventions were comprehensive, with two 'non-comprehensive 'interventions also being included: one evaluating training on particular behaviour management strategies only152and the other providing sleep hygiene training for parents of children with ADHD.155 We made a further distinction with respect to these interventions: tailored versus non-tailored. Tailored interventions consisted of an assessment of the child 's sleep and wider family context, which was then used to developed a personalised sleep management strategy. This approach necessarily meant that these interventions were delivered individually. They also all included implementation support, that is, contact between the practitioner and parent as the sleep management strategy in order to provide support or advice and/or suggest and supervise changes to the strategy. Non-tailored interventions, in contrast, comprised the delivery of a standard 'training curriculum 'in managing sleep disturbance in children with NDs. These were delivered via written material, in groups and/or individually. Some of these interventions had opportunities for parents to apply learning to their own child and/or implementation support. This review identified some core intervention characteristics by which these interventions could be classified: comprehensive versus non-comprehensive; tailored versus non-tailored; mode(s) of support; and condition-specific or generic ND.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

There was variability between interventi ons in terms of intervention characteristics, such as mode of delivery, intensity, durati on and availability of implementatio n support. Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as having a high or unclear risk of bias in reporting and, therefore, the findings of these studies cannot be considered robust. In terms of the tailored interventions, there was mixed evidence about the effects of these interventions on child (and parent) outcomes. There was limited evidence of benefit on more objective measures of sleep outcomes (actigraphy, verified or not with parent-completed sleep diaries). More evidence of benefit was found on parent-reported outcomes and a few parent outcomes. Conclusions are hampered by the limited number of RCTs, the multitude of outcome measures and the risk of studies being underpowered to detect an effect. Two small RCTs investigated specific intervention characteristics: mode of delivering implementation support21and a brief versus extended (with implementation support) version of an intervention.125The rating of a high risk of study bias and the trials being underpowered mean that no conclusions can be drawn. Compared with the tailored interventions, the non-tailored interventions evaluated were even more diverse in terms of a number of intervention characteristics, including mode of delivery [i.e. written material, group delivery (single vs. multiple sessions) and one-to-one work], the extent to which they accommodated parents 'individual learning and training needs and whether or not implementation support was available. Overall, the conclusions that can be drawn from this evidence are limited owing to the high risk of bias, the wide range in post-intervention follow-up time points and the risk of studies being underpowered to detect an effect. In addition, a large number of outcome measures were used, capturing a wide range of outcome domains. There was mixed and very limited evidence regarding the impact that the provision of written information to parents had on managing their child 's sleep disturbance. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the relative benefits of written versus face-to-face delivery of sleep management training to parents. There is some limited evidence of benefit for group-delivered interventions in terms of parent-reported sleep outcomes (but not reported for more objective measures of sleep). A single RCT128compared the individual delivery of an intervention via a single session with delivery of the same training via two group-delivered sessions. The rating of having a high risk of study bias and the trial being underpowered means that no conclusions can be drawn from the study findings. No RCTs were identified that evaluated a single-session workshop approach to delivering sleep management training to parents. It is useful to note that this mode of delivery is widely accessible to parents in the UK via statutory and non-statutory providers. Two non-comprehensive parent-directed interventions are also reported by this study. The first is a trial (rated as having a high risk of bias) that evaluated an intervention in which the content was restricted to training on behavioural principles of managing problem behaviour compared with an attention control intervention.152The content of the second intervention was restricted to sleep hygiene principles and practices,155which was evaluated using a before-and-after study design. Discussion of principal findings: parent-directed interventions It is relevant to briefly contextualise these findings on parent-directed interventions within the wider evidence base on the clinical effectiveness of parent-directed interventions for managing sleep in children with typical development. Here, a recent review, which identified 15 trials110,127,184 -197and 11 before-and- after studies,149,198 -208concluded that there was 'moderate support 'for such interventions for young children ( 5 years). A paucity of trials that included older children and adolescents limited any conclusions being drawn with respect to these older age groups.184The authors recommend that, for young children who have typical development and are healthy, parent-directed interventions should be implemented withDISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk94'no hesitation '. Furthermore, although noting the lack of evidence, the authors also recommend that they are used for older children and adolescents. For children with NDs, however, additional factors may be at play in the development of behavioural insomnias, which may have implications for the content and scope of the training and advice given to parents, the duration of support parents may require to implement new sleep management approaches and strategies and the clinical effectiveness of a parent-directed intervention.209These include communication difficulties (both parental communication about bedtime and sleep and the child 's ability to understand sleep cues or communicate their needs),210,211sensory sensitivities,209cognitive delay and arousal associated with daytime behaviour problems.212This has implications for the design of future evaluations. Parent-directed interventions as complex interventions: implications Parent-directed interventions to manage sleep disturbance in children with N Ds can be regarded as 'complex intervention ', that is, they comprise a number of different interconnected elements. Early g uidance, issued by the Medical Research Council on developing and evaluating complex interventi ons,213,214has subsequently been developed and refined, including the need for intervention development an d evaluation to be theory driven.215The theory underlying or informing an intervention will identify its 'active ingredients 'and the factors that may moderate or mediate their therapeutic action. Although accepted as a fun damental feature of pharmacological studies, the notion of 'active ingredients 'is as relevant and important to our understanding and evaluation of non-pharmacological interventions.216,217However, adoption of robust approaches to the evaluation of complex interventions, in which a theory of change has informed the st udy design and outcomes measured and the active ingredients are clearly defined and specified, remains pa tchy.218 Specifying a theory of change, and the active ingredients, to complex interventions suc h as parent-delivered sleep management interventions requires looking not only at content of the 'training 'delivered to parents, per se, but also at the features of the individuals involved in delivery, at the contex t, or mode, in which the training is delivered and in the implementation.216,219It would be fair to say that the influence of this thinking and methodological debate has, to date, had relatively little impact on evaluations o f parent-directed, sleep management interventions for children with NDs. Behavioural theories (e.g. extin ction, positive reinforcement) are explicitly identified as underpinning all the sleep management strategie s on which parents were trained in the comprehensive parent-directed interventions and one of the non-comprehensive inte rventions.152In addition, the influence of social learning theory220on choices about the techniques used to teach and train parents is apparent (e.g. the use of role-play, modelling, observation, group problem -solving). However, a theory of the process by which upskilling a parent in sleep management results in changes in a child 's sleep, and the factors that have an impact on that process, is left (relatively) undiscussed and unexplored. This is evidenced by the fact that only a small minority of the studies measured changes in pare nts'knowledge of sleep management, perceived parenting confidence, collected data on parents 'characteristics and/or sought to assess the extent to which parents accurately or consistently applied their train ing. The evidence reviewed regarding the 'family experience 'of parent-directed sleep management interventions offers some, limited, insights into the process by which parent-directed interventions affect ch anges in the duration or quality of a child 's sleep and the factors that parents believe facilitate or hinder this process. However, the story appears complex. Thus, for example, although support with implementing new approac hes to managing their child 's sleep disturbance was consistently identified as a valued or helpful aspect of the intervention received by parents, views on mode of delivery revealed that there were different benefits in group versus individual delivery. Exposure to other parents 'experiences and access to peer support were identified as supporting positive outcomes. In terms of individually delivered intervention s, a key benefit reported by parents was the scope to personalise an intervention to the child and the family 's specific needs and context. It is also important to note that parents are likely to vary in their abilities, capacities and/or willingness to access the different modes of delivery.221DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

We have included them in this review but their current relevance may be open to question. Principal findings There was no evidence that weighted blankets -an intervention that parents can purchase and use without professional supervision or receive via a prescription from statutory health services -were clinically effective. Issues of study design and ratings of high risk of study bias mean that no conclusions can be drawn regarding the impact of the following interventions: valerian, fatty acid supplements, light therapy with daytime activities programme, acupuncture and ear-point taping and the aquatic exercise programme. Future research: overarching issues and challenges A key aim of this review was to make recommendations regarding priorities for future research on this topic. In this section, we consider some overarching issues and challenges. Outcomes and outcome measurement A number of issues need to be addressed in future research to generate robust and meaningful evidence that, in future reviews, can be subject to meta-analysis. First, a large number of different child sleep outcomes and measurement tools were used by the studies included in this review. Our synthesis of the studies was partly hampered by this diversity of outcome measures in relation to both child sleep outcomes and other outcomes for children and their parents. Only TST was measured in the majority of studies and assessed in a similar way across studies. We would note that when evidence of benefit of a sleep management intervention was reported -and actigraphy and parent-report measures were used -benefit was more frequently observed with respect to parent-reported measures. It is not clear whether this is because of issues of objectivity versus subjectivity in outcome measurement or that these different measurement approaches are capturing qualitatively different outcomes. Adverse events were reported in the majority of melatonin trials. However, the type of adverse event reported, data collection methods used and reporting of adverse events varied. Standardisation of the reporting and data collection methods for adverse events in future trials is important to understand the safety of pharmacological interventions. This also has relevance for non-pharmacological studies, in which interventions may have unintended consequences. There were two additional issues: (1) variability in the outcome domains of interest, for example carer outcomes were assessed in some studies and not others and (2) variability in the measure used to assess specific outcome domains. Previous research has identified sleep as a key health outcome for children and young people with ND, their parents30and health-care professionals.222However, based on searches of the Core Outcome Measures In Effectiveness database (www.comet-initiative.org; accessed 21 June 2017), no work has been undertaken to prioritise outcomes for children with NDs who experience sleep disturbances and their parents. A core outcome set would greatly assist the usefulness of research in this field, in which there are so many management options, allowing comparison between studies and also ensuring that the outcomes that are assessed are of relevance to children, their parents and also the health-care professionals involved in their care.DISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk96Second, further work with families to establish what constitutes a meaningful and worthwhile change in these outcome measures is important. Just one study49adopted this approach, with a 50% reduction in the composite sleep disturbance score identified by parents participating in the study as the minimum change for the intervention to be considered worthwhile. Meaningful and sufficient change may also have guided the duration of implementation support in interventions in which the duration of this was reported as variable, or needs-led,21,124,146but the heuristic for ceasing implementation support was not explicitly reported. Furthermore, other studies reported an extended period of implementation support but it was not clear whether this duration was predetermined or simply what actually occurred when the intervention was delivered. An alternative, or additional, approach used by a small number of studies was the setting of parent-identified goals for their child 's sleep, with progress towards these goals tracked over follow-up time points. However, none of these studies used Goal Attainment Scaling methodology,223,224which allows identification of, and tracking of progress towards, personalised intervention goals, with the creation of an aggregated score for each study participant, and allows robust comparisons between participants. This would appear to be a measurement approach worth considering in future research, alongside objective and other parent-reported outcome measures, as is the case in evaluations of complex interventions in other fields.225 Third, consistency in follow-up time points based on an evidence-informed theory of change is required. This is particularly an issue for non-pharmacological interventions in which the implementation of newly acquired knowledge and skills in managing a child 's sleep may take time to have an effect. Thus, within the different types of parent-directed interventions, consensus is required as to the most clinically meaningful follow-up time points and whether or not evaluations should seek to also investigate maintenance of outcomes. This would also assist in comparisons between studies in future systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Fourth, further work is required to identify other relevant child outcome measures andthe time points at which such outcomes should be measured. Cognitive ability is an important example here. Little is understood about the benefits of (even small) cumulative gains in sleep in terms of arresting neuronal and cognitive loss.226Thus, the identification of appropriate follow-up time points and meaningful measures of cognition, an outcome that is challenging to accurately capture in children with severe learning disabilities, are essential. The selection of other child outcome measures also needs to be evidence based and informed by the intervention 's theory of change for that outcome. Fifth, for parent-directed interventions, the development and application of a theory of change is required in the selection of appropriate outcomes. This is because children 's sleep outcomes will be mediated by the outcomes for parents achieved by the intervention, that is, the acquisition of new knowledge and understanding of sleep, and training in managing sleep disturbance. Furthermore, evidence from the wider literature on parenting interventions indicates that the extent to which these parent-centred outcomes are achieved are mediated/moderated by a number of factors, located in parent, practitioner and intervention characteristics. Only a minority of parent-directed interventions captured outcomes in this domain. Similarly, few studies report parent characteristics. The design of evaluations As we have noted earlier, evaluations need to be designed in such a way that the evidence generated addresses the key questions of what works, for whom and in what circumstances? Interestingly, a similar call for evidence has been made with respect to evaluation of similar interventions for children with typical development.184It would be informative to explore subgroup analyses within any future trials. In order to make any analyses more credible, it will be important to define these subgroups in advance, and the direction of effect, based on existing evidence.227,228Depending on the evaluation, subgroups may be in terms of sleep problem, child, parent or intervention characteristics. In addition, for parent-directed interventions, RCTs need to incorporate measures of adherence and/or fidelity. These are loosely defined concepts.

Only one study125attempted to assess this in any way, relying on parents 'reports of the proportion of times that they implemented the new sleep management strategy. There are clearly significant challenges related to the feasibility and costs associated with measuring parent 's adherence and fidelity to a sleep management strategy given the time of day when parents will be implementing a sleep management strategy and the home setting. Methodological research will be required to inform incorporating this into study designs. Finally, the final follow-up time point for most studies allowed consideration of short-term outcomes only. Future studies need to consider what longer-term follow-ups should be incorporated into study designs. Evidence on longer-term outcomes is particularly pertinent for parent-directed interventions that require significant investment in parents ', as well as practitioners ', time, physical and emotional resources (and potentially entail significant, if short-term, disruption to the family). If available, such evidence would support shared decision-making regarding the management of a child 's sleep disturbance. Moving towards replication At the moment, the evidence base predominantly comprises single evaluations of interventions. These are principally either investigations into the management of sleep disturbance by a particular clinic or are (typically) early evaluations of a newly developed intervention, prior to its implementation into routine practice. There are just two instances of some sort of replication study; however, in both,123,124,128,129there are differences between the studies in the way the intervention was delivered. A taxonomy by which interventions should be defined and adherence to Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) guidance164in study reporting would support both replication and future evidence syntheses.DISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk98Chapter 5 Conclusions Implications for health care The poor quality of evidence and/or uncertainty regarding the clinical significance of findings mean that there are no implications for health-care practice. Recommendations for research Randomised controlled trials are required to assess a range of possible treatment options for sleep disturbance in children with ND. Future trials need to be informed by a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which non-pharmacological interventions may have an impact on a child 's sleep and on outcomes and outcome measurement. Developing an understanding of these mechanisms will require mixed-methods research. Future research needs to take account of the range of types, or aetiologies, of sleep disturbance, including behavioural, physiological (e.g. heightened arousal, anxiety or atypical melatonin profiles) and disorders of the circadian rhythm,230which will vary between NDs. We would also highlight that reporting was poor across RCTs, before-and-after studies and in studies reporting parents 'views and experiences of sleep management interventions. This was particularly the case for the non-pharmacological interventions. Future research should follow the appropriate reporting standards for the specific study design (www.equator-network.org; accessed 21 June 2017), including giving detailed description of the interventions using the TIDieR checklist.164Within the TIDieR checklist, it is important that sufficient detail is given on the specific curricula/training content of each intervention and the techniques used to teach and train parents. Bearing all of these issues in mind, we recommend that the topic areas listed below are priorities for future research. Generating robust evidence in these topic areas will support clinicians (and families) to make evidence-informed decisions about the identification, prevention and management of sleep disturbance in children with NDs. It will also support evidence-informed decision-making with respect to commissioning of services. The suggested areas for future research are quite diverse. Although necessarily presented in an order, it would seem important that all key stakeholders contribute to any prioritisation processes. lThe development of a core outcome set would be beneficial. This should be developed in consultation with parents and carers, the children themselves, when possible, and health-care professionals and others involved in supporting parents and children, using a structured process such as that developed by the Core Outcome Measures In Effectiveness group.231Similarly, standardising the adverse events recorded, data collection methods used and level of detail reported is important for future evaluations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. lIf not already recently conducted, a review of existing tools, practices and strategies to identify sleep disturbance in children with NDs that are appropriate and feasible for use in routine practice is recommended. lIf available in a suitable preparation for the population under consideration, a trial comparing a slow-release formulation of melatonin with a fast-release formulation of melatonin is suggested. lThere are a range of possible other pharmacological interventions for this population, such as clonidine, but eligible studies were not identified. Prioritisation of evaluations of alternative pharmacological options to melatonin (e.g. clonidine) is recommended.DOI: 10.3310/hta22600 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2018 VOL. 22 NO. 60 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2018.

Studies of this nature are required because children may present with different types of sleep disturbance and/or sleep problems. Specifically, an apparent subclinical benefit of melatonin in managing sleep initiation difficulties may be beneficial in supporting the impact that a parent-directed intervention has. We recommend trials to investigate this. lParent-directed interventions range considerably in the intensity of practitioner input, from the simple provision of written material through to extended one-to-one contact and incorporati on of implementation support. Studies are required that will support clinician and parent decision-making re garding the appropriate intervention. Evaluations of parent-directed interventions that a llow for comparison of the relative impacts/clinical effectiveness of different features of the interventions (e.g. mode of delivery, group vs. individual and the nature of implementation support) are recommended, which shoul d incorporate an investigation into issues of feasibility and acceptability. Prioritisation of interve ntions to address sleep initiation is suggested. lNone of the studies included in this review was presented as a preventative intervention. Rather, clinical cut-off points of sleep disturbance severity and/or parent reports of a sleep disturbance that had extended over some period of time were among study eligibility criteria. However, some types of sleep disturbance are preventable and/or amenable to early intervention. The brief, less-intense, parent-directed interventions included in this review (e.g. provision of information, single-session group intervention or face-to-face intervention) would, however, appear to align with a preventative or early intervention approach. Evaluating these types of intervention approaches in terms of the impact that they have on preventing the development of sleep disturbance, per se, or in preventing a newly emerging sleep disturbance increasing in severity is recommended. lStudies that map current practices and provision and research into families 'understanding of sleep disturbance and their experiences of seeking help are recommended. These would provide useful evidence to support the development of provision. Finally, and across all topic areas, we would recommend that evaluations include a comprehensive and holistic economic evaluation, including costs to families.CONCLUSIONS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk100Acknowledgements We would like to thank our parent advisors for their interest in and enthusiasm for the project and their contributions at project meetings.

In two cases participants were unblinded in order to treat serious adverse events Unclear Authors argue that researchers and participants did not know which arm they were in (there were four arms in total). Although this is plausible for the melatonin only and placebo-only arms, in which the capsules were identical, it is less plausible for the melatonin combined with CBT and the CBT only, as they would obviously know if they were receiving CBT. Similarly, the principal investigators (PIs) observed tapes of the CBT for adherence to protocol, so they would know at least who was receiving CBT (even if they could not know if they were receiving this alone or with melatonin ), so this is in agreement with the above judgementNo None were lost to follow-up but 16 dropped out owing to difficulties in administering medication, non-compliance and lack of improvement. An additional 10 were excluded from analysis owing to missing actigraphy data. The final analysis excluded all above. There were no details of the potential implications of missing data/dropouts. All six dropouts in placebo group were because of lack of improvement; none of the dropouts in the other groups were for this reasonUnclear No protocol is referenced in the paper and one was not found on searching. The study reports outcomes that one would expect. However, table 3 reports two outcomes that are not referred to anywhere else in the paper (Naptime and Bedtime). It is not clear what they are In the methods section, the paper only states what the primary outcomes were and so it is presumed that Naptime and Bedtime are secondary, but this is not stated so there is a low degree of selective reporting, as the authors state that groups and clinicians were unaware of what they were receiving and both groups were treated as per an identical protocolYes N/AAPPENDIX 6 NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk186StudyDomain 1: adequate sequence generation?2: allocation concealment? 3: blinding?4: incomplete outcome data addressed? 5: free of selective reporting? 6: free of other bias?Additional questions for crossover trials Van der Heijden et al.111Unclear Randomisation in blocks of four to keep number in each treatment group closely balanced.

Reasons were sleep diaries not completed/actigraphy data not readable ( n=2 placebo, n=1 melatonin); actigraphy treatment phase (melatonin) ( n=1); actigraphy watch taken off in first phase (placebo) ( n=1); study protocol not followed ( n=1).

The outcomes reported are those that are expected. However, without a protocol, it is difficult to be certainUnclear Authors report that normality assumption for parametric paired test was violated owing to highly skewed data and presence of outliers. The authors present both parametric and non-parametric analyses. The authors imply in the discussion that some families may have been practising sleep hygiene, with variability in this. There is no further information about this but the implication is that this was possible and not minimised or controlled.

Yes Is it clear that the order of receiving treatments was randomised? No Can it be assumed that the trial was not biased from carry-over effects? No. No washout period was used between crossover. The authors say that this is because of the half-life of melatonin but is this conclusive? Different studies have used different approaches -some having a washout period and others not. It is not clear or certain if this could present a bias Are unbiased data available?

However, the only outcome reported is changes in sleep pattern, which is reported as whether or not there was a response to treatment (with little detail on what exactly was measured). There are no data presented regarding what this response was and it is, thus, rather vague. Perhaps this is because it was a dose-finding RCT, but even so, the lack of detail on the outcome makes the reporting appear selective and lacks transparencyNo Participants had already been treated with another form of melatonin.

'For example: If the child did not settle to sleep in less than 30 minutes on any night in the week, a parent report of 100% level of success would have been achieved when the child settled to sleep in less than 30 minutes, 6 nights a week.

The length of night wakings was subtracted if these data were available Child 's sleep behaviour goalsGAS The GAS was used to assess the clinical significance of any changes in child 's sleep behaviour and to provide a quantifiable measure of intervention success. The GAS was based on parent-stated goals: a separate GAS was developed for each sleep behaviour identified by parents as a goal for behaviour change. For each behaviour, 0% success was set as the baseline rate of that behaviour. The parents and therapists decided what total success (100%) meant before the intervention. This did not have to mean elimination of the sleep problem but related to the level of improvement that the parents thought would make a difference to their lives and was developmentally appropriate. Post intervention, the change in each behaviour was expressed as a percentage of success over baseline.

The form includes 100 problem items -99 closed- ended items and one open-ended item that requests respondents add any additional problems not previously listed. Parents rate each item as 0 not true, 1 for somewhat true and 2 for very true or often true. A total problem score is calculated by totalling the scores on all of the items, including emotional reaction, anxious/ depressed syndrome, somatic complaints, withdrawal, sleep problems, attention problems and aggressive behaviour. The internalising score is the sum of the scores on items in the withdr awal, somatic complaints and anxious/depressed syndrome profiles. The externalising score is the s um of the scores on the items on attention problems and aggressive symptoms.

Therefore, it was not possible to compare baselines and interventions in 'real ' time. The follow-up period immediately after the intervention is not reported, so it is not clear what the 'after 'measurement relates to.
