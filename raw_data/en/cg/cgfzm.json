One cause is data gaps; with less clinical research on women, children, certain ethnic groups and older people, the medications and treatments offered sometimes do not achieve the intended clinical result because they have not been tested on a representative group. There is a risk that such biases and data gaps will be amplified through data driven medicine if artificial intelligence replicates existing biases. The talk will evaluate how the EU legal framework governing processing of health data accounts for the need to prevent and remediate biases focused on collection and use of health data for scientific research purposes using a human rights lens.

We were saddened to cancel this year's Annual Health Law Professors Conference due to COVID-19.

The Jay Healey Teaching Session Goes Virtual! event will included discussions on: \u00b7 Best practices for online learning; \u00b7 Identifying and generating asynchronous content; \u00b7 Promoting diversity of thought and engagement among students via online teaching tools; \u00b7 Adapting to pandemic conditions; and \u00b7 More! Tuesday, June 2, 2020 #COVIDLawBriefing 25 [Equitable Enforcement](https://www.publichealthlawwatch.org/covid19-briefings) As COVID-19 inflicts disproportionate harm on communities of color, inequitable enforcement of public health policies in response to the pandemic further widens health disparities. Police are strictly enforcing stay-at-home orders in some communities of color, while employing more lenient approaches in predominantly white communities. At the same time, enforcement of some laws designed to protect health and safety\u2014from local housing codes to federal environmental laws like the Clean Air Act\u2014has been suspended during the emergency response. This Briefing will discuss inequitable enforcement of public health laws and options that government officials should consider in order to promote more equitable outcomes during the pandemic and in the long-term, after the public health crisis subsides.

Gregg Gonsalves is an epidemiologist and global health advocate integrating his experiences as a community activist with quantitative analysis and operations research to improve responses to global public health challenges. For nearly three decades, Gonsalves was an HIV/AIDS activist, working with domestic and international organizations such as AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and the AIDS and Rights Alliance for Southern Africa. His efforts to connect the HIV/AIDS community with top-tier researchers and scientists were a critical catalyst to fundamental advances in scientific knowledge of the disease.

Over the last decade, striking innovations, including artificial intelligence, robotics, mobile technology, gene therapies, pharmaceuticals, big data analytics, tele- and virtual health care delivery, have been developed as new entities and modes of delivery, from accountable care organizations (ACOs) to retail minute-clinics, have entered the market. More dramatic innovations and market disruptions are likely in the years to come. These new technologies and market disruptions offer immense promise to advance health care quality and efficiency, as well as improve provider and patient engagement. Success will depend, however, on careful consideration of potential perils and well-planned interventions to ensure new methods ultimately further, rather than diminish, the health of patients, especially those who are the most vulnerable.

Dr. Miller's suicide scholarship underscores the importance of efforts that reduce not only suffering that leads people to attempt suicide, but also ready access to highly lethal methods used in suicidal acts, such as firearms. Dr. Miller's work has contributed to the empirical evidence supporting the observation that suicide risk for individuals and suicide rates for populations can be greatly reduced by reducing access to firearms and other highly lethal suicide methods, even in the absence changes in underlying psychiatric illness or even suicidal behavior. In addition to empirical work in injury prevention, Dr. Miller's scholarship includes work that focuses on the fundamental and often unrecognized tension between research and therapy in clinical trials. Dr. Miller is Assistant Editor of the journal Injury Epidemiology and a recipient of the Excellence in Science Award from the American Public Health Association.
