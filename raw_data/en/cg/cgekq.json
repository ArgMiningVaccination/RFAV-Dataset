College of Southern Idaho Annual Report Dr. Jerry Beck of the College of Southern Idaho pr esented the College's annual report to the Board. He introduced Dr. Jeff Fox, Chief Academic Officer and Vice President of CSI. Dr. Beck summarized the mission of the College and discussed various activities underway including service to diverse populati ons, providing for the region's economic needs, collaborating with K -12, and partnering with other universities. He noted that in spite of the economic downturn, the College experienced growth in enrollments, the start -up of new programs, the receipt of a number of grants, and the continued commitment of faculty and staff to the students at CSI. Dr. Beck reported that CSI was able to close the FY09 budget in the black and to start the FY10 budget in the black. Dr. Beck briefly reported on the benchmarks of enrollment, access, cost, dual credit, and economic development. He noted that the cost to attend CSI has continued to remain low compared to the four-year institutions. He indicated that CSI began charging the students per credit several years ago, and students now pay 33% of the cost of the institution. The reason for this is that the College is growing very fast and enrollments are going up. Dr. Beck reported continued success in business recruitment despite the economic downturn. An example of that success is the opening of the Health Sciences and Human Services Building. This building was made possible in part by the financial assistance from a large number of partners throughout the region. Dr. Beck reported that the support of the CSI Foundati on towards scholarships has made it possible for more students to attend College. He noted that the additional funds that Idaho's colleges recently received from the Albertson Foundation will give even more students access to postsecondary education, stat ewide. State Superintendent Luna thanked Dr. Beck for CSI's efforts related to the Idaho Education Network. Dr. Beck gave several examples of courses that will be available to the districts via the IEN when it is in place. Mr. Luna asked if the dual credit courses offered through CSI are recognized by other institutions. Dr. Beck indicated that the colleges and institutions within Idaho do recognize and accept those credits. 2. Presidents' Council Report Dr. Dene Thomas from Lewis -Clark State College reported to the Board on behalf of the Presidents' Council. Dr. Thomas noted that a number of topics were discussed by the Presidents' Council in recent meetings. One item discussed was the statewide longitudinal data system. Each institution provided Board staff with the names of representatives from their campuses who will work together on that effort. Other items discussed included the proposed revisions and updates to Board policy. The Presidents' Council also discussed higher education's responsibility to the state's economic recovery. Dr. Thomas noted that there will be a luncheon for legislators on February 1, 2010. It will give the presidents an opportunity to share their common concerns and suggestions. Boardwork February 18, 2010 BOARDWORK 6 The Presidents' Council discuss ed the collaboration of services including gaining more independence from state agencies and services. The institutions discussed an opt -in/opt -out option in terms of the level of dependence on those state agencies and services because not all of the institutions are able to sustain or carry out those services on their own. President Robert Kustra of Boise State University noted that this will allow for greater flexibility for the institutions. In response to a question about cost -savings as a result of collaboration between the colleges and universities, Dr. Thomas explained that there would be resulting efficiencies, but not an immediate cost-savings. Dr. Kustra discussed the pooling of health insurance coverage and noted it may produce some kind of savings because of the type of coverage that could be provided to the pool. He pointed out that it's not just about saving new dollars, but also about recovering dollars. It was noted there is serious concern about the state's new practice of taking funds away from the institutions related to health insurance. Dr. Jerry Beck indicated that the institutions will now be required to come up with additional funds to meet the health insurance burden which is detrimental to the institutions. 3. ACT - 50th Anniversary Recognition Mark Browning of Board staff introduced Stacey Elmore of ACT to present to the Board. Ms. Elmore discussed the history of ACT and the efforts that have been undertaken over the years, current outcomes, national and statewide trend, and student achievement results. During her presentation, a request was made by the Board that ACT provide them with the disaggregated data from each district. Ms. Elmore agreed to make sure that happens. State Superintendent Luna noted that the entire cl ass of 2013 is required to take an ACT -type test before they graduate. 4. Board of Education By -Laws - Second Reading M/S (Soltman/Atchley): To approve the second reading of the proposed amendments to the Idaho Board of Education Governing Policies a nd Procedures By -Laws as submitted. Motion carried unanimously. Board member Soltman introduced this item. He noted that between the first and second reading minor changes were made in the language for the purpose of clarification based on recommendations from the Board. 5. P-20 Statewide Longitudinal Data System Grant Proposal M/S (Soltman/Edmunds): To approve the grant application submitted on December 4, 2009 for the development of a statewide P -20 and workforce longitudinal data system as submitted. Motion carried unanimously. Board member Soltman introduced this item. Executive Director, Mike Rush, acknowledged the input and the efforts of a number of people statewide in the development of the grant application. He introduced Selena Grace of the Board office to provide additional information. Ms. Grace indicated that there are nine outcomes as part of the grant. The U.S. Department will assess those components and determine which ones it will fund. While there are certain interdependencies, some stand alone. Board member Edmunds asked if the grant is scalable in such a way that it can be made to work should the U.S. Department award a lesser amount of funds than what has been requested. Ms. Grace explained that the U.S. Department will f und outcomes, not dollar requests. What this means Boardwork February 18, 2010 BOARDWORK 7 is if an outcome is not funded, dollars from another outcome cannot be redirected to cover it. It was noted that two of the outcomes related to interstate collaboration which puts Idaho within the guidel ines of the grant criteria in terms of the full amount that can be requested. For the benefit of the Board, State Superintendent Luna briefly updated the Board on the history of this effort over the past few years. 6. State Board of Education - Strate gic Planning Board member Soltman presented this item. He introduced Tracie Bent of the Board office to discuss specifics. Ms. Bent noted that the goals, objectives, and performance measures that are in the Board materials are a result of input and disc ussion from the November 9, 2009 strategic planning meeting. Ms. Bent asked what the will of the Board was in terms of what it wants to include in its strategic plan. Board member Westerberg asked about the process and timelines from this point on. He suggested reducing the number of objectives and performance measures. Ms. Bent indicated it would be good to have the work completed by the Board's February meeting. Dr. Rush noted that the institutions and agencies will have to rely on what the Board has already done because they will be doing their strategic plans in the next few months. Technically this plan doesn't have to be approved for state purposes until July 1. Board member Edmunds indicated that the general concept of where we are going stil l bothers him. His perception is that there are some good ideas, but there doesn't seem to be a focus. He would like there to be a better connection between the many various items listed in the draft and the end result. Ms. Bent reminded the Board that t heir planning meeting of November 9 resulted in the document being presented at this meeting. She acknowledged that in order to get to the point where Board member Edmunds wants, the Board needs to continue the discussion among its members. Board member Westerberg asked how to structure this effort so the process keeps moving forward. Board member Agidius noted that the Board must keep in mind what it is trying to accomplish each time it makes a decision. The document itself won't guarantee something gets done. Board member Edmunds suggested one of the goals should be the general oversight of education. Ms. Bent acknowledged that is an admirable goal, but the staff at the Board office and at the institutions needs to know specifically where the Boar d wants to go. Board member Soltman suggested that the Board needs to have a working session where the members can have that deeper discussion. Board member Westerberg noted that the Board is in a place where it has a framework it can work with. He noted that he didn't have trouble with the goals, but agreed that the objectives needed more work. He suggested that a smaller group could be convened to work on this effort in order to have something for February. Board member Edmunds reminded the Board that group has actually been established. Board member Westerberg suggested that the other Board members can direct comments to that group and to the Board staff so they can rationalize it and make sense of it before the February meeting. Board member Edmunds observed that the Board is looking at having an interim strategic plan with the idea that it will continue to look at longer -range goals. Board member Westerberg agreed that a lot of good work has already been done and that this plan is a framework to continue building upon. He reminded the group that a strategic plan is always a work in progress. Boardwork February 18, 2010 BOARDWORK 8 Dr. Rush pointed out the strategic planning process is an interim process by virtue of the fact that circumstances are always changing. He agreed that t he effort of planning is hard work and emphasized that it is not just a technical process. He indicated that the goals of the Education Alliance of Idaho are embedded in the Board's strategic plan. Dr. Rush also pointed out that this plan addresses the system and so there are thousands of people and millions of dollars required to implement this plan. As to how that relates to the Board, the Board needs an executive document that defines the goals and objectives of the system, but also includes perhaps three or four things that are the Board's special focus for the year. Board President Agidius noted that the Board's Executive Committee along with Board member Westerberg's involvement can hammer out the details. Board member Atchley agreed that given the size of the education system in Idaho and all the entities involved, this document is not too big. It can be fine- tuned. Mr. Agidius noted that some of the goals are things that the Board will always be striving toward because they are ongoing goals . He agreed it is a good document to start with, and that the Board can pick out things it wants to work on. Board member Edmunds reminded the Board about the pressing economic situation and the legislative and political constraints that drive timelines. He expressed concern about the Board's ability to respond to issues in a way that brings appropriate or immediate results given those hurdles. Board President Agidius said those issues need to be brought to the attention of the Board's Executive Committ ee so that they can be addressed. Board member Soltman indicated that staff needs direction from the Board. Ms. Bent will arrange a meeting with the strategic planning group to further hash this out. She asked that the Board members forward their comm ents on the performance measures and objectives to her prior to that meeting. Benchmarks also need to be set. The Board agreed with the direction of this process. At this time, Dr. Rush introduced Scott Gro the to the Board. He is the newest staff member of the Board office and will be working as the Program Manager of Accountability. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS 1. Boise State University - New Graduate Program - Full Proposal - Master in Chemistry M/S (Edmunds/Soltman): To approve t he request by Boise State University to offer a Master of Science in Chemistry. Motion carried unanimously. Board member Edmunds introduced this item and noted it has been reviewed by CAAP. Board member Westerberg asked about allocating resources to thi s program as opposed to somewhere else given that this degree is offered at two other institutions. Dr. Sona Andrews of BSU noted that the University was able to find a number of efficiencies to allow for a reallocation of faculty member's time from the undergraduate program to the graduate program. Two graduate assistant positions were added and will allow for instruction to both the upper and undergraduate programs. Dr. Andrews noted that the chemistry department has experienced a significant increase in grants over the past few years which speak to the quality of the faculty that will be able to deliver the program. She noted that BSU does have an existing evaluation process that ensures programs that are being offered are of continued value, need, and efficiency. Dr. Andrews introduced Professor Owen McDougal to respond to questions about the program. Matt Freeman of the Board office came forward to clarify a concern about the funding. Dr. Andrews noted that BSU looks at the revenue funds and the w orkload adjustment funds and assumes that Boardwork February 18, 2010 BOARDWORK 9 those funds will help with this program. If that is not the case, the University will still be able to fund the program. Board member Westerberg asked the Board staff to provide a matrix in future requests that s hows which programs and degrees are offered by the various colleges and universities. The Board members need this kind of information if they are to make informed decisions. 2. University of Idaho - Supplemental Report on Research and Extension Centers M/S (Edmunds/Westerberg): To approve the request by the University of Idaho for approval of the Collaborative Research Facility Agreement and License in substantial conformance to the draft submitted to the Board in Attachment 1; and to authorize the Pr esident or the President's designee to execute the same and any collateral documents necessary to bring the agreement into effect. Motion carried unanimously. Board member Edmunds presented this item and provided background information. Dr. Duane Nellis of University of Idaho discussed various points and introduced Kent Nelson, UI legal counsel. Mr. Nelson introduced Dean John Hammel to present and overview of the Parma Research and Extension Center, and the collaborative research facility agreement and license goals and details. It was noted that the agreement is between the University and the J.R. Simplot Company and it will provide funding in the amount of $300,000 for 2010 through 2014 for the Parma Research and Extension Center. The funds will be used to pay the University's labor, materials, and other operating costs directly applicable to management and operation of the land and facilities provided by the University under the agreement. The funds will contribute to costs associated with the University's overall maintenance of the Parma Center. Dr. Hammel noted that the agreement with Simplot is sufficient to maintain operations at the Parma Center in the Field Crop area. UI is also working with other entities on modular agreements for future external operational support of the Specialty and Seed Crop industry, and the Tree Fruit and Table Grape industry. The overall result is that a full complement of UI research will continue at Parma. Dr. Hammel noted that as the University moves forward, a ll the funds will be from public and private sources, and non- state funded sources. Any further reductions in the University budget will not have any impact except perhaps when it comes to positions. Board member Edmunds asked about intellectual proper ty and how that will be handled. He suggested that Board policy would indicate that when Idaho's universities conduct research with industry, the financial earnings need to go to the university. This agreement builds a firewall that says that the researc h done by Simplot remains Simplot's, unless the University of Idaho is involved in the research. Kent Nelson explained that the language in this agreement is fairly standard language and that it works within Board policy. It is intended to convey to priv ate industry the details necessary for them to understand. Mr. Nelson noted that the agreement is written in such a way that the private party has been advised. Board Edmunds reported that he has asked Board staff to work with Board counsel to study the Board's policy related to this issue to make sure that it is clear. Dr. Nellis noted that he appreciates the Board's interest in looking at the policy further. As a result of the action on item two, items three, four, and five were withdrawn from the agenda. By unanimous consent the Board agreed to withdraw items three, four, and five. 3. Withdrawn Boardwork February 18, 2010 BOARDWORK 10 4. Withdrawn 5. Withdrawn 6. Second Reading, Amendment to Board Policy III.Y. -- Advanced Opportunities, Idaho Standards M/S (Edmunds/Westerberg): To approve the second reading of the proposed amendments to Board Policy III.Y. -- Advanced Opportunities. Motion carried unanimously. 7. Establish an Assessment Oversight Committee to the Board M/S (Edmunds/Soltman): To approve establishing a commit tee to oversee the statewide assessment system. Substitute M/S (Luna/Atchley): To postpone this item to a date in the future. Motion carried unanimously. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES Section I - Human Resources 1. Proposed Amendments to Boar d Policy - Sections II.B.2; II.F.1 -2; II.G.1; II.N. - First Reading M/S (Westerberg/Edmunds): To approve the first reading of the proposed amendments to Board Policies II.B.2; II.F.1 and 2; II.G.1; and II.N. as submitted. Motion carried unanimously. Representatives from the institutions were invited to comment on the policy revisions. Joni Mina, representing the faculty at Lewis -Clark State College, reported that LCSC's faculty wholeheartedly opposes the policy revisions being proposed today. She observed that these revisions give permission to administrators to change contracts without due process and give administrators unfettered, unaccountable power. She suggested that essentially the language found in the financial exigency policy was simply plac ed into general policy. Ms. Mina pointed out that allowing administrators to change contracts in midstream, separate from financial exigency, will damage Idaho's higher education system by negatively impacting the retention and recruitment of faculty. Ms . Mini urged the Board to not approve these revised policies. She also suggested that if the policies do need to be changed, a collaborative effort and process should be undertaken that includes faculty, staff, and public scrutiny and input. Alan Frantz, representing the faculty of Idaho State University, reported that ISU's faculty opposes the proposed policies because it renders contracts useless and undermines tenure. Dr. Frantz indicated that the resolution prepared by ISU's faculty states strong opp osition to extending financial exigency authority to situations that are outside of financial exigency situations. He noted that ISU's faculty also recommended that there be a clearer definition of the entry point and exit point for when a financial chall enge begins and ends. ISU faculty also recommend including language that allows each institution to draft language as to how a financial challenge will be managed. Owen McDougal, representing the faculty of Boise State University, noted BSU faculty and staff expressed tremendous concern about the policy changes, and even more as to how the policy changes came about. BSU's Faculty Senate has approved the concept of participating in the Boardwork February 18, 2010 BOARDWORK 11 process of drafting changes to policy. Professor McDougal spoke about concerns related to the guarantee of salary in respect to tenure. The faculty of BSU requests the Board to seek an opinion from Idaho's Attorney General on the connection between tenure and salary. He noted that the faculty in the state of Idaho would welcome the opportunity to collectively participate in the drafting of policy and the revision of the current policy with faculty concerns being addressed. John Miller, of the University of Idaho, urged the Board to understand the gravity of the present situation. He observed that the University's faculty is regularly advised of budget situations and they understand the seriousness of this present situation. He urged the Board to address the problem on the revenue side and not just the cost -cutting side. He touched on concerns related to temporary furloughs. Mr. Miller spoke about the language related to base salary reductions, and emphasized the point that permanent salary reductions should not be part of this policy. He discussed the importance, for t he sake of recruitment and retention, to be able to offer a salary and guarantee it. Mr. Miller also spoke about the general provision that grants authority to the president to take various forms of action related to personnel, and noted that the president should not be given plenary power to make salary reductions. He pointed out that what is missing in the Board policy is the option for the employee to challenge the president's actions if it is in violation of the employee's rights. Mr. Miller observed , with respect to the provisions to the salary reductions, that those provisions imply that a president may choose to give any particular employee or group of employees a reduced salary in the coming year. He reiterated that permanent base salary reductions have no place in this policy. Mr. Miller pointed to several other places in the policy revisions that were not logical and suggested that they either be removed or clarified. Board member Westerberg thanked the panelists for their input. He noted that the Board is up against the financial situation. He then invited the legal counsels from the institutions forward to comment. Kent Nelson of the University of Idaho noted that this has been an engaged process. He also noted that all of the institutions have great and hard working faculty. Board member Westerberg reminded the Board that this is a first reading of the policy. If it is approved on first reading there is opportunity to clarify the language and make non- substantive changes. In terms of d rafting issues, Kevin Satterlee of Boise State University agreed with Mr. Miller that some of the policies need to be clarified and adjusted. In terms of the tenure and salary issues, Mr. Satterlee agreed are there legal issues to be address. Mr. Nelson and Mr. Satterlee agreed that the Attorney General's opinion should be sought. They agreed that there is not good case law on this subject and no clear answer as to whether tenure protects year -to-year salary. Mr. Satterlee observed that if a salary is r educed so much that it appears tantamount to dismissal then it is a problem. He noted again that there is no clear authority on this and a ruling from the Attorney General would be advisable. Section II - Finance 1. Amendment to Board Policy Section I.

Board President Agidius asked the institutions to forward the detai ls to the Board about what they have under the category of \"Other\" that appears in the list of sources. Board member Westerberg reiterated that he would like to know the amount of money the institutions get in research and development grants. 3. Am endment to Board Policy Section V.W. - First Reading M/S (Westerberg/Soltman): To approve the first reading of Board Policy V.W. - Litigation, as submitted. Motion carried unanimously.

Motion carried unanimously. Board member Westerberg introduced this item and explained that this action waives, for one year only, the need for institutions to give prior notice to the Board if they plan to request a f ee increase greater than 10%. It is a result of the current financial crisis and the uncertainties yet to come. Board President Agidius noted that approval of this motion does not mean that the Board will approve fee increases. Separate from this motion, Board member Westerberg suggested that there is a need to review this policy. Board President Agidius questioned whether the policy was necessary because it is redundant and micromanages the institutions. There were no objections from other Board member s to that point. Board member Westerberg then requested that Board staff to start the process to have this policy removed from Board policy, and to come forward with that action at the next Board meeting. Boardwork February 18, 2010 BOARDWORK 13 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 1. Superintendent's Update State Superintendent Luna discussed the Department's efforts to apply for \"Race to the Top\" grant funds. A handout was provided to the Board as Mr. Luna made his formal presentation. Mr. Luna explained the purpose of the funds and Idaho's vision for using the funds. He described Idaho's process in putting together the grant application. He noted that informational meetings are being held throughout the state through the month of December. Idaho's \"Race to the Top\" committee will meet after the information meetings have been conducted in order to review input and finalize the application. MOU's will be made available to districts on December 21, 2009. Interested districts need to submit signed MOU's by January 12, 2010. The final application is due by January 19, 2010 and the first round of awards comes out in April 2010. States not receiving awards can reapply in June 2010. Mr. Luna reported that Idaho's grant application is based on two major criteria: first, what Idaho has already done, and second, what Idaho still wants to accomplish. Mr. Luna reviewed the selection criteria and Idaho's priorities related to the grant. Those priorities include: improved standards and assessments; more robust data systems; focused and in- depth professional development for teachers and principals; incentives for teachers and principals; enhanced school improvement efforts; college and career readiness starting in the middle grades; and, dual credit opportunities for juniors and seniors. Mr. Luna reported that that the Department has a website for the public to access more information and provide feedback. He indicated that the Department is holding a webinar next week to allow schools across the state to listen to the presentation and ask questions. They c an then meet to decide whether or not to sign the MOU. It will take a lot of effort on the local district level to take action on this, but Idaho has to adhere to the strict timelines it has been given. Mr. Luna indicated that the Board President will need to sign the final grant application. The Board agreed to hold a separate meeting at a later date to address that issue. 2. Idaho Math Initiative Presentation Cindy Johnstone of the Department presented to the Board on the Idaho Math Initiative, which is in its second year. Ms. Johnstone reported that the focus of the Math Initiative is student achievement, teacher education, and public awareness. The professional development class focuses on student thinking. It is estimated that by the end of y ear two, over 4,000 educators will have taken that class. Ms. Johnstone noted that regional math specialists have been hired to provide continued support. Currently the Department looks at the ISAT data to see if the math initiative has made a differenc e. Other ways to make that determination include classroom observation by the regional specialists, teacher inventories conducted by teachers of their students, and the use of an outside evaluator. In addition, a pre- assessment and post -assessment tool w ill be used. Ms. Johnstone discussed student successes using the intervention math tool called Apangea Learning. There have been significant increases in its use and the completion of its activities by students over the last two years. Other efforts f unded by the Math Initiative are the Family Math Night kits and the Primary Math Assessment. Boardwork February 18, 2010 BOARDWORK 14 In terms of how this will fit with other science and math initiatives, Ms. Johnstone indicated that this methodology can be rolled into the various science, tec hnology, and math initiatives. It is being explored by those groups. Mr. Luna explained that the Apangea program is available to students who excel as well as those who struggle. On another note, as part of the math initiative, Idaho will have 44 students attending the Space Academy at a NASA facility in California. Mr. Luna indicated that there is a coordinated effort statewide in K -12 to make sure students and parents are aware of the math and science opportunities in Idaho. Many students have take n advantage of those opportunities. Board member Edmunds suggested that the Board come up with a comprehensive approach to communicate the various activities, and to engage the business community even more. 3. Accountability Workbook M/S (Luna/Edmunds) : To adopt the Idaho Consolidated State Application Accountability Workbook as submitted. Motion carried unanimously. 4. Idaho Special Education Manual M/S (Luna/Edmunds): To adopt the changes to the Idaho Special Education Manual as submitted. Motion carried unanimously. OTHER BUSINESS There being no further business, a motion to adjourn was entertained. M/S (Westerberg/Luna): To adjourn the meeting at 3:12 p.m. Motion carried unanimously. Boardwork February 18, 2010 BOARDWORK 15 STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TRUSTEES OF BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES OF IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES OF LEWIS -CLARK STATE COLLEGE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO STATE BOARD FOR PROFESSIONAL -TECHNICAL EDUCATION TRUSTEES FOR THE IDAHO SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF AND THE BLIND DRAFT MINUTES STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION SPECIAL TELECONFERENCE MEETING January 15, 2010 650 W. State Street Office of the State Board of Education Boise, Idaho A special teleconference meeting of the State Board of Education was held January 15, 2010. It originated from the Offi ce of the State Board of Education in Boise, Idaho. The meeting was called to order at 11:00 a.m. with a roll -call of members. Board President Paul Agidius presided. Present: Paul Agidius, President Richard Westerberg, Vice President Ken Edmunds, Secret ary Milford Terrell Don Soltman Emma Atchley Tom Luna, State Superintendent Absent: Rod Lewis BOARDWORK Federal Race to the Top Grant M/S (Terrell/Westerberg) To support the submission of Idaho's Race to the Top Grant and to authorize the Board presi dent to sign the application on behalf of the State Board of Education. Roll call vote taken; motion carried unanimously. Mr. Luna reviewed the information he provided in a previous regular Board meeting regarding the Race to the Top Grant. He reviewed w here the grant money comes from, how it can be spent, and what areas need to be focused on in order to make our application competitive. SDE received additional information 1/14/2010 from the U.S. Department of Education regarding the signature requirements for the grant. The application due date is Tuesday, January 19, 2010. There are 60 school districts and 20 charter schools that have signed MOUs to participate. One district's MOU is in question regarding signatures. SDE is pleased with the level of participation. Idaho's application request is for approximately $120 million over four years. The state currently receives over $400 million annually from U.S. Department of Education for K -12 schools in Idaho. Boardwork February 18, 2010 BOARDWORK 16 The grant request is approximately a 10% increase over a four year period of time. The focus of this application is standards, assessments, data systems, pay for performance for teachers, and higher level of accountability. Mr. Edmunds asked what percentage of the student population in Idaho t he grant includes. Mr. Luna indicated about 40%. The grant attracted more rural districts than larger, urban districts. Mr. Edmunds asked about the timing of the approval for the grant application, and whether it is better to wait until June to provide an improved application or to continue and apply now? Mr. Luna answered that he is confident that the grant is of the quality to move forward today. He said it is important to participate in this first round so that, if Idaho is not awarded the grant i n the first round, it has the opportunity to apply reviewer feedback and then reapply in June. Mr. Luna indicated there is about a 50- 50 chance of receiving the grant. Mr. Terrell commented that Secretary Duncan and this administration are taking a large stance on education and the opportunity of choice for kids. Mr. Terrell asked if applying for and accepting the grant, would there be strings attached that would overpower their authority? Mr. Luna stated that there is nothing in the requirements of the grant that are in conflict with the SBOE goals for education in Idaho, short term or long term. Mr. Terrell followed up by stating that this federal administration is interested in pay for performance. Throughout the nation, it has been a political football. It supports where this Board has been headed over the last few years. He asked if Mr. Luna thinks this is going to make it easier to press the issue of pay for performance. Mr. Luna answered that it already has. Pay for performance has become a bipartisan issue. The Idaho Teachers Association helped put the application together, and they support this plan. Those in the past who have opposed pay for performance are now deciding that it is inevitable and that they should be involved. Over $50 m illion of the grant will end up going to Idaho teachers. Mr. Agidius stated that districts have the option to opt out in the first 30- day period, and asked if the application required all the signer's signatures to opt out? Mr. Luna indicated that it does not. He explained the 90- day process involved in response to Mr. Agidius's question. Mr. Agidius followed up by asking what the major reason was that other districts did not participate. Mr. Luna answered that the one district not participating was not able to get all three signatories to sign. That district's biggest concern was pay for performance. Another concern was sustainability. Under this grant, funding for ongoing programs will not be sustainable, including pay for performance. Mr. Edmun ds asked if Idaho would be implementing policy changes, including revisions in high school and college requirements. Mr. Luna stated that there is nothing that requires us to change high school graduation requirements. Over time, we do need to raise our standards for graduation, but it is not a requirement of the grant. Mr. Luna indicated that we are continually looking to raise high school graduation expectations, that could mean a number of things, but it does not require us to change our high school graduation requirements. Before the Race to the Top Grant was being discussed, Idaho agreed to discuss common core standards with 46 other states. Those would be state -developed, and states would choose to participate or not, and they would be internationally benchmarked. Idaho would do this with or without the grant. Mr. Edmunds indicated he was in favor of that. Dr. Rush stated that we pulled up the minutes on this topic and it was presented as an information item because Mr. Luna stated that the coll aborative group of states got together and formulated the standards, but the Board would have to then approve those. Mr. Luna stated that it does not obligate the Board to adopt them. Boardwork February 18, 2010 BOARDWORK 17 Mr. Edmunds commented on summative assessments. If Idaho cannot use grant money to do that, how would we go about getting that funding. Mr. Luna confirmed that SDE cannot use Race to the Top funds for summative assessments and is not planning to use state funds for this. There is a separate federal grant that will be us ed for summative assessments. Carissa Miller was invited to the table to explain those grants. Mr. Edmunds asked if the SLDS grant and the Race to the Top Grant conflicted in any way. Mr. Luna answered that in order to hit every point necessary in the Race to the Top Grant; SDE had to explain how to deliver on the SLDS currently under construction in Idaho. SDE discussed this with the U.S. Department of Education who assured SDE that including that in the application would not be duplicative. Mr. Edm unds asked what policy revisions are being implied by approval of the grant. Mr. Luna indicated he did not know of any policy implications, and that discussions had taken place regarding the possibility of some Board action in moving toward common core st andards. Mr. Luna further indicated that pay for performance and SLDS would not require policy changes and there is nothing in state law or Board policy requiring approval to implement these changes. Some districts are already doing pay for performance. Mr. Agidius asked if the Board needs to sign off on any of the districts' plans. Mr. Luna answered that, no, the local boards will need to do that. Mr. Edmunds asked if it would be detrimental for pilot programs starting and then ending at the end of the grant. Mr. Luna answered that the only one that is detrimental is pay for performance. This will answer the question whether pay for performance is successful or not. This will provide data to answer the question of whether pay for performance makes a difference in student achievement. Ms. Atchley asked what activities or incentives will come out of the grant that will be available to the districts who did not sign MOUs to participate in the Race to the Top Grant, would there be positive outcomes fr om the grant that can be adopted statewide? Mr. Luna answered in the affirmative and that there are a lot of things SDE desires to implement whether the grant is awarded or not. He further indicated that formative assessment, Program for International St udent Assessment (PISA), funding for 11 th grade ACT, SLDS, all these will be statewide and will benefit all districts whether participating in Race to the Top Grant or not. These things will be one -time expenditures and we will benefit from those for many years. ACT funding will not be funded beyond the grant, nor will pay for performance, professional development, etc. Ms. Atchley indicated that the grant appears as a positive activity. Mr. Luna also added that all participating districts will allow ju niors and seniors to take six college credits each year through dual credit. Mr. Luna thanked the Board for reviewing the application and asking very informed questions. Dr. Rush introduced Roger Brown, Policy Advisor for education in the Governor's offi ce. Dr. Rush also stated that several MOUs have been signed by himself on behalf of the Board. Those will need to be approved by the Board at the February Board meeting. Mr. Edmunds stated that IBCEE recommendations have not been approved by the Board. M/S (Terrell/Atchley): To adjourn this special meeting of the Board at 11:51 a.m. Motion carried unanimously.

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Responsibility, management, control and r eporting requirements for Athletics are detailed in board policy. The four public higher education institutions are required to submit regular financial reports as specified by the Board office. The revenue and expenditures reported must reconcile to the NCAA Agreed Upon Procedures Reports that are prepared an nually and reviewed by the external auditors. Board policy establishes limits on the amoun t of general account and institutional funds an institution can allocate to athl etics. These limits are adjusted annually at the same rate of change as the general education appropriation. Increases to the student activity fee supporting athletics are limited to the ra te of increase for the total student activity fees. There is no limit on program funds. Appropriated funds above the limit can be alloca ted for additional women's programs, addressing gender equity issues. The Gender Equity reports were last provided to the Board three years ago. Title IX of the Education Amendm ents of 1972 is the federal legislation that bans sex discrimination in schools, whether it is in academics or athletics. Title IX states: \"No person in the U.S. sha ll, on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in, or denied the be nefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activi ty receiving federal aid.\" In regard to intercollegiate athletics, the US Departmen t of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a Clarification of Inter collegiate Athletics Polic y Guidance: The Three-Part Test in 1996 to analyze if an institution is in compliance: First , financial assistance must be substant ially proportionate to the ratio of male and female athletes. Second, the selection of sports and the le vel of competition must accommodate the students' interests and abilities using the three factors listed below: 1. Participation opportunities for male and female student s are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their re spective enrollments. 2. Where the members of one sex have been and are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, whether the institution can show a history and continuing practice of program expansion wh ich is demonstrably responsive to the developing intere sts and abilities of that sex. CONSENT AGENDA FEBRUARY 18, 2010 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 6 Page 2 3. Where the members of one sex are underrepr esented among intercollegiate athletes and the in stitution cannot show a continuing practice of program expa nsion, whether it can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program. Third , all other benefits, opportunities , and treatments afforded sports participants are to be equivalent, but not necessarily identical including equipment and supplies, scheduling games and practices, travel expenses, availability and compensation of coaches, q uality of facilities, medical services, housing, dining, and recruitment. Appraisal of compliance is on a program-wide basis , not on a sport-by-sport basis. IMPACT The Athletics Reports present the financial status of the interc ollegiate athletic programs and the participat ion of students in the various sport programs. The Gender Equity Reports show an origin al base year of 1999, the current 2005 base year, and the number of years needed to attain equity. The reports also show the breakdown by gender of full-time students, athletes, and the annual student athlete aid. Finally , the gender equity reports show the participants by sport for both men's and women's prog rams which show the addition or elimination of any programs.

PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS FEBRUARY 18, 2010 PPGA TAB 7 Page 1 SUBJECT Appointment of District Supervisor APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Section 33-909, Idaho Code. BACKGROUND/ DISCUSSION In 2006 Section 33- 909, Idaho C ode established the Public School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program. The intent of the program is to: 1) provide an ongoing means of providing funds for the purpose of assisting school districts to fund repair and replacement of unsafe school facilities; 2) establish an ongoi ng School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program wher eby the state initially funds the total cost of repair and replacement that school districts are unable to fund themselves ; and 3) establish within the Office of the State Board of Education the Idaho Public School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program panel. The panel consists of the administrator of the Division of Building Safety, the Division of Public Works , and the Executive Director for the State Board of Education. The panel is assigned the dut y of considering all applications made to the fund and to either approve, modify , or reject an application based on the most economical solution to the problem (as analyzed over a projected twenty (20) year time frame). Applications may be submitted to t he panel by any school district that has failed to approve at least one (1) or more bond levies for the repair, renovation, or replacement of an existing unsafe facility within the two years preceding submission of the application; or by the administrator of the Division of Building Safety for a school district that has failed to address identified unsafe facilities as provided in chapter 80, title 39, Idaho Code. Once the panel approves the application, the community is given another opportunity to approve a bond. If this bond fails, then the provisions for state funding of the local building are implemented including the State Board of Education appointing a district supervisor to supervise the entire project. The Plummer -Worley School District #44 (PWS D) submitted an application to replace the Lakeside Elementary School due to imminent safety hazards. The District had run three failed bond elections within a two- year period. The panel found that the District had indeed met the conditions specified in I daho Code for the fund and unanimously approved the application submitted by the District with some modifications. The amount approved by the Panel was $11,349,435. The District then held a fourth bond election for that amount , which failed. Consequently, the panel met February 12, 2010, to certify the results of the bond election and discuss the selection of a District Supervisor to be recommended to the Board.

I have known Dave as both a friend and a partner in our firm, MGT of America, Inc. He was one of three national leaders in our educational facility practice area. Other divisions within our firm also utilized his professional skills. Dave's experience and expertise in educational finance and educational leadership contributed to our success in those service areas as well. With his great work ethic and professional skills, he has excelled in all these positions. Dave's human relations skills are excellent. He relates well to people in general. In difficult situations that would tax the patience of most individuals, his confident and calm manner brought stability. He holds his subordinates accountable through a clear sense of vision and frequent communication. Many co-workers have described his problem- solving and conflict resolution skills as \"mature.\" His sense of humor also brings balance and a sense of perspective to those around him. During these times of great change in education, Dave has taken on the responsibility of staying current in the field of educational facility planning and management. His technical skills in the many aspects of planning (demographics, utilization, space programming, and facility assessment) are exemplary. He sees the interconnectedness of all levels of education. On a national level, Dave has been our corporate \"go to guy\" in the area of career technical education facilities. His understanding of career technical education programs and the facilities that support those programs is unique in the facility planning community. He has lead teams of educators, business partners, and patrons through complex processes and provided a \"cool head\" when difficult issues arose. With such a broad range of professional knowledge and his interpersonal skills, he provides the necessary leadership to his fellow educators and to the community as a whole. Dave also sees the \"bigger picture\" in public schools and higher education. He clearly comprehends the interconnectedness of education, businesses, and the larger communities in which he serves. Assessment and accountability are important issues to him. When working on complex issues with considerable detail, he is able to keep a sense of direction about the main concepts and tasks. He stays focused. PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFIARS PPGA TAB 7 Page 19 FEBRUARY 18, 2010April 1, 2008 Page 2 Dave has a sense of mission and genuine love of people. Here at MGT, we felt a sense of loss by his semi-retirement. However, we are comforted by the knowledge that Dave Teater will be an advocate for education regardless of wherever he goes. He is among the few with the broad range of skills to be a \"leader of leaders\" and I could not recommend him more highly for any educational facility planning position. Sincerely, Fred Forrer President/Chief Executive Officer PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFIARS PPGA TAB 7 Page 20 FEBRUARY 18, 2010 March 28, 2008 RE: Recommendation for Mr. Dave Teater To Whom It May Concern: It is with great pride and honor that I write this letter of recommendation for Mr. Dave Teater. I have nothing but the highest remarks for Dave as he has been our representative for several construction projects. Dave has demonstrated his vast knowledge on several projects from the preplanning stages of conceptual design through the actual construction phase. His unique ability to listen and draw out thoughts based upon true need has saved my district several thousands of dollars. His basic understanding of what it takes to build classrooms that will service the district's instructional needs as well as developing a true learning environment has been a huge bonus for both our teachers and administrators. I truly appreciate his astute fiscal practices that allows for such action to be planned, constructed, and finally implemented in our school system. A classic example of Dave's expertise and leadership has been his challenge to various departments to look into the future and have a vision of what really is valued and what should be considered. In our last project, Dave challenged our traditional vocational department to think nontraditional and look into the world of career centers and technical education. As such, we are currently looking into education pathways that help students explore interests in a variety of career opportunities throughout our school day. We do have the Running Start Program connection with Flathead Valley Community College. Due the exploration our vocational department is under taking, renewed interest allows us to use FVCC programs and other local businesses for career and technical education. Dave Teater is responsible for that planning and goal setting. My final comment in the way of a recommendation is the fact that Dave has outstanding compassion for learning and student achievement. He knows the global education expectations and he is well prepared to be excellent counsel for transforming school systems into true learning centers for today and for tomorrow's students. If you do choose his counsel, you and your community will be greatly treated to a professional who understands your needs and allows you to make decisions that will be effective far into the future. Sincerely, Jerry House Superintendent PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFIARS PPGA TAB 7 Page 21 FEBRUARY 18, 2010 February 11, 2010 To whom it may concern: On behalf of all of us at Architects West, I'd like to highly recommend Dave Teater as an educational consultant. We have worked closely with Dave for over 12 years. During that time he has provided many school facility planning services for our clients. His career as an educator and his national experience as a consultant provide a perspective that is an advantage for both our firm and the school districts we serve. Dave has a broad understanding of school programs, curriculum, instruction, administration, and governance. This allows him to connect quickly with the issues and build trust with school personnel and community patrons. His understanding of education and focus on students helps him work with a broad range of stakeholders in every project. This deep appreciation of the mission of schools also is behind his belief that the school programs \"drive\" school plans and designs. His ability to see the \"big picture\" with a school district makes him an excellent school facility master planner. His ability to understand how schools work makes his educational specifications a very practical resource for schools and architects. As a school facility planner, he has that rare ability to speak the languages of both educators and design professionals. Dave's successful background as a counselor and school administrator serve him well when working with the many personalities and interest groups in schools. He is a good communicator, listens well, and has the conflict resolution skills to work with even the most contentious groups. If you have any additional questions about Dave, I w ould be happy to discuss them with you. I can be reached at 208-667-9402. Sincerely, ARCHITECTS WEST, INC.

I had the pleasure of working with Dave T eater for over a year as the Selland College of Applied Technology at Boise St ate University was transitioning to the College of Western Idaho. Dave was brought in as a consultant to study the current space of each Professional Technical Education program and develop a comprehensive analysis of each program's future space needs based on current and projected enrollments. At the time , there were 33 programs - a daunting task! The process began with much apprehension and suspicion on the part of the faculty. Nothing is more important to a Professional Technica l program that the lab area and they do not readily trust that anyone but themselves know what is best. Dave handled this apprehension very well. He was calm and open. The faculty were very pleased to have someone listen to their needs and incorporate their expert opinions into the plans. The process ended with excitement and trust. The document that Dave created, translati ng future needs for the programs, has been invaluable to the planning at CWI with detailed specifications that are being used to determine building design and redesign. It is giving us solid information to help make decisions. Please feel free to contact me regardi ng Dave. I can be reached at (208) 562- 2505 (my work number at the College of Western Idaho).

The first Race to the Top grant, which was submitted in January 2010, includes a provision in section B2 \"Developing and implement ing common, high-quality assessments\" that states: \"The extent to which the State has demo nstrated its commitment to improving the quality of its assessments, evidenced by (as set forth in Appendix B) the State's participation in a consor tium of States that\u2014 (i) Is working toward jointly developing and implementing common, high-quality assessments (as defined in this notice) aligned with the consortium's common set of K-12 standards (as defined in this notice); and (ii) Includes a significant number of States.\" The MOSAIC consortium meets these specific requirements of this first Race to the Top grant criteria. In addition, the Race to the Top grant appl ication submitted in January also asks states to submit \"documentation that the State' s consortium has applied, or intends to apply, for a grant through the separate Race to the Top Assessment Program (to be described in a subsequent notice).\" The SMARTER consortium is designed to develop summative assessment s (like the ISAT) in conjunction with other states and to apply for the Race to the Top Assessment grant due out in March 2010 with an award in June 2010. The SMARTER consortium will use a computer, online adaptive test envir onment to deliver the summative assessments and will be tied to the MOSAI C consortium so that there is a seamless transition from formative to summative assessments. Idaho was presented with multiple MOUs and offered the opportunity to participate with other states in other efforts. These two specific activities were chosen because they most closely alig n with Idaho's efforts in online and adaptive assessments. IMPACT Idaho does not have a formative assessment tool in place on a statewide basis. Participation in the MOSAIC consortium will provide Idaho with a comprehensive computerized formative assessment system. It will provide better tools to SDE TAB 2 Page 1 STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FEBRUARY 18, 2010 teachers to periodically diagnose and addre ss student learning deficiencies prior to the year end summative assessment. The financial impact will be absorbed in the Race to t he Top grant award if Idaho is awarded the grant. Afte r the four years of the grant, Idaho would have access to a system created through t he grant funds but would need to either find funding to continue the assessment, or find another delivery method for the formative assessments such as the Instructional Improvement System/Learning Management System at SDE. The cost to maintain this system afte r the four years of the grant has been estimated at $5 per student per year (unlimited usage) for a total cost to Idaho of approximately $1,375,000 for 27 5,000 students in grades K-12. However, as the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) has not been released the actual cost has not been determined. Participation in the SMAR TER consortium would allo w Idaho to use a grant to build new summative assessments, whic h will be a requisite with the adoption of the new Common Core Standards. This consortium would also allow for the sharing of an item bank that includes bot h multiple choice items as well as performance items like the Direct Math Assessment (DMA) or Direct Writing Assessment (DWA). At the end of the grant, Idaho woul d be in the position to continue on in the consortium and utilize the new assessment as the replacement for the ISAT in Reading and Mathematics to meet the No Child Left Behind federal requirements. Funding for th ese assessments could be paid in the same way the ISAT is paid currently, with a combination of federal and state assessment dollars. The SMAR TER proposal is a system built by using teachers' expertise in item writing and the propos al suggests use of open source software for delivery of the system, thus making a conscious effort to reduce costs. However, as with the MOSAIC consortium, the RFP has not been released and total costs have not yet been determined. Should Idaho adopt the Common Core Standards in Reading and Mathematics, it will necessitate changes in the summa tive assessments (ISAT) Idaho delivers. Participation in a consortia and the use of grant funds to develop the system with the components Idaho desires has the benefit of actual cost savings. In addition, the participation in a consortium allows for nationwide collaboration with experts in multiple areas of asse ssment.

Unfortunately, prominent foundations, institutes and \"think tanks\" have used state test and NAEP results inappropriately to define rigor and to compare state performance standards in order to promote this discussion. The National Cent er for Education Statistics conducted this research study to establish a way for using NA EP as a common yardstick to provide a context for understanding the ri gor of state tests. NAEP's Basic cut-score is an estimate of grade- level performance or proficiency in the subject, using the common meaning of \"proficiency.\" The mapping study rated the rigor of the I SAT reading tests for both the fourth and eighth grades below the NAEP Basic cut-score. Idaho's profici ency standards for the ISAT mathematics tests for the fourth and eighth grades we re rated above the NAEP Basic cut-score. There is little correlation between the rigor of a state's test and the overall achievement of students in the state. The rigor ratings for the ISAT reading test, for example, were below the NAEP Basic cut-score in both grades four and eight. Idaho fourth and eighth grade students, however, earned average scale scores on the NAEP reading test that were above the NAEP Basic cut-score.

SDE TAB 4 Page 1 STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FEBRUARY 18, 2010 SDE TAB 4 Page 2 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK The 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) measured various injury-related behaviors including helmet use while riding a bike, seatbelt use, drinking and driving, weapon carrying, violence, bullying, and suicide. Although many of the 2009 Idaho YRBS measurements relating to injury prevention did not changesignificantly, there was a significant decrease in the percentof students who rode in a car with someone who had beendrinking during the previous 30 days (chart 1). There wasvery little change in the percent of students who were in aphysical fight (chart 2) or the percentage of students whohave ever been forced to have sexual intercourse when theydidn't want to (chart 3). When it comes to seatbelt and helmet use, 9% of Idaho students never or rarely wore a seatbelt, and 85% ofIdaho students who rode a bike in the previous year never or rarely wore abicycle helmet.Drinking anddriving is also anissue for Idahostudents. Justunder one-in-fourIdaho high school students rode in a car driven by someone who had beendrinking alcohol, and 10% of students drove a car after theyhad been drinking alcohol. Violence and the threat of violence are issues thatUnintentional and Intentional Injury2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey Chart 1: Percent of Idaho students who in the previous 30 days rode in a car with a driver who had been drinking alcohol (2001-2009 Idaho YRBS) 100% 29%24%28%30% 22% 100% 2001 2003 2007 200980% 60%40%20% 0%29% 28%32% 30% 29% Chart 3: Percent of Idaho students who have ever been forced to have sexual intercourse when they didn't want to (2001-2009 Idaho YRBS) 100% 80% 60%40%20% 0%Chart 2: Percent of Idaho students who were in a physical fight one or more times during the past 12months (2001-2009 Idaho YRBS) 8% 10% 9% 11% 10% The following questions can be used to start a conversation in the schoolcommunity about ways to prevent injuryamong the student population. 1) How do these rates compare with what we seeamong our own students? 2) Is maintaining a safe physical environment an issue in our school or district? 3) Is violence a big discipline issue in our school or district? 4) How can we improve our behavioral health services for students? 5) Do injury and violence interfere with attendance and students' ability to learn? 6) Do we have the resources to identify and assist students who are struggling with mental healthand/or depression which may lead to suicide? 7) Do we have a written crisis response plan?8) What are our goals around injury prevention and how can we achieve them?2009 YRBS Results Unintentional and Intentional Injury Among Idaho students ... Bike Helmet Use 85% never or rarely wore a bike helmet when riding a bike during the previous 12 months. Seatbelt Use 9% never or rarely wear a seatbelt when riding in acar driven by someone else. Drinking and Driving 10% drove a car one or more times during theprevious 30 days when they had been drinkingalcohol. Weapon Carrying 22% carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or clubduring the previous 30 days. 8% had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property one or more times during theprevious 12 months. Violence 11% were hit, slapped, or physically hurt on purposeby their boyfriend or girlfriend during the previous 12months. 10% have been physically forced to have sexual intercourse when they did not want to do so. Suicide 28% felt so sad or hopeless almost every day for twoweeks or more in a row that they stopped doingsome usual activities during the previous 12 months. 13% made a plan about how they would attempt suicide during the previous 12 months. 7% attempted suicide during the previous 12 months.

In particular, 8% of Idaho students had been threatened orinjured with a weapon on school property, and 22% ofstudents carried a weapon during the previous year.Intimate partner violence and sexual assault are alsomeasured by the Idaho YRBS. Among Idaho students,11% were hit, slapped, or physically hurt by theirboyfriend or girlfriend during the past year, while 10%have been forced to have sex when they did not wantto. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth aged 15 to 19 in Idaho. Just over one inten (13%) of students made a plan about how theywould attempt suicide, and 7% reported actuallyattempting suicide during the previous year.Tobacco Use2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey Chart 1: Percent of Idaho students who have ever tried cigarette smoking, even one or two puffs (2001-2009 Idaho YRBS) 100% 80% 60%40%20% 0% Chart 2: Percent of Idaho students who smoked a cigarette on one or more of the previous 30 days (2001-2009 Idaho YRBS) 100% 80% 60%40%20% 0% Chart 3: Percent of Idaho students who used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip on one or more of the previous30 days (2001-2009 Idaho YRBS) 100% 80% 60%40%20% 0%Tobacco use is considered the leading preventable cause of death in the United States with an estimated 18% of all deaths attributed to tobacco use. If current patterns of smoking behavior persist, an estimated 24,000 Idaho youth are projected to dieprematurely from smoking-related illnesses. Tobacco use questions in the 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) measured smokingexperimentation, current smoking patterns, age of initiation,smoking on school property and attempts to quit smoking.In addition to questions about cigarette smoking, the YRBS includes measures associatedwith other forms of tobacco usesuch as chew and cigars. Although the proportion of students who have ever triedsmoking decreased in 2009,40% of students have smokedat least one cigarette duringtheir lifetime (chart 1). On apositive note, current smoking (defined as having smoked on one or more of the previous30 days) prevalence among Idaho teens decreasedsubstantially from 20% in 2007 to 15% in 2009 (chart 2). The use of chewing tobacco increased significantly from 6% in 2003 to 12% in 2007. In 2009, 9% of studentsused chewing tobacco on one or more of the previous 30days. While chewing tobacco is predominately used bymale students (15% of male students used chewing tobaccoin the previous 30 days), 3% of female students also used2001 2003 2005 2007 200954% 43%45%48% 40% 2001 2003 2005 200919% 14%16%20%15% 2001 2003 2005 2007 20098%6%9% 12% 9% The following questions can be used to start a conversation in the schoolcommunity about ways to preventtobacco use among the studentpopulation. 1) How do these rates compare with what we seeamong our own students? 2) Is tobacco use a key discipline or attendance issue in our school or district? 3) How strong are our tobacco use policies? Are these policies properly implemented, enforced, andcommunicated to the school community? 4) How can we better educate our students and staff on tobacco use, prevention, and cessation? 5) Do we take part in tobacco prevention events, such as Kick Butts Day or the Great American Smokeout? 6) How can we improve our tobacco cessation services to students and staff? 7) How can we better educate families about tobacco use and inform them about community resourcesaround prevention and cessation? 8) What are out goals around tobacco use and how can we achieve them?2009 YRBS Results Tobacco Use Among Idaho students ... Ever Tried Smoking 40% have tried cigarette smoking, even one or two puffs, at least once during their lifetime Age of Initiation 9% smoked a whole cigarette for the first time beforeage 13 Current Smoking (Current smoking is defined as having smokedcigarettes on one or more of the previous 30 days) 15% are current smokers with no difference between the smoking rate among male and female students 4% smoked cigarettes on school property during the previous 30 days Frequent Smoking (Frequent smoking is defined as having smokedcigarettes on 20 or more of the previous 30 days) 4% are considered frequent smokers Youth Access 7% of male students and 1% of female students (under age 18) usually got their own cigarettes bypurchasing them in a store or gas station Smoking Cessation Among students who reported current cigarette use,60% tried to quit smoking at least once during theprevious 12 months Chewing Tobacco 9% used chewing tobacco one or more of theprevious 30 days and 6% of students used chewingtobacco on school property during the previous 30days Cigar Use 12% smoked a cigar, cigarillo, or little cigar on one ormore of the previous 30 days Any Tobacco Use 22% used some form of tobacco during the previous30 days (includes cigarettes, chew, snuff, dip, cigars,cigarillos, or little cigars) For additional information or a full copy of the 2009 Idaho YRBS Report visit www.sde.idaho.gov/site/csh/contact Coordinated School Health at 208.332.6929chewing tobacco in the previous month. Over one-third (40%) of all Idaho students have tried cigarette smoking, and 9% smoked a whole cigarette before age 13. The good news is that amongstudents who reported current cigarette use, over half(60%) have tried to quit in the past year. In addition to cigarettes and chewing tobacco, 12% of students smoked a cigar, and 22% of studentsused some form of tobacco during the previous 30days (includes cigarettes, chew, snuff, dip, cigars,cigarillos, or little cigars).Physical activity helps build and maintain healthy bones and muscles, control weight, build lean muscle, and reduce fat. In adolescence, obesity is associated with hypertension, abnormal glucose tolerance, and adverse psychological and social consequences. The 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) included questions which measured self-reported height andweight, fruit and vegetable consumption, specific weightcontrol behaviors, and participation in physical activity. The percent of students who engaged in the recommended levels of physical activity (60 minutes perday on five or more days a week) increased from 39% in2005 to 63% in 2009 (chart1). Male students (64%) weresignificantly more likely than female students (43%) to be physically active for 60 minutes or more per day at least 5 days a week. Despite sizeable increases in the percent of students who were physically active, the percent of students whowere overweight or obese decreased only slightly from 23%in 2007 to 21% in 2009 (chart 2).

Overweight and Obese 21% are considered to be overweight or obese (i.e. at or above the 85th percentile for BMI, by age andsex) Male students (25%) are much more likely to be overweight or obese than female students (16%) Weight Control 25% of male students and 60% of female studentsreported that they were trying to lose weight (astatistically significant difference) 62% exercised to lose weight or keep from gaining weight during the previous 30 days 38% ate less food, fewer calories, or foods low in fat in order to lose weight or keep from gaining weightduring the previous 30 days Fruit & Vegetable Consumption 70% of students ate a green salad on one or more ofthe previous seven days 19% ate fruits and vegetables five or more times during the previous seven days Nutrition 22% of male students and 14% of female studentsdrank soda pop one or more times per day during theprevious seven days Recommended Physical Activity Male students (64%) were significantly more likelythan female students (43%) to be physically active fora total of at least 60 minutes per day on five or moreof the past seven days 22% watched three or more hours of TV on an average school day Physical Education 24% attend physical education (PE) classes dailyduring an average school week Male students (31%) were significantly more likely than female students (16%) to attend PE classesdaily during an average school week For additional information or a full copy of the 2009 Idaho YRBS Report visit www.sde.idaho.gov/site/csh/contact Coordinated School Health at 208.332.6929increased slightly to 19% (chart 3). Compared to male students, female students are significantly more likely to report trying to lose weight (60%) or to describe themselves as overweight (32%).Female students are also more likely to engage inunhealthy dietary behaviors such as going withouteating for 24 hours to lose weight (14%); using dietpills, powders, or liquids without a doctor's advice(7%); or vomiting or taking laxatives to lose weight(6%).Early sexual activity is associated with unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV , and negative effects on social and psychological development. In Idaho, there were 1,609 out- of-wedlock births and 430 abortions among women aged 15to 19 in 2007. The 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey(YRBS) included sexual behavior questions which measuredthe prevalence of sexual activity, alcohol and/or drug useprior to sexual activity, age at first intercourse, and whetherstudents have received education about HIV or AIDS. 2009 Idaho YRBS results show a slight decrease in the percent of students who reported ever having had sexualintercourse (chart 1). Not surprisingly, 12 thgrade students (48%) were significantly morelikely than 9 thgrade students (25%) to report ever havingsexual intercourse. The earlyinitiation of sexual activity alsodecreased slightly as 4% ofstudents reported they had sexualintercourse for the first timebefore age 13 (chart 2). It has been estimated that at least half of all new HIV infections inthe U.S. are among people under25, and the majority of young people are infected through sexual contact. In Idaho, 86%(chart 3) of all high school students and 89% of 12 thgrade students have received education about HIV or AIDS.

In contrast to lifetime sexual activity, 9thgrade students (6%) were slightly more likely than 12th grade students (3%) to report engaging in early sexual activity (i.e. before age 13) Male students (5%) were slightly more likely than female students (3%) to engage in sexual intercoursefor the first time before age 13 Alcohol and Drug Use Prior to Sexual Activity 8% drank alcohol or used drugs before they hadsexual intercourse the last time 12 thgrade students (8%) were slightly more likely than 9thgrade students (6%) to report alcohol or drug use before the most recent sexual activity AIDS and HIV Education Slightly less than half (48%) say they have talked about AIDS or HIV infection with their own parents orother adults in their family 89% have ever been taught in school about AIDS or HIV infection 9 thgrade students (83%) were slightly less likely than 12thgrade students (86%) to report having been taught in school about AIDS or HIV infection For additional information or a full copy of the 2009 Idaho YRBS Report visit www.sde.idaho.gov/site/csh/contact Coordinated School Health at 208.332.6929Despite the importance of AIDS or HIV infection prevention, under half (48%) of all Idaho students have talked about AIDS or HIV infection withtheir own parents or adult family members. Eight percent of Idaho high school students reported they had used drugs or alcohol before the lasttime they had sexual intercourse.Alcohol use is a major contributing factor in approximately half of all homicides, suicides, and motor vehicle crashes, which are the leading causes of death and disability among young people. Drug abuse is related to suicide, early unwanted pregnancy, school failure,delinquency, and transmission of sexually transmitteddiseases, including HIV . The 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) included questions developed to measure frequency ofalcohol use, age of initiation, heavy drinking, and drinkingon school property. The 2009 Idaho YRBS also includeddrug-related questions which measured the frequency ofcocaine, inhalant (like paint or other aerosols), heroin,ecstacy, methamphetamine, steroid, and injected drug use. Alcohol consumption among students decreased to 34% in 2009 (it's lowest level since 2001). The proportionof students who had their first drink of alcohol before age 13dropped to 19%, the lowest level since 2001.

Ecstacy was the one drug which did not show a drop in use. In 2009, 6% ofIdaho students reported using ecstacy one or moretimes previously in their lifetime. In addition to questions about drug use, the Idaho YRBS asks students if they have been offered,sold, or given an illegal drug by someone on schoolproperty. Among Idaho high school students, 23%report that they have been offered, sold, or given drugsby someone on school property during the previous 12months.Results of the 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey Idaho State Department of EducationRESULTS OF THE 2009 IDAHO YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY Prepared for the Idaho State Department of Education, Tom Luna, State Superintendent of Public Instruction November 2009Page ii 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey ResultsPREFACE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is one component of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in collaboration with representatives from 71 state and local departments of education and health, 19 other federal agencies, and national education and health organizations. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) was designed to focus the nation on behaviors among youth related to the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among both youth and adults and to assess how these risk behaviors change over time. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System primarily measures behaviors that fall into six categories: 1. Behaviors that result in intentional and unintentional injuries and violence2. Tobacco use3. Alcohol and other drug use4. Sexual behaviors that result in HIV infection, other sexually transmitted diseases and unintended pregnancies 5. Weight management and dietary behaviors6. Physical activity In addition to the six behavior categories, the 2009 Idaho YRBS collected information on other health-related information such as asthma, sleeping, sunlight and UV light exposure, and school-based social support and stability. The body of this report highlights the results of the 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey and is intended for use by a broad audience including educators, health program planners, community organizations, youth, parents, legislators, and government agencies. The 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is one component of the surveillance and reporting system for adolescent risk behaviors developed by the Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH), the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The YRBS was rst used in Idaho in 1991. The Idaho Department of Education and State Superintendent Tom Luna acknowledge the participation, support, and cooperation of those persons who made the 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey possible.

Because these objectives are national, not solely federal, the achievement of these objectives is dependent in part on the ability of health agencies at all levels of the government and non-governmental organizations to assess objective progress. This report includes (where appropriate) selected national health objectives for the year 2010 and the corresponding 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey measure. Asterisked measures indicate those years where Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey data show that Idaho has met the HP2010 objective. The following HP2010 objectives are included in the following section of this report: HP 2010 Goal 26-6: Riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol - Reduce the proportion of adolescents who report they rode, during the previous 30 days, with a driver who had been drinking alcohol to 30%HP 2010 Goal 15-39: Carrying a weapon - Reduce weapon carrying by adolescents on school property to 6% HP 2010 Goal 15-38: Physical ghting - Reduce physical ghting among adolescents HP 2010 Goal 18-02: Sadness and suicidal ideation and attempts - Reduce the rate of suicide attempts by adolescentsHP 2010 Goal 27-02b: Cigarette use - Reduce use of cigarettes in the past month by adolescents to 16% HP 2010 Goal 27-02a: Current tobacco use - Reduce use of any tobacco products in the past month by adolescents to 21%HP 2010 Goal 26-11d: Alcohol use - Reduce the proportion of adolescents engaging in binge drinking during the previous 30 daysHP 2010 Goal 26-10b: Marijuana use - Reduce the proportion of adolescents reporting use of marijuana during the previous 30 daysHP 2010 Goal 26-9c: Alcohol use - Increase the proportion of high school seniors who have never used alcohol HP 2010 Goal 26-9d: Illicit drug use - Increase the proportion of high school seniors who have never used Illicit drugs HP 2010 Goal 25-11d: Sexual intercourse - Increase the proportion of adolescents that abstain from ever having sexual intercourseHP 2010 Goal 7-2g: HIV education - Increase the proportion of high schools that provide school health education to prevent unintended pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and STD infectionHP 2010 Goal 19-3: Overweight - Reduce the proportion of overweight or obese (de ned for this HP 2010 objective as being at or above the sex- and age-speci c 95th percentile of BMI) adolescents to 5% HP 2010 Goal 22-9: Physical Education Participation - Increase the proportion of adolescents who participate in daily school physical HP 2010 Goal 22-11: Watching television - Decrease the proportion of adolescents who view television 2 or more hours per day to 25% For further information about Healthy People 2010 visit the website at: www.healthypeople.gov2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey Results Page 1This report describes the results of the 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Idaho's State Department of Education (SDE) conducted the YRBS survey during the Spring 2009 school semester. Similar surveys were conducted in 1991, 1993, 1995, 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007. Mortality, morbidity, and social problems which Idaho teenagers encounter are largely related to a small number of negative behaviors such as drinking and driving, sexual intercourse at a young age, suicide, and lack of seatbelt use, etc. Tobacco use, excessive consumption of fats, and insuf cient physical activity (behaviors formed during adolescence) are known to lead to diseases which are not manifested until adulthood. These behaviors and associated health problems are largely preventable. Survey results for each of the six risk categories (i.e. injury, tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, sexual behaviors, poor diet, and physical inactivity) are presented in four parts: an overview of the risk factor as it applies to Idaho high school students highlights of the 2009 Idaho YRBS results in bullet form graphic illustration of 2009 YRBS key ndings among grades and sexes selected adolescent health objectives for the Year 2010 (Healthy People 2010) For readers desiring additional information, this report includes 2001 to 2009 trends for many of the YRBS measures. The report appendix includes a question-by-question summary of survey results and a copy of the 2009 questionnaire.

The rst- stage sampling frame included all public schools containing any grades 9 through 12. Schools were selected systematically with probability proportional to school enrollment size using a random start. At the second sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or a required period (e.g., second period) were randomly selected using systematic equal probability sampling with a random start. All students in selected classes were eligible to participate in the survey. Data Collection Students completed the self-administered questionnaire in their classrooms during a regular class period, recording their responses directly on a computer-scannable answer sheet. The 2009 Idaho YRBS questionnaire contained 96 multiple-choice questions plus two additional questions to collect student height and weight. Survey procedures were designed to protect students' privacy by allowing for anonymous and voluntary participation. Local parental permission procedures were followed before survey administration. A copy of this survey is included in the appendix of this report or can be obtained from the SDE: (208)332-6929. Data Weighting Based on the sampling methodology, a weight was associated with each student's responses in order to refl ect the likelihood of sampling each student and to reduce bias by compensating for differing patterns of nonresponse. For more information regarding the methodology used to weight the data contact the SDE. The weighted results can be used to make important inferences concerning the priority health-risk behaviors of all regular Idaho public school students in grades 9 through 12. Survey Limitations The YRBS does have several limitations which may impact the reliability and usefulness of the results. The 2009 Idaho survey is administered to students enrolled in one of Idaho's public schools. Many teens who are at the highest risk for unhealthy behaviors may have dropped out of school and therefore are not represented by these results. In addition, respondents of self-reported surveys may have a tendency to under-report behaviors that are socially undesirable, unhealthy, or illegal (bullying, drug, alcohol and tobacco use, sexual assault, etc.) and over report behaviors which are socially desirable (exercise frequency, healthy diet, seat-belt use, etc.). Despite these limitations, YRBS data can be useful in tracking behaviors over time (trend data) and in making adolescent health program decisions.2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey Results Page 32009 YRBS De nitions by Topic Area Substance Use Current Use - is de ned as engaging in use of a substance (i.e., tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs) on one or more occasions during the 30 days previous to being surveyed. Lifetime Use - is de ned as engaging in use of a substance on one or more occasions at any time during the respondent's lifetime previous to being surveyed. Race/Ethnicity Hispanic - includes all students who selected the response \"yes\" to the question, \"Are you Hispanic or Latino?.\" Other races - includes all students who selected one or more of the following responses to the question \"What is your race?\": \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Asian,\" or \"Native Hawaiian or Other Paci c Islander.\" White - includes all students who selected \"White\" when asked \"What is your race?\"; and selected \"no\" to the question \"Are you Hispanic or Latino?.\" Statistical Signi cance Signi cant - referring to statistical signi cance; the word signi cant is used solely in this report to describe any statistically signi cant differences that exist between two or more measures being reported. Statistical signi cance was determined based on non-overlapping 95% con dence intervals associated with each of the compared measures. It is important to note that although differences between groups (e.g., between males and females, or between grade levels) or differences from year to year may not always be statistically signi cant, the results may be programmatically signi cant or signi cant on a practical level. Page 4 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior The 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) was completed by 2,164 students in 53 public high schools in Idaho during the spring of 2009. The school response rate was 93%, the student response rate was 84%, and the overall response rate was 79%. The results are representative of all students in grades 9-12. The weighted demographic characteristics of the sample are as follows: Female 48.4% 9th grade 26.4% African American 0.6% 25.4% 11th grade White 82.6% 12th All other races 2.3% Multiple races 1.8% Note: Due to rounding and/or weighting of results, and the overlap among racial and ethnic groups, the above demogaphic group totals may not add up to 100%.

Accidents (unintentional injuries) are the leading cause of death among Idaho teens and young adults. In 2007, there were 87 deaths among Idahoans aged 15 to 24, representing 48% of all deaths in that age-group. In particular, motor vehicle accidents account for the majority of accidental deaths as 58 of the 87 deaths (67%) were associated with motor vehicle accidents. 1 Head injury is the leading cause of death in motorcycle and bicycle crashes, although helmets substantially reduce the risk for serious head injuries. 2,3 Compared with other age groups, teens have the lowest rate of seat belt use.4 Injury in Idaho One in ten Idaho high school students drove a vehicle in the previous 30 days when he or she had been drinking alcohol Hispanic students (31%) were signi cantly more likely than White students (21%) to have ridden in a vehicle driven by someone who had been drinking Male students (11%) were almost twice as likely as female students (6%) to say they never or rarely wore a seatbelt when riding in a car driven by someone else Among those students who rode a bicycle in the previous 12 months, 85% never or rarely wore a bicycle helmetUnintentional & Intentional Injuries 100% 80% 60%40%20% 0% 9th Grade 10th Grade 11th Grade 12th Grade 9th-12th Total OverallPercentage of Idaho students who rode one or more times during the past 30 days in a car or other vehicle driven by someone who had been drinking alcohol 23.3%20.6% 22.0%23.2%20.8%22.2% 15.8%22.3% 22.2%24.4% 24.8%Female Male2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey Results Page 7Unintentional & Intentional Injuries Approximately nine out of ten homicide victims in the United States are killed with a weapon of some type, such as a gun, knife, or club. 5 Unintentional rearm- related fatalities are also a critical problem among children and young adults in the United States. 6 In 2007, 183 Idahoans died as a result of rearm-related injuries.1 One in four Idaho high school students (22%) carried some type of weapon (at any time) on one or more of the previous 30 days while 7% of students reported carrying a weapon on school property during the same timeframe. One in twelve students (8%) reported that they had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the previous year.Injury in Idaho Male students (34%) were four times as likely as female students (8%) to have carried a weapon on one or more of the previous 30 days Male students (14%) were signi cantly more likely than female students (3%) to have carried a gun during the previous 30 days White students (9%) were almost twice as likely to have carried a gun during the previous 30 days than Hispanic students (5%) One-third of all students had property, such as their car, clothing, or books stolen or deliberately damaged on school property one or more times during the previous 12 months HP 2010 Goal 15-39: Carrying a weapon Reduce weapon carrying by adolescents on school property to 6% Idaho 2003: Grade 11th Grade 12th Grade 9th-12th Total OverallPercentage of Idaho students who carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on one or more of the past 30 days 8.2%11.6%8.8% 9.4%6.2%37.7%29.7%34.2% 21.8%31.9%36.7%Female MalePage 8 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey ResultsUnintentional & Intentional Injuries YRBS injury-related questions measured the frequency and severity of physical ghting and abusive behavior. Among Idaho high school students, 29% were in a physical ght, 8% were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property, and 22% had been bullied at school during the previous year. Forced sex has been associated with suicidal ideation and attempts, 7 alcohol and drug use,8 and increased risk of chronic diseases and somatic symptoms in both reproductive and nonreproductive organ systems. 9 In Idaho, 14% of female students and 5% of male students report they have been physically forced to have sexual intercourse. One in ten Idaho students report they have been hit or slapped on purpose by their boyfriend or girlfriend during the previous year.Injury in Idaho Male students (17%) were more than twice as likely than female students (7%) to have been in a ght on school property during the previous 12 months 38% of Hispanic students (compared to 28% of White students) were in a physical ght one or more times in the previous 12 months 11% of high school students were hit, slapped, or physically hurt on purpose by their boyfriend or girlfriend during the previous 12 months 33% of all Hispanic students reported that they had been teased or called names because of their race or ethnic background (compared to 7% of White students) HP 2010 Goal 15-38: Physical ghting Reduce physical ghting among Grade 11th Grade 12th Grade 9th-12th Total OverallPercentage of Idaho students who were in a physical ght one or more times during the past 12 months 24.6% 13.6%20.3%24.1% 18.4%43.4% 24.7%37.1% 29.0%39.5% 39.3%Female Male2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey Results Page 9Unintentional & Intentional Injuries In 2007, suicide was the 2nd leading cause of injury related deaths among youth aged 15 to 19 in Idaho, and 45 Idahoans between the ages of 15 and 24 committed suicide. 1 According to results of the 2009 Idaho YRBS, 14% of all high school students seriously considered attempting suicide, 13% said they made a plan for how they would attempt suicide, and 8% reported attempted suicide during the previous year. In addition, 2% of Idaho students reported having made a suicide attempt that results in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to be treated by a doctor or nurse. Suicidal ideation is signi cantly more likely to occur more often among high school females than males in Idaho.Injury in Idaho Female students (36%) were signi cantly more likely than male students (21%) to report they felt so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more that they stopped doing some usual activities within the previous 12 months Female students (17%) were signi cantly more likely than male students (11%) to have seriously considered attempted suicide during the previous 12 months Although not statistically signi cant, female students (8%) were more likely to actually attempt suicde one or more times during the previous year than male students (5%) HP 2010 Goal 18-02: Sadness and suicidal ideation and attempts Reduce the rate of suicide attempts by adolescents Idaho 2003: 9% Grade 11th Grade 12th Grade 9th-12th Total OverallPercentage of Idaho students who seriously considered attempting suicide during the past 12 months 15.8% 14.6%17.4%23.3% 15.6% 9.9% 10.1% 10.9%14.2% Risk Behavior Survey ResultsTobacco Use The 2009 Idaho YRBS questionnaire contained 11 questions about tobacco use, including smoking experimentation, current smoking patterns, age of initiation, adherence to Federal regulations regarding sale of cigarettes, smoking on school property, and attempts to quit smoking. Tobacco use is considered the chief preventable cause of death in the United States with an estimated 18% of all deaths attributed to tobacco use. 10,11 If current patterns of smoking behavior persist, an estimated 24,000 Idaho youth are projected to die prematurely from smoking-related illnesses. 12 Among students who report current cigarette use, 6% smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day on the days they smoked and 9% of all high school students have smoked daily (that is at least one cigarette a day for 30 days).Tobacco Use in Idaho 40% of all high school students have tried cigarette smoking, and 9% smoked a whole cigarette before age 13 15% of all students smoked on one or more of the past 30 days (i.e. current smokers) 4% of students smoked on 20 or more of the past 30 days (i.e. frequent smokers) When it comes to smoking experimentation, Hispanic students are signi cantly more likely than White students to have both ever tried smoking and to have smoked before age 13 Among students who do smoke, 60% tried to quit at least once during the previous 12 months. HP 2010 Goal 27-02b: Cigarette use Reduce use of cigarettes in the past month by adolescents 11th Grade 12th Grade 9th-12th Total OverallPercentage of Idaho students who smoked cigarettes on one or more of the past 30 days (i.e., Current Behavior Survey Results Page 11Tobacco Use In the past 40 years, smokeless tobacco use has changed from a product used by older adults, particularly men, to a product used mostly by young men and boys. Despite being thought of as a safe alternative to smoking, smokeless tobacco increases the risk of many health problems and chronic conditions; and evidence shows that teens who use smokeless tobacco have a higher risk of becoming cigarette smokers within four years compared to those students who do not use smokeless tobacco. 13Tobacco Use in Idaho 15% of male students and 3% of female students used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip on one or more of the previous 30 days 6% of students used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip on school property on one or more of the previous 30 days 16% of male students and 8% of female students smoked cigars or cigarillos on one or more of the previous 30 days Male students (26%) were signi cantly more likely than female students (17%) to have used any form of tobacco during the previous 30 days HP 2010 Goal 27-02a: Current tobacco use Reduce use of any tobacco products in the past month by adolescents to 21% Idaho 2003: Grade 11th Grade 12th Grade 9th-12th Total OverallPercentage of Idaho students who used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip on one or more of the past 30 days 3.7% 3.3% 3.0% 1.8% 3.0%11.3%18.3%15.4% 9.4%14.4%17.1%Female MalePage 12 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey ResultsAlcohol and Other Drug Use Idaho 2003: 2009 Idaho YRBS questionnaire contained 19 questions about alcohol and other drugs, including: alcohol initiation and current use; marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and ecstasy use; inhalant (like paint or other aerosols); steroid; and injected drug use. Roughly one-third of crash-related deaths among persons aged 15-17 years and nearly half of those among persons aged 18-20 years are alcohol-related in the U.S. 14 In addition, the prevalence of drinking and driving increases substantially among youth and young adults with the frequency of alcohol use and is strongly associated with binge drinking. 15 In Idaho, 63% of high school students have drank alcohol in their lifetimes. One in ve (22%) Idaho students engaged in binge drinking (de ned as having ve or more drinks in a row) during the 30 days prior to completing the survey.Alcohol and Other Drug Use in Idaho 34% of high school students had at least one drink of alcohol during the 30 days prior to the survey (i.e., current drinking) Hispanic students (32%) were signi cantly more likely than White students (17%) to have had their rst drink of alcohol before age 13 41% of high school students who reported drinking alcohol in the previous 30 days, usually were given the alcohol 4% of students reported having at least one drink of alcohol on school grounds during the previous 30 days.

Nationally, 20% of all high school students smoked marijuana in the previous month and just over one-third (38%) of all high school students have used marijuana at least once during their lives. 17 Despite improvements in recent years, drug use is greater among high school students and other young adults in the U.S. than in any other industrialized nation in the world. 18 A recent study found that Cannabis use in the US and New Zealand (both 42%) was far higher than in any other country. The US was also an outlier in cocaine use (16%), well above averages found in other countries. 19Alcohol and Other Drug Use in Idaho One in three Idaho high school students has used marijuana one or more times during his or her lifetime Male students (8%) were twice as likely as female students (4%) to have tried marijuana for their rst time before the age of 13 Current marijuana use is highest among 12th grade male students with 18% reporting using marijuana one or more times in the previous 30 days HP 2010 Goal 26-10b: Marijuana use Reduce the proportion of adolescents reporting use of marijuana during the previous month100% 80% 60%40%20% 0% 9th Grade 10th Grade 11th Grade 12th Grade 9th-12th Total OverallPercentage of Idaho students who used marijuana one or more times during the past 30 days 8.3%12.6% 12.1% 13.1% 14.6%10.1%18.1% 15.2%13.7%15.2%17.1%Female MalePage 14 2009 Idaho Youth Risk Behavior Survey ResultsAlcohol and Other Drug Use Idaho 2003: Idaho 2007: N/A Idaho 2009: N/AIn addition to morbidity and mortality due to injury, drug abuse is related to suicide, early unwanted pregnancy, school failure, delinquency, and transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. 20,21 In Idaho, 6% of students have ever tried cocaine and 2% used it in the month prior to completing the YRBS survey.

In adolescence, obesity is associated with hypertension, abnormal glucose tolerance, and adverse psychological and social consequences. In the long term, regular physical activity decreases the risk of dying prematurely, dying of heart disease, and developing diabetes, colon cancer, and high blood pressure. 26 According to self-reported height and weight measurements, 12% of Idaho high school students are overweight and 9% are considered obese (based on BMI*).Weight Management and Dietary Behaviors in Idaho Male students (12%) were signi cantly more likely to be overweight than female students (5%) Female students (32%) were signi cantly more likely than male students (23%) to describe themselves as overweight Hispanic students (14%) were signi cantly more likely to be overweight than White students (8%) Among female students; 14% went without eating for 24 hours, 7% took diet drugs, and 6% vomited or took laxatives, in order to lose weight *The Idaho YRBS uses self-reported weight and height to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI), de ned as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Students are considered to be overweight if they have a BMI greater than the 85th percentile but less than the 95th percentile.

STATE/NATIONAL APPROVAL OF TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS The State Board of Education requires all teacher preparation programs to be evaluated on a seven-year cycle. This ev aluation occurs through a concurrent on- site visit by an NCATE (National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education) team and a state team. The NCATE team evaluates the unit, and the state team evaluates respective content area disciplines. Under the direction of the administrator of the Professional Standards Commission, the state evaluation team , utilizing the NCATE/Idaho pr otocol, conducts teacher preparation program evaluations. While all teacher prepar ation programs are subject to a state evaluation, NCATE eval uations are optional. All Idaho teacher preparation institutions, except The Coll ege of Idaho, BYU-Idaho, and the University of Phoenix - Idaho Campus, choose to under go an NCATE program evaluation. All Idaho teacher preparation pr ograms, however, must a ddress both state and NCATE standards when preparing for on-site teacher preparation program reviews. The official vehicle for the approval of existing teacher preparation programs in Idaho is the NCATE /Idaho partnership agree ment. State standards for evaluating teacher preparation programs are those approved by the St ate Board of Education 8effective July 1, 2001, and found in the Idaho Standards for Init ial Certification of Professional School Personnel manual.

Motion carried unanimously. APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Section 33-1405, Idaho Code BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Several students residing in the small Anne x School District in Malheur County, Oregon, across the Snake River from We iser, Idaho, have been attending school in Weiser School District No. 431. The tuition charged by the Weiser School District for each of the students from Oregon is set by Idaho Code \u00a733-1405. The tuition charged is more than the per pupil amount the Oregon state funding formula allocates to the Annex School Dis trict and continues to create a hardship to the Annex School District. The request for approval is coming befor e the State Board of Education again this year, because waiver request must be made annually for ea ch new student. Weiser School District has 20 new students this year which require approval. IMPACT The Weiser School District is requesting the State Board of Education waive a portion ($51.57 per month per student) of the tuition rate charge for each individual student attending Weiser High School from the Annex Sc hool District in Oregon for four years: 2009-10; 2010-11; 2011-12 and 2012-13, subject to annual review by the Weiser School District Board of Trustees. The addition of 20 st udents from the A nnex, Oregon area (repr esenting about 4% of the Weiser High School student body) in creases the costs of supplies, texts, and limited equipment (labs), but has little effect on the other budget lines and expenditures. The Annex District provides the bus transportation to Weiser High School.

It is my understanding that experience relative to economic development, and particularly technology transfer & commerciali zation would be valuable to the committee, and to that extent, I am pleased and honored to serve. It is my further understanding from conversati ons with Laird Noh and Ken Edmonds that I have been recommended for this membership based on my position with the Department of Commerce and our administration of the Idaho Innovation Council, which has been charged with affecting policy relative to statewide tech-transfer & commercialization in order to unlock this potential engine of economic growth within our state. Since the National Science Foundation specifically charges EPSCoR chapters with identifying and implementing economic development strategies, I feel as though a li aison between Idaho EPSCoR, the Department of Commerce, the Higher Education Research Council (on which I also serve), and the Innovation Council may be extremely beneficial to all of th ese entities. To the extent that you and the State Board of Education agree with that analysis, I am happy to serve in such a capacity. Attached please find my statement of qualifications relative to this appointment. If there are any questions that I may answer, plea se do not hesitate to contact me.

I have served as both an EPSCoR Committee member and as State Committee Chairman during peri ods of increasing E PSCoR funding for the State of Idaho. In addition to attending several Nationa l EPSCoR, NSF, and EPSCoR Coalition Meetings, I have consistently been involved in providing advice and assistance in the numerous grant proposal development efforts to the various EPSCoR federal agencies. I feel this experience, together with my business experience as past President of Jacklin Seed Company and currently Managi ng Partner of a family business park gives me an appreciation as to how important research in sc ience, technology, math, and engineering is to our state. I graduated from Washington State University with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Seed Physiology and Soil Chemistry and th en received an honorary Doctorate Degree from the University of Idaho. Following university graduation, I served as an officer in the US Navy's Pacific Fleet followed by six years in the Navy Reserve as Commanding Officer of the Naval Training Command's Center, Spokane, WA. In summary, I believe my credentials and past business experience as well as EPSCoR, involvement qualifies me for reappointment to the EPSCoR Committee. I have enjoyed my past tenure on the EPSC oR Committee and would look fo rward to being able to continue contributing to this important effort in the future. I respectfully request reappointment to the Idaho EPSCoR Committee. Sincerely, Doyle W.

REFERENCE December 2009 Board approved 1st Reading BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION The proposed changes to Board po licy accomplish the following: 1. Clarify the broad authority of the inst itution chief executive officers for personnel matters affecting the in stitutions. Section II.B.2.b. 2. Clarify specific authority in the chief executive officers to make institutional or unit-wide personnel adjustments, including furlough s and reductions in force, to respond to financial ch allenges. Sections II.B.2.b 3. Incorporate notice and due process procedures for affected employees. Sections II.B.2.c. 4. Clarify that contract salary is subj ect to adjustment year to year based on budgets and subject to interim adjustment s as part of instit utional or unit- wide personnel adjustments made by th e CEO's to respond to financial challenges. Sections II.F.1. & 2. (non-faculty exempt) & II.G.1. (Faculty) 5. Clean-up Financial Exigency Policy - remove references to actions that can be taken without a declaration of exigency. Sections II. N.1.; 2.d.; 2.e.; & 7. IMPACT There is no immediate financial impact on the institutions from these policy changes, rather the changes clarify the va rious tools available to the chief executive officers of the institutions to address bud get challenges caused by such things as general fund gubernator ial holdbacks (pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 67-3512A) and legislative budget cuts (either current year or out-year). If necessary, these policies would enable an inst itution to take quick initial action to respond to such financial challenges in or der to bridge to a new budget reality.

In addition, the Board Office received correspondence voicing comments and concerns from the president of the BSU Faculty Senate, several individual faculty members, and the pres ident of the Higher Education Council, BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 2 Idaho Federation of Teachers, AFL/CIO. Staff reviewed these comments and they were forward to Board members. Systemwide, the College and Universities have experienced a $56.5M or 19.8% reduction in State Gener al Funds since FY 2009 1 and additional mid-year and out-year budget cuts are imminent. These policy revisions clarify the authorit y and budgeting tools the institutional CEOs have to manage budget holdbacks and reductions. In so doing, these policies could serve to protect faculty and staff from the vagaries of a declaration of financial exigency which places everyt hing on the table in order to maintain operations in times of a financial crisis. Financial exigency can result in the elimination of posit ions and programs, and could jeopardize an institution's bond rating resulting in increased financ ial hardship to the institution. Board staff is of the opini on that these Policy changes would enable institutions to manage and mitigate financial, workfo rce, and programmatic exposure risk in times when an institution's financial posit ion has been severely compromised by reduced appropriations. No changes are recommended. Staff recommends approval of the second reading of Board Po licies II.B.2; II.F.1 & 2. II.G.1; and II.N. as submitted. BOARD ACTION A motion to approve the second reading of the proposed amendments to Board Policies II.B.2; II.F.1 & 2., II.G.1; and II.N. as submitted.

Appointment Authority and Procedures February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 3 B. Appointment Authority and Procedures 1. Nothing herein may be construed to be in limitation of the power s of the Board as defined by Sections 33- 3006, 33-3104, 33-2806, and 33-4005, I daho Code, or as otherwise defined in the Idaho Constitution or Code. 2. Delegation of Authority a. The Board delegates all authority for personnel management not specifically retained to the executive director and the chief executive officers consistent with the personnel policies and procedures adopt ed by the Board. In fulfilling this responsibility, the executive director and chief executive officers, or their designees, may exercise their authorit y consistent with these policies and procedures. Provided, however, that the Board retains the authority for taking final action on any matter so identi fied anywhere in these policies and procedures. b. Within the general delegati on of authority in the preceding parag raph a. above, the chief executive officers shall have the authority to manage, supervise and control the personnel and human resources of the institutions and agencies. Organizational structure, duty assignment s, FTE count, place of work, shift placement, salaries, work hour adjustment s, benefit determinations, reductions in force and all similar and related work plac e decisions are the prerogative of the chief executive officers exc ept or unless as limited by other applicable provisions of Board or institutional policy. c. Without limiting the general description of b. above, the authority delegated to each chief executive officer in cludes the authority, in the chief executive officer's discretion, to reduce expend itures to respond to financial challenges (without a financial exigency declarat ion by the Board) and to maintain sound fiscal management. In such cases, the chief ex ecutive officer may take employment actions, as provided in applicable inst itutional policy, which are uniform across the entire institution, or uniform across institution bud getary units, but may not include actions requiring a financial ex igency declaration by the Board. Such actions may include work hour adjustments such as furloughs or other unpaid leave as long as such are uniform across budgetary units or uniformly tiered as applied to certain salary levels or cla ssifications. Work hour adjustments may be pro-rated based on annual salary levels to equitably reduce the financial hardship of the adjustments on lowe r level employees. Such actions may include reductions in force (not including tenured faculty members) when such reductions can be accomplished without shortening the term of an existing annual employment contract. Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 1 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: B. Appointment Authority and Procedures February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 4 d. In implementing any such actions descri bed in the preceding paragraph c. above, the institution shall seek the input from the faculty, non-classified staff and classified staff employee groups. Such groups will be given at least twenty-one (21) calendar days to provide their input on the proposed actions as provided for in the policies of the institution. The institution shall, once such input is taken and considered by the chief executive officer, establish procedures that provide for at least thirty (30) days written notice prior to the effective date of the action and an opportunity for an affected employee to be heard. The notice must include the effective date of the employment action, a statement of the basis for the employment action, and a description of the process to be heard. Such process must be prompt, expeditious, and fair. The employee may contest the action only based on whether the action, with res pect to that employee, violates the procedural requirements of this policy, applicable institutional policy or constitutional or statutory protections for that employee. The employee may not challenge the chief executive officer's det ermination that a redu ction in budgetary expenditures is necessary, nor contest the chief executive officer's chosen means of addressing the reduction need, unless such means violate constitutional or statutory protections for the employee. 3. Specifically Rese rved Board Authority (Note: This is not an excl usive or exhaustive list and other reservations of Board authority may be found in other areas of these policies and procedures.) Board approval is required for the following: a. Position Authorizations (1) Any permanent new position (including any reactivated position that requires a new \"set-up\" action); regardless of funding source, requires Board approval.

Employment Terms a. All non-classified employees , except those set forth in Section II.F.1.b. below, serve at the pleasure of the chief execut ive officer, and may be dismissed at any time, with or without cause, and without no tice, at the discretion of the chief executive officer. b. Employment Contracts (1) An institution may provide employment contracts to its non-classified employees. If an institution chooses to o ffer employment contracts to its non- classified employees, the employment contract must include the period of the appointment, salary, pay periods, position title, employment status and such other information as the institution may elect to include in order to define the contract of employment. Non-cla ssified employees have no continued expectation of employment beyond thei r current contract of employment. (2) Non-classified employees, who serve pursuant to contracts of employment containing a stated salary are not guaranteed such salary in subsequent contracts or appointments, and such salary is subject to adjustment during the contract period due to financial exig ency (as provided for in Section II.N of Board Policy) or as provided for in section II.B.2.c of Board Policy. (3) Each employee must acknowledge rece ipt and acceptance of the terms of the employment contract by signing and re turning a copy to the institution initiating the offer of appointment. Failure or refusal of the employee to sign and return a copy of the employment cont ract within the time specified in the contract is deemed to be a rejection of the offer of employment unless the parties have mutually agreed in writing to extend the time. Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the in stitution from extending another offer to the employee in the event the in itial offer was not signed and returned in a timely manner. Any alteration by the employee of the offer is deemed a counter-offer requiring an affirmative act of acceptance by an officer authorized to enter into contracts of employment binding the institution. (4) Each contract of employ ment shall include a statement to the following effect and intent: \"The terms of employment set fo rth in this contract of employment are also subject to the Governing Polic ies and Procedures of the State Board of Education (or the Board of Regents of the University of Idaho, in the case of University of Idaho), and the policies and procedures of the institution.\" The contract shall also stat e that it may be terminat ed at any time for adequate cause, as defined in Section II.L. of B oard Policy, or when the Board declares Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 2 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II.

(5) No contract of empl oyment with such an employ ee may exceed one (1) year without the prior express approval of the Board. Employ ment beyond the contract period may not be legally pr esumed. Renewal of an employment contract is subject solely to the discret ion of the chief executive officer of the institution, and, where app licable, of the Board. 2. Compensation a. Salary - All non-classified employees shall receive a fixed salary. Payment in addition to the fixed salary may be author ized by the chief ex ecutive officer and reported to the Board. All initial sala ries for non-classified employees are established by the chief executive officer, subject to approval by the Board where applicable. The Board may make subs equent changes for any non-classified employee salary or may set annual sala ry guidelines and delegates to its executive director authority to review compliance with its annual guidelines. Any annual salary increase outside Board guidelines requires specific and prior Board approval before such increase may be ef fective or paid to the non-classified employee. With the exception of the chie f executive officers, and other positions whose appointment is a reserved Board au thority, approval of salaries shall be effective concurrently with Board appr oval of annual operat ing budgets for that fiscal year. b. Salaries, Salary Increases and other Compensation related items (1) Salaries for new appointments to dean, associate/assistant dean, vice president, and president/vice president di rect-report positions may not exceed the median rate for such position est ablished by the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources (CUPA), or its equivalent, without prior Board approval.

(3) Overtime Compensation - Non-classi fied employees earning annual leave at the equivalent rate of two (2) days for each month or major fraction thereof of credited state service are not eligible for either cash compensation or compensatory time off for overtime work. Non-classified employees in positions that are defined as \"non- exempt\" under the Fair Labor Standards Act earn overtime at a rate of one and one-half (1\u00bd) hours for each overtime Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 2 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: F. Policies Regarding Non-classified Employees February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 9 hour worked. Other non-classified em ployees may earn compensatory time off at the discretion of the chief execut ive officer at a rate not to exceed one (1) hour of compensatory time fo r each hour of overtime worked. (4) Credited State Service - The basis for earning credited state service will be the actual hours paid not to ex ceed forty (40) per week. (5) Pay Periods - All non-classified empl oyees are paid in accordance with a schedule established by the state controller. (6) Automobile Exclusion - Unless expressly authorized by the Board, no non- classified employee will receive an autom obile or automobile allowance as part of his or her compensation. 3.

Twelve-month employees employed at the entities named above may accrue leave up to a maximum of 240 hours. An employee who has accrued the maximum will not earn further leave un til the employee's us e of annual leave reduces the accrual below the maximum. Non-classified employees in positions wh ich are covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act earn annual leave according to \u00a7 67-5334 and are subject to the maximum leave accruals in \u00a7 67-5335(2). b.

Professional Leave - At the discretion of the chief exec utive officer, non-classified employees may be granted professional leave with or without compensation under conditions and terms as established by the chief executive officer. 4. Performance Evaluation Each institution or agency must est ablish policies and procedures for the performance evaluation of non-classified employees, and are responsible for implementing those policies in evaluating the work perfo rmance of employees. The purposes of employee evaluations are to identify areas of strength and weakness, to improve employee work performance, and to provide a basis on which the chief executive officers and the Board may ma ke decisions concerning retention, promotion, and merit salary increases . All non-classified employees must be evaluated annually. Any written recommendations that result from a performance Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 2 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: F. Policies Regarding Non-classified Employees February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 10 evaluation must be signed by the appropriate supervisor, a copy provided to the employee and a copy placed in the official pe rsonnel file of the employee. Evaluation ratings that result in findings of inadequ ate performance of dut ies or failure to perform duties constitute adequate cause as set forth in Section II.L. of Board Policy. 5. Non-Renewal of Non-classi fied Contract Employees a. Notice of the decision of the chief executive officer to not renew a contract of employment must be given in writing to the non-classified employee at least sixty (60) calendar days before the end of t he existing period of appointment for annual appointments. For appointments of less than one y ear, the written notice must be at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the existing period of appointment. Reasons for non-renewal need not be stated. Non-renewal without cause is the legal right of the Board. If any reasons fo r non-renewal are provided to the employee for information, it does not convert the non-renewal to dismissal for cause and does not establish or shift any burden of proof. Failure to give timely notice of non-renewal because of mec hanical, clerical, mailing, or similar error is not deemed to renew the contract of employment for another full term, but the existing term of employment mu st be extended to the number of days necessary to allow sixty (60) (or th irty days where applic able) calendar days notice to the employee. b. Except as set forth in this paragraph, non-renewal is not grievable within the institution nor is it appealable to the Board. Howe ver, if an employee presents bona fide allegations and evidence to the ch ief executive officer of the institution that the non-renewal of the contract of employment was the result of discrimination prohibited by applicable law, the employ ee is entitled to use the internal discrimination grievance procedur e to test the allegation. If the chief executive officer is the subject of the allegations, the employee may present the bona fide allegations and evidence to the Executive Director. The normal internal grievance procedure for discrimination must be used unless changed by mutual consent of the parties. The ultimate bur den of proof rests with the employee. The institution is required to offer evidence of its reasons for non -renewal only if the employee has made a prima facie show ing that the reco mmendation of non- renewal was made for reasons prohibite d by applicable law. Unless mutually agreed to by the parties in writing, t he use of the discrimination grievance procedure will not delay the effectiv e date of non-renew al. Following the discrimination grievance procedu res, if any, the decision of the institution, is final, subject to Section II.F.5.c., below. c. The non-classified cont ract employee may petition the Board to review the final action of the institution. Any petition for review must be filed at the Office of the State Board of Education within fifteen (15) calendar days after the employee receives notice of final action. The B oard may agree to review the final action, setting out whatever procedure and conditions for review it deems appropriate, or Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 2 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: F. Policies Regarding Non-classified Employees February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 11 it may choose not to review the final ac tion. The fact that a review petition has been filed will not stay the e ffectiveness of the final acti on, nor will t he grant of a petition for review, unless specifically provided by the Board. Board review is not a matter of right. An employee need not petit ion for Board review in order to have exhausted administrative rem edies for purposes of judicial review. Nothing in this section should be construed as any pr ohibition against filing a complaint with any appropriate state or federal entity, including but not li mited to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the Idaho Human Rights Commission (IHRC). 6. Tenure Non-classified employees are generally not ent itled to tenure. Certain, very limited, exceptions to this general rule are found in Subsection G.6 of these personnel policies and procedures.

Policies Regarding Faculty (Institutional Faculty Only) 1. Letters of Employment a. All faculty employees serve pursuant to employment contract s. The employment contract must include the period of the appointment, sala ry, pay periods, position title, employment status and such other in formation as the institution may elect to include in order to define the contra ct of employment. Non-tenured faculty employees have no continued expectation of employment beyond their current contract of employment. Each faculty employee must acknowledge receipt and acceptance of the terms of the employment contract by signing and returning a copy to the institution initiating the offer of appointment. Failure or refusal of the faculty employee to sign and return a copy of the employment contract within the time specified in the contract is deem ed to be a rejection of the offer of employment unless the parties have mutua lly agreed in writing to extend the time. Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the institution from extending another offer to the employee in the event the in itial offer was not signed and returned in a timely manner. Any alteration by the employee of the offer is deemed a counter-offer requiring an affirmative act of acceptance by an officer authorized to enter into contracts of employment binding the instit ution. Each contract of employment must include a statement to the following effect and intent: \"The terms of employment set forth in this letter (contract) of employment are also subject to the Governing Policies a nd Procedures of t he State Board of Education (or the Board of Re gents of the University of Idaho, in the case of the University of Idaho), and the policies and procedures of (t he institution).\" b. Term of Appointment - All non-tenured faculty employees have fixed terms of employment. No contract of employment with such an employee may exceed one (1) year without the prio r approval of the Board. Employment beyond the contract period may not be legally pr esumed. Reappointment of a faculty employment contract is subject solely to the discretion of the chief executive officer of the institution, and, where applicable, of the Board. c. Non-tenured faculty and tenured faculty, who serve pursuant to contracts of employment or notices (letters) of appoint ment containing a stated salary are not guaranteed such salary in subsequent contracts or appoint ments, and such salary is subject to adjustment during the contract period due to financial exigency (as provided for in Section II.N of Board Policy) or as provided for in section II.B.2.c of Board Policy.

Policies Regarding Faculty (Institutional Faculty Only) February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 14 d. Faculty Rank and Promotion (1) There are four (4) primary faculty r anks at each institution: (a) professor, (b) associate professor, (c) assistant professor, and (d) instructor. Each institution may establish add itional faculty ranks, specify the title of each rank, and delineate the requirements for eac h faculty rank so established. Recommendations for additional faculty ranks must be submitted by the chief executive officer to the Board for approval. (2) Faculty rank, including initial appoin tment to faculty rank and any promotion to a higher rank at an institution, is lo cated in a department or equivalent unit. (3) Each institution must establish criteria for initial appointment to faculty rank and for promotion in rank at the instituti on. Such criteria must be submitted to the Board for approval, and upon approval must be published and made available to the faculty. (4) Persons who have made substantia l contributions to their fields of specialization or who have demonstrated exceptional scholarship and competence or appropriate creativ e accomplishment of recognized outstanding quality may be a ppointed to faculty r ank without satisfying established institutional criteria for init ial appointment or pr omotion, provided that the qualificati ons of such individuals have been reviewed in accordance with institutional procedures and t he appointment is recommended by the chief executive officer and approved by the Board. (5) A non-classified employee may hol d faculty rank in a department or equivalent unit in which rank has previously been established by the institution. A non-classified employee may be granted rank at the time of appointment or subsequent t hereto, or may be promoted in rank, if such employee meets the criteria for rank as establishe d by the institution and approved by the Board. 2. Compensation a. Salary All initial salaries for faculty employees are established by the chief executive officer, subject to approval by the Boar d where applicable. Payment in addition to regular salaries must be aut horized by the chief executive officer and reported to the Board. The Board may make subs equent changes for faculty employee positions or may set annual salary gui delines and delegate to its executive director authority to review complianc e with its annual guidelines. Any annual salary increase outside B oard guidelines requires s pecific and prior Board Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 3 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II.

Salaries, Increases and other Compensation related items (1) For purposes of categorizing facult y employees for salary and reporting purposes, the following definition applies: Faculty includes all persons whose specific assignments customarily are made for the purpose of conducting instruction, research, or public service as a principal activity (or activities), and who hold the following aca demic rank or titles of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor, lecturer, or the equivalent of any of these academic ranks. Report in this category deans, directors, or the equivalents, as well as associate deans, assistant deans, and executive officers of academic departments (chairper sons, heads, or the equivalent) if their principal activity is instructi onal. Do not include student teaching or research assistants or medical interns or residents. (For reporting purposes, deans, associate deans, and assist ant deans are included in the executive/administrative category.) (2) Credited State Service/ Full Time Status - A facult y member employed for an academic year and paid over a twelve -month period will be credited with twelve (12) months of state service. For all benefit status determinations and calculations, faculty members shall be considered full time, year round employees of the employing institution as long as the employee's teaching, research and service duties are commensur ate with the full time faculty work load assignment as defined by the employing institution. (3) Pay Periods - All faculty employees, including those on academic-year appointments, are paid in accordance with a schedule established by the state controller. (4) Automobile Exclusion - Unless expr essly authorized by Board policy, no faculty employee will receiv e an automobile or automobile allowance as part of his/her compensation. 3. Annual Leave a. Only faculty members serving twel ve (12) month appointments earn annual leave. Such annual leave shall be earne d in the same manner as for non- classified employees. Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 3 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: G. Policies Regarding Faculty (Institutional Faculty Only) February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 16 b. Sabbatical Leave (1) Eligibility A sabbatical leave may be granted at the di scretion of the chief executive officer to a tenured faculty member (or a professional-technical faculty member) who has completed at least six (6) years of full-time service at an institution. A sabbatical leave may not be awarded to the same faculty member more than once in any six (6) academic years and sabbatical leave time is not cumulative. Sabbatical leave proposals must be submitted, reviewed, and processed according to policies and procedures established at each institution. A sabbat ical leave may be used for the purpose of acquiring new professional skills and updating professional skills or conducting research. Sabbatical leave awards are fully dependent on the availability of appropriate funding. (2) Term The term of a sabbatical leave is either one (1) academic semester at full pay or two (2) semesters at half pay. (3) Condition Each faculty member who is granted a sabbatical leave must serve at the institution for at least one (1) academic y ear after completion of the sabbatical unless the chief executive officer appr oves a waiver of the requirement. (4) Report on Sabbatical Leave By the end of the first semester followi ng return to the institution from a sabbatical leave, the faculty member must submit a written account of sabbatical activities and accomplishments to the academic vice president. (5) Report to the Board The chief executive officer must report the names of faculty members awarded sabbatical leaves and a brief statement of the purposes of each sabbatical in their semi- annual report to the Board 4. Performance Evaluation a. Annual Evaluation - Each y ear the chair of a department must submit to the dean of the chair's college an ev aluation of each faculty member in the department. This evaluation, together with the input of higher administrator s, will be used as (1) basis for the final recommendation relative to reappointment, non-Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 3 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: G. Policies Regarding Faculty (Institutional Faculty Only) February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 17 reappointment, acquisition of tenure, or other personnel action, whichever is appropriate. The chairman must communica te an assessment of strengths and weaknesses to each faculty member evaluated. b. Evaluation Criteria - Evaluation of faculty should be made in terms of the individual's effectiveness. Ea ch institution shall publish its criteria for annual evaluation and ensure that all members of the faculty have access to the criteria. c. Any written recommendations that result from evaluation of a faculty employee will be given to the employee and a copy will be placed in the employee's file. d. Each institution must develop policies, procedures, and measurement instruments to be used in the evaluati on by students of faculty teaching effectiveness. 5. Non-renewal of Non-tenured Faculty Members a. Notice of non-renewal must be given in writing and in accordance with the following standards: (1) First Year Of Service - No t later than March 1 of the fi rst full academic year of service if the appointment is not to be renewed at the end of the academic year; or if a one-year appoi ntment terminates during an academic year and is not to be renewed, at least three (3) m onths in advance of its termination. (2) Second Year of Service - Not late r than December 15 of the second full academic year of service if the appointment is not to be renewed at the end of the academic year; or, if the appointment terminates during an academic year and is not to be renewed, at least six (6) months in advance of its termination. (3) Three (3) Or More Years Of Service - Not later than July 15 preceding the academic year at the end of which the appointment is to be terminated; or, if the appointment terminates during an academic year and is not to be renewed, at least twelve (12) mont hs in advance of its termination. (4) Failure to provide timely notice of non-renewal because of mechanical, clerical, or mailing error does not extend or renew t he letter or contract of employment for another term, but the existing term of employment will be extended to provide the employee with a timely notice of non-renewal. (5) Financial Exigency - Notice of non-r enewal is not required when the Board has authorized a reduction in force result ing from a declaration of financial exigency and a non-tenured faculty member is to be laid off. In that event, notice of layoff must be give n as provided under the policies for reduction in force. Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 3 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: G. Policies Regarding Faculty (Institutional Faculty Only) February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 18 b. Request For Review (1) Non-renewal is not subject to inve stigation or review except that the employee may request an investigation or review to establish that written notice was or was not received in acco rdance with the time requirements set forth in this section. In such case s, the investigation or review will be concerned only with manner and date of notificat ion of non-renewal. The employee must request such investigatio n or review in writing of the chief executive officer within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the written notice of non- renewal. (2) Provided, however, that if the non-tenured faculty member presents bona fide allegations and evidence in writing to the chief executive officer of the institution that the non -reappointment was the result of discrimination prohibited by applicable law, the non-tenured faculty member is entitled to use the internal discrimination grievanc e procedure to test the allegation. In such cases, the same procedures, burden of proof, time limits etc. as set forth for the grievance of non-renewal by non-classified employees shall be used (see subsection F). c. Non-tenured faculty members who are no tified that they will not be reappointed or that the succeeding academic year will be the terminal year of appointment are not entitled to a statem ent of reasons upon which t he decision for such action is based. No hearing to review such a decision will be held. 6. Tenure a. Tenure Defined - Tenure is a conditi on of presumed continuous employment following the expiration of a probati onary period and after meeting the appropriate criteria. Afte r tenure has been awarded, the faculty member's service may be terminated only for adequat e cause; except in the case of retirement or financial exigency as declared by the Boar d; in situations where extreme shifts of enrollment have eliminated the justif ication for a position; or where the Board has author ized elimination or substantial reduction in a program. Tenure status is available only to eligible, full-time institutional faculty members, as defi ned by the institution. A ll faculty appointments are subject to the approvals as required in Board policy. N ontenured members of the faculty are appointed to term appoi ntments pursuant to subsection G1. Any commitment to employ a nontenured member of the faculty beyond the period of his or her current term of appointment is wholly ineffective. Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 3 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: G. Policies Regarding Faculty (Institutional Faculty Only) February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 19 b. Acquisition of Tenure (1) Professional-Technical Faculty hired under the divisi on of professional- technical education prior to July 1, 1993 who were granted tenure may retain tenure in accordance with these policies. Individuals hired under the Division of Professional-T echnical education subsequent to July 1, 1993 are hired and employed as nont enure track faculty and will: (a) be afforded the right to pursue promotion; and (b) be considered and granted an employ ment contract in accordance with these policies and be subjec t to continued acceptable performance and/or the needs of the institution; and (c) be afforded on opportunity to serve on institutional committees. (2) Academic faculty members , after meeting certain requirements, established by the employing instit ution, may acquire tenure. Each institution shall develop policies for the acquisition of tenure that are consistent with this gener al philosophy and policy st atement of the Board. Acquisition of tenure is not automatic, by default or defacto, but requires an explicit judgment, decisi on, and approval. A facult y member is eligible to be evaluated for the acquisition of tenure after having completed four (4) full years of academic employment at the instituti on, although tenure may be awarded prior to completion of this initial eligibilit y period in certain exceptional cases as provided in Boar d Policy II.G.6.d.4.a). In addition, an academic faculty member must be eval uated for the acquisition of tenure not later than the faculty member's sixth (6th) full academic year of employment at the instit ution. In certain exceptional cases a faculty member may petition for extension of the timeline for tenure due to extenuating circumstance s as provided in Board Policy II.g.6.d.4.b). c. Notification - An individual eligible for tenure must be informed, by proffered written contract, of appoint ment or nonappointment to tenure not later than June 30 after the academic year during wh ich the decision is made. In case of denial of tenure, the faculty member must be given a written notice that tenure was denied. d. Standards of Elig ibility for Tenure (1) Annual Appointments - Un til the acquisition of tenure, all appointments are made for a period not to exceed one (1) year. Prior to the award of tenure, employment beyond the annual term of appointment may not be legally presumed. Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 3 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: G. Policies Regarding Faculty (Institutional Faculty Only) February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 20 (2) Service in Professional Rank - All satisfactory service in any professorial rank may be used to fulfill the time requirement for acquiring tenure. Each institution must develop criteria and rules by which prior service may be evaluated for inclusion in experience necessary for acquiring tenure. (3) Service in Instructor Rank - A ma ximum of two (2) years satisfactory service in the rank of instructor at t he institution will be allowed in partial fulfillment of the time r equirement in the professorial ranks. Faculty members who hold the rank of instructor may be el igible for tenure status if provided for by the institution even though they teach in fields that have established professorial ranks. (4) Exceptional Cases (a) Tenure may be awarded prior to co mpletion of the us ual eligibility period in certain exceptional cases. In such cases, the burden of proof rests with the individual. (b) Extension of the tenure review period may be granted in certain exceptional cases. In such cases the faculty member must formally request such an extension and indicate the reason for the request. An institution that permits an ext ension of the tenure review period must include in its policies the procedure a faculty member must follow to request such an extensi on, and the basis for determining the modified timeline for review. e. Evaluation For Tenure - It is expected that the chief executive officer, in granting tenure, will have sought and considered evaluations of each candidate by a committee appointed for the purpose of annual evaluations or tenure status. Such committee must consist of tenured and non-tenured faculty; student represent ation; and one (1) or more representatives from outside the department. Each member of the committee has an equal vote on all matters. The committee must gi ve proper credence and weight to collective student evaluatio ns of faculty members, as evidenced by an auditing procedure approved by the chief executive officer. The recommendation of the committee will be forwarded in writing through appropriate channels, along with written recommendat ions of the department chairperson or unit head, dean, and appropriate vice president, to the chief executive officer, who is responsible for making the final decision. f. Award of Tenure - The awarding of t enure to an eligible faculty member is made only by a positive action of the chief executive officer of the institution. The president must give notice in wr iting to the faculty member of the approval or denial of tenure. Notwithstanding any provisions in these policies to the contrary, no person will be deemed to have been awarded tenure because notice is not given Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 3 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: G. Policies Regarding Faculty (Institutional Faculty Only) February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 21 g. Periodic Performance Review of Tenur ed Faculty Members - It is the policy of the Board that at intervals not to exce ed five (5) years fo llowing the award of tenure to faculty members, the perfo rmance of tenured faculty must be reviewed by members of the depar tment or unit and the department chairperson or unit head. The review must be conducted in terms of the tenured faculty member's continuing performance in the following general categories: teaching effectiveness, research or creative activities, professional related services, other assigned responsibilities, and overall contributions to the department. (1) Procedures for periodic review - Each institution must establish procedures for the performance review of tenured faculty members at the institution. Such procedur es are subject to the re view and approval of the Board. Each year the academic vice president or designee is responsible for designating in writing thos e tenured faculty members whose performance is subject to review during the year. (2) Review standards - Each institution may establish its own internal review standards subject to approval by the Board. Absent such institutional standards, the institution must use the following standards. If during the periodic review, the performance of a tenured fa culty member is questioned in writing by a majority of members of the department or unit, the department chairperson or unit head, the appropriate dean, the appropriate vice president, or the chief executiv e officer, then the appropriate vice president or equivalent administrator mu st decide whether a full and complete review must be conducted in accordanc e with the procedures established for the initial evaluation for tenure at the institution. If during the periodic review, the performance of a tenured faculty member is not questioned in writing, members of the department or unit and the department chairperson or unit head must prepare a written review stat ement that the performance review has been conducted and that a full and comp lete review is not required. (3) Exception for Associate Professors in the Promotion Process - Generally, the promotion from the rank of asso ciate professor to full professor is considered no earlier than t he fifth full year after attaining the rank of associate professor, which is generally contem poraneous with the granting of tenure. In such cases, if review for promotion to full professor is scheduled during the fifth, sixth or seventh full year after the award of tenure then the promotion review may, if it meets substantially similar criteria and goals of the post tenure review, take the place of the periodic performance review described here. (4) Termination of employm ent - If, following a full and complete review, a tenured faculty member's perfo rmance is judged to have been Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 3 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: G. Policies Regarding Faculty (Institutional Faculty Only) February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 22 unsatisfactory or less than adequate during the period under review, the chief executive officer may initiate termination of employment procedures for the faculty member. In other word s, an unsatisfactory or less than adequate performance rating shall c onstitute adequate cause for dismissal. h. Dismissal for Adequate Cause - Tenured faculty me mbers may be dismissed for adequate cause as provided for in Subsection L of this Section. i. Tenure for Academic Administrators (1) \"Academic administrat ors,\" for purposes of this topic, means the chief academic officers of the Office of the State Board of Education and the institutions and the deans and department chairs and their associates/assistants of the academic units of the institutions, and shall not include persons occupying ot her administrative positions. (2) An employee with tenure in an academic department or equivalent unit who is appointed to an academic adminis trator position retains tenure in that department or equivalent unit (3) An individual hired for or prom oted to an academic administrator may be considered for a tenured faculty rank in the appropriate department or equivalent unit. Such consideration is contingent upon approval by the institution's president. (4) Upon termination of employment as an academic administrator, an employee with tenure may, at his or her option, return to employment in the department or equivalent unit in which he or she holds tenure unless such employee resigns, retires, or is terminated for adequate cause. (5) An individual hired for a non-aca demic administrator position from outside the institution will not be considered for tenured fa culty rank in conjunction with such appointment. However, he or she may be granted an adjunct faculty appointment, upon the reco mmendation of the appropriate department and dean and with the approval of the provost or chief academic officer and president, if the individual will teach and otherwise contribute to that department. (6) Notwithstanding the above, each adm inistrative employee who is granted tenure shall be reviewed in the sa me manner as tenured faculty j. Terminal Contract of Employment - If a faculty member is not awarded tenure, the chief executive officer must notify the faculty member of the decision not to recommend tenure and may, at his or her discretion, either issue to the Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 3 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: G.

Such appointment for faculty members not awarded tenure must be on an annual basis, and such temporary appointments do not vest in the faculty member any of the rights inherent in tenure and there s hall be no continued expectation of employment beyond the annual appointment. k. When authorized by the chief executive officer, or his or her designee, the year in which the tenure decision is made may be the terminal year of employment. l. Effect of lapse in service, tr ansfer, reassignment, reorganization, and administrative responsibilities. (1) A non-tenured faculty member who has left the institution and is subsequently reappointed after a lapse of not more than three (3) years may have his or her prior service counted toward eligibility for the award of tenure. Eligibility for the award of tenure must be cl arified in writing before reappointment. A tenured faculty member who has left the institution and is subsequently reappointed after a laps e of not more than three (3) years must have tenure status clarified in writing by the president or his designee before appointment. The faculty member may be reappointed with tenure, or may be required to serve additional y ears before being reviewed for tenure status. (2) Before a non-tenured faculty mem ber holding academic rank is moved from one position in the institution to another, the member must be informed in writing by the academic vice president, after consultation with the receiving department, as to the extent to which prior service may count toward eligibility for tenure status. (3) No faculty member's tenure in a discipline may be adversely affected by the reorganization of the administrative structure. A faculty member's tenure is not affected by reassignment of administrative responsibilities. (4) When a tenured faculty member is serving as department chairman, college dean, or in some ot her administrative or service capacity, retention of membership, academic rank, and tenure in the subject-matter department or similar unit is maintain ed. Should the administrative or service responsibilities terminate, the member takes up regular duties in the discipline within which membership, academic rank, and tenure was retained.

Financial Exigency The Board recognizes that in order to di scharge its responsibilities for the agencies or institutions under its gover nance, it may become necessary to curtail, modify, or eliminate some of the programs of the agencies or instit utions due to unfavorable economic conditions. The Board further recognizes that it must dedicate its resources to the achievement of t he purposes and goals of its agencies or institutions. As used here, \"financial exigency\" means a demonstrably bona fide financial crisis that adversely affects an ag ency or institution as a whole, or one (1) or more programs, or other distinct units. A financial exigency exists only upon Board declaration, and the responsibility and authority to make such a declaration rests solely with the Board. The realities of the legislative appropriation process, the state revenue collection process, the possi bility of budget hold-backs via executive order and the subseq uent analysis needed bef ore the Board declares a financial exigency may allow little time for official notice of a declaration of a financial exigency and may require that the decision to declare a financial exigency be based on estimated revenues, rather than on actual revenues. The Board must take action by written resolution setting forth the basis for its decision to declare a financial exigency, after notice and hearin g, at a regular or specia l meeting of the Board. This subsection N addresses potential re sponses to a declared financial exigency including: (1) the layoff of non-classified contract employees, tenured faculty, and non- tenured faculty, and classified employees during the term of their contract of employment; (2) the closure, relocation, or discontinuance of any programs, units, or activities; or (3) any combination thereof. This subsection N does not apply to the organization or reorganization of the institutions or agencies under the governanc e of the Board, nor does it limit the authority delegated by the Board to the chie f executive officers to organize and reorganize the institutions or agencies, including the authority to take certain employment actions, as provided in sect ion II.B.2.b. of the Board's Governing Policies and Procedures, ei ther independently or, in response to, a declared financial exigency. In addition, this subsec tion N is not applicable to the following situations: a. When a reduction in force occurs purs uant to, and for those employees subject to, the State Board for Professional-Technical Education's administrative rules governing post-secondary reduction or te rmination (IDAPA 55.01.02), which excludes community colleges. b. When a reduction in force occurs wher e the reductions are made via the non- renewal process for non-classified contract staff and non-tenured faculty.

Staff Reduction Procedures - All Employees February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 26 c. When a reduction in force occurs purs uant to Board policies (Section III. G.) for program consolidation, relo cation or discontinuance not resulting from financial exigency. Program closure, relocation, reduction, or discontinuance pursuant to Section III.G shall not be implemented utiliz ing any policy or procedure in this Section II. N. d. When a reduction in force affects Stat e of Idaho classified employees using the procedures of the State Divis ion of Human Resources or classified employees of the University of Idaho us ing the policies of the University of Idaho. e. When a reduction in force affect s non-classified at-will employees. 2. Response by an Institution or Agen cy to a Declared Financial Exigency a. After active consultation with employees , including faculty, professional staffs, and classified personnel, the Chief Executive Officer of each agency or institution must prepare a plan (the \"Plan\") in response to the declaration of financial exigency. When developing this Plan, consideration must be given to the necessity and manner of reduc ing the employment force, the appropriate units or subunits to be affected, and the criteria for identifying the employees who are affected by the Plan. Once completed, the Plan must be approv ed by the Board. Provided, however, that im plementation of the Plan and notices required to be given in the Plan may begin pr ior to Board approval, which approval shall then also include ratification of such actions. b. Each of the institutions shall seek advice from a committee, which may include representatives of the adminis tration, faculty, staff or students, on the state of the financial exigency and possibl e responses thereto. c. Notwithstanding any other Board policy, order or ru le, or the policies of any institution or agency, all cat egories of employees may be la id off as a result of a Board declared financial exigency. The pr ocess used to layoff employees must be done equitably (but not necessarily uniformly), in good faith, and in a systematic manner directly relat ed to the financial exigency. d. Program Closure, Reloca tion and Discontinuance. Wh en the Plan for responding to a declared financial exigency incl udes the closure, relocation or discontinuance of a program, such program closure, re location or discontinuance shall be subject only to the requirement s of this subsection N and not to any other Board policy, including specifically, but not limited to, section III.G, and its related guidelines. However, arr angements should be made for enrolled students to complete affected programs in a timely manner and with minimum interruptions.

Staff Reduction Procedures - All Employees February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 28 a financial exigency layoff, include, but are not limited to, academic, non- instructional, maintenance, administrative, and other su pport areas. Other criteria that must be considered include, but are not limited to, tenure, rank, time in rank, length of service, field of specialization, maintenance of necessary programs or services, maintenance of affirmative ac tion programs, and quality of service and work. b. Notice of Financial Exigency Layoffs (1) Form of Notice. The Board recogni zes that any layoff may be a severe economic and personal loss to an employ ee. Therefore, and within the time frame provided in this policy, the Chie f Executive Officer must give notice in writing to employees who are affect ed by a financial exigency layoff, which notice must include the e ffective date of the layoff; a statement of the basis for the Board's declaration of a financia l exigency; a statement of the basis, the procedures, and the crit eria used to layoff an employee; any opportunity for reconsideration or appeal, including access to appropriate documentation, and the issues that may and may not be considered; and the reinstatement rights of the employee. (2) Time. Each agency or institution should make every reasonable effort to give as much notice as is practical, in light of the financial exigency, to each employee in advance of the effective dat e of the layoff. The Board requires each agency or instituti on under its governance to the following minimum time for written notice of layoff: (a) Non-classified Contract Employee s And Non-tenured Faculty - Not less than sixty (60) calendar days before the effective date of the layoff. Provided, however, that if under the express terms of the employee's contract the employment may be terminated on less notice, then the shorter notice provided in the contract shall apply. (b) Tenured Faculty - To tenured fa culty members occupying faculty positions, a notice of layoff with the e ffective date of layoff being at the end of the first full semester (Fall or Spring) after the financial exigency is declared. c. Hearing Procedures (1) All employees of the institutions or agencies who receive a notice of a financial exigency layoff have the right to appear before the Board at the meeting of the Board where the Board will take action on the Plan. Such appearance shall be governed by the Board's policies, procedures and Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 4 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: N. Staff Reduction Procedures - All Employees February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 29 guidelines regarding te stimony before the Board. In addition, categories of employees shall have hearing rights as set forth below in this subtopic c. (2) Non Tenured Faculty and Non-classifi ed Contract Employ ees' Hearing Rights (a) In most instances, a layoff of non-tenured faculty and non-classified employees serving under a contract of employment for a fixed term may be accomplished by non-renewal of the contract of employment rather than by layoff during the term of empl oyment. Non-renewal after a Board declared financial exigency does not require a hearing nor is the non- renewal appeal able at the agency or institution, nor is it appeal able to the Board. (b) If a non-tenured faculty member occ upying a permanent faculty position or a non-classified employee serving under a contract of employment for a fixed term is laid off during the te rm of employment due to a financial exigency, the faculty member or empl oyee is entitled to the pre-layoff hearing procedures set forth in paragraph (4) below. (3) Tenured Faculty Hearing Rights. All Tenured faculty members occupying permanent faculty positions who are la id off due to a financial exigency are entitled to the pre-layoff hearing procedur es set forth in paragraph (4) below. (4) Financial Exigency Layoff Hearing Procedures (a) The financial exigency layoff heari ng procedures at the institutions or agencies must ensure a prompt and expedi tious hearing that is fair and unbiased, but the hearing sh all be informal. The application of evidentiary rules, questioning of wit nesses (including cross-examination), rules concerning burden of proo f, the participation of l egal counsel, and similar and related attributes of more forma l adjudication shall not be required. The final written recommendation of t he hearing body or officer must be conveyed to the Chief Executive Office r of the institution or agency who shall make a final decision. An em ployee may ask the Chief Executive Officer to reconsider the decision. Such a request must be filed in writing with the Chief Executive Officer within fi fteen (15) days of the notice of the final decision of the in stitution or agency. T he decision of the Chief Executive Officer in response to the rec onsideration request is final except as modified by the Board pursuant to an appeal under Section II.M. Use of these hearing procedures does not delay the effective date of the layoff. (b) Grounds to Contest. The employee may contest the layoff on the following grounds: Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 4 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II. HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Subsection: N. Staff Reduction Procedures - All Employees February 2010 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 2 Page 30 (i) Whether the agency or instituti on followed the appropriate policies and procedures and the terms of the Plan; (ii) Whether the layoff was made for constitutionally impermissible reasons; or (iii) Whether any other improper criteria were applied. (c) Limitations Upon Review. The hearing body or officer will not review the Board's decision to declare a financia l exigency or the funding distribution among and within the instit utions or agencies. The decision of the Board to declare a financial exigency is at the Board's sole discretion and may not be contested by any employee in any type of hearing or appeal procedure. (d) Employees may request that the Board hear an appeal of the final decision of the chief executive office r as provided in Board policy section II.M.2.b. Such a request does not delay the effective date of the layoff. 6. Reinstatements Rights a. Tenured Faculty In cases of a financial exigency layo ff of tenured faculty members occupying permanent faculty positions, the posit ion concerned may not be filled by replacement within a period of three (3) year s from the effective date of the layoff unless the tenured faculty member has been offered a return to employment in that position and has not accepted the offer within th irty (30) calendar days after the offer is extended. (1) Refusal Of Reinstatement Offer. If an o ffer of reinstatement is not accepted, the tenured faculty member's name may be deleted from th e reinstatement list, and, if so deleted, the Board has no further obligation to the faculty member.

Financial Exigency Program Closu re, Relocation or Discontinuance. a. Faculty or staff being laid off as a resu lt of a program closure, relocation or discontinuance pursuant to a financial exigency Plan sha ll be entitled to the same Idaho State Board of Education ATTACHMENT 4 GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: II.

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Fundraising efforts for a new Coll ege of Business and Economics (COBE) building began in the late 1990's. At t hat time a general understanding of the needs of the growing program and the sc ope of the building were developed through campus discussion. The building was incorpor ated in the 2005 Master Plan and has since been included in the comprehensive financing plan for major capital improvements. The new COBE building is a signi ficant undertaking for the Boise State University campus. Given it s prominent location at the corner of Capitol Boulevard and Univ ersity Drive, the buildi ng will become a landmark in the city landscape and will mark the we stern main entrance to the campus. In September 2008 the University initia ted a programming study to determine the appropriate size and type of functional space needed to support the college's operations in a new facility. In April 2009 the Board approved a request for the planning and design of the new COBE buildi ng. The Department of Public Works was authorized to secure design services and an architectu ral design team was selected and has complet ed preliminary design. The new COBE building is designed to effe ctively address the current and future growth needs of the College. The build ing will provide appr oximately 71,324 assignable square feet of space for the departments of A ccounting, Network Operations and Information Systems, Economics, Management, Marketing and Finance. It will incorporate m odern and innovative instructional facilities including: case-study rooms, classrooms, comput er labs, a high-tech financial trading center, student services center, and team rooms. T here will also be offices and meeting spaces to support faculty intera ction and research efforts, and spaces are planned for outreach to and support of the local business community. Design BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 1 Page 2 development documents show the build ing to be approximately 117,312 gross square feet. A summary of the space ty pes with assignable and gross areas is included as Attachment # 1. IMPACT Cost estimates based on the design dev elopment documents indicate a construction cost of $28,870,000. Cont ingencies, architectural and engineering fees, commissioning, testing, and other ad ministrative and so ft costs brings the estimated total project cost to $37,000, 000. This project will be brought back to the Board for financing approval prior to contract award. Portions of the work, including the build out of the second leve l above the lecture hall, will be bid as al ternates in an effort to assu re a successful award within the budget. Even with the margin which additive alternates may provide, continuing volatility and inflation create risk for the University. Accordingly the University has incorporated contingency funds into t he estimated project cost should they be necessary to award the bid. In the event that bid results come in below estimates, the University may proceed wi th the purchase and installation of furniture, fixtures and equipment for this project within the budget authorized by the Board. The funding for the project leverages the strategic facility fee by utilizing several additional funding sources. The Foundation expects to receive cash donations to taling $14,500,000 by March 31, 2010, with additional pledges totaling $3,000,000 for a total of $17,500,000. Additionally, the COBE Building is the first academic project to benefit from the Academic Capital Project Fund (ACPF) . The ACPF was created during the development of the Stueckl e Sky Center and is fun ded by athletic revenues resulting in the athletic department revenues funding so me of the construction costs for the new College of Business. The projected funding pa ckage is as follows: Gifts and Pledges (cash on hand): $14,500,000 Strategic Facilities Fee Bonds: 14,000,000 Bond Bond Reserves and ACPF: 4,500,000 Total $37,000,000 This project will be procured through the standard process through the State of Idaho Department of Public Works and/ or the State of Idaho Department of Purchasing as appropriate.

As a hedge against market volatility, portions of the wo rk will be bid as additive alternates. The university has built a $1.4M cons truction contingency and $3M project contingency into the total cost of the projec t. If bids are favorable, the university could build out a second level above t he lecture hall, and ma y proceed with the purchase and installation of furniture, fixtures and equipment for the project.

Because of this shortfall, students who want to live on campus are currently living at the University Inn and in off- campus hotel rooms. Over the past thre e years, applications for on-campus housing have increased by ov er 70 percent. Conservative estimates are that the University needs an additional 3,000- 6,000 beds to meet this demand. To meet the growing demand for on-campus housing, the University seeks to partner with American Cam pus Communities (ACC), one of the nation's largest developers, owners and managers of hi gh-quality student housing communities, to develop and manage new on-campus housing. Since 1996, ACC has developed and acquired more than $2 billi on in student housing assets. Working with ACC allows the University to devel op new housing withou t issuing debt or using central cash reserves. The terms of the proposed transaction we re contained in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) approved by the B oard in June, 2009. After the Board approval, the University worked wit h ACC to finalize the planning and construction approval processes and sche duled construction to begin in May 2010. The primary terms of t he lease were set forth in the MOU. The terms of the MOU contemplate a student housing project consisting of two primary phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 is the only part committed to in this lease. The primary terms of the proposed Lease terms with ACC are as follows: The University will ground leas e property in its designated expansion zone to ACC for a 65 year term with a lessee option to extend the term for two periods of 10 years. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUM AN RESOURCES COMMITTEE FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 2 ACC will design, develop, build and manage student housing on the leased property. Phase 1 will include approximately 874 beds, the majority of which will be substantially complete and ready for occupancy for the Fall 2011 semester. ALL the improvements will, at all times, be owned by the University, but leased to ACC. ACC will make semi-annual ground lease payments to the University. These rent payment s are a percentage of the ACC gross revenues and as such will va ry based upon actual rents (assumes property is tax-exempt1.) ACC's construction cost savings, if any, will be shared with the University. The University will receive additiona l rent if the project revenues exceed expectations via a formula for sharing in this \"upside participation.\" ACC must construct the project to the standards agreed to in the MOU (Outline specifications and concept plans). The University agrees not to build competin g housing unless a study shows reasonable demand and the new housi ng will not adversely impact the ACC project. ACC will be responsible for all ma intenance, operation and upkeep of the facility to a \"Class A Standard.\" ACC will operate the pr oject pursuant to University student residential life program standards. The University will agree to make available adequate parking commensurate with the needs of the University and the project at costs commensurate with the relati ve value of the parking needed. IMPACT The primary benefit of a public-private partnership for on-campus housing for Boise State University is the ab ility to reserve debt capacity for construction of academic and research facilities while meeting the immediate need for on- campus student housing. The University would also reap the benefit of ACC's experience constructing, owning and managing high-quality student housing communities. Since ACC is required to finance this pr oject with their own equity, there is no debt on the project that can be attri buted to the University. In recent conversations with representatives fr om Moodys and Standard & Poors, they have verbally indicated t hat the project costs woul d not be considered the University's direct debt. However, they will continue to monitor this project and any potential impact it could have on the Univer sity's overall credit quality. In the unlikely event that the pr oject is unsuccessful or ACC were to default, the University's subsequent involvement in the project could cause the rating 1 ACC and the University intend that the land, improvements and equipment that comprise this project be treated as property of the State of Idaho for tax purp oses since they are owned by the University and are put to education purposes, i.e. st udent housing. Should the Ada County Assessor or other tax authority determine otherwise, the University will oppose such action. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUM AN RESOURCES COMMITTEE FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 3 agencies to reassess their credit position. However, if that unlikely scenario were to occur, the University would st ill have the housing community, a viable institutional asset. Potential drawbacks of a long term ground lease include the University's loss of control of leased land for an extended period of time and reputational costs associated with an unsuccessful project. Additionally, expected financial gains may not materialize if those gains are tied to the success of a project that doesn't meet expectations. An updated summary of the financial impa ct of the Phase I project in January 2010 as compared to the information pr esented at the June 2009 Board meeting is presented as attachment 1.

[ACC TO CONFIRM] 19. Condemnation . In the event that the entire Leased Premises, or any part thereof, is taken or condemned for a public or quasi-public us e or that after any partial taking the remaining portion of the Leased Premises is not sufficien t, in Lessee's reasonable judgment, for the successful operation of the Project, Lessee shall have the right, with the written approval of the Lead Leasehold Mortgagee (if there is then a L easehold Mortgage), to terminate this Lease by written notice thereof to Lessor, in which event both parties shall be re lieved of and from any liability hereunder, except those acc rued up to the time of such term ination. In the event of any ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 38 temporary taking or condemnation, Lessee shall be entitled to the en tire award of the condemning authority and there shall be no reduction in Rent. In the event th at the entire Leased Premises or any part thereof is permanently taken by condemnation, Lessee and Lessor shall cooperate to prove in ea ch condemnation proceeding the loss in value, by reason of the taking, of the respective estates of Lessor and Lessee (notw ithstanding the termination of this Lease, if any), and Lessor and Lessee shall each be entitled to pursue an award for the values of Lessor's and Lessee's respective interests in the Leased Premises taken in such proceedings, if the condemning authority permits separate awards to be sought by Lessee and Lessor (it being acknowledged that in all events Lessee shall be entitled to receive any value attributable to the Improvements, less any amounts paid by Lessor pursu ant to Section 17.1.5 of this Lease). In the event that the condemning author ity does not permit separate awar ds to be sought by Lessee and Lessor, then all proceeds and awards which may be payable as a result of condemnation shall, following their receipt by Lessee or any Leasehol d Mortgagee, be distributed in the following order of priority: 19.1 There shall first be paid to any Leasehold Mortgagees such amounts as may be required by such mortgages to be paid to such Mortgagees, in order of priority. 19.2 From the amount remaining, if any, there shall then be paid to Lessee a sum equal to the costs incurred by Lessee or any Leas ehold Mortgagee in connection with collection of such proceed s and awards (including, without limitation, all fees for experts, counsel fees, costs of surveys and appraisals, a nd court costs), and, in the event of a partial taking which does not result in the termination of this Lease, a sum equal to the costs incurred or to be incurred by Lessee in rest oring the portion of the Leased Pr emises remaining to a condition as nearly as possible to that in which the Leased Premises were prior to such taking, in the light of any reduced area thereof, pursuant to a procedure reasonably satis factory to any Lead Leasehold Mortgagee. 19.3 The amount remaining, if any, shall be divided between Lessor and Lessee in an amount proportionate to the fair market value of Lesso r's and Lessee's estates in the Leased Premises. Such fair market value is to be determined in accord ance with the standards and principles applicable generally in condemnati on proceedings before the courts of the State of Idaho and in accordance with the terms of this Leas e. The said sum equal to the fair market value of the respective estates shall be based on the determination of the c ondemning authority, board of review or court which shall have determin ed the amount of proceeds and awards received by Lessee and Lessor, provided that such determin ation shall have set forth an apportionment between the leasehold estate of Lessee, on one hand, and the Le ssor's estate in the Leased Premises, on the other hand. The parties hereby request such condemning authority, board of review or court to make such determination pursuant to this S ection 19.3 and hereby consent to such determination. In the abse nce of such determination relative to such apportionment, upon written request by either Lessor or Lessee (an \"Appraisal Request \"), the apportionment shall be determined by appraisal in accordance with the procedures specified in Exhibit D . The decision of such appraisal process shall be binding upo n the parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, regard less of the manner in which the proportionate values of the Lessor's and the Lessee's estates are determined, Lessee's award shall be reduced by all amounts ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 39 paid to Leasehold Mortgagees. If the amount paid to the Leasehold Mortgagees exceeds the fair market value of Lessee's estate in the Leased Premises as de termined above (the \"Lessee's FMV \"), then the remainder, if any, of the cond emnation proceeds and awards shall be paid to Lessor. If the amount paid to the Leasehold Mort gagees is less than the Lessee's FMV, then the remainder, if any, of the condemnation proceeds and awards shall be paid as follows: (i) first, to Lessor in any amount that, when compared to the amount paid to the Leasehold Mortgagees, equals the same proportion of award to the fair market value of Lessor's estate as determined above (the \"Lessor's FMV \") as that proportion determined by comparing the payment to the Leasehold Mortgagees to Lessee's FMV, and (ii) second, the remainder, if any, pari passu, until fully paid, in the same proportion as the fair mark et value of each party's estate in the Leased Premises or this Lease, as the case may be, comp ares to the total fair market value of Lessee's FMV and Lessor's FMV. In the event that the entire L eased Premises, or any part thereof, is ta ken or condemned, and Lessee does not terminate this Lease as a result thereo f, then Rent shall be reduced as of the date of such taking or condemnation to equal the product of (a) the Rent in effect prior to such taking or condemnation, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of tenantable square feet contained within th e Improvements remaining after such taking or condemnation and the denominator of which is th e number of tenantable square feet contained within the Improvements prior to such taking or condemnation. 20. Leasehold Mortgages . 20.1 Right to Mortgage . Lessee may, at its option, fo llowing that date which is two (2) years after the Op ening Date, mortgage, or otherwise lien, pledge, assign or secure its leasehold interest in the Project to secure borrowi ngs of Lessee or its Affiliates in the event and to the extent that a Rating Determination (hereina fter defined) has been i ssued. As used herein, the term \"Rating Determination \" shall mean preliminary indications by Moody's Investor's Service and Standard & Poor's that such borr owings by Lessee or its Affiliates will not be included in the calculation of direct or indirect debt of University. ACC will pursue the Rating Determination at its cost and Lessor agrees, at Lessee's request, to cooperate with Lessee and use its reasonable good faith efforts to obtain a Rating Determination. Following that date which is two (2) years after the Opening Date, provided that a Rating De termination has been issued, then thereafter on one or more occas ions Lessee and every successor and assignee of Lessee shall have the right to enter into one or more Leasehold Mortgage s and assign this Lease as security for such Leasehold Mortgage; pr ovided, however, that the amount of the Loan secured by such Leasehold Mortgages, in the a ggregate, shall not exce ed an amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the then fair market value of the Leased Premises as of the time such Leasehold Mortgage is executed, as reason ably determined by the applicable Leasehold Mortgagee. Lessee shall not pl ace or create any Mortgage or other lien or encumbrance purporting to affect Lessor's fee inte rest in the Leased Premises or Lessor's interest in this Lease. 20.2 Notice to Lessor . Within fifteen (15) days after the execution of any Leasehold Mortgage, Lessee shall provide Lessor with a true and correct copy of such Leasehold Mortgage. In the event of any amendment to or modification of any Leas ehold Mortgage, a copy thereof shall be provided to Lessor within fiftee n (15) days after the execution thereof. Such ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 40 notice shall remain effective for so long as such Leasehold Mortgage shall remain unsatisfied of record or until written notice of satisfaction of such Leasehold Mortgage is given by the Leasehold Mortgagee to Lessor. Lessor shall promptly upon receipt of a communication under this Section 20 acknowledge in writing receipt of said communication to Lessee and such Leasehold Mortgagee as satisfying the requirements of this Section 20 , or, in the alternative, reject in writing said notice as not comply ing with the provisions of this Section 20 and specify the specific grounds for such rejection. In the event that Lessor shall fail to reject any such notice on or before fifteen (15) days after the re ceipt by Lessor of such notice, such notice shall be deemed to have satisfied th e requirements of this Section 20 . In the event of any assignment of a Leasehold Mortgage or in the event of a ch ange of address of a Leasehold Mortgagee or of an assignee of such Leasehold Mortgage, noti ce of the new name and/or address shall be provided to Lessor. Any notice to be given by Le ssor to a Leasehold Mortgagee pursuant to any provision of this Section 20 shall be deemed properly addre ssed if sent to the Leasehold Mortgagee at the address indicated in the most recent notice sent with respect to the Leasehold Mortgage pursuant to this Section 20 . Notices from the Leasehold Mortgagee to Lessor shall be mailed to the address designated pursu ant to the provisions of Section 29 hereof. Such notices, demands and requests shall be given in the manner described in Section 29 and shall in all respects be governed by the pr ovisions of th at section. 20.3 Designation of Lead Leasehol d Mortgagee: Amendment Requires Approval . Lessee shall designate one Leasehold Mort gagee as the \"Lead Leasehold Mortgagee\" by notice to Lessor in accord ance with this Section 20 . In no event shall there be more than one Lead Leasehold Mortgagee at any one time. Lessee shall have the right, from time to time during the Lease Term, to change the designated L ead Leasehold Mortgagee by notice to Lessor; provided that such change in designation shall not be effectiv e without the consent of such outgoing Lead Leasehold Mortgagee, unless the lien of its Leasehold Mortgage has been satisfied of record or it otherwise gives notice of satisfaction. This L ease shall not be amended, cancelled, surrendered or rejected by Lessee without the prior wr itten approval of the Lead Leasehold Mortgagee, and any such action done without the consent of Lead Leasehold Mortgagee shall not bind Lead Leasehold Mortgage e or adversely affect its rights hereunder, except with respect to a te rmination under Sections 20.5 or 20.6 herein. 20.4 Default Notice . Lessor, upon providing Lessee any notice of default under this Lease or a termination of th is Lease, shall at the same time provide a copy of such notice to the Lead Leasehold Mortgagee and each other Le asehold Mortgagee that has given Lessor notice of its Leasehold Mortgage; provided that Lessor sh all not at any time be required to give notice to more than the Lead Leasehold Mortgagee and two additional Leasehold Mortgagees. No such notice by Lessor shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until a copy thereof has been so provided to such Leasehold Mortgagees of which Lessor has received written notice in the manner specified herein. After such no tice has been given to the Lead Leasehold Mortgagee, such Lead Leasehold Mortgagee shall have an additional ninety (90) day period for remedying any default or causing the same to be remedied as is given Lessee; provided that such ninety (90) day period shall begin when Le ssor delivers a subsequent written notice to the Lead Leasehold Mortgagee after the period of time given to Lessee to remedy, commence remedying or cause to be remedied the defaults specified in any such notice has expired in accordance with the terms and provisions of this L ease; provided, however, that in the event that ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 41 any such nonmonetary default is not susceptible to cure by Lead Leasehold Mortgagee until Lead Leasehold Mortgagee can gain possession of the Leased Premises, Lead Leasehold Mortgagee's period of time to commence to cure such defa ult shall be extended un til such time as Lead Leasehold Mortgagee gains possession of the L eased Premises, so long as (a) during such extended cure period all payments of Rent are pa id as required under this Lease (subject to the notice and cure provisions set forth in this Lease) and (b) Lead Leasehold Mortgagee is reasonably diligent in its efforts to gain possession of the Leased Premises. Lessor shall accept such performance by or at the instigation of such Lead Leasehold Mortgage e as if the same had been done by Lessee. Lessee authorizes Lead L easehold Mortgagee to ta ke any such action at Lead Leasehold Mortgagee's option in accordance with law and the terms and conditions of this Lease and does hereby authorize entry upon th e Leased Premises by the Lead Leasehold Mortgagee for such purpose. 20.5 Notice to Lead Leasehold Mortgagee .

BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 2 BACKGROUND/ DISCUSSION In 2006, the University in itiated a Technical Assessment & Feasibility Study of a proposed Events Pavilion and of the ASUI Kibbie Activity Center (KAC). A team of consultants headed by Opsis Architec ture and Hastings-Chivetta conducted a technical evaluation of the facility and identified a series of life safety improvements necessary for the KAC. The University is currently proceeding with these life safety improvements. Installation of a new turf play surface in the KAC was authoriz ed by the Board in April of 2007 and the installation was completed in Septem ber of 2007. The initial phase of construction of Life Safe ty Improvements to include replacement of the west end wall, installation of fi re detection and suppression systems in the interstitial roof truss space and additi onal west end fiel d level egress was authorized by the Board in De cember of 2008. That in itial phase of Life Safety Improvements is currently in constructi on and estimated for completion in March of 2010. The replacement of the west wall portion of the project was completed in August of 2009 and has not only im proved safety in the Dome, it has transformed the characte r of the Dome. In addition to the on-going Li fe Safety Improvements, the Technical Assessment & Feasibility Study recommended a further series of amenity renovations intended to give a 'face-lift' to the 35 ye ar old facility, enhancing the functionality of the facility, and improving spectato r comfort through concession and seating upgrades. These amenity renovations are separate and distinct from the Life Safety Improvements, and, they are to be funded by a separate source of developed and gifted funds. Overall Project Description The ASUI Kibbie Activity Center (KAC) Enhancements Project consists of the following elements: Construction of a new Media and Game Operati ons Box to be located above the north concourse and seating area of the Kibbie Dome. Conversion of the existing Media and Game Operations Box currently located above the south concourse s eating area of the Kibbie Dome. This existing structure will be exp anded and renovated to serve as a Club Level in support of enhanced sp ectator seating opportunities Construction of Suite-Style Seati ng Boxes to be located on the south concourse/seating area Construction of Club Seating ar eas to be located on the south concourse/seating area. Additional Miscellaneous improv ements aimed at enhancement of spectator comfort and upgraded seatin g in the ASUI Kibbie Activity Center. The University has worked diligently over the course of the pas t year to identify and refine the improvements and enhancements necessary to achieve the goals BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 3 and intent of the Technical Assessment & Feasibility Study in the most efficient and achievable manner. This currently proposed scope is much reduced and much more efficient than originally envisione d. This allows the University to meet the goals and intents of the original vision while prov iding much greater value to our stakeholders. Relocation of the media and game m anagement operations to a new location above the north concourse will allow a purpose-built space supporting these needs that is fully compliant with the functional needs of the media, coaching and facility management staffs in a code comp laint and fully accessible facility. This relocation further frees up the sout h side concourse and st ructures to be expanded and renovated, creating enhanced seating o pportunities and spectator comfort facilities on par wit h current state of the art, spectator venues and arenas. Location of these facilities on the south concourse allows a versatility of use in support of a variety of events, to include the Lionel Ha mpton International Jazz Festival, varsity football, varsity men's and women's basketball, regional and community events, etc. The total Capital Project Cost to include design, construction and associated soft costs for this series of enhancement s and improvements is $5,310,000. The Design Phase cost to include architectu ral fees, survey costs, plan check fees and other associated miscellaneous costs for this effort is estimated at $671,000. Current Authorization Request With this item, the University seeks aut horization for the Design Phase in the amount of $671,000. The University intends to pr oceed with Design only at this time and return to the Board at a later date with a request for construction authorization dependent upon successful fund rais ing efforts. This project directly supports the Univer sity's strategic plan and its education and outreach goals. It is fully consistent with the stated goal s and intents of the Technical Assessment & Feasibility Study for the ASUI Kibbie Activity Center (as described both herein and to the Board in previous presentations), the University's Long Range Campus Deve lopment Plan (LRCD P), and the Campus Infrastructure Master Plan. The KAC is an iconic structure which serves a wide variety of campus and community needs, supporting general education, recreational, athletic, and co mmunity events. It also serves as a staging and response center in regional emergencies. IMPACT The Immediate fiscal impact of this effort is $671,000.

A team of consultants headed by Opsis Architecture and Hastings-Chivetta conducted a technical evaluati on of the facility and identifi ed a series of life safety improvements necessary fo r the Kibbie Dome. The University is currently proceeding with these life safety improvements. Installation of a new turf play surface in the Kibbie Dome was authorized by the Board in April of 2007 and the installation was completed in September of 2007. The initial phase of construction of Li fe Safety Improvements to include replacement of the west end wall, installation of fire detection and suppression systems in the interstitial roof truss space and additional west end field level egress was authorized by the Boar d in December of 2008. The initial phase of Life Safe ty Improvements is currently substantially complete. It, along with a parallel effort by the St ate of Idaho, is estimated for final completion in March of 2010. The replacement of the west wall portion of the project was successfully completed in Au gust of 2009 and has not only improved safety in the Kibbie Dome, it has trans formed the very character of the Kibbie Dome. Summary of Project Activity to Date In December of 2007, the Board authoriz ed the University to expend up to $2,000,000 to implement the design phase for the ASUI Ki bbie Activity Center (Kibbie Dome) Life Sa fety Improvements. Subsequent to the Board's authorization to implement the design phase for the Kibbie Dome Life Safety Improvements, the University issued a Request for Qualifications for A/E Services. A team of consultants headed by Opsis Architecture, Hastings-Chivetta and Lombar d Conrad Architects of Boise, Idaho was selected from a field of four candidate consulting teams in February of 2008. Beginning in April of 2008, the University and the desi gn team held a series of meetings with representatives of the St ate Division of Build ing Safety (DBS) and the State Fire Marshal to establish and ve rify goals and objectives for the project, and to ensure that all stakeholders were working towards a common end. The design team developed accurate foundational information needed upon which to base solid design decisions. This information was presented to the University in September of 2008 and to DBS and the State Fire Marshal in October of 2008. The design team then prepared design and bidding document s for the Life Safety Improvements measures agreed to by all parties and prioritized in consultation with DBS and the Fire Marshal. In addition , the Life Safety subconsultant, Rolf BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 4 Page 3 Jensen Associates, prepared a computer generated, state-of-the-art fire and smoke model and a NFPA 101 Compliant Li fe Safety Analysis as requested by and agreed upon by DBS and the Fire Marshal. This was presented to all parties in early 2009. In addition, the University published a Requ est for Qualifications for Construction Management Services in October of 2008. A team headed by Walsh Construction Company of Portland, Orego n was selected from a field of three qualified candidate firms in December 2008. In December of 2008, the University approached the Board wi th a request to pursue the project via a phased implemen tation. This phased approach was necessitated by limitations on the University's ability to develop funds via a bond issue that arose as a result of the general c ondition of the econom y at the time. The University stated that it had re viewed this phased approach and strategy with both DBS and the State Fire Marshal. Both DBS and the State Fire Marshal were in agreement that a phased stra tegy made sense given the economic conditions and supported the University's approach. The Board approved the Initial Construction Phase. Following the Board of R egents Authorization in December of 2008, the University gave direction to the design and construction management teams to develop and proceed with the bidding of an initial construction package with an estimated total construction cost, to incl ude contingencies, of $10,000,000. This package was in alignment with the University's initial construction funding package and the Regents' Authorization. Construction on this initial phase began in earnest in March of 2009 upon the conclusion of the Lionel Hampton Inte rnational Jazz Festival. The scope centered on the removal and replacement of the west end wall. The replacement of the west end wall was su ccessfully completed in A ugust of 2009 in sufficient time to host the fall 2009 varsity football season. Further scope items included installation of aisle handrails, the additi on of west end field level exits and a northeast exit stair case, which continued through fall and wint er of 2009. The scope of this initial phase of construction is now substantially complete. In the summer of 2009, the University l earned that the State of Idaho was able to fund a separate, complementary Life Safe ty Improvements proj ect via the State Permanent Building Fund (PBF). The scope of the State project is coordinated with the University funded proj ect and includes sprinklering in the roof interstitial space, improvements to the fire detect ion and alarm systems, and standby power generation. The State funded project is currently underway and is scheduled for completion in March of 2010. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 4 Page 4 Current Authorization Request At the time of the request for the initia l phase of construction, the University indicated that it intended to proceed with the initial phase of construction, and return to the Board for additional aut horization on the remaining scope as financing conditions would allow. Accordingly, the University is now requesting additional construction authorization of the Board to complete the final phase of construction as outlined in previous presentations and as described above. The major element of work in this final phase is replacement of t he east end wall and the installation of associated systems such as the east sm oke evacuation fans, related controls, sprinklering of the east end wall, and va rious remaining miscellaneous items. The replacement of the east end wall with non-combusti ble construction is much more complicated than the replacement of the west wall. There is a need to coordinate with operat ions and occupants of the Vand al Athletic Center, and take measures necessary to protect those o ccupants from construction operations, including possible relocation of some o ccupants. In addition , there are many more building systems that tie together through the east wall and which were not present in the west wall. Scoreboards, video screens , and the like are located on the east wall. Fire detection and al arm systems, and building control and communications systems tying the north conc ourse to control centers located in the south concourse are all served by cables and conductors that run through conduit and chases located in the east wall. Scaffolding and hoisting operations are much more complex in regard to the east wall than they were with the west, again due to the presence of t he Vandal Athletic Center. It is the intent of the University and the design and construction management teams to apply the knowledge gained and lessons learned from the replacement of the west wall to the more comple x replacement of the east end wall and associated system and scope. Based on th e west wall experience, and given the additional complexities present with th e replacement of the east wall, the University estimates this final ph ase of constructi on at $11,000,000. Therefore, this current authorization r equest is for an additional construction phase of $11,000,000 to include replacem ent of the east end wall with non- combustible construction, completi on of the smoke ev acuation system, associated fire detection alarm and su ppressions systems, additional roof ballasting, and other miscellaneous item s as identified as the Technical Assessment & Feasibility Study and agreed to by DBS and the State Fire Marshal. This authorization request is in additi on to the existing $2,000,000 design phase authorization and $10, 000,000 initial construction phase authorization currently in place, and will bring the total pr oject authorization to $23,000,000.

BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 2 APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governi ng Policies & Procedures, Section V.F. Title 33 Chapter 38, Idaho Code (Hig her Education Bond Act) BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Overview of proposed bonds The University proposes issuing four series of bonds as follows: Series 2010A Refunding Project Series 2010A Bonds to be used to re fund the University's Student Fee Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 1996 (\" Activity Center Bonds \") in the aggregate principal amount of $3,125,000 and the Student Fee Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 1997B current ly outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $7,290,000. Series 2010B Project Series 2010B Bonds to be used to pay off the loan from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which financed the initial phase of life safety improvements to the Kibbie Dome of the University - replacement of the west end wall, installation of fire detection and suppressi on systems in the interstitial roof truss space and additional west end field level egress. Series 2010C Projects Taxable Series 2010C Bonds to be used to fund the Additional Phase of life safety and code improvements to the Kibbie Dome. These bonds will take advantage of the \"B uild America Bonds\" cl assification and the University will receive tax credit pay ments equal to 35% of the interest payable by the University. Series 2011 Refunding Project Series 2011 Bonds to be issued to prov ide funds sufficient to refund all of the Series 2007A Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $62,095,000. The Series 2011 B onds are being offered and will be delivered on a forward delivery basis. The University will utilize a forward purchase bond sale agreement (\"FPA\") refunding of the 2007A Bonds to capture current low interest rates in early 2010 for actual delivery of the refunding bonds to investors on April 1, 2011. The Series 2011 Refunding allows the University to lock in current low rates to fix the rate on the Series 2007A bonds beyond the balloon date of April, 2011. In a FPA bond refunding, bond investors agree to purchase the University's refunding bonds now , for bond settlement on April 1, 2011. The principal adverse consideration for the University proceeding with a refunding now would be that interest rates in 2011 might be lower than the pricing of the Se ries 2010 refunding bonds in the current market. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 3 2010 Supplemental Resolution The 2010 Supplemental Re solution authorizes issuance of the Series 2010A, 2010B, 2010C and 2011 Bonds for the purposes outlined above. The 2010 Supplemental Reso lution also authorizes an Escrow Agreement with respect to the Activity Center Bonds (the \" Series 2010A Escrow Agreement \") with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. , as Escrow Agent (the \" Escrow Agent \"). The 2010 Supplemental Resolution and the Series 2010A Escrow Agreement provide for the purchase of direct obligations of the United States to be deposited along with an existing cash balance of $10,000, 000 into an escrow account (the \" Series 2010A Escrow Account \") to pay the current inte rest and redemption price on the Activity Center Bonds upon call fo r redemption on their first call date. The 2010 Supplemental Reso lution also authorizes an escrow agreement with respect to the Series 2007A Bonds (the \" Series 2011 Escrow Agreement \"). The 2010 Supplemental Resolution and the Series 2011 Escrow Agreement provide for the purchase of direct obligat ions of the United States to be deposited along with an existing cash balance in to the escrow account (the \" Series 2011 Escrow Account \") to pay the current interest and redemption price on the Series 2007A Bonds upon call for redempt ion on their first call date. Rate, Maturities Security and Ratings Interest rates will be determined at pricing however the bond market is currently in a very favorable position for these issuances. The 2010 bond series will be fixed rate to maturity. The 2011 refunding bond will continue the multi-modal conc ept begun in 2007 and be fixed for ten years, with the same final maturity as the original 2007 bond. Specific maturities are as follows: a) Series 2010A Maturity: Ma tch-maturity refunding (Series 1996 Final Maturity: April 1, 2013; Series 1997B Final Maturity: May 15, 2016) b) Series 2010B Maturity: Final Maturity: April 1, 2033. c) Series 2010C Final Maturity: April 1, 2041 d) Series 2011 Maturity: balloon ma turity in 2021; final maturity at 4/1/2041 All bond series will be i ssued as part of the General Revenue Bond System and secured by pledged revenues to include student fees, sales and service revenues from auxiliary enterprises and educational activities, revenues received for facility and adminis trative cost recove ry in conjunction with grants and contracts, various miscellaneous revenues, and certain investment income. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's each have affirmed UI's ratings of \"A1\" and \"A+\" respec tively with stable outlook. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 4 IMPACT The University has already realized sa vings of approximat ely $5 million in reduced interest costs from the 2007 seri es bonds which utilized multi-modal bonds initial fixed terms of 4.5 years (Series 2001A) and 10.5 years (Series 2007B). The University now has the opportuni ty to lock in today's low rates to fix the rate on the Series 2007A bonds bey ond the balloon date of April, 2011. Refunding now would take interest rate risk off the table well be fore the April 1, 2011 balloon date. The current interest rate market suggests the University could lock in an all-in-cost of capital in the mi d 5% range for a 10 year extension of the Series 2007A bonds with a balloon in 2021. The University needs to refinance the curr ent $10 million debt to Wells Fargo and in light of the favorable interest rate market sees this as an opportunity to complete the important life safe ty project for the Kibbie Dome. The University's ten year debt projecti ons (Attachment 1) shows the projected debt service needs and the projected debt service sources from Facility Fees with respect to the proposed bonds.

The issuance for the 2010 Ki bbie projects and the refundi ng of the series 1996 and 1997B bonds would total $31,415,000, and the 2011 project refunding of the 2007A bonds would total $62,095,000 fo r a grand total of $93,510,000. Historically low rates would allow the UI to realize significant reduced interest costs. In addition, the bonds to be us ed for the final phase of life-safety improvements to the Kibbie Dome take advantage of the Build America Bond program under the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Under this new financing tool, the issuer receiv es a direct federal subsidy payment for a portion of their borrowing costs on Build America Bonds equal to 35% of the total BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 5 interest paid to investors. As a resu lt of this federal subsidy payment, the University will realize a lower net borrowin g cost. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's each have affirmed UI's ra tings of \"A1\" and \"A+\", respectively. Staff recommends approval. BOARD ACTION A motion to approve the request by the Un iversity of Idaho for a Supplemental Resolution for the Series 2010A, 2010B , 2010C, and 2011 Bonds, the title of which is as follows: A SUPPLEMENTAL RESOLUTION of t he Regents of the University of Idaho authorizing the iss uance and sale of (i) G eneral Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2010A, in the principal amount of up to $13,000,000 (the \"Series 2010A Bonds\"); (ii) General Revenue Bonds, Series 2010B, in the principal amount of up to $12,000, 000 (the \"Series 2010B Bonds\"); (iii) Taxable General Revenue Bonds, Series 2010C (Issuer Subsidy-Build America Bonds), in the principal amount of up to $16,000,000 (the \"Series 2010C Bonds\"); and (iv) Adjustable Ra te General Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2011, in the principal amount of up to $67,000,000 (the \"Series 2011 Bonds\" and collectively with the Series 2010A Bonds, the Series 2010B Bonds, and the Series 2010C Bonds, the \"Series 2010/11 Bonds\"), authorizing the executi on and delivery of Bond Purchase Agreements related to the Series 2010/11 Bonds, and providing for other matters relating to the authorization, issuance, sale and payment of the Series 2010/11 Bonds.

See \"THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS - Generally.\" ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 20 Interest Rates and Payments The Adjustable Rate Bonds w ill initially bear interest at an Initial Term Interest Rate (as shown on the inside cover page of this Official Statement) during the Initial Term Interest Rate Period (as shown on the inside cover page of this Official Statement). The in terest on the Adjustable Rate Bonds during the Initial Term Interest Rate Period will be payable on each Ap ril 1 and October 1, commencing April 1, 2011.

See \"THE SERIES 2010/20 11 BONDS - Interest Rate Periods,\" \"- Payment of Interest,\" and \"- Interest Rate Determination for Adjustable Rate Bonds.\" There will be no Liquidity Facility available to pay for Adjustable Rate Bonds to the ex tent that, upon tender on the Conversion Date, the Adjustable Rate Bonds are unable to be remarketed. In such event, the Adjustable Rate Bonds will bear interest to maturity at the interest rate described in \"THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS - Payment of Purchase Price; Adjustable Rate Bonds Deemed Purchased\" and \"- Rema rketing of Mandatory Tender Bonds.\" The Adjustable Rate Bonds will not be subject to mandatory tender prior to their maturity date and, therefore, will not have the benefit of a Liquidity Facility.

See \"THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS - Generally.\" Designation of the Taxable Series 2010C Bonds as \"Build America Bonds\" The Regents have elected to treat the Taxabl e Series 2010C Bonds as \"Build America Bonds\" for purposes of the Federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the \" Federal Recovery Act \") and to receive tax credit payments from the United St ates Department of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Section 6431(b) of th e Internal Revenue Code (the \" Code \"), in an amount equal to thirty- five percent (35%) of the interest payable by the Regents on any Taxable Series 2010C Bonds (each, a \"Direct Payment \"). All Direct Payments, upon their receipt fro m time to time by th e Regents, shall be (i) deposited in the Bond Fund established under the R esolution, (ii) used in paying debt service on the Outstanding Bonds of the Regents, and (iii) incl uded in Pledged Revenues for all purposes under the Resolution. See \"THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS - D esignation of the Taxable Series 2010C Bonds as 'Build America Bonds'.\" However, if for any reason there is a material adverse change to the Code pursuant to which the Direct Payments are reduced or eliminated, the Taxable Series 2010C Bonds will remain outstanding and there will be no extr aordinary optional redemption available to the Regents, notwithstanding the impact of such a change on the Pledged Revenues. See \"SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS.\" Redemption and Tender During the Initial Term Interest Rate Period, the Adjustable Rate Bonds will not be subject to optional or mandatory redemption. The Adjustable Rate Bonds are subject to mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity on the last day of the Initial Term Interest Ra te Period and upon the occurrence of certain events. See \"THE SERIES 2010/2011 BO NDS - Mandatory Tender for Purchase\" and \"- Redemption Prior to Maturity.\" ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 21 The Series 2010A Bonds are not subject to optional redemption prior to maturity. The Series 2010B Bonds and the Taxable Series 2010C Bonds are s ubject to optional redemption and extraordinary redemption prior to their respective maturities under certain circumstances as described in \"THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS - Redemption Prior to Maturity - Optional Redemption\" and \"- Extraordinary Redemption of Series 2010B Bonds and Taxable Se ries 2010C Bonds.\" The Series 2010 Bonds may be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption prior to maturity as described in \"THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS - Redemption Prior to Maturity - Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption.\" Book-Entry System The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (\" DTC \") is acting as securities depository for the Series 2010/2011 Bonds through its nominee, Cede & Co., to which principal and interest payments on the Series 2010/2011 Bonds are to be ma de. One or more fully registered bonds in denominations in the aggregate equal to the princi pal amount per maturity of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds will be registered in the name of Cede & Co. I ndividual purchases will be made in book-entry form only and purchasers of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds will not r eceive physical delivery of bond certificates, all as more fully described herein. Upon receipt of paymen ts of principal and interest, DTC is to remit such payments to the DTC Participants fo r subsequent disbursement to the beneficial owners of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds. For a more complete descripti on of the book-entry system, see \"THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS - Generally.\" For a more complete description of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds and the Resolution and other documents pursuant to which such Series 2010/2011 Bonds are being issued, see \"THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS\" and \"APPENDIX D - SUMMARY OF THE RESOLUTION\" hereto. Payment and Security for the Series 2010/2011 Bonds In connection with the issuance of their Gene ral Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2005A (the \"Series 2005A Bonds \"), the Regents began the process of cr eating a single bond system (the \" General Revenue Bond System \") pursuant to a supplemental resolution adopted in connection with the Series 2005A Bonds (the \" 2005A Supplemental Resolution \") by combining the revenues previously pledged under the Original Resolution with certain other st udent fees and revenues it had previously pledged as security on a stand-alone basis to other bond systems and certain previously unpledged student fees and revenues. The Regents' strategy in creating th e General Revenue Bond System was to enhance the security and source of payment for all of its bondholde rs, while increasing its financial flexibility, but still maintaining accountability for individual enterprises throug h internal financial policies. To facilitate the creation of the General Revenue Bond System, th e Regents covenanted in the 2005A Supplemental Resolution that it would not issue bonds under its other existing bond systems. The Series 2010/2011 Bonds are being issued as part of the General Re venue Bond System and under the Resolution. See \"SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS.\" The Series 2010/2011 Bonds are secured by the Pl edged Revenues as defined in the Resolution (as further described herein, the \" Pledged Revenues \"). The lien of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds on the Pledged Revenues is on a parity with the lien there on of the Bonds previously issued by the Regents under the Resolution. Following refunding of th e Series 1997B Bonds and the Series 2007A Bonds, the Bonds will be Outstanding in the aggregate principa l amount of $72,475,000.* In connection with the creation of the General Revenue Bond System, the 2005A Supplemental Resolution amended the * Preliminary, subject to change ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 22 Resolution to add to the Pledged Revenues University revenues which were the subject of a prior pledge to the Regents' Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds a nd Recreation Center Bonds (as hereafter defined). See \"SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS - Pl edged Revenues.\" Therefore, the lien of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds on certain of the Pledged Re venues is subordinate to this prior pledge until all Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds and Recreation Cent er Bonds are paid. As of the date hereof, the Recreation Center Bonds are no longer outstanding. The Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds are expected to be refunded in whole with proceeds of the Series 2010A Bonds. See \"PLAN OF FINANCE\" and \"SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY - Schedule of Outstanding Indebtedness\" for the list of Outstanding bonds of the Regents as of December 31, 2009, including the Bonds and the Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds. Under the Resolution, the University has covenanted to establish and collect in each Fiscal Year Pledged Revenues equal to not less than 100% of the Maximum Annual Debt Service on any Outstanding Bonds and any Additional Bonds th at may hereafter be issued. See \"SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS.\" The Regents have appointed We lls Fargo Bank, N.A., to serve as Trustee, bond registrar, authenticating agent, paying agent and transfer agent (the \" Trustee \") with respect to the Series 2010/2011 Bonds. Availability of Continuing Disclosure Upon delivery of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds, the Regents and the Trustee will enter into Continuing Disclosure Agreements in which the Regents will agree, for the benefit of the owners of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds respectively, to file with th e Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board at its Electronic Municipal Market Access system such ongoing information regarding the University as described in \"CONTINUING DISCLOSURE.\" Forward Delivery of Series 2011 Bonds Pursuant to a Forward Delivery Bond Purch ase Contract dated March __, 2010 (the \" Forward Delivery Contract \") between the Regents and George K. Baum & Company (the \" Underwriter \"), the Underwriter has agreed, subject to the terms thereo f, to purchase the Series 2011 Bonds for delivery on or about January __, 2011.

THE FORWARD DELIVERY CONTRACT DOES NOT PERMIT THE UNDERWRITER TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT DELIVERY OF AND PAY FOR THE SERIES 2011 BONDS BECAUSE OF ANY ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE REGENTS OR THE UNIVERSITY, BUT ONLY PERMITS SUCH REFUSAL IF ANY SUCH CHANGE HAS NOT BEEN ACCURATELY AND COMPLETELY DESCRIBED IN THE UPDATED OFFICIAL STATEMENT OR IN A SUPPLEMENT OR AMENDMENT TO THE UPDATED OFFICIAL STATEMENT OR WOULD CAUSE THE REGENTS OR ANOTHER PARTY TO BE UNABLE TO DELIVER ANY OF THE SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTS IN THE FORM AND SUBSTANCE PROVIDED FOR IN THE FORWARD DELIVERY CONTRACT. FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SETTLEMENT, INCLUDING FAILURE OF THE REGENTS TO DELIVER ANY OF THE SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTS IN THE FORM AND SUBSTANCE PROVIDED FOR IN THE FORWARD DELIVERY CONTRACT (UNLESS SUCH FAILURE IS WAIVED BY THE UNDERWRITER), WILL MEAN THAT THE SERIES 2011 BONDS WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND DELIVERED.

It is a condition to the issuance of the Series 2011 Bonds at the Settlement that Co-Bond Counsel delivers its approving opi nion in substantially the form attached hereto as Appendix G . The ability of Co-Bond Counsel to deliver such an opinion at the Settlement is subject to its review and analysis at that time of certain matters, including, among others, the application of the proceeds of the Series 2011 Bonds and pertinent provisi ons of statutes, regulations, rulings and court decisions, including, but not necessarily limited to, stat e law and federal income tax and securities laws then in effect or proposed to be in effect. Co-B ond Counsel has advised the Regents and the Underwriter that, assuming satisfaction by the Regents and the U nderwriter of their respective obligations to be satisfied in the Forward Delivery Contract, and the issuance of the Series 2011 Bonds, and no change in any applicable law, regulations or rulings, or in interpretations thereof, or in any other facts or circumstances (tax or otherwise) which, in Co-Bond Counsel's view, affect or are material to its opinion (including, without limitation, the existence of any litigation), Co-Bond Counsel expects to be able to issue at the Settlement an opinion substa ntially in the form attached hereto as Appendix G .

The purchaser's obligation under its Forward Purchase Letter Agreem ent will be conditioned only upon the Series 2011 Bonds being issued and delivered by the Rege nts and purchased, accepted and paid for by the Underwriter on the Settlement Date as provided for in the Forward Delivery Contract. Events which may occur prior to the Settlement Date may have significan t consequences to persons who have so agreed to purchase Series 2011 Bonds on the Settlement Date. The values of the Series 2011 Bonds of each maturity on the Settlement Date are unlikely to be the sa me as, and in all likelihood will be greater or less than, the purchase prices therefor, and such differences may be substantial. Several factors may adversely ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 26 affect such values including, but not limited to, a ge neral increase or decrease in interest rates for all obligations and other indebtedness, any threatened or adopted change in the federal income tax laws affecting the relative benefits of owning tax-exempt secu rities versus other types of investments, such as fully taxable obligations, or any adverse developmen t with respect to the financial condition of the Regents or the University or with respect to the ra tings of the Series 2011 Bonds. In addition, although the delivery of the opinion of Co-Bond Counsel in substantially the form attached hereto as Appendix G , which is a condition to the issuance and delivery of the Series 2011 Bonds, is subject to a number of conditions to be fulfilled at the time of such deliv ery as described above, changes or proposed changes in federal income tax laws or regulations or interpreta tions thereof could affect the market value of tax- exempt securities generally similar to the Series 2011 B onds without preventing the delivery of the Series 2011 Bonds at the Settlement. THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS This Official Statement provides certain inform ation concerning the Adjustable Rate Bonds during the Initial Term Interest Rate Periods and the Fixed Rate Bonds. The Adjustable Rate Bonds will be subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the last day of the Initial Term Interest Rate Period, and, upon mandatory tender, may be Converted to an other Term Interest Rate Period. Holders and prospective purchasers of the Adjustable Rate Bo nds should not rely on this Official Statement for information concerning the Adjustable Rate Bonds in connection with any Conversion of the Adjustable Rate Bonds to a different Interest Ra te Period, but should look sole ly to the Official Statement or remarketing circular used in connection with any such Conversion.

See \" APPENDIX D - SUMMARY OF THE RESOLUTION - GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE BONDS - Notice of Redemption.\" SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS Pledged Revenues In connection with the creation of the Gene ral Revenue Bond System, the 2005A Supplemental Resolution amended the Resolution to add additiona l University revenues to Pledged Revenues and provided that all Bonds issued under the Resolution be designated as \"General Revenue Bonds.\" The 2005A Supplemental Resolution changed the debt servi ce coverage ratios required to be maintained annually and for the issuance of Additional Bonds. The 2005A Supplemental Resolution also made other changes to the Resolution in light of the transition to the General Revenue Bond System as reflected in \"APPENDIX D - SUMMARY OF THE RESOLUTION.\" To eff ect the Regents' conversion of its then- existing bond system to the General Revenue Bond Sy stem in which all the Series 2005A Bonds and all future Additional Bonds (including the Series 2010/2011 Bonds) would be issued, the Regents covenanted in the 2005A Supplemental Resolution not to issue any additional bonds under the Activity Center Resolution or the Recreation Center Resolution (both as defined below). In conjunction with the additions of revenue sources to Ple dged Revenues, the Regents changed the definitions of the components of Pledged Revenues to match the descriptions of reve nue categories in the University's audited financial statements. The Pledged Revenues which now secure the Se ries 2010/2011 Bonds and the other Outstanding and future Bonds issued under the Resolution incl ude the following student fees and other revenue sources. The pledge of certain such Pledged Revenues to the Bonds is subordinate to the pledge of such revenues to the Outstanding Series 1996 Activity Ce nter Bonds described below, which Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds are expected to be refunded as described in \"PLAN OF FINANCE.\" Pledged Revenues are shown on a pro forma basis for Fiscal Year 2005 (which includes those revenues not pledged in such Fiscal Year) and on a historical basis for Fiscal Years 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 under \"PRO FORMA AND HISTORICAL PLEDGED REVENUES.\" Student Fees (as further described in \"Student Fees\" below), except that the pledge of the Activity Center Complex Fee to pay the Bonds is junior and subordinate to the pledge of such fee under the resolution (the \" Activity Center Resolution \") pursuant to which the Regents issued the Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds currently outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $3,125,000, for so long as any Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds are Outstanding. The Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds are included in the Refunded Bonds, and are not expected to be outstanding following issuance of the Series 2010A Bonds. See \"PLAN OF FINANCE.\" Since the Regents' Student Fee Revenue Bonds (Recreation Center Project), Series 1999 (the \" Recreation Center Bonds \") are no longer outstanding, the pledge of the Recreati on Center Fee to pay the Bonds is no longer junior and subordinate to the pledge of su ch fee under the resolution pursuant to which the Recreation Center Bonds were issued (the \" Recreation Center Resolution \"). Sales and Services Revenues (as further described in \"Sales and Services Revenues\" below), except that the pledge of such revenues to pay the Bonds is junior and ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 34 subordinate to the pledge of the portion of Sales and Service Revenues which consists of the net revenues from the University's non-residential food service facilities (the \" Non- Residential Food Service System \") and net revenues from the University's bookstore, previously pledged under the Activity Center Resolution for so long as any Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds are Outstanding. Certain revenues received by the Univer sity as reimbursement for facility and administrative costs in conjunction with gr ants and contracts for research activities conducted by the University (as further discussed under \"Facilities and Administrative Recovery Revenues\" below, the \" F&A Recovery Revenues \"). Various revenues generated from miscellaneous sources, including fines and lease/rental revenues (as further discussed in \"Other Operating Revenues\" below, the \" Other Operating Revenues \"). Investment Income under the Resolution, except that the pledge of such income is junior and subordinate to the pledge of the portion of Investment Income previously pledged under the Recreation Center Resolution and Activity Center Resolution for so long as any Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds and Recrea tion Center Bonds are Outstanding. The Recreation Center Bonds are no longer outsta nding, and the Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds are included as Refunded Bonds and are not expected to be outstanding following delivery of the Series 2010A Bonds. Direct Payments. See \"THE SERIES 2010/ 2011 BONDS - Designation of the Taxable Series 2010C Bonds as 'Build America Bonds'.\" Proceeds from the sale of a Series of Bonds and moneys and investment earnings thereon, to the extent pledged by the University pursuant to a supplemental resolution. Such other revenues as the Regents shall designate as Pledged Revenues. The following funds and revenues of the University have not been pledged to payment of debt service on the Series 2010/2011 Bonds or other Bonds as part of the Pledged Revenues: general account appropriated funds of the State of Idaho (the \" State \"), which by law cannot be pledged; and restricted gift and grant revenues, includi ng land grant endowments received pursuant to the University's land grant status. See \"SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY\" and \" APPENDIX A - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2009 AND JUNE 30, 2008.\" The revenues pledged to the Series 1996 Activity Ce nter Bonds (as described above) are pledged to the Bonds on a subordinate basis until the retirement of the Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds. Upon the retirement of such Series 1996 Activity Center B onds, such revenues will become pledged on a first lien basis to the Bonds. See definition of \"Pledged Revenues\" in \" APPENDIX C - GLOSSARY OF CERTAIN TERMS USED IN THE RESOLUTION AND OFFICIAL STATEMENT\" attached hereto for a description of the change in the definition of Pledged Revenues when the Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds are retired. The Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds are included as Refunded Bonds as described ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 35 in \"PLAN OF FINANCE\" and are not expected to be outstanding following delivery of the Series 2010A Bonds. The Series 2010/2011 Bonds are li mited obligations of the Regents and do not constitute a debt or liability of the State of Idaho, its Legislature, or any of its political subdivisions or agencies other than the Regents to the extent herein descri bed. The Regents are not authorized to levy or collect any taxes or assessments other than the fees described herein to pay the Series 2010/2011 Bonds. The Regents have no taxing power. Student Fees Under the Idaho Constitution, the Regents cannot charge tuition for Idaho residents attending the University as undergraduate students. However, th e Regents have the ability to establish and collect tuition charges for non-resident, graduate and prof essional students attending the University and to establish and collect student fees from both resident and non-resident students. The Regents are exclusively empowered to establis h student fees and non-resident, graduate and professional tuition. Student fees and tuition charg es are not subject to a referendum by students or approval by any other governmental entity. The Re gents have established a policy that the University may not request more than a 10% annual increase in the total full-time student fees unless otherwise authorized by the Regents. Th e Regents' established policy is to announce and conduct a public hearing on the modification of any fees, which has traditionally occurred annually, with fee adjustments effective for the subsequent fall term each year. The Regent s increased fees by 6.5% at the April 2009 Regents' meeting, which increase became e ffective in the Fall of 2009.

It is approximately 85,500 square feet in size, and includ es more than 7,200 square feet of open recreational space, two regulation-size basketball courts, a mu ltipurpose gymnasium, a large aerobics/cardiovascular multipurpose workout space, a running track, a climbing wa ll, a child care center, a first-aid and athletic training area, classroom and activity spaces, a cafeteria, and space for rental of recreational equipment. Dan O'Brien Track Complex . The Dan O'Brien Track, named in 1996 for University alumnus and 1996 Olympic Decathlon Gold Medalist Dan O'Br ien, was constructed in 1969, and serves as the University's outdoor varsity and recreational track facility. It consists of a 400-meter, 8-lane track, a long jump area, a throwing area, a high jump area, a pole vault area, coaches' offices, and spectator facilities that accommodate approximately 1,000 spectators.

Parking Facilities Currently, the University operates and mainta ins 99 surface parking lots with a total of approximately 6,000 parking spaces. The University h as a comprehensive parking plan to ensure that the parking system is financially self-supporting. Employees and Faculty As of December 31, 2009, the University had 3,208 employees, consisting of 911 faculty, 680 Research Assistants/Teaching Assistants (which are not considered to be part of the faculty) and 1,617 staff and administration. The student to faculty ratio in the Fall of 2009 was 17.2 to 1. Employees are not subject to the State's civil service system; however, the University has adopted a personnel policy with respect to classified employees that is substantially similar to the State's civil service system. The University is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, although there are employee associations that bring any salary issues and concerns to the attention of the University. The University considers its relations with its employees to be good. Employee Retirement Plan; Post Retirement Health Benefits Most employees of the University are eligible for one of two retirement plans: the State of Idaho's \"Public Employees Retirement System of Idaho\" (\" PERSI \") and the \"Optional Retirement Plan\" (\" ORP \"), which has been offered to non-classified employees since 1990. PERSI provides a defined benefit plan and covers eligible classified and exempt personnel who work 20 hours or more per week. The membership of PERSI includes employees of the State of Idaho, teachers, firemen, police and employees of political subdivisions, local school districts, colleges and universities. ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 48 Faculty and exempt staff hired on or after July 1, 1990, have been enrolled in the ORP and faculty and exempt staff hired before that date were offe red a one-time opportunity in 1990 to withdraw from PERSI and join the ORP. The ORP is a portable, defined contribution retirement plan with options offered by Teachers' Insurance and Annuity Associ ation/College Retirement Equities Fund and Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company. The total contribu tion rate will be the same for all employees, with a portion of the employer's contribution for ORP members being credited to the employee's account and a portion to the PERSI unfunded liability until 2015. Th e ORP covers eligible ex empt personnel who work 20 hours or more per week. Based on the audited financial statements for the Fiscal Year 2009, the University had unfunded obligations for post employ ment retirement benefits in Fiscal Year 2009 of $68,808,000. In addition, the University has taken proactive steps to effectively manage and reduce its GASB 45 liability for obligation of post empl oyment benefits (OPEB) related to retiree health. The University's GASB liability was recorded and recognized on its financ ial statements for the first time in Fiscal Year 2008. Program changes which include steeper eligibilit y requirements, retiree cost sharing, integration with Medicare Prescription Drug programs and elimina tion of some future benefits have reduced the Annual Required Contribution (ARC) fr om projections of $28.1 million as fo recast in Fiscal Year 2003 to $6.4 million for Fiscal Year 2009. The University h as fully funded its ARC in each Fiscal Year in accordance with GASB 45. For information concerning post retiremen t health benefits, see NOTE 13, \"POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS AND RETIREE BENEFITS TRUST,\" of \"APPENDIX A - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2009 AND JUNE 30, 2008.\" Insurance The University maintains liability, property, a nd employee fidelity insurance in amounts deemed adequate by University officials. The University has a full-time risk management staff that administers insurance coverage and claims, and reviews the adequ acy of such policies and verifies the University's compliance with insurance requirements imposed by agreements, such as the Resolution. As of December 31, 2009, the total insured replacement va lue of the University's buildings, contents and improvements was approxima tely $1,409 billion. The University began self-funding its medical and dental programs for active employee and retiree health starting July 1, 2005. Self-funding is a financial arrangement in which medical claims are administered by a third-party administrator, but paid directly from University funds instead of by an insurer. The financial risk of the self-funding arrange ment is managed through the creation of a financial reserve established by the University to fund unexpect ed claims and incurred-but-not-reported claims in the event that the self-funding arrange ment is ever terminated. In ad dition, the University's financial exposure for unexpected claims are limited through the purchase of reinsurance (stop-loss coverage) for both individual and aggregate claim liability. Wh en comparing self-funded cost to a fully insured program, the University estimates an approximate savi ngs of $1 million per year in cost under the self- funded health arrangement. The University continues to take a pro-active a pproach to managing the rising cost of health care. In January 2008, the University introduced a consumer-directed high deduc tible plan, programs that create incentives for healthy behaviors, and a cafeter ia or menu of benefit options in a program called \"CustomChoices\". The University believes that th is method of delivery, like a consumer-directed approach and rewards for healthy behaviors, helps foster employee accountability and a partnership in the cost and future cost of health care. ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 49 SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY The University relies on a number of sources of fu nding for the achievement of its educational and research missions. The principal sources of revenues are: direct appropriation of State general account revenues by the Idaho Legislature, Student Fees, federal government appropriations and grants, gifts to the University, Investment Income, revenu es derived from property holdings of the University, land grant endowments received pursuant to the Univ ersity's land grant status, Sales and Service Revenues and Other Revenues. See \" APPENDIX A - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2009 AND JUNE 30, 2008.\" Of these revenue sources, Student Fees, Investment Income, Sales a nd Services Revenues, and Other Revenues are pledged to the Bonds, including the Series 2010/2011 Bonds, except certain of these revenues are pledged on a subordinate basis to the extent such revenues were previously pledged to the Series 1996 Activity Center Bonds (which are included as Refunded Bonds and expected to no longer be outstanding following delivery of the Series 2010A Bonds). See \" SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS\" herein for a description of University revenues pledged to th e Bonds. The University's other revenue sources not constituting Pledged Revenues are more fully discussed below. State Appropriations Legislatively approved State general account appr opriations represent slightly more than 37% percent of the total University budget. The State le gislature meets beginning in January of each calendar year and sets budgets and appropriations for all ag encies and departments of State government for the Fiscal Year beginning on the ensuin g July 1. The legislature may al so make adjustments to budgets and appropriations for the Fiscal Year during which the legislature is meeting. If in the course of a Fiscal Year, the Governor de termines that the expenditures authorized by the Legislature for the current Fiscal Year exceed anticipated revenues expected to be available to meet those expenditures, the Governor by executive order may reduce (\" Holdback \") the spending authority on file in the office of the Division of Financial Management fo r any department, agency, or institution of the State or request a reversion (\" Reversion \") of appropriations back to the Stat e to balance the State budget. If in the course of a Fiscal Year, the Governor determines that the expenditures authorized by the Legislature for the current Fiscal Year exceed anticipated revenues expected to be available to meet those expenditures, the Governor by executive order may reduce (\" Holdback \") the spending authority on file in the office of the Division of Financial Management fo r any department, agency, or institution of the State or request a reversion (\" Reversion \") of appropriations back to the State to balance the State budget. In Fiscal Year 2010 the following holdbacks were applie d: General Education $5,564,900, Ag Research and Extension, Forest Utilization Research, Idaho Geologi cal Survey $1,552,400. An additional mid-Fiscal Year 2010 holdback will be applied in the appr oximate amounts: General Education $1,337,000, Ag Research and Extension, Forest Utilization Rese arch, Idaho Geological Survey, WWAMI Medical Ed. and WI Vet. Science $44,200. In Fiscal Year 2009, the University set aside reserves in the event of holdbacks in Fiscal Year 2010. The table below sets forth the legislative appropr iation from the State General Fund for colleges and universities and for the Univ ersity net of Reversions. ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 50 Schedule of State General Account Appropriations Fiscal Year University of Idaho State Appropriations Total State Appropriations Colleges & Universities Total State General Fund University of Idaho % of Total State General Fund 2010 $ 99,442,400 $257,077,300 Grants and Contracts The United States government and various other pub lic and private sponsoring agencies, through various grant and contract programs, provide a subs tantial percentage of the University's operating revenues. The use of such funds is usually restricted to specific projects. Such revenues include grants and contracts for research, public service, instruction and training programs, fellowships, scholarships, endowment scholarship programs, a nd student aid programs, and grants for construction projects. The University believes it has complied with all material conditions and requirement s of these various grants and contracts. Financial Assistance Financial assistance, primarily in the form of student loans, scholarships, grants, student employment, awards, and deferred paym ents, is available to students. The University believes that the amount of available financial aid is adequate. Du ring the 2008-2009 academic year, the total financial assistance to students received at the University was approximately $98,7 63,289 million, of which approximately $55,050, 637 million was in the form of direct st udent loans. No assurance can be given that the level of assistance available in the past will continue. Federal Appropriations In accordance with the University's designation as a land grant institution, the United States government provides the University with funds for sp ecific programs. Like most federal governmental programs, however, there is no assurance that th ese funds will continue to be appropriated. Land Grant Endowments The University is the State's land grant univers ity, and as such is entitled to revenues from certain State lands. Budget Process/Financial Reports The University operates on an annual budget system. Its Fiscal Year begins July 1 of each year. The budget process, as well as the administration of th e expenditures authorized through the process, is administered through the offices of the President a nd the Vice President for Finance and Administration in collaboration with the departmental faculty and other administrative officers. The internal budget process concludes with a general budget proposal for the following Fiscal Year being submitted in consolidated form by the University administ ration to the Regents in August of each year. ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 51 The University's budget is approved by the Rege nts prior to the commencement of the Fiscal Year, usually at the June meeting. At that meeting, the Regents, in their capacity as members of the State Board of Education, approve the annual budgets for the other institutions of higher education as well. Future Plans The Regents expect to issue Additional Bonds unde r the Resolution in the next two to three years to finance capital projects in various stages of planni ng and the University expects to continue to have a need for maintaining, improving and expanding its capital facilities. Such projects are expected to include renovations of student r ooms and repair of various buildin g sub-systems, modernization of building utility systems to enhance research activiti es in aging science building and renovation of two 1930's buildings for use as a faculty office complex. Sources of funds for these projects include State-appropriated funds, dedicated funds, bonded indebtedness, dona tions and private support.

Interest on the Series 2010A Bonds is not an item of tax preference for purposes of either individual or corporate federal alternative minimum tax (\" AMT \"); however interest on the Series 2010A Bonds held by a corporation (other than an S corporation, regulated investment company, or real estate investment trust) may be indirectly subject to federal alternative mini mum tax because of its inclusion in the adjusted current earning of a corporate holder. Series 2010B Bonds and the Series 2011 Bonds Federal Income Tax In the opinion of Co-Bond Counsel, interest on the Series 2010B Bonds and the Series 2011 Bonds is excludable from gross income for purposes of federal income tax under existing laws as enacted and construed on the date of initial delivery of the Series 2010B Bonds and the Series 2011 Bonds, assuming the accuracy of the certifications of the Rege nts and continuing compliance by the Regents with the requirements of the Code. Interest on the Se ries 2010B Bonds and the Series 2011 Bonds is exempt from individual and corporate federal AMT and is not includable in adjusted current earnings for purposes of corporate AMT. Original Issue Premium Certain of the Series 2010A Bonds, the Series 2010B Bonds, or the Series 2011 Bonds (collectively, the \" Premium Bonds \") may be offered at a premium (\" original issue premium \") over their principal amount. For federal income tax purposes, or iginal issue premium is amortizable periodically over the term of such Premium Bonds through reduc tions in the holder's tax basis for such Premium Bonds for determining taxable gain or loss from sale or from redemption prior to maturity. Amortization of premium does not create a deductible expense or loss. Holders should consult their tax advisors for an explanation of the amortization rules.

Original issue discount on such Discount Bonds accrues as tax-exempt interest pe riodically over the term of such Discount Bonds. The accrual of original issue discount increases th e holder's tax basis in such Discount Bonds for determining taxable gain or loss from sale or from redemption prior to maturity. Holders of such Discount Bonds should consult their tax adviser s for an explanation of the accrual rules.

THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO By: Lloyd Mues, Vice President for Finance and Administration and Bursar ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 60 APPENDIX A FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2009 AND JUNE 30, 2008 ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 61 APPENDIX B SCHEDULE OF STUDENT FEES The fee schedule that follows was approved by th e Regents at the April 2009 meeting for fees to be assessed during the 2009-2010 academic year. The University bases the Estimated Annual Revenue to be collected from each of the fees on budgeting assumpti ons of the student fees approved for the current academic year and the number of full-time and part-time students for the previous academic year. The number of students obtained by dividing the Estimat ed Annual Revenue line items for full-time students is less than the full-time equivalents and fall semest er full time enrollees for Fall 2009 shown in the body of the Official Statement under \"THE UNIVERSITY - Five-Year Historical Enrollment Summary.\" This is consistent with historic budgetin g assumptions, including consideration of the University's policy to provide fee waivers or discounts to certain scholarship recipients and to certain employees and spouses of certain employees. The University's estimates include certain assumptions concerning refunds, late fees and other variables in individual fees, such that the annual estimated revenues of each fee are not the numerical product of the fee rates times a constant number for students paying such fees, but nonetheless represent the University's best estimate of fee revenues.

PAYMENT AGREEMENTS The Resolution authorizes the Regents to enter in to a Payment Agreement and to make a Payment Agreement Payment thereunder on a parity of lien with the payment of the Bonds if the Payment Agreement satisfies the requirements for Additional Bonds described in the Resolution (See \"SECURITY FOR THE SERIES 2010/2011 BONDS - Covenants - Issuance of Additional Bonds \" in the front part of the Official Statement to which this Appendix D is attached for a description of requirements for issuance of Additional Bonds), taking into consideration regularly scheduled Payment Agreement Payments and Receipts (if any) under the Payment Agreement. Th e following shall be conditions precedent to the use of any Payment Agreement on a parity with the Bonds: (i) The University shall obtain an opinion of Bond Counsel on the due authorization and execution of such Payment Agreement, the validity and enforceability thereof and opining that the action proposed to be taken is authorized or permitted by the Resolution or the applicable provisions of any Supplemental Resolution and will not adversely affect the excludability for federal income tax purposes of the interest on any Outstanding Bonds.

The Payment Agreement may oblige the University to pay, on one or more scheduled and specified Payment Agreement Payment Dates, the Paymen ts in exchange for the Payor's obligation to pay or to cause to be paid to the University, on schedul ed and specified Payment Agreement Payment Dates, the Receipts. The University may also enter into Pa yment Agreements that are not reciprocated by the other party to the agreement. If the University enters into a Parity Payment Agreement, Payments shall be made from the Debt Service Account and Annual Debt Service shall incl ude any regularly scheduled University Payments adjusted by any regularly scheduled Receipts during a Fi scal Year. Receipts shall be paid directly into the Debt Service Account. Obligations to make unsche duled payments, such a termination payments, may not be entered into on a parity with the Bonds. To the extent that a Parity Payment Agreement has been designated as a hedge of the interest rate features of either Fixed Rate Bonds or Bonds bearing variable rates of interest, Annual Debt Service during the te rm of such Parity Payment Agreement shall be modified to reflect such Parity Payment Agreement. ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 90 Nothing in the Resolution preclud es the University from entering into Payment Agreements with a claim on Pledged Revenues junior to that of th e Bonds. Furthermore, nothing in the Resolution precludes the University from entering into obligations on a parity with the Bonds in connection with the use of Payment Agreements or similar instruments if the University obtains an opinion of Bond Counsel that the obligations of the University ther eunder are consistent with the Resolution.

Such agreement may or may not be charact erized by a structure of reciprocity of payment. \"Payment Agreement Payment Date \" means any date specified in the Payment Agreement on which a Payment or Receipt is due an d payable under the Payment Agreement. \"Receipt \" means any payment (designated as such by a resolution) to be made to, or for the benefit of, the University under a Payment Agreement by the Payor. \"Payor \" means a Qualified Counterparty to a Payment Ag reement that is obligated to make one or more payments thereunder. \"Qualified Counterparty \" means a party (other th an the University or a party related to the University) who is the other party to a Paymen t Agreement that has or whose obligations are unconditionally guaranteed by a party whose long term de bt is rated \"A\" or higher by Moody's and S&P and who is otherwise qualified to act as the other party to a Payment Agreement under any applicable laws of the State of Idaho.

Rights and Remedies of Registered Owners A. No Registered Owner of any Bond shall ha ve any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Resolution, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy thereunder, unless (1) such Registered Owner has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default; (2) the Registered Owners of not less than twenty-five percent (25%) in principal amount of the Bonds shall have made written request to the Trustee to in stitute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee; (3) such Registered Owners have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses, and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee for sixty (60) days after its receipt of such notice, request, and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceedings; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such wr itten request has been given to the Trustee during such sixty (60) day period by the Registered Owners of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds; it being understood and intended that no one or more Registered Owner of Bond shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of the Resolution to affect, disturb, or prejudice the rights of any other Registered Owner of Bonds, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Registered Ow ner, or to enforce any right under the Resolution, except in the manner provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Registered Owners of Bonds.

ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 96 APPENDIX E DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY INFORMATION The following information concerning DT C and DTC's book-entry-only system has been extracted from a schedule prepared by DTC entitled \"SAMPLE OFFERING DOCUMENT LANGUAGE DESCRIBING BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY ISSUANCE,\" a sou rce that the Regents, the University and the Underwriter believe to be reliable, but the Re gents, the University and the Underwriter take no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. The contents of the DTC website referenced below are not incorporated in this Official Statement by such reference. The Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\"), New Yo rk, NY, will act as securities depository for the Series 2010/2011 Bonds. The Series 2010/2011 Bonds will be issued as fully registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's part nership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. On e fully registered certificate will be issued for each of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds, as set forth on the c over page hereof, each in the aggregate principal amount of each maturity of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds and de posited with DTC. DTC, the world's largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \"banking orga nization\" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System , a \"clearing corporation\" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a \"clear ing agency\" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC's participants (\" Direct Participants \") deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settl ement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants' accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and ce rtain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\" DTCC \"). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation, a nd Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by th e users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as bot h U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (\" Indirect Participants \"). DTC has Standard & Poor's highest rating: AAA. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com and www.dtc.org. Purchases of Series 2010/2011 Bonds under the DTC sy stem must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for th e Series 2010/2011 Bonds on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of Series 2010/2011 Bonds (\" Beneficial Owner \") is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants ' records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which th e Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in Series 2010/2011 B onds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their owne rship interests in Series 2010/2011 Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for a series of Series 2010/2011 Bonds is discontinued. ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 97 To facilitate subsequent transfers, all th e Series 2010/2011 Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are register ed in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of a series of Series 2010/2011 Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of Series 2010/2011 Bonds; DTC's records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts Series 2010/2011 Bonds are credited, whic h may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. As long as the book-entry system is used for Series 2010/2011 Bonds, the Trustee and the Regents will give any notices required to be given to Owners of Series 2010/2011 Bonds only to DTC. Any failure of DTC to advise any Direct Participant, or of any Direct Participant to notify any Indirect Participant, or of any Direct Participant or Indirect Participant to notify any Beneficial Owner, of any such notice and its content or effect will not affect the validity of the action premised on such notice. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants a nd Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any st atutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of noti ces of significant events w ith respect to the Series 2010/2011 Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed am endments to the Resolution. For example, Beneficial Owners of Series 2010/2011 Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Series 2010/2011 Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners, in the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of the noti ces be provided directly to them. Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC as long as it is securities depos itory for the Series 2010/2011 Bonds. If less than all of the Series 2010/2011 Bonds of a single maturity are being redeemed, DTC's practice is to determine by lot the amount of interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed. Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Seri es 2010/2011 Bonds within an issue are being redeemed, DTC's practice is to determine by lot the amount of the in terest of each Direct Par ticipant in such issue to be redeemed. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Series 2010/2011 Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant on accordance with DTC's MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Regents as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Ce de & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Seri es 2010/2011 Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). Principal, premium, if any, and interest paym ents on the Series 2010/2011 Bonds are to be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be re quested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC's practice is to credit Dir ect Participants' accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the Regents or Paying Agent, on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records. Payments by Par ticipants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in \"street na me,\" and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC or its nominee, the Paying Agent or the Regents, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of the Re gents or the Paying Agent; disbursement of such ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 98 payments to Direct Participants shall be the responsib ility of DTC; and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners shall be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. DTC may discontinue providing its services as de pository with respect to the Series 2010/2011 Bonds at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Re gents or the Trustee. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, certificates for the Series 2010/2011 Bonds are required to be printed and delivered. The Regents may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that even t, certificates for the Series 2010/2011 Bonds will be printed and delivered.

The Bonds are being issued pursuant to (i) Title 57, Chapter 5 and Title 33, Chapter 38, Idaho Code, as amended; and (ii) a Resolution, adopted by the Regents on November 22, 1991, as heretofore amended, supplemented, and restated, and as further supplemented and amended by a supplemental resolution of the Regents adopted on February 18, 2010 (collectively, the \"Resolution\"). The Bonds are being issued (i) to provide funds to refund certain outstanding bonds issued by the Regents, (ii) to finance and refinance certain capital improvements of the University of Idaho (the \"University\"), and (iii) to pay costs of issuance associated with the Bonds. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Resolution. Our services as co-bond counsel have been limited to the preparation of the legal proceedings and supporting certificates authorizing the issuance of the Bonds under the applicable laws of the State of Idaho and to a review of the transcript of such proceedings and certificates. As to questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied upon the certified proceedings and other certifications of public officials furnished to us without undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation. Our examination has been limited to the foregoing as they exist or are in effect as of the date hereof.

Based on our examination and the foregoing, we are of the opinion as of the date hereof and under existing laws as follows: ATTACHMENT 10 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 231 DMWEST #7468418 v1 2 1. The Resolution has been duly adopted by the Regents and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Regents enforceable upon the Regents. 2. The Resolution creates a valid lien on the amounts pledged thereunder for the security of the Bonds. 3. The Bonds are valid and binding limited obligations of the Regents, payable solely from the Pledged Revenues and other amounts pledged therefor under the Resolution. 4. Based on an analysis of currently existing laws, regulations, decisions and interpretations, (a) interest on the Series 2010A Bonds is excludable from gross income for purposes of federal income tax under existing laws as enacted and construed on the date of initial delivery of the Series 2010A Bonds, assuming the accuracy of the certifications of the Regents and continuing compliance by the Regents with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"). Interest on the Series 2010A Bonds is not an item of tax preference for purposes of either individual or corporate federal alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\"); however interest on the Series 2010A Bonds held by a corporation (other than an S corporation, regulated investment company, or real estate investment trust) may be indirectly subject to federal alternative minimum tax because of its inclusion in the adjusted current earning of a corporate holder. (b) interest on the Series 2010B Bonds is excludable from gross income for purposes of federal income tax under existing laws as enacted and construed on the date of initial delivery of the Series 2010B Bonds, assuming the accuracy of the certifications of the Regents and continuing compliance by the Regents with the requirements of the Code.

At this time, we are also affirming the A1 rating on the University's outstanding debt (see RATED DEBT at the end of this report). The rating outlook is stable. USE OF PROCEEDS: Series 2010A bond proceeds will be used to refund the Student Fee Revenue Bonds, Series 1996 and 1997B. The Series 2010B and 2010C bonds will be used to finance capital improvements to the Kibbie Dome. The Series 2011 bonds will refund the Series 2007A bonds with a forward purchase agreement, with a settlement date on January 3, 2011 (90 days before the April 1, 2011 tender date). LEGAL SECURITY: The bonds are secured by Pledged Revenues of the University of Idaho which include student fees, auxiliary revenues, facilities, administrative recovery revenues, and direct payments associated with the Build America bonds. In addition, there is an additional bonds test and rate covenant of 1.0 time coverage of annual debt requirements. There is no debt service reserve fund. In FY 2009, Pledged Revenues of $115.3 million plus a Direct Payment of $11,567,305 would provide 10.0 times coverage of maximum annual debt service. DEBT STRUCTURE: The Adjustable Rate General Revenue Bonds, Series 2007A, 2007B, and 2011are issued at a Term Interest Rate with the initial term ending on April 1, 2011, April 1, 2018, and April 1, 2021, respectively. The bonds are subject to a mandatory tender on the effective date of any new Term Interest Rate Period. After the initial period, the University can determine the interest rate period (one, three, six, nine, or twelve months or any multiple of six months). If sufficient funds are not available to pay the purchase price on the bonds, these tendered bonds will bear interest at the Bond Buyer 25 Revenue Bond Index plus 150 basis points to final maturity. The University is not obligated to purchase the tendered bonds and failure to purchase does not constitute an event of default. The Series 2007A and 2007B bonds are secured by a Standby Bond Purchase Agreement provided by Dexia Credit Local (rated A1/P-1) in the event of a failed remarketing, the agreements have stated expiration dates of April 1, 2011 and April 1, 2016 respectively. A short- term rating will not be assigned to the Series 2011 bonds because the ATTACHMENT 11a BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 238initial term is greater than three years. There will not be a Standby Bond Purchase Agreement for the Series 2011 bonds. STRENGTHS * Position as the land-grant and flagship university in the State of Idaho, enrollment of 10,350 full-time equivalent students (FTE) in fall 2009. The University of Idaho's instructional centers as well as agricultural research and extension centers give the University a statewide presence. * Demonstrated support from Aa2-rated state of Idaho, with state support constituting 41% of operating revenue in FY 2009. State support is strong on a per student basis at $13,064 in FY 2009 compared to the FY 2008 median for A1-rated institutions at $7,462. * Generally balanced operating performance, with cash flow margins of 8.5% in FY 2009 providing good average annual debt service coverage of 2.2 times (FY 2007-2009). We expect the University to continue to generate balanced to favorable operating performance despite pressured State funding due to the implementation of expense reductions and more conservative budgeting practices. CHALLENGES * Heavy reliance on state funding, leaving the University vulnerable to shortfalls in the event of state funding cuts. State operating appropriations represented nearly 41% of Moody's adjusted operating revenue in FY 2009. In FY 2010, the State has implemented a 6% holdback which the management expects to offset with expense reductions and increased revenue from student charges due to higher than budgeted enrollment. * Additional identified capital plans to be debt financed likely to further increase leverage over next two to three years. Management reports an additional $40 to $50 million in potential near-term borrowing plans. * Competitive market position and weak demographics in the State could challenge the University's efforts to stabilize enrollment, requiring close management. Management expects that the University will continue to be successful in recruiting students from out-of-state, particularly as neighboring states implement double digit tuition increases and limit enrollment at some institutions. MARKET/COMPETITIVE STRATEGY: MID-SIZED ENROLLMENT BASE AT LAND-GRANT AND FLAGSHIP PUBLIC UNIVERSITY ATTACHMENT 11a BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 239The University of Idaho's role as the land-grant and flagship public university for the State of Idaho (Aa2 Issuer Rating) provides the fundamental underpinning for its A1 long-term rating. The University offers a broad array of undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs, enrolling 10,350 full-time equivalent students in fall 2009. The University's main campus is in Moscow, a relatively rural area in the northwest portion of the State. This campus is supplemented by instructional centers in Boise, Coeur d'Alene, and Idaho Falls. In addition, other outreach activities, such as its seven agricultural research and extension centers, give the University a statewide presence. The University has the primary research mission among the State's public institutions, with moderate research expenditures of nearly $62.4 million in FY 2009. Research expenditures have declined somewhat in recent years as competition for grants from the federal government have increased dramatically. At this time, the University has received modest funding related to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Management reports an increased focus on the University's research profile with a 31% increase in grant proposals in FY 2010 over FY 2009. We do not expect the University to significantly increase its research profile in the near-term given the competitive funding environment and absence of a medical school. We expect the University of Idaho to maintain a mid-sized enrollment base despite weak local demographics and competition from public universities in neighboring states. The University has been successful in attracting out-of-state enrollment, with 40% of enrolled students from outside of Idaho. Out-of-state enrollment is primarily drawn from Washington, Montana, Oregon, California, and Alaska. Management expects continued success in its recruiting efforts as financial pressures in neighboring states have resulted in steep increases in tuition as well as enrollment caps. While the University of Idaho also plans tuition increases, management believes that the University retains significant pricing flexibility relative to peer institutions. In addition, we believe that the University's history of serving transfer students is a credit strength in a more challenging economic environment, as many students may shift to attending community college for the first two years of college in order to reduce the cost of education. In fall 2009, the University enrolled 736 new transfer students and 1,780 new first-time freshmen students. OPERATING PERFORMANCE: BALANCED OPERATING PERFORMANCE; HEAVILY RELIANT ON STATE SUPPORT ATTACHMENT 11a BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 240We believe the University of Idaho will continue to produce balanced operating performance in the near-term despite reductions in state support. Operating performance has been generally balanced with the University generating a -0.3% three-year average annual margin (FY 2007-2009), including the recognition of depreciation expense, a non-cash expense totaling nearly $20.6 million for FY 2009. Operating cash flow provided average debt service coverage of 2.2 times. Management has taken steps to mitigate the impact of reduced state support including reducing expenses, budgeting for a reserve to offset potential mid-year reductions, and increasing tuition and fees. The University remains highly reliant on State support, with State operating appropriations representing nearly 41% of Moody's adjusted revenue. Other revenue sources include student charges (tuition, fees, and auxiliary revenue) 23.6%, grants and contracts (excluding Pell Grants) 23.6%, gifts 4.8%, and other revenue 7%. State operating appropriations remain the largest source of operating revenue for the University, leaving it vulnerable to shortfalls in the event of reduced state funding. State support is strong on a per student basis at $13,064 in FY 2009 compared to the FY 2008 median for A1-rated institutions at $7,462. After several years of improved operating support, budgetary pressures at the State have resulted in holdbacks. In FY 2010, the State applied a total holdback of $7.1 million or 5.3% over FY 2009 and then implemented a mid-year holdback of an additional 1.0% or $1.4 million. To offset these reductions, the University received $5.3 million in stimulus funding in FY 2010 and expects to receive an additional $1.4 million in funding in FY 2011. Moody's maintains a Aa2 issuer rating for the State of Idaho, with a stable outlook. Idaho's issuer rating reflects a history of conservative fiscal management, low but rising debt levels, relatively diverse economy, and low wealth levels. It is important to note that Idaho is not immune to the current economic downturn and is experiencing revenue declines similar to other states. However , the State has been quick to react to sudden revenue drops by reducing expenditures of the state. For more information, please see Moody's report dated June 17, 2009. BALANCE SHEET POSITION: FINANCIAL RESOURCES PROVIDE ADEQUATE CUSHION FOR DEBT AND ANNUAL OPERATIONS Moody's believes that the University of Idaho's financial resources will continue to provide an adequate cushion for debt and operations given manageable near-term borrowing plans and improved philanthropic support. In FY 2009, the University and affiliated foundation's expendable ATTACHMENT 11a BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 241financial resources of $127.6 million provided 0.7 times coverage of pro- forma debt and 0.4 times coverage of annual operating expenses. Management reports the potential for $40 to 50 million of additional debt in the next two to three years to finance renovations to residential housing, research infrastructure, and academic facilities. However , management expects that the University's long-term debt outstanding will remain around $200 million, net of principal repayments. The University is in the silent phase of a capital campaign, with philanthropic support focused on balance sheet growth as well as capital projects. Fundraising has improved during the silent phase of the campaign, with gift revenue averaging $28.4 million during FY 2007- 2009. To date, the University has raised nearly $88 million in gifts and pledges towards a $300 million goal. The University's last campaign, which concluded in 2003, raised $129 million. We would expect that the current economic environment could challenge the University's fundraising efforts, as highlighted by the softening in gifts in 2009 relative to prior three years. During fiscal 2009, the Foundation's investments declined by 15.4%. Investment returns have been favorable in fiscal 2010, with a positive 16.81% return through December 31, 2009. The Foundation's allocation includes 36.2% in publicly traded domestic equities, 13.4% in publicly traded international equities, 47.8% in fixed income, 1.7% in private equity, and 0.9% cash equivalents. The Foundation has highly manageable private equity call commitments of approximately $3.3 million as of November 30, 2009. As of June 30, 2009, the University had monthly unrestricted liquidity of $20.7 million, providing nearly 22 days of cash on hand. Outlook The stable rating outlook reflects the University's fundamental market strength as the land-grant and flagship university in Idaho. The outlook incorporates our expectation of continued solid, though weakened, state operating support and balanced to positive operating performance with manageable near-term borrowing plans.

Additionally, Standard & Poor's affirmed its 'A+' long term and underlying rating (SPUR) on UI's outstanding debt. The outlook is stable. The rating reflects our view of UI's: Role as flagship institution in the state's higher education system, with 37% of fiscal 2009 revenues coming from state appropriations; Stabilized demand and enrollment; and Modest levels of financial resources, with unrestricted net assets (UNA) in fiscal 2009 representing 13% of operating expenses and 23.8% of total debt. The rating is offset by our view of Ul's: Mixed operational performance; Low levels of UNA at the foundation, with a modest fund raising histoty; and Ongoing budgetary pressures associated with a challenging economy and state funding environment as well as efforts to combine or consolidate program offerings. With the series 2010A, 2010B, 2010C, and 2011 bonds, the university will have total pro forma debt of $172.14 million. Ul's estimated $13 million in maximum annual debt service (MADS) results in a still moderate debt burden of 3.8% of operating expenses. The bonds will be used to: Series 2010A: To refund the series 1996 and 1997B bonds; Series 2010B: To refund a $10 million loan from Wells Fargo; Series 2010C: Will provide $13 million of new money toward the renovation of the Kibbie Dome and are expected to be issued as taxable Build America Bonds (BABs); and Standard & Poor's I RatingsDirect on the Global Credit Portal I February 9.2010 2 7746351301277089 ATTACHMENT 11b BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 252University Of Idaho Regents, University Of Idaho; Public ColllUniv -Unlimited Student Fees Series 2011: Expected to be issued in January 2011 to refund the series 2007A bonds, subject to a forward-delivery bond purchase contract with George K. Baum & Company. All four series of bonds are secured by pledged revenues of the university, which Standard & Poor's considers to be equivalent to an unlimited student fee pledge. The tax subsidy received through the BABs program are expected to be used toward payment of debt service although pledged revenues are sufficient to cover debt service should the subsidy fail. As per the forward delivery bond purchase contract, the university is obligated to issue the series 2011 bonds in the structure and form outlined in the preliminary official statement, and George K Baum & Company is obligated to purchase them, unless an adverse change to state or federal law which prohibits it from doing so. Post issuance, the university is expected to have approximately $172.14 million of outstanding debt, all fixed rate (the series 2007 A bonds adjustable rate after April 1, 2011, and series 2007B bonds adjustable rate after April 1, 2018) and all issued under the same security pledge. Outlook The stable outlook reflects our anticipation that UI's enrollment will continue to be stable or show modest growth. Additionally, it reflects our expectation of continued state financial support, and VI's continued efforts to achieve balanced financial operations on at least a cash basis, returning to balanced operations on a full accrual basis over time. We anticipate that the system's future debt will be matched with additional financial resources. Improved fund raising would be viewed positively. The University The university was established in 1889, in Moscow, Idaho, as a territorial university and is the state IS oldest institution of higher learning. UI is charged with the primary responsibility in the state for advanced research and graduate education. The Idaho University Regents are responsible for policy direction, and its members also serve as the Idaho State Board of Education. The university is managed by President Duane Nellis, who was hired in July 2009. The university is comprised of 10 colleges: Agricultural and life science; Art and architecture; Letters, arts~ and social sciences; and Natural resources and science. In addition to degree programs, the university offers medical training for students in association with the University of Washington. Also, VI has several cooperative programs with Washington State University. www.standardandpoors.comfratingsdirect 3 77461) i 301277088 ATTACHMENT 11b BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 253University Of Idaho Regents, University Of Idaho; Public ColllUniv -Unlimited Student Fees Demand Enrollment has been steady, with 11,957 headcount for fall 2009. Approximately 87% of students are undergrads, with the majority taking classes full time. The university accepts nearly 80% of its applicants (fall 2009), but the matriculation rate is a strong 44%, indicating a fair amount of self-selection among the applicants. Student quality is slightly above average, with an average SAT score of 1098 and average ACT score of 23. Approximately 61 % of the students are from Idaho; another 28 % are from Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. Finances State operating appropriations had increased from $90.7 million in general account appropriations in fiscal 2006 to $104.9 million in fiscal 2009. However, the state implemented a series of holdbacks and reductions in fiscal 2009 (approximately $5 million), which brought 2009 receipts to $99.5 million. An additional $5.1 million in holdbacks and reductions are expected for fiscal 2010, with general account appropriation receipts for the year estimated at $94.3 million. State appropriations, which represent about 37% of fiscal 2009 operating revenues, are the university IS largest revenue source. Management reports that the university was able to manage through a mid-year reversion of state appropriations in fiscal 2009 by implementing a hiring freeze and various expense-reduction measures. Similar cost-reduction measures are being implemented in fiscal 2010 in response to the holdback. State payments have been received on a timely basis and no additional holdbacks are expected for the current fiscal year. Student fees and associated auxiliaries make up another 27.7% of university revenues, and research grants account for another 21.5%. In the 2009-2010 school year, student fees were raised 6.5% to a still affordable $4,932 per year for resident undergraduates. The university posted a $13 million decrease in net assets for fiscal 2009, due primarily to $14.6 million in unrealized losses to the value of its investments in the fiscal year. Excluding those losses and capital revenues (which are often one-time in nature), the university had a $2.3 million deficit for the year. The university has a history of balanced operations on a full accrual basis and with depreciation of $20.6 million, is still balanced on a cash basis. Ul's net assets for fiscal 2009 were $372.8 million. Of this amount, $36.2 million was unrestricted, a 5% decrease from the fiscal 2008. Unrestricted net assets (including those of the foundation), accounted for 11.0% of operations and 23.8% of pro forma debt, which is still adequate for the rating category. The university's retirement plan is run through the state-created Public Employee Retirement System of Idaho (PERSI). Post-retirement benefits are provided through a defined benefit plan administered by the university. Debt With the series 2010A, 2010B, 2010C, and 2011 bonds, the university will have total pro forma debt of $172.14 million. Estimated MADS of $13 million results in what we consider a still moderatedebt burden of 3.8% of operating expenses. The series 2010A bonds will be used to refund the series 1996 and 1997B bonds; the series 2010B bonds will be used to refund a $10 million loan from Wells Fargo, the series 2010C bonds will be used toward the renovation of the Kibbie Dome and are expected to be issued as taxable BABs; and the series 2011 bonds are expected to be issued to current refund the series 2007 A bonds subject to a forward purchase agreement. All four series of bonds are secured by pledged revenues of the university, which Standard & Poor's considers to be Standard & Poor's I RatingsDirect on the Global Credit Portal I February 9, 201 0 4 ATTACHMENT 11b BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 254University Of Idaho Regents, University Of Idaho; Public ColllUniv -Unlimited Student Pees equivalent to an unlimited student fee pledge. The university has been combining its debt into a single revenue bond security pledge from the student fees and revenues it has previously pledged as security on a stand-alone basis for individual prior issues of its bonds. Covenants were adjusted, with required pledged revenues of 1.00x instead of 1.25x, and a debt service reserve fund was eliminated. We consider this pledge to be equivalent to a general obligation of the university due to its breadth. Pledged revenues include a variety of student fees, sales and service revenue, facilities and administration recovery, and other revenues. Pledged revenues were $115.3 million in fiscal 2009 and $115.9 million in fiscal 2008. The activity center fee system series 1996 ($3.1 million outstanding) has a senior lien on the new pledged revenues. This lien is closed. The series 1996 bonds are expected to be completed refunded by the series 2010A bonds. Investments, Endowments, And Fundraising The foundation and its relationship to the university were restructured a couple of years ago, following an incident involving loan write-offs. Revisions include a rewritten policy on gifts and affiliated programs and recently approved updates to the operating agreement. As of December 2009, the university's endowment had an estimated market value of $169 million. Overall university investments were $213 million at June 30, 2009. Of this, the foundation holds $156.7 million. Approximately 50% of the university'S investments are in equities with another 45% in fixed income, 3% in REITs, and 1.7% in private equity. The university!s last capital campaign concluded in 2002, raising $125 million against a $100 million goal. Government Related Entities (GRE) In accordance with our criteria for government-related entities (GREs), we based our view of a \"low\" likelihood of extraordinary government support on our assessment of Urs \"weak\" link with Idaho (AAlStable) given the state's limited involvement with the day-ta-day operations of the university, history of annual operating appropriations, and no history of extraordinary support. We also based our assessment on urs !1limited\" role in the statets economy compared with that of other state GREs, despite UI's position as a flagship institution of higher education and its general contributions to economic development.

GEORGE K. BAUM & COMPANY By: _________________________________________ Its: Executive Vice President THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO By: __________________________________________ Lloyd Mues, Vice President for Finance and Administration and Bursar BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 6 Page 1 UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO SUBJECT Temporary easement to permit the City of Moscow to construct and maintain a public bus stop shelter on property owned by the Regents APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Govern ing Policies & Procedures, Section V.I.5.b(2) BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION The City of Moscow is seeking federal funding to construct public bus stop shelters at selected sites along existing public bus routes. One proposed site is partially located on Regents' property cu rrently used as a sidewalk/landscaped area located between University of I daho's Living Learning Communities and a publicly owned street and side walk right of way. The funding agency requires a commitment from the City of Moscow to ma intain the shelter for twenty years and therefore the City must possess a substantial real estate interest in the property to secure the continued use of a public bus shelter. Providing a convenient location for a bus stop shelter serving University students and staff will accommodate the regular us e of public transportation to and from campus. The proposed easement defines the extent and limit of rights established and provides for early termina tion in the event the shelter is not constructed or no longer utiliz ed as part of a public tran sportation network. This easement will occupy 148 sq ft and wil l terminate in twenty years. IMPACT The University will not pay any constr uction or maintenance costs associated with the proposed use. The Un iversity will not charge for the small, temporary easement; however students and staff will benefit from the facility. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Proposed Easement Page 3 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The City of Moscow has received federal st imulus money for this purpose, but to make this campus site eligible for us e of the funding the City must have an easement prior to construc tion of the bus stop shelte r. The easement is not needed to make the applicati on for funding, rather the easement is necessary to spend the funding at this site. The City and entire UI community would benefit from this new public transit amenity. If this easement is not granted, the City will select another bus stop off-campus. Staff recommends approval.

APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Govern ing Policies & Procedures, Section V.C.2.a. and V.I.3. BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION In 1989, the University converted from internal operations for its food services (residential board and dining hall, cafeteri a, catering, etc) to a food service contract. Since 1989 t he contract has been with Sode xho America, LLC, or its predecessor entities, originally Marrio tt Management Services Corporation. Under the contract terms, all responsib ility for food service was outsourced and the University received a small annual f ee. All underlying operations and costs were controlled by the contract vendor. In 2006 the University commissioned a consul tant to examine the contract. The consultant recommended restructuring of the contract relationship. The University examined vari ous alternatives for food service and determined to continue with an outsource contract rela tionship, but to seek significantly changed compensation terms. In 2009 a request for proposals was issued utilizing a best-value procurement methodology developed by Ar izona State University. This method allows the University to describe its goals for the contract in the request for proposals and then to engage in qua litative analysis of the proposals based on each vendor's proposed means of accomplishing the Univer sity's goals as well as relative qualifications between the vendors and the like lihood accomplishing the University's goals. The Univ ersity's goals of this RFP were to increase financial return to the University, increase the en vironmental sustaina bility of dining services, and increase both Universi ty and student satisfaction. The University received competitive pr oposals from three national food service organizations with significant experience in food service at a residential university setting. The University's evaluation team conducted a th orough evaluation of the three responses including evaluation and clarification of t he proposed financial structure of each proposal and interviews of proposed service personnel. The BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 2 evaluation team est ablished Sodexho as the best-va lue vendor for the University of Idaho dining services. The terms proposed by Sodexho are summarized as follows: 1. Contract term runs for 5 years with the right in the University for early termination. 2. The Contractor will oper ate the University's residential food service, retail food sale establishments and catering functions. 3. The Contractor will be paid an est ablished fixed annual fee plus an additional variable fee based on gro ss operating revenues. The balance of food service revenues are retained by the University. 4. The Contractor will be responsible fo r all costs of operations - as part of the fixed and variable fee. 5. The payment schedule for the fee is based on food service revenues as they are received. 6. The Contractor has committed to an in vestment of $2,665,000 in capital and equipment improvements over the life of the contract. IMPACT Under the prior outsource c ontract, the University received less than $50,000 per year from the food service operations on campus. The proposed contract calls for a significant increase in income to t he university. Attachment 1 outlines both the total fee for the contractor as well as the fee pay ment schedule and a projection of income for the University at an estimated gross sales level. If the University and the Contractor achieve the estimated sales, the University stands to realize income in excess of $10 million ov er the 5 year term of the contract. The combination fixed and variable fee illu strated in Attachment 1 minimizes risk of loss to the University since the University would have to operate well below historic income figures to have revenues less than the amount necessary to fund the fixed fee. The contract payment mechanism also provides financial motivation to the Contractor to both ma ximize student satisfaction in order to enhance gross sales, as well as minimizi ng costs, since Contractor costs are paid from the fixed and variable fee. The contract is projected to produce income to the Univ ersity over the five year term in the amount of $10,346,000 based upon current volume projections. Fixed fees paid to Sodexho over the sa me five year term will total $35,344,041 with an additional volume based variable fee not to exceed $35,344,041 (based on sales volume in excess of that necessary to fund the fixed fee). Additionally, contractor will provi de $2,665,000 in capi tal and equipment improvements over the 5 year term of the contract.

Page 7 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS In 2009, the UI issued a RFP for campus -wide food service operations. Three competitive proposals were received, and the UI selected Sodexho America (its current dining services contractor) as the best vendor. The UI negotiated an outsource contract with performance incent ives and financial terms significantly more favorable to the University than the prior contract. Based on conservative estimates of sales revenue, the University stands to realize income in excess of $10 million over the 5 year term of t he contract. Staff recommends approval.

For the Regents of the Sodexo America, LLC UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO SIGN ____________________ SIGN ____________________ ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 15 PRINT Christopher Johnson PRINT Kirt Ingram TITLE Director, Contracts TITLE Senior Vice President __ DATE __________________ DATE ___________ UI 670 Attachment A University of Idaho Request for Proposals Number 09-58J Dining Services 06/10/09 SECTION 1 - SCOPE OF WORK 1.1 BACKGROUND The University of Idaho (herein referred to as the University) is soliciting proposals for the management and operation of dining services at the University of Idaho Moscow campus. The University shall only consider proposals from financially responsible firms presently engaged in the business of providing dining services. Each Vendor (proposer/firm) shall furnish the required documents in the required format as outlined in this RFP to be considered responsive. The University expects to award this project to the best valued Vendor based on the requirements in this solicitation. The Vendor selected for award will be the Vendor whose proposal is responsive, responsible, and is the most advantageous to the University, as determined by the University in its sole discretion. 1.2 CURRENT CONDITIONS Best efforts have been made to obtain detailed information on the current conditions at the University. This information should not be assumed to be 100% complete or accurate. Information of all known current conditions can be found in Exhibit 1. The University is looking to secure services equal to, or better than, the level of service currently provided. 1.3 SCOPE OF SERVICES It is the University's desire to move away from the current fixed fee arrangement, in place under the existing contract, and to move toward a commission based structure. Due to the financing of University facilities (through tax exempt bonds), there are restrictions on commission based financial structures. The University has found two available Safe Harbor approaches for structuring the contract that will allow for the payment of commissions as a percentage of ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 16 revenue. These options include a TwoYear Safe Harbor Proposal and a FiveYear Safe Harbor Proposal. The University is requesting proposals for both options in this RFP. The University's goals of this RFP are to: 1. Increase Financial Return to the University 2. Increase Environmental Sustainability of Dining Services 3. Increase Satisfaction (University and Student) The scope of work and expectations for th e dining service provi der are identified in Exhibit 2. SECTION 2 - SCHEDULE AND CRITICAL DATES 2.1 SCHEDULE OF EVENTS AND CRITICAL DATES The following are the critical dates for this project.

The University reserves the right to request supplementary information to assure the University that the Vendor's competence, business organization, and financial resources are adequate to successfully perform the specified service. Proposals will be evaluated on the criteria listed in the table below. 35 Points Interview Refer to Section 3.9 25 Points RAVA Plan Refer to Section 3.7 20 Points Financial Proposal Refer to Section 3.4 10 Points Work Plan Refer to Section 3.6 10 Points Past Performance Information Refer to Section 3.8 3.3 EVALUATION COMMITTEE ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 18 An Evaluation Committee will be used to evaluate specific portions of the proposals (as described in this RFP). The University expects the committee to consist of 37 individuals. 3.4 PROPOSAL FORM (Attachment B) The Vendor will prepare and submit a Proposal Form (Attachment B). The Proposal Form requires the following information: 1. Identify the critical individuals that the Vendor will use for the duration of this project 2. Identify the financial information for a 2Year 100% Commission structure 3. Identify the financial information for a 5Year 50% Commission and Annual Fee structure 3.5 TWO YEAR FINANCIAL PRO FORMA (Attachment C) Utilizing the worksheet provided in Attachment C, provide a summary of financial Pro Forma projections of revenue and expense for the first two years of the contract term, assuming the current meal plan structure, with meal plan pricing escalated annually for inflation. When developing your projections, you must follow these guidelines: You must submit your projections using the electronic workbook provided. Provide both electronic and paper copies of projections. Direct Costs must be separately identified from Indirect Costs, and each type of Indirect Cost must be listed as a separate line item. As per the template, provide a detailed schedule of any onetime transition or start up costs identified for Year 1. Identify the basis for your projections as identified and required on the spreadsheet, and note any other factors that influence your projection. Insure that all formulas are correct. 3.6 WORK PLAN (Attachment D) The purpose of the Work Plan is to identify the vendor's ability to generate a concise synopsis of the work that will be performed to complete the project or service. The Work Plan should be a succinct summary of the project. The Work Plan should be used to prove to the client that the vendor can visualize what they are going to do before they do it. The Work Plan should be developed around fulfilling the client's scope requirements within the known project constraints of cost, time, and expected quality. The Work Plan should: Show the vendor's impression of the project in terms of scope alignment within the clients expected cost and schedule requirements Describe how the service requirements will be fulfilled (in terms of major tasks, steps, or work packages). Describe the Vendor's plan for customer service (both to the Universities and to Students) Describe how the Vendor will promote the value of this program to encourage higher enrollment Convey the points of differential from the current service/structure in terms of financial or other dominant metrics, and explain how the change(s) will be made and sustained. In order to minimize any bias, the Work Plan must NOT contain any names that can be used to identify who the vendor is (such as company names, personnel names, project names, or product names). A Work Plan template is provided in this document and must be used by all ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 19 vendors. Vendors are NOT allowed to recreate, reformat, or modify the template (cannot alter font size, font type, font color, add colors, pictures, diagrams, etc). An electronic copy of this document is available for download and must be used. The Work Plan must NOT exceed 2 pages (front side of page only). Any plan that contains names, or fails to meet all of the formatting requirements mentioned above, shall be marked as unresponsive and eliminated from the evaluation process. An evaluation committee will review and rate each Work Plan. All Work Plans will be rated comparatively to one another. They will be rated on a scale of 110. It is the vendor's responsibility to prove to the client that they have more expertise from their competitors. 3.7 RISK ASSESSMENT AND VALUE ADDED PLAN (Attachment E) Objective of the RAVA Plan The University has made the assumption that each Proposer can deliver a quality dining program that will fulfill the minimal needs of the University. Instead of focusing on this minimum expectation, the University is allowing Proposers to compete based on value and their ability to maximize the University's satisfaction. The Risk Assessment and Value Added (RAVA) Plan is used to identify the Vendor's ability to generate a concise synopsis of their plan of work that will be used to complete the project or service. The RAVA Plan has two major components, including a Risk Assessment Plan, and a Value Added Plan. The RAVA Plan serves several purposes, including: 1. Assist the client in prioritizing vendors based on their ability to understand the project. 2. Assist the vendor in visualizing what they are going to do before they do it. 3. Minimize the effort of experienced companies who are competing for the project / service. 4. Provide high performing vendors the opportunity to differentiate themselves from their competitors due to their experience and expertise. The RAVA Plans should not contain any marketing information. The Plan should be used to prove to the client that the vendor has expertise on the specific project / service being proposed on. The RAVA Plan will become part of the final contract (if the vendor is selected for award). RAVA Plan Format In order to minimize any bias, the RAVA Plan must NOT contain any names that can be used to identify who the vendor is (such as company names, personnel names, project names, or product names). A RAVA Plan template is provided in this document and must be used by all vendors. Vendors are NOT allowed to recreate, reformat, or modify the template (cannot alter font size, font type, font color, add colors, pictures, diagrams, etc). An electronic copy of this document is available for download and must be used. ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 20 The University's goal is to make the selection process as efficient as possible. Efficiency is to minimize the effort of all participants. Therefore, the RAVA Plan should be a brief and concise overview of the project. The RAVA Plan must NOT exceed 2 pages (front side of page only). Any plan that contains names, or fails to meet all of the formatting requirements mentioned above, shall be marked as unresponsive and eliminated from the evaluation process. Evaluation of RAVA Plan An evaluation committee will review and rate each RAVA Plan. Since there are no names in the RAVA Plans, the evaluation will minimize any personal bias that an evaluator may have towards any vendor (positive or negative bias). All RAVA Plan's will be rated comparatively to one another. They will be rated on a scale of 110. Vendors should keep in mind that the RAVA Plan is only one step in the selection process. If all the RAVA Plans are the same, they will receive the same score, and the RAVA Plan will have little impact in the selection. Therefore it is the vendor's responsibility to prove to the client that they have more expertise from their competitors. Overview of the Risk Assessment Section The Risk Assessment section should address any risks that the Proposer sees impacting a successful delivery of dining services, considering all expectations as described in this RFP. It is the assumption of the University that all Proposers have the capability to effectively deliver dining services and meet all the expectations. The University wishes to examine the relative ability of each firm to understand and convey the key risks to this service and how each risk will be minimized. The Vendor should list and prioritize major risk items that are unique to this project. This includes areas that may cause the project to not be completed on time, not finished within budget, generate any change orders, or may be a source of dissatisfaction for the owner. Risks can include things that you control and things that you do not control. The risk should be nontechnical, but should also contain enough information to describe to a reader why the risk is a valid risk. The Vendor must also explain how they will avoid or minimize the risk from occurring. If the Vendor has a unique method to minimize the risk, they should explain it in nontechnical terms. Note: the potential bestvalued Vendor will be required to minimize the risks identified by all Vendors as outlined in Exhibit 4. The Risk Assessment plan gives the opportunity for the Proposers to differentiate their capabilities based on their ability to understand, see, and minimize risk to the University and the risk to a successful outcome of the dining services. Overview of the Value Added Section The purpose of the Value Added Plan is to provide vendors with an opportunity to identify any value added options or ideas that may benefit the client or service. These options or ideas may also be referred to as additional or optional services. If the vendor can include more scope or service within the constraints of the Universities, they should provide an outline of potential value added options. If the student premiums are a risk, the vendor should provide value added ideas to alter the scope of work to meet the clients constraints. All value added options must be related to a cost impact. Remember: All value added ideas must NOT be included in the base proposal fee or premium rates. Prior to award, the UNIVERSITY will determine if the value added items will be accepted or rejected. ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 21 3.8 PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (Exhibit 3) The University will be analyzing past performance information on the Vendor and critical individuals of their team. The Vendor is encouraged to only submit highly satisfied references. Please review Exhibit 3 for detailed instructions on collecting and submitting PPI for this proposal. 3.9 INTERVIEW The University shall shortlist Vendors (if necessary) based on all of the submitted information (Financials, RAVA Plan Rating, Work Plan Rating, and PPI). The highest ranking Vendors will be invited to participate in the interview process. The University will interview all of the critical team components from each of the shortlisted firms, including (but not limited to): 1. Regional Vice President 2. OnSite General Manager 3. Director of Catering 4. Executive Chef The University may also request to interview additional personnel. The University will interview individuals separately (but also reserves the right to interview as a group). The University may request additional information prior to interviews (such as a list of similar past projects, a detailed cost breakdown, a detailed project schedule, etc). No other individuals (from the Vendors organization) will be allowed to sit in or participate during the interviews. Important Note: All proposed team members must be available in person for interviews on the date specified in this solicitation. No substitutes, proxies, phone interviews, or electronic interviews will be allowed. Individuals who fail to attend the interview will not be given a score which may jeopardize the firm's competitiveness. If awarded the project, all interview statements will become part of the final contract. SECTION 4 - SELECTION PROCESS 4.1 ANALYSIS OF PROPOSALS All responsive proposals will be evaluated based on the criteria and weights outlined in Section 3. The University shall use a decision making tool(s) to assist in analyzing and prioritizing the proposals based on the submitted information. The University will determine the potential bestvalued vendor who, in the sole judgment of the University, best meets the RFP requirements. The University reserves the right to clarify or seek additional information on any proposal. The University also reserves the right to rescope the project, and/or cancel and reject all proposals. 4.2 PRE AWARD PHASE ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 22 The University will identify the potential bestvalued Vendor (as outlined in Section 4.1). The potential bestvalued Vendor will be required to perform the PreAward functions as outlined in Exhibit 4. The intent of this period is to allow the Vendor an opportunity to clarify any issues or risks, and to prepare a Pre Award Document. The Pre Award Period is not a negotiation period. The Vendor will not be permitted to modify their cost/fee/financial rates, project durations, or project team. The potential bestvalued Vendor will be required to conduct a PreAward Meeting. If the University is not satisfied upon completion of the PreAward Meeting, the University may consider another Vendor for potential award (this Vendor would also have to conduct a PreAward Meeting). If the University is satisfied with the potential bestvalue, they will proceed to issue an Award and Notice to Proceed. SECTION 5 - POST AWARD PROCEDURES 5.1 WEEKLY RISK REPORTING SYSTEM The awarded Vendor will be required to submit weekly reports documenting risks on the project, as outlined in Exhibit 5. The reports are due every Friday, once a notice to proceed is issued, until the project/service is 100% completed. It is the vendor's responsibility to submit accurate reports on time. The accuracy and ontime submittal of the reports will impact the vendor's final rating. 5.2 PERFORMANCE REPORTS The Vendor will be required to document the performance of their services on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis. The monthly reports shall provide dominant information on the status of the project, including (but not limited to): 1. Number of mandatory boarder counts 2. Number of voluntary boarder counts 3. Total amount of capital invested 4. Total amount of commissions paid to client 5. Total amount of revenue generated from retail services 6. Total amount of revenue generated from catering services 7. Total amount of revenue generated from mandatory meal plans 8. Total amount of revenue generated from voluntary meal plans 9. Total amount of revenue paid to the client Along with the monthly reports, the vendor will also be required to collect and compile student satisfaction surveys once per semester. The details of the required documented reports shall be finalized during the Pre Award Period (Section 4.2). 5.3 MANDATORY EDUCATIONAL FEE The University shall require the Vendor to partner with the Performance Based Studies Research Group, at Arizona State University, to receive education and training on performance reporting guidelines. The fee for this education is $35,000 per year. The University will require this ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 23 education for a minimum of 2 years. Payments for the above costs will be made to the University specifically for PBSRG education. 5.4 POST PROJECT EVALUATION Upon completion of the project, the Vendor will be evaluated based on their performance on the project. This includes (but is not limited to): overall quality, ability to manage the service, ability to minimize complaints, ability to minimize University efforts, ability to service the students, submission of accurate weekly reports, and submission of accurate monthly and yearly reports. The final rating will be used to modify the Project Teams PPI scores by 50% (including the prime Vendor, and critical individuals). The modified rating will be used for competition on future projects at the University.

Possession, Consumption, and Sale of Alcohol Beverages at Institutional Facilities a. Board Administrative Rules IDAPA 08.01.08 provides requirements relative to alcoholic beverages on campus grounds. Said rules generally prohibit the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages in areas open to and most commonly used by the general public on campus grounds. The rules authorize the Board to waive the prohibition pursuant to Board policies and procedures. The chief executive officer of each institution may waive the prohibition against possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages only as permitted by and in compliance with this policy. The grant of any such waiver shall be determined by the chief executive officer (\"CEO\") only in compliance with this Policy and in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, and not as a matter of right to any other person or party, in doing so, the chief executive officer must ensure that the decisions to allow possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages are consistent with the proper image and the mission of the institution. b. Each institution shall maintain a policy providing for an institutional Alcohol Beverage Permit process. For purposes of this policy, the term \"alcoholic beverage\" shall include any beverage containing alcoholic liquor as defined in Idaho Code Section 23105. Waiver of the prohibition against possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages shall be evidenced by issuance of a written Alcohol Beverage Permit issued by the CEO of the institution which may be issued only in response to a completed written application therefore.

Food must be available at the Permitted Event. Consumption of alcoholic beverages and food cannot be the sole purpose of a Permitted Event. (3) Nonalcoholic beverages must be as readily available as alcoholic beverages at the Permitted Event. (4) A Permitted Event must be one requiring paid admission through purchase of a ticket or through payment of a registration fee, or one where admission is by written, personal invitation.

(5) Permitted Events which are generally open to the public through purchase of a ticket (such as sporting events, concerts or other entertainment events) must set out a confined and defined area where alcoholic beverages may be possessed and consumed. For such events, the defined area where alcoholic beverages may be possessed and consumed shall be clearly marked as such, and shall be separated in a fashion that entry into the area and exit from the area can be controlled to ensure that only those authorized to enter the area do so and that no alcoholic beverages leave the area. Only those individuals lawfully attending the Permitted Event who are of lawful age to consume alcoholic beverages may be allowed into the defined area, provided that such individuals may be accompanied by youth for whom they are responsible, but only if such youth are, at all times, under the supervision and control of such individuals. For such events there shall be sufficient space outside of the area where alcoholic beverages may be possessed and consumed to accommodate the participating public who do not wish to be present where alcoholic beverages are being consumed. (6) No student athletic events, (including without limitation NCAA, NIT, NAIA and intramural student athletic events) occurring in college or university owned, leased or operated facilities, or anywhere on campus grounds, shall be Permitted Events, nor ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 53 shall a Permitted Event be allowed in conjunction with any such student athletic event.

Any alcoholic beverages allowed at a Permitted Event shall be supplied through authorized contractors of the organizers (such as caterers hired by the organizers). In no event shall the institution supply or sell alcoholic beverages directly. In no event shall the general public, or any participants in a Permitted Event be allowed to bring alcoholic beverages into a Permitted Event, or leave the defined area where possession and consumption is allowed while in possession of an alcoholic beverage. (11)The person/group issued the Beverage Permit and the contractors supplying the alcoholic beverages shall assume full responsibility to ensure that no one under the legal drinking age is supplied with any alcoholic beverage or allowed to consume any alcoholic beverage at the Permitted Event. Further, the person/group must provide proof of insurance coverage, including host liquor liability and liquor legal liability, in amounts and coverage limits sufficient to meet the needs of the institution, but in no case less than $500,000 minimum coverage per occurrence.

After a \"Reference List\" is completed, the Vendor will be required to: a Prepare a survey questionnaire for each of their past clients (on the reference list) b Send the survey questionnaires to their past clients c Receive the survey questionnaires from their past clients d Submit the completed survey questionnaires to the University of Idaho The following steps will assist you in completing the aforementioned tasks. 2. Each key component is responsible for sending out a survey questionnaire to each of their past clients. The survey questionnaire is provided in this document and can also be downloaded. ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 64 3. Each key component should enter the required information on the survey questionnaire: a Survey ID (Code) b Past clients contact information c Project information d Name of the firm and/or individual being surveyed The information must match the data submitted in the \"Reference List\" (see Figure 4). 4. The Vendor should also modify the return information at the bottom of the survey with a contact person and an accurate fax number. Remember, the survey will be sent from your past client to your firm (so you must enter a valid fax number). 5. All returned surveys MUST be evaluated and signed by the past client. If a survey is not signed, it will NOT be counted. ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 65 6. Each key component is responsible for making sure that their past clients receive the survey, complete the survey, and return the survey back to the Vendor. 7. The client/owner must evaluate and complete the survey (you cannot have other consultants or third parties evaluate your performance). 8. The client/owner must sign the survey form to prove that they completed the survey. 9. All of the returned surveys should be packaged together and submitted with your proposal. The scores of the submitted surveys will be used to compile the average Past Performance Information rating for the critical key component. 10. The University may contact the reference to clarify a survey rating, check for accuracy, or to obtain additional information. If the reference cannot be contacted, the survey will be deleted and no credit given for that reference.

The client's objective is to have the project/service completed on time, without any cost increases, and with high customer satisfaction. At the end of the project, the client will evaluate the performance of the Vendor based on these factors, so it is very important that the Vendor preplans the project to ensure there are no surprises. It is the Vendor's responsibility to ensure it understands the client's subjective expectations. It is not the client's responsibility to ensure that the Vendor understands what their expectations are. The Vendor is at risk, and part of the risk is understanding the client's expectations. The Pre Award Phase provides the Vendor with a final opportunity to protect itself, by allowing the Vendor to carefully preplan the project before an award is made. The preplanning should include all coordination and identification of all risks that cannot be controlled by the Vendor. In many cases, one of the Vendor's biggest risks (in terms of delivering the service with high satisfaction) is the client themselves. Therefore, it is in the Vendor's best interest to identify any issues or concerns ahead of time during the preaward phase. The Vendor should minimize their risk by creating documentation that puts them in control and eliminates any outside interference that could hinder them from performing. PRE PLANNING AND COORDINATION Once you are notified that you are the potential bestvalued Vendor, you will receive a list of all risks identified by the other Vendors that proposed. You may also receive an additional list of any client issues or concerns. The University requires that the Vendor attend a Kick Off Meeting to discuss the objectives of the Pre Award Phase. A short video tutorial is also available online (www.pbsrg.com) , which provides information on the Pre Award Phase. The Vendor is required to watch the video and perform the following functions: Revisit the site to do any additional investigating. Coordinate with all parties that will be involved with the project. Identify what concerns they have and determine solutions to resolve their concerns. This may include consultants, subvendors, and suppliers (to ensure that there are no inconsistencies with the requirements or delivery schedules.) Identify where the risk lies on the project and make sure that all identified risks can be minimized. Identify any actions required by the client or client's representatives. Identify all risks that you (the vendor) do not control with a plan to mitigate the risks ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 68 PRE AWARD DOCUMENT The objective of the Vendor's Pre Award Document is to identify risk that the Vendor does not control or risk that is impacted by factors that the Vendor does not control. The Vendor must also identify how they will attempt to minimize the risk. If the Vendor does not identify the risk that they do not control, then the Vendor is stating the risk (stated or not stated) is under their control and a part of their contract to meet the intent of the client. Risks from all the other Vendors are provided to the best value Vendor to ensure that they are identifying all the risks that they do not control. This forces the Vendor to do what a best value Vendor would do, to think in the best interest of the client. The Pre Award Document should address the concerns of the client. The identification of these concerns is a clarification of the understanding of the client's intent in the best value process. It in no way changes the technical scope or amount of work of the Vendor, but merely confirms that the Vendor has understood the intent of the client. The objective of these clarifications are to confirm that the Vendor who is being hired understands the client's intent. The Pre Award Document must include the following items as a minimum: 1. A project financial summary 2. A summary of accepted/rejected value added options 3. A complete project schedule including a transition milestones schedule. 4. A list of all risks identified by other vendors along with solutions to the risks. 5. A complete list of factors/risks which are outside the control of the Vendor. 6. A project action item checklist 7. A project and emergency contact list. 8. A detailed list of monthly, quarterly, and yearly performance metrics and benchmarks that must consider financial performance, quality and customer satisfaction performance, and other necessary benchmarks of the received level of service. 9. A detailed summary of proposal assumptions. PRE AWARD MEETING The pre award meeting is held at the end of the pre award phase and is used to present a summary of what was developed and agreed upon during the pre award phase. The preaward meeting is not a question and answer session. The Vendor must not wait for the meeting to ask questions. All coordination and planning with the client should be done prior to the meeting. The Vendor should give a presentation, which walks the client through the entire project and summarizes all of the coordination/planning done during the preaward period. The Vendor should bring their team and all the documents specified in the Pre Award Document. The Vendor should come with documents explaining what the client is responsible for in this project and should identify exactly what they want from the client with due dates. The Vendor must convince the client that they have minimized all risks and will not be surprised once the project begins. The preaward meeting presentation (and ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 69 meeting minutes, if applicable) will become part of the contract along with the other documents stated in the PreAward Document. If, upon presentation of the PreAward Document, the University deems it to be demonstrably nonresponsive to any of the University's stated expectations, the University may elect to immediately cease clarifications with the top ranked Proposer and invite the next highest ranked Proposer into this period. REMEMBER: The Pre Award Phase provides the Vendor with a final opportunity to protect itself, by allowing the Vendor to carefully preplan the project before an award is made. If the Vendor does not identify a risk or risks that they do not control, then the Vendor is stating the risk (stated or not stated) is under their control and a part of their contract to meet the intent of the client. ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 70 EXHIBIT 5 WEEKLY RISK REPORTING SYSTEM GUIDE OVERVIEW The Weekly Risk Reporting System (WRRS) is a tool for the University in analyzing the performance of the service based on risk. The WRRS is expected to take minimal effort (approximately 5 minutes per week). The WRRS does not substitute or eliminate weekly progress reports or any other traditional reporting systems or meetings (that the Vendor may do). The purpose of the WRRS is to allow the Vendor to manage and document all risks that occur throughout a project. Risk is defined as anything that impacts project cost or project schedule. This includes risks that are caused by the Vendor (or entities contracted by the Vendor), and risks that are caused by the University (scope changes, unforeseen conditions, etc). The University Project Manager may also require the Vendor to document risks that may impact customer or client satisfaction. SUBMISSION The weekly report is an excel file that must be submitted on the Friday of every week. The report is due every week once the Notice To Proceed is issued, and must be submitted every week throughout the duration of the service. Please contact the University PM if you have not received an electronic version of the spreadsheet (once the Notice To Proceed has been issued). The report must be emailed to: Email: cjohnson@uidaho.edu Email: tyroneb@uidaho.edu Email: john.michael@asu.edu The completed report must be saved using the date and name of the project given by the client (Format: YYMMDD_ProjectName_Project ID; For example, 'Polk Project' for the week ending Friday, March 1, 2005, should be labeled '050301_PolkProject_01 123456789'). This will facilitate the UNIVERSITY in analyzing all projects on a weekly basis. Weekly Reports are to be emailed (by midnight C.S.T. of each Friday). ONLINE TUTORIAL A short video tutorial is also available online (www.pbsrg.com) , which provides information on the reporting system. Vendors are required to watch this video prior to completing/submitting the weekly reports. The weekly report consists of scope changes or unforeseen events that are risks to the project in terms of cost, schedule, or client satisfaction including any issues that could potentially develop into a risk. When a new issue is identified, it is added to the project risks, along with the following: Identification date (date the risk was identified), plan to minimize the risk, resolution due date, impact to critical path or schedule (in days), and impact to final cost (in dollars). Prior to submitting the report, the Vendor must contact the University Project Manager if there are any risks or potential risks identified. The University Project Manager is required to provide a satisfaction ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 71 rating based on the identified risk and the Vendors plan to mitigate the risk. The rating is based on a scale of 110 (10 being completely satisfied and 1 being completely dissatisfied). The University Project Manager may modify their satisfaction ratings at any time throughout the project. When a risk is resolved, the actual date of resolution must be listed. The Vendor is also required to submit a detailed project schedule (including the Notice To Proceed date, Substantial completion date, and Final completion date) in the weekly report. The schedule report must contain the Vendors original schedule along with the current estimated schedule. Note: The Weekly Reports will be analyzed for accuracy and timely submittals by the University Project Manager. Upon completion of the project, the Vendor will be evaluated based on their performance on the project. This includes (but is not limited to): overall quality, ontime completion, no cost change orders, no complaints, and submission of accurate weekly reports. The final rating will be used to modify the Vendors Teams PPI scores by up to 50%. The modified rating will be used for competition on future projects. ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 72 UI 670 Attachment A Request for Proposal 09-58J Dining Services Addendum 1 Answers to Questions: 1. Q: Within the document on page 47 it list reference must be provided for the following: Vendor On Site GM Regional VP Executive Chef Catering Director. It was my understanding that since the PBSRG group was already in possession of the company reference information, that additional references would not be required for the VENDOR. A: The University of Idaho is implementing the PIPS best-value system for the procurement and management of Dining Services. Vendors that have participated in this process are not required to re-submit Past Performance Information on the firm or critical individuals as long as they have a current database on file with the PBSRG. To identify if your firm and/or critical individuals have current Past Performance Information on record, you can visit the website ( www.pbsrg.com ) or email John Michael at John.Michael@asu.edu . 2. Q: Per page 48, above referenced RFP the instructions are to go to www.pbsrg.com for PPI Database Template. The University of Idaho IS NOT on this site as described, and it is not under the State Of Idaho Tab. A: Attached is the Dining Reference List. All the documents are available on the PBSRG website , which can be found at the following address. http://www.pbsrg.com/pips/curren t/uidaho/pilots/dining-service/ 3. Q: Page 33 section 1.7 references Future dining locations. Which Campus Bookstore would you like an evaluation of a potential coffee shop, and can we get any idea of timing of \"Potential for new Alumni Visitors Center retail food component\" as well as location of the same. A: The University is considering a selfop coffee concept at the main bookstore location or future main bookstore location. At this time a potential new Alumni Visitor Center is just a concept. The University does not foresee this happening any earlier than two to three years from now. The University wanted to include this potential as it may occur during the contemplated term of this RFP. 4: Q: Page 33 section 1.8 last Bullet: Is it the University's plan to bring retail or concessions companies onto campus after requiring minimum commissions through this process? A: This is a possibility if the vendor underperforms or chooses to close an operation. The University wants to have the option to go out separately.

Contractor requests the following provisions included in the resultant Agreement: Condition of Premises and Equipment. The Premises and equipment provided by University for use in the Food Service operation shall be in good condition and maintained by University to ensure compliance with applicable laws concerning building conditions, sanitation, safety and health (including, without limitation, OSHA regulations).

Do not list any names/information that can be used to identify your firm. Do not exceed the 2page limit. Exhibit 2, Section 1 - Client Expectations as stated in RFP Sustainability We will support local businesses by purchasing 12.5% of food within Latah County, and 71% within the Inland Northwest. We estimate the pre and postconsumer waste stream will equal approximately 100 tons, and we will redirect and reduce this stream by 90% or more through composting, pulping, utilizing compostable and reusable service ware and improving sustainable products and packaging sourcing. Our dining services fleet will consist of Bio Fuel capable vehicles. The operating cost of these initiatives is included in our proposal and will be in place by August 2010. Annual Financial Contributions to UI We will exceed the minimum annual contribution requirement by driving meal plan participation through mandatory freshman board, Meal Equivalency and Flex Dollars. We will provide monetary contributions to the University via commissions of 17.5% ($3,755,025) and 18.4% ($10,838,841) in the 2 year and 5year terms respectively. In addition, the Vendor will fund $65,000 per year in the 2year model and $50,000 per year in the 5year model for \"annual funds\" which will be used for small equipment replacement and student organization event support. Our monetary contributions and any proposed capital are based on all capital projects (listed in 1.3) being completed before August 15, 2010. Our proposal strategy is to maximize revenue to the University so that these funds can be used for capital reinvestment in the dining program. Effective July 1, 2010 Included in our proposal is a fulltime Maintenance and Repair Technician. Our small equipment and repair budget is $182,838. We will conduct twice annual equipment audits to determine preventative maintenance, repair and replacement needs. The audits will be proactive and provide cost avoidance and reduce potential down time. Capital Contributions Through the addition of meal equivalency, renovations and investments in retail, we will maximize annual monetary contributions and reinvestment income to the University which will enable future University funding of Bob's Place renovations. Retail will be profitable. 2year term No Vendor Capital: Vendor will fund $65,000 per year in annual funds as well as pay to the University monetary contributions (commissions) of 17.5% ($3,755,025) for the term. 5year term -Vendor will provide $500,000 in capital funding; Vendor will fund $50,000 per year in Annual Funds as well as pay to the University monetary contributions (commissions) of 18.4% ($10,838,841) for the term. Both the 2year and 5year term agreements will require a $1.0M capital expenditure in the summer of 2010. The capital expenditure of $1.0M in the 2year model will be 100% University funded; the capital expenditure of $1.0M in the 5year model will be $500K vendor capital and $500K University funded capital for: Denny's at 6th Street $450K; Traders Market 6th Street $100K; J Street at the Commons Food Court $300K; Einstein's at Common Grounds $150K. Renovations will be planned, funded and completed by August 15, 2010. These enhancements to the dining program are based on quantifiable market research data and directly address consumer behavior and expectations on ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 96 the UI campus. Customer Success Approach Through our extensive proprietary research on consumer behaviors, needs and desires, we have identified 5 distinct consumer segments on the campus. Our proposal reflects these findings and is backed by our research. Nationally, we as a company invest over $1M annually in market research, industry data and proprietary research in order to meet and exceed consumer expectations. We will conduct focus groups, monthly dining committee meetings and develop RA and SGA relationships. We will formally survey dining satisfaction twice annually. We will implement a customer experience program that drives excellent customer service by rewarding and recognizing positive service behaviors. Employee \"huddles\" will be held twice daily in each dining location and will address specific customer service needs as well as recognize outstanding employee service. We have the only formal employee participative customer service model in the industry. All initiatives will be effective by August 2010. Through the addition of meal equivalency, board students will now have 8 new retail locations with a total of 14 dining options available for use with board plans. The enhanced quality, flexibility, choice and convenience will drive satisfaction. We have also used the latest EBI scores as well as our recent research data as key drivers for our proposed service enhancements. We will achieve a 5.5 or better by the Fall of 2010. Sanitation and Cleanliness Effective 7110 Sanitation, cleanliness and safety will be maintained at a very high level through S/S daily job assignments for every employee and daily inspections for every location. We will have an annual NSF, as well as company conducted, physical safety and food safety audits. The management team will use the NSF audit guidelines for all monthly inspections. We will have zero tolerance for rodent and pest activity. General Expectations The addition of J Street, Einstein's and Denny's will enhance the student experience by offering over 150 new menu items covering multiple day parts in key locations across campus. J Street also provides more options for \"Board Plan Meal Equivalence\" on that end of campus. These venues will also provide attractive and inviting seating and atmosphere to create a place to hangout, relax and build the students sense of community. With over 10 locations across campus, addressing all day parts and customer segments, including 2 nationally recognized retail brands, campus dining will be an asset to campus recruitment activities. The flexibility of the enhanced board plans and the afore mentioned sustainability initiatives will exceed this client expectation. Our proposal includes competitive and high quality catering for all events and will be heavily focused on quality, service and sustainability as core components. Staff participation in both retail and board dining will be at 50% each week. Exhibit 2 / Section 2 Our proposal includes provisions that will enable us to meet or exceed all minimum desired expectations set forth in this section of the RFP. ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 97 ATTACHMENT E RAVA PLAN TEMPLATE This template must be used. Modifications to the format of this template will result in disqualification (i.e. altering font size, altering font type, adding colors, adding pictures, etc). You may add/delete additional rows to identify additional risks, solutions, and value added options, but do not exceed the 2page limit. SECTION 1 - MAJOR RISKS All cost impacts associated with these risks/solutions must be included in your proposed premium Risk 1: Enrollment decline Solution: Our overall financial return to the University is based on current enrollment trends. However, if an enrollment decline occurs, this could jeopardize our ability to deliver at the proposed levels. To mitigate this risk, we would increase our targeted marketing to all nonrequired meal plan holders and to local apartment complexes in an effort to gain meal capture from these groups. This would be done in conjunction with increased retail offerings, highlighting convenience and value pricing, to drive additional addon sales to our current customers. Based on our experience with current clients in a decreasing or stagnant enrollment environment, we have been able to drive the average check of current customers by 7%. At one particular university, through our targeted marketing activities with apartment complexes, we were able to add an additional 500 students to the voluntary meal plan program. Risk 2: Campus impacted by natural or manmade disaster Solution: Our Corporate Risk Management Team and Communications departments will respond quickly and decisively in accordance with an existing detailed crisis plan developed for the University of Idaho. We will activate a Crisis Control Team that will handle all decisions and minimize meetings and timeconsuming decision making for the University. In essence, we would take over, handle the crisis, and communicate to both our customers and the University in a timely and efficient manner. We have a wealth of experience in handling these types of situations. SECTION 2 - VALUE ADDED OPTIONS All cost impacts associated with these value added options must NOT be included in your premium. Item 1: Integrated meal plan strategy with offcampus restaurants Impact: Cost ($) 0 Offcampus dining card programs are growing in popularity and have proven to increase student satisfaction, student participation in meal plans, and increases in overall deposits in the allcampus card. Our offcampus group is currently managing over 100 client relationships and delivers the top revenuesharing rates in the industry. By offering this program at University of Idaho, we project an increase in deposits of 15% and a minimum return to the University of $50,000. ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 98 Item 2: Mandatory commuter spending account Impact: Cost ($) 0 In an effort to spread the overall cost of dining throughout the community, we would like to offer an additional meal plan for fulltime offcampus students of $125.00 per semester. This would enable the University to spread the cost of infrastructure to all users of the dining program. We have successfully transitioned two large universities to this model and have increased revenues by over 50%. This plan would generate an additional $1.5 million in revenue, while supplying the University with an additional return of 20%. Item 3: Benchmark for diversity Impact: Cost ($) 0 With us as your organization of choice, you will be gaining the industry leader and the benchmark for diversity best practices, as recognized by companies such as Diversity Inc, Hispanic Business Magazine, LATINA Style Magazine, Black Collegian and Asian Enterprise Magazine. We also incorporate diversity into our dining program, bringing authentic foods and flavors to oncampus dining, creating new and familiar experiences for the broad base of customers that the University of Idaho serves. The University of Idaho will benefit from innovative diversity practices, including training and education as well as access to experts in the field of diversity as it relates to recruitment and retention. Our employee retention and development rates exceed that of the industry, and we bring outstanding resources to the University of Idaho that provide extensive training and career planning to the employees on campus. Our diversity leadership also offers consulting on a variety of topics, including diversity scorecards, benchmarking, diversity education and training. Item 4: Bio Fuel Development Impact: Cost ($) 0 We will develop sustainable Bio Fuel capability and capacity. We will be converting cooking oil into bio diesel fuel to use in our 4 fleet vehicles. The bio diesel fuel can be used in commercial diesel vehicles and has been shown to have significant environmental benefits. We will use special order OEM engines or retro fits that will allow the use of a higher percentage mix bio fuel technology. This fuel technology is the best option at this time given the scarcity or nonexistence of Ultra Low, Super Ultra Low and Zero Emission commercial vehicles in the U.S. Vehicles that are currently available are too small too handle the transport work demands efficiently or will not handle weather and terrain conditions effectively in the winter months. The UI maintenance department already does some cooking oil conversion to bio fuel, and other campus groups are working to improve this process.

Impact if the risk occurs Immediate negative impact on Vendors ability to perform Facility disrepair causes safety and/or sanitation issues forcing closure of operations Increased cost and reduced profitability. Impact could range from $0 to $1,000,000.00 Plan for minimizing the impact if risk occurs Close venue if equipment failure is critical or a safety issue. University and Vendor will implement a communication plan if customers are directly impacted. Vendor will charge university for all operating losses Vendor and University will follow agreement remedies outlined in UI670 3) University actions that change Housing or Enrollment policies, practices or population, building closures, mandated fiscal constraints, staffing reductions, or any other event that materially affects Contractors ability to perform under this agreement. The Risk Revenue and profitability is reduced below vendor proposed levels Plan for avoiding the risk Contractor and University will resolve on a mutually agreed basis. University will keep Vendor informed and Vendor will be engaged in the campus community. Vendor will stay informed on campus initiatives, trends, and University business issues that could impact Food Service. Impact if the risk occurs Significant loss of revenue that risk avoidance does not cure. Impact could be in the range of $0 to $1,500,000 in lost revenue. Plan for minimizing the impact if risk occurs Increase pricing to customers Charge University for losses Parties will work for mutual resolution to mitigate risk factors and timing of impact events ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 145 UI 670 Attachment C Pre-Award Document #5 University Concerns The Vendor should respond to all University concerns. The items listed below are initial concerns that have been addressed. However, it is the Vendors responsibility to ensure that they have addressed any and all other concerns. 1. Dining Plan & Pricing (Board) effect on Housing Performance & Viceversa - The issue here is to not have pricing increases which alter customer behavior in an adverse way. We are noticing that our constituencies are shopping and comparing room and board price more and more (price competitiveness). Sodexo is sensitive to the need for an effective pricing strategy and that recruitment and retention of resident students is critical for all of us. Value perception is also part of the equation, and is a key part of our strategy. Quality, convenience, service, variety, flexibility, atmosphere as well pricing are all part of the value proposition. Our proposal will enhance current meal plans with the addition of meal equivalency, more menu choices and flex dollar rollover options that they currently do not have. The academic year 2010/2011 board prices were increased approx. 3.9% which was less than what the University had anticipated. We have planned for future board plan meal prices to stay in the 6.7% or less increase range each year. We strongly believe based on our research data of the Idaho campus that our planned approach will be effective in continuing to increase EBI dining satisfaction ratings. 2. Operating procedures and processes create undo wear and tear on capital equipment items which damages other areas. This is especially prevalent in the Wallace Complex where the dish room operators fail to clear the drains of food to the point of the floor flooding and damaging goods and equipment in the cstore below which is operated by the Bookstore. How will the vendor address this issue? Operating procedures are currently in place to address routine cleaning of the drains on a daily basis and they have also been added to our preventative maintenance schedule. This should greatly reduce the number of incidents. It we should be noted that we are dealing with an aging infrastructure in the kitchen area so some incidents can potentially occur that no amount of PM will mitigate. To resolve some of this issue, we are resloping and retiling the dishroom floor to improve water flow to the drains and help eliminate leaks to other areas of the building. ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 146 3. Continued declines in customer counts in the Commons Food Court...although average check is up enough to keep gross sales about the same as last year. The customer counts have declined in the food court due to a reduction in operating hours. This reduction in operating hours has reduced operating losses during the nonpeak hours and it has redirected traffic and improved sales at Common Grounds (+9%) and Commons Market (+14%) which are experiencing significant increases in customer counts and profitable sales. The reduction in hours was based on Sodexo's recommendation to improve the profitability of retail which the University had directed us to accomplish. The new changes have been successful in driving increased sales upstairs and improving the average check in the Commons Food Court. 4. Board pricing for FY11 is due within two weeks. Board meal plan pricing for year 2010/2011 has been completed and approved by the University. The increase was 3.9% for 2010/2011. Future board meal plan pricing will be the same as proposed by Sodexo in Addendum 5 / Attachment C for 2011/2012 and as defined in the contractual agreement under Section 9.2. 5. Reduction in amount of proteins offered in Bob's over current levels to contain cost. Sodexo will continue to use high quality ingredients and the quantity and variety of the proteins on our menu's will be the same level or better than currently offered. In addition, students will have dozens of new menu items, including proteins, available to them through meal equivalency options at retail locations on campus such as the new J Street in the Student Union. 6. Risk 7 uses the words \"significant factual errors\". What does the word significant mean in terms of variance (#,$,or %) which would put the vendor and UI into a point of renegotiation? And, does this risk only apply to the first year of the contract as all other projections are owned by the vendor? This question does not apply to Sodexo . 7. Concessions: How does the vendor see this working understanding Exhibit 1.6 states the historic practice of splinting commissions between the Athletic Department and Dining Services? Due to IRS Bond language requirements we cannot \"pay commissions\" to the University. However, the language in the agreement reads that the University will pay Sodexo a portion of Gross Sales on a graduated scale with the excess Gross Sales retained by the University. This accomplishes the same thing as commissions but is worded correctly. Please refer to 8.1 of the agreement for the exact and accurate language description. Sodexo will provide to the University Auxiliary Services Dept. one total invoice every two calendar weeks as outlined in the contract in Section 8.1 AF. No other campus ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 147 groups or departments will receive a payment directly from Sodexo or the Food Service operations Gross Sales. 8. Process to comply with Exhibit 1.14 proposer and university joint assessment of equipment needs and development of addition/replacement schedule. And, process to comply with vendor provided facility and equipment preventative maintenance. Sodexo and the University will conduct a joint assessment of all University owned capital equipment in the spring of each year and identify any major repair or replacement items that need to be addressed by the University. This will also allow for the University to plan each year's annual budget based on projected equipment and facility repairs or replacement needs. The initial joint opening inventory of all University owned equipment prior to the commencement of this agreement will be included in the agreement as Exhibit A. Sodexo will provide routine / preventative maintenance for all University and Vendor owned equipment and will be responsible for replacement and/or repairs of up to $5,000 per occurrence on University owned equipment. Sodexo will also use the $50,000 small equipment replacement funds per year to replace small equipment as needed. The maintenance and small equipment budget is budgeted at $182,000 which is consistent with historical expenditures for the dining services dept. 9. Full understanding of Alcohol Policy and responsibility within that policy. Sodexo is currently following the Alcohol Policy and is in full compliance. We will continue to do so in the future under this new agreement. 10. Interpretation and compliance with all elements of Exhibit 2. Plans to achieve. Sodexo is already meeting these requirements currently as the incumbent Vendor and will continue to do so during the entire term of this agreement. 11. How will the vendor transition the service from the current vendor (so it is seamless to all parties)? Sodexo is the incumbent vendor and as such, we have a tremendous advantage of starting our process implementation and other preparations early. We have submitted a timeline document as part of the PreAward documents that outlines our project and transition action items between now and July 2010. 12. Financial Proposal: Clarification of the pricing assumptions in the proposal for FY11...Board Plans and Prices in particular. The proposed board meal plans ( as shown in Section 6.2 of the agreement) will increase in price each year by an expected amount of up to 6.7% or a CPI index whichever is greater. The price and inflation annual adjustment is further defined in Section 9.2 of the agreement. The board meal plan structure will remain as proposed for the term of the agreement unless mutually agreed changes are made by both parties in writing and amended in the agreement. ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 148 13. Financial Proposal: Proforma losses presented in attachment C page 4. How can they justify these financial losses? Our proforma does not show a loss in any year however the first three years are very modest in profitability due to the $1,500,000.00 capital amortization being front loaded and fully amortized over the first three years. Our profitability is greater in years 4 and 5 but we are also at more risk due to no buyback protection in the final two years. Our ROI modeling is based on the entire 5 year term. The Annual Funds of $420,000 per year in years 4 and 5 are to be expended each year by Sodexo . 14. Financial Proposal: Detail regarding capital investments in both the two and five year proposals to include construction timelines and expected support from UI. The timelines for capital investment projects and transition action items have been provided as part of our PreAward documents and includes any action steps or support needed from the University. 15. Financial Proposal: Item 3 in Value Added Options has a cost of $50,000. How does the vendor see this working? Detail the costs and benefits of this option. And, why was it priced separately and not just included as a true \"value added\" within the proposal? This question does not apply to Sodexo . 16. Financial Proposal: Does Item 4 in Value Added Options mean 30 days of a signed agreement as in 30 days after the SBOE meeting in February? This question does not apply to Sodexo . 17. The University of Idaho is contemplating a sponsorship agreement for 10 years with a 5 year renewal opportunity with a company called Agri Beef. This arrangement could introduce two risks previously not identified in our Dining RFP process: Exclusive vendor for all beef and pork products served in the Kibbie Dome and all associated game day events regardless of location such as the President's tent. Exclusive vendor for all University of Idaho beef and pork products (must be comparable product at comparable/competitive price). It is my understanding that Agri Beef distributes through Sysco. We may be already purchasing some their beef and pork products. Please add this to your risk report with risk mitigation strategy/impact for each. I would appreciate these risks addressed prior to the \"official\" preaward deadline with a due date prior to December 10th. Additionally, please outline the impact to Vandal Brand Meats by telling us the dollar volume and products purchased annually. Potential University of Idaho Imposed Risk to Dining Provider On November 23, 2009 Sodexo received the below request for information: ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 149 \"The University of Idaho is contemplating a sponsorship agreement for 10 years with a 5 year renewal opportunity with a company called Agri Beef. This arrangement could introduce two risks previously not identified in our Dining RFP process: Exclusive vendor for all beef and pork products served in the Kibbie Dome and all associated game day events regardless of location such as the President's tent.

I would appreciate these risks addressed prior to the \"official\" preaward deadline with a due date prior to December 10 th. Additionally, please outline the impact to Vandal Brand Meats by telling us the dollar volume and products purchased annually.\" Sodexo Response: AgriBeef representatives indicated to Sodexo that they are only interested in providing beef products to the University through Sodexo. This eliminates any negative impact to Vandal Meats since we do not use or procure any beef items from them. Why is it a Risk: In regard to the use of AgriBeef products at the main university campus and concessions, the risk of using AgriBeef potentially impacts Sodexo financial income, product pricing competitiveness, product quality specifications, food safety and potential liability to Sodexo. Vendor may not be able or willing to meet Sodexo vendor approval requirements. The impact if not avoided : Product pricing may be higher than Sodexo approved vendors Product quality and specifications may be different than Sodexo approved products AgriBeef may not be able or willing to meet Sodexo vendor approval requirements. Financial impact is estimated at $23,500.00 per year for the Main Campus assuming that we only buy comparable products at comparable prices to Sodexo sources. The financial impact for Concessions is $3,300.00 per year assuming that we only buy comparable products at comparable prices to Sodexo sources. Food safety and liability risks are higher by using AgriBeef versus approved sources. Plan for avoiding and minimizing risk: ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 150 1. University and Sodexo agree to use Sodexo Approved Vendors exclusively which would eliminate AgriBeef from consideration. No Impact. 2. If step (1) is not possible; then Sodexo will require AgriBeef to apply and comply with all Sodexo vendor requirements for inspections, insurance, quality control, payment terms, distribution, etc. This step is a mandatory requirement. 3. If step (2) is completed then Sodexo will procure only those beef products offered by AgriBeef that are comparable beef product specs and comparable pricing to Sodexo suppliers. AgriBeef has offered to Sodexo 19 (see page 3) beef products that could potentially meet our product specification requirements. We estimate a negative financial impact of: Main Campus: $23,500.00 Concessions: $3,300.00 4. If step (3) comparable prices requirement is not applied and University requires Sodexo to utilize all beef products that meet our minimum food specifications regardless of price then the estimated negative financial impact (in addition to step 3 amounts) will be: Main Campus $6,200.00 Annually Concessions $3,200.00 Annually (the above estimates are based on current product price comparison variances, projected volumes and other factors) 5. Under no circumstances will Sodexo purchase or use products that do not meet our minimum quality standards or products and product categories that are specifically banned from operations by Sodexo. ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 151 UI 670 Attachment C Pre-Award Document #6 University of Idaho PreAward Document University Accepted Value Add Item 3: Benchmark for diversity Impact: Cost ($) 0 With us as your organization of choice, you will be gaining the industry leader and the benchmark for diversity best practices, as recognized by companies such as Diversity Inc, Hispanic Business Magazine, LATINA Style Magazine, Black Collegian and Asian Enterprise Magazine. We also incorporate diversity into our dining program, bringing authentic foods and flavors to oncampus dining, creating new and familiar experiences for the broad base of customers that the University of Idaho serves. The University of Idaho will benefit from innovative diversity practices, including training and education as well as access to experts in the field of diversity as it relates to recruitment and retention. Our employee retention and development rates exceed that of the industry, and we bring outstanding resources to the University of Idaho that provide extensive training and career planning to the employees on campus. Our diversity leadership also offers consulting on a variety of topics, including diversity scorecards, benchmarking, diversity education and training. Item 4: Bio Fuel Development Impact: Cost ($) 0 We will develop sustainable Bio Fuel capability and capacity. We will be converting cooking oil into bio diesel fuel to use in our 4 fleet vehicles. The bio diesel fuel can be used in commercial diesel vehicles and has been shown to have significant environmental benefits. We will use special order OEM engines or retro fits that will allow the use of a higher percentage mix bio fuel technology. This fuel technology is the best option at this time given the scarcity or non ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 152 existence of Ultra Low, Super Ultra Low and Zero Emission commercial vehicles in the U.S. Vehicles that are currently available are too small too handle the transport work demands efficiently or will not handle weather and terrain conditions effectively in the winter months. The UI maintenance department already does some cooking oil conversion to bio fuel, and other campus groups are working to improve this process.

April 2008 Board approved LCSC's request to sell the York House (504 6 th Ave) after the College terminated Hospitality Mgt lab operati ons at that location. December 2008 Board appr oved LCSC's request to sell the houses at 508 and 512 6th Ave after a potential buyer had expressed interest in the possibility of buying all three properties as a package\u2014approval was contingent upon later Board approval of terms, when offers were received. April 2009 Board approved LCSC sale of house at 512 6 th Ave. APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governi ng Policies & Procedures, Sections V.I.1 BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION This property, located one block north of the Lewis-C lark State College (LCSC) Lewiston campus, was purchased in 20 05 as part of a package of three properties which included the \"York House,\" a former bed-and-breakfast operation used until the end of the Spring 2008 semester as a training laboratory for students in LCSC's Hospitality Manage ment program. The subject property at 508 6th Ave has been used as a rental since its acquis ition by t he College in 2005. When LCSC ended Hosp itality Management lab oper ations at the York house, it received permission from the Board to sell t he three properties either separately or as package. Sale of the house at 512 6th Ave was approved by the Board in April 2009. The main \"York House\" unit at 504 6th Ave remains on the market. LCSC has received an offe r for $115K for the house at 508 6th Ave, and has accepted the offer, subject to Board approval of the terms. The subject property was appraised for $84K in 2005 prior to its purchase by LCSC as part of the package of three properties. When the decision was made to sell the three houses, LCSC had the property reappraised in June 2008 (prior to the sharp market slump accompany ing the national/reg ional economic downturn) and the appraised val ue for the property at 508 6 th Ave was $108K. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 8 Page 2 The pending buyer and LCSC have agreed on a price of $115K, as indicated in the Purchase Sales Agreement found at Attachment 4. IMPACT Sale of the subject property, which lies outside LCSC's proj ected development zone and does not contribute to primar y mission programs, makes financial sense for the College. Sale of the property would obvi ate the need for future repairs to the aging struct ure, which would exceed t he minimal rent amounts collected from tenants. Pr oceeds from sale of th e property will be used to support the College's core mission areas. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Overhead diagram s howing location of property Page 3 Attachment 2 - Photos of house Page 4 Attachment 3 - Appraisal of property in 2008 (prior to listing) Page 5 Attachment 4 - Purchase Sa le Agreement Page 21 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Sale of the real property and structur e in question has been envisioned by the College since December 2008. The property is outside the College's expansion zone and does not currently serve any pr ogrammatic needs of the College. The College has an offer on the property in e xcess of the appraised value. Sale of the property will provide revenue to the College in a time of fiscal austerity. Staff recommends approval. BOARD ACTION A motion to approve the request by Lewis-Cla rk State College to sell the property located at 508 6 th Avenue, Lewiston, Idaho, fo r $115,000, and to authorize LCSC's Vice-President fo r Finance and Administrati on to sign all necessary documents to complete the sale on behalf of the State Board of Education in its capacity as the Board of Tr ustees for the College.

The purchase price is an allocation of value from a larger sale which included 504, 508 and 512 6th Ave. The total purchase price for all three properties was $460,000. Therefore, the purchase price of $95,000 may not have accurately reflected the market value of the subject property at that time. None of the comparable sales have transferred in 1 year prior to the dates given. Neither the subject property or any of the comparable sales are currently subject to sale or listing agreements. There have been several sales over the past year with some similarity to the subject property in size, age, condition, utility and function. Comparable sales # 1, 2 , 3 and 4 are the most recent and similar to the subject property. Comparable sale # 5 was added in order to bolster the opinion of value indicated by the first four comparable sales. Comparable sales # 1 and # 2 and # 4 are the most similar to the subject property and required the least amount of adjustment.

Page 3 of 6 Freddie Mac Form 70 March 2005 Fannie Mae Form 1004 March 2005RL5591 HIGHEST AND BEST USE: The current residential use of the subject property is legal, physically possible, financially feasible and appropriately supported. It is the appraiser's opinion that the \"highest and best use\" of the subject property is residential. MARKET DATA: The comparable sales used in the Sales Comparison Approach for the subject property were the most recent in the subject market area with some similarity to the subject property. Following is a general discussion of the adjustments made in the Sales Comparison Approach. Adjustments are based on the appraiser's analysis of recent residential sales in the subject market area. SUBJECT: The subject property consists of a 6,390 sq. ft. site with a 1 Story residence on a full unfinished basement area. Upon observation the appraiser noted that the subject foundation and the subject roof are showing some signs of wear and tear associated with age and use. The subject roof appears to have little remaining economic life and a roof inspection needs to be completed in order to determine if the subject roof has outlived it's useful life and should be replaced. While observing the basement area the appraiser noted evidence of possible flooding or other water intrusion in previous years. There were water stains on the floors as well as wood pallets, which would be used to raise personal items off of the level of the ground due to flooding. It was also evident that the original Stone Masonry foundation had been sealed at one point in time with a poured concrete facia and that the seal was now beginning to deteriorate which would allow for possible water intrusion. As well, the appraiser noted that the window wells on the exterior of the residence for the basement windows are not below the level of the base of the windows. This allows rain water to pool in the bottom of the window well and seep through the window sill into the basement. Therefore, this appraisal report is subject to a home inspection, in particular the roof and foundation. COMPARABLE 1: The comparable residence is newer, however, it shows similar signs of wear and tear associated with age and use. Living area was adjusted at $25 per sq. ft. and rounded to the nearest $50. Unfinished basement area was adjusted at $7 per sq. ft. and rounded to the nearest $50. Finished basement area was adjusted at $12 per sq. ft. and rounded to the nearest $50. The comparable property has a garage which provides additional enclosed storage and work space. COMPARABLE 2: Upon analysis of recent residential site sales in the market area the appraiser determined that an adjustment was necessary for the comparable's smaller site. No adjustment was necessary for above grade living area or unfinished basement area as they are similar in size, utility and function to the subject's living and unfinished basement areas. The comparable property has an under ground sprinkler system and storage shed. COMPARABLE 3: Site was adjusted as before. The comparable residence has recently received several updates and shows less wear and tear associated with age and use. Living and unfinished basement areas were adjusted as before. The comparable's exterior improvements are larger and more functional. The comparable residence does not have a secondary heat source which is more functional for year round use. The comparable property has a storage shed. COMPARABLE 4: All adjustments were made as described before. COMPARABLE 5: All adjustments were made as described before. The most recent residential site sales with similarity to the subject site in location, access, topography and utility for development would have a dollar per square foot range of $2.38 to $4.50. The subject site has an average location, level topography average access and utility as it is an interior lot with alley access. Therefore, the appraiser has determined that the subject site would have a dollar per square foot value of approximately $4.25 or $27,150 Marshall and Swift Cost Handbook Average 12/200627,150 919 82.13 Fence, Water, Sewer, Porches 115,729Site value is based upon the analysis given above. Cost was developed from Marshall & Swift Cost Manual, adjusted by the appraiser's files and with local cost data obtained through discussions with local contractors. Physical depreciation is based on the age/life method and adjusted for the local market.

This report form is not designed to report an appraisal of a manufactured home or a unit in a condominium or cooperative project. This appraisal report is subject to the following scope of work, intended use, intended user, definition of market value, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. Modifications, additions, or deletions to the intended use, intended user, definition of market value, or assumptions and limiting conditions are not permitted. The appraiser may expand the scope of work to include any additional research or analysis necessary based on the complexity of this appraisal assignment. Modifications or deletions to the certifications are also not permitted. However, additional certifications that do not constitute material alterations to this appraisal report, such as those required by law or those related to the appraiser's continuing education or membership in an appraisal organization, are permitted. SCOPE OF WORK: The scope of work for this appraisal is defined by the complexity of this appraisal assignment and the reporting requirements of this appraisal report form, including the following definition of market value, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. The appraiser must, at a minimum: (1) perform a complete visual inspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject property, (2) inspect the neighborhood, (3) inspect each of the comparable sales from at least the street, (4) research, verify, and analyze data from reliable public and/or private sources, and (5) report his or her analysis, opinions, and conclusions in this appraisal report. INTENDED USE: The intended use of this appraisal report is for the lender/client to evaluate the property that is the subject of this appraisal for a mortgage finance transaction. INTENDED USER: The intended user of this appraisal report is the lender/client. DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE: The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: (1) buyer and seller are typically motivated; (2) both parties are well informed or well advised, and each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest; (3) a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; (4) payment is made in terms of cash in U. S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and (5) the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions* granted by anyone associated with the sale. *Adjustments to the comparables must be made for special or creative financing or sales concessions. No adjustments are necessary for those costs which are normally paid by sellers as a result of tradition or law in a market area; these costs are readily identifiable since the seller pays these costs in virtually all sales transactions. Special or creative financing adjustments can be made to the comparable property by comparisons to financing terms offered by a third party institutional lender that is not already involved in the property or transaction. Any adjustment should not be calculated on a mechanical dollar for dollar cost of the financing or concession but the dollar amount of any adjustment should approximate the market's reaction to the financing or concessions based on the appraiser's judgment. STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS: The appraiser's certification in this report is subject to the following assumptions and limiting conditions: 1.The appraiser will not be responsible for matters of a legal nature that affect either the property being appraised or the title to it, except for information that he or she became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. The appraiser assumes that the title is good and marketable and will not render any opinions about the title. 2.The appraiser has provided a sketch in this appraisal report to show the approximate dimensions of the improvements. The sketch is included only to assist the reader in visualizing the property and understanding the appraiser's determination of its size. 3.The appraiser has examined the available flood maps that are provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or other data sources) and has noted in this appraisal report whether any portion of the subject site is located in an identified Special Flood Hazard Area. Because the appraiser is not a surveyor, he or she makes no guarantees, express or implied, regarding this determination. 4.The appraiser will not give testimony or appear in court because he or she made an appraisal of the property in question, unless specific arrangements to do so have been made beforehand, or as otherwise required by law. 5.The appraiser has noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, etc.) observed during the inspection of the subject property or that he or she became aware of during the research involved in performing the appraisal. Unless otherwise stated in this appraisal report, the appraiser has no knowledge of any hidden or unapparent physical deficiencies or adverse conditions of the property (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, adverse environmental conditions, etc.) that would make the property less valuable, and has assumed that there are no such conditions and makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied. The appraiser will not be responsible for any such conditions that do exist or for any engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions exist. Because the appraiser is not an expert in the field of environmental hazards, this appraisal report must not be considered as an environmental assessment of the property. 6.The appraiser has based his or her appraisal report and valuation conclusion for an appraisal that is subject to satisfactory completion, repairs, or alterations on the assumption that the completion, repairs, or alterations of the subject property will be performed in a professional manner.

The sketch is included only to assist the reader in visualizing the property and understanding the appraiser's determination of its size. 3.The appraiser has examined the available flood maps that are provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or other data sources) and has noted in this appraisal report whether any portion of the subject site is located in an identified Special Flood Hazard Area. Because the appraiser is not a surveyor, he or she makes no guarantees, express or implied, regarding this determination. 4.The appraiser will not give testimony or appear in court because he or she made an appraisal of the property in question, unless specific arrangements to do so have been made beforehand, or as otherwise required by law. 5.The appraiser has noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, etc.) observed during the inspection of the subject property or that he or she became aware of during the research involved in performing the appraisal. Unless otherwise stated in this appraisal report, the appraiser has no knowledge of any hidden or unapparent physical deficiencies or adverse conditions of the property (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, adverse environmental conditions, etc.) that would make the property less valuable, and has assumed that there are no such conditions and makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied. The appraiser will not be responsible for any such conditions that do exist or for any engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions exist. Because the appraiser is not an expert in the field of environmental hazards, this appraisal report must not be considered as an environmental assessment of the property. 6.The appraiser has based his or her appraisal report and valuation conclusion for an appraisal that is subject to satisfactory completion, repairs, or alterations on the assumption that the completion, repairs, or alterations of the subject property will be performed in a professional manner.

I verified, from a disinterested source, all information in this report that was provided by parties who have a financial interest in the sale or financing of the subject property. 11. I have knowledge and experience in appraising this type of property in this market area. 12. I am aware of, and have access to, the necessary and appropriate public and private data sources, such as multiple listing services, tax assessment records, public land records and other such data sources for the area in which the property is located. 13. I obtained the information, estimates, and opinions furnished by other parties and expressed in this appraisal report from reliable sources that I believe to be true and correct. 14. I have taken into consideration the factors that have an impact on value with respect to the subject neighborhood, subject property, and the proximity of the subject property to adverse influences in the development of my opinion of market value. I have noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, adverse environmental conditions, etc.) observed during the inspection of the subject property or that I became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal.

My employment and/or compensation for performing this appraisal or any future or anticipated appraisals was not conditioned on any agreement or understanding, written or otherwise, that I would report (or present analysis supporting) a predetermined specific value, a predetermined minimum value, a range or direction in value, a value that favors the cause of any party, or the attainment of a specific result or occurrence of a specific subsequent event (such as approval of a pending mortgage loan application). 19. I personally prepared all conclusions and opinions about the real estate that were set forth in this appraisal report. If I relied on significant real property appraisal assistance from any individual or individuals in the performance of this appraisal or the preparation of this appraisal report, I have named such individual(s) and disclosed the specific tasks performed in this appraisal report. I certify that any individual so named is qualified to perform the tasks. I have not authorized anyone to make a change to any item in this appraisal report; therefore, any change made to this appraisal is unauthorized and I will take no responsibility for it. 20. I identified the lender/client in this appraisal report who is the individual, organization, or agent for the organization that ordered and will receive this appraisal report.

APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Educat ion Governing Policies & Pr ocedures, Sections V.I.1. through V.I.2. (\"Acquisition of Real Property\") BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION For the past nine years, LCSC has pur sued a long-term objective to expand parking on the eastern, western, and s outhern perimeters of its Normal Hill campus. LCSC's projects to acquire pr operty on which to site additional parking lots and other new facilities have been complemented by efforts to divest college-owned properties which now lie outside of LCSC's projected growth axis. The subject property at 1023 6 th Street lies directly opposite the Harris Field baseball complex. Acquisition of this property, located among five lots already owned by the college (see Attachment 1), would set the stage for the continuation of parki ng expansion along 6 th Street, which began in conjunction with the construction of LCSC's Activity Center in 2003. The property was purchased by its cu rrent owners in 2008, and has been used as a student rental. The house on the western side of the lot was heavily damaged by fire in November 2009. The ow ners continue to live in a separate, small apartment on the east side of the lo t. Having collected insurance payments for the fire damages, the owner s are willing to sell the enti re property to LCSC in a \"as is\" condition (thereby avoiding the nec essity of rebuilding and reselling the property). Subject to Boar d approval, LCSC has offer ed to purchase the property for $102,500 and to allow the current owners to rent the sma ll apartment on the rear of the lot (the owner anticipates departure at the end of the next academic year, upon completion of coursework at LCSC). Following completion of the sale, LCSC will begin planning to demolish the fire- damaged house on the we st side of the lot and contin ue to operate the rear unit as a rental until the entire section of coll ege-owned lots is converted to additional parking as part of the 6 th Street parking expansion. IMPACT Acquisition of this property will be financ ed through use of LCSC working capital. It makes sense for LCSC to acquire the property now for a significantly reduced rate, vis-\u00e0-vis the likely cost (in excess of $200K) if the college were to delay action, and then have to bid for the pr operty in several years, following completion of repairs.

The home was seriously damaged by fire late last year, and the owners are willing to sell the property in \"as-is\" condition. While the offering price is slightly above appraised value, taken as a whole it constitutes a very reasonable and ben eficial transaction for the College. Acquisition of this property, located among five lots already owned by the College, would facilitate continua tion of parking expansion along 6th Street. Staff recommends approval. BOARD ACTION A motion to approve the request by Lewis- Clark State College to purchase the property at 1023 6th St., Lewiston, Idaho, for $102, 500; and to authorize LCSC's Vice-President for Finance and Administrati on to sign all necessary paperwork to complete the purchase, acting on behalf of the State Board of Education as Trustees of the College.

The purpose of this appraisal is to estimate the market value of the subject property's fee simple interest for potential acquisition. This appraisal is intended for the use of the client and the client's advisors. The accompanying summary report of an appraisal has been completed in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and applicable Federal regulations. The attached report details the scope of the appraisal, level of reporting, definition of value, valuation methodology, and pertinent data researched and analyzed in the development of this appraisal. I certify that I have no present or contemplated future interest in the property beyond this estimate of value. Your attention is directed to the Limiting Conditions and Assumptions page. Acceptance of this report constitutes an agreement with these conditions and assumptions. One complication of this assignment is that the home has been severely damaged by fire. No competing properties were found with similar condition. Therefore, the analysis values the subject as if repaired and then subtracts from that the approximate amount that I conclude would be required to bring it to the repaired condition to arrive at an opinion of market value as the property existed on the date of value, January 6, 2010, was $95,000.

Prior to the fire, the primary home was rented by the bedroom with the kitchen, baths, family, living, & dining room shared by all occupants. The bedrooms were rented at rates ranging from $275 to $400 each per month. Including the owner as an additional bedroom at the upper rate indicates a monthly rent of $2,450. Market rents in the neighborhood were found ranging from $196 to 425 per bedroom. I conclude the prior existing subject rent is reasonable. Gross annual multipliers found for multi-family units ranged from 89 to 106. The GAM for single family units is substantially higher. However, as the subject was utilized, the multi-family comparisons appear most reflective of market expectations for the subject's income stream & as a non-conforming use it is expected that toward the lower end of the range is reasonable. 210,000 196,286 232,750 Primary weight is placed on the sales comparison approach with secondary weight placed on the income approach. The cost approach is considered unreliable overall due to: the age of the structure, the number of times renovated/remodeled during its life, and the non-conformance issue. The value of the subject as if all fire damage had been repaired and condition was good is concluded to be $215,000. The attached cost pages summarize the estimated impact on value of the fire damage which is subtracted from the 'as if' repaired conclusion above to arrive at an 'as is' market value for the subject. The estimated cost to place the subject in repaired good condition is approximately $120,000.

It has been utilized as an informal residence for students, each renting a bedroom and together using the kitchens, baths, and other rooms in common. This is relatively unusual for this neighborhood and no recent sales were found of homes being utilized in this manner were found. The comparables are all single family dwellings closed in the past year that bracket the subject's age and gross living area. The subject has an auxiliary unit, mother in law apartment structure on the rear of the site. While no current sales were found with this particular amenity, several historical sales with this amenity were identified and they appear to have contributed a value to the overall property of between 5 and 15%. The middle of this range is concluded reasonable and applied to the subject. Comp #2 has an added amenity, a swimming pool, that is judged the most equivalent value substitute found although appealing to a different buyer base. This amenity combined with its large below grade bedroom count results in adjustment level higher than desired, but unavoidable. The comparables were adjusted to the subject as follows: Adjustment Amount Description Time Market pricing appears stable over 2 year period Location No adjustment judged necessary Site $25,000 Per acre for significant size differences View No adjustment judged necessary Quality No adjustment judged necessary Design No adjustment judged necessary Age $200 Based on differences in physical age.

The appraiser assumes that the title is good and marketable and, therefore, will not render any opinions about the title. The property is appraised on the basis of it being under responsible ownership. \u2014 The appraiser may have provided a sketch in the appraisal report to show approximate dimensions of the improvements, and any such sketch is included only to assist the reader of the report in visualizing the property and understanding the appraiser's determination of its size. Unless otherwise indicated, a Land Survey was not performed. \u2014 If so indicated, the appraiser has examined the available flood maps that are provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or other data sources) and has noted in the appraisal report whether the subject site is located in an identified Special Flood Hazard Area. Because the appraiser is not a surveyor, he or she makes no guarantees, express or implied, regarding this determination. \u2014 The appraiser will not give testimony or appear in court because he or she made an appraisal of the property in question, unless specific arrangements to do so have been made beforehand. \u2014 If the cost approach is included in this appraisal, the appraiser has estimated the value of the land in the cost approach at its highest and best use, and the improvements at their contributory value. These separate valuations of the land and improvements must not be used in conjunction with any other appraisal and are invalid if they are so used. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, the cost approach value is not an insurance value, and should not be used as such. \u2014 The appraiser has noted in the appraisal report any adverse conditions (including, but not limited to, needed repairs, depreciation, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, etc.) observed during the inspection of the subject property, or that he or she became aware of during the normal research involved in performing the appraisal. Unless otherwise stated in the appraisal report, the appraiser has no knowledge of any hidden or unapparent conditions of the property, or adverse environmental conditions (including, but not limited to, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, etc.) that would make the property more or less valuable, and has assumed that there are no such conditions and makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied, regarding the condition of the property. The appraiser will not be responsible for any such conditions that do exist or for any engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions exist. Because the appraiser is not an expert in the field of environmental hazards, the appraisal report must not be considered as an environmental assessment of the property. \u2014 The appraiser obtained the information, estimates, and opinions that were expressed in the appraisal report from sources that he or she considers to be reliable and believes them to be true and correct. The appraiser does not assume responsibility for the accuracy of such items that were furnished by other parties. \u2014 The appraiser will not disclose the contents of the appraisal report except as provided for in the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, and any applicable federal, state or local laws. \u2014 If this appraisal is indicated as subject to satisfactory completion, repairs, or alterations, the appraiser has based his or her appraisal report and valuation conclusion on the assumption that completion of the improvements will be performed in a workmanlike manner. \u2014 An appraiser's client is the party (or parties) who engage an appraiser in a specific assignment. Any other party acquiring this report from the client does not become a party to the appraiser-client relationship.

As part of the valuation process, the appraiser performs a non-invasive visual inventory that is not intended to reveal defects or detrimental conditions that are not readily apparent. The presence of such conditions or defects could adversely affect the appraiser's opinion of value.

Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: 1. Buyer and seller are typically motivated; 2. Both parties are well informed or well advised and acting in what they consider their own best interests; 3. A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; 4. Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and 5. The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale. * This definition is from regulations published by federal regulatory agencies pursuant to Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989 between July 5, 1990, and August 24, 1990, by the Federal Reserve System (FRS), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). This definition is also referenced in regulations jointly published by the OCC, OTS, FRS, and FDIC on June 7, 1994, and in the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines, dated October 27, 1994.

Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: 1. Buyer and seller are typically motivated; 2. Both parties are well informed or well advised and acting in what they consider their own best interests; 3. A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; 4. Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and 5. The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale. * This definition is from regulations published by federal regulatory agencies pursuant to Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989 between July 5, 1990, and August 24, 1990, by the Federal Reserve System (FRS), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).

It is impo rtant to note the ratios are designed as a management t ool to measure financial activity and trends within an institution. They do not lend themselves to comparative analysis between institutions because of the varying missions and current initiatives taking place at a given institution. Ratio Measure Benchmark Primary reserve Sufficiency of resources and their flexibility; good measure for net assets .40 Viability Capacity to r epay total debt through reserves 1.25 Return on net assets Whether the institution is better off financially this year than last 6.00% Net operating revenues Whether institution is living within available resources 2.00% Composite Index Combines four ratios using weighting 3.0 The financial ratio selected to indicate e fficiency is the Instructional Cost per Credit Hour. This number is calculated by dividing the instructional costs by both the un-weighted and weighted credit hours. Weighted credit hou rs are included to account for the differing costs to deliver those credits. The same weights are used in the Enrollment Workload Adjustm ent (EWA) formula to provide more EWA funding for the higher weighted courses. Finally, the history of net asset balances is shown from FY 2002 through FY 2009. Each institution's financial information is contained in a separ ate section. The institutions will present a brief analysis of the information and be available for questions by the Board. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 10 Page 2 IMPACT The ratios and analyses are provided in order for the Board to review the financial health of each institution and to show the relative efficiency of its instructional programs. The net asse t balances history shows the change in balances from FY 2002 through FY 2009. The net assets are broken down as follows: Invested in capital assets, net of related debt: This represents the University's total investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and outstanding debt obligations related to those capital assets. To the extent debt has been incurred but not yet expended for capital assets, such amounts are not included. Restricted, expendable This represents resources in which the University is legally or contractually obligated to spend resources in accordance with restrictions imposed by external third parties. Restricted, nonexpendable This represents endowment and similar type funds in which donors or other outside sources have stipulated, as a condition of the gift instrument, that the principal is to be maintained inviolate and in perpetuity, and invested for the purpose of producing present and future income, which may either be expended or added to principal. Unrestricted This represents resources derived from student fees, state appropriations, and sales and services of educational departments and auxiliary enterprises. These resources also include auxiliary enterprises, which are substantially self-supporting activities that provide services for students, faculty and staff. Not all source of revenues noted above are necessarily present in the unrestricted balance, i.e. state General Funds are normally spent in the fiscal year appropriated, and not carried over into the following fiscal year. Within unrestricted net assets, the instit utions reserve funds for the following: Various Department Fund Balances: Department Fund Balances are derived from operations for such areas as Auxiliaries, Academic and Service De partments, Research, and Professional-Technical Education. These funds are held to be used in t heir respective departments, but can and have been used for any purpose at the discr etion of the institution. Reserved for Library Acquisitions: These funds are used to assist in the acquisition and replacement of library materials and to stay abreast of tec hnology changes in the way the library is accessed and used. These funds can and have been used for any purpose at the discretion of the institution. Reserved for Capital Projects, M&O, and Initiatives: These funds are reserved for capital projects, ongoing maintenance, facility repair and replacement, and start-up costs related to strategic mission. These funds can and have been used for any purpose at the discretion of the institution.

An increase in unrestricted net assets and the amount of unres tricted net assets per student FTE can be viewed in comparis on to the primary reserve ratio. Some institutions have increased their reserves but they are still under the benchmark of .40. This may be due to the fact they are building reserves to be more in line with industry standards. You c an compare this to an institution that continues to increase their reserves at the same time they are well above the benchmark of .40 The cost of instruction per credit hour, adjusted for inflat ion, reflects that some institutions are experiencing increasing costs for instruction while others are relatively flat or declining. Variati ons in costs per credit hour may be due to several factors including changes in enro llment and the corresponding ability to adjust related labor costs, fixed vs. vari able costs, targeted faculty to student ratios, increasing inflationary costs such as energy, and increasing salaries and benefits.

BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES FEBRUARY 18, 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 12 Page 1 SUBJECT First Reading - Occupancy Costs funding policy REFERENCE April 2008 JFAC Occupancy Costs Policy - Information Item APPLICABLE STATUTES, RULE OR POLICY Joint Finance Appropriations Committee' s \"Occupancy Costs Policy for Higher Education Facilities\" BACKGROUND / DISCUSSION Prior to adoption of this policy, o ccupancy costs were requested based on a formula in a spreadsheet maintained by the Board Office. On the funding side, JFAC had historically f unded occupancy costs on an ad hoc basis, often subject to the whims of the political process. In recognition of the arbitrary nature of the funding process, the FY 2008 appropriation for the Co llege & Universities included the following intent language: \"It is legislativ e intent that no further occupancy costs for postsecondary institut ions shall be funded by the Legislature until a written policy ha s been established which sets fo rth the eligibility criteria and formula by which occupancy costs are to be calculated.\" Pursuant to the intent language, on Dece mber 20, 2007, a JFAC subcommittee convened a work session with the instituti onal financial vice presidents, and reached agreement on a writt en policy related to requests for occupancy funding for general education spaces at higher educ ation institutions. The Policy was ratified by the full committee in the 2008 Session. IMPACT The Policy defines terms and documents the formula used to calculate occupancy costs. Under the Policy, the Office of the Stat e Board of Education (OSBE) is required to provide JFAC and the Governor wri tten notification of Board major project approval within 10 days of Board action in order for the project to be eligible for occupancy costs in the future. The Policy provides that if occupancy costs are requested but not funded due to budgetary reasons, institutions may r equest occupancy costs again in the following year. If, however, occupancy costs are denied for non-budgetary reasons, no further requests for occupancy co sts related to the space in question will be considered.

ATTACHMENT 1 Idaho State Board of Education GOVERNING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SECTION: V. FINANCIAL AFFAIRS Subsection: B. Budget Policies August February 2009 2010 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 12 Page 4 b. Approval by the Executiv e Director, or his or her des ignee, as authorized, for all increases and decreases of spending authority caused by changes in miscellaneous receipts is required. c. Miscellaneous receipts collected by an institution will not be allocated to another institution. The lump sum appropria tion will not be affe cted by changes in receipts. 3. Operating Budgets (Appropriated) a. Availability of Appropriated Funds i. Funds appropriated by t he legislature from the Stat e General Account for the operation of the institut ions, school and agencies (exclusive of funds for construction appropriated to the Permanent Building Fund) become available at the beginning of the fiscal year follo wing the session of the legislature during which the funds are appropriated, except when appropriation legislation contains an emergency clause. ii. These funds are generally allott ed periodically or are disbursed on submission of expenditure vouchers to the Office of the State Controller. b. Approval of Operating Budgets i. The appropriated funds operating budget s for the institutions, school and agencies under Board supervision are based on a fiscal year, beginning July 1 and ending on June 30 of the following year. ii. During the spring of each year, the chie f executive officer of each institution, school or agency prepares an operating bud get for the next fiscal year based upon guidelines adopted by t he Board.

The Office of the State Board of Education will coordinate the request for allotments and changes to allotments for the college and universities. 4. Operating Budgets (Non-appropria ted -- Auxiliary Enterprises) a. Auxiliary Enterprises Defined An auxiliary enterprise direct ly or indirectly provides a service to students, faculty, or staff and charges a fee related to but not necessarily equal to the cost of services. The distinguishing characteristic of most auxiliary enterprises is that they are managed essentially as self-suppor ting activities, whose services are provided primarily to individuals in the institutional community rather than to departments of the institution, although a portion of student fees or other support is sometimes allocated to them. Auxili ary enterprises should contribute and relate directly to the mission, goals, and objectives of the coll ege or university. Intercollegiate athletics and student health services should be included in the category of auxiliary enterprises if the activities are essentially self-supporting. All operating costs, including personnel, utilities, ma intenance, etc., for auxiliary enterprises are to be paid out of income from fees, charges, and sales of goods or services. No state appropr iated funds may be allocated to cover any portion of the operating costs. Ho wever, rental charges for uses of the facilities or services provided by auxiliary ent erprises may be assessed to departments or programs supported by state- appropriated funds. b. Operating Budgets i. Reports of revenues a nd expenditures must be subm itted to the State Board of Education at the request of the Board. ii. All proposed exp enditures from accumulated oper ating reserves in excess of $50,000 must be reported to the Board at the nex t scheduled meeting. 5. Operating Budgets (Non-appropriat ed -- Local Service Operations) a. Local Service Operations Defined Local service operations pr ovide a specific type of serv ice to various institutional entities and are supported by charges for such services to the user. Such a service might be purchased from commerc ial sources, but for reasons of convenience, cost, or control, is provided more effectively through a unit of the institution. Examples are mailing services, duplicating services, office machine maintenance, motor pools, and central stores.

A major renovation provides for a substantial change to a building. The change may include a remodeled wing or floor of a building, or the remodeling of the majori ty of the building's net assignable square feet. An extensive upgrade of one (1) or more of the major building systems is generally considered to be a major renovation. b. Preparation and Submission of Ma jor Capital Improvement Requests i.
