If they are real, how do they work? And how do you unblock your chakras? There's so much misinformation about chakras, even in many spiritual traditions. Because of its mystical nature, some believe in chakras while others think it's a myth. Forget everything you know or don't know about chakras. Read this article with an open mind and use your discernment to decide for yourself how you want to use this knowledge. Let's start with the definition of chakras and then talk about whether they are real or not. What Are Chakras? According to many spiritual teachings, chakras are energy centers in our bodies. When chakras are not balanced, our experiences are distorted and traumas are created. These traumas can turn into chronic anxiety, depression, or physical illness. When the chakras are aligned, energy flows easily and one evolves spiritually. Healing takes place and shows up in the body and mind. Are Chakras Real? Chakras or energy centers are located in your subtle body and therefore are metaphysical. You can't touch or see them, but you can sometimes feel them in your body. If you want direct experience of them, recall a time when you felt a sharp sensation in the base of your spine when you got scared suddenly or in your heart when you got emotionally hurt. These sensations are direct indications of contractions in the energy centers. Scientists and researchers are also catching up with the science of chakras ( [1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227917284_The_Physiological_Foundation_of_Yoga_Chakra_Expression), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1142191/)). Also, people like [Dr. Joe Dispenza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA6EYbaHRDM&vl=en) and [Neuroscientist Todd Murphy](https://www.god-helmet.com/wp/videos-on-spirituality-and-the-brain.htm) have contributed a lot to this topic. You can [read more about the science of spirituality from some of the books here](https://designepiclife.com/best-spiritual-books/). Moreover, these energy centers are also taught by Ra, which is an Extra-Terrestrial that described the [Law of One](https://www.lawofone.info/). It may be unbelievable for you if you're hearing this for the first time, but the more you go into it, the more you will be convinced of its legitimacy. So yes, in my experience and research, charkas are real. But you don't have to take my word for it. You can investigate on your own. And if you want to replace the word chakras with energy centers, that's fine too. How Many Chakras Are There? There are seven main chakras or energy centers in the body. How To Align / Heal / Balance / Open / Unblock Your Chakras Chakras can be too open or too blocked. Therefore, it's important to understand each chakra and learn how to balance it to avoid over-activation or blockage. Chakra healing and balancing is an ongoing process. As you learn to balance it, you get better at it but balancing never stops. Many people use crystals, yoga postures, essential oils, foods, etc. for healing chakras. These may work for real or placebo reasons, but I'll give you a much more direct and effective way to unblock each chakra. In my experience and knowledge, the best way to balance each chakra is through self-reflection and meditations. If you understand each chakra, you can reflect upon your life experiences and learn from them to balance each chakra. There are a lot of different explanations about chakras given in various spiritual traditions. The most reliable explanation of energy centers comes from Ra of the [Law of One](https://www.lawofone.info/), which I'm going to use as the basis for explaining each chakra and how to balance it. The first three energy centers or the lower chakras is where most of the energy gets stuck. If one learns to balance these chakras, the energy moves to the higher chakras for spiritual development and healing. Here is the explanation of all seven chakra symbols: Root Chakra (Muladhara) Color: Red Location: Base of the spine Function: Survival Blockage: Feeling fearful and unsafe Over-activation: Not being careful and considerate To balance: Understand, accept, resolve or surrender to your fears The first balancing is of the Malkuth, or Earth, vibratory energy complex, called the red-ray complex. An understanding and acceptance of this energy is fundamental.Ra, The Law of One Sacral Chakra (Svadhishthana) Color: Below Self-doubt and low self-esteem Over-activation: Attachment to personal identity To balance: Understand and accept yourself The next energy complex which may be blocked is the emotional or personal complex, also known as the orange-ray complex. This blockage will often demonstrate itself as personal eccentricities or distortions with regard to self-conscious understanding or acceptance of self.Ra, The Law of One Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura) Color: Location: Above the navel Function: Social relations Blockage: Insecurity/inferiority complex, avoiding social interaction, and being manipulated by others Over-activation: Superiority complex, power over others, and manipulation of others To balance: Understand and accept others and yourself in relation to others; no manipulation or power over others The third blockage resembles most closely that which you have called ego. It is the yellow-ray or solar plexus center. Blockages in this center will often manifest as distortions towards power, manipulation, and other social behaviors concerning those close and those associated with the mind/body/spirit complex.Ra, The Law of One Each entity must, in order to completely unblock yellow ray, love all which are in relationship to it, with hope only of the other-selves' joy, peace, and comfort.Ra, The Law of One Heart Chakra (Anahata) Color: Green Location: Middle of the chest Function: Universal/Unconditional love Blockage: Inability to express love, compassion, and understanding Over-activation: Martyr complex To balance: Understand, accept, forgive and love all without judgment or expectation of getting anything in return The center of heart, or green ray, is the center from which third-density beings may springboard, shall we say, towards infinite intelligence. Blockages in this area may manifest as difficulties in expressing what you may call universal love or compassion.Ra, The Law of One Fear of possession, desire for possession, fear of being possessed, desire to be possessed: these are the distortions which will cause the deactivation of green-ray energy transfer.Ra, The Law of One Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) Color: Blue Location: Base of the neck Function: Self-expression, free communication, honesty, and wisdom Blockage: Inability to accept/grasp communication from others and an inability/fear to express freely, openly, and honestly Over-activation: Communication/Expression without love or regard for another To balance: Communicate/Express freely and honestly to oneself and others The blue-ray center of energy streaming is the center which, for the first time, is outgoing as well as inpouring. Those blocked in this area may have difficulty in grasping the spirit/mind complexes of its own entity and further difficulty in expressing such understandings of self. Entities blocked in this area may have difficulties in accepting communication from other mind/body/spirit complexes.Ra, The Law of One Third Eye Chakra (Ajna) Color: Indigo Location: Between the unity consciousness; universal/sacred energies, insights; faith and will Blockage: Lessening of the influx of intelligent energy (or connection with your higher self) due to feelings of unworthiness Over-activation: Attachment or identification with higher self To balance: See yourself infinitely worthy and one with the universe The next center is the pineal or indigo-ray center. Those blocked in this center may experience a lessening of the influx of intelligent energy due to manifestations which appear as unworthiness. This is that of which you spoke. As you can see, this is but one of many distortions due to the several points of energy influx into the mind/body/spirit complex. The indigo-ray balancing is quite central to the type of work which revolves about the spirit complex, which has its influx then into the transformation or transmutation of third density to fourth density, it being the energy center receiving the least-distorted outpourings of love/light from intelligent energy and having also the potential for the key to the gateway of intelligent infinity.Ra, The Law of One The indigo ray is opened only through considerable discipline and practice largely having to do with acceptance of self, not only as the polarized and balanced self but as the Creator, as an entity of infinite worth. This will begin to activate the indigo ray.Ra, The Law of One Crown Chakra (Sahasrara) Color: Violet Location: Top of the head Function: Realization of one's sacramental nature, connection with the divine/creator as self This is the sum total of the balance of other energy centers. Balancing and unblocking of other energy centers leads to activation of this energy center. The remaining center of energy influx is simply the total expression of the entity's vibratory complex of mind, body, and spirit. It is as it will be, \"balanced\" or \"imbalanced\" has no meaning at this energy level, for it gives and takes in its own balance. Whatever the distortion may be, it cannot be manipulated as can the others and, therefore, has no particular importance in viewing the balancing of an entity.Ra, The Law of One The energy ingress ends with indigo. The violet ray is a thermometer or indicator of the whole.Ra, The Law of One How Do You Know If Your Chakras Are Blocked? Each experience goes through the energy centers from bottom to top. When the chakras are not balanced, there is a contraction in an energy center and one is not able to discern the right view of a situation. Hence, he/she develops distortions that lead to suffering, trauma, and illness. Each chakra has its own symptom of blockage or over-activation as explained above. For example, if you're feeling unsafe or fearful, it indicates a blockage in the root chakra. If you're feeling inferior or superior, it indicates an imbalance in the solar plexus chakra, and so on. Your task is to consistently purify each energy center by becoming aware of the blockage or over-activation from your experiences. Once you're aware, the work is to heal yourself and change your thought patterns so that the [subconscious mind](https://designepiclife.com/internal-monologue/) changes too. When the chakras are balanced, energy can move up to the higher chakras as your distortions resolve and your consciousness rises. Your experiences will be less distorted in the lower energy centers which are about survival, personal identity and social relations. Instead, you will be able to purify your experiences to dwell more in higher energy centers which are about love, wisdom, service, clairvoyance, unity, and oneness. The more balanced your energy centers become, the fewer emotional triggers you'll feel. More and more, you'll feel loving, free, peaceful, grateful, joyous, and you'll gain more wisdom as you get insights from your higher self. You will radiate healing, inspiration, and faith onto others. Ready For A Radical Transformation, Healing And Awakening?
