Introduction What is in formed consent to health care, and why has it assu med such an im portant place in legal and et hical discussions ? Is it merely a rhetorical construct, imposed halfheartedly upon medicine by the law? Or is it perhaps a t oken of larger changes in the relationship between patients and health care professiona ls, espe cially physicia ns? And wh y does the concept have such importance i n the United States today \u2014 because of a particula r cultural attachment to inde pende nce a nd autonomy? The growing importance of biomedicine in people's lives? Skepticism over \"exp ertise\" in many spheres? Or perh aps so me combination of these a nd other fact ors? These were among the basic issues before the President's Commission duri ng its Congressionally mandated study of \"t he et hical and leg al implicatio ns of t he req uirements for inform ed consent to... undergo medical proced ures.\"1Rather tha n embroide r the doctri ne o f informed consent with in the confines of the case and statutory law tha t was its sou rce, th e Commissi on decided early in its stud y to examine the subject within the broa der cont ext of rel ations an d co mmunications between patients and heal th care pr ofessionals. It wishe d to see whethe r means coul d be found to promote a ful ler understanding by patients and professionals of their comm on enterprise , so th at patients can particip ate, on an informed basis and to 1 42 D.S.C. \u00a7 30 0v-1(a)(1)(A) (1981) also instructs the Commissi on to stud y the implications of \"informed consent to pa rticipation in res earch projec ts.\" Th e Commission treats issues of hu man resear ch generally in its b iennial reports, PROTECTING HUMAN SUBJECTS. Further more, although they develope d initially along in dependen t lines, see note 19 , Chapter One infra, the leg al rules for inform ed co nsent to t reatment and to par ticipation in rese arch spring fro m common legal and philosophical ground, have had parallel cours es of development, an d are now basically congr uent, so that a sep arate discussion is not requ ired in this Report. 2 Making Health Care Decisions Summ ary of Conclusion s and Recom mendations Before the Commission could consider means of improvement, it had to address the underlying theoretical issues. The ethical foundation of inform ed cons ent ca n be traced to t he prom otion of two values: personal well-being and sel f-determination. To e nsure that these values are res pected and e nhance d, the Commission fi nds that patients who have the cap acity to make decisio ns abou t their care m ust be permitted to do so voluntarily and m ust have al l relevant information re garding their cond ition and altern ative treat ments, benefits, risks, c osts, c onseque nces, an d si gnificant unce rtainties surrounding any of t his information. T his concl usion has seve ral specific im plications: (1) Although th e info rmed consent doctrin e has sub stantial foundations in law, it is essen tially an ethical imperative. (2) Ethically valid conse nt is a proce ss of share d decisionmaking based upon mutual resp ect an d particip ation , not a ritu al to be equated with recitin g the con tents of a fo rm that details the risk s of particular treatm ents. (3) Much of the sch olarly literature an d legal com mentary about informed consen t portrays it as a h ighly rat ional means of decisionm aking about health care m atters, thereby sug gestin g that it may o nly be suitable for and app licab le to well-ed ucated, articu late, self-aware indiv iduals. Whether this is wh at th e leg al doctrine was intended to be o r what it h as inadvertently b ecome, it is a view th e Commissio n unequivocally rej ects. Although su bcultures with in American soci ety differ i n their views about autonomy and i ndividual choice and abo ut the etiology of illn ess and the roles of healers and patients,2 a survey conducted for the Commission fo und a u niversal desire for information, ch oice, and res pectful com munication abo ut decisions.3 Inform ed consent must rem ain flexible, yet the process , as the Commission en visions it throughout this Report, is ethically requi red of health care practitio ners in their relatio nships with all patien ts, no t a luxury for a few. (4) In form ed consent is rooted in the fundamental reco gnition\u2014 reflected in t he legal pres umption of competency \u2014that adults are entitled to, accep t or reject h ealth care i nterven tions on the basis of their own personal values and in furtherance o f 2 Robert A. Hahn, Culture and Informed Consent: An Anthropological Perspective (1982), Appendix F, in Volu me Th ree of this R eport. 3 The Commissi on's survey of the public broke down these responses on the basis of va riables such as age, gender, race, education, and incom e. the extent they care to do s o, in making decis ions about thei r health ca re. Introduction 3 their ow ersonal goals. Nonetheless, patient choice is not absolute. n p. Patien ts are not en titled to insist th at health care practitio ners furnis h them services when t o do so would violate either the bounds of acc eptable practice or a professi onal's own deeply eld moral beliefs or would draw on a limited reso urce on hich the patient has no binding claim. h w. The fundamental values that informed consent is in tended to promote\u2014sel f-determination and patient wel l-being\u2014both demand that alternative arrangem ents for health care decisionmaking be m ade for individuals who lack su bstantial capacity to make their own decisi ons. Respect for self- determination requires, however, th at in the first in stance individuals be deem ed to have deci sional capaci ty, wh ich shoul d not be treated as a hurdle to be surmounted in the vast ajority o f cases, and that incapacity be treated as a isqualifying factor in the small minority of cases. m d. Decisionm aking capacity is sp ecific to each partic ular decision. Although som e peopl e lack this capacity for all decisions, m any are incapacitate d in more lim ited way s and are capa ble of making som e deci sions but not others. T he conce pt of capaci ty is best un derst ood and a pplied in a functional manner. That is, the presence or a bsence of capaci ty does not depe nd on a person's status or on the ecision reac hed, but on that individual's actual functioning in tuations i n which a deci sion about health care is to be made. d si. Decision makingincapacity sh ould be found to exist on ly when people lack the ability to make decisio ns that pro mote eir well-th being in conformit y with their own previously pressed values and pre ferences. ex. To the extent feasib le people with no decision making capacity should still b e consulted abou t their o wn preferen ces out of respect for them as individua ls. (5) Heal th care providers s hould not ordinarily withhold unpleasant inform ation sim ply because it is unpl easant. The ethical foundations of informed consent allo w th e with holding of inform ation from patients only when they request that it be wi thheld or when it disclosure pe r se would cause substantial d etrimen t to their well-bei ng. Furtherm ore, t he Commission fou nd that most members of t he public do n ot wish to have \"bad news\" withheld from them. (6) Achieving the Commission's vi sion of shared deci sionmaking based on mutual resp ect is ultimately the resp onsibility of ind ividual health care pro fessionals. Ho wever, health care i nstitutions such as hospitals and professional schools have 4 Making Health Care Decisions important roles to play in assistin g health care p rofessio nals in this obligation . The manner in which health care is p rovided in institutional settin gs often resu lts in a fragmentation of respon sibility th at may neglect the human side of health care. T o assist in guarding agai nst this, institutional health care prov iders sh ould ensu re th at ultimately th ere is one readily id entifiab le p ractitio ner respo nsible fo r providing inform ation to a particular pat ient. Although pieces of inform ation m ay be pr ovided by various people, there sh ould be one i ndividual officially charge d with responsi bility for e nsuring that all the necessary inform ation is comm unicated and that the patient's wishe s are known t o the treatm ent tea m. (7) Patients shoul d ha ve access to the inform ation they need to help them understand their co nditions and make treatm ent decisio ns. To this end t he Commission rec ommends t hat heal th care pr ofessionals and institutions not o nly prov ide information but also assist patients who request add itional inform ation to ob tain it fro m relev ant sources, including hospital an d public libraries. (8) As cases arise and new legisla tion is contemplated, co urts and legislatu res sh ould reflect th is view of ethically v alid consent. Nevertheless, th e Co mmissi on does not look to legal reform s as th e primary means of bringing about changes i n the relationship between health ca re professionals a nd patients. (9) The C ommission fin ds that a num ber o f relativel y sim ple changes in practice co uld facilitate p atient particip ation in health care decisionmaking. Se veral specific techni ques\u2014suc h as having patients express, orally o r in writin g, th eir understand ing of the treatm ent consente d to\u2014dese rve further study. Furtherm ore, addi tional societal resources nee d to be com mitted t o improving the human side of health care, w hich has appa rently deteriorated at the sam e time there ha ve bee n substan tial g ains in health care tech nology. The Dep artmen t of Health and Human Serv ices, and especially the Natio nal Institutes o f Health , is an app ropriate ag ency for th e developmen t of initiativ es and the evaluation of their e fficacy in this area . (10) Beca use health care professionals a re responsi ble for ensuring that patients can particip ate effectiv ely in d ecision making regarding their care, edu cators have a resp onsibility to prep are physician s and nurses t o carry out this obligation. T he Commission therefore c oncludes that: . Curricular innovations ai med at prepa ring health professionals for a pr ocess o f mutual deci sionmaking with patients sho uld be continued and streng thened, with carefu l atten tion being paid to the development of methods for evaluating the effectiveness of such innovations. Introduction 5 . Exam inations and evaluations at the professional school d national levels sh ould reflect th e importance of these sues. an is. Seriou s atten tion shou ld be p aid to preparing health professionals for team pract ice in order to enhance patient particip ation and well-b eing. (11) Fam ily members are oft en of great as sistance to pat ients in helping to understand information about their condition and in making decisions a bout treatm ent. The Co mmission rec ommends that heal th care in stitutions and professio nals reco gnize th is and ju diciously attempt to involve family members in decisionmaking for patients, with due regard for th e priv acy of patients and for th e possib ilities fo r coerci on that s uch a practice may entail. (12) The Commission recognizes t hat its vision of health care decisionmaking m ay involve greater commitments of time on the part of health professi onals. Because of the importanc e of sha red decisionmaking ba sed on mutual trust, not only for the promotion o f patient wel l-being a nd sel f-determination but also for the therapeutic gains t hat can be realized, the Commission recommends that all medical and surgical in terventions be thought of as i ncluding appropriate discussi on with patients. Reimbursem ent to t he professional should therefore take account of time spe nt in disc ussion rather than regarding it as a sep arate item for which additional paymen t is m ade. (13) To protect the interests of patients who lack decisionmaking capacity a to ensure th eir well-b eing sions made by others on patients' behalf should, when possible, attempt to replicate the ones patients would make if they were cap able of do ing so. When th is is not feasi ble, decisions by surrogates on behalf of patients must prot ect the patients ' best interests. B ecause s uch decisions a re not instances of pe rsonal self-c hoice, limits may be placed on the range of acceptable de cisions that s urrogates m ake beyond those t hat apply whe n a pe rson makes hi s or her wn deci sions. o. Health care i nstitutions should ado pt clear and exp licit policies regarding how an d by whom deci sions a re to be ade for patients who cannot deci de. m. Families, h ealth care in stitutions, and professio nals should work tog ether to make health care decision s for p atients who lack decisionmaking c apacity.

As a m eans o f prese rving some self-det ermination for patients who no longer possess decisionmaking ca pacity, state court s and l egislatures should consider making provision for advance directives through which pe ople desi gnate others t o make health care decisions on their behalf and/or give instructions about thei r care. The C ommission ac knowledges that the conclusions c ontained i n this Rep ort will n ot be simp le to ach ieve. Even when patients and practitio ners alik e are sen sitive to the goal of shared d ecisio nmaking based on mutual resp ect, substan tial b arriers will st ill exist.4 Som e of these ob stacles, su ch as lo ngstand ing p rofession al attitu des or difficu lties in conveying medical in formation in ordinary language, are form idable but can be overcome if th ere is a will to do so. Oth ers, su ch as the depe ndent condition of very sick patients or t he ever-growing complexity a nd sub specializatio n of med icine, will h ave to be accomm odated beca use they proba bly cannot be elim inated. Nonetheless, t he, Co mmissi on's vision of in form ed consent still h as value as a m easuri ng st ick against which actual performance m ay be judged a nd as a goal toward which all particip ants in health care decisionmaking ca n strive.

In add ition, the Commiss ion convened a panel of nursing experts from all over the country to discuss t hese issues.5 The C ommission also c ontracted fo r three em pirical studies i n order to clari fy certain aspe cts of inform ed con sent in practice.6 The results of these stud ies are used throughout the Rep ort to illustrate k ey points and to measure t he extent of discrepancy between current pract ice and t he goals for communication and deci sionmaking articulated by the Commis sion. Although health care is clearly a d iverse en terprise, the leg al doctrine of informed con sent seem s to operate on th e implicit assum ption t hat medical care i s onl y conce rned with invasive procedures (ty pically surge ry). To redress the na rrowness of this focus, the first commissioned st udy sought to determine wh ether a nd how decisionmaking an d communication between pat ients and heal th care professionals varied in different health care settings according to the nature of th e illness an d treat ments under consideration , the typ es of health care provide rs, and patient characteristics. The study was conducted thro ugh interviews and observation under the direction of Profess ors Charles W. Lidz and Ala n Meisel of the Uni versity of Pittsb urgh and o f the Western Psych iatric In stitute and Clin ic. Two researc hers observe d a s urgical outpa tient clin ic an d card iology and surgery ward s in a un iversity h ospital o ver a p eriod of several weeks, throughout the day and e vening. Afte r noting the routines i n each setting for seve ral days, information was gat hered on almost 200 c ases. In 124 of these, the e ncounters between pa tients, ph ysician s, and nu rses were observed a nd recorded, and semistructured interviews w ere con ducted with all who were invo lved in the decisio n at h and, often including family members. Much has been written about the potentially negative consequences of providing patien ts with full in formation about their con ditions and treatm ent, espe cially edically necessa ry\" treatm ent, yet only scattered anecdotal of s uch refusals e xists.

The focus of most of these studi es has been on physicians, with ver y little attention p aid to nurses an d other h ealth p rofessionals who inter act with patients. Where information about the roles of nonph ysician p rofessionals is available it has been includ ed. 8 Making Health Care Decisions other observational study sought to determine the frequency , nature. causes, a nd effects of treatm ent refusa ls. It fo und that treatmen t refu sals were usually trigg ered by too little informatio n rath er than too much. The study was conducted in three sta ges by Drs . Paul S. Appel baum and Loren H. Ro th of the Western Psych iatric In stitute an d Clin ic in Pittsb urgh. In the first stage, se ven wards in four different medical hospitals were studied: a m edicine, a s urgery, and a neurologyward in a university-affiliated teaching hospital; a gynec ology ward in a university-affiliated women's hospital; an o pthalmology ward in a university-affiliated specialty h ospital; an d a medical an d a surg ical ward in a larg e community hospital. Each ward was visited for m ost of a day four tim es at one -week interval s, with each visit being held on a different day of the week. Information was provided by the nurse on all treatment refusals in the prev ious 24 hours; charts were revie wed and interviews cond ucted with the nurse most familiar with th e case, with the staff m ember who elicited th e refusal, and with the patient. In the second stage, m ore in -depth study was m ade of t he longitudinal course of refusals on the medical and s urgical wa rds of the university-affiliated teaching hospital. Daily rounds we re made for a three-week period of the surgery ward and for an eight-week pe riod on the medicine war d. One observer made rou nds with house st aff a nd conducted interviews with ph ysician s and nu rses while th e other observer interviewed patients. In the third stage, a case st udy approach was use d to follow a num ber of cases of t reatm ent refusa l through the end of t he patients' hospitalizatio n. Medical charts we re reviewe d daily, extensive initial in terviews were conducted with patients and they were re-inte rviewed at least every other day, and i n most cases a fam ily member was i nterviewed as well. In the third em pirical study done f or the Commission, L ouis Harri s and Asso ciates con ducted parallel n ational surveysof physician s and th e public reg arding their attitu des toward , experien ce with, and knowledg e of informed conse nt, disclosure of inform ation, and decisi onal authority in medical care. The quest ionnaires we re designed by Commission st aff in conj unction with John M. Boyle an d Paul J. Br ounstein o f the Harris organizatio n. Telep hone interviews were co nducted with represen tative national sam ples of 800 physicians and 1250 adults in the general public. According to t he acce pted prin ciples for suc h polls, the sam ple sizes were sufficien tly larg e to allo w general state ments to be made about the populatio ns from which they we re drawn with 95% confi dence that esti mates were co rrect to within 3%, and to permit an alysis b y subgroups with reasonable confidence. For the Introduction 9 public an \"area p robability sa mple\" b ased on rando m-digit d ialing was used,7 and for the physician survey a random sam ple was drawn of doctors who spend the majority of their time in di rect care of adul t patients.8 The response rate to both surveys was a pproximately 70%, whic h is well within (or above) the range of statistical acceptability fo r such surveys. In analyzing the dat a from the sur veys, many cross -tabulations we re perform ed to see wh ether there were variatio ns in attitu des or behavior by subgroups of the public or the physician s. For the public surv ey all questions concerni ng disclosure of information, decisionmaking, and knowledg e of in form ed consent were ex amined in relatio n to the respondents' age, gender, race, fam ily income, educat ion, sel f-reported health status, a nd health insurance st atus, w hether or not the person had ever had a life-th reaten ing illness, and the locale wh ere he or she usually receive d medical care. For t he physici an sample all data were exam ined in relation to specialty, year of graduation from medical scho ol, type of medical scho ol attended (public, private, or foreign, and extent of researc h involvement), no rmal location of pract ice (o ffice or h ospital), the proportion of patients under the physician'scare who were se riously ill, th e proportio n who were poor, and the proportio n who the physician thought could understand most aspect s of their condition and treatment. It is important to note that differe nt empirical methods y ield dat a that can differ in se veral ways. Su rveys are base d on self-reports about past or hypothetical situations and therefore may not be entirely accurate reflections of pract ice. Regarding health c are, s urveys a re known t o overstate th e frequ ency with wh ich informatio n is d isclosed and may present a rosi er, more hom ogeneo us picture of m edical practice than an on-site invest igation of the same population would. On the other hand, although studies by qual ified neut ral observers pr ovide a truer picture of a piece of the real worl d, they often do not perm it broa d concl usions t o be dra wn. The resul ts of 7 The pub lic sample was stratif ied b y region o f the countr y and within each region b y size of the commun ity. Use of random-digit dialin g ensures tha t unlisted telepho nes are survey ed. Telephon e surveys may slightly overr epresen t the antly overrepresent fem ales. To avoid this latter imbalance in th e sample, a quota techn ique was used. In addition, all responses were weighted befo re doing the analy ses to ensu re th at results reflected the total population r ather than the popu lation with telep hones, th ereby eliminating th e slight bi as tha t arises from the fact that abou t 2% of the U.S. population do no t hav e telephones. 8 The ph ysician sample was dr awn ac cording to stud y spe cifications by the American Medi cal Associ ation , which m aintains files of all physicians in the countr y and upd ates th em mont hly. This is the m ost reli able source of d ata on the total ph ysician population in the countr y. 10 Making Health Care Decisions surveys are quantifia ble, whereas observational studies largely yield qualitativ e results. Th e findings from these two typ es of studies are often complementary but they may also be divergent in som e respec ts. (Differe nces between t he Commission' s survey an d the ob servation al studies are noted throughout the Report where relevant.) In general , the Commission's sur veys found that the relationship between physician s and patien ts is d ynamic, th at d isclosures are extensive, t hat unde rstanding an d sat isfaction ar e hi gh, that decisionmaking is shared\u2014and that patients expect their relations with physicians to have these characteristic s. Thi s was found t o be es pecially true for office-b ased (as d istinct fro m clinic- or hospital-based) setting s, where doctors and patients are app arently ab le to estab lish a relation ship over time. Fur therm ore, as might be e xpected, t he public's experience with the health care system appea rs to vary depen ding on whether the patient is young or ol d, in good or poor health, and well or po orly educated . In contrast, ph ysician s' self-rep orted behaviors and attitu des were relatively hom ogeneous. E ven though the issue of i nformed consent has received a great deal of attention in the last deca de, there was little variation am ong physicians by specialty, age, or nat ure of patients under their care. The o bservational studies, on the other hand, found e normous variation in the patient-professional relationship and the decisionmaking process wi thin various h ospital settings. Such va riation appea rs to be related to the stru cture in which care is d elivered and th e nature of patien ts' co nditions and treat ments. In these stu dies, it was rare fo r the process described in t his Report as i deal to be realized in practice. Because the observational studies were conducted principally in university-affiliated teaching hospitals the findings may not be represe ntative of all hospital care. For exam ple, in non-teaching hospitals patients are more likely to be c ared for by fewer doctors (perhaps only one) than in teach ing hospitals staffed with a larg e number of interns and resid ents, thus lessen ing the p ossibility t hat on e doctor will mistakenly assu me that an other doctor has talk ed with a p atient about treatm ent. The Report In add ition to hearing witn esses, th e Co mmissio n devoted po rtion s of a n umber of m eetings t o its own del iberat ions o n the study and helpful comments were rece ived from former Commissione r Renee C . Fox, Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, and Professor Jay Katz of Yale Law Sc hool. Drafts o f this Repo rt were discuss ed at several Commission m eetings. On M ay 14, 1982, a d raft was reviewed an d the central conclusions were approved. On August 12, Introduction 11 1982, a fi nal draft was di scussed an d ap proved, subject to editorial corrections, by the Commissione rs wh o had revi ewed the earlier dra ft and by four newly appointed m embers. The C ommission has divided this Report into four parts. The fi rst traces the history of i nform ed conse nt in the law a nd in m edical practice and briefly sketches rece nt changes in the nature of health care and in society's expe ctations for the patient- professio nal relation ship. This is followed by a discussi on of the val ues underlying informed co nsent. In Part T wo, the ethical and legal oblig ations of health care pr ofessionals are di scussed agai nst a bac kdrop of what is known about actual pract ice. Part Three exp lores sev eral means to bring goals and realities clo ser together. Atten tion is directed to innovative app roaches in patient- professional communication an d decisionmaking that appea r to be practically as well as th eoretically soun d. Le gal rules, al ong with profession al attitu des and behavior as they are sh aped by education and training, are exa mined for th e roles th ey cou ld play in prov iding patients in decisio nmaking. Reco gnizing that som e people are una ble to m ake some or all d ecisions o n their own behalf, the Commission in Part Four of the Report sets forth principles and procedures for heal th care deci sions that others must make for patients who lack deci sionmaking capacity. Values I Informed Consent as Active, Shared Decisionmaking The complexities o f modern life make it difficu lt for in dividuals to be masters of their own fate. Perhaps i n no sphere of everyday activ ity is this more acu te than in health care. Th is often frustrating lack of con trol can be trace d to several recent devel opments: the inc reasing reliance on adva nced technology, the high degree of specialization, t he consequent segm entation of care among an imposing a rray of heal th care profession als who are often strang ers to the p atient. But these latter-d ay devel opments have only magnified the sen se of a we people have al ways felt wh en confronted with the mysterie s of life, illn ess, an d death that are health ca re's most basic conce rns. Trad itionally, many cultures, in cluding this one, have respo nded by according heal ers a uni que defere nce an d authority in their relations hips with patients.l Yet th is authori- 1 1 Historic ally, the law of inform ed consen t develo ped in the context of claims by patients aga inst physicians. Th e ratio nale of existing law would, however , support the application of inf ormed consent requirements to nonph ysician practitioners who function as independen t provid ers of heal th ca re. As nurses an d other nonph ysician health professionals move into such roles, these leg al requirements will become in cumbent upon them as well. The law has thus f ar had lit tle o ccasion to addr ess in an y det ail the distinc tive legal oblig ations regarding infor med consent, if any, of nurses and other nonph ysician h ealth care professionals in their myriad o ther prof essional r oles and functio ns. Insofar as this Report addresse s the di stinctiv ely ethical as we ll as lega l requirements of informed consen t, the Com mission wis hes to m ake cl ear that its discussion is dir ected to all health car e professio nals, in cluding those who wor k as members of health care teams rather 16 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 1 ty is n ot, and has not been, absolute. Ancient writin gs indicate li mits on the authority of th e physician.2 Within the Anglo-Am erican tradition, the law h as for cen turies recogn ized the obligation of ph ysician s to seek the consent of th eir p atients prior to initiatin g treat ment,3And in the pas t quarter-century, A merican cou rts, suppo rted by legal an d eth ical commentary, have articulate d a legal doctrine of \"i nformed con sent\" that requires h ealth care practitio ners no t sim ply to seek the consent of their patien ts, but also, through a process of disclosure an d discussion between practitio ners an d patients, to make such formed.\"4 Thus , the law requ iring in formed con sent has become an important means by which society regulates rel ationships between pat ients and health care profe ssionals. To w hat degree does t his legal requirement of i nformed co nsent advance the abilit y of patients to maintain control of and be respon sible for decisions regarding their lives a nd their health? How closely does t he practice of inform ed conse nt in day- to-day health care accord with the theory? Can public policy prom ote a sy stem in which patients can cope more su ccessfu lly with the complexities o f modern medicine? And quite apart from legal requirements, how ca n heal th care providers be encourag ed to recogn ize an d to satisfy th eir distinctive moral obligations to their patients? Current requirements fo r informed conse nt owe m uch to the lega l system, but the values underlying these requirements than prim arily as independ ent p ractitioners. W hile they may not curren tly have the sam e lega l duties as indep endent prac titioners, obligat ions to r espect and serv e the in terests of their pa tients. In this Report, therefor e, such individua ls are encom passed within the m eaning of the term s \"professionals\", \"providers,\" and \"pr actitioners,\" which a re used here interchange ably except wher e specific ally m odified . Some of the inform ed consent s tatutes specifically indicate the types of health care pro viders to whom they apply , such as ph ysician' s assistants, nur ses, podiatrists, etc. See Alan Meisel and Lisa D.

Rather, t hey are dee ply embedde d in American culture a nd the American ch aracter; th ey transcend partisan ideologies an d the po litics o f the moment. Fundamentally, in formed consent is base d on res pect for the in dividual, an d, in particular, for each individual's capaci ty and ri ght both to define his or he r own goals and t o make choices designe d to ac hieve t hose goals.5 But in defining informed consent (an d its exceptions) the law h as tempered this rig ht of self- determination wi th respect for other val ues, such as promotion of wel l- being in the context of an expert-layperson relationshi p.6 The values underlying informed consent are widely shared by people in all segm ents of Am erican s ociety. Regardless of race, inc ome, educat ion, age, or gender, the vast majority of people surveyed by the Commission felt that patients have a right to information and ought to participate in decisions re garding their health care.

Furtherm ore, 4% mentioned consent forms, 3% sai d it was a legal doctrine, and 3% said it was mean ingless. In this Repo rt, the Co mmissio n focuses primarily o n the ethical an d practical dimensions of informed co nsent, and in particular on the source and extent of p rofessional obligation s of health care practitio ners to respect an d enhance their patien ts' cap acities for wise ex ercise o f their autonomy. The fo cus is no t particularly on the law, and the Repor t recom mends f ew changes i n existing legal or regulatory norms. Ye t because informed conse nt arose as a distinctively legal doct rine, an d because m any misundersta ndings a nd m isappre hensions concerning informed consent derive from th e doctrine's orig ins in the law, it is useful to begin by tracing the legal evol ution of informed conse nt requirem ents. 18 Makin g Health Care Decisions: Chapter 1 Legal Background Devel opment of the Law.The prec ursors of the modern doct rine of informed consent are found in the venerable English com mon law regarding batte ry, which forbade harm ful Shared Deci sionmaking 19 or offensi ve nonconsensual touchi ng, however benign in motive or physical effect .8 No s pecial exce ptions were m ade for m edical care, except i n emergency situations.9 Thus, under the comm on law, a m edical intervention in wh ich the practitio ner tou ched the body of the patient would con stitute a tech nical battery un less the patient consented to th e intervention.10 The nature of th e con sent requ ired to avoid liability for battery was not especially ex actin g. It cou ld be given explicitly in word s, manifested by actions , or, in som e instances , implied from the circum stances.11 The law was not overly co ncerned with the qu ality o f the patient's understanding of what was being consented to, nor did it impose a ny strenu ous obligations on the ph ysician to disclose wh at was i nvolved, beyond perhaps the nam e or cu rsory description of the procedure.12 Although the law im posed no affirm ative obligation to go beyond th at simple d isclosure, th e practitio ner was ex pected to refrai n from fraudulent or deceptive statements, because they coul d invalidate the patient's con sent and subject th e physician to po tential liab ility.13 Few of t he early cases concerning nonc onsensual medical proce dures (including Am erican case s the first deca des of this ce ntury ) gave much explicit at tention to disclosure by the physician .14 Rath er, th ey focused on unauthorized procedures,15 8 William L.

States have also di ffered in whether the a pplicable \"standard o f care\" re garding what must be disclosed is base d on professional custom (which typically requi res that the pat ient produce ex pert testimony on such a stan dard) or on some notion of th e \"m ateriality\" o f the information to be disclosed (wh ich allows a case to go to the jury without the patient needing to prove professional custom through expert testimony, a st anda rd decidedly more favorable to the injured patient in most circum stances.)25 Some of the cases suggest that a legal hybrid has been create d, drawing on the law of battery, of negligence, and of fiduciary obligatio ns.26 23 In man y states, abo lition of batter y as the appropriate caus e of action for inform ed cons ent act ions has been ach ieved judici ally.

When the three significant cases were de cided in 1972, the in termediate app ellate courts of thr ee states had adopted the patien t-based appro ach, though no state supreme courts had. See Hunter v. Brown, 4 Wash. App. 899 , 484 P.2d 1162, aff'd, 81 Wash. 2d 465, 502 P.2d 1194 (1972); Ma son v. Ellsworth, 3 Wash. App. 298, 474 P.2d 909 (1970); Cooper v. R oberts, 220 Pa.

Id. at 10 24-28. However, beginning in the mid-1970s, a number of states enacted s tatutes changing the s tandard b ackto a professional one. Thus as of this writing, 26 states have adop ted a profe ssional standard, 9 stat es have a patient- orient ed standard, and 3 states have no law on the subject. 31 Between 197 5 and 1977, abo ut half the states enacted leg islation relating to requirements for informed consent.

Rath er, co urts are supp to decide concrete cases, brought by individuals seeki ng redress for thei r injuries or enforcem ent of t heir ri ghts. In the context of i nformed con sent, such cases t ypically involve alleg ations by an injured patien t that a practitio ner's im proper failure to warn of specific risks led the patie nt to accept medical proce dures tha t resul ted in harm the pat ient would have avoided if warned. The courts must determine wh ether such alleg ations are true and, if s o, whet her the practitio ner sho uld be legally liab le to the injured patient. On ly by understand ing this process and the practical d ifficu lties in carrying it out can the dev elopment of the leg al doctrine of in form ed con sent be appreciated. Sha red Deci sionmaking 25 First, the m edical malpractice cas es that find t heir way to cour t invariably involve medical interve ntions that did not go wel1.33 Not only has the patient been physically injured by the interventio n, but the patien t is suffi ciently d ispleased by the outcome so as to in itiate leg al actio n, with its well-kno wn costs an d tribulations, which may include the destruction of any positive relatio nship between p atient and professi onal. When there a stro ng pr eexisting bond between p atient and profession al, an d when the patien t was p repared for the possibility o f an adverse ou tcome, litig ation is less lik ely.34Thus, the courts' perspective is necessarily sha ped by the ir near -exclusive ex perience with injured, unhappy patients. The far more num erous instances i n which care is provided without serious misadventure do not com ebefore them. Thi s may help explain the som etimes differing perspectives of judges, who see onl y the bad outcomes, and health care professi onals, who see the good as well as the bad. Second, and m ore specific to info rmed cons ent, c ourts see only those cases i n which particular al legedly undisclosed risks ass ociated with medical proce dures have led to actual injuries.35This fact, altho ugh perhaps obvious in itself, has 33 This is an almost inevit able cons equen ce of treating actions for la ck o f inform ed cons ent as a species of neglig ence r ather than as battery, see note 26 supra, since n egligen ce actions t radition ally requ ire ph ysical harm to person o r property and do not permit an award of damages for dignitar y affronts alone. Prosse r, supra note 8 , \u00a7 30 at 14 3. See a lso note 35 infra. 34 \"[If] patient- physician rappo rt is high , [the patient] is less l ikely to sue his doctor in the first instan ce.\" R. Crawford Morris and Alan R. Moritz , DOCTO R AND PATIENT AND THE LA W (5th ed. 1971 ), quoted in Wilkinson v. Vesey , 110 R.I . 606, 295 A.2d 676 , 690 (1972). 35 This is referred to as the \" materialized risk\" r equirement, which holds that a patient suffers n o legally remediable wrong un less there has b een some bodily injur y. See, e.g ., Canterbur y v. ; Cornfeldt 262 N.W.2d 684, 699 (Minn. 1977) . This requirement has received sever e criticism for failing to \"recognize that a citizen can be wronge d without being h armed, that his dignity as a hu man being has b een vio lated an d that an as sault has taken pla ce the moment the [doctor] com mences therap y..., even if b eneficial.... \" tein, supra note 23, at 691. O ccasi onall y, patients have r ecovered in lawsuits merely for the dignitar y affr ont involv ed in nonconsensual treatment. See, e.g., Lloyd v. Kull, 329 F.2d 168 (7th Cir. 1964) ($500 for unauthorized r emoval of a mole); Ro later v . Strain, 39 Okla. 572 P. 96 (1913) ($1000 for unau thorized remova l of a foot bone) ; Mohr v. Williams, 95 Minn. 261 , 104 N.W. 12 (190 5); cf. Bailey v. Belinf ante, 218 S.E.2d 289 (Ga. App. 1975) (plaintif f sought damages but did not recover for alleged ly nonconsensual tr eatment b y dentist), but none of these cases involved allegations of inadequ ate disclosure, m erely the fai lure to o btain consen t. In the absenc e of bad res ults, a p atient m ay onl y be aw arded nominal damages for injur y to dignity . See, e. g., McC andless v. State, 3 A , 149 26 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 1 important consequ ences for th e nature of in form ed consent litig ation. Most sig nifican tly, in such cases atten tion ten ds to fo cus almost automatically on the particular procedure e mployed and on the risk that resulted in injury. The inq uiry con cerns whether that particular risk was disclosed, rat her than whether t he overall course of care, and the extended process of disclosure, discussion, and decisionmaking regarding care, were properly res pectful of the patient's right of self-determination. Thus, the very nature of the court's task explains t he law's oft-rem arked preoccupation with the risks of particular proced ures,36 often to the exclusion of other aspect s of the medical decisionmaking process. Third, courts must grapple with difficu lties po sed by the impact o f hindsight on the litig ation process. Su ch pro blems arise in a number of contexts, an d if no t reso lved satisfact orily may en danger the integrity o f the courts' truth-see king function. Two closely related instances of su difficu lties inv olve wheth er inform ation that was no t disclosed was \" material\" to the patient (that is, \"wh en a reason able person in wh at the physician kn ows or should know to be th e patient's position, wou ld be likely to attach sign ifican ce to th e risk or cluster of risks in deci ding whether or not to undergo the proposed therapy\"37) and whet her the provi der's failure to disc lose this inform ation \"cause d\" th e patient to under take the cour se of action that resulted in inj ury. In both instances, the patient's own testimony abo ut what would have been important to know and how that information would have affect ed his or her deci sion may be col ored by hindsight, as well as by the pat ient's recognition that different reconstructions of hypothetical past deci sions may h elp determin e wh ether the case is wo n or lost. Thu s, while in jured patients will po ssess unique insight into their own values an d choices, th e courts h ave understand ably tried to limit th e impact of possibly speculative and potentially self-serv ing testi mony.38 N.E.2d 5 30, 173 N.Y.S.2d 30 (1957), in whic h a patient in a state mental hospital was awarded $ 10,000 for an unauthori zed abortion performed on her . The damages were, h owever, r educed by the appellate court in light of testim ony that her cond ition was improved b y this term ination of pregnan cy. 36 See, e.g., Jay Katz, Informed Consent\u2014A Fairy Tale?: Law' s Vision, 39 U. PITT. L. REV. 1 37, 172 (1977). 37 This formulation was originally put forth b y Professor Jon Waltz and Thomas Scheunem an in their classic article on i nform ed cons ent and adopted, m ore or less verbat im, in the sem inal info rmed consent case of Canterbur y v. Spence, 464 F.2d 772, 788 (D.C.Cir. 1972) . See Waltz and Scheuneman, supra note 30, at 640. 38 See Canterbur y v. Spence, 464 F.2d 772 , ingly, for both determinations of th e m ateriality o f inform ation concerning risks and the existence of proxim ate cause , most courts have been drawn to what is known as an \" objective standa rd.\" This requ ires juries to consider th e issues as if they were an \"avera ge, reasona ble pe rson\" in the pos ition of th e particular patient,39 To t he degree t hat the decision of t he ave rage, reas onable pat ient would differ from the perhaps idiosyncratic deci sion of a particular patient, the law's objectiv e stan dard fails to support th patient's righ t self- determination.40 Neve rtheless, a more su bjective standa rd, attuned to the values of each pe rson, coul d pose serious practical this stan dard attemp ts to protect ag ainst the dangers of hindsight, the physician s' bu rdens may still be increased since it is impossible to control fully th e degree to which a jury may actu ally consider a ny special circum stances and needs of a part icular plaintiff. In assessing whet her t he particular risk that resu lted in injury sh ould have been disclose d, the jury cannot m agically forget th at the risk in fact materialized. A jury, as t he finde r-of-fact in th e case b efore it, is n ot in a position to explore all th e practical i mplications of req uiring disclosure of a particular risk to future pat ients facing c omparabl e deci sions. Consequently, the judgments in individual cases may seem to impose overly burdensome disclosure requirements. It would be unfortunate, in the Commission's 39 See, e.g., Canterbur y v. Spen ce, .Cir. y 379 A .2d 1014, 1022 (M d. Ct. App., 19 77); Rev. Code Wash. Ann. \u00a7 7.70.050(c). 40 \"In holding that the materiality of info rmatio n is to be judged b y what the law's my thical ' reasonable perso n' woul d want to know, these courts retreate d from the logic o f their own reas oning.\" C apron, supra note 5, at 407; see also Goldstein, supra note 23; Joseph King, In Search of a Standard of Care for th e Medica l Profession: The \"Accepted Practice\" Formula, 28 1265 5); Riskin , supra note 23, at . 41 Although acknowledging th e practical diff iculties attend ant up on the use of a subjectiv e test of causation , the Nort h Carolin a Supreme Court neverth adopted th e test because \" [t]he detrim ents of th e objec tive st andard are m ore severe.\" The court continued by stating: In determ ining liability by whether a r easonable person would have subm itted to treatment had h e known of the r isk that the defendan t failed to relate, no consideration is gi ven to th e peculiar qu irks an d idios yncracies of the indiv idual. His supposedly inviolable righ t to decid e for himself what is to b e done with his bod y is made subject to a standar d set b y others. The right to base one's consent on proper information is effec tively vit iated for thos e wit h fears , apprehensions, relig ious belie fs, or superstitions outside th e mainstream of society. McPherson v. Ellis, No. 147 A81 , slip op. at 2-3 (N.C. Mar ch 3, 1982). 28 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 1 opinion, if these leg al interventions resulted in physicians feelin g compelled to recite fo rmally a parade of all risk s remotely asso ciated with eac h alternative treatm ent. Such recitations ca n be so overwhelming that patients are un able to distinguish truly significan t informatio n and to make sound decisions. A m ore appropri ate course, albeit a more demanding one, w ould be for the courts to consider the practical implications o f requiring disclosure of a part icular risk\u2014a nd of all comparable risks\u2014to all p atients facing com parable decisions. The fou rth influence of the litig ation process on the evolution of informed consent law is th at co urts m ust determine wh ether req uired disclos ures in ag ain, relian ce on after-th e-fac t testimony by patient or provider may be less th an satisfacto ry. As in many other legal contexts, written documentation of disclosure and consent can provide use ful evidence\u2014 hence, th e ubiquitous \"inf ormed consent form .\"43Unfortunately, all too often s uch form s can becom e a substitu te fo r, rath er than merely a record of, a co ntinual process of disclosure, discussi on, and conse nt. If providers co me to bel ieve (prob ably incorrectly44) that th eir ob ligation to ob tain th e patient's informed cons ent can be sat isfied by secu ring a si gnature\u2014e ven i f a patient is drowsy, drugged, or confused or the form is abst ruse, jargon- ridden, or largely u nintelligible\u2014the law's i nclination to rely on written 42 Inform ed co nsent cas es alm ost inevitab ly lead to \" testimonial cont ests\" in which pat ients c laim that they were not warn ed of the risks tha t befel l them , and doctors claim that warnings were is sued. See, e .g., Bloskas v. Murray , 618 P.2d 719, 720-21 So.2d 2 .E.2d , 130 2 (Mass. 1977). This problem also aros e in older \"consent\" cases befo re the dev elopment of th e informed consen t requir ement. See, e.g., Beatty v. Cullingworth, 44 CENT. L. J. 153 (Q.B. 1896) (unreported) . 43 Because con sent form s are often con clusorily word ed\u2014tha t is, the patient acknowledg es th at he has r eceiv ed info rmation or \"adequate\" in formation abou t risks, benefits , alternatives, etc., but the form does not actu ally recite this information\u2014at best they will pr otect the physician against a suit for batter y, but not for neglig ent failur e to disclo se. Note, 44 B ROOKLYN L. REV. 241, 260 (1978). Actually providing full information to patients is no t alway s the go al of consent form s; rather , \"avoidin g this risk [of l iability] seems to be a pr imary concern of tho se who draft what are s trangely ca lled 'in formed cons ent forms'....\" Gold stein, supra note 23, at 692. 44 Merely obtaining a p atient's signature on a consent form d oes not provid e airtigh t insulat ion against liab 649 ( Ct. App. 1973) . Although no in formed consent statutes r equire that consent be obtain ed in writing, so me statutes conf er a \"presumption of validi ty\" on a written consen t. It is not clear, however, that such a presum ption works an y substantial ch ange in the common law. See Meisel and 1 , at 469-76 . Decisionm aking 29 documentation may pervert its cen tral purpose in requ iring informed consent. Finally, th e stru cture of lawsu its requires the nam ing of particular defendants who will b ear fi nancial resp onsib ility in the er indiv idually o r, more typ ically, through their liability in surers. Injured patients may bring claim s against all p ersons associated wit h their ca re, but clai ms are typically directed a gainst parties with \"d eep pockets,\" u sually in stitutions and ind ividual physicians . This pattern does not necessarily reflect the acti vities of othe r members o f the health care tea m, particularly n urses, with regard to informing patients and securi ng their con sent. Thus, the liti gation process h as sh aped th e leg al doctrine of inform ed cons ent.The nature of the cases com ing before the courts led to a particular perspectiv e on the character, failing s, and potential o f relationships between pat ients and heal th care pr oviders. The exi stence of an i njury led cou rts to conce ntrate on w hether t here ha d bee n disclosure of the particular risks o f the m edical proce dure rather tha n to an ev aluation of the process of patient-professional communication as a whole. The need to avoid giving undue weight to a patient's after-the- fact, sp eculative, an d potentially self-serv ing testim ony reg arding materiality and causat ion led to an o bjective standard that can contra dict individual patients' particular values or desi res. And the need t o identify legal respo nsibility an d potential fin ancial liab ility led to a particular view of the appropriate roles of m embers of the health care tea m. Taken together, th ese h ave brought the current law to an un easy co mpromise among et hical aspirations, t he realitie s of medical prac tice, and t he exigencies of the litig cess.45 Law, Ethics, and Medic al Prac tice. The realities o f court decision s on informed con sent thu s fall sh ort of th e law's professed commit ment to the value of self-d etermination. Since \"the c ourts imposed primarily a duty-to-warn on physicians,\" 45 Sever al of the major judicial opinions articulating (and broadening) the leg al right to informed consent came in appellate d ecisions reversing judgments at th e trial court level, ty pically on the ground that the district cour t's instructions to the jury improperl y confined the jur y's ability to find in favor of the plain tiff. Thus, the appel late courts, which are somewhat m ore removed from the exigencies of trial work , have been m ore will ing to expand the scope of req uired disclosure. Further, the practical result of these appel late decis ions is not the award of damages, but r ather the r eturn of the c ase for r etrial und er the pro per (broad ened) legal standard . Thus, the ultim ate questions of liabilit y and d amages still have to be determined b y a jur y. Even under the broaden ed standard the jur y may decid e that the prov ider met the oblig ation of disclosure or that the lack of disclosure d id not, in light o f the medical indications favori ng the proc edure, \"cause\" the patient's decisio n to und ergo the procedure, thereby resulting in injury. 30 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 1 thereby avoiding a judicial reco gnition of the proposition that patients have a decisive role to play in the medical deci sionmaking process , they have merely reinforce d \"phys icians' tra ditional m onologue of talking at and n ot with patien ts.\"46As a resu lt they hav e missed the opportunity to move toward what is nee ded: \"a new and unaccust omed dialogue thei r patients ...in whic h both, a ppreciative o f their resp ective in equalities, mak e a genuine effo rt to voice an d clarif y their uncertain ties and then to arrive at a m utually satisfacto ry cou rse of while reco gnizing the difficu lty o f the task , believes that \"shared decisio nmaking\" is th e ap propriate id eal fo r patient-professional relationships that a s ound doctrine of i nformed consent shou ld su pport,48The Co mmissio n doubts that this will o ccur, howe ver, if prim ary reliance is placed on t he courts. T his is not to sa y that p resent leg al requ iremen tsfor inform ed consent sho uld be aban doned or red uced in scope. Current law serv es the im portant purpose of en couraging heal th care pr ofessionals to disclose important facts to patients and not to proceed with medical interventions unless patients have consente d. The law als o serve s a criti cal moral and educative ro le in proclaimin g (even if no t always fu lly en forcing) the value of self-determination. These f unctions can a nd should co ntinue.

Shared Decisionm aking 31 The litigation process itself seriously limits the law's a bility to reach into an intimate relatio nship so as to foster a g enuine dialogue between health care professionals and their patients.49 Not only is the Co mmissio n doubtful that laws or reg ulation s can fu lly b ring ab out sh ared decisionmaking bet ween patient and profess ional, but it is conce rned t hat efforts to do so may have unintended and deleterious side effects. Nevertheless t he Co mmissio n does no t believe that th e ideal o f better informed co nsent should be aba ndoned. In subsequent portions of this Rep ort the Co mmissio n attempts to define the ideal m ore precisely and t o suggest a num ber o f means i n addition to statutes and judicial decisions that could move d ay-to-day medical practice closer t o shared decisionmaking. The Context of Consent The C ommission believes that an anal ysis of \"the ethical and legal implicatio ns of requirements for informed consent to...under go medical procedures\"50 is best undertaken in the context of a broade r exam ination of relationships bet ween patients and health care p rofessi onals in American soci ety. At issue i s the definition of the patient- profession al relatio nship, as well as th e ap propriate role of form al and inform al modes of social reg ulation in shaping it. Cle arly, th e reso lution of th ese issues requires m ore th an a sim ple rev iew of the existin g law of informed consent. Th us, the remainder of th is Repo rt co nsiders patterns of com munication between patients and health care professionals and how decisions are m ade. These inquiries are framed by the Commissio n's ultimate question abou t this asp ect of its work : how can a fuller, shared understanding by patient and profession al of their common enterprise be promoted, s o that patients can participate, on an inform ed basis and to the ext ent they care to do so, in making decisions about their health ca re? Histori cal Development .While the law has proclaimed, if not always given effect to, su ch propositions as \"Anglo- 49 Cour ts may not, in an y event , be inc lined to enforc e trul y shared decis ionmaking , even if the y were able to do s o. Law has often been relu ctant to intrude on the autonom y of th e medical profession, out of defer ence to medical expert ise, respe ct for the values of l ife and heal th served by the medical profession, and perhaps an unspoken recogni tion that rules cr eated for h ealth professiona ls may some day be applied to the legal profession as well.

Gradu ally, a new understand ing of the proper lev els an d limits o f health care is emerging; from th is flo w changes in the relativ e rights and obligations of patients a nd professionals c once rning m atters such as disclos ure and consent for m edical interventi ons. Perhaps the most sig nifican t sing le factor in th is process is t he emergence of the scientific, t echnolo gical approach t o medical care ove r the course of the past century. The rapidly evol ving technical prowess of medicine ha s, of course, brought with it im proved health , greater quality and length of life, and new sources of hope for th e ill. Th is revo lution in the cap acities o f medicine has also had profound effects on the stru cture of the heal th care del ivery system and on t he nat ure of t he pat ient- professional relationshi p. Seve ral of t hese chan ges a re pa rticularly relevant to informed consent. First, h ealth care is n ow provided in a vast array o f setting s, ranging from home visits b y trad itional famil y doctors t o clinics, health maintenance o rganizations, and multispecialty group pract ices, to nursing homes an d other lo ng-term or chron ic care facilities, to high-techno logy tertiary care cen ters. Care is freq uently by teams onals whose individual respo nsibilities may be defined l ess by the ove rall needs o f the pat ient than by particular disease s or organ sy stems. W hen this occu rs there may be no si ngle professional in effectiv e comman d of th e entire care of the patient, no one who knows the patient well an d to who m the patient may turn for in formation, advice, and comfort. In suc h instances the health care syste m's increase d capacity and determ ination to overc ome a disease or defect m ay be accom panied by a diminished capacity and inclination to care for the patient in m ore hu man term s.58 Such situations po se a far m ore seri ous threat to patient well- being and aut onomy than any formal disclosu re of rem ote ris ks on informed consent forms could possi bly rem edy. Indeed, the Commission believes that seriou s effo rts by health care in stitutions to ensure that patients have one identifiab le and reliab le source of informatio n concerning thei r care would do far more to rem edy the cu rrent ills of the health care syste m than wou ld legal prescrip tions with which co mpliance can be neither assumed nor enforced.59 58 Dissatisfaction b y both patients a nd some professionals with these depersonalizing tenden cies of modern medicin e is sugge sted b y the renaissance of int erest in ho listic medicin e and the rise of the self-car e movement. 59 The prob lems of not having on e person coor dinating c are are il lustrated in this quote from a patient with leukemia: I kept fighting through all the fevers and transfusions. I felt I could only survive it b y insisting on control. And there would 34 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapter 1 The ex panded potential of m edicine has al so widened the ran ge of choices a bout health care. Increasin gly, th e qu estion is n ot sim ply whether to accep t a single interv ention that is av ailab le for a particular condition, bu t which interventio n to choo se. Often the altern atives vary markedly in their prospects for su ccess, their intrusi veness, t heir potential sid e effects, and their o ther implicatio ns for p atients' ab ility to conduct their li ves as t hey see fit. A determ ination of what is \"indicated\" is th us inextricab ly in tertwin ed with the needs and valu es of th e particular patient. These cha nges in medicine have been ac companied by broader trends in Am erican society and culture that h ave rein forced their im pact. Since t he earl y 1960s t here has bee n an extraordinary emphasi s on t he rights of citizens t o direct the course of their liv es, fro m voting rights to consumer rights. This stress on the individual has been coupled with a skepticism toward claim s of specialized expertise and a suspicion of powerfu l institutions and the \"estab lishmen t.\" Health care h as not escap ed its sh are of criticis m in the pro cess. Some commentators have seen in these trend s the basis for a n ew view of the role of medicine a nd the nature of the patient-provider relationship: The t raditional paternal model of m edicine was p remised on t rust in the ph ysician 's tech nical com petence an d moral sen sitivity an d was charact erized by patient dependency and physician control. This model is being replaced gradually by one in which patients are increasi ngly involved in decisionmaking conce rning their own medical care. The rise of cons umerism and the a ssociated em ergence of \"rights\" language in medicine has encouraged some individuals to view m edicine as a be plen ty of ch ances to test m y resolve.

For th e sak e of simp licity, wh ile recognizing t he caricatures involv ed, these may be refe view of health profession als\u2014typ ically physician s\u2014as th e dominant, authoritarian figu re in th e relatio nship, with both the rig ht and the respo nsibility to make decisio ns in the medical best interests of the patient. In reaction to this view, some have sought to take over the physician 's do minant position. Propo r and control over all decisio ns abou t their own care. Accord ing to this view, practitio ners sh ould act as serv ants of their patients, tran smitting medical information and using their tech nical sk ills as th e patient directs, witho ut seeking to influence the patient's decisions, m uch less actually make them. Both position s atte mpt to vest ex clusive moral ag ency, eth ical wisdom, and deci sionmaking aut hority on one si de of the rel ationship, while assi gning the other side a depe ndent role. In the view of the Commission, neither e xtreme adequate ly reflects the current nat ure and needs of heal th care. T he debate has increasingly bec ome an arid exercise, whic h the Commis sion belie ves s hould be re placed by a vie w that reflects the trem endous divers ity o f health care situ ations and relatio nships today. In this Report, th e Co mmission attempts to shift th e terms of t he discussi on toward how to foster a rel ationship bet ween patients and profe ssionals characte rized by and respect and by share d deci sionmaking. T he Commission bel ieves such a shift in focus will do better justice to the realities o f health care an d to the ethical values underlying th e inform ed conse nt doctrine. Although described in a si ngle phrase, the Commission's view is intende d to encom pass a multitude of diffe rent realities, each one sha ped by the pa rticular m edical enc ounter a nd eac h one s ubject to cha nge as the particip ants mo ve toward acco mmodation through the process o f shared decisionmaking: The nature of th e patient involved\u2014his personality, ch aracter, attitu de, and valu es\u2014an d the facto rs which led him to seek a medical encounte r with this pa rticular physician a re central compone nts of the proces s. Similarly, the personality, character, attitu de, values, and techn ical sk ills o f the p hysician affect th e accomm odation. Furt her, the quality of the interaction betwee n patient and physician \u2014the chemistry of the interactio n\u2014m odify the process . Of course, the na ture of the medical p roblem, including its type, ac uteness, gravity, Shared Deci sionmaking 37 and its potential for rem ediation, will be a maj or determinant of whether a physician -patient accomm odation is achie ved. Fo r example, th e entire pro cess w ill be modified profoundly an d telesco ped if the patien t is acu tely o r critically il l and altern ative medical resources are unavai lable. Fi nally, other considerations whic h m ay affect t he ac hievem ent of a physician- patien t accomm odation incl ude the clinical setting, e.g., a ho spital, doctor's office, o r the patient's home; the organization of t he medical serv ice, Health Main tenance Or ganization, or fee-for- service; a nd claim s of rele vant t hird part y interests su ch as tho se of family, in surers, or the state.65 At each point , the patient and physician will arrive at a j oint decision in which the physician agrees to care for t he patient and the patient agrees to be treate d by the physician. The pa rticular resol ution of rights and re sponsi bilitie s reached at a given point of the relationship may ch ange with tim e an d circu mstances. Th e resilien cy of t he relatio nship will d epend importantly on the ex tent of trust an d confidence exchanged between patient and professiona1.66 Whet her societ y should a ccept wh atever acc omm odation the parties agree t o regarding the com munication pr ocess a nd the allocation o f decisionm aking authority is a com plex issue.

T he cont ractual view has st rong roots in American traditions of voluntarism and individual respo nsibility. Yet fo r reason s of h istory, tradition, expectation s, and disparities i n education al, class, an d hea lth status, pat ients and professionals often start out on substan tially u nequal foo ting, raising serious qu estion s about the ability of many patients to have an effective role in shaping the relationship. Through law, American soci ety has re gulated relationships between patien ts and health care practitio ners for almo st a cen tury. The con trol of advertising by doctors (to prevent the deception of unknowing patients) and the licen sing of practitio ners (to prohibit quackery an d estab lish minimum standar ds of expertise) ar e some of the earli est exam ples. Medical malpractice law and crim inal law also estab lish some limits on the freed om of practitio ners in the interests of patients. Info rmed consent is merely one of th e newer ways th at society 65 Id. at 62. 66 Id. at 63. 38 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 1 places s ome limits on the range of relationshi ps betwee n patients a nd practitio ners. The mmission that con siderable flex ibility s hould be accorde d to patients and professionals to define the term s of t heir own relationships. The resol ution fa vored by the C ommission i s a presumption that cert ain fundam ental types of i nformation should be made avai lable to patients and that all patients com petent to do so have a right to acce pt or re ject m edical inte rventions a ffecting the m. Sim ilarly, a professional who has bee n as flexible about possible ave nues of treatm ent as hi s orher bel iefs an d standards al low is not gene rally obligate d to accede t o the patient in a way that vi olates the bounds of acceptable m edical practice or the provide r's own deeply held m oral beliefs. Nevertheless, i n light of the disparities b etween the positions of the parties, t he interactio n shou ld, at a minimum, provi de the patient with a basis for effectiv e particip ation in sound decisio nmaking reg partic ular form of the accomm odation. It will usual ly consist o f discussi ons between professional and patient that bring the knowledge, conce rns, and pers pective of each to the process of see king agreem ent on a course of treatm ent.67Simply put, this mean s that the physician or other heal th professi onal invites the pat ient to participate in a dialogue in which the professio nal seek s to help the patient understand the medical situation an d available courses of act ion, and the pat ient conveys his or her c once rns and wishes.68This does not involve a mechani cal recitation of abstruse m edical information, but should include disclosures that give the pat ient an understanding of his or her condition and an appreci ation of its consequences. The C ommission e ncourages, to perhaps a greater de gree than is explicitly recognize d by current law, the ability of patients and health care professionals to vary the style and extent of discussion from that mandated by this general presumption. Such variations m ight take any of several directions: in one relationship, the patient might prefer not to be 67 The Com mission's focus in this discussion on th e pro cess of reach ing agreement is qu ite deliber ate. For perh aps understandable reaso ns, much of the scholarl y legal and philosophical literatur e concentrat es on the \" hard case,\" the case in which n o agre ement c an be re ached: wh en it comes to the crun ch, who ultim ately has the power to deci de? Although such questions can not be ignored, the Com mission's effort in this Report is to re adjust the ba lance toward full er consideration of those less dramatic issues that a rise routine ly in the da y-to-d ay practice of r esponsible medicin e and nursi ng but that hav e receiv ed less atten tion and emphasis. 68 This image of reach ing out to a pati ent is captured well in th e following: \" The skillful doctor, m etaphoricall y speaking, throws out a rope to the patien t drowning in illn ess and b y enco uraging the p atient to hold on furt hers the hea ling process.\" Abram, supra note 59 , at 116 . Shared Decisionm aking 39 burdened by detailed discussi on of risks unlikely to arise or to affect the decision; in another relationship, a patient might req uest unusually detailed informatio n on unconventional altern ative therapies; in a third, a patient with a longstanding and cl ose relationship of trust with a particular physician might ask t hat physician to proceed as he or s he thinks best, choosing the course of t herapy and reveal ing any information that th e physician thinks wo uld best serve th e interests o f the patient. Inherent in allowing such variations i s the difficulty of ensuring they are genuinely agreeable to both parties and do not them selves arise out of an imbalance in status or ba rgaining power. The health professional's expert knowledge, fo cused through the particular diagnosis and prognosis for the patient, usually confers on that person the natural ro le of lead er an d initiato r in building this sh ared understanding. The patient, on the other hand, is especially well placed to assess th e overall effects o f the m edical co ndition and possible treatm ents, in light of his or her own particular goals and val ues. Thus each party brings to the relations hip special knowledge a nd perspectives that can help to clarify for both parties what is actu ally at issu e in an y decision to be reached. The Commission is aware th at its d escrip tion of m utual particip ation and s sets a hi gh ideal. Both professi onal and patient in this dialogue are liable to misund erstandings and confusions, false hope or despair, unvoiced fear s, anxiety, and questions. E ven when each is sensitive to the presence of these barrie rs to full understa nding and seek s to su rmount them in the interest of agreeing on their co mmon venture\u2014that is, treating the pa tient successfully\u2014difficulties will persist. Yet it rem ains a g oal worth striving toward . In this Repo rt the Commissio n not only fills o ut the contours of the concept sketched here but also explores its roots in basi c values and in contemporary opinion and i ts implications f or the education of health professionals, the del ivery of care, th e attitu des of patients and providers, an d the rules of so ciety as expressed through the law. 2 The Values Underlying Informed Consent What a re the values t hat ought to guide decision making in the provider-patient relationship or by which the success of a pa rticular interactio n can b e judged? The Commissio n finds two to be central: promotion o f a pat ient's we ll-being an d respect for a p atient's sel f- determination.1 Before turning to the compone nts of informed conse nt (Part Two of this Report) or the means fo r promoting its achi evement (Part Th ree), t hese cen tral valu es will b e explored. They are in many ways co mpatible, bu t their potential fo r con flict in actu al practice must be recognized.2 1 Although th ese prin ciples hav e been disc ussed in jud icial decisions and legal commentar y on informed consen t, the concern of the Commission with patien t- provider communication and with decisi onmaking in health care in gener al causes it to consi der the issue in a way that is broa der and m ore co mplex than the legal doctrin e. The im plication s of this discussion for law are noted at appropriate poin ts, however, and conclusi ons about those imp lications are give n in Part Three. 2 Pursuit of the se two values is constr ained in various way s, most notably by society's overa ll interes t in equit y, justice, and maximum social welfare . Thes e issues are the cen tral conc erns ofthe Co mmission's forthcoming repor t SECURING AC CESS TO HEALTH CARE. Because these goals need no t be centr al to the de cisionmaking proces s of patients and providers, this report does not take up th e complications ar ising from conflicts betwe en leg itimate soc ietal goals and ind ividual p atient go als. The Commission's forthco ming erapy exp hip between s ocietal and ind ividual concerns in the context of a particu lar set of health care decisions. 42 Making Health Car e Decisions: Ch apter 2 Serving the P atient's Well-Being Therapeutic in terventions are in tended first and forem ost to improve a pat ient's heal th. In m ost circum stances, people agree in a gene ral way on what \"improved health\" means. R estoration of normal functioning (such as t he repair of a fractured limb) and avoi dance of untimely deat h (such as m ight occur without the use of antibiotics to control life-threaten ing infectio ns in otherwise healthy persons) are obvious exam ples. Health care is, in turn, usually a means of promoting patients' well- being. The connection bet ween a particular health care decision and an individual's well-being is not pe rfect, however. First, the definition of health can be quite controversial: does wrinkled skin or uncommonly short statu re con stitute im paired health , such that su rgical repai r or growth hormone is appropriate? Even more s ubstantial variation can be found in ranking the importance of health with other goals in an individual's life. For s ome, healt h is a param ount value; for others\u2014ci tizens wh o volunteer i n time of war, n urses who care f or patients with contagious di seases, han g-glider enthusiasts wh o risk life and limb\u2014a different goal sometimes has primacy. Absence of Objecti ve Medi cal Criteria. Even the most mundane case\u2014in which there is little if an y disagreement that some in tervention will p romote health \u2014may well h ave no objectiv e medical criteria th at specify a singl e best way to achieve the goal. A fracture d limb can be repaired in a number of ways; a life- threaten ing infectio n can be treated with a variety o f antibiotics; mild diabetes is subject to control by diet, by inj ectab le natural in sulin, or b y oral syn thetic in sulin substitutes. Health care professi onals oft en reflect their own value preferences whe n they favo r one altern ative ov er ano ther; many are m atters of choice, dictated nei ther by biomedical principles or data nor by a single, ag reed- upon professional standard. In the C ommission's s urvey it wa s clear that professi onals recogn ize th is fact: p hysician s maintained that decision al au thority betwee n them and their pat ients shou ld dep end on the nature of the decision at hand. Thus, for example, whet her a pre gnant woman over 3 5 should have amniocent esis was viewed as largely a patient's decision, whereas the decisio n of which antibiotic to use for strep t hroat was seen as pri marily up to the doctor. Furtherm ore, on the question of whet her to continue aggre ssive treatm ent for a cancer patient with metastases in whom such tre atment had already faile d, two-thirds of the physicians felt it was n ot a scien tific, m edical decisio n, but o ne that turned prin cipally on personal values. A nd the sam e proportion felt the deci sion sh ould be made jointly (which 64% of the doctors claimed it usually was) . Values Underlying Informed Conse nt tes h ealth and how it is b est promoted also requires k nowledg e of patients' s ubjective prefe rences. In pursuit of the other goals and interests besid es health that society d eems legitimate, patients may prefer one type of medical intervention to another, may opt for no treatment at all, o r may even request so me treat ment when a pract ititoner wou ld prefer to follow a more cons ervat ive course that involved, at least for t he moment, no m edical intervention. F or example, a sl ipped di sc m ay be treated surgically or wi th medications a nd bed rest. Which treatment is better ca n be unclear, eve n to a physi cian. A patient may prefer surgery because, despite its greater risks, in the past that indi vidual has spent considerable time in bed a nd bec ome dem oralized and dep ressed. A person with an injured knee, wh en told that su rgery h as about a 3 0% chance of reducing pain but almost no chance of elim inating it entirely, may prefer t o leave the c ondition un treated . And a baseball pitcher with persisten t inflamma tion of the elb ow may prefer to take cortisone on a continuing basis ev en though th e doctor sugg ests th at a n ew position on the team woul d elim ea case the go als and interests of p articular patients incline them in differen t directions not only as to how, but even as to whether, treatment shoul d proceed. Given these two considerations\u2014the frequent absence of objective medical criteria and the leg itimate subject ive pre ferences of pat ients\u2014 ascertaining whet her a he alth care intervention will, if successful , promote a pat ient's wel l-being is a matter of i ndividual judgment. Societies that respect pers onal freedom usually reach s uch decisions by leaving the judg ment to the person involved. The Boundaries of He alth Care .This does not mean, ho wever, that well-b eing and self-d eterm ination are really j ust two ter ms for the same value. For example, when a n individual (suc has a newborn baby) is una ble to express a choice, the value that guide s health ca re decision making is th e pro motion of well-b eing-not necessarily an easy task but also certainly not merely a disguised form of sel f-determination. Moreover, the promotion of well-being is an important value eve n in decisi ons a bout patients who ca n spea k for themselves beca use the boundaries of the interventions that heal th profes siona ls present for consideration are set b y the co ncept of well- being. T hrough s ocietal expectation s and the trad itions of th e pro fessio ns, health care prov iders are co mmitted to helping patients and to avoiding harm. Thus, the well- being principle circum scribes the range of altern atives offered to patients: informed consent does not mean that patients can insist upon anything they might want . Rather, i t is a choi ce am ong medically accepted and a vailable options, all of whic h 44 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapter 2 are b elieved to have some possibility o f promoting the patient's wel fare. including al ways the opt ion of no further medical interventions, even when that would not be viewed as prefera ble by the health care providers. In sum, prom otion of pat ient wel l-being pro vides the primary warrant for health care. But, as indicated, well-being isnot a concrete concept that has a si ngle definition or that is so lely with in the competency of health care provide rs to define . Share d decisionm aking requires that a practitioner seek not only to understand each patient's needs and deve lop reas onable alternativ es to meet those nee ds but also to presen t the altern atives in a way th at enables patients to choos e one they prefer. To participate in this process, p atients must en gage in a dialogue with the practitio ner and mak e their v iews on well-b eing clear. Th e majority of ph ysician s (56%) and the pu blic (64 %) surveyed by the Commissio n felt th at in creasing the patient's role in medical decision making would improve the quality o f health care.3 Since well- being ca n be de fined only within each individual's expe rience , it is in congrue nt to sel f-determ ination, to which th e Report now turns. Respecting Self - Determi nation Self-determ ination (s ometimes ter med \"autonom y\") is an individual's exercise of the capacity to form, revi se, and pursue personal plans for life.4 Altho ugh it clearly h as a m uch broad er application , the releva nce of self-determ ination in he alth care decisions seem s undeniable.

The val ue of self- determination read ily e merges if on e co nsiders wh at is lo st in its absence. If a physician sele cts a tr eatment altern ative that satisfies a patient's ind ividual values and goals rath er than allowing the patient to choose , the absence of self-determ ination has not interfered with the promotion of the pat ient's wel l-being. But unl ess t he pat ient has requested this co urse of con duct, the indiv idual will n ot have b een shown proper respect as a person no r provided with ad equate pro tectio n against arbitrary, albeit often well-meaning, domination by others. Self- determination can thus be seen as bo th a sh ield and a sword . Freedom fr om interferenc e. Self-d eterm ination as a shield is valued for the freedom from outside co ntrol it is intended to provide.

Moreov er, denying self-d eterm ination in this way risks ge nerating the frustration people feel whe n their des ires are i gnored or countermanded . The po tential fo r dissatisfactio n in this reg ard is great. In the Commission's sur vey, 72% of the public said that they woul d pre fer to make decisions jointly with their physicians after treatm ent altern atives have been explained. In contrast, 88% of the physicians bel ieve that patien ts want doctors to choo se for th em the best alternativ e. Desp ite these d ifferences in perception, on ly 7 % of th e public repo rts dissatisfaction with their doctors' resp ect for their tre atment prefe rences self-agency. As a sword, self-determ ination m anifests the value t hat Western c ulture places on eac h person having t he free dom to be a creator\u2014 \"a subject, not an obje ct.\"7With in the broad fram ework of personal char acteristics fixed d uring t he years of devel opment, individuals define their own particular val ues.8In these ways, individuals are cap able of creatin g their o wn character an d of taking respo nsibility for the kind of person they are. R espect for sel f-determination thus promotes personal integration within a cho sen life-style. This is an es pecially important goal to be nourished regarding health care. If it is n ot fostered regarding such personal matters, it may not arise ge nerally regar ding public matters. The sen se of pe rsonal respon sibility fo r decisionmaking is o ne of the wel lsprings of a democracy. Similarly, wh en p eople feel litt le real p ower over their lives\u2014in the eco nomy, in political affairs, o r even in their d aily interactio ns wi th other people and institutions\u2014it is no t surprising that they are passi ve in e ncounters with health care profes sionals. If people have been a ble to form their own values and goals , are free from manipulation, a nd are aware of information rel evant to the deci sion at hand, the final aspect of self-d eterm ination is sim ply the aware ness that the choice is th eir o wn to make. Although the reas ons for a choice cannot always b e defined, decisio ns are still au tonomous if th ey reflect someone's o wn pu rposes rather than external cau ses unrelated to the person's \"self.\" Conseque ntly, th e Commis sion's con cept 6 This finding s hould be viewed cautiously since it is well known that survey s overstat e the extent of actual satisfactio n, as measured during on- site in terviews immediately following doctor-p atient en counters. 7 Berlin, supra note 5. 8 This is not to den y, of course, p eople' s interdep endence nor the way s in which each p erson's values are inf luenced b yothers.

Values Underlying Informed Consent 47 of health care deci sionmaking includes informing pat ients of al ternative courses of trea tment and of t he reasoning behind all recommendations. Self-d eterm ination involves more th an ch oice; it also requ ires knowledge. The importance of info rmation to self-d etermin ation emerged in th e Commissio n's stu dy of treat ment refu sals in hospitals. Th ere it was found that, regarding routine treatm ents, information was frequently so lacking that patient self-d etermin ation was co mpromised. Often patients we re not told what treatment or procedure had been ordered for them, much less asked t o decide w hether or n ot to accept it. The purpose of the procedure was fre quently obsc ure and the risks com monly went unmentioned. Present ation of altern atives was ex traord inarily rare.

First, s ome objectives are so contrary to the public in terest o r the interests o f others th at so ciety bars the use of m edical interve ntions towa rd these e nds. For e xample, physicians may 9 Paul S. App elbaum and Lo ren H. Roth, Treatment Re fusal In Medica l Hospitals (1982), Appendix D, in Volume Two of this Report.

The Appel baum-Roth te am observed house-staff/patient interacti ons extensively but generall y did not have a chance to observe inter actions between attendi ng ph ysicians and patien ts. One woul d expect that discussions of major treat ments and procedures, especially majo r surgical proced ures, which were more often left to th e attendings, might correspond more closely to th e doctrin e of inf ormed consent. However, th e investigators' co nclusions are pr obably valid for the discussions about diagnostic procedures , medications, and adjunctive therapies as discuss ed in the other observation al stud y condu cted for the Commission. See Charle s W. Lidz and Alan M eisel, Informed Consent and the Stru cture of Med ical Care (1982), Appendix C, in Volume Two of this Repor t. 48 Making Health Car e Decisions: Ch apter 2 not assist patients in crimin al activ ity (su ch as defacing fingertips so will n ot leav e identifiab le fing erprints). The p rofession al norms or moral integrity o f health care profession als (i ndividually, or co llectiv ely in health care in stitutions) may also conflict with the desires o f a patient. When this occurs, th e practitio ner must first reex amine his or her own beliefs and preconce ptions. If the proposed intervention would act ually compromise th e provider's integ rity o r stand ards, the patient will eith er have t o accept the limitation on a vailable interventions or seek anothe r health care provider. Finally, a particular treatment preferred by a patient occasionally calls on ve ry scarce res ources that society (or s ome legitimate reso urce-con trolling segment of the health care syste m) has decided to allocate to anot her use. Ev en as a \"sword,\" self-determ ination does not invest a pat ient with rights to dem and use o f reso urces that have legitimately been allocated to o thers\u2014as in th e case, for example, of a patient who ca nnot ha ve elective surg ery on a desire d date because all beds in a hospital are bei ng used by disaster victims. A sec ond lim itation on sel f-determ ination arises whe n a person's decisionmaking is so defective or mistaken t hat the decision fails to promote the perso n's own values or g oals. This can ha ppen in many ways: som eone could fail to understand relevant information, such as the risks of a particular treatmen t, or unconscio usly d istort unpleasan t information, s uch as the frightening diagnosis of cancer, and s o forth. For e xample, a man in the pri me of a ful l and rewa rding life who has great plans for the future suddenly suffers a myocardial in farctio n in the middle of a poker gam e in which he has already won handsomely. Yet he refuses to permit himself to be transported to a hos pital because he wants to play out his hand. The quality of his decision making cap acity is certain ly in doubt. If his expressed wishes a re res pected nonetheless, t he resul ts in terms of sel f-determination wo uld be m ixed. Sel f-det ermina- tion would be promoted in the sens e that he has made the deci sion for himself, as opp osed to having som eone else make i t, but self- determination wo uld be co ntravened in that the deci sion is not the one that would best advance the man's apparent wish to live a long, full life. Self-d eterm ination is valuable in bo th its ro les\u2014in letting an individual be his or her own deci sionmaker and in securing each person's own goals. In situations where there is a c hoice of respecting the ind ividual's decision or overriding it\u2014th at is, of favoring one asp ect of self-determination at the ex pense of the other\u2014overriding an individual decision is usually justified on t he ground of promotion of well-bei ng rather tha n of respect fo r self -choice.10 10 Likewise, self-determination is not an adequate guiding prin ciple reg arding decisions for persons who suffer permanent o r chronic Values Underlying Informed Conse nt 49 The absence of c ontemporaneous c hoice. Sometimes pe ople anticipate th at they will b e unab le to participate in future decisio ns about their own health care. A patient, fo r exam ple, m ay be under a nesthesia during surgery at a time whe n diagnostic tests force a decision about a furth er operation. Sim ilarly, p atients with an early d iagnosis of senile dementia o f the Alzh eimer's typ e can expect that their physic al functioning mig ht continue long after th ey are m entally incapable of deciding a bout care. T hrough an \"a dvance directive\" s uch people can specify t he types of ca re they wa nt (or do not want) to receive or the person they want to make such decisions if they are una ble to do s o.11 Honori ng such a directive shows eterm ination in that it fulfills two of its th ree underlying values. First, fo llowing a d irectiv e, particularly o ne that gives specific instructions about types of a ccepta ble a nd unacce ptable interventions, fulfills by prov iding reass urance conduct promotes th e patient's subj ectiv e, individual evaluation of well-being. Seco nd, honoring the directive shows respect for the pat ient as a pers on. To disregard it woul d be nearl y as great an i nsult as to disre gard the wishes of a patient who e xpresse s them at that time. An adva nce directive does not, ho wever, provide self-d etermin ation in the sense o f active moral agency by the pat ient on h is or her own behal f.12 Although any discussi on between pat ient and heal th care profession al lead ing up to a directiv e would involve active p articip ation and s hared decisionmaking, that would have been i n the past by the time the decision ac tually needs to be made about th e patient's health care. A t that po int, there is no \"self,\" in the activ e, mental sen se, to determine what should be done. mental impairment, such as those who are severely me ntally retarded or demented, who are in capable of form ing a set o f values or of apply ing th em in particular d ecisions. The de cisions for thes e pati ents rest instead o n an as sessment of what would promote their \" best interests\" (i.e., well-being); see pp. 178-80 infra. For an interesti ng exam ple of som e of the difficult ies tha t may exist in determining whether an indiv idual's choice reflects his or her long- term goals and values, see Albe rt R. Jonsen, Mark Siegler, and William J. W inslade , CLINICAL ETHICS, Macm illan Publishing Co., N ew York ( 1982) at 78-81. 11 In the Commission's survey , 36% of the public reported that they have given instructions to someone about h ow they would like to b e treated if they become too sick to make decisions, although onl y 23% of those instructions are in writing. 12 See generally Paul Ram sey, THE P ATIENT AS P ERSON, Yale Universit y Press, New Hav en (1970) . 50 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapter 2 Consequently, self-d estab lishes a way to project h is or her wish es in to a tim e of anticipated incapacity. Yet it is a sense of self-determin ation lack ing in one important attribute: active, cont emporaneous pe rsonal choice. He nce a decision not to fo llow an advance directiv e may so metimesbe justifie d even whe n it would not be ethical to dis regard a c ompetent patient's contemporaneous choice,13 ntly in m edical care,14it is i mportant to understand wheth er it is co mpatible with patient self-d etermin ation. First and foremost, patients must be aware t hat th ey are en titled to make a decision about treatm ent rather than merely acquiescing in a professional's recom mendat ion. Some patients feel, for exam ple, tha t making a particular treatm ent decision will cau se th em great d istress, or that the complexity and unce rtainty of certain decisions make them poor decisionmakers an d that trusted physicians or family members would be more likely to choose the treatm ent most in accord wit h the patients' own goals and values. Alternatively, som e patients sim ply wish others to decide s o that they can s pend their tim e and energy on othe r matters. This, too, co uld constitu te a tran sfer of t he right to decide. In contrast, some patients defer t o physicians beca use t hey believe they have no business i nterfering in the exercise of medical judgment. Such patients do not think they are tr ansferring thei r \"right to deci de\" to a physician be cause they do not in the first place believe they have an y right to decide about medical treatm ent. This is not an e xercise of self- determination. Rath er, self-d eterm ination occurs wh en patients understand decisions a re theirs to make\u2014an d also to countermand if they are dissatisfied.15 In ot her words, sel f-determination req uires that patients either make a choice or actually give the decisionm aking authority to ano ther, not merely fail to act out of fear or ignorance of their ri ghts.16 13 In some states, advance directives made pursua nt to a st atute may achieve \"binding\" legal effect (subject , usuall See pp. 155-66 infra. In such a case, whatever the moral justifications , one may not be legally justified in disregarding th e directions. 14 One of th e observation al studies c onducted for the Commission conclud es that \"on balance th e norm ative pat ient role in [health care decisionmaking] is one o f passive acquiescence. \" Lidz and Meisel, supra note 9, at section 6 . 15 A possible exception to this requir ement w ould be an irrevocable gran t of decisionmaking power to another, as wh en Od ysseus, wishing both to hear an d to resist the lure of th e Sirens' call, had himself tied to the m ast of his ship and instructed his crew not to release him however m uch he m ight entreat them to do so. 16 The critical element is the patie nt's attitude to ward \"involvem ent\" In recognizing that a self-det ermining person may wai ve act ive involvem ent in each d ecision, the Commissi on does not intend to belittle the moral id eal o f the free, self-gov erning person who attem pts to make decisions responsibly by applying hi s or her own val ues to relevant facts during del iberations about alternative act ions. The ideal certainl y justifies en courag ing patients to play an active part in treatment decisions and argu es for structuring medical practices and institutions in ways tha t facilitate an d encourag e effectiv e patient particip ation. Nevertheless, i t remains a moral ideal\u2014people m ay striv e to meet it b ut will o ften fall short of it. The principle of self-det ermination, the bedrock on which the Commission's conce pt of shared deci sionmaking in health care rests, is best understood as res pecting people's right to defi ne and pursue their own view of what is good, which is compatible with people freel y giving to others the authority to make particular health care decisi ons for them. Values Underlying Informed Conse nt 51 in the decision, not the mere existenc e of some \"delega tion,\" for all decisions about matters as complex as medical care require a large measure of delegation. Self-det ermination is not lacking simply because a patient does not insist that the physician rev iew the reasoning and empi rical evidenc e that led up to the physician's recommendation (an d its alternatives, if an y), including each s tand- ardiz ed laboratory test, each anatom ical or m finding , and so forth . Rather , patients' decisions ar e alway s the end p oints of a long series of earlier choices made by physicians and others (where many of the steps in action an d reasoning ar e so ingrain ed that th ose involved do not even r ecognize th em for th e choic es they are). What is at is sue, then , is merely the degree of delegation of decisionmaking authority by the patient to the professional, not the fact of deleg ation. While som e patien ts want to ex plore every hypothesis, others wan t to know only the f inal r ecommendation; both ma y be ex ercising appropriate self- determ ination. Goals an d Realities II Decisionmaking Capacity and Voluntariness Effectiv e patient particip ation in health care d ecision making rests on three foundations that corre spond t o the traditionally accepte d elements of legally effectiv e informed cons ent: decisionmaking capacit y and vo luntariness, which are treated in this Chapter, and inform ation, which is discussed in Chapter Fou r. Throughout, the goals articu lated by the Co mmissi on are co mpared with the realities o f present practice, as evide nced by t he Commission's studie s and othe r empirical rep orts. Capacity to Make Particular Decisio ns For patients to participate effect ively in making decisions a bout their health ca re, they m ust possess the mental, em otional, and l egal capaci ty to do so. In the Commission's vi ew, deci sionmaking ca pacity is speci fic to a particular deci sion a nd depends not on a person's status (such as a ge) or on the decision reac hed, but on the person's act ual functioning in situ ations in which a decisio n about health care is to be made. Som e patients clearly possess such a capacity; others just a s clearly lack it. In obvious i nstances of dec isionmaking incapaci ty\u2014for exam ple, wi th infants and y children, the comatose, the sev erely mentally handi and the severel y mentally ill1\u2014the respon sibility of the health car e professional is to recognize th e incapacity an d to find another way to reach a decision that will adv ance the patient's goals an d interests. Su ch altern ative means of decisionmaking are discussed in Part Four of this Rep ort. 1 This Report does not address the distinc tive is sues posed by consent to mental health care or consent to health care by the mentally ill, whether or no t institut ionalized. 56 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapter 3 In other insta nces, a patient 's capacity to decide on a course of treatment will b e less clear-cu t. Professi onals may initially be uncertain of a particular patient's decisionmaking capaci ty. In s uch case s, the situation should be eval uated over time, as care providers assess the patient's understanding of i nformation an d reas oning a bout possible treatm ent. Efforts can also be made to enha nce the patient 's capacity by counseling, providing more information, m inimizing untoward effects of psychoactive drugs, and giving other formsof support. Ultimately, however, som eone m ust deci de whet her the patient is capabl e of m aking a particular decision that should then have binding force. Quest ions of capacity to make heal th care d ecisions m ay be rai sed from several perspective s. The law treats the issue under t he hea ding of \"com petence\" and generally pres umes that adults ca n make decisions fo r them selves unless they have been formally judged t o be i ncompetent.2 Consent gran ted by a co mpetent adu lt normally au thorizes a p ractitio ner to prov ide health care, whereas consent granted by an incompetent individual is usu ally n ot legally su fficien t to authorize pro fessionals to procee d. Sim ilarly, a com petent indivi dual's refusal of treatm ent as a rule has legal e ffect and m ust be res pected,3 but the refusal of a treatm ent by an incompetent patient lacks such legal effect (alth ough it may be taken i nto account i n decidi ng how to procee d). The l egal tests and st andards governing determinations of incom petence are discussed elsewh ere in this Repo rt,4 and a re not the primary conce rn here. Rather, the object ive is to e xplain why the patien t's cap acity to make health care d ecisio ns is im portant to a sou nd decision, and to investigat e the fo undations o f that deci sionmaking capacity.5 Impor tance of Capacity. The doctri ne of inform ed conse nt is founded on the prem ise that self-determination ought not be blind. That is, p atients' interests an d well- being a re best served when patients understand their medical situation a nd participate in deci ding on treatm ent or care. T his premise is to som e degree an em pirical proposition and to so me degree a st atemen t of faith . Insofar as the premise is an e mpirical one , there a re clea rly patients to whom it does not apply. That is to say, som e patients (fo r a vari ety of rea sons) are simply unable to make decisio ns that will ad vance their o wn interests. Following the directiv es of such patients can b e seriou sly 2 See, e.g., Lotman v. Security Mutual Life In s. Co., 478 F.2d 868 (3d Cir. 1973). 3 See, e.g., In re Brooks' Estate, 32 Ill. 2d 361, 2 05 N.E.2d 435 erms and \" incapacity\" are bei ng us ed in this discussion to av oid the sometimes conf ounding legal overton es associated wit h the term s competence and incompetence. Capacity and Voluntariness 57 injurious to their well-b eing and may fail to resp ect th eir own long-term values and objectives. By not applying informed con sent norms to patients who are incapable of jo ining with professionals to decide on their health care, society seeks to enhance t heir well-being by protecting them from substan tial h arms (or loss of benefits) t hat cou ld result fro m seriou s defects in their decision making abilities. Th e Co mmission believes that most peopl e would desire such protection if they lost their capaci ty to participate effectively in medical decisionmaking, an d concl udes t hat such societal protection of the well-be ing of its m embers is, in principle, appropriate. Society's protection d oes, h owever, im pose certain cos ts\u2014costs that b ecome particularly clear wh en th e actio n resu lts in the countermanding or disregard o f the expres sed prefe rences of a patient deem ed to lack capa city to make a pa rticular decision. At least to some degree, su ch protection infri nges on the patient's ab ility to determine his or her o wn fate. Thus , a co nclusion a bout a pat ient's decisionmaking capacity n ecessarily reflects a b alancing of two important, so metimes competing objectiv es: to enhance th e patient's well-b eing and to respect the person as a sel f-determining i ndividual. Commentators have sometimes failed to rec ognize element, viewi ng \"capacity\" or \"com intrinsic meaning a part from consi deration of particular circumstances or situations. Although this view m ay be appropriate in some instances (with, for example, the comatose or infants and small ch ildren), the Commiss ion believes it is in adequate in more ambiguous or troublesome instances . The Commission concludes, therefore, th at determinations of incapacit y to participat e in m edical decisionmaking s hould reflect the bal ance of possibly com peting interests. Elements of Capaci ty. In the view of the C ommis sion, a ny determination of t he capacity to deci de on a cour se of t reatment must relate to the individual ab ilities of a patient, the requirements of the task at hand, and the consequences lik ely to flow from the decision. Deci sionmaking capaci ty requires, t o greater or l esser deg ree: (1) possessi on of a set of val ues and goals6; (2) th e ability to communicate and to understan d inform ation; and (3) the ab ility to reason and to deliberate about one's choices.

Stand ards for Assessin g Cap acity. The actual measure ment of these v arious abilities is b y no means sim ple. Virtu ally all co nscious adults can pe rform som e tasks but not others.13In the co ntext of inform ed cons ent, what is critical is a p atient's cap acity to make a specific m edical decision. An asse ssment of an individual's cap acity must consi der the nat ure of the particular deci sionmaking process in light of t hese d evelopments: Do es th e patient possess t he ab ility to understand the relev ant facts and altern atives? Is th e patient wei ghing the decision with in a framework of values and goals ? Is the patient a ble to reason and deliberate abo ut this informatio n? Can the patient give reaso ns for the deci sion, i n light of the facts, th e altern atives, an d the impact of the decision on the patient's own goal s and val ues? To be sure, a patien t may possess th ese ab ilities b ut fail to exercise them well; that is, th e decisio n may be the resu lt of a mistak en understanding of the fact s or a defect ive reas oning process. In such instances, th e obligation of the pro fessional is not to decl are, on the basis of a \" wrong\" decision, t hat the patie nt lac ks decisionm aking ca pacity, but rat her to work with the patie nt toward a fuller and more accurat e understanding of the facts and a sound reasoning process . How de ficient must a decis ionmaking process b e to justify th e assessm ent that a patient lacks th e cap acity to make a p articular decision ? Since the assess ment must balance possibl y com peting consideration s of well-b eing and self-d etermin ation, the prudent course is to take into acco unt the potential co nsequ ences of the patient's decision. Whe n the c onsequences for well- being are sub stantial, th ere is a greater need to be certain that th e patient possesses th e necessary lev el of cap acity. When little tu rns on the decision , th e lev el of decisionmaking ca pacity required may be app ropriately reduce d (even though the constitu ent elem ents remain the same) and less scru tiny may be required about whether the pat ient possesses eve n the reduce d level of capaci ty. Thus a pa rticular patient may be capabl e of deciding about a relativ ely in consequential m edicatio n, but not abou t the am putation of a gangrenou s lim b. 13 Bern ard Gert and Charles Culver, What Would It Mean to Be Competen t Enough to Con sent to or Refu se Part icipation in Research? \u2014Philosophica l Over Na ed., Compe tency and Infor med Co nsent: Pap ers and Other Materials Devel oped for the Workshop \"Empirical Res earch on Informed Consent with Subjects of Uncertain C ompetence,\" National Inst itutes of Mental Health (Jan. 12-13, 19 81). Capacity and Voluntariness 61 This fo rmulation has sign ificantimplicati ons. First, it den ies th at simply by expressi ng a prefere nce a bout a treatm ent decision a n individual demonstrates the capaci ty to make t hat deci sion. The \"expresse d pre ference\" standard does nothi to precl ude the prese nce of a seri ous def ect or mistake i n a pat ient's rea soning process. Consequently, it can not ensure that the patient's expres sed preference accords with the patient's conception of future well- being. A lthou gh it gives what appears to be great deference to self-determination, t he expresse d preference standa rd m ay actually fail to promote the values underlying se lf-det ermination, which include t he ach ievement of personal val ues and goals. For these reasons, the C ommission re jects the expresse d preference standard for decisions that m ight com promise the patient's well-b eing.14 The Comm ission als o rejects as th e standa rd of capacity any tes t that looks solely to the content of the patient's decision. Any stand ard based on \"objectively correct\" decisions would allow a health professional (or other third part y) to declare t hat a patient lacks decisionm aking capacity whe never a decision appe ars \"wrong,\" \"irratio nal,\" o r otherwise in compatible with the evaluato r's view of what is best for the patient. Use of such a standard is in sh arp con flict with most of the values th at supp ort self-d etermin ation: it wo uld take the decision away from the patient an d place it with anot her, and it woul d inadequately reflect th e subjectiv e nature of each i ndividual's conce ption of what's good . Further, its im precision opens the door to manipulation of heal th care decisionmaking through selectiv e app licatio n. Logically, just as a patient's disagreem ent with a heal th care professional's recomm endation does not prove a lac k of decisionm aking capacity, co ncurrencewith the reco mmendatio n would not estab lish the patien t's cap acity. Yet, as test imony before the Commission m ade cl ear, cohe rent adults are sel dom said to lack capacity (except, perha ps, in the mental health context) wh en th ey acquiesce in the cours e ent their phy sicians. (Challeng es to patients' cap acity are rarer still wh en family members expressly concur in th e decision .) Th is divergence between theory an d reality is l ess sig nifican t than it might appea r, however, si nce neither th e self-d eterm ination nor the well- being of a pat ient would usually be adva nced by insisting upon an inquiry into the patient's decisionm aking capacity (or lack there of) whe n patient, physician, a nd family all agree on a c ourse of 14 Of course, ex treme care must be exer cised lest pronouncemen ts of \"what the patient rea lly wants \" becom e a cover for \"what I think is best for the pati ent.\" Properly circumscribed, howev er, a choice mad e on behalf of a patient who l acks capacity may be a truer example of one fundamental interest und ergirding self- determ ination than fol lowing th e patient's be. 62 Making Health Car e Decisions: Ch apter 3 treatm ent. Even i f the cou rse bei ng adopted might not, in fact, best match the pat ient's long-term view of his or he r own welfare, a decl aration of lack of cap acity will lead to a sub stitute making a decision for th e patient (which means full self-d eterm ination will not occur), yet will rarely result in a di fferent he alth care d ecision being m ade (w hich m eans no change in well-being). Substitution of a third party for an acquiescent patien t will le ad to a differen t outcome only if the new decision maker has a st rong com mitment to promoting pr eviously expressed val ues of the patient that differ si gnifican tly fro mthose that gu ided the physician . If, as wou ld usually be the case, th e sub stitute wo uld be a family member or ot her individual who would def er to the physician's rec ommendation, there would be little reason to initiate an inq uiry into capacity. Th e existing practice th us seem s gen erally satisfacto ry.15 Questions of patien t capacity in decisionmaking typically arise on ly when a patient c hooses a course\u2014often a refusal of treatment\u2014other than the one the health profe ssional finds m ost re asonable.16 A practitio ner's belief th at a d ecisio n is no t \"reason able\" is the b eginning\u2014 not the end\u2014of an inq uiry into the patient's acity to decide. If ev ery patient deci sion that a heal th professi onal disagree d with were grounds for a d eclaration of lack of cap acity, self-d etermination wou ld have little meaning. Even when disagreement occurs, a n assessm ent of the patient's decisionmaking capaci ty th of such capaci ty. Nonetheless, a seri ous disagreement about a deci sion with substantial conseque nces for the patient's welfare m ay appropriately trigger a m ore careful eval uation. Whe n that pr ocess indicates that the patien t understand s the situ ation and is cap able of reason ing soun dly about it, the patient 's choice s hould be acce pted. When it does not, furt her evaluation may be requi red, and i n som e instances a de termination o f lack of cap acity will b e appropriate.17 15 Plain ly, this conclusion r ests on prac tical and p rudenti al, de aluation their capacity . Those showing ps ychiatric mo rbidi ty that might u nderm ine th eir decisionmaking capacity could then be ch anneled through an alternative process designed to protect their in terests and well-being .

The factors that prompt an inquir y abou t a patient's capacity are related, but not Capacity and Voluntariness 63 Voluntarines s in Decision making A secon d requirement for informed consent is th at th e patient's particip ation in the decision making pro cess and ultimate d ecisio n regarding care must be vol untary. A choice t hat has been coerced, or that resulted from seriou s manipulation of a person's ab ility to make an intellig ent and in formed decisio n, is not the person's own free cho ice. This has l ong been recognized i n law: a consent force d by t hreats or induced by fraud or m isrepresent ation is legally viewed as no c onsent at all.18 Fro m the perspectiv e of ethics, a co nsent that is sub stantially involuntary does not provi de m oral aut horiz ation for treat ment because i t does not respect the pat ient's dignity and m ay not reflect the aims of the patient. Of co urse, t he facts o f disease and the limited cap abilities o f medicine often co nstrict th e choices availab le to patient and physician alike. In th at sen se, the cond ition of illness itself is so metimes sp oken of as \"coerci ve\" or involunt ary. But the fact that no available altern ative may b e desirable in itself, an d that the preferred course i s, at best, only the least bad among a ba d lot, does not render a choice coerced in the sense em ployed here. No change in human beh avior or in stitutional structure co uld rem ove this limita tion. Such co nstrain ts are merely facts of life that should not be rega rded as making a patient's ch oice involuntary.

The ex pectation on the part of profession als is that patients, once in su ch a settin g, will sim ply go along with such routine car e. Howev er, the Co mmissio n's study o f treatm ent refusals fou nd that in a ho spital settin g it was th e routine tests th at were most likely to be refu sed. At least so me p atients expected that participation was voluntary and refused tests and medications ordered without their kn owledg e until ad equate inform ation was prov ided abou t the nat ure, purpose, an d risks of these undertakings. Lac k of information in suc h cases may not only preclude vo luntary p articip ation but also raise questions about a p atient's rat ionality, and hence co mpetence. When a situ ation offers th e patient an opportunity to refu se care, then patient com pliance or acquies cence may be viewe d as im plicit consent. B ut when the tacit comm unication acc ompany ing such care is that there is no c hoice for the pa tient to m ake, and com pliance i s expecte d and enforce d (at least in the absence of vigorous objections), the treatm ent can be prope rly term ed \"forced.\" The following conversation between a nu rse and a pat ient rega rding postoperative care, obtained in one observation al stud ies, illu strates forced t that follows rout inely from anot her de cision (s urgery) that was made vol untarily. Nurse: Did they mention anything about a tube through your nose? Patient: Yes, I'm gonna have a t ube in my nose. Nurse: You're going to have the tube down for a couple of days or longer. It depe nds. So you're going to be NPO, nothing by mouth, and also you're going to have IV fluid . 20 Of course, not all forced interv entions that emp loy medical procedures in such institut ions are necessaril y intended to prom ote the we ll-being of others. Drawing the lin e between the pr otection of other s and th e abuse of inmates is a difficu lt task. See, e.g ., Rogers v . Okin, 778 F. Supp. 1342 (D. Mass. 1979). Capacity and Voluntariness 65 Patien t: I know. Fo r three or four days th ey to ld me that alread y. I don't lik e it, tho ugh. Nurse: You don't have any choice. Patient: Yes, I d on't have any choice, I know. Nurse: Like it o r not, yo u don 't hav e any cho ice. (laughter) After you c ome back, we'll ask y ou to do a lot of coughing and deep breathing to exercise y our lungs. Patien t: Oh, we'll see ho w I feel. Nurse: (Emphasi s) No matter how you feel, you have to do that!21 The interview ended a few min utes later with the patient still disputing whether he was go ing to cooperate with th e postoperative care. Coerce d Tre atment. Unlike fo rced treat ment, for which no consent is given, coe rced treatm ent procee ds on the basi s of a consent that was n ot freely given. As used i n this sense, a pat ient's deci sion is coerce d whe n the person bly threatened by another indi vidual, either exp licitly o r by imp with unwan ted and avo idable conseque nces unless the patient acced es to the specifie d course of action.22 Concern a bout c oercion is ac cordingly gre atest whe n a dispropo rtion in power or o ther sign ifican t inequality b etween a patient and ano ther ind ividual lend s credibility to the threat of harm and when the perceived interests of the individuals diverge.23 21 Lidz and Meisel, supra note 19 . 22 In this respect, threats should be distinguished from warning s of unpleasan t occurren ces that may be the natura l cons equences of certain decis ions. A physician's d iscussion of the n atural hi story of a d isease does not constitute threa ts, while a statem ent tha t a ph ysician wil l discharge the p atient from the hospital if the patient requ ests a sec ond opin ion (or asks too man y questions, o r complains ex cessively abou t hos pital food) prob ably does . In man y cases, th e distinction depends on whether the pr ofessional can bring abou t the unwante d consequences, b ut this is not alway s true. For exampl e, a surg eon who tells a breas t can cer pat ient of an inabi lity tocontinue in charge of her car e if s he rejects surger y in favor of chemotherap y or ra diation is probably not is suing a threat, although in some cir cumstances the sugge stion that a health prof essional woul d abandon a h ighly dependen t patient if medical advice wer e not f ollowed migh t constitut e an im proper and coercive threa t. 23 These conc erns are particu larly acute in c ertain as so-called to tal institut ions, wh ere whol e pop ulations are placed in a speci al cond ition of inequality and dependen cy on powerful other s, even for ord inary care and sustenance . Cho ices made in s uch settings are particularly subject to coercive influen ces, and careful scrut iny of their voluntar iness is often warr 66 Making Health Car e Decisions: Ch apter 3 The disparity in power between pati ent and heal th care profession al may b e sligh t or substan tial, d epending on the nature of the patien t's illn ess, th e institutional setting , the personalities o f the individuals involved, and several other fact ors. In nonemergency settin gs, a patient typically c an change practitio ners or si mply forego treatment, thus avo iding the p otential for coercion. Further, alth ough health care professionals do have in terests distinct from and som etimes in conflict with those of their p atients. Stro ng social and p rofessi onal norms usual ly ensure that priority is accorded to patients' welfare. To be sure, coercion can be exercised with benevolent motives if practitio ner and patient differ in their assessm ents of how th e patient's welfare is best serv ed. No netheless, th ere is litt le reaso n to believe that blatant form s of coe rcion are a proble m in mainstrea m Am erican health ca re. Whe n isolated instances of abuse do arise, th e law prov ides suitable remedies. A pat ient's family and ot her concer ned persons may oft en play a useful role in the deci sionmaking process. Som etimes, howe ver, they may try to coerce a pa rticular decisi on, either because of what they percei ve to be in the patient's best interests or beca use of a desire to adva nce t heir own interests. In s uch insta nces, si nce the health care profession al's first loyalty is to the patient, he or she should attempt to enhance th e patien t's ab ility to make a voluntary, uncoerced decision and to overc ome any coercive press ures.24 Manipulation. Blatan t coercio n may be of so little co ncern in professional-patient relationships because , as physicia ns so often proclaim , it is so easy for health professi onals to elicit a desired decision through more subtle m eans. Indeed, some physicians are critical of t he legal requ iremen t for in formed consent on th e grounds th at it must be mere win dow d ressing since \"patien ts will, if th ey tru st their d octor, accede to alm ost any request he cares to m ake.\"25On some occasions, to be su re, this result can be a chievedby rational persuasion, since t he profession al presu mably has good reasons for prefe rring a recomm ended course of acti on. Bu t the tone of su ch critics su ggests they h ave something else in mind: an ability to package and present the facts i n a way th at leav es th e patient with no real choi ce. S uch c onduct, capitalizin g on disparities i n kno wled ge, p osition, and in fluence, is manipulative in character an d impairs the vol untariness of the patient's choice.26 24 The role of the fam ily is discussed in m ore detail in Ch apter Five infra. 25 Henr y K.

As discussed i n Chapter Tw o, for self- determination to be m eaningful, patients must have some understanding of the altern atives an d wh at th ey en tail. Th e ob ligation of health care profession als, who typ ically will h ave a g reater co mman d of this information than patients, is to commu nicate th at in formation in an understand able fash ion. The Nature and Scope of Disclosur e Much confusion has a risen, both in legal contexts and in the medical and philosophic literatu re, over the nature an d scope of the information to be disclosed and discuss ed.4 Although the content and ext ent of the information to be discussed will inevitably depend on the circu mstances o f the particular case, the ethical standard for assessi ng the ade quacy of di scussion is constant. Professionals should discuss with patients the facts and ass ociate d uncertain ties t hat will g ive patients a work ing und erstand ing of their situation and of availab le treat ment altern atives, so they can participate effectiv ely in th e decision making process. Th is will include consideration of patients' values and objectives, as well as th eir ab ility an d desire to particip ate in th e decisionmaking process .

Professionals should recognize, and lawyers and cour ts shou ld perhaps be rem inded, t hat patients' interests are not well serv ed by detailed tech nical exposition s of facts th at are germane neither to patients' understand ing of their situ ation s nor to any decisio ns that must be made. Such recitatio ns are not legally required, nor should they be. Over whelming patients with a mass of unintelligible tech nical d ata that they are ill-p repared to comprehend or use, partic ularly at what m ay be a stre ssful time, can be a s destructive of the communication process a nd its goal of enhance d understanding as giving too little in form ation is. Si milarly, reciti ng \"all th e facts\" in a b lunt, insensitive fashion can also destroy the commu nicatio n process, as well as the pat ient-professional relationship itself.

This illu strates on e important counterproductive effect of the law's fo cus on the \"du ty to warn \" asp ect of informed consent. Recon ciling the requirement that all materi al facts b e disclosed with the ob jectiv e of facilitatin g an intellig ent discussion of the most salien t issues is clearly no simple tas k, either for th e law th at must form ulate di sclosure s tanda rds or f or practitio ners who must app ly those stand ards to the myriad individual circum stances that arise in medical pr actice. Nor is th e conflict b etween full disclosure and intellig ent discussion unique to the law of inform ed consent. Indeed, this co nflict rep resents an important limitat ion on the law as an instrum ent of s ocial control. In the Commis sion's surv ey, p rofessionals and t he public were as ked several questions about disclosure in general and about who is responsible for making su re pat ients are adeq uately inform ed. Nearl y all the public (97%) said that patients should have the right to all av ailable information about their con dition and treat ment that they wish . Somewhat su rprising ly (since patients repo rt that they wan t virtually all in formation), when aske d \"Who do you think is the best judge of the am ount of inform ation tha t should be disclosed to the patient?,\" 45% of the public said the patient and 44% said the physician. In addition, 56% of the public th ought that some patients should be told less ab out their treat ment than others.5Few pe ople (2%) co mplained that do ctors tell patients too m uch about either routine care or seri ous illn ess. Howev er, 38 % felt th at patients are to ld too little about routine care an d 33% felt th e sam e about seri ous illn ess.6 Physician s were ask ed: \"Ho w often do you find your self in a situ ation where you must make a consc ious and delibe rate eval uation of how m uch to tell a patient about his cond ition or treatmen t?\" Far fro said \"se tim es rarely,\" and 3% said \"never.\"7 In an open-ended 5 People in poor health, the elderly , and t hose with little educ ation or low in come were m ost likel y (up to 58%) to v iew the doc tor as the best judg e. People with a life- threatening illness, those in poor health, those over 35, those with high incom es, and college gr aduates were more lik ely (up to 65%) to feel that some people should have less inform ation than o thers. 6 Young people, women, people without a us ual source of medical care or health insurance, the colleg e-educated, and those with high incom es were m ore lik ely than others to feel th at doctors give t oo littl e inform ation about routi ne care and seri ous illness. Overa ll, 11 % of the public were unce rtain whe ther doctors give the right amount of in formation abou t serious illn ess. 7 Intern ists were m likel y and obstetri cians/g ynecolog ists least likel y to de liberate frequently about how much to tell a patien t. Among sp ecialists and s ub specialists, 9% reported they deliberate as The Communication Proces s 73 question, phy sicians were asked: \"What are the primary factors tha t influence how m uch you tell a p atient abou t his cond ility to d (56%) to cope with the information (31%), the serio usness of the condition (30%), and the patient's desire to know (25%) were t he rea sons given m ost frequently.8Time const raints were mentioned by only 2% of the sample. In term s of respon sibility, ph ysician s felt it is p rimarily th eir respon sibility t o make sure th at the patient is fu lly in formed (77%) rather than the patient's resp ation (3%), alth ough 19% said the doctor and patient are equally responsible. The public, on the other hand, esp ecially th ose in poo r health and with little ed ucatio n, generally placed m ore of a burde n of responsi bility on the patient (20%). In ge neral, however, th e public agreed with the physician s that it is th e latter's respon sibility to make sure patients are fully informed. Whe n asked whet her t heir phy sicians keep them inform ed abou t questions and decisions relating to their medical care that they (the publi c) consider im portant, 37% said they are in formed on all imp ortant issu es and another 30% said they a re inform ed on m ost issues.9 seldom as weekly and 11% r eported that they rarelyevalu ate the amount o f inform ation to disclose. Ph ysicians who are ho spital- based and thos e who tre at a high percen tage of patients with serious illness were m ore likel y than offic e-based physicians or th ose who treat fewer seriously ill patients to re port frequent conscious evalu ations . 8 Some significant variations were found within s ubgroups of ph ysicians con cerning the factors that influence how much inform ation is disclosed. Although the patien t's ability to understand was the factor most often cited by all physicians, those tre ating primarily poor patients were significantly mor e likely than those with few p oor patients (71% versus 52%) to mention patient understand ing. Foreign med ical graduates were most likely to mention serious ness of the patient's condition ( 37% versus only 14% of gradu ates of U.S. public medical schools with major research support). Foreig n medical gradu ates and physicians treating pr imarily poor patients were the least likely to m ention a pat ient's desire for inform ation as a fa ctor that influen ced disclosure (15% of foreign gradu ates compared with at least 25% of U .S. graduates, and 17% of those with a major ity of their patients being poor compar ed with 27% of physicians treating few poor p atients ). 9 People withou t a usual source of care felt least well inform ed. Those in po or health, the elder ly, the poor, no nwhites, those with no health insurance, and the poorly educated felt best informed, perh aps because their expect ations were lower. Those m ost satisfied with their doctor's willingn ess to answer qu estions about th eir condition and tr eatm ent were p eople who had had a life- threa tening illn ess, who usually got their medical car e in a doctor's office, or who wer e in poor health, elderly, female, white, or wi th little educ ation. These 74 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 4 What , then, are the substantive issues to be discussed by professional and patient ? These have been va riousl y form ulated by courts an d commentators, and one version has been incorporated in the federal regulations governing the con duct of research with human subj ects.10 In addition, recen t surveys have identified a number of elem ents as particularly important to patients.11Without seek ing to provide the last word on this much-discussed subject, t he Co mmissio n believes the core elements fall under three headings: (1) the patient's current medical status, including its lik ely co urse if no treatm ent is pursued; (2) the intervention(s) that might improve t he prognosis, including a description of the proce dure(s ) involve d, a c haracteriza tion likelihood a nd effect of associ ated ri sks and be nefits, and t he likely course (s) with and without therapy; and ( 3) a pr ofessional opinion, usu ally, as to the best altern ative. Furtherm ore, e ach of the se elements mustbe discussed in light of associated uncertain ties. Current Medi cal Status. Inaccurate or incomplete informatio n about illness li mits p atients' understan ding of th e effects and of wh at is at stak e in any effo rt to alter th e natural course of di seases. For patien ts to make effectiv e use of av ailab le info rmation, not only must it be understandable, but patients mu st recogn ize th e uncertain ties in herent in th e inform ation itself and in any effort t o prognosticate on the basi s of it. In the Co mmission's surv ey,56% of physician s said they always discuss t heir diagnosis and prognosis with the pat ient and anot her 42% s aid they usually do . Accord ing to the pub lic, 52 % of th eir physician s alway s explain th eir diagnosis and prognosis; 26% report their physician s usually do. The f requency with which this is done di ffered in the vari ous s ubgroups exam ined.12 In a different version of this question, given to half the sam ples,13 99% of physician s reported th ey initiate su ch same groups were most lik ely to report hi gh satisfaction with their doctor's hones ty in discussions. 10 U.S. Departm ent of Health an d Human Services, Protection o f Human Subjects, 46 Fed.

CARE 718 (198 1). 12 Those who had had a life- threatening illness, who had hi gh incomes, who received their care in a do ctor's offi ce, or w ho were young , female, white, in excellent health, or college- educated were signi ficantly more lik ely to report th at their ph ysicians alway s or usually explained such info rmation (for example, 87% of the college- educated versus 64% of those with less than a high school educatio n). Although almost none of the p hysicians re ported they rarely or never discus sed diagnosis and pr ognosis, up to 10% of the public with no usual source of car e, the elder ly, and the least wel l educated report ed that th eir physicians rarely or never discussed the se items. 13 Ques tions on specific items of information that could be disclos ed The C ommunication Process 75 discussi on as a matter of co urse, though only 75% of the public felt this was a professi onal obligation . Here, too , there were variatio ns by subgroups in the population, with more th an 80% of those with life-th reaten ing illness, the young, the college-educated, and pe ople in excellent health feeling tha t physician s should initiate d iscussion . Since info rmed consent has, in term s of legal requ irements, so metimes been equated wi th a duty to disclose acc ording to the standa rds of the medical co mmunity, i t is interesting to learn that on certain points physician s and the public are in substantial ag reem ent. For exam ple, 17% o f physicians claimed that all their patie nts want candid asse ssments of their diagnosis and p rognosis, even unfavorable on es, and an additional 69% percei ved that most of their p atients felt that way. Of the public, 94% reporte d that they would \"want to know everything.\" Indeed , the public displayed an unflinching desi re fo r fact s about their conditions, eve n dismal facts. When as ked s pecifically whet her they woul d wa nt to know about a diagnosis of cancer, 96% of the public said yes (with almost no va riation acros s subgroups). Whe n asked \"If you had a t ype of cancer t hat usually leads to d eath in less t han a y ear, would you w ant your doctor to give you a realistic estimate of how long you had to live, or would you prefer that he not tell you ?,\" 85% (again, with little v ariation) said th ey wou ld wan t a realistic esti mate. Whe n, however, physicians were as ked \"If you ha d a pa tient with a fully confirmed diagno sis of lung cancer in an advance d stage, which of t he following would you be most lik ely to tell yo ur patien t?,\" they sho wed much less willingne ss to be candid. Only 13% said the y would \" give a straight statistical prognosis for his class of disease\"; 33% said they woul d say th ey \"cou ldn't tell ho w long he might live, but would stress th at it cou ld be for a su bstantial period of time\"; 28% w ould say they \"coul dn't tell how long, but wou ld stress th at in most cas es people live no longer tha n a year\"; and 22% woul d \"refuse t o speculate on how long the patient mig ht live.\" Thus it wo uld still appear that p hysician s are m ore relu ctant to disclose a limited prognosis th an patients wou ld like. Nonetheless, t he Co mmission's survey indicates that physi cians ge nerally disclose inform ation abou t patients' diagnosis and prognosis, and that both physicians and t he public feel this should be were asked in two differen t ways in the Com mission's surve y (by splitting the samples of phy sicians and the public) in order to determine not only the frequen cy with which ph ysicians sa y they disclose certain information (and patien ts report such disclosures) but also wh ether ph ysicians initiate discussion about vario us pieces of inform ation as a matter of cours e or wait to be asked ( and whether patien ts think ph ysicians should initiate discussion). 76 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 4 done. T hese r esults are co nsistent with findings from other su rveys that have demonstrated a rece nt trend t oward more com plete and f rank disclosure and even toward more ope n discussi on specifically regardi ng \"bad ne ws,\"14 Professi onal's Rec ommenda tion. In order for medical intervention to be wa rranted,the pat ient must stand t o gain more from so me intervention than if none were under taken at all. As noted previously, the benefit to be gained must be assesse d in terms of t he patien t's own values and goals. Thu s, a practitio ner should be cautious not to rule ou t prematurely an altern ative that might offer what a p articula r patien t wou ld perceive as a b enefit ev en if the practitio ner sees it diffe rently. The patient's condition an d the range of av ailab le altern atives will necessa rily shape the course of th ediscussion . In some instances, th ere may be only one medically recognized tr eatment, so t hat the decisi on is primarily between t hat treat ment and no treatm ent at all. In s uch case s, discussion will n aturally fo cus o n the benefits an d risks asso ciated with that treatm ent compare d with the likely course of the un treate d disease. Tim e is an important dimension he re: can an i ntervention be put off, and with what consequ ences, to allo w fo r greater d iagnostic certain ty an d to permit the patient to reflect o n the decisio n and to engage in any desired activ ities with which the intervention might interfere ? More comm only, there wil l be a range of m edically acceptable responses to a given disease or heal th condition. The decision then has t wo compone nts: whether to treat an d how to treat. Here the d iscussion will typically req uire a co mparison of several treat ment options and an airing of the preferences of both professional and patient. Since th e judg ment about which choice will b est serve well- being properly b elongs to the patient, a ph ysician is ob liged to mention all altern ative treatments, including those he or she does no t provide or favor, so long as t hey are s upporte d by re spectable medical opini on. For example, an internist has an ob ligation to discuss a surg ical op tion with a patient who might benefit fro m it. In any case, th e physician wou ld ideally o ffer to refer the patient to a ph ysician who do es offer or favor t he alternative treatm ent. 14 For example, a survey condu cted in 1961 found that 90% of p hysicians preferr ed not to inform patients of a diagn osis of can cer.

Rosoff, INFORMED CONSEN T: A GUIDE F OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, Aspen Public ations, Rockville, Md (1981) at 34 0- 76. The C ommunication Process 77 Similarly, a physician ought no t withho ld inform ation abo ut a treatm ent from a patient simply beca use t he physician judges its potential benefits no t to be worth its co sts.15Increasingly, however, eve n when physician s fulfill th eir o bligation to describe altern atives, th e exp ense of some alternatives m ay make them unavai lable to most patients. Ordinarily, altern atives sho uld still b e described, ev en though they wou ld not be cove red by a patient's insurance plan (if any) or enro llment agreem ent with a heal th maintenance organization, l est the patient be deprived of the opportunity to seek other avenues for paying for the treatment or to look for treatm ent outside the insured or prepaid options. Plainly, the special rules and exp ectations gene rated for the patient- professional relationshi p by the legal and ethical prece pts sum marized i n the requ irement of i nformed consent find no precise equ in commercial relatio in the in suran ce m arketplace. Non etheless, because of t he close c onnection betw een health insurance (incl uding prepaid group plans) and health care, both the seller s and the bu yers of such insurance should m ake sure buyers receive a com prehensible explanation of the limitatio ns in what th ey are p urchasing. Otherwise, their sub sequent decision s at the ti me of selectin g among treat ment altern atives m ay not in any real sense be ei ther voluntary or informed. The Comm ission does not believe that each alternat ive m ust be discuss ed in c omprehensive detail. Ra ther, the profes sional shoul d initially set forth, in a fairly g eneral way, th e nature and implications of the various options. Such a discussion can and should be used to \"sound out\" what is important to the patient and to identify th e options likely to prove most satisfacto ry in lig ht of the patient's val ues and prefe rences. Once the options (includin g the possibility o f no treat ment) have been pared down to those t hat seem most prom ising to patient and professional, a more det ailed evaluation of the risks a nd bene fits is appr opriate. At tention should be devoted as well to the tim e dimension and finality o f the choice, and to the possibility o f a seq uential appro ach to various altern atives. In this process, the Commission vi ews the discussion of risks and benefits as a st ep toward a sound deci sion among al ternatives, not a supreme objective in itself. This Report, like many discussi ons of inform ed cons ent, places considerable stress on the patien t's right of self-determination, including the right to choose among available treatments or to reject a particular treatment. Yet the Commission 15 Nothing in the obliga tions th at arise or co llectively, from taking steps to m ake the health car e system more effici ent, includ ing the e limination of tre atment options tha t do not produ ce a favorab le cost-b enefit ratio in particul ar cases. 78 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 4 does not mean to suggest th at profession als must tak e a neutral po sition among avai lable al ternatives. mendat to pat ients, a nd m any pat ients would be quite disconcerted if th ey were quested a \"doctor's opinion.\" Inde ed, a critical aspect of the profession al's role is to provide expe rt advice and judgment, and not solely techni cal diagnostic or curative skills. Bu t the reco mmendation shou ld neither be, nor ap pear to b e, coercive; rat her, it sh ould function both as a yard stick against which patients can measure t heir own inclinations and a s a st imulus to further questioning a nd discussion if the rec ommendation is not one t he pat ient agrees with.16 Trea tment info rmation in practice. The public clearl y feels tha t physicians shou ld discuss t he nature, ri sks, and other conseque nces of the recom mended treatm ent. Although physicians gene rally report that they do so, the Comm ission's s urvey found t hat patients are less li kely to perceive that this information is general ly disclosed by their phy sicians (see Tabl e 1). The greatest disp arity w as found on the qu estion of discussion of costs associated with treatm ent. Whe reas 70 % of the public th ought physician s should initiate such discussion s, only 38% of doctors reported that they do so. Whe n the expe nse of treatment is born e by the pat ient\u2014and a s ubstan- tial amount of expe nse is borne by the patient, eve n when he or she is insured\u2014di fferences in t he cost of alte rnatives can be as im portant to t he patient's \" pursuit of a life pl an\" as differences in risks or side e ffects . A number of proposals are c urrently being considered that would increase the amount of cost-sharing by patients; this would make cost information 16 In m aking tr eatment re commendations the h ealth car e professi onal m ay indicate what his or her own values are. To the extent t hat a parti cular recom mendation is based on the pr ofessional's values, rather than the p atient's values, th at should be made cle ar. For exam ple, a physician m ay reco mmend that an athl ete r etire fro m competition because it is harming his or h er health. The athl ete, however, may want to rem ain in professional com petition as long as possible. The p hysician m ay reply that the patient's view is shortsig hted and that health is more im portant than anot her year of professional sports. Once hav ing stated the r ecommendation, however , and having made clear th e values that led the ph ysician to th e recommendation, the choic e remains the p atient's. When th ere are a number of medically appropriate treatment alterna tives, the decisio n among them may also turn on valu e pref erences. For example, a physician who f eels strongly that kidney transplant is pr eferable to renal d ialysis is likel y to be stating a va lue pr eference rath er th an a pure ly medical conclusion . In such situations, p hysician s should recommend that the patient consult with anoth er expert with oppos ite views be fore making a final decision . In bo th examples, clarif ication of the professiona l's values is lik ely to provoke a usef ul discussion of the patient's valu es. See, e.g., Robe rt M. Veatch, Generalizatio n of Expertise, 1 TH E HASTINGS CENTER STUDI ES 29 (1973) . The C ommunication Process 79 even m ore important. E ven when the pati ent does not bear the expe nse directly, providing cost information w ould perm it the pat ient to consi der whet her the personal be nefit seem s comme nsurate with t he cost to societ y. (Although this may not caus e a pat ient to alter his or her beha vior, at least the person will h ave some idea of why insuran ce premiums are so high.) Furtherm ore, a lthough discussion of cost s may, in the short run, be embarrassi ng to patients and physicians, in the long run 80 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 4 failure to discuss e xpenses could compromise heal th\u2014a pat ient who is reluctant to e xplain that a prescribe d medicine is unaffordable may fail to fill th e prescri ption; an ind ividual who fears t hat an exp ensive operation will be rec ommended m ay deci de not to go to a specialist whe n referred to one. In the view o f the Commission, health care p rofession als hav e an obligation to ensure th at patients get the co st info rmatio n that is relev ant to the treatm ent options under consideration. The observational studies c onducted by t he Commission a re most striking in their find ings that in hospital settin gs often little o r nothing is actually d iscussed with patients reg arding com monly make deci sions and proceed to treat the pat ient. Beyond this general ization, however, there was t remendo us va riation in the nat ure of disclosure an d deci sionmaking that was related to the structure of th e medical care setting, the nature of the patient's illn ess, an d the treat ment under con sideratio n. In the study of treatm ent refusals in m edical, surgical, a nd specialt y wards of a university teaching hospital and a comm unity hospital, it was found that most of t he treatment refusals were related to the nature and extent of informatio n prov ided to patie nts. In m any cases there was a total lack of i nformation conce rning diagnostic and t herapeutic proced ures. Typically th ese were ordered b y physician s without patients being alerted to what was t o be done, m uch less bei ng as ked. Al though most peopl e went along with these tests and proced ures, the lack of inform ation serve d as a trigge r for refusals by patients already primed to resist tre atment becaus e of ambivalence about the primary procedur e fo r which th ey h ad bee n hospitalized, delays, previous com plications, et c. It was n ot always obvious to patients wh y something needed t o be do ne an d som e refused to proceed until th ey were g iven some justificatio n. Th us this lack of in form ation was often a precipitating fact or, but not generally the sole cause of refusals. In some cases, pat ients were t old that a test or procedure would be performed, but they were not informed abo ut the purpose or t he risks. Pat ients who knew or discovered that certain procedures we re potentially very risky refused treat ment until reason able justificatio n and assuran ces were provided. Another source o f refusals of treatm ent was co nflictin g inform ation given to patients by different heal th care professionals. This is es pecially likely to occur in hospitals, whe re pat ient care i s divided among di fferent people, many of whom are not in direct communication wi th each other. This resulted in patient uncertainty about who was m aking deci sions about their care and whom , therefore , they sh ould trust. In some cases p atients questioned the capabilities of the hou se officers The C ommunication Process 81 and wanted their own primary p hysician's endorsem ent before agreeing t o a procedure. Some refusal s could be traced to a lack of communication on the part of both the doctor and the pat ient. For exam ple, one pat ient refused to take a routinely presc ribed laxative because she had severe diarrhea . The docto r had failed to ask the patient about her bowels and the patient was hesitant to volunteer th e relev ant information. Once th e patient to ld the nurse responsible for dispensing medications why she di d not want the laxative (which she had previously been taking despite her diarrhea), the medication was with drawn. In the Commission's ot her obse rvational study, the nature of the communication an d deci sionmaking p rocess vari ed for cardi ology versus surgery patients, for outpatients versus inpatients, and for acute versus chronic dis orders. Differe nces in the nature of disclo sures for surgery and cardi ology patients derived from differe nces in the authority structures and daily rou tines in the two ward s and from the nature of the interventions themselves. Su rgery is a sin gle ev ent that is relativ ely easi ly describ ed by staff and und erstood by patients. On the surgical w ard, a sin gle, readily identifiab le physician was usu ally clearly i n charge. Patien ts had a greater opportunity to ask questio ns than i n cases where responsibility was mo re diffuse. Cardiology is organized ar ound an o rgan malfunction, not around a particular treatment. Cardiac care i s therefore m ore process-o riented and ambiguous and may involve num erous forms of t reatm ent and diagnostic tests. The nature of disclosures for cardiology patients varied with the procedure. For exam ple, pat ients undergoing exerci se stress tests (who were usually o utpatients referred to the hospital just fo r this procedure) were mailed a cov er letter and consen t form describ ing the test. Up on arrival at the hospital the nurse as ked i f they had read t he form and had any quest ions. If they had no questions (which was usually the case), no discussion took place. Presum ably the refe rring physic ians had disc test som ewhat with the patients p reviously, but those encounters were not observed. Cardiac catheterization pat ients, on the ot her han d, got det ailed explanation s of th e procedure an d its risk s. Th e following is a tran scrip t of part of a typical conve rsation bet ween one phy sician an d patient. Havi ng explained why the proce dure should be d one and w hat information it wou ld provide, t he physician we nt on t o describe how it was d one a nd what it would feel like, including that the pat ient would feel very hot for about 20 seconds . Patien t: Oh, seco nds only, th at's all right. Bu t I do wan t this expla nation because I knew I would get this for 25 years. I guess I've heard a lot of 82 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 4 things about it. Friend s of mine have had it an d so forth. Yes, so me people lik e it an d some people say it's th e worse thi ng that happened t o them in their lives. I think I ought to tell yo u that there's so me possibility that we m ay have t o do a transeptum catheteri zation [and he explained what this consisted of]. The re's some potential risk s. I t hink yo u will find th ey are terrifying , but I wan t you to remember we weigh the risks b oth of doing it and not doing it before we recommend it to you. Mayb e you shouldn't tell m e until tomorrow. Well, I cou ld wait u ntil to morrow, but I do have to tell yo u this. I want you to know the risk is lo w. We are talking a bout a one in a thousand chance of a major risk. There's s ome minor ones, too. But they can all be dealt with. Som e of the major ones ca n, too, but they're no t very likely. Here are some of them. First o f all we h ave to g o into the vessel, an d we can inju re th e vessel, an d that can sometimes require surg ery, wh ich can be difficu lt in its o wn right. The se cond one is that you m ight have harde ning of t he arte ries already, a nd some sort of blockage could result from pushing through them. This can requ ire su rgery also to make it better, an d even s o there 's a low risk of a hea rt attack or o f stroke from it. Then another thing is that some peopl e are allerg ic to th e dye, an d this can put somebody into sho ck, an d usually we can treat t hat with medicine, but it's q uite seriou s. Another thin g it can do is it can cause an irregu lar heartbeat, and you can even nee d an electric shoc k because it can c ause you r heart to stop. But of course you would be asl eep t hen, and you wou ldn't feel it. Ano ther thing is th at if we need t o do the transe ptal catheterization, that ca n cause a p uncture of t he hea rt and bleeding. The bl ood can get betwee n the heart and the sac around it, an d then we woul d have to drain that. One of the m inor risks is that you can have a hematoma around where we put in the catheter. Tha t's not m uch of a real problem, but you ca n get black a nd blue, and that happe ns because of t he Hepa rin we put in t o prevent the clo tting I talk ed about t: You know, I can't remember any of that stuff . Doct or: Well, I kn ow it's scary , but I want you to understand that it's my feelin g that it is a higher risk not to have it done. B ut of course ultimately it's your d ecision, not mine. Patien t: Do you do this often ? Doctor: Yeah, th is is a big center for th at so rt of th ing, for valve replacem ents, and we see a lot of these. Patien t: You see it's all new to m e. Doct or: Andone other thing is that you're going to have to sign a con sent form. The nurse'll bring that in later ton ight. Patien t: Well, you have to do it because it's th e best procedure. Several th ings are worth notin g in th is ex change. The patient was clearly a mbivalent abo ut learn ing all th e details ab out risk s; the doctor was clearly determined to e numerate the m and t ried to be reass uring. Given the sheer vol ume of information pr ovided, cou pled wi th the anxiety that probably pervaded th e entire situ ation, it is not surprising th at the patient stated imm ediately that he coul d not \"rem ember any of that stuff\" (though other patients following similar d isclosures had actu ally b een able to remember a go od deal). The patient was m ore conc erned a bout whet her the procedure would hurt and a bout the physician's e xperience with it than in knowing details abo ut the risk s. It was th e patient who pointed ou t a key aspect in m ost of m edical care, nam ely that these th ings may b e routine for the staff bu t they are n ew to the patient. The ultimate decisio n to go ahead with the test was b ased on the patient's a ssessm ent that it was t he best procedure and that it was necessary . The stud ies furth er indicated th at the extent o f disclosure was related both to th e nature of th e propo sed treatm ent and to th e risks invo lved. For courses of acti form ation was provided, particularly when the proced ure was rec ognized to be a ri sky one. For more routine courses of action, not perceived as formal proced ures, less information w as provided. This was t rue ev en in the case of administration of potentially risk y drugs, which might entail g reater risks than minor surgical procedures for which more information was d isclosed. T hese practices m ay reflect the origins of consen t requ iremen ts in surgical practice .17 17 Only a few jurisdictions have ever c onsid ered the appl icabililty of in formed consent to medications, see, e .g., Hamilton v. Hard y, 549 P.2d 1099 (Colo. App. 1976); Sharpe v. Pugh, 270 N.C. 598, 155 S.E.2d 84 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 4 In gene ral it was f ound that sur gical out patients received l ess unprompted information than inpatients. On t he other hand, they asked more questions an d sought other sources of inform ation, so that ultimately they m ay have end ed up gettin g as m uch inform ation as tho se in th e hospital. The nature of the dis order was found t o affect the am ount of inform ation patients receive fro m physicians about treatm ents. Chronically ill p atients are sometimes so well educated a bout their illn ess t hat th ey sp eak in the same jargon as the medical personnel. Their understanding of information relev ant to their illn ess and t reatment grows over time. The increase i n both inform ing an d understand ing th at ti me al lows is most appare nt in the case of chronic illness. Furtherm ore, i t was fo und that much of t he information gi ven t o patien ts is n ot necessarily in tended to assist th em in particip ating in the decisionmaking pr ocess , though it sometimes 108 (1967); Marsh v. Arnold, 446 S.W.2d 949 (Tex. Civ . App. 1969), and none of them has ever ex plicitly rejected the appli cability. In fact , one m uch-discussed rece nt case, Truman v . Thomas, 165 C al. Rptr. 308, 27 Cal.3d 285, 61 1 P.2d 902 (198 0), held th at an inf ormed consent claim c ould be founded on a p hysician's f ailure to disclose the risks of not performing a proced ure. One case holds that infor med consent requir ements do not ap ply to th e dispensation of medications. In Mallo y v. Shanahan, 421 A.2d 803 (Pa. Super. 1980), in an opinion that did not includ e an explan ation of the court's reaso ning, the Penns ylvania Superior Court held that the administration of a drug, not involving an y physical tou ching o f the patient, co uld not constitute a batter y and thus was out side the s cope of th e state's inform ed consent r equirements. Th e Penns ylvania approach is undes irable in that it substantially undercuts the goals of patie nt well-being and self -determination that informed consen t is in tended to serve. Si nce so much medical care involv es the use of drugs, man y of which hav e potentially serious or ev en lethal side eff ects, informed consen t requ iremen ts should be app licable. The C ommunication Process 85 has t hat consequence. People who are newl y diagnosed as havi ng a ch ronic disease a re given a great deal of inform ation to help th em adju st to a new way o f life an d comply with the treatment recom mendat ions of t he attending medical pers onnel. Ideally, info rmatio n shou ld helppatients to cope with th eir illn esses and sh ould produce bet ter outcomes. It is thus a part of g ood care and goes beyon d merely tryin g to improve compliance. Ho wever, it was fo und that patients sufferin g from an acute illn ess typ ically are g iven on ly enoug h information so th ey can agree to the therapeutic reco mmen dation of the medical p ersonn el an d so they will no t be too surprised by untoward results. Accord ing to the nurses i n the ob servation al study of informed consent, this is the main purpose of preope rative s urgery education.18 Thus it woul d appear t hat in actual practice the nat ure and exte nt of information pr ovided t o patients regarding treatment alternatives, including the rec ommended t reatment, risks, benefits, and other consequences , varies substan tially d epending on the nature of the p atient's cond ition and of the propose d treat ment as well as on the prefe rences of the patie nt an d providers. The Role of Uncer tainty. Underlyin g all th ree co re elemen ts of the professional-patient com munication process is the dimension of uncertainty. Few would claim that medicine i s an exact science, yet m any comm entators have remarked on the disinclination of medical professionals to discuss with their p atients the un certai nties in Exp lanatio ns of is attitu de rang e from an insisten ce on maintaining profession al control and d ominance to the po tential thera peutic efficacy of unque stioning c onfidence treatment by patien t and pr ofessional alike.19 (General recognition of this effect is implicit in the nearly 18 Certainly not all nurses would agree that the g oals of preopera tive edu cation ar e so lim ited.

The C ommission's view of informed consent includes as o ne facet p atients being able to reflect th eir own attitu des toward uncertain ty in their decisio ns. If th ey do not know o f uncertain ties in the diagno sis an d treatmen t, their ab ility to be self- determining is limited . Types of uncerta inty. Uncertainties about medical deci sions derive from a nu mber of s ources , som e more intractable than others. First, of course, there are lim itations in medical knowledge. While biomedical research continually pu shes forward the frontiers o f knowledg e, much remains onl y imperfect ly understood. Second, there is what m ay be term ed \"em pirical uncertainty\": that uncertain ty in herent in any knowledge ob tained through the scien tific method. The reliability of inform ation based on past e xperie nce with a defined, sim ilar group of pat ients depe nds upon the det ermined err or of statistical prediction, the ade quacy of defi nition of t he group, the acc uracy of observations, and the constancy of natural history and medical care o ver time. A pa rticularly difficult uncertainty for both doctors and patients derives fro m the probabilistic n ature of mu ch health care. Mo st treat ment recom mendat ions are base d on the physician's view of what is m ost likely to be success ful rat her tha n on absol ute certainty that a particular treat ment will lead to a particular outcome. Implicit is some notion of probability\u2014 90% of the time this is succes sful. Yet most people, physici ans and patients alike, see th e resu lts of diagnostic tests as c ompletely relia ble, ev en though they know tha t no test is 1 00% accu rate. Patients especially may dra w broad and unwarranted i nferences from a similar case they know of, act ing as if a n example we re proof.20 Uncertain ty can also arise fro m limitat ions in th e knowledg e of particular health care providers a bout medical information. Obviously no practitio ner can have instant co mmand of the fu ll rang e of medical knowledge. In some instances such ga ps in knowledge m ay reflect a failure to keep up with fund amentals; in others th ey may simply indicate a regrettab le but unavoidable limita tion of human capacity. 20 Richard Nis bett and Le e Ro ss, HUM AN IN FERENCE: STRATEGIES AN D SHORTCOMI NGS IN HUM AN JUD GEMEN T, P rentice-Ha ll, Inc. , Engl ewood Cliffs, N .J.

The C ommunication Process 87 A fifth , som ewhat di fferent type of uncertainty may be termed \"experiential\": th e limits o n an individual's ab ility to imag ine wh at life under very different circumstances would be like. A previously heal thy individual contemplating life as an i nvalid, for exam ple, or a p regnant wom an anticipating he r first labor and delivery faces certain i nherent limitatio ns in knowing how the n ew ex perience will feel. Each of these areas of uncertainty is to some d egree in evitable, but health care professi onals can and shou ld take steps to re duce them , where possible, and to help patients deal with those that rem ain. Continued biomedical research a nd efforts by professionals to rem ain informed wi ll reduce th e scop e of the unknown, both for m edicine as a whole and fo r individual practitio ners. Patien ts can be given some indication of th e extent of a pr ofessional's kno wledge\u2014sp ecialization, opinions by expert con Practitio ners can also share th e exp other patien ts in similar circu mstances (con sisten t wit h norms of con fidentiality), h elp patien ts to meet others who faced similar decisions, and work with patients to understand their ow n resources f or coping with and adapt ing to new situations. Attitud es toward uncerta inty. Both healt h ts may have difficu lty dealin g with the con cept of uncertain ty as well as the s ubstance. And for bo th, uncertainty can e voke uncomfortable emotions. Non etheless, in the Commission 's vi ew, where si gnifican t unce rtainty exists heal th care pro fessionals have a n obligation to discuss it with patients. Although there was variation among subgroups of those surveyed by the Co mmissi on, physician s on the av erage rep orted that th ey in itiate discussion and always o r usually d iscuss uncertain ties, and th e public feels physicians should raise such issues (s ee Figure 1). Interestingly, the public is generally less lik ely to feel th at physicians shou ld initiate d iscussion about uncertain ties about diagnoses (75%) than physician s repo rt they actually d o (90%). On the other hand, the public is m ore lik ely to feel tha t unce rtainties regarding the best course of treatm ent should be di scussed (80%) than are physicians to report bringing up such discussions (66%).21 21 Of the var ious subgroups exam ined, thos e wh o had had a l ife-threatening illness, who rece ived their care in a physician's off ice, who had high incomes, whose current he alth was excel lent, or who were young, white, or co llege-edu cated we re more likely to feel that doctors should in itiate d iscussion about these un certainties. Thos e in poo r health, the elderly, and th e least well educated wer e most likel y to say they were \"not sure\" wh ether such discussions should be initiated . 88 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 4 Not surp risingly, p hysician s who regard most (90-100%) of their patien ts as ab le to und erstan d most aspects of their conditions a nd treatments were m ore lik ely to discuss uncertain ties. Altho ugh there was some variation among physician subgroups, the differences were neither as regular nor as pr onounce d as t hose am ong t he pu blic.22Generally physicians who graduated from medical scho ol after 1972 were less likely than older physician s to report that th ey alw ays o r usu ally d iscussed uncertain ties. Given the burgeoning interest in informed co nsent and in litigation during the last d ecade, this is so mewh at surprisin g and serv es as a reminder t hat the law m ay influence \u2014but does not nece ssarily cont rol\u2014 relations hips t hat are s ubject to myri ad other subtle in fluences. However, many commentators ha ve noted that medical student s and young physicians are them selves unab le to deal with 22 Physicians in general or family practice were less likely than others to initiate discussion about most uncertain ties, although the one exception was for uncertainty regarding diagn osis, for which obstetricia ns/gynecologists were least l ikely to initiate discussio n. Surgeons were m ost likel y to report tha t they alwa ys or usuall y discussed uncert ainties with their patients . Office- based ph ysicians were m ore likely than hospital-b ased ones to discuss uncertainties. The C ommunication Process 89 uncertain ty, so much so that th ey are uncomfortable discussing it with patients.23 Only after being in practice for so me period of tim e do physician s reconcile th eir someti mes o verwhelming sense of responsibility to heal with the real limits an d uncertain ties inherent in medicine. The o bservational study of informed conse nt found that whe n the nature of th e patien t's prob lem is fair ly certain and a professional consensus exists about the best approach for dealing with that problem (for exam ple, general surg ery), p atients receiv e more in form ation about their illn ess and its treatm ent than w hen the nature and et iology of the problem, and t hus the best method fo r deal ing wi th it, are m ore unce rtain (for exam ple, cardi ology). Even when there is a high degree of uncertainty about a patient's problem, it was fo und that medical perso nnel tried to convey a sense of certai nty rath er than subtle in formatio n about the illn ess and its treatm ent. The stud y of treatm ent refusals f ound that ev en when physician s did discuss unce rtainty, pat ients oft en ha d a di fficult time understanding it. They sometimes eve n claimed to be unaware of information that study observers heard the physicians di scuss wi th them. One pat ient, for exam ple, who suffered from a \"feve r of unknown origin\" kept refusing to have any more bl ood tests des pite repeated ex planations that t hey were neces sary in order t o discover the reas on for her fever. The patient seemed un able to grasp the idea that her doctor really did not know why she had a fever and she wond ered why he did not just prescrib e an antibiotic. A similar example conce rned a patient with pa ncreatitis whose physician t old him honestly he did not know why he had it and what was causi ng pain even after an operation. Because \" no one ever told me why I had it,\" he said, he refused further diagnostic tests. Here, t oo, the patient seem ed una ble to believe that there was s omething the doctor did not know. It is perha ps not surprising that physician s may sometimes try to make things sound more certain than they really are in orde r to proceed w ith tests they consi der necessa ry, to do something co ncret e for pa tients, and t o avoi d undermining pe ople's confide nce in t hem, even t hough patients in su ch situations are d enied full opportunity to particip ate m eaningfully in decisio nmaking. Mode of and Barri ers to E ffective Com munication. The way information i s prese nted ca n great ly affe ct underst anding. Research has identified a number of influence s on t he success of the comm unication proce ss and the nature of the message receive d. T hese include the particu lar words used, the s tructure a nd fram ing of t he information, the ti ming of th e 23 Fox, Training for Uncertain ty, supra note 19 . 90 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 4 disclos ure, and the setting in whic h the discussion take s place. As alrea dy discuss ed, some kinds of information ar e inherently more di fficult than others to describe and to understand. The public was aske d: \"Do you usually come away from your doctor feeling that you have u nderstood the important issues relating to your treatm ent?\" Of all those sur veyed, 3 8% sai d they felt they unde rstood fully, 14% understood more than ad equat ely, 36% said adequately, and only 10% said their unde rstanding was usually less than a dequate. T he place of ca re and t ype o f relationshi p ha d significant effect s on the deg ree of self- reported understanding.24 In a follow-up question, aske d \"When a patient doe sn't understa nd his medical treatment, how oft en is this because the doctor did not explain things well?,\" 12% of the public said \"always,\" 7% were not sure.25 Thus, i t would appear from the Commission's survey that doctors believe m ost patients have the capa city to understand and that most patients feel they do understa nd most aspects o f their medical care an d regard promotion of this understanding as a t ask of the physician . The am ount of information that is actually unde rstood is more difficult to estab lish empirically. A number of studies pu rport to have examined the extent to which pat ients understand medical information, but unfortunately they all suffe r from several methodological shortcomings. The m ost serious flaw is that \"k nowledg e\" is u sually eq uated with \"comprehension.\" The typical study tests pat ients after they have read c onsent forms or t alked with physicians, in order t o determine whether they can repeat inform ation accurately. Some tests are multiple c hoice in nature, t hereby asses sing \"recognition\"; othe rs are ope n-ended, thereby testin g \"recall.\" While some tests are given immediately aft er disclosure, others are given after a substan tial p eriod of tim e has elap sed to test \"reten tion\" of information.26 24 Thos e receiving care in a doct or's office were more likel y than others to feel th ey fully understood ; those with no usual sour ce of medical care were most likely to report in adequate understand ing. People in poor health, th e eld erly, women, and those with less than a high scho ol educati on wer e more likely than others to r eport either that they fully und erstood or that their understanding was inadequate, wit h fewer f alling in the middle categ ories of \"adequate und erstanding \" on the scale. 25 The college-educa ted wer e signific antly more lik ely than thos e with little education to say it was alway s or often th e docto r's fault (51% versus 31%). People in poor health and the elderly were less lik ely to blame th e doctor for th eir lack of understanding and more lik ely to be unsur e (up to 19%) whether it was the docto r's fault. 26 See, e.g., the review ar ticle b y Alan M eisel and Loren H. Rot h, What We Do an d Do Not Know About Informed C onsent, 246 J.A.M.A. 2473 The C ommunication Process 91 Although knowledg e is a n ecessary con dition for co mprehension it is not sufficien t. True understan ding invo lves th e ability to use inform ation rationally. Ve ry few em pirical studies have atte mpted to examine how information is u sed in the decisio nmaking process. Little is k nown about variation s in knowledg e and understand ing that are related to the nature of the patient or the condition for wh ich treatmen t is being proposed. For information to have been com municated successf ully, it needs not only to have been disclose d, but also attende d to, unde rstood, accept ed, remembered, and put to use. For patients to use i nform ation, they m ust pay attention to the physicians' communications, select out the details important to them, interpret and integrate n ew knowledg e with information they alread y have, and later recall an d use th e information to make decision s. Not only are th ere fi nite li mits on people's ab ility to use information, but patients\u2014anxious, frustrated, t rying to understand unfamiliar ye t threateni ng inform ation\u2014are at a se rious disadvantage when it com es to absorbing what physicians say. At the very first step\u2014paying atten tion to what is said \u2014limitatio ns of the patients' abilit y to process in formation are probably most evident. It is difficu lt for patien ts to pay atten tion to details about their th erapy wh en they are th inking, and probably worrying , abou t the diagnosis given earlier i n the interview. In addition to the limiting effects of th e patient's em otional state, th e lack of familiarity with the topic being discussed constrains the patient's ability to atten d to essen tial messag es. Peop le can not possibly rem ember every wo rd they heard during d iscussion s with health professio nals. Rath er, they extract what they co nsider to be the important points. Unfortunately, patients may not know which ideas a re most important medically. They may not realize the im plications of w hat is being sai d because they do not recognize the special meanings of m edical phrases , especi ally ones that do not soun d \"med ical.\" Fo r example, it h as been found th at th e phrase \"adm itted (1981).

Heal th care profession als can assist patients by indicatin g which in formation is medically important and t he reaso ns why, by avoi ding jargon, by timing discussi ons so as t o minimize anxi ety, and by holding discussi ons in a settin g that will en courag e patients to ask questio ns. Practitio ners sh ould be particularly carefu l abo ut how th ey presen t information concerning uncertain ty. In some instances, th ere is no neutral or obviously correct fo rmulation; however the information is co nveyed, it will carry so me distinctive bias th at will affect h ow it is h eard. An attem pt to be neutral is qu ite differen t, however, from deliberately presen ting or framing facts to induce a p articular reactio n. \"Yo uare v ery ill; b ut, even so, alm ost every one survives this operation\u2014 only 17% di e\" is comprehen ded very differen tly from \"Yo u are not doing too well, and the only op eratio n that might help kills n early one in every five patien ts.\" Su ch form ulations are not nece ssaril y deceptive, but they certainly can be manipulative in th e sense of eliciting a different deci sion from that which might resul discussi ons.29A more of comm unication and aneffort t o pre sent c omplex information ab out uncertainty in seve ral ways coul d achieve a m ore well rounded understanding of what is at stake. Suc h an approach would do much to adva nce the values of patie nt wel fare and self-determ ination. Finally, h ealth care practitio ners often find their ab ility to inform patients seve rely const rained by the limited or nonexistent history of their relationship. Often professionals do n ot know patients before their current crises an d may neve r have known them as reas onably healthy individuals. Furthermore, when people are ill, th ey are often frigh tened and in pain, which can com promise co mmunication.

Physicians who remain standing w hen they enter patients' rooms create a diffe rent impression than those who sit down by patients' beds to talk. Justificatio ns fo r Less Tha n Full Disclo sure. Quite apa rt from these barriers to effectiv e co mmunicatio n, there ma y be times when a full communication process is not desi rable and should not be required. The l aw recognizes a num ber of such situa tions. These \"e xceptions t o informed consent,\"30 when properly invoked, shift all or part of t he decisional authority f rom the patientto someone else. Th e ex ceptio ns fall unde r several headings: (1) legal emergenci es; waiv er; and (5) th erapeutic privilege. Inform ed cons ent is not re quired in certain i nstances i n which m edical interventions are d irected orauthorized by law. T hese inc lude ce rtain tests perform ed pursuant to the authority o f police officers o r of pub lic h ealth officials, suc h as t esting d rivers f or inebriation or immunizing sch ool childre n against contagious diseases.31 Since co nsent need not be sought in such circumstances, \"i nformed consent\" is a misnom er. N onetheless, it may still b e appropriate to discuss with a person the nature of th e pro cedure and the reasons for it, ou t of respect for that per son, even thou gh such discussion is not intended to assist th e ind ividual in m aking a cho ice. The em ergency exception applies when immediate treatm ent is required to preserv e life or prevent a serio us impairment to health but consent cannot be obtained from a pat ient (or from som eone em powe red to authorize treatmen t on the patien t's behalf) and there is no indication that the treatm ent would be ref used we re the pat ient then abl e to make hi s or he r wish es known. It is so metimes said that co nsent in such situations is \"implied by law,\" by analogy to situations in which a patient by his or her conduct implies consent witho ut explicitly giving it,32This ter minology is misleading.

The rem aining three exce ptions act ually com prise modifications i n, rather than elimin ations of, the usual rules fo r informed consent. A p atient's informed consent is not requ ired in cases of in capacity to make a particula r decision. As discusse d in Part Four, however, the requirement of consent is not eliminated; rather, a surrogate m ust exercise the authority on be half o f an incapacitated patient. It may stil l be appropriate to inform such patients of the nature o f their situatio n and to seek to inv olve them in the decisionm aking process , even when th ey do not have the cap acity to make legally binding d ecision s. The modest atten tion paid to the fourth exception\u2014waiver\u2014in the courts and scho larly literatu re is reg rettab le given its in terestin g relation ship to the value of self- determination that under lies th e doctrine of informed consent. As obser ved in Chapter Two, self-determination encom passes both the moral right to formal con trol over a decision a nd the ideal of active particip ation in the decisionmak ing process. Although these two senses of self-determination often go hand in hand, sometimes they do not, as in the case of a waiver, when a patient as ks not to be informed of certain m atters and/or delegates deci sional authority to another person. The im pact of the wai ver exception is that if a waiv er is p roperly obtained the patient rem ains the ultimate decisio nmaker, bu t the content of his decisio n is sh ifted from th e decisio nal lev el to the meta d ecisio nal level from the equivalentof \"I wan t this treatm ent (or that treatm ent or no treatm ent)\" to \"I don't want any information about the treat ment.\"33 The leg al requirem ents for effectiv e waiv er in the context of inform ed consent have never been clearly articulated by t he courts. T here is substan tial reaso n to believe that the courts would res pect waive rs of certain information (f or e xample, the di sclosure of particular risks) or the delegation of certain decision s to others. Yet it is q uestionable whether patients should be permitted to waive the profession al's ob ligation to disclose fundamen tal in formatio n about the n ature an d implicatio ns of certain procedures (such as, \"when you wake up, you will learn that you r limb has been amputated\" or \"that you are irrev ersibly sterile\").

The fi nal exce ption t o inform ed cons ent, which has been the subject of substan tial co mmen t, is called therapeutic privilege an d p ermits professionals to refrain from making a disclosure that could so seriously upset a patient that it would be countertherapeutic.34 The o bvious danger with s uch an exception is t he ease with which it can swallow th e rule, thereby leg itimatin g wholesale n oncompliance wit h the general ob ligation of di sclosure.35 Acco rdingly, som e court s and c ommentators hold that the scope of th erapeutic priv ilege sh ould be severely circu mscrib ed, and that, at the least, th e privilege should not apply in situ ations wh en the po tential harm to the patient from full disclosure would resu lt not from the disclosure itself, b ut from a treat ment decisio n the practitio ner fears the patient might make as a res ult of t he information di sclosed.36 More pl ausible claim s of therapeutic 34 Iron ically , the \"privilege\" not to disclo se was f irst recognized b efore th ere was a well-est ablished legal du ty to make disclosure .

Interestingly, physicians w ho had graduated from medical school ten years ago or sooner we re m ore likely than older physicians t o withhold information ab out treatment risks a nd alternativ es and abou t diagnosis an d prognosis.

Further questioni ng re vealed that in nearly two-th irds of in whic h physici ans withhol d \"bad news\" the decision t o do so is ra rely o r neve r based upon the pat ients' wi shes.38 Moreover, when m embers o f the public were asked \"Ha ve you e ver asked a d octor not to tell you 'bad news '?,\" only 2% said yes, although 5% of thos e who ha d received care in a setting ot her than a doct or's office, o r who were i n poor health, or who had less than a high school education sai d yes.

Nevertheless, physicians do bel ieve i n disclosing information t o patients' relativ es\u2014a step that may alert them to potential id iosyncratic objection s to an intervention or other special facts b ut that still falls far sho rt of shared decisionmaking with the pat ient.39Of physicians su rveyed, 80% said they \"u sually d iscussed the withh member,\" 10% said \"s ometimes,\" 4% sai d \"rarely,\" and 38 Physicians we re asked: \"For those patients to whom y ou do not disclose 'b ad news,' how ofte n is this becaus e they tell you dir ectly they don' t want to know \"ne ver.\" Not surprisingly , physicians treating high proportions of s eriously ill patients were most likely to say \"alw ays\" (17%). 39 The legal st atus of disclosure to pati ents' re latives when the therapeu tic privilege is invoked is un certain. See Meisel, supra note 30 , at 465-67 . 98 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapte r 4 40 Among specialists and subs pecialists, 11% were not sure; among doctors who graduated between 1966 and 1972, 8% wer e not sure. Obstetricians were the least likely (68%) and surgeons the m ost likel y (88%) to report th at the y usual ly did discuss with th e family inform ation the y had with held from a patient. 41 In gener al, older, less well-ed ucated pe ople and those in poor health wer e more likely to feel that withho lding informati on was justifiab le; these groups were also more likel y to e xpress uncertain ty than others . There is no recognition in law fo r withholding information from 3% sai d \"never.\" In an unusual resp onse 3% said they were \"not sure.\"40 The res ponses of the public, whe n asked whether a physician w ould be justified in with holding info rmatio n about a medical co ndition or treatm ent from a patient, more clo sely p arallel ex isting law th an do those in the physician sam ple (see Fi gure 2). A majority of the public only disapproved of physician s withh olding in formation wh en th e withholding occu rs because the inform ation m ight m ake the patient unwil ling to undergo treatm ent believed t o be m edically necessary . However, more than two- thirds of tho se respon ding thought a physician wou ld be justified in withholding inform ation if the p atient asked for it to be with held or if th e information m ight significantly harm the pat ient's heal th.About half those in the public sa mple find non disclosure accep table if t he patient's fam ily asked that the patient not be told (which 8% of the public reports having done) or if the information m ight make the patient upset or anxious.41 The C ommunication Process 99 Effects of di sclosure an d nondisclosure. Despi te the fair amount of conceptual atten tion paid to the notion of therap eutic priv ilege, there is very little empirical evidence to indicate wh ether and in what ways in formation can be harm ful.42 Clearly there is a need to d efine \"harmful\" or \"negative\" consequences better and to distinguish between situational anxi ety (caused by illness or hospitalizatio n) an d anx iety resu lting from inform ation. In addition, the mere fact t hat some inform ation may be \"upsetting\" in and of itself d oes not justify withho lding information.43 Early em pirical studies so ught to discover how patients would respon d to certain k inds of info rmation that m ight be provided. Now t hat th e law requires informatio n about risk s to be disclosed, a nu mber of stud ies hav e sought ways to reduce a nxiety associated with such information. Potential as well as act ual patients have been asked whether t hey would want to know about risks of treatment; som e patients, after having been informed, have been asked whether the informatio n was upsettin g. A study o f hypothetical situations found that people often sai d they would not want information about risks .44 However, studies wi th real patients indicate that although information is som etimes upset ting, vi rtually all patients went ahead with procedures and thought the information was useful.45 Some people have argued that informing pat ients about therapy can reduce therapeutic effect iveness by underm ining the placebo c ompone nt of treatm ent.46 Clinicians ha ve long realized t hat patients are cured not only by a speci fic treat ment, but als o by the knowledge that they have undergone a treatm ent and that relief is imminent. Thus the suggest ion patients at the request of a f amily member. Whether or not a physician is enti tled to withhold information th at might make a pa tient u pset or anxious depends on whether the con cern is merely with ups etting the p atient o r with caus ing the pat ient to ect the doctor's therapeut ic advi ce. 42 Meise l and R oth, supra note 2 6. 43 Testimonies of Debra L.

F or some, prepa ratory information may redu ce their ability to deny the threat; for others, it may sensitize th em to specific th reats, rath er than general fears; for still o thers, it may be a si gn o f soci al support or a way to divert attention, re focus cognitive effort, o r elicit certa in coping respo nses.

Anecdotal reports doc ument that at least so me patients refuse treatm ent because of fear of t he therapy. Howeve r, in one of the Commission's observational studies, which was t he first systematic attempt to determine the frequ ency of treat ment refusals a nd their ca uses and outcomes, refusals w ere found to occur abou t once per 15-20 patient days. As indicated earlier in th is Chapter, m ost involved m inor treatm ents, not life-threatening procedures. And, perhaps most importantly, th e trigg er for refusing treatmen t was not too much but too litt le information. Patien ts wh o refused treatments typically did so because t he nature, p urpose, and attendant risks of the procedures ha d not been adequately explained. The Relationship of Ethical and Legal Standards From all that has been said , it is clear that th e disclosure an d communication p rocesses s hould be geared to the nee dsof particular patien ts in given health situations. Professio nals sho uld seek to elicit th e individual's goals and values and to frame the discussion in those t erms, with due regard to th e patient's em otional need s and intellectu al cap acities. To what ex tent can or sh ould the law ai d movement in this direction ? The Devel opment of Legal Rules. To date, no America n jurisdiction has a dopted legal requirements for informed consent fully congruent with the ethical objectives set forth in this Repo rt.60 The reasons for this a re partly h istorical: in most jurisdictions, failu re to obtain informed consent is treated as a form of medical negligen ce or malpractice. T o assess whether a particu lar act o r omission constitutes m alpractice, th e leg al syste m usually relies on professional standards of practice. Thus, in a lawsuit alleging lack of informed cons ent, the behavior of the defendant has traditionally been assessed in light of the \"professional standa rd\" of disclosure\u2014that is, wha t other physicians would have disclosed in like circum stances. The law's treat ment of info rmed consent c laims as a kind of m edical negligence and the resulting adop tion of th e professi onal stand ard of disclosure tacitly assu me that full disc losure is a recognized part of accept ed medical p ractice, an d that departures fro m it lab el the practitio ner as failin g to live up to the professio nal stand ard. Th is assu mption has been extensively criticized by scho lars.61 Although both disclosure 60 See generally Katz, supra note 1. 61 See, e.g., Capron, supra note 3 6, at 407-10 ; Katz, supra note 1, at 154-60 . The C ommunication Process 103 and c onsent have long been advocated an d pract iced by som e,62 medical practice d id not join the dual obligation s of d isclosure and consent in the sense of \"i nform ing for deci sion\" until ve ry recently. Thus reliance on a profession al stan dard of d isclosure is u nlikely to provide much legal encourag ement for th e ideal o f effectiv e patient particip ation in decision making set forth in this Repo rt. Nevertheless, to th e degree that profession al attitu des and stan dards change over tim e in the direction of greater res pect for, a nd encouragem ent of, patient particip ation in decisionmaking, t he use of a p rofessi onal standa rd will con form more closely with t he objecti ves set forth in this Report. Since 1 970, a number o f American j urisdictions have a bandoned use of the professi onal standard and m oved at least part of the way toward a legal stand ard oriented more to the needs of the particular p atient. With some variation in specifics, t hese cour ts have st resse d that the standar d of disclosure is properly set by society rath er th an by the medical p rofession, and t hey have ado pted a st andard that responds t o the informational needs of the hypothet ical \"reasona ble patient.\" The C ommission finds this approach com mendable in recognizing that the appropriate standa rd is societal rather th an professio nal an d in redirecting the in quiry toward th e needs of t he patient. Howev er, a stan dard based only on the needs of a reasona ble patient offe rs no assu rance th at the well-b eing or th e self-d eterm ination of a p articular patient will be adva nced by the workings of the law. Numerous commentators have ur ged that the law of i nformed conse nt take the next step, m oving beyond the reasonable patient standa rd to one that is more att entive to the inform ational needs of p articular patients.63 The critical issue i n this debate conce rns the degree t o which providers should be legally required to take into acco unt the informational need s of particular patients that differ from those of the \"reas onable pat ient.\" S ome commen tators focus differences; o thers call up on practitio ners to press their patients for a clearer a rticulation of their individual goals, values, and informational need s, which would then set an individual standard for disclo sure. Su ch an evo lution in legal requ irements wou ld move the law into closer con formity with the moral ob ligations of health care profes sionals that are set forth i n this Report. 62 Martin S.

Much of the difficu lty arises fro m the fact th at moral o bligation s define a st andard of co nduct for i ndividuals while legal requi enforceab occurs v ia liti gation conducted long after inju ries h ave occurred , on the basis of evi dence that m ay include selective and self-serving ass ertions by parties with a co nsiderable stak e in the outcome. Such a situatio n makes reliab le determin ations of the individual parties' wi shes, need s, an d intentions regarding the original communication very difficult, which helps explain the law's deci ded preference for m ore objective standa rds, even at th e cost of so me injustice in particular cases.66 Thus there m ust be some balance be tween the et hical objectives the law see ks to enc ourage and the technica l dem ands of a workab le litig ation pro cess. Th e Co mmission recogn izes th at fu rther evolution of legal standards toward a firmer protection of individual self- determination in medical d ecisio ns must be tempered by a reco gnition of the law's lim its as an instru ment of so cial con trol.67 Attitude s tow ard the Law . In the Com mission's survey, several questions to physician s and the public dealt with the legal doctrine of informed co nsent. The majority of both groups agreed that patients' rights to information sh ould be protected by law (see Fi gure 3). However, significan tly more ph ysician s than patients agreed with the state ment \"Time spent discussi ng diagnosis, prognosis, and treatm ent coul d be bet ter spent taking care of patients.\" Th e public was m ore lik ely th an ph ysician s to think that the legal requirements for obtaining toward determin ing what must be disclo sed to patients, though no cour t has ever expres sly held that a he alth c are profes sional must disclose what the par ticular patient would have wanted to know. A sim ilar issue exists with respect to the test of causation to be emplo yed. Althou gh courts have n ot only hinted but actu ally decided that whe ther or not the failure to disclose \"cause d\" the patient's injury is to be determined b y reference to wh ether or not a \"reas onable\" person would have r efused the treatment had he or she been properly infor med, a few cas es and s tatutes have begun to reject this formulation, focusing instead on whether the particular patient would have refu sed treatment had disclosure been proper . 65 See Alan M eisel and L isa D.

The C ommunication Process 105 inform ed cons ent were clear and e xplicit (52% versus 32%), and doctors were m ore lik ely th an the public to feel th at the req uirements put too much emphasi s on disclosure of remote risks (73% versus 44%). Finally, bot h groups were a sked whi ch disclosure standard wa s bes t (see Figure 4). More than 40% of the physicians and the public tho ught that a standar d based on the informational needs o f a part icular pat ient was preferable to a reasona ble pa tient or physician standard. Physician s were th en ask ed wh ether they knew which stand ard applied in the state(s ) in which t hey practi ced. Only 23% said they did. Surgeons were m ore likely than any other specia lty to say they knew (3 0%), and older doctors were more likely than younger ones to claim knowledge of their state's standard (27% ve rsus 17%). Overall, of the 23% who claimed to know the stand ard, 54% of those practic ing in states that have a standa rd gave the c orrect answer. The Use of Consent F orms. Consent forms, whi ch we re ori ginally intended as documentation of disclosure and con- 106 Making Heal th Care Deci sions: Chapter 4 sent, have in many cases come to substitute for t he very processes th ey are intended to substantiate.68Furtherm ore, t here a ppears to be s ubstant ial variation am ong health care professi onals abo ut when consent forms are required69 deriving in many cases fro m institutional differences in interpretatio n of the law. And the law is, in fact, often unclear an d nons pecific a bout the require ments for c onsent. Seve ral different conse nt form s are in use. Ho spitals often require patients upon admission to sign a blanket conse nt that purports to give physicians a uthority to \"treat as necessary.\" The J oint Com mission o n Accred itatio n of Hospitals req uires, th at sep arate con sent forms be signed for any procedure or treatment \"for which it is appr opriate\" and t hat these form s be incl uded in the medical record.70It appears from one of the observational studies c onducted for the Presi dent's Commission t hat physicians dee \"proce dures\" \u2014in contrast to \"ro utine c are\"\u2014as appropriate fo r written con sent. Pro cedures are 68 See, e.g ., Bradford H. Gray , Complexi ties of Informed Consent, 437 ANN. AMER. ACAD. POLIT. SOC. S CI. 37 (1978). 69 \"As a legal matter, consent form s are rare ly required . Those state infor med consent statutes that de al with consent form s make them perm issible, not m andatory. Even th e fed eral regulations gov erning th e cond uct of f ederally funded research do not requ ire cons ent form s in all instanc es.\" Alan Meisel , More o n Making Consen t Forms Readable, 4(1) IRB 9 (Jan . 1982) . 70 Joint Commission on Accr editation of Hospitals, ACCREDITATION MANUAL FOR HOSPITALS, Chicago , Ill. (1981) at 84-86 . The C ommunication Process 107 done relativ ely in frequ ently an d include most invasive measures, as well as major diagnostic tests th at ca rry so me risk. Risk itself, ho weve r, does not distinguish the pro cedures for which written con sent is tho ught to be required; written consent is typically n ot obtained for medicatio ns, even when major and frequent risks attend their use.71 Preprinted \"fill-in-the-blank\" forms are us ed for many procedures, especially surgery. T he em phasis in these form s is on obtaining permission rather than on giving information, f or they state that the general cate gories of legally material information have previously bee n \"fully expl ained.\" Some form s are specially prepare d, as in the case of the stress tests for cardi ac pat ients obse rved in one o f the Commission's s tudies. He re the nature o f the test an d its atten dant risk s were su bstantially d ifferen t than for invasi ve procedures, and the form provided the only information pat ients receive d unless they chose to initiate a discussion after rea ding it.72 In the Commission's survey, phy sicians were asked whethe r they usually obt ained consent\u2014and if so, in what form\u2014for a variety of procedures. The frequency with which consent was obtained varied significantly with the nat ure of the procedure; virtually all doct ors reported getting co nsent for i npatient surgery, and about half those s urveyed re ported they did not get conse nt for prescri ptions and blood tests (see Tabl e 3). This finding was s ubstantiated in the Commission's two observational studies. States' in formed consent laws (with the single except ion of Te xas) do not delineate consent requirements on a procedure-by-proc edure basis. Nor does the law on informed cons ent gene rally distinguish between oral and written consent in judging validity; that is, written consent is n ot required where oral consent has bee n given.73 Indeed, one state's statute and the cas e law in three states ex plicitly hold that co nsent need not be in writing in order to be va lid.74 However, a sign ed written con sent form is lik ely to make legal proof of con sent significan tly easier, at least in the absence of other complicating factors. Ph ysician s' consent practices apparently reflect this assu mption. Physician s and the public were ask ed whether they agreed with several statem ents reg arding consent forms (see Fig ure 5). 71 Charl es W.

Cf. Eleanor Singer, Informed Consent: Consequences for Response Rate and Response Quality in Social Survey, 43 AM. SOC. REV. 144 , 151 (1978) . Nearly fou r-fifths of the public and 55% of the physicians think the primary purpose of con sent forms is to protect physician s from law suits.75 This finding seem s to re flect m ore the ad vice of lawyers who represe nt heal th care profes sionals tha n the ethical basi s of informed consent, in wh ich the role of th e consen t form is to protect p atients by ensuring thatthey have full information and are pa rticipating v oluntarily. The majority of phy sicians (64%) and t he public (65%) think that consent form s hel p doct or-patient communicatio ns. Concerning written consent forms, 62% of the physician s and 86% of the p ublic th ink th at a p atient's sign ature estab lishes that the individual has given consent. Of the 24 st ates with statutes on i nformed cons ent, only 13 make so me attempt to define the leg al effect o f a sig ned consent form. As noted above, a sig ned form will always be some evidence th at the patient actual ly consented to the treatment, and a jury could use i t, along with other evidence, to support or rebut the existen ce of actu al consent. Howev er, the The ommunication Process 109 type of rebu ttal ev idence an d the circu mstances under which it is allo wed vary.76 In addition, information that must be included in the con sent form in order for it to be ha ve legal weight varies by state. In G eorgia, for example, the form need not disclose any risks of the proposed procedu re; only the gene ral nature of the treatment need be set forth.77Louisiana, on the othe r hand, 76 In some states plaintiffs are allo wed to pr ove they did n ot understand the standardi zed con sent form they signed. F or exam ple, one cour t stated that \" the effe ct to be given to a standard consent form is governed b y the same principles used in evalu ating app ellant's claim under the in formed consent doctrin e. Thus, unless a person has b een ad equately apprised of the m aterial risks and therapeu tic alternatives incident to a pr oposed treatment, an y consent giv en, be it oral or written, is necessarily ineffectua1 .\" Sard v. Hard y, 379 A.2d 1014, 1019 n.3 (Md. 1977). In that case, a sign ed form is subje ct to the same type of rebu ttal as would be directe d against testimony that oral cons ent had been given. Other states restrict the ty pe of eviden ce th at may be presen ted to rebut a sign ed written consen t form . Som e allow only strict leg al proof of fraud o r misrepre sentation. In one cas e, for exam ple, th e plaintiff proved that she had not read the c onsent f orm that she had signed, but since she presented no legal excuse for not reading the form, she was h eld to be bound by its terms.

Tho se in poor h ealth were th e most sat isfied (92%) an d those rep orting th eir health statu s as fa ir were th e least satisfied (60%). Th e explanation of such a substantial difference bet ween these t wo groups (when it would seem more likely that the largest difference would be between those in excellen t and those in poor health) is not clear.79 Whe n the people who had si gned a co nsent form within the last year were as ked \" After readi ng the consen t form, did you feel that you fully understood the risks of the treatment you were going to undergo?,\" 72% said \"yes,\" alt hough this varied by subgroups just as th e satisfactio n with the ex planation did. Fin ally, th ese people were aske d: \"Have you eve r refuse d treatment beca use of what you learned about the treatm ent from the written consent form?\" Only 5% said they had.80 78 La. Rev . Stat. Ann. \u00a7 40 :1299.40(A) (West Cu m. Supp. 1980). 79 Those surveyed who had no u sual source of m edical care, the middle-aged (35-50 years old), and those with less than a high school education were all less likely than people who had a usual source of care, the young , the old, and th e better educated to view th e explan ation of the c onsent form as satisf actor y. 80 Women were more likel y tha n men to have refus ed tre atment becaus e of wh at they learn ed fro m a consent for m (7% versus 3 %) and those w ithout any health insurance wer e the m ost likel y (12%) to h ave refused tr eatment on this basis. Refusers were likely to be young , college-educated, in f air or poor health, and p eople who receive care in a doctor's off ice. There is strong eviden ce that ex isting c onsent f orms are written in extremel y turgid prose an d that pati ents have a gr eat d eal of difficulty understanding them, even if they do not admit it.

MED. 900 (1 980). The C ommunication Process 111 Physicians we re aske d in an open-ended question what the effect of consent form s had been: 52% thou ght they h ad a positiv e effect (for exam ple, that they improve d patient awa reness so patients knew more about their treatment and risks and aske d more and better quest ions, encouraged more com munication bet ween doctors and patients, and provided legal protectio n for doctors and ho spitals); 23% felt th at con sent forms had a negative e ffect (for exam ple, that th ey increase patients' fears , reduced compliance, c aused patients to avoid necessary treatment, made pat ients distrust th eir do ctors, in creased law su its, an d provided no leg al protection ); 18% thought that informed cons ent forms had no effect; and 7% we re not sure whether they had an effect or not. The Com mission's obse rvational studie s sugge st that cons ent form s are typically read and si gned after a deci sion has been made rega rding treatm ent.81 This is probably as it sh ould be, assu ming that th e form is presented fo r signature after discussion and th at the patient h as particip ated in making the deci sion. In t he Commission's view, c onsent forms shoul d summarize d iscussion , but not be a sub stitute fo r it. Ideally, th ey wi ll stimulate addi tional questions and di scussion, as som e physicians in the survey indicated, but th ey should not be allowe d to replace such communication or to cut it off prem aturely. 81 Mor e often than not, how ever, discussion p rior to consen t form signing was nonexistent or b rief. See Lidz and Meisel, supra note 71; Pau l S. Appelbaum an d Loren H. Ro th, Treatment Re fusal in Medi cal Hospitals (1982), Appendix D, in Volum e Two of this Repor t. Means III The precedi ng portions of this Repo rt have set forth the Commiss ion's vision of the pat ient-professional relationship as a flexible arrangement, defined i n substantial part by the desires of the parties and the demands of the situ ation. The obligation o f the professio nal is to prov ide each patient with a basi s for effective participation in decisionmaking abo ut his or h er own health care. Thi s obligation entails providing info rmation, answering questions, talking over options and doubts, and hel ping patien ts to clari fy the values an d goals relev ant to the decisio n. Such discussion serv es to enha nce patients' com petenc e and he nce the likelihood that the course of actio n selected represen ts the patient's voluntary cho ice. In this portion of the Report, the Commission exam ines several way s to bring this vision closer to reality. First, t he Commissio n has examined several in novations in practice (all with in the scope of existing law), including i ncrease d efforts i n patient education to promote self-co nfidence and the ab ility to be an activ e participant in heal th care deci sionmaking; broadened so urces of information, such as hospital lib raries and pha rmacists; and a ppropriate efforts to engage pat ients' families in these processes . The Com mission finds that th ere are a n umber of techn iques th at co uld facilitate effectiv e patient participatio n in health care decision making. Although the experience with m ost of these innovations is t oo sligh t to justify recommending them as st andard practice, th e Commissio n identifies in Chapter Five seve ral that, on the basis of their inherent logic and early resul ts, deser ve furt her st udy and ex perimental appl ication. T he Fed eral government now sp ends many billions of dollars a year o n health care, of which some $5 billion is all ocated to health -related research, fro m basic laboratory scien ce to larg e-scale stu dies with patients. The Co mmission believes that the effectiv eness of health care\u2014ind eed, its true quality in terms of i mprovi ng 114 Making Health Care Decisions: Part III patients' well-being and satisfying their needs\u2014would be nced by support of beh avioral r esearch hows rve to bematched by improvem ents in the human side of he alth care, whi ch has been the cent ral conce rn of the Commissio n in this Repo rt. Th e Co mmissio n recommends that th e Depa rtment of Heal th and Human Ser vices, an d particularly the National Institutes of Health , develop appropriate in itiativ es an d exp licitly encourag e the pursuit of scien tifically so und studies in this field . The Co mmission believes that wh at is u ltimatel y needed to improve mutual respect and participation and shared deci sionmaking i n health care are Chapter Six ex amin es cu rrent tren ds an d innovations in medical and nursing education to assess what might be done to encourage and reinforce em pathic qualities in health care p rofession als, to improve communication not only between professionals and patients but also am ong health care p rofessionals, and to promote the basi c val ues of health care by ensuring that patients are active, inform ed decisionm akers about their he alth care. Again, a n umber of promising av enue s exi st, and the Co mmission reco mmends that tho se involved in the edu cation and training of health professionals, bot h wi thin the Fede ral government and, more importantly, at academic institu tions, syste matical ly explore t hese aven ues. At the very least, medical and nursing students should be be tter educate d about the issues and objec tives of inform ed c onsent that are explored in this Report. Finally, in Chapter Seve n the Commission considers whet her changes in the existing law of inform ed consent might more effecti vely p romote the objectiv es id entified by the Commissio n and evaluates the costs ass ociated with such changes. Although the law has a use ful role in defining certain minimal standards a nd processes, t he intimate and necessari ly diverse nature of th erapeutic relationsh ips cannot be fully p rescribed or enforced by law. Th e Commissio n does no t believe that the law needs to be modified through new statutes on ordinary physician-patient interactions but regards the con cepts dev eloped in this Rep ort as useful for judges in the resolution of cases a nd for clarification of th e common law. Statutory law m ay be appropriate, howeve r, as a m eans of ensuring patients greater adhe rence t o their s\u2014through \"adva nce direc tives\"\u2014after they lose the capaci ty for personal participation in decisionmaking. Practical Innovations As discusse d in Part Two of this Report, the goal s of informed co nsent and the realities in practice often diverge. Many innovative and practica l suggestions have bee n put forward on how to alter com munications between patients and health care professionals to meet the goals of informed consent more fu lly. In addition to ideas taken from the existing literatu re, the Commissio n heard testi mony from a number of witnesses conce rning ways to improve com munications ge neral ly and t he informed consent proce ss specifically. Suggestio ns included (1) prepari ng patients better fo r effectiv e particip ation in health care decisio nmaking; (2) providing patients with more so urces of in formation; and (3) in volving family members more fully in the decisi onmaking process . Preparing the Patient for Effective Par ticipation To achi eve the goal s of o pen communication an d sha red decisionm aking in m edical care, not only must health professi onals pos sess certain interperson al skills an d attit udes, bu t patients must be willin g and able to participate. The C ommission vi ews communication bet ween pat ient and profession al, no t sim ply th e disclosure of risks, as essen tial to promoting the value of sel f-determination di scuss ed in Part Two of this Report and ensuring that patients particip ate voluntarily, co mpetently, a nd knowledgeably in decision making about their care. As d iscussed in Chapter Fou r, to particip ate effectively in the decisionmaking p rocess patients nee d information. S ome expert s have argued that the more patients know abou t health in general, th e better ab le they will b e to particip ate meaningfully in any particular health care decision.1 Such gene ral 1 Testim ony of Donald Vickery , transcrip t of 15th meeting of the President's Commission (Dec. 11 , 1981) at 21-25. 5 116 Making Heal th Care Deci sions: Chapter 5 knowledge wo uld hel p patients consider whet her and whe n to seek care, realize what inform ation was important to volunteer to health care providers and t o ask a bout, and decide wh ether or not to consent to particular procedures. F urtherm ore, s pecific information a bout a pa tient's part icular condition may resu lt in a b etter u nderstandin g of the patient's own needs, better co mpliance with medical reg imens, greater invo lvement in the process , and improvem ents in health.2 A vari ety of techniques have been designed to help patients obt ain information they need a nd want, thereby e quipping them for a m ore active role in their care and for a more eq uitable partnership bet ween professional and patient. Development of these t echniques has been based on several important assumptions: (1) patients can particip ate m ore in health care decisio ns3; (2) such participation is of va lue both because it can prom ote greater commitm ent to the th erapeutic process , the reby enha ncing hea lth, and use promotes the val ue of self- determination4; (3) educat ion for heal th care decisionmaking is useful for all decisions, howeve r minor, and is therefore best see n as a process , not as som ething to be done once at a moment of crisis5; and (4) patients can effect ch anges in the relatio nship with th eir physician because heal th professionals respond to patient- initiated styles o f interaction .6 The Co mmission recognizes that, as in all of life, a little knowledg e can be a dangerous thing.

Practical In novatio ns 117 appreciate un certain ties and the probabilistic n ature of m edical kno wledg e. However, generally it has bee n found that having information an d understanding its implications i ncreases pat ients' self-confidence . Educated patien ts tend to m ore co mpetent about managing their illn esses an d freer to in teract with the medical staff.7 Given the numerous barriers to mean ingful prof ession al-patient com munications discuss ed in Chapter Four, presenting information i n a way that maximizes underst anding i s a prerequ isite for to provide informationto pat ients in language t hey can unde rstand and und er circu mstances th at will p romote understand ing. A layp erson can understand medical information better when simple, nonjargon language is used and when important concepts and implicatio ns are stated explicitly. For the message t o be understandable, health care professionals must be clear in their own minds abou t which informatio n is most important.8 This process of sel f-scrutiny may have t he additional bene fit of causi ng them to rethink, or at least to revi ew, t heir own diagnosis, prognosis, and recom mendat ions. Written and audiovisual m aterials can also aid the commu nicatio n process. Pam phlets an d numerous other aids, b oth written (stick ers, ch arts, brochures) and audiovisual (tapes, films, com puter-assisted instruction, slide shows) have bee n used to improve patient knowledge and t o explain treatm ent opt ions.9Such aids are use ful supplements to, but not replacem ents for, face -to-fa ce discussi on.10In ge believes that written materials, in cluding preprinted consen t forms, sho uld only augment the continuing process of information exchange. 7 This wa s discusse d by several witne sses who testifi ed at the 15th m eeting o f the President's Commission (Dec. 11, 1981) and is the rationale b ehind man y of the self-car e books in the popular market. 8 See, e.g., several studi es by Philip Ley and h is coll eagu es such as Phil ip Ley, Towards Better Doctor-Patient Communi catio ns: Contributio ns from Social and Experimen tal Ps ycholog y, in A.

A step as sim ple as allowing patients to take written materials h ome to read before m aking a decision (or s igning a cons ent form) can i mprove understanding.11 It removes t he needless pressures o f having to make a rapi d decision not required by the medical c ircumstances an d permits th e patient to raise questions wit h, and hear qu estio ns fro m, family members on th e information in the materials. Discu ssion with others is h elpful not only in providing other sources of information b ut also in reve aling issues t he patient is uncl ear about and may wish to raise ag ain with the health care professional. Some efforts have been made to \"test\" p atients at th e con clusion of th e consent proce ss to ascertai n whethe r they had For ce rtain pa tients and p rocedures, the Commission was impressed with the be nefits of ha ving patients wri te their ow n co nsent forms.13 As re counted by one medical witness, patients who have discussed with a ph ysician a particular elec tive proce dure under considerat its risk s and the alternativ e treat ments and their risk s, are aske d to go home and w rite down what they have underst ood. When they return t o the physici an's office with t his \"cons ent form,\" speci fic area s of m isunde rstanding ca n be i dentifie d and discuss ed until the physician is sure th at all p ertinent informatio n has been understood . The Co mmis sion believes t hat this approach dese rves further exploration and urges that studies be cond ucted in a variety o f medical sp ecialties to assess th e relat ive efficacy of s uch a consent process. The timin g of d isclosures is also important, especially when the discussi on or the medical setting is likely to provoke anxiety. For example, upon hearing a diagnosis of cancer, patients are t ypically so pre occupied with fear that detailed information is not heard or even desired.14 What little information is taken in is lik ely to be distorted . Similarly, a p regnant woman who has been told that her fetus is ab norm al might very well fail to absorb other information unless t he physician 11 See, e.g ., G. Morrow, J. Gootnick and A.

When the time sp ent with the patient is billed to a th ird-party p ayor, its validity is judged only by a standa rd of the rapeutic necessity, wh ich ha s not traditionally include d any independent obligation to h elp the patient particip ate in the d ecision making process . If the approach to in form ed consent proposed in th is Repo rt is t o be implemented in practice, certain incentives in the reimbursem ent syste m may have t o be re adjusted. Notably, nearly 40% of the public in the Commissio n's survey said th ey wo uld be willin g to pay more if th eir doctors spent more time expl aining routine care. P resumably this proportion would be even higher in cases o f serious illn ess.

It recommends that procedures\u2014wheth er preventive, diagnostic, or th erapeutic\u2014 be defined in suc h a way that a ppropriate communication and consent is rega rded as a necessa ry part of good patient care, rathe r than that a separate reimbursable cat egory of i nformation- giving be created.

Pharm acists and P amphlets for Patients on Medication. One of the areas where patients are most likely to need information is in the use of medication, since drugs are t he most common treatm ent in all medical ca re. Most visits to th e doctor result in a prescrip tion being written ; many patients with chronic diseases m ust take m edications over long periods of time; and many patients take se veral drugs simultaneously, often on the basi s of prescrip tions written by differen the providing basi c dr ug information, rei nforcing instructions about how to use drugs, and warning pat ients abo ut possible side ef fects and drug interactions\u2014has not been fully taken advantage of.

To date, PPIs have been used by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only for a limited number of dr ugs on an experimental basis.23Some physician groups have raised form al objections to PPIs because they fear patients will no longe r take what is p rescrib ed if th ey know all th e side effects. Ot hers worried that details on si de effect s would increase t he frequency with which pat ients percei ved them.24 A rece nt eval uation of PPIs conducted by the Rand C orporation found that patients generally h ad read the information sheets; tho ugh increases in side ef fects were reported, it was not clear whet her the i nform ation actua lly led to an increased perception of sym ptoms or merely to an increased an d more accurate attribution of thos esymptom s to the drugs. Perha ps most importantly, the Rand study found that PPIs led som e patients to discuss more fu lly with their ph ysician s the reaso ns for tak ing a d rug and its potential risks and benefits.25Thus, prov iding specific in formation with drugs appea rs to have opened up avenues for more m eaningful doctor- patient communication. Although the FDA recently shelve d the PPI program , the Am erican M edical Associ ation has begun a voluntary system under which physicians ca n purchase i nformation forms on 20 of the most widely prescribed drugs for 21 Letter to the Com mission from Howard An sel, Dean of the University of Georgi a School of Phar macy , April 19 82; pamphl et fr om the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy , Pharmacy Educa tion: Responding to the Nation's Health Care Needs, Bethesda, Md .

Many medical lib raries recei ve support from the Fede ral government under the Medical Library Assistance Act of 1965,35 which was intended to make m edical inform ation av ailable regardless of geographical location. Under this statute a num ber of regional libra ries ha ve been established so that \"qualified persons and organizations shall be entitled to free lo an serv ices.\" Wh ile th is issu e has not been tested in court, \"any individual who can read and who has a desi re to research a particular medical quest ion is a 'q ualified' user under the act \" and o ught to have access and l oan privileges to at least these fed erally estab lished regional libraries.36 In in stitutional arrang emen ts should be made so that indivi duals ca n ge nerally have access to whate ver m edical information is d esired, an d lib raries sh ould facilitate th ose info rmation need s whe never possi ble within the constraints of res ources.

Involvement of Family in the Process Another way to enhance pa tient-provider communications t hat was discuss ed by many of the Commission's witnesses is to involve a patient's family members more directly and deliberately in the informatio n process.38 For e xample, one of the intended si de ef fects of having patients go home to write th eir own \"con sent forms\" is th at it g ives o thers in the fam ily a ch ance to help the patient und erstan d the situatio n.39This issue ha s be en extensi vely address ed at the Maternity Center As sociation in New York, whose director testified before the Co mmiss ion on the importance of family involvement to prom ote understanding and sup port of a pregnant patient's preferen ces regard ing childbirth. At the Cen ter, invo lvement is co upled with detailed and candid informational materials.40 Several lay an d profession al witn esses ind icated that wh en families are not included in the disclosure process t hey feel left out and helpless.41 A pilot study c onducted at the NIH C linical Center, d escribed to the Commission, has be gun to doc ument the im portant effects of i ncluding families.42 Being involved in the process of discussion and decision allowed family members to feel they c ould be helpful and more act ively 38 \"Family \" may be defined br oadly to includ e closest relat ives a nd intim ate fri ends, since und er some circum stances, particularly when im mediate kin are absent, those with m ost conc ern for th e patient may not be actual relatives. 39 See p. 118 supra. 40 Testimonies o f Ruth Watson Lubic, transcript of 15th m eeting of the Presiden t's Commission (Dec. 11 , 1981) at 7-11. 41 Testimon y of Maxwell Bover man, transcri pt of 15th meeting of the Presiden t's Commission (Dec. 11 , 1981) at 15-20; test imonies of Minna Nathanson and Edw in Forman in panel discussion on the role of the fam ily in b iomedical d ecisions, transcrip t of 17th meeting of the President's Commission (Feb. 12 , 1982) at 114-9 1. 42 Testimon y of Boverman, supra note 41, and preliminar y report of th e stud y by John C.

It also app eared to facilitate co mmunicatio n within the fam ily generally b y estab lishing a practice of talkin g openly ev en about matters th at were un pleasan t. Famil y involvemen t often gave physicians a nd other heal th care pr oviders important information abo ut the patient that they might ot herwise not have receive d. Finally, family involvement seem ed to help co rrect errors a nd om issions in comm unications, not only because fam ily members re member things the patient has forgotten, but also bec ause they ask for information the professional has neglected to discuss . Beyond making the family feel more use ful and aiding professional- patient com munication, family involvement seem s to be t herapeutically desirable for two reaso ns. First, fam ily members hav e an en ormous influence on one another in terms of when and whether an individual actually gets sick ,43 recog nizing that so meone is ill an d deciding whether or not to seek care in itially,44facilitat ing or hindering adherence to medical regimens,45 and ultimately, at least in some instances, i nfluencing treatm ent outcomes.46 Second, t he int erdependence of family members makes any particular in dividual's illn ess a fa mily problem.47In some ways, th erefore, the fam ily may be viewed as th e unit of care, which means it n eeds to b e involved in medical deci sionmaking because the e ffects of decisions a bout anyone member will affect th e entire family. The value of full and activ e involvement of patients' famil ies, lik e other st rategies f or improvi ng patient-professional relation s and communications, deser ves further study.

Fam ilies are no t always c ooperativ e un its. Th ey may interfere, press ure, m isinterpret , and misinform.

Professional Outlook and Behavior The ge neral acceptance by health care professi onals of the obligation s inherent in a p rocess of m utual particip ation and shared decision making is intimately tied to th eir attitu des toward th eir p atients and colleagu es. Su ch attitu des are form ed over many years and are m ore subject to gradual evolution th an to rapid change of the sort that can follow a scien tific b reakthroug h. In dividual attitu des are sh aped by role models, prevailing social cu rrents and attitu des, profession al edu cation , socialization, practice styles, and the other life expe riences of the individual. The \" professi onal dominance\" view of the physician- patien t relationship1 is deeply rooted in the history of the medical p rofession and is cont inued by the proce ss of m edical educat ion and socialization into the professional role. Other heal th care pr ofessi onals, as a group, have differen t attitu des than physician s on certai n points, althou gh all h ealth care professionals h ave certai n attitu des in common.2 If the objec tives inc reased c ommunication a nd sha red decisionmaking are t o take ro ot in heal th care, som e reorientation o f attitu des will b e requ ired. Accord ingly, two possible means of influencing professional attit udes are d iscussed in this part of the Rep ort: decisions about which individuals are admitted into the health care professions, and the content (both explicit and i mplicit) of pr ofessional training. The importance of bo th selection criteria and c ontent of training has l ong been reco gnized. Indee d,the change s in medical educat ion following the fam ous Flexn er report in 1910 included no t only th e increase d orientation toward e mpirical science, 1 See, e.g., Eliot Freidson, PROFESSIO NAL DOMIN ANCE: THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF MEDICAL CARE, Aldin e Pub.

Yet Flexne r recognized that such developments we re but a necessary sta ge, not the end point, when he said: The reconstr uction of our medical education...is not goi ng to end matters o nce and for all. It leaves untouched certain outlying problems that will all th e more su rely co me into fo cus when the professional training of the physician is once securel y established on a scientifi c basis. At that m oment the s ocial role of t he physician will g enerally ex pand, and to supp ort su ch expansion, he will crav e a more lib eral d isinterested educatio nal experience.3 Thus, one direction for policy is to encourage t he recruitment and selection into pro fessional schools of individuals com mitted to, and likely to be skilled deliverers o f, humane care, with resp ect fo r patients and t heir values. A seco nd path would involve reinforcing those elements of professi onal educati on and s ocializatio n that are cond ucive to th e development of th e desired attitu des and to modify other elements that may be dest ructive. The Commissi on is con vinced that neither path is su fficient in itself. Efforts to recruit caring and humane individuals into professional schools are un likely to be fully successfu l if th e ed ucation al reg imen is n ot conducive to these values. Collaterally, giv en the cu rrent realities of professional training, it is unlikely that any reform effort s that might be adopted wou ld be able to transform the attit udes or reshape th e behaviors of existing professionals. Thus, a lthough the obstacles present on eac h path are reco gnized, th e Co mmissio n is in clined to reco mme nd movem ent along both. Selection Cri teria for Me dical School Some obse rvers have argued that the quickest and most effect ive way to turn out doctors of broadly hum ane sym pathies who are both committed to and skilled in communicatin g with p atients is to admit to medical sch ool more people lik ely to have such characteristics.4 While this strateg y is appealing in th eory, th ere is l ittle ev idence th at su ch individuals can b e read ily id entified , much less that the characteristics o f people 3 Abraham Flexner, MEDICAL EDUC ATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANAD A: A REPORT TO THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATI ON FOR THE ADVA NCEMENT OF TEACH ING, Bulletin No.4, Carn egie Foundation , New York (1910). 4 For a review of this argument and re levant data, see Carolin e L.

Current Standards . Admission to medical scho ol is a highly competitive process designed to sel ect students who are academ ically gifted and strongly committed to a caree r in medicine.

Even if ch anges in selection cr iteria were lik ely to prod uce the desired results, it is unclear whether such change s could be implemented. In respon se to criticis m of the Med ical Co llege Admission Test (MCAT) for its ex clusive em phasis o n cognitive sk ills,15the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) exp ended considerable effort between 1971 and 1976 tryin g to devise m easures of non cogn itive qualities th ought to be important to app lican ts' overall sen sitivity as physician s. C ompassio n, coping capability, d ecisio nmaking ability, relatio ns, sitivity in personal relations, and \"stayin g pow er\" were though t to be the most important qualities to assess. Ultimately, the AAMC decid ed it was not possible to devise valid measu res of these q ualities in a multiple-ch oice fo rmat for a national admissions t est and concl uded instead t hat such assessm ents are best m ade by admissions interviewers (and later b y clinical in structors). The C ommission c ommends t he subsequent efforts of the AAM C to help the professors in 500 departments in the medical school s improve methods to as sess the persona l qualities of st udents.16 A third sugg estio n for changes in admission criteria is th at a \"quick fix\" m ight be achi eved by adm itting to or cari ng roles (n otably wo men) or with characteristics th ought likely to improve sensitivity to ward the con cerns of minority groups and with the ability to communicate with patients \"in their own language\" ( blacks, Hispanics, and members o f other minority groups),17 The basis of such an 1955-76 , Assoc. of Amer.

It should be noted th at in m ost cases th e utility of thes e measures is be ing exam ined in relation to scho ol perform ance, not in re lation to the non technical aspe cts o f patient car e. 15 The MCAT is de signe d to assess stude nts' a bilities in four ma jor a reas: science knowled ge, prob lem-solv ing, r eading skills, and quant itative an alysis. 16 Testimon y of August Swanson, transc ript of the 19th meeting of th e President's Commission (April 3, 1982) at 114-18 . 17 Recent analy ses of applicatio n and enrollmen t in U.S. medical schools ove r roughly ten years have shown that wo men and ethnic minorities, historically underrepresen ted in th e medical prof ession, h ave b een admitted to medical school in incr easing numbers in an e ffort to increase eq uity of access. Applica tion and enrollm ent fig ures s how a 27% increase in total fem ale enrollment from 1974 to 1980. Women made up 27.8% of the 1 979-80 first- year medical school class. 134 Making Heal th Care Deci sions: Chapter 6 approach is t he idea that s ocial cla ss, gender, and ethn ic back ground are stronge r determ inants of attitudes and beha vior am ong m edical students than the training and professional socialization they receive in t heir form al acade mic careers . Although s ome differences do occur in the adm issions tests of women, racial/eth nic minorities, and the middle-class white males wh o are the predomin ant group o f app lican ts, th ere is lit tle ev idence of persisten t differen ces in attitu des or orientations in m edical sch ool. In fact, there see ms to be a conve rgence of attitudes and orientations as students progress through medical scho ol, thereby resul ting in relative homogeneity. In t erms of ul timate career pat terns an d res ponsiveness to patients, the re is also increasi ng evidence of converge nce between m ales and fem ales.18 Com bined De grees and Early Admission. As discussed ab ove, competitio n for ad mission to medical sch ool often has the unfortun ate conseque nce of na rrowi ng the range of courses stude nts feel free to ta ke at the undergraduate lev el, thereb y limiting exposure to disciplines other than scien ce an d lead ing to intense competitio n during college. Some limited attempts have been made to overcome these shor tcomings at the premedical lev el by admitting stud ents to medical sch ool earlier. Th e Commonweal th Fund's \"Interface Program\" in seven schools is the most noteworthy exa mple. Althoug h the program varies so mewhat, typ ically college a nd medical school are com pleted in six or seven years rather than ei ght. Students a re acce pted i nto the program after their sophom ore year of co llege, th ereby allev edical experie nce and enabling more stude nts to pursue se rious studies in the liberal arts rath er than in a narrow \" premed\" cur riculum. In addition, such programs allow for better in tegration of th e undergradu ate and m edical school curricula. In som e scho ols this red uces t he redundancy of scien ce cour ses (covered both in undergraduate edu cation and i n first-year medical scho ol), permitting st udents in their first year o f medical school to select c ourses in clinical medicine and t he social and behavioral scien ces. Although th ere is some concern that, once ad mitted to such a program, student s may stop st udying and may ultimately fail in medical scho ol, two eval uations concluded that these pr ograms allev iated competitio n and stress at bo th the undergradu ate and medical school Enrollm ent by racial an d ethn ic minorities (in cluding bla cks, Am erican Indi ans, Mexican Am ericans , and m ainland P uerto Ricans but ex cluding As ian Americans) cons titutes 8% of th e total m edical school enrol lment (up from 2.8% in 1970, but sho rt of the 12% g oal recommended b y the AAMC ). In short, th e gender, racial, and ethn ic ch aracteristics of m edical studen ts are be coming slightly less dominated b y white, middle-class males. See Assoc . of Ame r. Med.

Professional Behavior 135 levels, eased the tran sition between the two, and encouraged stud ents to pursue a broader array of cour ses.19 Innovations in Medical Education The Commiss ion recognizes th at th e first p riority in train ing physician s must be to impart sk ills n eeded to use the ever-ex panding body of biomedical kn owledg e and techn iques. In addition, it is aware that m edicine is a d iverse profe ssion with and resear chers, and t the re lative need of these p rofessio nals fo r tech nical an d interp erson al skills will vary. Consequently, th e ed ucation al goals at d ifferen t institutions and in differen t progra ms will d iffer. Neve rtheless, medicine is a \"hel ping profession,\" the primary purpose of which is to serve the needs o f patients. Few w ould suppo se that people who pursue careers in medicine are un interested in its h uman elements. An d yet the educat ion process oft en discourages t he development of caring attitu des by focusin g so much atten tion on technical competence a nd by failing to nurture (or, in s ome cases, eve n denigrating) the devel opment of the com passion and cari ng necessa ry to the practice of good m edicine.2OIf phy sicians have a n obligation to provide patients with a basis fo r effectiv e co mmu nication and decision making, they m ust learn to value this goal and acquire sk ills relev ant to it. Training stud ents to pr actice as hu mane and car ing physician s with an interest in serv ing rather than dominating patients is bo th an explicit and i mplicit proces s. Explicitly, student s may be t aught conce pts and skills in the classroo m or at the bed side. Implicitly, attit udes and values are learne d from role models and reward sys tems. If certain practices an d prece pts are preached in formal course work, but subse quently students neither observe th em in their ro le models no r are sp ecifically reward ed for practicin g them, they will q uickly learn that su ch con cepts an d beha viors are i n fact not highly valued.21 Therefore , in assessing medical education it is 19 Alfr ed Gellh orn, An Eva luative Report of th e Interface Progr ams Supported by the Commonwealth Fund, mime o.

Professional Behavior 137 every thing there is to know about medicine, m edical school s typically place trem endous em phasis on the memorization of facts. Although there is clearly a n eed to know a great d eal o f factual information, many critics contend that stu dents spend too much time memorizing and not eno ugh time learn ing problem-solving and observation skills.23Especially during the first two years of medical scho ol, intellectual thought may be stifled beca use the expectation (as re flected in e xaminations) is t hat students shou ld simply memorize and regurg itate facts rath er th an learn to apply informatio n and concepts to solving pro blems.24 Seco nd, many physicians and medical edu cators have noted that students spend relativ ely lit tle time learn ing med icine at th e bedside with \"wise old doctors.\" Instead, t heir role models typically are st udents and house officers with not much m ore ex perience t han the students have. The s ubtle influence s that seni or, experienced role models can ha ve in conveying atti tudes toward patients is illu strated in this account of a third-year m edical student's first exposure to patient care during his surgical \"clerksh ip\" at Un iversity Hosp ital in New York.

Whe n Dr. Spencer finally arrived, he turned out to be an amiable, soft-spoken man with a great econom y of gestu re. He was not at all distant with the students, bu t he was a gentleman in the old sense of the wo rd and so 23 There are nu merous articles in professional jo urnals such as J.A.M.

Perhaps m ost significantly, he t ranslated t he jargon of his profession into sim ple En glish. One patient, as a resu lt of an infection, had devel oped a sheath of scar tissue a round the heart. Dr. Spencer explaine d that the s heath had to be peeled away, as one would peel an orange, so the heart could expand and contract freely. The m ost striking thing Dr. Spe ncer did during rounds was kneel next to the bed of one patient who was in very bad shape, so that he could talk to him with their heads on the sam e level. The m an would not have to stare up, as though gazing into the heave ns. This may have been the single most gener ous act Aaro n had seen\u2014an d would see\u2014 during his clerkships; and one that went u nremarked.25 Moreover, due to the large number o f medical students, limited faculty, an d the need fo r clin ical train ing to occur in small groups, medical scho ols typically draw a s ubstantial proportion of their clinical teachers from the surr ounding comm unity.26 Control over what such part- time facu lty te ach, how it is tau ght, and the coherence and consisten cy of the material may b e limited.

A th ird problem derives from the fact th at typ ically eac h health profession carries out its own educational program in isolation from the others.

Unfortun ately, v ery little is known abo ut the effects of these courses upon th e attitu des and behaviors of ev en the self-selecte d fraction of medical students who take them. Standard examinations an d evaluations by students of t heir profess ors and c ourses only indicate what has been learn ed and lik ed, not whether attitud es and behaviors towards patient care ha ve been a ffected. Unlike clinical techniques, which can be directly obse rved and assesse d, the ultimate effect s of these teachings in the be havioral sciences have eluded direct study.37Ideally such effects would be as sessed over time, but such an evaluation would be com promised by uncontrolled and perhaps unidentifiable intervening variables. C ompensatin g for th e self -selectio n in su ch courses in itially would inv olve un desirable in terven tions (th at is, by artificiall y controlling admissio n to certain courses in th e behavioral scien ces an d the humanities). Finally, d evelopment of valid and reliab le mea- 37 In the Commi ssion's survey some significant differen ces wer e found between physicians who had some for mal training in ethics, law, and doctor- patient communication and those who h ad not. Ph ysicians with such training (especi ally in communication) were sign ificantly more likely than those without it to view patient part icipation in decisionmaking positive ly. They were a lso m ore likel y to report that th ey obtain ed consent from patie nts before proceeding with a variety of tre atments. However, in terms of inform ation disclosure , physicians wit h form al training i n ethics , law, an d com municatio n were s ome-what les s likel y to report that they routinely disclosed mo st items of information. Although this seems to contradict th e other findings, th ese physicians were possibly reflecting more carefully on the disclosure questi ons because of their training and wer e giving more hon est answers. Professional Behavior 143 sures of th e emp athic qualities th at the courses wo uld be seek ing to affect would be extremely difficult. Although th e im pact o f particu lar cou rses should be assessed, physicians' attitudes a nd behaviors are ultimately determined by the totality o f the ed ucational experience and n ot by any single co urse. Therefo re support for the values an d skills that stu dents are exposed to in such courses must co me from the entir e structure of m edical education if these c ourses a re to ha ve the desire d effect.38 The C ommission d oes n ot bel ieve t hat any one a pproach to physicians' basic medical educat ion should be ad opted while all others are di smissed.

However, since the Commissio n believ es that physician s are respon sible for ensuring that patients ca n participate as fa r as possible i n decisions about t heir care, medical ed ucators ought to train stud ents to carry out this ob ligation . Such education and training should not only equip students with necessary co mmunicatio n skills but also lead them to value th e patient as a full particip ant in medical decisio nmaking. This goal is m ore easily stated than accomplished. Indee d, there a re certain irreducible problems inhe rent in medical educat ion and i n being a physician. As a leading philosopher of m edical ethics ha s comm ented: \"[N]o am ount of change in medical educa tion or public education will solve the moral p roblems in med icine; at best it can merely in crease t he quality o f thoug ht that is brou ght to bear on them.\"39 While reco gnizing that ed ucation will n ot reso lve all the problems, the Co mmissio n agrees with Eric Cassell, a pro minent p hysician-ed ucator that: A do ctor who listens skillfully an d who is as carefu l with words as with drugs has th e basic too ls for the recog nition and relief of sufferi ng. Therefor e, training in 38 There is ext ensive li terature on the professional socialization of medical students that analyzes the effect of th e over all structur e on the development of attitudes and b ehaviors. One of the most difficult d ilemmas facing studen ts involves learn ing to main tain some emo tional distance from patients while being compassionate. See, e.g., Rober t K. Merton , George G.

Postgraduate Training. Residency level training p rovides an opportunity to reinforce an d synthesize th e skills and values learn ed in medical scho ol; indee d, som e believe that such training may be a n ideal time to teach the hum anities a nd ethic al analysis and t o refine interpersonal skills. Th e testi mony heard by th e Co mmis sion sugg ests that ph ysician roles in patient communication are sha ped very differently depending on the specialty. Resid ency trai ning in some specialties, most notably fam ily practice, re cogni zes the prim acy of the patient an d explicitly train s physicians to encourag e particip ation by patients in decision s, wh ile many of the hospital-based specialties d evote almost no training time to such issues.41Even in situations where patien t contact is limited and time is sh ort, communication is important; in fact, th ere is still more reaso n to train su ch physicians well in interperson al skills in order to make optimal use of the time they hav e with patients.

Carefu l consideration should be given to testin g students in this regard.43 The efforts of the American Board of Internal Med icine to incorporate th ese issues in to its resi dency trai ning programs and into its certificatio n examination shou ld prov ide valuable expe rience for leaders in other a reas of medicine who ar e trying to respon d to this important issue.44 In all of these areas of m edical education, fro m selectio n criteria to exam ination, the American Medical Association an d other professi onal bodies at the state and local leve ls conside rable influe nce.45 Therefo re, the Co mmissio n hopes that th ese g roups will g ive carefu l consideration to the reco mmen dations in this Repo rt in order to effect some neede d changes in m edical educ ation. Innovations in Nursing Education Like m edical educat ion, nursing e ducat ion is und ergoing major chan ges. Ironically, whi le medical educa tion is responding to social press ures to become \"more hum ane,\" nu rsing education is under pressure (from the health care delivery syste m and fro m with in the profession ) to becom e more \"scientific\" and m ore technologically so phisticated . Man y of the c hanges suggested in medical educa tion a re alrea dy an i ntegral part of p rofessio nal nursing education , which traditionally has placed great emphasi s on respect for patients' values, the therapeutic importance of patie nt participation in hea lth car e decisionm aking, and the teaching of good communicatio n skills.46 For n ursing, the more ur gent cha nges would 43 Although m ultiple-choice qu estions have been used in the contex t of case studies to ex amine th e proc ess of clin ical reasoning, they are probably not appropriate to measure compassion and th e humane practice of medicine.

This q uestion is cu rrently being studied in depth by the Nat ional Commission o n Nursing, a n independent commissio n that was estab lished with funds primarily fro m the Am erican Asso ciatio n, and that in cludes represen tatives from medicine, nursing, ho spital ad ministration, and other groups.48 In this sectio n of the Repo rt the Commissio n focuses on several ch anges in nursing education and pract ice that could have major c onsequences for the involvement of nurses in the inform ed cons ent proces s as well as for the nat ure of the relationship between care- givers in medicine an d nursing. Changes in Skills a nd Respo nsibilities. Nursing practice h as change d dramatically in the last 40 years . Increase d technology couple d with shifts in disease p atterns h ave led to a major rest ructu ring of th e health care delivery system . Recently , perhaps partly as a reflection o f the women's movem ent, the nursing professi on has becom e more assert ive and conce rned a bout being recognized i n its own right rather than as a mere ha ndmaiden t o medicine.49 These c hanges in practice and orientation have been accompanied by significant changes i n nursing educat ion. Two- and three-year diploma sch ools are being superceded by baccalaureate program s whose gra duate s are in turn increasingly goi ng on for advanced degrees.50 Trad itionally, n urses were ed ucated primarily to carry ou t physicians' orders regarding medications a nd treatments and to provide comfort and support to patients. Nurses today are pre pared in the direc t application of complex tech nologies to patient care.

With the shift in disease patterns toward chronic illn esses, nu rsing education has increased its lo ng-estab lished em phasis on the sk ills n eeded for educating patients, es pecially about self-c are techniques and the l ong- term managem ent of disease. Consumer dem ands for information and t he self-help and health promotion m ovem ents have also had their effects on nursing education. More than ever, nurses see t hemselves as patients' advocates\u2014assistin g patients to achieve better health and m ore-effective particip ation in th eir own h ealth care. 52 One of the stated functions in nursing c odes a nd st ate laws, often under the rubric of \"patient education,\" is t o prepare patients b y providing inform ation abou t their cond ared with the atten ding physician , who may specifically d elegate it to nurses, although it may be carri ed out independently by nurses i n the course of treatin g patients. When this is a sh ared or delegated functio n, nurses are responsible for following orders knowledgeab ly and for bringing er rors, om issions, and misunde rstandings on the part of patients to the atten tion of physician s. Although ultimate legal respon sibility v aries accord ing to the con text in wh ich care is delivered, the n ature of th e intervention, an d th e p erson treatin g the patien t, nu rses as a practical m atter typically have a central role i n the process of 51 Testim ony of Patrici a Balassone, tr anscript of 19th meeting of the President's Commission (April 3 , 1982) at 208-18. 52 This is reflected in ch anges in the code of n ursing ethics between 1950 and 1976 and in statements at nursing school s on th e philosoph y of nursing, which guide cu rricu lar developmen t.

By the 1960s, however, mirroring the trend in medicine, t he em phasi s in nurses' graduate educatio n shifted to wards mo re clin ical training and specialization in suc h area s as inte nsive care , pediatrics, ca rdiology, a nd orthopedics. With the nurse-practitio ner m ovement came a new aware ness by other health ca re prov iders a nd the public of t he clinical capabilities o f nurses.55Today nursing is moving to strengthen i ts role as a distinct profession, without trying to imitate medicine, and to specify more clearly the contri butions of nurs ing to patient care. As a profession , nursing is demanding more resp onsibility as well as m ore legal, m oral, a nd practical accountability.56 Rela tions hip to Medicine. With all these changes , professional nursing an d medicine ha ve becom e both more indepe ndent and more interdependent. On the one hand, nurses with graduate training and nurse-practitio ners (in cluding midwives) are in creasingly carin g for patients on their own. Especially in ambulatory settings a nd in nursing homes, nu rses may so metimes do checkups , chronic diseas e follow-up, and some management of acute d isease; th ey may order test s and initiate therapeutic in terventions, someti mes with a physician 's cosignature and other times indepe ndent of physicians.57In these cases nurses have full respon sibility for in forming patients abo ut their co nditions, treat ments, and t ests, for ens uring that the pat ient has understood the information, and for secu ring consent. In some areas, on the other hand, greate r interdepe ndenc e exists among health care pr ofessions, most notably in hospi tals.58As th e roles and functions of physicians and nurses overlap more, there i s an even greater n eed to coord inate patient care activ ities. Su ch co ordination requires that both professi ons understand each othe r's capabilities an d work together to foster p atients' well-b eing. In recogn ition of the need for co ordinated team practice, th e American Medical Ass ociation and the American Nurse s' Association estab lished the Joint Practice Commissio n, which 54 Id.; Teresa St anley, Nursing, in Warren T.

The C ommission further encourages joint training programs for students in the two professions, since most nurse s and physicians ultimately practice in teams. Only a few small ex periments have tried to train medical and nursing students together. More fre quently, student s of one profession have been taught by facul ty from the other or by teams of physician s and n urses. Th ere are m any logistical an d attit udinal barriers to joint trai ning, which seem to have curtailed the expan sion of such programs. Typically, it is not until residen cy train ing that physicians begin to appreciate n urses' sk ills and the need to coordinate p atient care activ ities. Alth ough the gesting that resid ency was th e optimal ti me to train physician s for tea m practice, others argue that earlier exposure of the two professions to one a nother is preferable. In the Commission's view, coordination and understanding among the various profession als facilitate o ptimal patient care an d the provision to patients of an effective b asis for particip ation in health care decisionmaking. M ore study by the professions a nd by Fede ral officials with respo nsibility for health care and educatio n is clearly n eeded. But enough is alr eady kno wn to recogn ize the value of the emphasi s placed by professional nursing on the educat ion and involvement of t he patient, as wel l as t he need for further efforts at joint training of nurses and physicians throughout their clinical prepa ration. 59 Guid elines fo r Establishing Joint or Collaborative Practic es in Hospitals, National Joint Practice Commissi on, Chicago (1981). Legal Reforms and Their Limitations 7 The Law as a Means of Im provement The la w has a n important function as a moral teache r, both for the professions and for the general publ ic. Even though they do not always give full effect to the value of self-determination, legal rules and court decisions rem ind society of i ts commit ment to this value.1Beyo nd this symbolic function, law est ablishes m inimum, enforcea ble standa rds for disclos ure that enable i njured patients to receive c ompensation for injuries cau sed by health professio nals' failure to meet these stan dards. Although the existen ce of this potential lia bility h as generated anxiety among practitione rs, it has al so spurred valuable reassess ment of ethical norms and p rofessi onal pra ctices and h as made pract itioners m ore sensitive to p atients' needs and exp ectations.2The Com mission firmly believes t hat the law ca n and should continue to perform these esse ntial functions. The Co mmission appreciates th e practical d ifficu lties o f adopting its approach to patient-professional relationships as 1 See Jay Katz, Informed Consent\u2014A Fairy Tale?: Law's Vision, 39 U.

A s discussed i n Chapter F our, these aspects are genera lly viewed as benef icial to the doc tor- patient rel ationship because t hey tend to provoke discussion, enhan ce understanding on the par t of both doctor and patient, lead to better decisions, and aid com pliance. 152 Making Heal th Care Deci sions: Chapter 7 the normative legal expectatio n for informed consent. Tran scend ing these practical d ifficu lties is a more fu ndamen tal issu e: the Co mmissio n is not convinced that its v ision of the patient-professional relatio nship can be achieved primarily th rough relian ce on the law.3Having analyze d the relatio nship in a way th at reco gnizes th e complexities and variation s of individual cases, the Commission is aware that the inform ed consen t process m ay not be susceptible to detailed regulation by so bl unt an instrument as t he law of battery or of m edical negligence. Indee d, the Commission is concerned that efforts to draw the law further into regulating the subtler aspects o f relatio nships between patients and health care pro fessionals m ay prove in effectiv e, burdensome, and ultimately counterproductive.4 3 One obstacle to the implementation of the Commission's visi on through law is the difficu lty of form ulating an a ppropriat e means of enforcem ent. W hen a health care prof essional does not engage in eth ically proper discussion with a patient, and the failur e to do so causes no bodily harm to the patient, the amount of damages to which the p atient w ould be en titled are nom inal, and thus few if an y patients (and law yers) would be willing to brin g suit under such circum stances. Instead of relying on tr aditional litigation to implem ent th e Com mission's vision, [t]his could be achieved b y establis hing a system of non-insur able tort- fines for violation of the duty to di sclose and a compensation f und. The fines would be paid in to the fu nd, which would be used to compensate those persons the legislatur e def ines as injured by nondisclosure. Under this arrangemen t doctors are provide d with guidance and ar e subject to specific det errence. Al l physicians who violate a duty to disclose would be li able for fines that could be set in a ccord ance with their d eterren ce objec tive. those p atients suffering injury, as d efined by the legislature, would be compensated.

Most fundam entally, the law could em phasize the process of continuing communication and deci sionmaking, rat her than the pr o form a disclosure of particular risk s that now stri kes many practitio ners as a hollow c harade.5Such a shift in foc us would m ake clear that a professional's obligation is not satisfied\u2014and the professional is not insulated from leg al liability\u2014si mply by obtaining the patient's signature on a conse nt form.6Instead, c ourts coul d engage in a more qualitativ e evaluation of th e entire p rocess that wou ld acco unt for the profession al's overall effort t o elicit matters of particular co ncern to th e patien t and to respo nd to the p atient's worries, insofar as reason ably possible, through disclosure and discussion. Inst ead of focusing, as i s now t he case , on whethe r the In Tex as, info rmed consent is leg ally govern ed b y a set of detailed regulations describing what doctors are supposed to disclose for particular procedures . See 3 Tex. Reg . 4293-96. \u00a7\u00a7 319. 01.03.001.- .003 (Dec. 12 , 1978), issued pursuant to Tex . Rev. Civ. St at. Ann. art. 4590i, \u00a7 6 .03 (Vernon Cum. Supp. 1980). The limitations o f law in re gulation of the r elationship between doctors and patients is well developed by Fox an d Swazey in th eir discussion o f the famous hear t transplant case of Karp v. C ooley , 493 F.2d 408 (5th Cir. 1974). See Ren\u00e9e C. F ox and Judith P . Swazey, THE COURAGE TO F AIL: A SOCIAL VIE W OF ORG AN TRANSPLANT S AN D DI ALYSIS, Univ. of Chicago Press, Chicago (1974) at 201 et seq. 5 The r equirement of informed consen t has frequently been described b y physicians as a my th or a fiction. See, e.g., Henry K. Beecher, Consent in Clinica l Experimenta tion\u2014Myth and Reality, J. Burnham, Medica l Experimenta tion on Humans, 152 SCIENCE 44 8 (1966); William P. Irvin, \"Now , Mrs. Blare, 102 (1963); E ugene G. Laforet, The Fiction o f Informed Cons ent, 235 J.A.M.A. 1579 (1976); to Absurdity , 101 MED. TIMES No. 9, 164 (1973). The ar ticles critical of in formed consent appear to have diminished in frequency in the last few years. 6 See note 44, Chapter One supra. If inform ed cons ent is viewed as a proces s\u2014 as this R eport envisions\u2014rather th an as an even t, proposals to embod y \"informed consent\" in a written or \"electron ic\" docum ent are ult imately unavailing.

REV. 241 , 273- 81 (1978). 154 Making Heal th Care Deci sions: Chapter 7 practitio ner warn ed the patient of risk s, cou rts would inqu ire i nto whether or no t the practitio ner took sufficien t step s to involve the patient in the decisionm aking proc ess. The questions before t he court could include, for exa mple, wh ether the practitio ner m ade reaso impart informatio n, to determin e wh ether the patient und erstood it, to elicit th e patient's values an d pref erences, to c reate a nonc oercive atmosphere for the decision, and t o encourage the patient to decide on the basis of the avai lable information an d the patient's own values.7 Efforts t o translate the Commissi on's re commendations of et hical norms for the communicatio n process d irectly in to detailed legal rules may create evid entiary difficu lties. To th e extent that the issu es to be examined in a lawsu it wou ld be more subtle an d subjective than they currently are if th e Co mmis sion's reco mmen dations were to form the ethical basis of law, proof of what occurred would be comp licated. Of course, the direct testimony of both professional and patient could provide acc ounts of the decisionmaking process. Yet as discusse d in Chapter One, the ten dency of su ch testi mony to be selectiv e and self- serving familiar an d difficu lt to overcome.8Docum entary evide nce could be i ntroduce d as wel l, but the production o f a full documentary record reflectin g not merely a fo rmal written consent but the en tire process of communication and decisionmaking over an extended time would impose su bstantial burdens. Of particular concern would be the time needed to gene rate and e nsure the acc uracy of s uch records from the viewpoints of al l parties. The implicatio n to be drawn from these d ifficu lties is no t, however, that professionals sh ould com ply with the limited requirements of the law, an d then go abou t their bu siness as they see fit. T he Commission rejects t he attitu de that divides obligation s into two categories: th ose th at are l egally established and must be o beyed under pain of penalty, and those t hat are not so established a nd hence can b e ignored. Throughout this Report t he Commission has em ployed the 7 Sever al curren t dilem mas in inf ormed consent law would remain problematic in this view. F or example, wh at causal relationship needs to be established b etween the professiona l's failure to pro vide a b asis for effec tive p articipation and th e physical injur y associated with trea tment? When the p rofessional's failure to provide such a basis did not result in ph ysical inju ry to the pa tient, there would be no readi ly ascertainab le monetary damages to serve as a basis fo r redress (or to encourag e an attorney to take th e cas e on a cont ingent-f ee bas is). A s tandard for money damages to redr ess di gnitar y injuries may be n eeded , or the governmental and voluntar y organizations that regulate licensure and cer tification m ay need to investigate alleg ations of s ystematic viol ation of patients' rights, as a ground for professional d iscipline. 8 See pp. 25-26 supra. Legal Reforms and Limitations 155 terminology of \"profession al-patien t relatio nships\" rather th an the language of the marketplace, whic h treats patients as \"c onsumers,\" to unde rline the i mportance of recapt uring a sense of profe ssional norm s and obligations. Suc h norm s are more than gratuitous a dvice; they are to be taken se riously, both by individual professionals and by their organizations.9 In distinguishing between a strictly leg al obligation to secu re consent and a pr ofessional's broader o bligation to provide patients with a basis for effectiv e particip ation in d ecisionmaking, th e Co mmissio n hopes to remind health care profession als that th eir obligations transcend legal requ iremen ts and incorporate ob jectives th at the law can not read ily enforce. The roots of the broader obligation are et hical and resi de with the mutual trust an d expectatio ns that are appropriate for parties to the relatio nship. Th e Co mmissio n believes that recog nition and fulfillm ent of these pro fessio nal obligations by health care p ractitio ners will g o a long way toward allev iating the sometimes ad versary ch aracter th at has encroached up on pat ient-professional relationships in recent years an d will reinforce the mutual trust on which successful rela tionships are ultimately founded. Enhancing Self-Determination of the Formerly Compet ent In add ition to any jud icial m odificatio n in the law of consent to bring it in to line with the Commiss ion's con clusions, states shou ld direct legislativ e atten tion to giving patients the mean s to have at least so me say about trea tment decisions in th e event they bec ome incapa ble of particip ating in d ecision s directly.10 More than one-third of th e public in the Commission 's survey have gi ven instructions (t hough o nly one- quarter of those are in writing ) to someone about how th ey wo uld like to be treated if they becom e too sick to make decision s themselv es. While this issu e has gained prominence larg ely because of the atten tion recently accorded to so-calle d living wills for dying patie nts, pe ople ca n and do set forth instructions to guide a wi de vari ety of heal th care decisions. As di scussed in Chapter Two, such means wo uld perm it two of the goals of self-determin ation to be fulfilled : individualizing the meaning of well-being and showing res pect for personal dignity. The third goal\u2014 that a patie nt be an acti ve 9 Indeed, althou gh the broad general ities of batt ery and m alpractice law, whi ch aim largely at redressing past misconduct, may not be helpfu l here, the rules spelled out b y hospital boards, medical societies, and licensin g bodies could provide more detailed pros pective guid ance and encouragem ent. 10 Standards and procedures for assessing which pat ients are incap able of participating in a health care decision are discussed in Ch apter Eig ht infra . 156 Making sions: Chapter 7 agent in deci sions about his or he r ow n care\u2014would be impossi ble to achieve at all in the case of an unconscious patient and im possible t o achieve fully with patients who are less seriou sly in capacitated. Although this Report focuses on patients' direct decisions about their own care , no discussi on of legal refo rms would be com plete without some attention to how a person's informed consent might carry forward to a time when he or she is no longer ab le to particip ate d irectly th rough the use of written direction s (known as \"advan ce directiv es\") p repared in anticipation of some future incap acitatin g illness. Without changes in the law, the prob lem facing a person who wants to direct the care he or she will r eceive if incom petent is that the authorization provide d to a family member or physician ceases to be legally effectiv e at ju st th e time when it is n eeded, namely wh en the person bec omes incom petent, because of the legal rule (whic h is quite sensible in other con texts) that an ag ent's au thority is termin ated by incom petence appo inted th at ag ent.11Thus, s pecial provision must be m ade if a person's directions a bout medical care, set down while he or sh e is competent, are t o be eff ectiv e in determin ing, or even officially guiding , the d ecisio ns actu ally made if th e person becom es incom petent. Instruc tion Directives. Two types o f advance di rectives ha ve already bee n recognized by som e states: ins truction directi ves and prox y rectives. The best kn own exam ples of the first type are the \"nat ural death\" statutes t hat have been enacted i n 14 st ates since the first was a dopted in 1976 in California.12 These s pecify certain circum - stances unde r whic h a directive to a treating phy sician (the wo rding of which is usually set fo rth in the statu te) wil l be effective in limiting the extent of life-su staining treat ment administered t o a patient whose condition has been d iagnosed as immin ently fatal.

Legal Reforms and Limitations 157 wish to have \"standing orders\" about some aspect of their care (such as no blood transfusions). Instructions could authorize the use o f cert ain types of t reatments, as i n the case of p eople diagnosed as havi ng progressive se nile dem entia of the Alzheimer's type w ho, before they becom e incompetent, give their perm ission for resea rch procedures of more than minimal risk . And rath er than specifyin g that under particular circum stances an individual does or do es not authorize a particula r type of medical in tervention, instruction s could describ e a person's attitu rd a partic ular state of affairs.13 Whet her t he instructions are quite precise or very general , for several reasons an a dvance directive of this type is of limited use i n providing effectiv e self-d eterm ination. First, it wo uld be extremely difficu lt to draft a d irectiv e that did not leave considerable range fo r interpretation; bot h the ex istence of t he circum stances making t he directiv e effectiv e and the steps to be taken under it will o ften require discretion by health care professio nals and fa mily. Second , if the term s of the docum ent were m ade m ore precise in order t o leave the choices m ore with the patient and less wi th the treatin g profession als, th e rang e of circum stances t o whi ch the document wou ld appl y would ha ve to be narrowed or its length and complexity would have to be increased . 13 An ex ample o f such a directive would b e one stating : \"I feel that I would r ather not live than r emain in an unconscious state fro m which I have no likelihood of recover ing.\" Th is might provide a clearer sense o f a person's feelings and wishes than a directive that merely specifies the treatm ent a person does or does not w ant under certain circumstances. 158 Making Heal th Care Deci sions: Chapter 7 Third, and perhaps most important in light of the analysis of inform ed cons ent containe d in this Report, in struction d irectiv es are likely to addre ss onl y a limited ra nge of m edical situations t hat occur frequently enou gh to be of general con cern to people. Beyo nd these, a directive would itself be a n exam ple of knowing an d voluntary self- determination onl y if it emerged f rom a pat ient-professional relationshi p in which the patient had been cou nseled ab out the futu re risk of a particular disability an d abo ut the courses o f treatm ent that wou ld probably then be a vailable. Eve n then, deci sionmaking under an instruction has a trun cated quality sin ce the p atient will h ave dictated specific decisi ons before all the partic ulars of the situ ation were clear an d before the process of m utual par ticipation and s hared decisionm aking had fully ripened. Consequently, suc h directives are l ikely to be m ore useful in e xcluding certain procedur es that are totally una cceptable to a patient than in fine-tuning decisionmaking about a ful l range of possible health ca re choices. Proxy Directi ves.14 An altern ative typ e of directiv e, which wou ld avoid the difficulties bo th of an ticipating all p ossible treat ment choices and of leaving ful l discret ion t o heal th care pro fessionals, would designate a person as aut horize d to m ake treatm ent decisions on a patient's be half under s pecified circum stances.15 Both th e rang e of circum stances in which t he proxy m ay act a nd the range of choices he or she i s authorized t o make could be broad or narrow. For e xample, a person who wanted vigorous treatment could authorize a proxy to make all necessary decisio ns, sub ject o nly to the req uirement that all therapies be aggressi vely pursued if t hey offered any possibility o f benefit. Although a proxy's decisions are no t directly acts o f the patient, proxy directives m eet the ob jective of all owing patients to limit wh at happens to them if they appoin t proxies with whom they have discussed their v iews and who are willin g to insist on treatm ent decisio ns that are consisten t with those v iews. Th e prox y can participate in the process of share d decisionmaking in the patient's stead, so that t hat process is 14 The term \"surrogate \" is used in this repo rt (see Chapter Eight infra) to designate an agent au thori zed t o make a h ealth car e decision on behalf of a patient who lac ks the capac ity to do so personall y. W ithin this ry, a \"proxy \" is a surr ogate appoin ted by a patient. 15 In the context of th e presen t discussion, the triggering event u nder a directive designating a pr oxy would be (at the leas t) that the signer had be come incapab le of particip ating in d ecisions about his or her own car e. Dir ectives cou ld, in theor y, des ignate a prox y to step into the decisionmaking shoes of a person wh o remained capable of mak ing his or he r own choices but who chos e not to . Legal Reforms and Limitations 159 not artificially trun cated . The degree to which this prox y pro cess actu ally substitu tes fo r a p atient's direct p articipatio n depends upon how extensively th e patient had previously talk ed over the relevan t issues with health professionals. By co mbining a pr oxy directiv e with specific in structions, an individual could co ntrol bot h the co ntent and the pr ocess o f decisionm aking about care in case of incapacity. Th e use of instruction s would help overcom e the open-ended nature of de signating a pr oxy by increasing the likelihood that in the pro cess o f deciding on instruction s a person would have discussed rel evant considerations with both the potential p roxy an d the health care pro fessio nals\u2014i n other words, that the person would go through a process of prospective informed co nsent. The possibility o f ap pointing a proxy fo r health care decisionm aking already e xists in the la ws of 37 states th at have adopted statutes aut horizing w hat is usually termed a durable power of attorney.16 Although these w ere fashioned ov er the past 30 years p rimarily to provide a les s expensive means than court-ordered guardianship or conserv atorsh ip for dealing with small property in terests, there is no thing in the acts th at wo uld explicitly p reclude the use of durable powers of attorney to designate or in struct a proxy to make health care decisions.

Inaddition to the ex isting statu tes th at provide a means for patients to creat e one t ype of ad vance directive or another, several model statutes ha ve been proposed specifically to allow such directiv es in health care.18 In evaluating existing or proposed m eans or in devising new ones, several fact ors need to be taken into account. Four groupings of such considerations are prese nted here to suggest the range of issues the Commission bel ieves s hould be addressed in evaluating stat utory alternatives. Requisites fo r a valid directive . Speci al attention needs t o be gi ven to the basic req uisites for a valid directiv e, particularly since so me of the statutes that might be em ployed\u2014s uch as the dura ble power of attorne y acts\u2014were no t designed specifically fo r the appointment of proxy health care decisionmakers . Deci sionmaking ca pacity of principal: There should be some way to estab lish that a person filling out a d irectiv e (the prin cipal) was leg ally competent to do so at th e time. The em phasi s of t his Report (as di scussed in Chapters Three a nd Ei ght) is on p atients posses sing deci sional capacity rather than on legal com petence. Shoul d a statute insist tha t when a directive is exec uted the pers on has the cap acity to understand the choice embodied in the directive? To ce rtify a signat ory's ca pacity, statutes oft en require one or two witnesses to a document. It would see m advisa ble for a statute to be c lear on whether the witn esses must attest to the principal's capaci ty or erely serve as fraudulent signat ures. Since h witnes ses are likely to be layp eople, the stand ard of decision making capacity th ey app ly will rest on common sense, not psychological expe rtise. Due regard for the step being taken: Th e related con cern that every one i nvolved i n the execution of a directive, particularly the principal and the pros pective proxy, recognize the seriousness of the step is som ething that would be m ore di fficult to guarantee by statute. It is, however, a consideration that arises in evaluating the wisdom of using existing durable- power statutes, wh ich were in tended to ad dress only property matters. On e way to increase t he likelihood that due regard is given to the subject matter would be to provide that before a 17 Lega l Problems of the Aged and Infirm\u2014The Durable Power of Attorney \u2014 Planned Protective Servic es and the Living Will, 13 REAL P ROPERTY, PROBATE AND TRUST JOURNAL 1, 2-4 , 35-36, 41 (Spring 1978). 18 Yale Law School Legislativ e Services Proj ect, MEDICAL TREATMENT DECISION AC T, Society for the Right to Die, New York (1981) at \u00a7 3; UNIFOR M HE ALTH CARE CONSENT ACT, National Conference o f Commissioners on Uniform State Laws , New York (1982) at \u00a7 6; UNIFORM RIGHT TO RE FUSE TREATMENT ACT, C oncern for Dying, Chi cago (Dr aft, May 1982) at \u00a7\u00a7 3-5. Legal Reforms and Limitations 161 directive is executed, the pri ncipal (and proxy, where one is involved) must have ha d a discussion with a health care professional of the patien t's objectives and of the directiv e's potential con sequences. Th is would also help ensure that any inst ructions reflect a process of active self-determination on the part of the patient-to-be. Legal effect of directives . Several questions arise about the effects that a d irectiv e should have in th e law and about how these effects m ight be ac hieved. Registratio n: Certain docum ents are offi cially registered, so tha t they will no t be ig nored and so there can b e no doubt that all co ncerned parties are aware of their e xistence. The process of re gistration also provides an opportunity to ensure th at all th e basic documentary requisites ha ve been met; for exam ple, an official who is cha rged with registering directives coul d be t rained to determ ine the competence o f signers. On the other hand, the additional formality of required registration might seriously discourage the use o f directives, a nd it is doubtful whether in this contex t\u2014un like in a comm ercial or real estate settin g\u2014there is really much need for a d irectiv e to be o n file in a governmental office in order for it to have its desi red effect at the time it would be needed. Legal immunity: A statute should m ake clear that pe ople acting pursuant to a directiv e are not sub ject to civil or crim inal liability fo r any action they take that they would not be liable for were they acting on the direct consent of a com petent patient. Yet sin ce directiv es\u2014particu larly those including instruction s\u2014may contain unavoidable ambiguities, some leeway must be offered if th is leg al immunizatio n is to provide adequate reass urance for heal th care professio nals. So me of the existing statutes spea k of protection for actions taken in \"good faith.\"19Language of this sort provides se nsible protection for subsidiary health pers onnel who follow the orders of the physician in charge of the pat ient, provided they believe the physician's orde rs are in line with the directiv e or have been authorized by a proxy. So me standard of reason able interpretatio n of the directive may need t o be imposed, however, on an at tending physician's rea ding of the document, lest \"good faith\" offer too wide a scope for discretion. Suc h a st andar d might best be de veloped in case law and scholarly co mmentary rath er than in the statu te itself. Penalties fo r noncompliance: In order t o make directives leg ally binding, several states h ave inclu ded penalties in their 19 See Ala. Code \u00a7 22-8A-7 (Supp. 1981); Del. Code Ann. tit. Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 Or. \u00a7 97.065 (1981); Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 70.122.0 50 (West 1982).

If health care providers a re unwilling to share respon sibility with patients and, in particular, tend to overtreat p atients whose physical o r mental co ndition leav es them unable to resist, t hen\u2014 unless they are made legally binding\u2014advance di rectives are unlikely to protect effectiv ely p atients who want to limit th eir treat ment. On the other hand, if health care p rofessionals are simply unsure of what patients want, or if t hey are anx ious to share decisio nmaking respo nsibility b ut are app rehensiv their legal liab ility if they fo llow th e instructions of a person whose decisi onmaking capacity is in doubt, then the threat o f penalties would be unnecessary . Indeed, it c ould e ven be counterproductive if it fo stered an adversarial relationship between patient and provider. Prox y's cha racteristics a nd authority . Several speci al questions arise in the context of health care concerning who m ay act as a proxy and what the proxy may do. Com petency of the proxy : The basic consi deration about a proxy is that he or she shoul d have the capac ity to mak e a particular h ealth care decision whe n neede d. The means fo r ass uring this capacity are not s o simply stated , however. Basically, th ey would seem to be the sam e ones that are app lied to patients themselves, as discussed in Chapter Ei ght.21 Disqu alification s: Anot her i ssue, which could also be treated as a prerequisite for appointing a proxy, conce rns whether limitations s hould be pl aced on who may serv e. The m ain consi deration is to avoid the appointment of anyone with in terests that are adverse to a patient's. In some \"nat ural deat h\" expl icit excl usion of anyone financially involved (as debtor, c reditor, or heir) wi th the pat ient.22 Speci al conce rn may also be warranted for patients in nursing homes.23 Unfortunately, in the a bsence of a s pecial 20 Cal.

An instruction directiv e, whether by itself o r joined with a proxy di rective, creates the potential for deci sions based upon the particular (and perhaps idiosyncratic) wish es of the patien t. The interpretatio n of such a directiv e would seem to lie with the surrogate decisionm aker, pa rticularly in t he case of a proxy designated by the patie nt, at least in t he first instance. Provision m ay have to be made, of course, for an administrative mechanism to decide situat ions i n whic h a health care professional challenges the decision of a proxy on the gro und that it is not based on the patient's best in terests o r on a reason able in terpretatio n of th e patient's instructions. Administrative aspects . Several proce dural conce rns probably need to be addresse d in any statute for advance d health care directives. Triggering event: A statute nee ds to specify how a directive becom es effect ive. T wo sets of conc erns are invol ved. T he first, alrea dy mentioned, relates to the necessary guarantee that the directive re flects the wish es of th e patient. Some o f the \"natural deat h\" acts, for exam ple, require t hat a directive m ust be exe cuted afte r the patient has been inform ed of a diagnosis, so that the patient's instruction s are arriv ed at in the context of the actual, not h ypothetical, c hoices t o be m ade.26 Statutes also typically p rovide that the designation of a surrogate or t he content o f speci fic instructions be renewed eve ry few y ears so that the signatory can reconsider the instructions or desi gnation i n light of cha nged circum stances or opini ons.27Once it is d etermined that a directiv e is valid, a se parat e issue nee ds to be a ddresse d: what makes it operative? A statute may lea ve that question to t he document itself, to be specified by the person executing the directiv e. Or it may p rovide that a p articular event or condition bri ngs t he doc ument into play. In eith er case, the triggering event will requ ire bo th a st andardfor actio n and a specification of who will mak e the determination.

The theory of sel f-determination suggests t hat as long as t he pri ncipal re mains com petent, he or s he should unquestionabl y have the power to revoke a di rective. But what about a n incompetent (incapacitated) person? The \"natural death\" acts have uniformly provided that any revocation by a principal negates a directive.28 In the context of termination of l ife-sustaining treatment, that resul t may be sensi ble, since it would general ly seem wrong to cease such treatm ent based u pon a proxy's orders whe n a pat ient, no matter how co nfused, asks t hat treatment be cont inued.

In som e circum stances the revie w mechanism need only judge the pro cess by which a deci sion has been reached. In ot her circ umstances it may seem advisable to re view the health care decision itself, which in turn may involve ei ther a su bject ive or an objectiv e approach to the patient's well- being. In the absence of a special p rovision in the statu te, qu estion s of this so rt would lead to revie w by institutional bo dies and, e ventually, to judicial proceedi ngs.

Altho ugh the issu e has received particula r public atte ntion in the context of term inal illness,29 it is not limited to that settin g, and there are go od reason s to treat the entire subject of advance directives within a single statute. Without endorsing any particular statute, the Commission doe s endorse the devel opment of ad vance directives and e ncourages patients and profe ssionals to use t hem as appropri ate whether or not the re is a specific statute that re gulates and e nforces thei r use. 29 Indeed, the subject r eceives further attention from the Com mission in its forthcoming r eport on d eciding about life-sustain ing ther apy. IV Incapacity This Repo rt deals p rimarily with decisionmaking about health care when patients pos sess t he capacity to make their ow n decisions. Si nce adults typically are abl e to decide am ong most medical alternatives most of the tim e\u2014a fact reflected in th e legal presum ption of com petence \u2014 treatment decisio ns are u sually made with little if an y atten tion to whether or not a p atient is in capacitated . When the patient is n ot incapacitated, t here a re no si gnals to ra ise the issu e, which is as it sh ould be. A lthou gh data do not exist abou t the prevalence of decision al incapacity, th ere is reason to believe that the problem is quite sm all. Yet when the iss ue does a rise i t can greatly com plicate decisionm aking, especially whe n the conse quences of a decision are signific ant. In the final Part o f this Rep ort, th e Co mmission turns b riefly to a number of important issues rai sed by the problem of decisional incapacity: Who is in capacitated? What p rinciples gov ern decisionmaking make deci sions for pat ients? what review of such deci sions is necessa ry and appropriate ? Who Is Incapacitated and How Is It To Be Determined? 8 One of th e co nditions fo r health care decision making is th e capacity to make s uch decisions , as de scribed in C hapter Three. T he compone nts of deci sional capacity were delineated there as possession of a set o f values and goals, the ability to communicate a nd understan d information, and the ability to reason and delib erate. This Ch apter g oes beyond t hat concept ual fram ework t o discuss more fully three aspects o f incapacity: th e identificatio n of those who are in capacitated ,1the m eans for m aking suc h asse and the rel ationship between profession als, i nstitutions, and the state in th is process. Identification of Incapacity In light of the presumption that most patients have t he capacity to make heal th care decisions, on what grounds might a pe rson be found to lack such a cap acity ? Three g eneral criteria h ave been followed : the outcome of t he deci sion, the status or category of the patient, and the patient's functional ability as a d ecision maker. 1 The term s \"incapac ity\" and \" incapa citated\" as used in this Report are s horthand labels for patie nts who lack the capa city to make a particu lar heal th car e decision , as described in Chapter Thre e. These terms are not sy nonymous with either mental or physical d ecision al mental or infirmity, all perso ns with such infirm ities are not ipso fac to \"incapacitated\" as that term is used here. 170 Making Heal th Care Deci sions: Chapter 8 The outcom e approac h\u2014which the Com mission expressly rejects2\u2014bases a determination of incapacity prim arily on the con tent of a pat ient's dec ision. U nder t his standa rd, a pat ient who makes a heal th care decisi on that reflects values not widely hel d or that rejects conventional wisdom abou t proper health care i s found t o be incapacitated . Using the status approach, certa in categori es of patients have traditionally been deemed incapable of making t reatment deci sions without reg ard to their actu al capabilities.3 Som e of the se categories of patients\u2014such as t he unconscious\u2014c orrespond closely with actual incapacity. But o ther patients wh o are presu med to be incap acitated on the basis of their status may act ually be capable of making particular health care decisions. Many older children, for example, can make at least so me health care de cisions,4 mildly or moderately retard ed individuals hold understandable preferences about health care, a nd the same may be true in varying degrees among psychotic persons. The thi rd approach t o the determination of i ncapacity focuses on a n individual's act ual functioning in deci sionmaking si tuations rather than on the individual's st atus. This approach is particularly germ ane f or children above a cert ain age (variously described as from seve n to mid- teens).5 For exa mple, rather t han considering children under th e age of majority in competent to decide unless they co me with in one of the except ions created by the statutory and c ommon law, these patients could be re garde d as com petent unle ss s hown to lack decisionm aking capacity.6 Simi larly, a sen ile person may have 2 See p. 61 supra. 3 See Loren H.

See also Thomas Grisso, JUVENILES' WAIVER OF R IGHTS\u2014LEGAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPETENCE, Plenum Press, New York (1981). 6 Law has traditionally viewed people under a specified age\u2014 long set at 21 years and more recently at 18\u2014as preclude d fro m making decisions about any contractual matters, in cluding their own h ealth care. In effect, there h as been a presumption of incompeten cy, contrar y to the usu al presumption of competency accord ed adul ts. Some exceptio ns of a loos ely functiona l nat ure have be en created for \" emancipa ted\" or \"mature \" minors, in recogn ition that som e children under some circumstances in fact ha ve the capacity to make h ealth Determ ining Incap acity 171 been declare d incom petent by a co urt and a gu ardian may have bee n appointed to man age the person's fin ancial affairs, bu t the fun ctional standard would not foreclose the need to determin e wh ether the sen ility also ne gated the individual's capaci ty to makehealth care de cisions. What is relevant is whether som eone i s in fact capa ble of making a particular deci sion as judged by the consistency between the person's choice and that individual's underlying values an d by the extent to which the choice promotes the individual's well-being as he or she sees it. The Co mmissi on reco mmends that determin ations of in capacity b e guided l argely by the functional approach, that individuals not in certain basic categories (s uch as unde r the age of 14, grossly retarde d, or comatose) sh ould be assu med to possess decisionm aking capacity until they dem onstrate otherwise, and t hat incapacity shoul d be found to exist only wh en people lack the ability to make decisio ns that promote their well-being in conformity with their own previously expressed val ues an d preferences.7 The fact that a patient belo ngs to a category of pe ople who are often unable to make ge neral care decisions and that fo r reasons of social po licy such d ecisions ought to be sufficien t. Th is system, bas ed .on a genera l rule of incom petenc e with an ever- expanding num ber of statu tory excep tions, h as meant that children ar e more often presumed competent to make health care d ecisions, or h as at least brough t about an implicit lower ing of the age of presu med incompetence. See A. M. Capron, The Competence of Children as Self-Deciders in Biomedica l Interventions , in Willard Ga ylin and Ruth Macklin, eds. , WHO SPEAKS FO R THE CHILD, Plenum Press, New York (1982) at 57-114. The Commissio n endorses this general tr end, recognizing that there is an age, below about 14 y ears old, at which the tradition al presumption o f incom petence st ill ough t to go vern. The presum ption, however, is m erely a starting point f or inquir y. Ev en when children lack the capacity to make decisions, their involvemen t in th e decisionmaking process not only acknowledg es th eir ind ividual status but also may enhance th eir cooperation i n and com plianc e with therapeu certain interv entions, a pract itioner sho uld obt ain bo th the consen t of a child 's leg al guardian and the assent of the child. The l atter would be insuffi cient b y itself to authorize the intervention, but th e interv ention co uld not go ahead without it. Cf. National Commission for the Pr otection of Human Subjects of Biomedical an d Behavioral Res earch, REPORT AND RECOM MENDATION S: RESEARCH INVOLVING CHILDREN, Government Pr inting Office, Washington (1977) a t 5-19. 7 When efforts to communicate with a patient and learn his or her preferences would jeopardi ze the p atient's well- being b ecaus e of an urgent need fo r treatment, it is appropri ate for heal th care providers to treat the p atient as incap acitated an d to turn to a sur rogate d ecision maker or, when none is availab le, to care for th e patient withou t consen t, as p ermitted by the \"emergenc y\" excep tion. See g enerally 172 Making Heal th Care Deci sions: Chapter 8 decisions for their own well-being or t hat an individual makes a hi ghly idiosyncratic decisio n should alert h ealth care profe ssional s to the greater possibility o f decision al incapacity. But it does not conclusively reso lve the matter. Rarely\u2014ag ain, th e unconsciou s patient is the m ain exception\u2014will incapacity b e absolute. Ev en people with impaired capacity u sually still possess so me ability to comprehend, to commu nicate, an d to form and express a p referen ce. In such cases, ev en when ultimate d ecisio nal authority is not lef t with a patient, reasonable ef forts should be made to give the person relevant information ab out the situation and the available options and to solicit and accommodate his or her preferences. Asse ssment s of Incapacity The objective of any assessm ent of decisio nal incapacity is to diminish errors of m istakenly preventing com petent persons fro m directing the cou rse of their ow n treatment or of failing to protect the incapacitated from the harmfu l effect s of their decisions . Health care profession als will p robably play a su bstantial ro le, if no t the entire one, in the initial assessm ent and the find ing may nev er be reviewed by outside authorities. Nonetheless, sin ce assessm ent of an ind ividual's cap acity is largely a matter of comm on sense, there i s no i nherent reaso n why a health ca re professional m ust play this role. \"Decisionm aking i ncapacity\" is not a m edical or a ps ychiatric diagnostic cate gory; it rests o n a judgment of the typ e that an inform ed layperson might make\u2014that a patient lack s the ability t o understand a situation an d to make a choi ce in light of that understanding. Indeed, if a dispute ari ses or a l egal determination of a patient's com petence is required, the judge em powered to make the d etermination will con sider the situ ation not as a m edical expert but as a layp erson . On th e basis of the testimony of heal th care personnel and ot hers w ho k now the individual well, and possibly from pers onal observation of the patient, the judge must deci de whether the patient is capable of m aking inform ed decisions that adequately prot ect his or her own interests. Health ca re professi onals are calle d upon to m ake these as sessm ents because the question of inca pacity to make health ca re decisions usually arises wh ile a p erson is u nder their care. Particu larly within institutions such as hospit als, a treating physi cian oft en involves colleague s from psychiatry, psychology, a nd neurol ogy who have ways to accum ulate, organize, and analyze information relevant to such assessments.8 These Alan M eisel, The \"Exceptions \" to the Informed Consent Doctrine: Striking a Balance Between Competing Va lues in M edical Decisionmaking , 1979 WIS. L. REV. 413 , 436 , 476. 8 The \" mental status examination \" is perhaps the best example of how Determ ining Incap acity 173 exam inations can yield considera ble information ab out the pat ient's capabilities. Th e sou rces of useful information to be collected include discussions of th e situ ation wit h relativ es an d other care-g ivers, particularly those i n close contact with the pat ient, such as n urses. Ultimately, wh ether a patient's cap abilities are su fficiently li mited and the ina dequaci es sufficiently extensi ve for the person to be c onsidered incapacitated is a matter fo r carefu l judgment in ligh t of th e demands of the situ ation. If th e patient improves (or worsens) or if the d ecisio n to be made has different consequences, a reass essment of t he individual's capaci ty may be re quired. Finally, in any assessm ent of capacity d ue care sho uld be paid to the reaso ns for a part icular patient's impaired cap acity, not because the reason s play an y role in determining whether th e patient's judgment is to be honored but because identification of t he causes of incapacity may assist in their rem edy or re moval.9 The C ommission u rges t hat those responsible for assessi ng capaci ty not be cont ent with pro viding a n answ er to the quest ion of whet her or not a pa rticular pat ient is incapacitated .

About the only generalization that can be mad e is f ound in the treatises sug gesting th at th e proper practice when the patient canno t give consent is for a close family member to do so if one is available.

Determ ining determin ations of incapacity are b est made with out rou tine recou rse to the cou rts.

As a result, gu ardians are often , though not always, fi nancial institutions or institutional emp loyees such as b ankers, who are eith er ill- suited to or uninterested in the task of m anaging an individual's pe rsonal affairs . to a djudicate incom petency\u2014 that is, to confirm th e patient's lack of decisional cap acity\u2014is o ften so burdensome to both prov iders an d patients or to their fam ilies th at there is a trem endous relucta nce to unde rtake it. E ven whe n an a djudication of incom petency is sought, the pro ceedings are in many cases so perfunctory and/or deferential to the professional expertise of providers that the role of the courts amounts to little more than pro form a ratification of what wa s readi ly appare nt to health professi onals. Thu s the Commission recommends that, except wh ere state law clearly requires judicial in tervention, determinations of decisional incapacity b e made at the institutional level and that law makers b e encourag ed to recogn ize th e validity of such determinations. This recogn ition will requ ire institutions to adopt procedures that merit such deference; in turn, it should reinforce for all p articipants in the process th e im portance of reaching a so und decision.

They are refl ected, ro ughly speaking, in the two differen t stan dards that have traditionally guided decision making for the incapacitated : \"sub stituted judgment\" an d \"best in terests.\" Altho ugh these standards are now used in health care situ ations, they h ave their origins in a different cont ext\u2014namely, the resol ution of family disputes and decisions about the co ntrol of the prop erty of legal incompetents. Whe n people becom e seri ously disabled and unable to manage t heir property, they may b e judged in competent a nd a guardia n appointe d to make fi nancial and property deci sions. These doctrines were de veloped to instruct guardians abou t the boundaries of thei r powers wit hout issuing detailed and specific gu idelines and to prov ide a stan dard for guidance of courts that must review decisions proposed by a guardian.1 Simply stated , und er th e substitu ted judgment standard, th e decision s made for an incapacitated person should attem pt to arriv e at the sam e choi ce the person would make if 1 See gen erally Lawrence A. Frolik, Plenar y Guardianship: An Analysis, a Critique, and a Proposal for Reform, 23 ARIZ. L. REV . 599 (198 1). 178 Making Heal th Care Deci sions: Chapter 9 competent to do so (but within boundaries of \"reason ableness\" in tended to protect the incom petent).2 Unde r the best interests standard, decisions are acceptable if they woul d prom ote the welfare of the hypot hetical \"avera ge person\" in the position of the incompetent, which may not be the sam e choice th e individual wou ld make (but which m ay still h ave some aspects of su bjectiv ity to it).3 Despi te the long legal history of both these standa rds, they provide only hazy guidance for decisionm aking even in t heir original c ontexts, not to mention in the oft en far m ore com plex, urge nt, and pe rsonal settin g of h ealth care. number of rece nt cases involvi ng decisions about heal th care f or incapacitated pat ients have given c ourts the op portun ity to clarify th ese often vague guidelines, increased confusion may have acc ompanied some of the attempts to add preci sion to these do ctrines. Subs tituted Judgme nt. The substitu ted judgment stan dard requires that th e surrog ate atte mpt to replicate faith fully th e decisio n that th e incapaci tated person would make if he or she were able to make a ch oice. In so doing, the patient's interest in achieving well-b eing as h e or sh e defines it in a ccorda nce wit h personal val ues and goals, as well as the individual's interest in self-determination, a re both honored to the maximum extent possible, given the fundamen tal reality th at the patient literally can not make a c ontemporaneous cho ice. Th e surro gate's decision is limited, however, by two general external constraints. First, the su rrogate is circu mscrib ed by the same li mitations that so ciety legitimately imposes o n patients who are ca pable of deci ding for themselves,4 such as not com promising public health (e.g., by refu sing a mandatory v accination) or not tak ing step s contrary to th e crim inal law (e.g., intentional maiming). Secon d, there are certain decisio ns that a patient might be permitted to make but that are outside the d iscreti on of substitu te decisionmaking and must therefore b e decided by th e stand ards of \"reas onable ness.\" This is 2 For exam ple, the substituted ju dgment doc trine perm its a surrogate to m ake a gift of s ome of an incom petent's assets to a r elative to whom the incom petent person had previously made gifts . The court will approve such a gift to the ex tent that it does not endanger funds needed for the in competent's support\u2014even if the incom petent person would hav e been wi lling to be more generous . 3 The b est interests doctrin e has received m ost attention in law in cases invo lving questions of the custod y and car e of children , see generally 2 C.J.S. Adoption of Persons \u00a7\u00a7 90-9 1 (1972), and in cases involving the exp enditur e of trust funds, see gener ally 76 AM. JUR. 2d, Trusts \u00a7 288 (197 5), neith er of which are entirely accur ate guides to understanding how the st andard ought to operate in instanc es of surrogate health care decisionmaki ng for adults who lack decisionmakin g capacity. 4 See Chapter Two supra. Deci sionmaking for the Incapacitated 179 especially true for cas es in which the deci sion ri sks imposing substantial harm on patients or depriving them of substantial b enefit; p eople may volunteer for risky researc h with no direct therapeutic bene fits to themselves but guardians m ay not enroll people in such research m erely because it is known that, when they were c ompetent, they believed that such research was very important. Thu s even th e essen tially su bjective substitu ted judgment stan dard is con strained by external limitations\u2014 that is, limitati ons not arising from the patient's own views. For the substitu ted judgment stan dard to be employed there must be evidence of the patient's vi ews, which could be deri ved from various sources . The surrogate m ay be guid ed in deci sionmaking by prior directives expressly made by that patient governing the precise matter at issue. A pe rson might, for instance, have clearly stated that he or s he wished to avoid a potentially bene ficial treatm ent that poses a risk of cripp led mental facu lties if th ere were anoth er treatm ent availab le that, although promisin g more li mited benefits, also poses su bstantially smaller risks of damaging the mind. The sub stituted judgment standard is markedly simpler to use\u2014and contains great er ass urance of being faithfu lly i mplemented\u2014when a competent individual has gi ven clear directives re garding m edical care in the event of incapacity, altho ugh such a dir ective doe s not nece ssarily resolve all p roblems.5 When directiv es are written rather than oral, it is more likely th at th e surrogate ( or a third party wh o may report the incapacitated patien t's putative d irectio ns to the surrogate) will n ot forget or misunderst and the patient's advance directives. In the absence of advance directives, surrogates m ay be guided by the known values, goals, and desires of an incapacitated pat ient. It can reaso nably be presum ed, for example, that a pe rson who is known to have had a pa rticular ave rsion to painful medical intervent ions would wish to continue avoiding them if possible. Best Interes ts. Decision making guided b y the best in terests standa rd requi res a surrogate to do what , from an objective standpoint, appea rs to promote a pat ient's good without reference t o the patient's actual or supposed preferences. Th is does not m ean the surrogate m ust choose the m eans t he pract itioner t hinks is \"best \" for promoting the patient's well-being, but only a means reason ably likely to achi eve that goal. Where , for e xample, there is more than one the rapy available, a decision in favor of anyone of those considered appropriate by heal th care professionals will be acceptable unde r the best 5 See pp. 155-66 supra. 180 Making Heal th Care Deci sions: Chapter 9 interests standard. Howe ver, the be st interests standa rd would precl ude the s urrogate from choo sing a thera py that is totally unacceptable by professional standa rds, eve n if the sur rogate might choose that treatm ent for him- or Fundam entally, d caut ious. In assessi ng whether a pr ocedure or course of treatment woul d be i n a patient's best interests, the su rrogate must take int o account s uch factors as the relief of suffering, the preservat ion or rest oration of functioning, and the quality as well as t he extent of life su stain ed.6 An accurate a ssessment will enc ompass co nsideration of t he satisfaction of presen t desires, th e op portunities for futu re satisfactio ns, and the possibility of developing or regaining the capacity fo r self-determin ation. The im pact of a decision on an incapacitated patient's loved on es may b e taken into accoun t in determining someone's best interests, fo r most people do have an imp ortant interest in the well- being of their families or c lose ass ociates. T o avoid abuse, howe ver, es pecially stringe nt standards of evi dence should be required to support a cla im that reaso nable people wo uld d isrega rd their exclusively self-re garding interests (f or example, in prolonging or avoiding suffering) in favor of their interest in avoiding psychological or financial burdens on the people to whom they were attach ed. The Stand ard for Surr ogate Decisionmaking. The Commis incapac itated pat ients ought, when possible, to be guided by the principle of su bstituted judgmen t, sin ce it promotes the un derlying values of sel f-determination an d wel l-being better th an the best interests stan dard does. Ho wever, the p rinciple of substitu ted jud gment can not b e employed universally; wh at so me patients woul d want if com petent can not always be asce rtained because of insufficient evide nce about a pa tient's values a nd prefe rences or because the patient's cognitive abilities have always been so limited tha t he or she was never capa ble of devel oping or expressing preferences about t he decision in question.7When a patient's likely decision is not known, the best interests standard presumes that the individual would 6 The phras e \"qualit y of lif e\" has been us ed in differing way s; sometimes it refers to the va lue that the cont inuation of life h as for th e pati ent, and ot her tim es to th e value th at others find in the continuation of the p atient's life , perhaps in term s of their estimates of the patien t's actual or potential productivity or social contribution. In apply ing th e bes t inter est princip le, the Commissi on is concerned with th e value of the patient's life for th e patient. 7 Allen E . Buch anan, The Limits of Pr oxy Decis ion Making for Incompeten ts, 29 UCLA L. REV. 393 (1981); John A. Robertson, Legal Criteria for Orders Not to Resuscitate: A Response to Justice Liacos, in A. Edward Doudera and J. Douglas Peters, eds., LEGAL AND ETHICAL Deci sionmaking for the Incapacitated 181 prefer what m ost reasona ble people would want in similar circum stances. On ce rtain points, of course, no consensus may exist about what \"most reaso nable people\" w ould pre fer. Furtherm ver a range of choices ex ists, ev en a best interests d etermination will d isplay an element of subject ivity on t he part of the surrogate in defining and wei ghing the patient's interests. To the extent feasib le, effo rts shou ld be made wi th patients who are incapacitated though able to en gage in communicatio n to take into account thei r expressi ons of their own values and goals .8 Doing so will both promote their welfare as they understand a nd conceive o f it and honor self-determination, though of an attenuated kind. Whe n reco very of the cap acity to make decisio ns is a reason able possibility, en hancing its prospect should be another goal. Procedures for Surrogate Decisionm aking Regardless of the substantive principle use d to guide decisionmaking for patients l acking decisi onal cap acity, p olicies and procedures are neede d for the sel ection and guidance of surrogate decisionm akers. Furtherm ore, t here is a need to sp ecify the circum stances unde r whic h review o f the surrogate's d ecisio n shou ld be permitted or requ ired and who should undertake suc h a revi ew. T he Commission recom mends t hat howe ver thes e problem s are actually to be resol ved, health ca re institutions should have clear p olicies abo ut who has the authority a nd respon sibility to determine incapacity, to speak forthe patient, and to review determinations and decisions. The Select ion of a Surrogat e. A soun d policy f or decisio nmaking for incapacitat ed patients shoul d take into account the urge ncy of the need to make a decision and the existen ce of su itable substitu tes su ch as interested family members o r a leg al guardian. ASPECTS O F TREATING CRITICALLY AND TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS, AUPHA Press, Washi ngton, D.C. (1 982) at 159-63. 8 The only necessar y implicat ion of a determination of incapacity to decid e abou t health car e is that the pa tient's decis ion, if a ny, m ay be ov . Even are suffici ently im paired th at it would b e inappropri ate to take their pref erences as bind ing, pa tients may still b e able to apprec iate many aspects of the decis ion and may feel th ey have been treate d more respectfully if those vested with the power to make decisions about them recognize the exten t to which they are sen tient beings with valu es an d preferen ces of their own. Encouraging p articipation in the decis ionmaking proces s may in fact fa cilitate recover y of cap acity und er some circum stances. These pat ients would be well served if the ir surrogates were to let them make such decisions f or themselves , although the surr ogate's p ermission may also be required . 182 Making Health Care Decisions: Chapter 9 Emerg encies. Whe n a deci sion m ust be m ade immediately, in order to avoid seriously j eopardizing a patient's life or well- being, health care profe ssionals are the proper decisionm akers.9 Since such e mergency care is so often in institutio gs involving many practitio ners, one as pect of a so und policy is havi ng t he m eans to assi gn decisionmaking authority to a particular m ember of the treatment team. This person should usu ally be the av ailable p rofession al who is m ost qualified to make the decision, acco rding to the provider's estim ate o f the patient's best interests. The line between em ergenc y and nonemergency deci sions will sometimes b e hard to draw and will depend in part upon the typ e of facility an d the read y av ailability o f additional personnel for qu ick consultatio n. In stitutional policy sh ould minimize an y ten dency to overextend the exce ptionally broad decisionmaking a uthority that genuine em ergencies con fer on practition ers. As soon as possible, without compromising the patient's well- being, other surrogates (such as family members) sh ould be located , informed about the choices to be made, an d involved in the decisionmaking.10 Nonemerg ency situa tions. In nonemergency situations, the proper presumption is th at th e family, defined to include clo sest relativ es an d intimate frien ds,11 shou ld make health care decision s for an incapacitate d patient. T here are se veral grounds for this stance: (1) The family is general ly most conce rned about the good of the patient. 9 Allen Bu chan an, Medical Paternalism or Legal Imperialism: Not the Onl y Alternat ives for Handling Sa ikewicz-type Cas es, 5 LAW & M ED. 97 , 105-06 (1979); Alan Meisel, The \"Exceptions \" to Cons ent Doctr ine: Striking a Balan Com peting Values l . 10 Meisel, supra note 9 , at 476. 11 The Com mission's broad use of the term \"family\" reflects a recognition of th e fact th at man y of those with most know ledge and concern for the patient may not be his or her actual rel atives. Th e fact th at more than one person m ay fall with in this cat egory points to the ne ed to designate one person as the princip al decisionm aker f or the incap acitated pati ent. One possibilit y is to define a presumptive priority , e.g., that a person living with his or her spouse will spea k for that spouse, t hat adul t child ren will sp eak for elder ly widowed parents, etc. I n some cases such presumptions may be helpful. Ne vertheless, the Commi ssion believes that it is the re sponsibility of the practitioner to determine who acts as the pat ient's \" surrogate .\" No n eat form ulas or serial ord erings will suffice to captur e the complexities involv ed in determining who among the indiv iduals presenting th emselves as friend s and re latives of the patient k nows the patien t best and has his or her best interests in view. The responsibility is therefore on the prac titioner either to det ermine who th is spo kesperson is or to go to court to have a guardian appointed. Deci sionmaking for the Incapacitated 183 (2) Th e family will also usually b e most knowledgeable about the patient's goals, preferences, and values. (3) The fam ily deserves recog nition as an important social u nit that o ught to be treated , with in limits, as a sin gle decision maker in matters th at intimately affect its members. Especially in a so ciety in which many other trad itional form s of community h ave been eroded , particip ation in a fam ily is o ften an important dimension of pers onal fulfillment. Since a prot ected sphe re of privacy and auto nomy is req uired for th e flourishing of th is interpersonal union, institutions and the state sh ould b e reluctan t to intrude, particu larly reg arding matters th at are pers onal and on which there is a wide range of opinion in society. The presu mption that the family is the princi pal decisionm aker m ay be challenge d for any of a num ber of rea sons: decisional incapacity o f family members, unresolvable disagreement among c ompetent adul t members of t he fam ily about the correct decision, evi dence of p hysical or psychological abuse or neglect of the patient by the family, evidence of bias ag ainst the patient's in terest due to con flicting in terests, or evidence th at the fam ily intends to disregard the patient's ad vance directiv e or the p atient's und istorted, stabl e values and pre ferences.12 Even if, for one or m ore of these reas ons, the fam ily is disqual ified from prin cipal decisio nmaker, it will o ften be appropriate to include family members in the decisionmaking process. 12 Buch anan , supra note 9 , at 11 1. 184 Making Heal th Care Deci sions: Chapter 9 Nonemergency situations i n which an incapacitated pat ient has no family but does have a co urt-appointed guardian raise spec ial issues t hat are so metimes overlooked. The con siderations that supp ort a str ong presumption in favo r of th e fam ily's b eing the principal decision maker are wea ker in the case of a court-appointed guardian, unless the guardian had been nominated by the patient prior to his or he r incapacitation (i n which case the guardian would be included in the definition of fam ily used here).13 In the absence of disqualifying reas ons, a guardian s hould act as health ca re decisi onmaker si nce t he person was already making the patient's other, nonheal th-related deci sions. Through involvement in past decision making, the gu ardian may have acquired a know ledge of the patien t's beliefs, con cerns, and values. Fi nally, in addition to the ethical grounds there are l egal one s: the guar dian has t he sanction o f court authority, wh ich should red uce th e co ncern s of practitio ners th at following this particular su rrogate's decision s will ex pose th em to civil liability. If no family or legal guardian is in itially av ailab le, a su itable surrogate decisionmaker sh ould be de signated to ensure a clear assig nment of authority fo r decisio nmaking and of responsib ility fo r the exercise of th is authority. Un less a suitable surrogate de cisionm aker is identified, treat ment decisions m ay lack con tinuity or may rest on an unclear foundation, m aking it difficult if not impossi ble to ensure that the process by which decisions are made is ethically and l egally sound. Review Pr ocedures. Many people have \"natural guardians\" whose authority is eith er recogn ized as a m atter o f law (fo r example, parents deciding for children) or as a matter of c ustom (for e xample, one spouse deciding for the other).14 The deci sions m ade by such s urrogates are not routinely sub jected to formal review. Su ch review is m ore lik ely to occur when very significant medical interventions are being contemplated, when disagreement arises bet ween heal th professionals and su rrogate decisionmakers, or when decisions are made by a guardian appointed by the court. Form al revi ew appea rs to be occurri ng wit h greater frequency; a t the least, it is being more wi dely rep orted in the press. R eview m ay be more frequent because of pra ctitioners ' growing sensitivit y to the need to protect th e interests of patients or because of their i ncreased fear of le gal liability, fro m which an advance ruling by a cou rt cou ld insulate th em.15 13 If an in capacitated patient has both a com petent fam ily and a legal guard ian, they should function together as princip al decisio nmakers to the extent p ermitted by local law. 14 See note 10 , Chapter Eigh t supra. 15 See g enerally Robert A. Burt, TAKING CARE OF STRANGERS, The Free Press, New York (1979). Deci sionmaking for the Incapacitated 185 Although st ate law may requi re judicial revi ew of certai n decisions by a surro gate, well-co nceived and carefu lly ex ecuted in stitutional guidelines m ay eliminate re course t o the courts th at is unnecessary for adeq uate protection of pat ients' interests. Certainly, formal court procee dings on each a nd e very hea lth c are determ ination would be unduly intrusive, slow, and cost ly and would frame treatm ent deci sions in mislead ingly adversarial term s.16 Judicial review. The m ost important kind of f ormal revi ew at the moment is judicial. Th e justificatio ns for turnin g to the cou rts are: (1) th e state has a proper role, as parens pat riae, in protecting the hel pless, such as patients lacking health ca re deci sionmaking capacity; (2 ) the authority of the state is leg itimately exercised by courts in life-and -death matters, as in other important situations requiring individual decision; and (3) courts ca n reach appropriate judgm ents because of their expe rtise and disinterest ed stance i n the resolution of disputes,17 Greater relianc e on a dvance judicial review has raised a num ber of conce rns about the relative costs and benefits of relying on courts to pass on the deci sions of surrogates for incapacitated patients. Judicial review in such cases i s costly in term s of time and expense; it can disrupt the process of providing care for a pat ient, since medical deci sionmaking is evolutionary rath er th an static; i t can create unnecessa ry strains in the relationship between t he surrogate deci sionmaker an d others, suc h as the health care providers, who may be fo rced into the role of formal adversaries in th e litig ation; and it expo ses d elicate matters th at are usually rega rded as private 16 Nevertheless, arrangement s should be made to ensure that the appropriate cases do com e before a form al tribun al, as when, for exam ple, th e pat ient expresses a desi re for jud icial review, or the p atient's he alth needs will requir e continu al decisionmaking on a broad rang e of issues. Further, it is in cumbent upon health car e providers to seek rev iew when they believe that a surrog ate's decision abou t treatment f ails to reflect the patient's valu es and goals (to the exten t that they are ascer tainable) or th e patient's best interests. 17 The argum ent for jud icial review is well stated b y Professor Baron. See Charles H. Baron, Assuring \"Detached Bu t Passionate In vestigation and Decis ion\": The Role o f Guardians Ad L item in Saik ewicz-Type Case s, 4 AM. J. LAW & MED. 111 (1978); Charles H.

Freq uently, however, it appea rs that the process of judicial review is merely a form ality. Judges m ay not fee l that they are able to a dd very much to the decisions alrea dy reache d by those m ost intim ately involve d, pa rticularly in cases that are brough t simply to obtain judicial san ction for an agree d course of conduct,19Rath er th an being an issu e th e co urts are accustom ed to addressi ng, s uch as whether the surrogates are appropriate decisionm akers or s hould be disq ualified because they are incom petent or have a co nflict of interest, the que stion typically address ed is whet her the treatm ent chos en is the right one.20 Since this jud gment 18 Buchanan , supra note 9 , at 10 5-06. 19 See, e.g., In re Nemser, 51 Misc.2d 616, 273 N.

Institutio nal review . To prov ide an altern ative th at is m ore respon sive to the needs of all p arties, \"institu tional ethics committees\"21 are inc reasingl y being used.22 Because the y are close r to the treatm ent setting, becaus e their delibe rations ar e informal and typi cally private (a nd are u sually regard ed by the particip ants as fallin g with in the g eneral ru les of medical co nfidentiality), a nd because they can reconv ene easily o r can delegate deci sions t o a sep arate subgroup of me mbers, ethics committees may have som e marked ad vantages over judicial review when it com es to decision making that is rapid and sen sitive to th e issu es at hand. Furtherm ore, t estimony prese nted to the Commission indicated that these committees have had a valuable educational role for professionals.23 Very little is k nown, however, ab out the actual effectiven ess of institutional eth ics co mmitte es, esp ecially in compariso n with private, informal mechani sms or wi th judicial deci sionmaking for pat ients who lack decisionmaking cap acity. The com position and functions of existing ethics co mmitt ees v ary su bstantially fro m one institution to another. Not enough e xperience ha s accum ulated to da te to know the appropriate and most effect ive functions and hence the suitable composition of such committees. If th eir role is to serv e primarily as \"pro gnosis comm ittees\" to pass on the accuracy of an a ttending physician's judgm ent, the n committees com posed largel y of ph ysicians would seem appropriate.24 If the ethics committees are suppos ed to reach decisions that best reflect the individually defined wel l-being of patients or t he ethicality of deci sions, however, it seem s dou btful that an e xclusively medical group would be suitable. And if th e app ropriate ro le of such review would, we think , in s imilar circ umstances exerc ise such a choic e in the same way for themselves or for those clos est to them. 21 The Com mission uses the term \"institutiona l ethi cs com mittee\" rath er than \"hospital ethics com mittee\" be cause such com mittees could well funct ion in other h ealth care institu tions such as nursing hom es. 22 In th e pas t decade, 5% of large hos pitals (that is, thos e with more than 200 beds) have established such committees.

Alth ough committees ca n be reason ably prompt, efficien t, sensitiv e, and private, having m any of t he decisions about health care for th e incapacitate d made in an informal manner between surrogate and provi der is plainly a desira ble obje ctive as well, just as routi ne decisions for c ompetent patien ts shou ld be made by patient and provider without an y outside intervention. Furthermore, just as jud icial rev iew m ay sometimes b e an unnecessa rily onerous means o f reviewing medical deci sions, review by an ethics com mittee may also sometimes b e inappropriate. The Commission bel ieves there should be vari ous ki nds of revi ew mechanism s available. T hus, the Commis sion recommen ds that health care in stitutions not only develop app ropriate m echanisms but also encourage a nd coope rate in co mparative evaluations of s uch approaches .25 The resu lts of th ese stud ies wi ll have particular importance for so ciety b ecause one presumed advantage of institutional mechanisms is that they avoid the undesirable aspects of having to turn to more formal means of revie w. Ass urance that a ny new m echanism s have been well th ought out and are ap propriate to the task is need ed before widespread official sanct ions can be expected. 25 To assist in this endeavor , the Co mmission's forthcoming report on decision s about l ife-sustai ning treatm ent will provi de a more detailed exam ination o f the potenti als, liabilities, and re ported exp erience with inst itutiona l eth ics committees and other mechan isms for ensuring that decision making of hig h quality occurs.
