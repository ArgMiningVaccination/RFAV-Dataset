Local acupuncturist / global retreat leader [Jordanna Eve Dworkin, L.Ac.](http://www.intouchsf.com/) and world-renowned sound alchemist/wellness producer, Shane Thunder (@spiritmetacine), combine gentle acupuncture, breathing practices, and live sound to elevate mental and emotional clarity, calm the nervous system, and liberate energetic blockages for deep healing. A lovingly curated collection and activation of acupuncture points calm the mind and ground the body, inducing deep states of relaxation and expansive consciousness. Weaving breath to center and soothe, we will then journey through an exquisite soundscape of gemstone-infused crystal bowls, 6 planetary / elemental gongs, chimes, and so much more. Experience a palpable shift of brain wave frequencies from the waking state (beta) to the deep meditative state (theta + delta). Lay back with ease, and lean into our beautiful Love Story Yoga community. We are delighted to share all the feels IN-PERSON! Please bring layers, a thick yoga mat, pillows, and other cozy comforts for our journey. Bio: About Shane Thunder: Shane is a California-based Master Sound Alchemist residing in Santa Barbara, CA.
