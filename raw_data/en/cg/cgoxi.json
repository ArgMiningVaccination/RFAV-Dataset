She graduated with honors in 1997, receiving a B.S. in biology and minors in chemistry and psychology. This educational foundation allowed Meggan to work for a biotechnology company in San Francisco as well as for the California Department of Health, conducting molecular biology research for HIV vaccines and viral disease models in the human body. While she found this research work challenging, stimulating and fascinating, she missed a core element of human interaction. This realization, paired with the immense health benefits Meggan had personally received from Chinese medicine, led her to pursue a four-year master's program in Chinese Medicine at the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM) in Portland, OR. This intensive program brought together her interests in biomedicine (Western medicine), Chinese/Asian medicine, Chinese herb / natural medicinal uses, scientific research, nutrition, qigong and meditation, linking human health to the surrounding environment / elements, clinical human interactions and, of course, overall wellness and health support. During this time, Meggan worked for the prestigious OCOM research department coordinating studies funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and she co-authored two professional research articles on Chinese Medicine. Meggan has practiced Chinese medicine since 2006. She has worked with people from a diverse background of cultures, ages and employment backgrounds by supporting better health, less pain, nutritional support, emotional freedom and teaching clients to better care for their own wellness. Meggan worked as a Chinese medicine practitioner at the Nez Perce / Nimippuu health clinic in Lapwai, ID from 2007 to 2009. She co-founded and operated Healing Point, LLC Chinese Medicine Clinic in Moscow, ID from its inception in 2007 until June, 2013 - when she became the sole owner. During that time, she had the pleasure to work with hundreds of clients from the Palouse region. Meggan's professional assets include interfacing biomedicine with East Asian medicine, applying research results to health care / clinical care and the ability to incorporate the related health and cultural aspects from the 21 different countries she has visited. Her integrity, calming presence, intelligence and sense of humor bestow comfort to her clients and she is a catalyst for heart-felt enjoyment of life. She believes each person has inherit worth, health and wellness already programmed within. Chinese medicine is one way to remind the body of and reestablish these healing patterns. Meggan is honored that so many clients have entrusted her to support their health care journey. Meggan enjoys yoga, qigong, meditation, hiking, skiing, biking, water skiing, wood working on a lathe, gardening, making herbal teas from her private garden, coloring, traveling, reading, cooking and eating good food and spending time with dear friends and family.
