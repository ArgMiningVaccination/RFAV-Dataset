When we build an investment case, we need to look at the stock with a holistic perspective. In the case of GAZP, it is a company that has been able to sustain great financial health, trading at an attractive share price. Below is a brief commentary on these key aspects. If you're interested in understanding beyond my high-level commentary, take a look at the [report on Gazprom here](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ru/energy/mcx-gazp/gazprom-shares?l=0&t=terra_fabjsynxrf_lnubb&s=1&id=491080&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=finance_user<=Conc_ticker&utm_campaign=Conc_ticker). Undervalued with adequate balance sheet GAZP's strong financial health means that all of its upcoming liability payments are able to be met by its current cash and short-term investment holdings. This suggests prudent control over cash and cost by management, which is an important determinant of the company's health. GAZP appears to have made good use of debt, producing operating cash levels of 0.46x total debt in the prior year. This is a strong indication that debt is reasonably met with cash generated. GAZP is currently trading below its true value, which means the market is undervaluing the company's expected cash flow going forward. Investors have the opportunity to buy into the stock to reap capital gains, if GAZP's projected earnings trajectory does follow analyst consensus growth, which determines my intrinsic value of the company. Compared to the rest of the oil and gas industry, GAZP is also trading below its peers, relative to earnings generated. This further reaffirms that GAZP is potentially undervalued.
