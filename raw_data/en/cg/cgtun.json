Our vision is to grow our activities beyond the initial offerings of integrative anthroposophic Family Medicine with two physicians, osteopathy, and educational events. Since this spring Therapeutic Eurythmy is also offered at Carah now with a waiting list. We hope that additional activities may follow, depending on the needs in our community and who feels called to join us in their work. The physicians now also have a growing waiting list and we are looking to add another Family Physician as we grow. What does the word Carah mean? Definitions will continue to be inspired by these Gaelic, Welsh and Indonesian meanings as we unfold our future vision of patients, doctors, nurses, therapists and supporters working together in a healing space. We envision building a new clinic inspired by life-enhancing architecture in Chester County, PA to provide a home for patients' individual healing journeys. We are currently looking for an appropriate property which will allow for the realization of this vision. As we embark on this project we are looking to connect with cultural creatives who feel called to collaborate in further manifesting this unique mission founded on freedom in the medical-therapeutic realm, equality in our relationships and solidarity in economics.

As a Camphill community, the insights of Rudolf Steiner regarding individual development, social organization, and world evolution inform our striving. There are just over 100 residents of the community and a rich network of families, employees, day volunteers and friends that we interact with daily. We are interested in long term co-workers for life sharing or for local therapists who could work with our community part time. We envision for either option that therapy artists could have the option to work part time with patients in the surrounding community through the Carah Medical Arts clinic if desired. We currently have anthroposophic nurses, oil dispersion bath therapy and a retired therapeutic eurythmist in our community. Although we would be open to conversations with all anthroposophic therapists, we are particularly looking for art therapy, music therapy, speech therapy, rhythmic massage and therapeutic eurythmy.
