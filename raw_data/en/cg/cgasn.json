If I do not have a PCP, where can I go to get required immunizations and titers? - You can get your immunizations from a local pharmacy (Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, etc.) or a local urgent care center. You can get your titer/s at Any Lab Test Now (anylabtestnow.com) or a local urgent care center. I can't find my childhood immunization records; what do I do? - You can get an MMR titer, Hep B titer, and Varicella titer to test for immunity. If any of your titers come back negative/non-immune, you will need to complete the full vaccine series. You will still need a current Tdap and TB test. What if I would like to be exempted from one or more of the vaccination requirements? - The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center affiliate institutions do require students training at their locations to comply with all applicable site policies, including vaccinations. Those policies vary by location and some site policies do not contain exemptions. Hepatitis B I've don't have a Hep B titer in my childhood immunization records, is it too late for me to get one now since I had the Hep B vaccines as a child? - No, you can get your Hep B titer now. Where can I get a Hep B titer? - You can contact your PCP, Any Lab Test Now (anylabtestnow.com), or a local urgent care center. What should I do if I have a negative/non-reactive Hep B titer? - If you have documentation of 3 previous Hep B vaccines, you will need to get 1 additional Hep B vaccine, then repeat your titer 4 weeks later. If you do not have documentation of 3 Hep B vaccines, you will need to complete the 3-dose series. What if my repeat Hep B titer is still negative/non-reactive after 1 additional Hep B vaccine? - You will need to complete the 3-dose series, receiving the 2nd vaccine at that time (4 weeks after the initial dose). The 3rd vaccine will be due 6 months from the 1st vaccine. Once you have completed the series, you will need to have a final Hep B titer 4 weeks later. As long as you're receiving the vaccines as scheduled, this will not prevent you from starting classes. What if classes start before my repeat titer is due? Will this prevent me from starting? - No, you can still attend classes/orientation. When your titer is due, contact Student Health and we will put in the lab order. Flu Vaccine Is a flu vaccine required? - A flu vaccine is only required if you start classes between October 1st and March 31st. MMR What if I have never had the MMR vaccines or I am unsure of my MMR vaccination status and MMR titers do not show immunity? - You will need to receive 2 MMR vaccines, given 28 days apart. You will need the 1st vaccine before you're cleared to start. If your 2nd vaccine is not due until after classes start, you will be able to get it at Student Health. What if I received 2 doses of MMR, but my titer is still negative/non-immune? - You should receive 1 MMR booster, then repeat your titer 4 weeks later. What if classes start before my repeat titer is due? Will this prevent me from starting? - No, you can still attend classes/orientation. When your titer is due, contact Student Health and we will put in the lab order. Varicella I had chickenpox as a child; what should I do? - You will need to have a varicella titer to prove immunity. History of disease is not accepted as proof of immunity. What if I had chickenpox as a child, but have a negative/non-immune titer? - You will need to receive 2 doses of Varicella vaccine, given 28 days apart. What if I cannot find documentation of Varicella vaccine and I'm not sure if I've had chickenpox? - You will need to receive 2 doses of Varicella vaccine, given 28 days apart. You will need the 1st vaccine before you're cleared to start. If your 2nd vaccine is not due until after classes start, you will be able to get it at Student Health. What if I received 2 doses of Varicella, but my titer is still negative/non-immune? - You should receive 1 Varicella booster, then repeat your titer 4 weeks later. TB Testing Can I get a TB skin test, or do you require a blood test? - You can get either, as long as it's done on or after January 1st of the year you start. Do I have to do 2 TB skin tests? - If you elect to do a TB skin test, you only need to submit 1 negative test done on or after January 1st of the year you start. I've had a past positive TB test; what do I do? - If your positive test was a TB skin test, it is recommended to have a Quantiferon Gold drawn to rule out a false-positive skin test. If you have had a positive IGRA (Quantiferon Gold or T-Spot), you will need to submit a chest x-ray completed on or after January 1st of the year you start. If you've completed latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) treatment, you will need to submit documentation, along with a current chest x-ray. What if my last chest x-ray is less than 5 years ago? - You will need to have a new chest x-ray done on or after January 1st of the year you start. This is a requirement when you're starting at a new institution. This chest x-ray will be valid the time you're a student at UTSW. However, certain off-campus clinic rotations may require a new one.
