INTRODUCTION The changing demographic in the UK and other developed countries towards an increasing proportion of older people and the associated spiralling costs of health and social care policy has increased interest in the prevention of ill-health and frailty in old age (1). Such prevention efforts could be directed at the promotion of resilience , which refers to being able to resist minor challenges (e.g. having a urinary infection without becoming confused or falling) and also being able to recover rapidly even if initially destabilised as a result of challenge (e.g. returning to fu ll function after having a fall). Many factors contribute to resilience, and hence s ervices and interventions to prevent infirmity include traditional public health behavioural interventions (such as reducing alcohol and tobacco consumption, improving diet and increasing physical activity ), but also those dealing with loneliness, social isolation, poor housing , health literacy and self- management skills (2). There are c hallenges to those planning and delivering health and social care services to promote resilience. Given the multifactorial nature of resilience , it is likely that a wide range of such services will need to be in place before they are sufficient to promote it. This gives rise to the integration challenge of matching these services to those who might benefit from them , and in a person -centred way (3, 4). Furthermore, h ealth and social care planners have relatively little population -level information to guide them in what they should provide. One approach to dealing with these challenges is to use a tool for multidimensional needs assessment. Such tools could enable a comprehensive assessment of an individual's resilience factors, and this assessment could facilitate the provision of services to address that individual's needs. If used across a population, the collated data from such standardised assessments could be used to produce a population needs assessment for the promotion of resilience. Standardised approaches to assessing needs ha ve been available since 1965 (5), and yet recent programmes of scre ening older people in the UK do not specif y a standardised assessment protocol or tool (6). Despite the growth in interest in this field in recent years, the literature in this area has not been reviewed for over a decade when the U K Department of Health reviewed tools suitable for the Single A ssessment Process programme (7), and when there were similar initiatives in Australasia (8, 9). Thus it is ISSN: 2059-3341 Community Assessment Tools Review www.nottingham.ac.uk/emran p 4 This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution -NonCommercial -NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

In this paper, our aim was to identify all the tools that have been developed for comprehensive needs assessment in community dwelling older people. Anticipating the use of such tools by multiple agencies and personnel including the voluntary sector, we looked only for tools that did not require a clinical examination or specialist assessment by a single professional but relied on questioning the older person. We aimed to identify needs assessment tools which identified problems experienced by older people and might be used in care planning, and to exclude assessment tools designed to measure quality of li fe or to be used as outcome measures. METHOD Scoping review methodology was used (10, 11) because the aim was to examine the extent, range and nature of research activity in the field. A systematic search using four academic databases was conducted ; Medline, EMBASE, CINHAL and PsycInfo . The following search terms were developed in Medline and adapted for the other databases. The search was limited to papers from 2002 (a decision made following examination of three previous grey literat ure reviews identified in preparatory work (7-9). The search was carried out in June 2 014. Search terms : Line 1 : \"Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)\"/mt or Needs Assessment/sn or \"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)\"/mt or Geriatric Assessment/mt Line 2: ((\"primary care\" or or Services/ people\").ti,ab.

Two reviewers (NC, CC) screened the titles and abstracts of citations, according to the inclusion criteria: multi-domain needs assessment and structured questionnaire s; English language; participants older than 65 years and community -dwelling . Exclusion criteria were as follows : protocol for a clinical assessment or examination ; tools that scre ened for a specific diagnostic condition ; and outcome measure s or quality of life measure s Articles which described the characteristics of the tool were identified for data extraction (NC & CC). Data describing the administration of the tool were extracted (number of items, setting wh ere tool used, staff or self-complete , completion time). Information about the domains assessed within each tool was also extracted , using t he domains of Comprehensive Geriatric A ssessment ( CGA) as a framework (12) (social circumstances, functioning, physical medical conditions, environment, mental health). Two reviewers extracted data and categorised the tools' domain names under the CGA framework (NC & CC) , with discrepancies in categori sation debated with a third reviewer (JG) until consensus was reached. RESULTS Search and Selection Figure 1 shows the result of the initial electronic searches: seventeen tools were identified meeting the criteria for inclusion. These are listed in Table 1. Seventeen further searches were conducted, using the name of each tool identified in the above s tage, to identify papers including information about the characteristics of these tools. 422 articles in total were found and 137 of these were included . The quantity of articles identified as describing each tool varied substantially: for four tools we identified nineteen or more articles (MDS -HC, Older Americans Resources and Services Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire, CANE and EASY -Care; see Table 1 ) but the remainder were cited within fewer than five articles.

Administration characteristics of assessment tools The administ ration characteristics of the seventeen needs assessment tools are shown in Table 1 . The number of items varied from 17 (Geriatric Postal Screening Survey) to 238 (MDS -HC) and the time required to complete them ranged from 5 (Primary Assessment Form) to 90 minutes (MDS -HC). Eight tools (Comprehensive Frailty Assessment Instrument, GFE, GPSS, Health Enhancement Lifestyle Profile, INTERMED for the Elderly Self-Assessment, NISAT, Self -care Ability Scale for the Elderly and Standardized Assessment for Elderly Patients ) had published evidence in peer -reviewed journals to show they could be completed by the older person, or with assistance from a formal or informal carer. Assessor training was stated to be required for six tools (CANE, EASY - Care, Eve ryday Competence Scale, Everyday Competence Questionnaire, Lorensen's Self-care Capability Scale PAF). Three tools (MDS -HC, OARS -MFAQ and PSCS -O) required a health professional to complete the assessment by questioning the older person but are not a cl inical examination. Content of tools The content of each tool are shown in Table 2, using the domains of the comprehensive geriatric assessment process (CGA). A ll tools covered at least three of the domains of CGA. The tools that assessed all five domains were the CANE, EASY -Care, GFE, MDS -HC, and NISAT. Some tools also assessed needs that could not be categorised within CGA domains such as the CANE and STEP which also assessed aspect s of the respondent's caregiver and were categorised under 'Other'.

They varied in terms of the administration characteristics such as the time taken to complete and the professional role of the assessor reported to have administered the tool. The tools which took the least time to administer were the G eriatric Functional Evaluation ( GFE), Health Enhancement Lifestyle Profile (HELP) and P rimary Assessment Form (PAF) tools, all of which could be completed i n less than 30 minutes. The tools varied in the comprehensiveness of the assessment, but four covered all five domains of CGA ; C amberwell Assessment of Needs in the Elderly (CANE) , EASY-Care, Geriatric Functional Assessment ( GFE), Minimum Data Set for Home Care (MDS -HC) and Northern Ireland Single Assessment Tool ( NISAT ). The other tools covered either three of four of these domains. The use of a systematic search of electronic databases to identify tools and a second enquiry to sort out tools that met the research aim , means that the list of tools presented here may not be complete. T here may be tools that we re not identified , such as those published entirely in languages other than English and tools that have n ot been published or subject to evaluatio n. This review adds to previously published understanding by identif ying 14 assessment tools that were not included in previous reviews (7-9). These additional tools are Comprehensive Frailty Assessment Instrument ( CFAI), Everyday Competence Scale (ECS), Everyday Competence Questionnaire ( ECQ), Geriatric Functional Evaluation (GFE), Geriatric Postal Screening survey Health Enhancement Lifestyle Profile (HELP), INTERMED -E-SA, Lorenson's Self -care Capability Scale ( LSCS), Northern Ireland Single Assessment Tool ( NISAT ), Older Americans Resources and Services Multidimensional Functio Questionnaire (OARS -MFAQ ), Primary assessment Form ( PAF), Physical Self -Concept Scale for Older Adults (PSCS -O), Self- care Ability Scale for the Elderly (SASE ) and Standardized Assessment for Elderly Patients (STEP). Funders are providers of community services who wish to standardise the needs assessment process of older people living in the community might find this list of 17 tools useful, especially if they are wishing to integrate multiple services. The choice could depend upon whether the assessment is intended to be entirely self -completed by the older person ( INTERMED -E-SA, NISAT ) or by someone other than a health ISSN: 2059-3341 Community Assessment Tools Review www.nottingham.ac.uk/emran p 17 This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution -NonCommercial -NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

Detailed assessments might be more valuable when used in care planning for an individual, whereas shorter ones might be more useful for signpost ing people towards resources or may be more user -friendly and hence more easily implemented . The amount of information recorded by a tool will also affect the richness of the data available for system wide needs assessment (at a population level). There may need to be a compromise between different stakeholders ' perspectives. For example a commissioner may require systematic information however patients and keyworkers may find an extensive approach overly burdensome. Whilst there may be a need to develop more tools or to establish the psychometric priorities of the existing ones further, it is essential for further research to examine the best ways of using these tools in the most efficient systematic way . For example, can tools that have been developed to be admini stered by a professional maintain validity when self -completed or completed over the telephone , online or via an app ? Ultimately , future research should aim to establish an improvement in patient outcomes in complex care systems that employ a systematic assessment , rather than an ad hoc assessment , and this paper provides a starting point for this.
