In a sense, mind-body practices are thereby the salutogenetic mirror image of psychosomatic medicine, where psychophysiological and health consequences of specific psychological states, such as stress arousal, psychological trauma or depression, are studied. In this article, we aim to describe, elaborate and evaluate the philosophical background, rationale and value of Mind-Body-interventions. To place mind-body practices philosophically, it seems mandatory to us to discuss some issues around the mind-body problem. Some basic philosophical stances held by researchers and practitioners regarding this question might have a direct practical impact determining which mind-body practices are deemed useful and how they are being employed. Let us therefore start with a brief treatment of the mind-body problem before we consider some of the history and achievements of psychosomatic medicine. We then turn to some mind-body practices and their application, as well as the empirical database for them. 2. The Mind Body Problem [4](#B4-religions-03-00050)]. The first concerns the question of how consciousness and brain events are related. Is consciousness a consequence and therefore causally dependent on the brain and its functioning? Alternatively, can a case be made that consciousness and material brain processes are different in kind, as was believed by the founding father of experimental psychology, Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920)? In other words, is there a satisfying physical explanation for human consciousness? This is the classical mind-body problem. The second level we would like to term the 'spiritual part' of the mind-body problem. This deals with questions such as: is there some immaterial or even transcendental essence to human consciousness that could potentially even survive personal death? How can we understand certain spiritual experiences such as enlightenment experiences within the framework of a physicalist program? Our opinion is that it is useful to distinguish between these two levels of the problem, because frequently some personal spiritual or religious motives lie hidden behind seemingly simple philosophical questions [ [5](#B5-religions-03-00050)]. [5](#B5-religions-03-00050), [6](#B6-religions-03-00050)]. It was a hallmark of the surge of the scientific enterprise that physiologists replaced philosophers in tackling the question of how mental events come about by adopting a reductionist program, which was mainly inspired by Newtonian physics and mechanics, thereby reducing mental events to physical events in the brain. One historically important document is a famous letter written by Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896), destined to become one of the most famous and influential physiologists of his time. This letter that he wrote at the age of 26 to some friends notes a meeting in 1848 of some young researchers, who would all become highly influential thinkers. Among them was du Bois-Reymond and Ernst Br\u00fccke (18191892), the physiologist who later became the teacher and mentor of Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) in Vienna. \"Br\u00fccke and myself,\" the letter notes, \"have conspired to bring forth the truth that there are no other forces active in the human organism than the common chemical-physical ones. And where this is not sufficient as an explanation as yet, the mathematical method of physics needs to be applied in order to search for the way they are active in a concrete case, or else new forces have to be assumed which, however, have to be of the same dignity than the physical-chemical ones, also inherent in matter, and always to be reduced to attractive and repulsive forces.\" [1] [ [7](#B7-religions-03-00050)] This text delineates the program of physicalism: all explanations of mental events are to be reductions of physical laws, and hence mental events will eventually be explained by reference to physical events; much as physics was able to explain seemingly different events, such as lightning and magnetism as instances of electro-magnetism. Briefly, the brain was conceived as a complex but rather clockwork-like neuronal machine for producing thoughts and mental sensations. The eighteenth-century French physician Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis (1757-1808) expressed in a famous phrase \"the brain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile\". Mind then, in such a view, is simply a consequence of the complex neural assembly that forms our brain. Just how far such a physicalist program will be able to progress is still a matter of heavy debate. Some have said, and still keep saying, that we will not need a mentalist-psychological language any longer, as we will explain everything in terms of neuroscience [ [8](#B8-religions-03-00050)]. Similar to our saying \"a bolt of lightning has struck\" instead of using the more precise terminology \"a strong current of electricity has balanced the large potential difference between clouds and the earth\" we will still be talking about \"pain\", but will then have a precise definition and description of what it is to have pain in neuroscientific terms. There is a plethora of philosophical positions that differ in just how much of causal efficacy they attribute to our mental events [ [9](#B9-religions-03-00050)]. Some appear to be saying that our subjective impression of agency and will is just an illusion and that there is no such thing as real causal agency driving our mental life [ [10](#B10-religions-03-00050)]. Others would say that, although those mental events of will and causal activity are caused by our material substrate,i.e., the brain, these mental events, once produced, may have some causal repercussions on the physical system [ [11](#B11-religions-03-00050)]. [12](#B12-religions-03-00050)], and that, where certain brain functions have been damaged, very particular and specific mental functions have also been compromised. The study of coma and anesthesia, for instance, has shown which brain structures are necessary to sustain conscious awareness, and we know pretty well that if such essential structures as the brainstem are severely damaged then consciousness cannot be maintained or regained [ [13](#B13-religions-03-00050)]. We also know that long projection fibers ranging from the brain stem via the thalamus to the cortex seem to form circular structures that are necessary for the sustenance of conscious experience [ [14](#B14-religions-03-00050)]. If these thalamo-cortical loops are deranged, severe chronic pathologies, such as pain syndromes, may result [ [15](#B15-religions-03-00050)]. These pain syndromes can sometimes be influenced by diligent microsurgery in some areas of the thalamus [ [16](#B16-religions-03-00050)]. These and similar experiences have shown without any reasonable doubt that the brain certainly is necessary for consciousness to arise. [17](#B17-religions-03-00050), [18](#B18-religions-03-00050)]. [19](#B19-religions-03-00050)]. To date, not all of its function is clearly understood. Most has to do with the registering of nutrients and antigens in the bowel, being taken up by the blood, and with the regulation of peristaltic movement. It may well be the case that this complex neuronal system of gut regulation contributes to the tone and color to our consciousness, without us ever knowing [ [20](#B20-religions-03-00050)]. [21](#B21-religions-03-00050)]. Imbalances of the autonomic nervous system can severely affect our conscious experience [ [22](#B22-religions-03-00050)]. Chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndromes are two examples of how an imbalance in autonomic regulation,i.e., in a part of the nervous system that is largely outside the brain and does not contribute to consciousness as such, have a clear and perceptible impact on the sufferers' are always similar-neuron discharges and patterned firing of neurons, as well as chemical transmission of molecules, personal subjective experience is quite varied. One might want to use the differences in transmitter molecules to explain the differences in subjective phenomenology. However it may be argued that there are probably many more subjective feelings and tastes than can be accounted for by types of molecules or any mixture thereof. It is very difficult to jump from the hardwiring of neurochemistry and neurophysiology to the subjective feel of what it is like to be myself, or yourself, in any particular situation. Although we all know what pain is, it is quite something to think about pain, remember it, even empathize with someone who experiences pain, and having pain oneself. Moreover, pain defies the Cartesian taxonomy, as this phenomenon is actually something in between objective and subjective categories [ [32](#B32-religions-03-00050), [33](#B33-religions-03-00050)]. As a matter of fact, no knowledge about our pain-brain circuitry is able to help us understand what someone who suffers from severe chronic pain of a phantom limb actually feels. Although we may be able to describe this in a somewhat objectified manner, for example as abnormally strong patterns of theta-activity reverberations between some thalamo-cortical loops, and also see the result of a therapeutic intervention in the normalization of these patterns, these patterns themselves do not carry any of the subjective flavor of being in pain [ [16](#B16-religions-03-00050), [34](#B34-religions-03-00050), [35](#B35-religions-03-00050)]. It could also have been the correlate of a strong emotional reaction to one's grandmother. It only happened to be the correlate of strong pain, and nothing in itself tells us so, except the context of the research, and the private experience of the person who suffered from the pain in the first place. [36](#B36-religions-03-00050)]. This first-person singular, or subjective, view is categorically different from the third person view of scientific description and explanation. In the philosophical literature such phenomenological states have been termed \"qualia\", from the Latin \"how it is\", and it has been argued that as yet no way leads from a closed external description of the functioning of our brain to the subjective experience itself [ [37](#B37-religions-03-00050), [38](#B38-religions-03-00050)]. [4](#B4-religions-03-00050), [39](#B39-religions-03-00050), [40](#B40-religions-03-00050)]. Such a dualist first voiced by Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650), although Descartes was of course much more sophisticated than to merely postulate two substances. He was aware of the problem: If two completely different substances are unified within the human person, then they need a place of interaction [ [41](#B41-religions-03-00050)]. Descartes saw the pineal gland as this organ of interaction, whereas Wundt, relying on Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz' (1646-1716) metaphysical ideas of a pre-established harmony, developed the idea of psychophysical parallelism assuming that brain and mind states are two independent yet synchronized layers of description that are both necessary in order to understand and describe consciousness [ [5](#B5-religions-03-00050), [6](#B6-religions-03-00050)]. Modern proponents of dualist ontologies or solutions of the mind-body question also face the same problem [ [4](#B4-religions-03-00050), [5](#B5-religions-03-00050), [6](#B6-religions-03-00050)]. They have to say how such an interaction can happen in the first place. Some have made the point that the physiology of our brain, more precisely the synaptic vesicles, are of a size that might sustain quantum fluctuations such that our consciousness could actually use these physical events for the purpose of steering the physical make-up of our brain [ [42](#B42-religions-03-00050), [43](#B43-religions-03-00050)]. Others have pointed out that the micro-skeleton of the neurons, the so-called neurotubules, are of a size and geometry such as to sustain long-range coherence of electromagnetic vibrations\u2014similar to a laser\u2014which then collapse into a definite state in the act of consciousness [ [44](#B44-religions-03-00050), [45](#B45-religions-03-00050)]. [30](#B30-religions-03-00050), [46](#B46-religions-03-00050)]. [47](#B47-religions-03-00050), [48](#B48-religions-03-00050)]. Some documented experiences have apparently been reported by persons who have been clinically dead for more than 30 minutes [ [49](#B49-religions-03-00050)]. This is a period which would not allow the heart to keep the brain sufficiently provided with blood, oxygen and nutrients, and which would hence have resulted in a physiologically dead brain that, in theory, should not have been capable of consciousness. Hence, conscious experience of a person with such a physiologically dead brain would be a weighty counterargument against a [52](#B52-religions-03-00050), [53](#B53-religions-03-00050), [54](#B54-religions-03-00050)]. On this basis, they reinforce what, in the history of philosophy, has been termed idealism. This is the position that ultimately, mind or consciousness is the only \"real\" thing in the world, and matter is a consequence of, or derived from, consciousness. The German idealists Fichte, Schelling and Hegel were the last influential philosophers to hold such a view. In modern days some mathematicians and physicists sympathized with this view, and some esoteric and transpersonal ontologies that are influenced by Eastern philosophies adopt such an idealist mind-over-matter stance. In fact, most of Yoga or Hindu psychology can be seen as an attempt to work out such a world view. Needless to say, our modern scientific-physicalist program is not easily reconcilable with such an idealist position. On the contrary, it arose despite heavy philosophical criticism from idealist quarters. [38](#B38-religions-03-00050), [55](#B55-religions-03-00050)]. Dual aspect theories have a long tradition, going back at least to Spinoza in the 17th century. They suggest that mind and matter are just two expressions of the same basic stuff in the universe that happens to have a physical side and a mental side. Some, such as Plotinos in the 2nd century AD, have suggested a transcendental origin for this basic stuff. Others, such as the modern philosopher Feigl, have chosen not to address this question [ [56](#B56-religions-03-00050), [57](#B57-religions-03-00050)]. The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) held a similar position by saying that mental and physical events are unified by a common source he termed \"unusmundus\", using a notion from medieval alchemy [ [58](#B58-religions-03-00050)]. One potential model is to refer back to the basic structure of quantum mechanics, which uncovered complementarity as a basic structuring principle of the quantum realm. Nils Bohr, one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, pointed out that in order to describe matter properly we need to adopt notions that are at the same time maximally incompatible with each other, yet have to be applied to the same thing [ [59](#B59-religions-03-00050)]. This structure he called complementarity, borrowing a term from the psychology of his days [ [60](#B60-religions-03-00050)]. Bohr speculated that this structuring principle may be more general than just applicable to the description of processes in the quantum realm. Following Bohr, one could apply this notion to the relationship of mind and matter [ [61](#B61-religions-03-00050)], and, it should also be noted, also within consciousness itself, as one finds both emotional and cognitive aspects therein that are both necessary in order to explain the human condition. That is, that two maximally incompatible concepts that nevertheless have to be applied at the same time to describe one and the same thing: a conscious human being (or another animal, for that matter). Similarly to quantum mechanics, we do not have another way at talking about the underlying nature of the world than by using such complementary concepts as a heuristic template in order to grasp the complexity of the phenomenon in question. Neither would it make sense to forfeit one of the sides. There may still be an underlying unifying nature on an ontological level, but we ordinarily do not have epistemological access to it. Hence the world appears to us in these dual aspects of material and mental events which, however, are intimately related with each other. Various ways have been pointed out how this could be conceptualized properly, one being the assumption that mind and matter represent a breaking of an underlying symmetry [ [62](#B62-religions-03-00050)], another one being the idea that the basic structure of quantum mechanics might be applicable to other systems, as well [ [30](#B30-religions-03-00050), [31](#B31-religions-03-00050)]. Hence complementarity between mental and physical events could be orchestrated by non-local correlations, similar to quantum correlations proper. [63](#B63-religions-03-00050), [64](#B64-religions-03-00050), [65](#B65-religions-03-00050)], it is actually implicitly understood that a materialist ontology would not be compatible. Interestingly, by acknowledging the complementarist functions of cognitions and emotions, the principle of complementarity has been successfully employed to extend the scope of the traditional cognitive theories of mind and it has been suggested as a \"generative principle\" for explaining visual perception [ [66](#B66-religions-03-00050)]. Thus, it appears to us that a complementarist notion is a promising minimal meeting ground. It ascertains the reality and causal efficacy of mental events, yet does not buy into a dualist or idealist ontology and guarantees the unity of the human person at the same time, thus being true to the thrust of the scientific enterprise of finding unitary explanations and causes. Hence, for pragmatic reasons, we will adopt such a position for the remainder of this chapter. 3. Psychosomatic Medicine, Psycho-Neuro-Endocrinology and Psycho-Neuro-Immunology [67](#B67-religions-03-00050), [68](#B68-religions-03-00050), [69](#B69-religions-03-00050)]. Hence, balancing this animal magnetism through his magnetic strokes would create or at least restore health. It later emerged, when his followers and other neurologists took these discoveries further-Charcot, Bernheim and Janet-that despite all their conceptual differences what Mesmer had probably done was use psychological methods, such as suggestion and hypnosis, to affect the physiology of the body [ [6](#B6-religions-03-00050), [70](#B70-religions-03-00050), [71](#B71-religions-03-00050), [72](#B72-religions-03-00050)]. [71](#B71-religions-03-00050), [72](#B72-religions-03-00050)]. Moreover, he translated the most important book of Bernheim into German and not only named his oldest son Jean-Martin, but also wrote a favorable obituary of Charcot, although he was not very favorable towards another French psychologist, Pierre Janet (1859-1947). However, on closer scrutiny it turns out that a substantial amount of Freud`s seemingly original ideas are actually unaccredited developments of discoveries of these French giants [ [6](#B6-religions-03-00050), [73](#B73-religions-03-00050)]. Thus it is not a big surprise to find Freud theorizing and speculating about the possibility that mental problems and psychological trauma could express themselves in the body, or even use a secret code to express psychological problems physically. Although Freud developed only a rough outline, psychosomatic ideas are genuinely at the base of the psychoanalytic enterprise. If the psyche and the subconscious are to have any power at all, this power cannot stop where psychological phenomenology stops. It must reach into the realm of the body. This idea was developed further by Freud's followers and also those who effectively became psychoanalytical renegades. Alfred Adler (1870-1937), who initially considered himself a student and follower of Freud but then broke away, developed the concept of organ inferiority [ [70](#B70-religions-03-00050)]. This is the idea that the inferiority complex, which in Adler's view is one of the driving forces of positive striving as well as of neurosis, manifests also physically [ [74](#B74-religions-03-00050)]. From there it is only a small step to what Freud himself called \"organ language\", together with early psychoanalytically-inspired psychosomatic theorists, such and Georg Groddeck (1866-1934) [ [75](#B75-religions-03-00050)]. In the same way that neurosis uses symbols in dreams and thereby develops a certain language to manifest conscious experience, it may also use body function to express itself. Thus, anger that is \"swallowed\" may express itself as stomach ulcers, or implicit wishes to avoid sexual intercourse may express themselves as skin disease that discourages physical contact, and so on. [70](#B70-religions-03-00050)]. However, it has also uncovered multiple links between the psyche and the body and thereby potentially expanded the scope of a psychosomatic view. If anything, the psychosomatic view has been solidified and grown in importance by liaising with another important movement: systems theory. Systems theory is a theoretical movement that originated in Austria and Hungary around the 1930s. It was driven mainly by biologists, such as Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgy (1893-1986) and Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1901-1972), who were dissatisfied the reductionist view in biology [ [76](#B76-religions-03-00050), [77](#B77-religions-03-00050), [78](#B78-religions-03-00050)]. They argued that a living system is different from and more than just its constituent parts. From there it was only a small step to argue that such an abstract systemic view can be applied to a variety of systems. Thus, not only cells, plants and animals can be considered such systems, but also human beings. They not only comprise a physical system, but are also embedded in a social context that creates the meaning that is transported in their psychological world, both of which are intimately related to humans. Hence, systemically, there is not only an intimate connection between the mental and the physical, but also between those two dimensions and the social aspect. Thus a biopsycho-social view was increasingly applied to medical problems [ [79](#B79-religions-03-00050), [80](#B80-religions-03-00050)]. Such a view postulated that one had to consider not only the physical plane but also how this reflected the psychological situation and the social plane as well as their complex interdependencies. Such a systemic view was akin to what German psychosomatic medicine had been teaching since the early 20th century, developed out of the Heidelberg school, centering on Victor von Weizs\u00e4cker (1886-1957) [ [81](#B81-religions-03-00050)]. [75](#B75-religions-03-00050)]. While the crude links of early psychosomatic approaches turned out to be barren, the generic idea seemed to be fruitful and is still inspiring new research programs. Two important developments were instrumental. They are known as psycho-neuro-immunology and psycho-neuro-endocrinology. These terms denote the programs that try to uncover the links between the psychological system, the brain and the endocrine or the immunological systems respectively. Often, they are now considered one program, and it is mainly for disciplinary reasons that they are distinguished. [82](#B82-religions-03-00050), [83](#B83-religions-03-00050), [84](#B84-religions-03-00050)]. This showed that a supposedly independent immunological reaction, the immunosuppression produced by a pharmacological stimulus, could be classically conditioned. This meant that an immunologically irrelevant but psychologically relevant stimulus could be imbued with immunological meaning. If that was principally possible, then it was conceivable that a host of immunologically mediated responses, and hence diseases also, might be susceptible to conditioning. If rats could be conditioned to show an immunosuppressive reaction in a taste-aversion paradigm, then it was also conceivable that humans could show enhanced or suppressed immune reactions to aversive psychological stimuli [ [85](#B85-religions-03-00050)]. This opened, at least in principal, a route to understanding psychological concomitants of immunologically mediated diseases, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, colitis or Crohn's disease, to name but a few of the more important diseases. [86](#B86-religions-03-00050)]. Hence, what classically used to be seen as a hormone, is now considered to have multiple actions: , as a hormone, as an immunologically active molecule and as a molecule with central nervous system activity. In the same vein, it has been discovered that most of the distinctions previously considered instrumental are rather artificial, due to our ignorance or our failing theoretical models. While we have neither the competence nor the space to give a complete overview, it is sufficient for our purposes to simply note this thrilling fact that research has uncovered a multitude of links between the immune system, the brain and the endocrine system in both directions. This allows for an understanding, at least in principle, of the fact that the brain, and thereby the mental system, can have a direct influence on the body [ [87](#B87-religions-03-00050), [88](#B88-religions-03-00050)]. [89](#B89-religions-03-00050)]. On a threat stimulus, the threat is perceived through sensory input, which then via parts of the thalamus activates the locus coeruleus in the brain stem to stimulate the sympathetic adrenal medullary (SAM) axis [ [90](#B90-religions-03-00050)]. Adrenalin is injected into the blood stream within several hundreds of milliseconds by the adrenal gland [ [91](#B91-religions-03-00050)]. [92](#B92-religions-03-00050), [93](#B93-religions-03-00050)]. If a threat stimulus is detected, direct innervations of hypothalamic centers by amygdala neurons activate corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). This in turn stimulates the emission of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary [ [94](#B94-religions-03-00050)]. This then travels via the bloodstream to the adrenal gland, where, in the cortex of the adrenal, cortisol is released, starting the second phase of the stress response as briefly outlined above. Blood cortisol peak is reached roughly within 10-15 minutes after the perceived stress [ [95](#B95-religions-03-00050)]. [96](#B96-religions-03-00050)]. [97](#B97-religions-03-00050)]. The four maladaptive responses to a stressor are: (1) frequent exposure to stress, (2) inability to habituate to repeated challenges, (3) inability to terminate a stress response, (4) an inadequate response. In these four reaction types to challenge, the system accumulates high allostatic load as the cost of chronic exposure to elevated or fluctuating endocrine and neural responses. A high allostatic load is predictive of mortality and morbidity [ [89](#B89-religions-03-00050), [98](#B98-religions-03-00050)]. [99](#B99-religions-03-00050)]. Chronically elevated cortisol levels may have a host of immunological reactions. Cortisol in the short term stimulates the immune activity of some cells, but over a longer period has suppressive effects. Elevated stress levels might actually make the organism prone to either infections or deregulated immune responses and auto-immunological reactions, such as elevated inflammatory response. It is a well-known clinical fact that immunologically-mediated diseases such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis can be triggered or aggravated by stress or emotional upheavals [ [100](#B100-religions-03-00050), [101](#B101-religions-03-00050)]. Chronic immune suppression brought about by elevated cortisol levels might also contribute to some forms of cancer, where the immune system fails to attack some cells that have not destroyed themselves as they should have [ [102](#B102-religions-03-00050), [103](#B103-religions-03-00050)]. [104](#B104-religions-03-00050)]. The hippocampus also plays important roles in emotional regulation, and thus elevated cortisol levels may have powerful repercussions in affective tone. For instance, some forms of depression have been associated with chronically elevated cortisol levels [ [99](#B99-religions-03-00050)]. If cortisol levels are chronically elevated, or traumatic challenges of the stress-response system have been experienced in childhood, the responsivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) can be downregulated and hypocortisolism results [ [105](#B105-religions-03-00050)]. This is an inability of the system to respond adequately to stressors, either because of a fatiguing of the system or because of a protective mechanism against flooding with cortisol. Hypocortisolism is associated with chronic disease, such as atypical depression, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome or post traumatic stress disorder [ [106](#B106-religions-03-00050), [107](#B107-religions-03-00050)]. [108](#B108-religions-03-00050)]. It can be expected that in the near future, this research program will generate a more specific and detailed understanding of how some somatic diseases are linked to psychological states. In the next section, we consider the aspiration and the rationale of such interventions. 4. The Hope of Mind-Body Interventions [109](#B109-religions-03-00050), [110](#B110-religions-03-00050)]. Following this line of reasoning, Benson suggested that similar to the universal stress response that allows the organism to combat a wide variety of challenges and cope with all sorts of difficult situations through a circumscribed set of physiological reactions, there should also be an innate relaxation response that does the opposite: leading the organism back into a state of regeneration. Associated with the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, Benson and his associates studied a variety of techniques, mainly derived from meditation techniques, that would trigger such a relaxation reaction. The hallmark of this reaction is an activation of the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which is antagonistic to the sympathetic arm mediating the stress response [ [111](#B111-religions-03-00050)]. The main pathway to accessing and stimulating this is through the regulation of breathing. By regulating one's breathing the sympathetic activation can be modified and eventually countered [ [112](#B112-religions-03-00050)]. A slowing down in breathing slows down the heart rate. It also effects a dilation of blood vessels, mainly in the periphery, but also in the bowels. Glucose is moved back into depots, cortisol emission is down-regulated, endorphins are released, and as a consequence constitutive nitric oxide synthase is stimulated and nitric oxide (NO) is produced. NO is an immune, vascular and neural signaling molecule, and is itself bactericidal and antiviral. It scavenges free radicals and downregulates endothelial and immunocyte activation and adherence, thus performing vital physiological activities, including vasodilation [ [113](#B113-religions-03-00050)]. Thus, a comprehensive state of regeneration is triggered by this relaxation response [ [114](#B114-religions-03-00050)]. Most, if not all, beneficial effects of mind-body techniques are supposed to work through this generic mechanism of the relaxation response, according to this claim. They all influence breathing and heart rate, and thus exert a stimulating influence on the parasympathetic system. [21](#B21-religions-03-00050), [115](#B115-religions-03-00050), [116](#B116-religions-03-00050)]. While it is a reasonable assumption that some form of relaxation is germane to most, if not all, mind-body techniques, it might well be the case that more subtle changes that are difficult to measure or are exerted only centrally in the brain with very poor proxy measures in the periphery have so far evaded researchers. Pain often being a subjective phenomenon of immediate experiential directness might nevertheless be highly elusive locally, if the pain is not one secondary to a local inflammatory process but one that has generalized and is now due to a centrally mediated dysregulation of pain perception [ [117](#B117-religions-03-00050), [118](#B118-religions-03-00050)]. Effects of mind-body techniques on the experience of pain, for instance, will require more elaborate models of explanation than just the generic activity of the relaxation response. [119](#B119-religions-03-00050), [120](#B120-religions-03-00050)]. This is also true for chronic fatigue syndrome, for all chronic diseases with an involvement of dysfunctional immune-regulation, such as atopic diseases, and perhaps even for coronary heart disease and atherosclerotic diseases [ [121](#B121-religions-03-00050), [122](#B122-religions-03-00050), [123](#B123-religions-03-00050)]. It is certainly also valid for psychological disorders, such as anxiety and depressive disorders, and perhaps even for some compulsive disorders and potentially also for substance abuse disorders [ [88](#B88-religions-03-00050), [124](#B124-religions-03-00050), [125](#B125-religions-03-00050), [126](#B126-religions-03-00050)]. 5. A Typology of Mind-Body Techniques, Brief Descriptions and a Summary of the Evidence Base [Table 1](#religions-03-00050-t001)presents a summary classification for some of the more widely known Mind-Body Interventions. |Direction||Focus||Action||Body||Practice| |Transcendental Meditation||Self-directed with some emphasis no fixed duration| |Biofeedback||Self-directed with initial expert component||Focused||Direct||Emphasis||Supervised sessions until resolved or as needed| |Alexander Technique||Externally until resolved later self directed||Focused||Direct||Emphasis||Taught daily practice| |Mindfulness Meditation||Externally directed, later self directed||Initially focused, later wide focus||Indirect||Little emphasis||Supervised programs with daily practice| 5.1. Alexander Technique [127](#B127-religions-03-00050)]. This technique places a lot of emphasis on correct anatomical posture, mainly of the spine, but also for movements. It uses mental directives or self-suggestions (\"my neck is wide and free\") on top of teacher-directed movements to foster awareness of unfavorable movement and posture habits and eventually change them. It is suggested to be a helpful technique for all anatomy related pain problems, such as for chronic back pain, neck and shoulder pain or speech disorders. The Alexander Technique (AT) normally necessitates a series of single sessions until old movement patterns and postures have been unlearned and new movements incorporated. Later booster sessions are supposed to be beneficial. It is normally not possible to practice AT alone, except the self-hypnotic directives that are supposed to be integrated into daily movements. [128](#B128-religions-03-00050)]. Another review found no studies allowing conclusions on the efficacy of Alexander Technique in asthma [ [129](#B129-religions-03-00050)]. Our own randomized single-case study showed good effects in two patients with refractory stuttering [ [130](#B130-religions-03-00050)]. A recent Randomized Controlled Trial study with 597 patients suffering from persistent back pain provided an economic evaluation of therapeutic massage, exercise and lessons in the Alexander technique [ [131](#B131-religions-03-00050), [132](#B132-religions-03-00050)]. A combination of six lessons in the Alexander technique followed by exercise turned out to be the most effective and cost-effective option. 5.2. Qi Gong/Tai Chi [133](#B133-religions-03-00050)]. [134](#B134-religions-03-00050)]. [ [135](#B135-religions-03-00050)] showed that community-based Tai Chi interventions could reduce the fear of older people falling in community-accommodation. [136](#B136-religions-03-00050)] and cancer patients [ [137](#B137-religions-03-00050)]. It appears to have beneficial health effects, but due to the small number of studies and the lack of a theoretical foundation, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions [ [138](#B138-religions-03-00050)]. A recent review analyzing 40 studies where Tai Chi was utilized as a clinical intervention suggested improvements in psychological well-being including reduced stress, anxiety, depression and mood disturbance as well as increased self-esteem [ [139](#B139-religions-03-00050)]. It is also noteworthy that another review based on 13 randomized controlled trials recommended Tai Chi as an alternative treatment in older adults for improving balance and reducing falls, although it was not found to be superior to other interventions [ [140](#B140-religions-03-00050)]. A recent trial proved it effective for fibromyalgia [ [141](#B141-religions-03-00050)]. 5.3. Yoga Interventions [142](#B142-religions-03-00050), [143](#B143-religions-03-00050)] but not followed up, and a bibliography details the earlier research [ [144](#B144-religions-03-00050)]. Two recent reviews conclude that there is too little research for definitive conclusions, but that first results are encouraging [ [145](#B145-religions-03-00050), [146](#B146-religions-03-00050)]. Kundalini-Yoga has also shown effects in the evidence that meditation techniques (Meditation, Meditative Prayer, Yoga, Relaxation Response) might have health benefits, but that sound methodological studies are missing [ [154](#B154-religions-03-00050)]. However, a recent review that included more than 80 studies found that yoga interventions seemed to be equal or superior to exercise in most outcome parameters measured, except those involving physical fitness [ [155](#B155-religions-03-00050)]. Two recent trials proved Yoga efficient for the treatment of low back pain [ [156](#B156-religions-03-00050), and reviews comparing randomized studies conducted to date have been largely supportive [ [163](#B163-religions-03-00050)], with moderate to sizeable effect sizes between Cohen's d = 0.33 to d = 1.5 [ [159](#B159-religions-03-00050)]. Skeptics sometimes criticize the non-randomized nature of some of the evidence, for instance for less health care use [ [164](#B164-religions-03-00050), [165](#B165-religions-03-00050), [166](#B166-religions-03-00050)] or crime prevention [ [165](#B165-religions-03-00050), [166](#B166-religions-03-00050)]. However, the over-rigid adhesion to allegedly omnivalent quality standards derived from pharmacological trials may sometimes produce false negative conclusions [ [162](#B162-religions-03-00050)] due to the exclusion of studies that are deemed less valid or due to the insufficient expertise of reviewers in the content area itself [ [167](#B167-religions-03-00050)]. Overall, TM seems to be useful in stress reduction and secondarily in the lowering of blood pressure [ [168](#B168-religions-03-00050)] (although this has been doubted [ [162](#B162-religions-03-00050)]), and in the prevention of coronary artery disease [ [169](#B169-religions-03-00050)]. A series of promising single studies has shown the effects of TM on blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors [ [170](#B170-religions-03-00050), [171](#B171-religions-03-00050), [172](#B172-religions-03-00050), [173](#B173-religions-03-00050), [176](#B176-religions-03-00050), [177](#B177-religions-03-00050), [178](#B178-religions-03-00050)], and a recent review suggested that TM may have the potential to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a clinically meaningful way [ [179](#B179-religions-03-00050)]. 5.5. The Relaxation Response [180](#B180-religions-03-00050)]. Posture is less important and a specific content-less state of mind is not the target of the technique, but simply relaxation. Some of the research shows that even this comparatively reduced program seems to have some effects [ [181](#B181-religions-03-00050), [182](#B182-religions-03-00050), [183](#B183-religions-03-00050), [184](#B184-religions-03-00050), [185](#B185-religions-03-00050), [186](#B186-religions-03-00050)]. A recent meta analysis embracing 27 studies found that relaxation training showed a medium-large effect size in the treatment of anxiety [ [187](#B187-religions-03-00050)]. 5.6. Mindfulness Meditation [188](#B188-religions-03-00050), [189](#B189-religions-03-00050)]. Mindfulness is both active (actively observing) and passive (not reacting towards what is observed) and in this and other aspects it is dialectical [ [188](#B188-religions-03-00050)]. While the original practice clearly is religious in intent in that it was supposed to be a means to free oneself from suffering through enlightenment, the modern adoptions often use just the technique without the religious and philosophical background. One of the most popular adoptions is Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)[ [2](#B2-religions-03-00050)] and two further developments, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) [ [190](#B190-religions-03-00050)], which is a program for depression relapse therapy, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy [ [191](#B191-religions-03-00050)], in which the principles of mindfulness have been included into a specialized program of therapy for borderline patients. A common feature of these programs is that they use principles of mindfulness and teach formal mindfulness meditation to patients, urging them to daily practice at least within the eight-week programs. In a meta-analysis published in 2003 of studies on MBSR, Baer et al. found an effect size of d = 0.70 for anxiety and d = 0.84 for depression [ [192](#B192-religions-03-00050)]. We found in a meta analysis published in 2004 that MBSR was effective in improving psychological and physical health outcomes across various diseases with an effect size of d = 0.53, which can be considered a medium effect that is worthwhile, considering the chronicity of the diseases studied [ [193](#B193-religions-03-00050)]. However, a more recent meta-analysis published by Bohlmeijer et al., based on 8 studies of moderate to good quality investigating the effect of MBSR on mental health of adults with a chronic medical disease, found only smaller effect sizes ranging from d = 0.47 for anxiety and d = 0.26 for depression [ [194](#B194-religions-03-00050)]. In a similar way, MBCT proved effective in preventing relapse in patients with recurrent depression in controlled studies [ [195](#B195-religions-03-00050), [196](#B196-religions-03-00050), [197](#B197-religions-03-00050)] but is at present not seen as a completely reliable intervention by others, as the results of studies are equivocal [ [198](#B198-religions-03-00050)]. [199](#B199-religions-03-00050), [200](#B200-religions-03-00050)], one of our patients said: \"I have been bossed around by my pain all my life. Now I just don't bother any longer and go on holidays.\" It was the first time this lady had taken some time out for more than 20 years. She did not go without pain, but with more freedom. 6. Final Remarks and Conclusions [201](#B201-religions-03-00050)]. Most mindbody techniques seem to be effective, although conclusive statements cannot be made as yet. They are popular, because patients intuitively want this holistic approach. They seem to understand sometimes more clearly than their physicians that part of their physical problem may be due to some emotional-mental ailment and that treating this mental realm might also be beneficial for their bodies. Although we are only slowly beginning to understand how the interconnections between the psyche and the body operate, due to our greater knowledge of the immunological and endocrinological connections between the brain and the periphery, in principle, we have enough knowledge to understand how stressful and soothing, noci-ceptive and healing reactions and influences can travel either way. Hence, it seems natural also to employ these mind-body techniques as therapeutic options. It is clearly more difficult to study those techniques as they are always complex interventions, operating with an array of potential specific and non-specific effects. Such complex interventions cannot be studied by simple research designs modeled along the lines of pharmaceutical interventions [ [202](#B202-religions-03-00050), [203](#B203-religions-03-00050)]. Rather, they need a diligent, stepwise approach in which general effectiveness is established first, before dismantling trials might be able to tackle the question about which component might be important and which component could be dispensed with. A lot of time, money and effort have to be put into research programs like that, and considering the limited amount of funding available it will take a score of years until we have the desired, firm knowledge base. Until then, we will have to rely on proxy-studies and proof of principle evidence. This we have. We have enough knowledge in general to be confident that some of the techniques\u2014meditation and mindfulness relaxation, and body work\u2014can be beneficially employed. Here as elsewhere, these techniques will only be beneficial if patients themselves see a point in involving their mental and psychological lives in their healing process. If they do, a mind-body technique might be the first step towards more wholeness and healing, as patients understand that it does not make sense to cure the body without tackling their psychological wounds and vice-versa. We are therefore of the opinion that mind-body techniques constitute a superior approach to attaining holistic health.
