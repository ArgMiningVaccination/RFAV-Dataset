However, scientists have described the marketing campaign as \"shocking\" and warned that patients' lives are at risk from relying on homoeopathy, which they claim is \"scientific nonsense\". The row comes after the British Medical Association (BMA) denounced homoeopathic remedies as \"witchcraft\" and called for them to be marked as placebos with no provable clinical effect to stop customers being misled. The BMA and other organisations have also demanded that homoeopathy be scrapped from the NHS, which spends around \u00a34 million a year on the treatment. Ainsworths was highlighted in an investigation by the BBC's Newsnight programme, which obtained a leaflet from the store claiming its travel disease remedies had been used \"successfully throughout the world\". The brochure included the caveat that the treatments had not been tested in clinical trials, so \"we are unable to make claims for the effectiveness of this method\". Jayne Lawrence, chief scientific adviser of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS), said: \"We are very, very shocked that this leaflet is actually available. \"The RPS has been very strong and made it very clear that we do not support the use of homoeopathy, and in fact there is no scientific evidence to support their use, nor any clinical data to support their use over and above as a placebo. \"We would be very concerned if a patient took a homoeopathic preparation to travel to an area where they may be yellow fever, typhoid, malaria, believing they were safe when in fact they wouldn't be safe because they wouldn't be protected against these diseases and would be susceptible to getting them.\" Critics have accused the Government of a muddled approach to homoeopathy after the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, banned the treatments from being referred to as \"medicines\" for animals, while the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has insisted there is no need for such a move to protect humans. An MHRA spokesman said: \"The greatest threat posed by homoeopathy is that it may be advocated for the treatment or prevention of serious conditions. \"In recent years we have removed from the market homoeopathic products being promoted for the prevention of malaria and the treatment of cancer.\" The RPS has urged the MHRA to ban homoeopathic treatments from being called \"medicines\" and backed calls to withdraw them from the NHS. The NHS has funded homoeopathy since the service was set up in 1948, running homoeopathic hospitals, which care for an estimated 55,000 patients annually. Many of these patients have conditions which are not helped through other NHS treatments, according to homoeopathy supporters. Last year a report from the Commons science and technology select committee called on the NHS to stop funding the treatments, which it claimed were not medicines. Ainsworths, which holds a Royal warrant from the Prince of Wales, was last night unavailable for comment. "}
