In accomplishing this mission, The University Graduate School values excellence, integrity, collaboration, efficiency, innova - tion, and inclusiveness in all that it does. These values are central to the school's role in encouraging a creative environ - ment for scholarship, research, teaching and learning. The University Graduate School is a recognized leader in develop - ing new concepts and best practices for graduate education. It assists departments in recruiting, supporting, retaining, and graduating outstanding scholars. Through its connections with national higher education organizations, it serves as a resource in forging the future directions of graduate education. The University Graduate School administers degree programs on six campuses of Indiana University: Bloomington, Fort Wayne, Kokomo, Indianapolis, South Bend, and Southeast at New Albany. At Bloomington there are certificate programs in the College of Arts and Sciences and in the School of Informat - ics and master's programs in the College of Arts and Sciences. There are Ph.D. programs and/or Ph.D. minors in the College of Arts and Sciences, the Jacobs School of Music, the Kelley School of Business, the School of Education, the School of Informat - ics, the School of Law, the School of Library and Information Science, the School of Optometry, and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. At Indianapolis the programs administered by the Indiana University Graduate School include certificates in the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, the School of Liberal Arts, the School of Medicine, and the School of Public and Environ - mental Affairs. Master's programs in the School of Liberal Arts, Health and Rehabilitation Sciences , and the School of Science. Ph.D. programs and/or Ph.D. minor progams are available in the School of Informatics, School of Nursing and the School of Social Work. The School of Dentistry, the School of Liberal Arts, School of Medicine, and the School of Public and Environmen - tal Affairs offer both master's and Ph.D. or Ph.D. minor pro - grams. Fort Wayne and Kokomo offer master's programs in their Schools of Arts and Sciences. Masters of Liberal Studies are available at South Bend and at Southeast. History and Organization In 1908, upon the insistence of faculty members of the Col - lege of Arts and Sciences, the university placed its graduate courses into a newly formed unit, the Graduate School, and named biology professor Carl Eigenmann its first dean (1908- 27). Four years later, Indiana University gave its first Ph.D. degree, although Master of Arts degrees had been conferred in cursu upon graduates of Indiana University in the nineteenth century. Today, the Graduate School awards approximately 300 Ph.D.'s and some 500 master's degrees annually. In addition to the Ph.D., the Graduate School at Indiana University has sole jurisdiction over the Master of Arts, the Master of Science, the Master of Arts for Teachers, the Master of Laws, and the Master of Fine Arts degrees wherever they are offered in the university system. The professional schools have jurisdiction over other postbaccalaureate degrees and, of course, provide the instruction for Graduate School degrees in their disciplines. As a university-wide office, the Graduate School grants degrees at five of the university's eight campuses: Bloomington, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, South Bend, and Southeast. In the Graduate School's early years, during the presidency of William Lowe Bryan, the university concentrated on under - graduate instruction. When Herman B. Wells became president in 1938, graduate education at Indiana began to thrive under the deanship of Fernandes Payne, another biologist (1927- 47). With the strong support of President Wells and under the guidance of Dean Payne's successors, English professor and folklorist Stith Thompson (1947-50) and botanist Ralph Cle - land (1950-58), the Graduate School grew rapidly during the post-World War II years. Twenty-five graduate fellowships were created during the war years. John W. Ashton, the second English professor to occupy the Graduate School deanship (1958-65), had served as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences before taking over the new Gradu - ate School offices in Kirkwood Hall. During his tenure in the college and in the Graduate School, Dean Ashton gave strong support to interdisciplinary programs and emerging disciplines such as linguistics, comparative literature, East European stud -6ies, folklore, School of Letters, and Uralic and Altaic studies. By 1960, Bernard Berelson's book Graduate Education in the United States ranked Indiana University twelfth of 92 institu - tions of higher education. Allan Carter's Assessment of Qual - ity in Graduate Education (1966) also reflected the increased stature of the university's graduate programs. In that work, four Graduate School programs ranked among the top ten of their kind in the nation, and twenty programs emerged among the top twenty. The appointment of Harrison Shull, a chemist (1965-72), marked an outstanding increase in the research and graduate development activities of the Graduate School. When Dean Shull left the Graduate School to become the vice chancellor for research and development, he took many of these activities with him, leaving the Graduate School to be primarily con - cerned with graduate education. As the university underwent reorganization under the leadership of President John W. Ryan, two temporary deans, Harry Yamaguchi, a psychologist (1972- 77), and James Holland, the third biologist to head the Gradu - ate School (1977-78), presided over an office that, without a research and development component, was able to focus its attention on the quality of graduate education. From 1978 until 1987, the historian Leo F. Solt was dean. Under his leadership, the Graduate School became a university-wide entity, encouraging excellence in graduate education through - out the state of Indiana by systematically reviewing all existing programs and by implementing new graduate programs on the Indianapolis and South Bend campuses, as well as on the Bloomington campus. Fellowship funds were increased, and more minority students were recruited; the Graduate School was computerized to improve record keeping and monitoring of students; additional steps were taken to improve the quality of Ph.D. dissertations; and participation by graduate students in the administrative and policy making activity of the Graduate School was encouraged. Thomas Noblitt, a music historian, was acting dean from 1987 until 1989. During his tenure, new graduate programs were ap - proved for the Northwest and Fort Wayne campuses, and offer - ings at Bloomington and Indianapolis were expanded. In August 1989, George Walker, a physicist, became associate vice presi - dent (and later vice president) for research and dean of The University Graduate School, thus reuniting two offices that had been separated for nearly 20 years. Under his direction, The University Graduate School was reorganized to allow depart - ments and schools to assume a larger part of the responsibility for the monitoring of graduate students' progress toward their degrees. Increased emphasis on financial support for gradu - ate education has led to substantial additions to the fellowship budget, new initiatives were undertaken to encourage research on all campuses of the university, and the Graduate Council was significantly expanded. Dean Walker has also established a Preparing Future Faculty Program to prepare graduate students for the full range of professional responsibilities they will face. In 2003, the Office of Research and The University Graduate School were again separated, and John Slattery, a pharmacolo - gist from the University of Washington, was recruited to head the again independent University Graduate School. Unfortu - nately he was lured back by the University of Washington, and in the fall of 2005, Sherry Queener (who had been Associate Dean at Indianapolis) and Eugene R. Kintgen (who had been Associate Dean at Bloomington) were named Acting Co-Deans. James C. Wimbush, a professor of business administration, was appointed Dean of The University Graduate School in 2006. In 1951, the faculty elected nine of their number to a Graduate Council. Today, the Graduate Council has 35 voting members elected by The University Graduate School faculty. That faculty of about 2,200 members comes from all campuses of the uni - versity. Beginning in 1980, a University Graduate School faculty committee has selected new members of the graduate faculty upon nomination by departmental or school administrators, subject to the approval of the dean of The University Graduate School and, in the case of full members, the Board of Trust - ees. This process changed in 2005. Currently, all tenured or tenure-eligible faculty are automatically appointed as members of the Graduate Faculty. An additional endorsement to direct doctoral dissertations can be obtained by nomination by the appropriate doctoral program chair or program faculty, subject to approval of the Dean of The University Graduate School. The names of all IU faculty members who hold appointments as members of the Graduate Faculty are listed under the names of the program(s) with which they are associated. An asterisk (*) denotes membership in The University Graduate School faculty with the endorsement to direct doctoral dissertations. Members of The University Graduate School faculty ultimately determine standards of admission, set the general require - ments for degrees, pass upon the specific requirements of programs, approve courses for graduate credit, and certify candidates for degrees. These functions are executed by the Graduate Council and the dean and administrative staff. More specifically, The University Graduate School faculty serve on advisory and research committees for doctoral students, direct master's theses and doctoral dissertations, and elect members of the Graduate Council. The Graduate Council, which represents faculty in all gradu - ate units, meets monthly during the academic year. In ad - dition to the functions delegated to it by the faculty of The University Graduate School, it serves as an executive advisory body to the dean and administrative staff on policy matters. It receives the reports of the school's standing faculty commit - tees; it acts upon recommendations for changes in admission, the curriculum, degree requirements, and procedures for the administration of student programs; it receives and acts upon the recommendations of ad hoc committees appointed by the dean; it gives advice on ways to improve the quality of gradu - ate work; and it seeks ways to coordinate the programs of The University Graduate School with other graduate programs in the university. In addition, the deans and staff of The University Graduate School monitor indicators of the quality of individual graduate programs , and (through the recorders) the quality of master's and doctoral degrees granted. Mentoring and Preparing Future Faculty programs, both within the departments and centralized in The University Graduate School, ensure that these students 7are integrated into their academic programs and prepared for the full range of professional responsibilities they will encoun - ter in their careers. The Graduate and Professional Student Organization is the representative body for graduate students enrolled on the Bloomington campus. Likewise, the Graduate Student Organiza - tion represents graduate students enrolled in programs on the Indianapolis campus. Both organizations work with The Univer - sity Graduate School to advocate for the interests of graduate and professional students.8University Graduate School 2009-2010 Academic Bulletin Admission Undergraduate Requirements The University Graduate School will consider applications from students holding baccalaureate degrees from Indiana Univer - sity or from other accredited four-year collegiate institutions. The University Graduate School may admit students who do not meet stated admission criteria provided that the deficien - cies amount to no more than one year's work. The dean will determine the condition of admission in such cases. If more than a year's work is deficient, students should apply to the University Graduate School for admission to the Continuing Nondegree Program. Students from unaccredited institutions may be admitted as special students for one semester; if their records are then satisfactory and their department, program, or school recommends them, they will be given full standing. Ordinarily, a B (3.0) average in the undergraduate major is required for admission to the University Graduate School. Distance/Distributed Education The University Graduate School recognizes the role in contem - porary curricula of modern technologies that enhance learn - ing in both traditional formats featuring primarily face-to-face interaction and in non-traditional formats where students and faculty engage each other primarily via electronic means. In considering course work for admission purposes or for transfer of credit into a degree program, the Graduate School expects programs to evaluate course work and to apply the same criteria for quality to both traditional and distance formats. Course work must be from an accredited four-year collegiate institution to be considered for admission purposes, or must otherwise comply with the requirements for non-accredited institutions (see prior section). Indiana University Baccalaureate Degree Candidates Candidates for baccalaureate degrees at Indiana University may apply for conditional admission to the University Graduate School and may enroll for graduate credit for that portion of their program not required for completion of the baccalaureate degree, provided that: 1. They are within one semester of meeting baccalaureate degree requirements. (If the baccalaureate is not completed within that semester, graduate credit earned may not be counted toward an advanced degree). 2. The total course load does not exceed that ordinarily taken by a full-time graduate student. 3. The courses taken for graduate credit are authorized to carry such credit. (In certain instances graduate credit is al - lowed for undergraduate courses.) Application To assure that course credit will be eligible to count toward an intended graduate degree, prospective graduate students, including graduates of Indiana University, must make formal application and be admitted to a department, program, or academic school, or must be registered as a continuing nonde - gree student before taking courses for graduate credit. Most programs of the University Graduate School consider applica - tions for admission and financial aid that are completed by the following dates: January 15 for the fall semester, September 1 for the spring semester, and January 1 for the summer. If a program uses other deadlines, the applicant will be informed by the staff of the program. Many graduate programs consider applications submitted after a deadline as long as all available spaces for students have not been filled by highly qualified applicants. Inquiries about late applications for admission or financial aid should be addressed to the program of the stu - dent's intended major. Electronic applications are the preferred form of application at IU Bloomington. If needed, paper application forms are avail - able in the office of the University Graduate School, Kirkwood Hall 111, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405, in the IUPUI Graduate Office, IUPUI, Union Building 207, 620 Union Street, Indianapolis, IN 46202, and in departmental offices. For further information, consult www.gradapp.indiana.edu. All applications must be accompanied by one complete transcript of previous college and university work and should be submit - ted directly to the department in which the student wishes to work. Indiana University graduates should request the regis - trar's office to send unofficial copies of their transcripts to that department.

An applica - tion fee of $55 (2009-2010) is required for all applicants apply - ing to Indiana University Graduate School programs on the IUB campus and $50 on the IUPUI campus. All Graduate Nondegree students on the Indianapolis campus must pay a $50 (2009- 2010) application fee as well. At IU Bloomington, Continuing Nondegree Program students are not assessed an application fee, but a $25 processing fee is assessed each semester in which they enroll. Admission (except for Continuing Nondegree students) is made to a particular department for a specific degree, and no student shall be permitted to work toward a degree without first having been admitted to do so. A flexible entry procedure for basic science programs at Indianapolis allows Ph.D. students up to one year to identify a research laboratory and degree pro - gram. Students desiring to change departments should fill out Transfer of Department Forms, which may be obtained in the offices of individual departments or schools (e.g., the School of Education, the College of Arts and Sciences). Requests for change of degree status must be submitted by the department and approved by the dean. Following the notice of admission to the University Graduate School, an applicant normally has two calendar years in which to enroll. Supplementary transcripts of any additional aca - demic work undertaken during that period are required, and a department may request additional letters of recommendation. Should the updated material prove unsatisfactory, the admis - sion may be cancelled. If the applicant fails to enroll within two years, a completely new application is required. Graduate Record Examination Applicants may be required to take the Graduate Record Exami - nation General Test, Subject Test, or both (see departmental requirements). Information concerning these examinations may be obtained online at www.ets.org . Further information is available in the office of the University Graduate School (IUB) or at the Graduate Office (IUPUI). International Students There are special application procedures for those who are not citizens of the United States or who have had their previ - ous schooling outside the United States. At IU Bloomington, international students can apply online at http://www.gradapp. indiana.ed u or obtain the International Paper Packet from the Office of Admissions at Bloomington (300 N. Jordan Ave; [812] 855-4306; e-mail intladm@indiana.edu ) or the Office of International Affairs at IUPUI (902 W. New York St., ES 2126; [317] 274-7000; E-mail intlaff@iupui.edu ; the international application may be downloaded from www.iupui.edu/~oia/ ). Because of the extra procedures required in evaluating foreign credentials, the application fee for international students is $60 (IUB and IUPUI). Once enrolled, international students who wish to change their programs of study must first obtain the approval of the Office of International Services. After such approval is granted, application for formal change of status may be made to the University Graduate School according to the same procedures governing United States citizens. International students must enroll in at least 8 credit hours each fall and spring semester in order to meet visa require - ments. Any exceptions to this regulation must be approved in advance by the Office of International Services. Since the language of instruction at Indiana University is English, proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and under - standing English is essential. Applicants whose native language is not English should submit proof of such proficiency by the time they apply for admission. Normally this is done by taking the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Results of this test should be submitted as part of the application for admission. The TOEFL examination is given six times a year in the United States and many foreign countries. Further informa - tion may be obtained at American consulates or by writing to TOEFL, Box 899, Princeton, NJ 08541, U.S.A. If it is not possible to take the TOEFL, applicants should obtain a statement by a responsible official, ordinarily a United States consular official, attesting that they read, write, speak, and understand the Eng - lish language well enough to pursue, at an American university, a program leading to an advanced degree in their chosen field. Such a statement should be submitted with the application for admission. Prior to registration for classes, all new students whose native language is not English are required to take an English Lan - guage Proficiency Test administered by the Indiana University Center for English Language Training (CELT) at Bloomington, and by the ESL program and the Office of International Affairs at Indianapolis. If the results of this test indicate that a stu - dent needs additional work in English as a second language, appropriate recommendations will be made to the student's academic advisors. This requirement has been established in recognition of the vital importance of language competency to the student's academic success. Prospective students whose native language is not English and who have been offered posi - tions as associate instructors are required to pass additional tests in English, since success as a teacher at Indiana University is dependent upon one's ability to communicate in the English language. Information regarding these examinations may be obtained directly from the individual academic departments at IU Bloomington or from the Graduate Office at IUPUI. Nondegree Students Special Students Students who have not been admitted to a degree program but who intend to study primarily in one department may be admitted by that department with the approval of the dean as special students. They must apply to a department just as 10degree students do and should indicate their desired status. Continuing Nondegree Students The holder of a baccalaureate degree who wishes to study on a nondegree basis without necessarily concentrating in a single department may be admitted to the University Gradu - ate School as a continuing nondegree student. Such students may not accumulate more than 18 credit hours in a single subject area, and may enroll only in those courses for which they can obtain specific permission to register, which takes into consideration the academic background of the individual and course enrollment limitations. In addition to Indiana University tuition and mandatory fees, a program processing fee of $25 is assessed each semester. For details of admission and further information, students should consult the University Graduate School at Bloomington (Kirkwood Hall 111, [812] 855-4010, nondegr@indiana.edu ) or the Graduate Nondegree Program at (620 Union Drive, Room 207, [317] 274-1577, www.iupui.edu/~gradoff/gnd/ . A student initially admitted as a continuing nondegree student who later wishes to obtain a graduate degree must make for - mal application and be admitted to a departmental degree pro - gram. The department may then recommend to the dean that credit earned as a continuing nondegree student be applied to degree requirements. Students should be aware that certain departments and schools specifically prohibit work taken under continuing nondegree status from counting toward a degree after a student has been admitted to a degree program.11University Graduate School 2009-2010 Academic Bulletin Academic RegulationsUniversity Graduate School Kirkwood Hall 111 Indiana University Bloomington, IN 47405 (812) 855-8853 Contact: grdschl@indiana.edu Graduate Office Union Building 207 Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Indianapolis, IN 46202 (317) 274-1577 Contact: gradoff@iupui.edu Residence All candidates for graduate degrees (with the exceptions out - lined below) must complete at least 30 credit hours of gradu - ate work while enrolled on campuses of Indiana University. Of these hours, at least one semester or two summer sessions of full-time work must be taken in University Graduate School degree-granting units on the Bloomington, Fort Wayne, India - napolis, South Bend, or Southeast campuses. Candidates for the Ph.D. degree must spend two consecutive semesters during one academic year on the Bloomington or Indianapolis campus. Work Done at More Than One Indiana University Campus Students who plan to earn a degree through a degree-granting unit on one Indiana University campus and who plan to take a substantial number of hours on one or more of the other Indiana University campuses in partial fulfillment of degree requirements should have their programs of study approved in advance by the degree-granting unit. The residency require - ment must be met on the campus where the degree-granting unit is located. Committee on Institutional Cooperation Traveling Scholar Program This program enables Indiana University doctoral-level students to take advantage of special resources available at other CIC institutions1 that do not exist at Indiana University. Students in the program register and pay fees at Indiana University but attend one or more of the participating institutions, each for no more than two semesters or three quarters. To view a list of all participating campuses, as well as eligibility requirements, program details, and online application information, please visit the Web site www.cic.net/Home/Projects/SharedCourses/ TScholar/Introduction.aspx . For further information, contact the University Graduate School office. Auditing Students may register for courses on an auditing basis. Courses in which a student is so enrolled carry no credit but are listed on the student's transcript. An auditing fee is charged. Full-Time Study Ordinarily, students shall be considered full time if they are registered for 8 hours of credit (fall, spring, and summer terms) and their programs of study meet with the approval of the departments. Courses taken as an auditor may not be counted in the definition of \"full-time study\"; however, courses taken to remove undergraduate deficiencies for admission may be counted. Students holding appointments as associate instructors, gradu - ate assistants, or research assistants must ordinarily be regis - tered for 6 credit hours during each full semester. For academic purposes, the University Graduate School will consider as full-time certain students who are exceptions to the above definitions: M.A. and M.S. candidates whose completed courses and deferred thesis credits total 30 hours; M.F.A. can - didates whose completed courses and deferred thesis credits total 60 hours; and Ph.D. students whose completed courses and deferred dissertation credits total 90 hours, providing they are working on theses or dissertations for the completion of the degree. Such students, however, must enroll in at least one hour of graduate thesis (for master's students) or dissertation (for doctoral students) credit each semester. For master's can - didates, such enrollment will be limited to the five-year period allowed for completion of the master's degree; this enrollment for doctoral candidates will be limited to the seven-year period after passing the qualifying examination. Students who have already accumulated 90 or more hours of graduate credit and who hold university-administered student appointments as associate instructors, graduate assistants, or research assistants amounting to at least 0.375 FTE (15 hours per week workload) will be required to enroll for at least 6 hours of credit during each semester they continue to hold an appointment. Such hours will be charged at the allocated fee rate. Students may take no more than 16 hours of credit in any semester or more than a total of 16 credit hours in all the summer sessions in any one year without permission of their graduate advisor. Students who are employed are advised to take into account the demands that such activities make on their time and to reduce their course loads accordingly. 12Transfer from One Department to Another Matriculated students wishing to transfer from one depart - ment within the University Graduate School to another should first consult their graduate advisors or advisory committees and the graduate advisor of the new department about the wisdom of the change. International students desiring to make such a change must also obtain the approval of the Office of International Services. Application to the new department may then be made using the Application for Transfer of Depart - ment within the University Graduate School form, available in individual departments and schools. Students expecting to re - ceive a degree from the department they are transferring from should be sure that the effective date of the transfer falls after the degree will be conferred, since degrees can be conferred only in the department in which the student is enrolled. Graduate Credit\u2014General Only courses listed in this bulletin or specifically allowed by it may be counted toward the requirements for a degree offered by the University Graduate School. These courses are ordinarily numbered at the 500 level or above. In certain cases, courses at the 300 and 400 level have been specifically approved for graduate credit; all such courses are listed in this bulletin. Nor - mally, these courses require a higher level of performance and significantly more work (such as an increased number of read - ings, additional papers, extra class sessions, oral class presenta - tions) for the graduate students than for the undergraduates. Each instructor should identify the graduate students enrolled in the course during the first week of classes and should out - line the nature of the work expected of them at that time. In certain other unusual instances the dean may approve, upon recommendation and justification by the student's advisory committee, other 300- or 400-level courses for graduate credit, typically to count toward requirements in the student's outside minor. Such approval should be requested before the course is taken. In many departments there are strict limitations on the number of 300- and 400-level courses that may be counted toward advanced degree requirements; see departmental notices for details. For descriptions of 300- and 400-level courses, see the College of Arts and Sciences Bulletin or the School of Liberal Arts Bulletin. Not all courses listed in this bulletin are offered every year and on every campus. Inquiries concerning the availability or suit - ability of a particular course should be directed to the appropri - ate departmental chairperson. The number of hours of credit given a course is indicated in pa - rentheses following the course title. The abbreviation \"P\" refers to the course prerequisite or prerequisites. Similarly, the ab - breviation \"R\" indicates recommended prerequisites. Courses eligible for a deferred grade are marked by the sign \"**\". Courses taken while an undergraduate and counted toward the requirements of a baccalaureate degree may not also be counted toward a graduate degree. With only three exceptions, courses counted toward the requirements for one advanced degree may not be counted toward requirements for another degree at the same level. In the case of the M.F.A., course work completed as part of an M.A., M.S., or M.A.T. degree may, with the approval of the student's department, be counted toward the M.F.A., provided it otherwise meets the conditions stated in this bulletin. In the case of the Dual Master's Program, certain reductions are allowed in the total number of hours required if the two degrees had been taken separately. The Dual Master's Program involves two degrees at the master's level; the degrees may be under the jurisdiction of the University Graduate School or of another school (e.g., Journalism, Library and Information Science, Public and Environmental Affairs). For further informa - tion, see below (under Requirements for Master's Degrees) and the departmental entries for Central Eurasian Studies, Comparative Literature, East Asian Languages and Cultures, Economics, Environmental Programs, Fine Arts, Folklore and Ethnomusicology, Geography, History, History and Philosophy of Science, Journalism, Latin American and Caribbean Stud - ies, Library and Information Science, Music, Nursing Science, Philanthropic Studies, Russian and East European Institute, and West European Studies. Work counted toward a master's degree may also be counted toward the Ph.D. if it has been approved by the student's advi - sory committee and if it otherwise meets the conditions stated in this bulletin, including the rules governing the transfer of credit from other institutions. Transfer of Credit Upon recommendation of the department and with the ap - proval of the dean, work taken for graduate credit at other institutions may be transferred in partial fulfillment of degree requirements. No course may be transferred from another institution unless the grade is B or higher and unless the course was completed within the time limit prescribed (see \"Gradu - ate Credit\u2014General\" section below). The following restrictions apply: 1. Candidates for the M.A., M.S., LL.M., or M.A.T. degree may offer up to 8 hours of graduate credit from other institu - tions. 2. Candidates for the M.A.T. degree who are graduates of Indiana University may offer up to 12 hours of graduate credit from other institutions. 3. Candidates for the M.F.A. degree may offer up to 20 hours of graduate credit from other institutions. 4. Candidates for the Ph.D. degree may offer up to 30 hours of graduate credit from other institutions. It must be emphasized that the transfer of credit is not an au - tomatic occurrence. Students must obtain the written consent of both their departmental advisor and the dean before credit earned at other institutions will be added to their records.13Revalidation Normally, a course may not be counted toward degree require - ments if it has been completed more than (a) five years prior to the awarding of the degree for master's students or, (b) seven years prior to the passing of the qualifying examination for Ph.D. students. The graduate advisor, after consultation with the advisory committee, may, however, recommend to the dean that course work taken prior to the above deadlines be revalidated if it can be demonstrated that the knowledge con - tained in the course(s) remains current. Currency of knowledge may be demonstrated by such things as: (a) passing an exami - nation specifically on the material covered by the course2; (b) passing a more advanced course in the same subject area; (c) passing a comprehensive examination in which the student demonstrates substantial knowledge of the content of the course; (d) teaching a comparable course; or (e) publishing scholarly research demonstrating substantial knowledge of the content and fundamental principles of the course. Each course for which consideration for revalidation is being requested should be justified separately. Grades Grade points are assigned at Indiana University according to the following scale, and grade point averages are computed taking into account any plus or minus accompanying a letter grade. A = 4.0 A- = 3.7 B+ = 3.3 B = 3.0 B- = 2.7 C+ = 2.3 C = 2.0 C- = 1.7 D+ = 1.3 D = 1.0 D- = 0.7 F = 0 Ordinarily a minimum of a B (3.0) average in graduate work is required for continuance in graduate study, and for all graduate degrees. Courses completed with grades below C (2.0) are not counted toward degree requirements, but such grades will be counted in calculating a student's grade point average. Some departments may require an average grade in graduate courses higher than 3.0, while others may count no courses completed with grades below 3.0 toward degree requirements (see de - partmental entries). No work may be transferred from another institution unless the grade is a B (3.0) or higher. The dean may review a grade record at any time and may place a student on academic probation if the record justifies such action. When the grade point average of a student falls below 3.0 or the student is not making sufficient progress toward the degree, the dean will notify the student that he or she has been placed on probation. Unless the student brings this record up to a 3.0 grade point average or begins making satisfactory progress in the next semester of enrollment, the student will not ordinarily be allowed to continue in the University Gradu - ate School. Pass/Fail Option Students in good standing (i.e., with a grade point average of 3.0 or better) who have completed graduate course work suf - ficient for a master's degree may, with the written consent of their graduate advisor or of their advisory committee, enroll in courses outside their major and minor areas on a pass/fail basis under conditions stated in a memorandum available from the University Graduate School office. Such courses may not be used to fulfill departmental language or research-skill require - ments. Enrollment under this option will be made at the begin - ning of the semester and may not be changed after the date fixed for dropping and adding of courses. Incomplete Grades The grade of Incomplete may be given only when the com - pleted portion of a student's work is of passing quality. It is the responsibility of the student who has incurred the grade of Incomplete in any course to satisfy the requirements of that course within one calendar year from the date on which the Incomplete is recorded. The student is expected to finish all necessary work in time for the instructor to assign a regular grade before the expiration of this time period. If the student is unable to do so because of circumstances clearly beyond the student's control, it is the student's responsibility to notify the instructor of the course, the graduate advisor, and the dean within the year of such circumstances and to request an extension of time. According to university policy, every overdue Incomplete will be changed to F after one calendar year. Both the student and the instructor shall be notified of this change in grade. This change will be made unless the dean has re - ceived notice of a regular grade duly assigned before that time or has approved a request for an extension of time. A change of the grade F will be considered only if the request for change is accompanied by an explanation of the circumstances involved. Students may not register in a course in which they have a grade of Incomplete. These regulations do not apply to research and reading courses in which completion of the course work is not usually required at the end of the semester. Such courses are indicated in de - partmental listings by the sign \"*\"; incomplete work in those courses will be denoted by R (deferred grade). Withdrawal from Course Work Withdrawals prior to the \"last day to drop a course with an automatic W\" (see official calendar for each semester) are automatically marked W. According to university regulations, withdrawal after this date is permitted only with the approval of the dean of the student's school for urgent reasons related to the student's health or equivalent distress. In all such cases, the student must submit a request for late withdrawal to the 14advisor or to the departmental chairperson. This request must be supported by the instructor of the course, the graduate ad - visor, and the departmental chairperson and then be forward - ed to the dean with an accompanying statement outlining the reasons for the request. If the dean approves the request, the student's mark in the course shall be W if the work completed up to the point of withdrawal is passing; otherwise a grade of F shall be recorded. Failure to complete a course without an authorized withdrawal will result in the grade of F. Addition of Course Work A student who wishes to enroll for additional course work after the first two weeks of a regular semester or after the first week of a summer session may do so if the instructor of the course, the graduate advisor, and the departmental chairperson recom - mend to the dean that this be done, and if the dean approves such a recommendation. Foreign Languages and Research Skills Individual departments determine whether foreign languages or research skills or both will be required. Where such require - ments exist, students must select the specific language(s) or research skill(s) from those approved by the major department and listed in its statement of departmental requirements. An - other language demonstrably useful in the student's research program may be substituted upon special recommendation of the major department and approval by the dean. A student whose native language is not English may, with the permission of the major department, either (1) demonstrate the required proficiency in that native language, or (2) use English to meet foreign language requirements. Proficiency in English may be demonstrated by taking the Test of English as a Foreign Lan - guage (TOEFL) examination. (For further information regarding the TOEFL examination, see the section International Students.) Reading proficiency in a foreign language is normally estab - lished in one of three ways: 1. By achieving an appropriate score on an examination ad - ministered on the Bloomington campus by the respective language department. Students should contact the lan - guage department for details. 2. By completing, with a grade of B (3.0) or better, the read - ing course _492 (e.g., F492 for French, G492 for German). Students may register for the first course in the sequence, _491, to prepare for _492; those who feel they have suffi - cient preparation may register for _492, though they should consult the language advisor first. 3. By receiving, in the cases of Catalan, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, or Spanish, a grade of B (3.0) or better in a literature or civilization course at Indiana University numbered 300 or higher (exclusive of individual readings and correspondence courses) in which the reading is done in the foreign language.3 For details, consult the respective language departments. In certain departments, reading proficiency may be demon - strated by presenting an original translation for approval by a faculty examiner designated by the appropriate language department. Proficiency in Depth In certain departments, students have the option of substitut - ing proficiency in depth in one language for reading proficiency in two languages. Proficiency in depth in a language is defined as the ability to read rapidly without the aid of a dictionary and the ability to speak, understand, and write in a manner comparable to that expected of students who have successfully completed fourth-year composition and conversation courses. For information about demonstrating proficiency in depth, students should consult the graduate examiner in the foreign language department concerned. Courses taken to fulfill research-skill requirements may, at the discretion of the student's major department, be counted for graduate credit in a student's program of study provided such courses are listed in this bulletin as carrying graduate credit. Each course must be passed with a grade of B (3.0) or higher to satisfy the proficiency requirement. Area Certificates Certificate programs are available in a number of areas; for further information, students should see the departmental entries in this bulletin. Such certificates can be pursued only in conjunction with a degree program and cannot be awarded independently. Free-Standing Certificates Graduate certificates are offered in some fields to allow a focused credential to be earned by a person who has already earned an undergraduate degree and is not enrolled in a master's or doctoral program. The courses taken are typically the same as those taken for other degrees, but a more limited number of courses is required for the certificate. Graduate certificates typically involve a predetermined curriculum of 16 to 20 credit hours. Students enrolled in free-standing certificate programs who wish subsequently to pursue an advanced de - gree must make separate application to the University Gradu - ate School and must have specific permission of the faculty of their degree program to use any credits earned as a certificate student for the more advanced degree. 1 The member institutions of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) are the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Cham - paign, Indiana University, the University of Iowa, the Univer - sity of Michigan, Michigan State University, the University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, The Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, Purdue University, the Univer - sity of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee 2 If the qualifying examination is used for this purpose, the number of courses to be revalidated by this method should be limited to two in order to avoid compromising the integrity of 15the qualifying examination process. 3 Courses in Russian offered to meet this requirement must be approved by the Department of Slavic Languages and Litera - tures. 16University Graduate School 2009-2010 Academic Bulletin General Requirements for Advanced Degrees University Graduate School Kirkwood Hall 111 Indiana University Bloomington, IN 47405 (812) 855-8853 Contact: grdschl@indiana.edu Graduate Office Union Building 207 Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Indianapolis, IN 46202 (317) 274-1577 Contact: gradoff@iupui.edu Guidelines for Requirements The following statements regarding degree requirements outline the minima that are acceptable. The student must meet not only the general requirements of the University Gradu - ate School but also the specific requirements of the individual department(s). Requirements are given in this bulletin only for degrees awarded by the University Graduate School. Profes - sional graduate degrees are also available at Indiana University (such as the Master of Business Administration, Master of Science in Education, and Doctor of Music degrees). These pro - fessional degrees are administered by the respective schools; information regarding these degrees and the requirements for each may be found in the bulletins of the individual schools. The University Graduate School recommends that those who intend to continue graduate work toward the Ph.D. degree elect one of the traditional master's degree programs requiring a thesis or a foreign language or both. Academic Integrity Students are expected to adhere to the highest ethical stan - dards in all their course work and research. Individuals violating that code of conduct are subject to disciplinary action; such breaches could lead to expulsion of the student from Indi - ana University or to recision of a degree already granted. To acquaint students more fully with the range of issues relating to academic integrity, the University Graduate School has pre - pared a document entitled Integrity in Graduate Study, which deals with plagiarism, fraud, and conflicts of interest, among other topics. Copies of that document may be obtained from departmental offices, from the office of the University Gradu - ate School, in Kirkwood Hall 111 (IUB), or from the Graduate Office in the Union Building, Room 207 (IUPUI). Every student should be familiar with its contents. Requirements for Master's Degrees About the Requirements for Master's Degrees The number of credit hours required by the University Gradu - ate School for master's degrees varies according to the individ - ual degree (see below for details). However, with the exception of the Dual Master's Program, the requirements for all master's degrees must be completed within five consecutive years. With the exception of the Master of Arts for Teachers (M.A.T.), a thesis or reading knowledge of a foreign language is normally required for a master's degree (see departmental entries for exceptions). If a thesis is not required, departments are encour - aged to substitute some other type of special project that is creative, exploratory, or experimental in nature. In lieu of the traditional thesis, for example, the department might require seminar papers, presentations, publishable reports, artistic performances, or exhibitions. The thesis or alternative project should be equivalent to no fewer than 3 nor more than 9 hours of graduate credit; such credit should be granted under an ap - propriate departmental course or independent study number. Departures from traditional thesis requirements prescribed by the individual departments must be approved by both the department and the dean. If a thesis is submitted, the student must file the original and one copy (both bound) with the Uni - versity Graduate School. These copies will later be placed in the University Library. At least one additional bound copy must be filed with the major department. The title page must bear the statement: \"Submitted to the faculty of the University Graduate School in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree Master of ______ in the Department1 of ______________ , Indiana University.\" At least three members of the faculty shall normally participate in the approval of the thesis and must sign an acceptance page which appears after the title page. The statement, \"Accepted by the faculty of the University Graduate School, Indiana University, in partial fulfillment of the require - ments for the degree Master of ___________ ,\" should precede the signatures on the acceptance page. Each copy of the thesis is to be accompanied by the student's vita sheet inserted at the end. For details regarding the typing and duplication of theses, see Preparation of Theses and Dissertations. Three or more faculty members should participate in certifica - tion of the student's fulfillment of the requirements for a mas - ter's degree. Their participation may take any of several forms, such as administering a final or comprehensive examination, or evaluating the candidate's thesis or alternative project. In in - stances where shortcomings are apparent, the student may be required to complete additional course work or assignments. 17If the master's degree is used to meet part of the requirements to convert a provisional or standard teaching certificate into a professional certificate (which is no longer a life license), the student's degree program must include at least 18 credit hours of graduate work in the major or minor field or both. Master of Arts Thirty (30) credit hours are required for the M.A., all of which may be taken in a single department; at least 20 of these credit hours must be earned in the major field. A minimum of 9 credit hours of course work or at least three courses in the major field (excluding thesis) must be numbered 500 or above. Master of Science General requirements for the M.S. are identical with those for the M.A. (see above).2 Master of Fine Arts The M.F.A. degree, which is offered in the Departments of English, Fine Arts, and Theatre and Drama, requires a minimum of 60 credit hours. Master of Arts for Teachers In order to be admitted to this program, students must hold a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution. The degree should include sufficient hours in each discipline in which students plan to work to enable them to elect courses carrying graduate credit (see departmental entries for details). Thirty-six (36) credit hours beyond the baccalaureate degree are required, at least 20 of which must be in the major teaching field, with the remainder allocated either to additional work in the major or to one or more minors. Certain interdepart - mental programs have specific minor requirements (for details, see the individual program statements). Each candidate must possess a teacher's certificate (from Indiana or another state in the United States) at the time the degree is conferred, with the exception of international students, who must be certified by their departments. Because in some cases licensing require - ments and M.A.T. course requirements may overlap, the teach - ing certificate will be issued and the degree will be conferred at the same time. Graduates who do not hold certificates (teach - ing licenses) should have their credentials evaluated for teach - ing certification purposes by the graduate licensing advisor in the School of Education. Upon recommendation of the department and approval by the dean, a maximum of 6 credit hours of undergraduate courses taken after completion of the baccalaureate degree may be ap - plied toward the M.A.T. degree. M.A.T. degrees are available in most areas represented in the high school curriculum. Interested students should consult the chairperson of the department or the division concerned to discuss programs of study. Dual Master's Program Students who are concurrently enrolled in two departments may qualify for two master's degrees under a provision that allows credit earned to satisfy the major requirements of one department to count as elective credit in a second department. Dual master's degrees require a minimum of 50 credits, with at least 21 credits earned in each of the programs. To be eligible for this program, a student must be formally admitted by both departments and by the University Graduate School. All re - quirements of both degrees must be met, including passing any departmental examinations and satisfying foreign-language/re - search-skill requirements. If both departments require a thesis, the student may write a single thesis that meets the require - ments of both fields. The thesis committee will comprise an equal number of representatives of both departments, and the thesis credit will be split between the two. All course work for the program must be completed within a period of six years. Preparation of Theses and Dissertations Theses and dissertations must be typed or laser-printed. The body of the text must be one-and-a-half- or double-spaced; margins must be at least one-and-a-half inches on the left and one inch on the top, right, and bottom. Page numbers must be consecutive throughout, with Arabic numerals used for the body of the work and small or lowercase Roman numerals for the front matter. Script fonts (ex. Monotype Corsica) and itali - cizing large sections of text are not allowed for the main body of your text, although italics may be used appropriately. The paper must be watermarked, 100-percent cotton bond paper of 20 or 24 lbs., in the format of 8 1/2 by 11 inch sheets. If photographs or detailed graphics are part of the work, make certain they are crisp and clear when printed. It is acceptable to use special laser or photo paper for the pages(s) in the disser - tation containing images in order to achieve the best possible quality. Theses and dissertations must be written in English unless you and your department/committee have decided otherwise. For more information, see the University Graduate School's online guide Preparing Theses and Dissertations , www.graduate.indi - ana.edu/preparing-theses-and-dissertations.php . Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy The Ph.D. degree requires completion of at least 90 credit hours of an advanced course of study. The degree is awarded in recognition of a candidate's command of a broad field of knowledge and accomplishment in that field through an origi - nal contribution of meaningful knowledge and ideas. Major Subject The student will select a major subject from the departments and programs listed in this bulletin. The major department or program is responsible for monitoring the student's progress 18toward the degree and for making recommendations to the University Graduate School regarding the nomination to candi - dacy, the appointment of a research committee, the defense of the dissertation, and the conferring of the degree. Minor Subjects The student will select at least one minor subject. A minor pro - vides additional breadth and depth to the individual's program. It must be taken outside the major department from among those areas of study listed in this bulletin or in a specifically approved inter- or intradepartmental area (see departmental entries).3 The determination of the minimum requirements and examination procedure (if any) for the minor is entirely at the discretion of the minor department or program. In certain cases, special interdepartmental minors (12 or more credit hours of work in two or more departments) or minors not specifically listed in this bulletin may be approved by the dean upon recommendation of the student's advisory com - mittee, provided such approval is requested prior to pursuit of any of the proposed courses of study. Examination procedures (if any) or other requirements (for example, stipulation of the minimum grades acceptable) should also be specified in the proposal to the dean. Double Major Students may pursue two majors in two departments simulta - neously, if so recommended by each department and approved by the dean. Two general requirements pertain to double ma - jors: (1) there must be a substantive relationship between the two major fields, particularly with respect to the topic of the student's dissertation; and (2) all degree requirements for each major must be fulfilled, including the passing of two sets of qualifying examinations. In some instances it may be possible to count the same work toward requirements in both depart - ments (e.g., a specific foreign language acceptable in both pro - grams). The exact courses of study and examinations required are to be determined by members of the research committee from each of the majors. Any area of substantial overlap in the two courses of study or in the examinations is to be negotiated by the committee as a whole and approved by the dean. There must be at least four faculty members on both the advisory and research committees for a double major, with two from each of the majors. If other minor fields are involved, a representative must also be present from each of these. A total of 90 credit hours is required for the Ph.D. degree with a double major. While judicious program planning may permit completion of some double majors within the 90 credit hours, other students may accrue additional hours due to the pro - grams of study required for each major. In recognition of such a possibility, students in the program will be allowed one addi - tional year before they must take the qualifying examinations. For a complete set of rules relating to double majors, students should consult the University Graduate School office. Combined Degree Program The School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, the School of Law, and the University Graduate School offer selected students an opportunity to pursue the M.S. or Ph.D. degrees, concurrently or sequentially, with a coordinated and flexible program leading also to the M.D., D.D.S., or J.D. degree. Com - bined degree programs are available in anatomy, biochemistry, dental science, medical biophysics, medical genetics, medi - cal neurobiology, microbiology and immunology, pathology, pharmacology, physiology, and toxicology. At Bloomington, the combined degree is available not only in these basic medical, biological, and physical sciences but also in the humanities and social studies. The combined degree program is designed to meet the student's particular objectives and needs and is planned by the student and an advisory committee of faculty representing the School of Medicine or the School of Dentistry and the respective department or program. Entry into a combined degree program requires approval of the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, the School of Law, and the University Graduate School. Two applications are necessary: one to the Indiana University School of Medicine, of Dentistry, or of law, and another to the Indiana University Graduate School via the sponsoring department or program. Indiana University School of Medicine has established an Indiana Medical Scientist Program for fellowship and tuition support of students in the combined M.D./Ph.D. program. A faculty committee nominates students for the program based on commitment to a career as a physician scientist, research experience, undergraduate grade point average, and MCAT scores. A flexible entry program allows students up to one year to identify a research laboratory and degree program. Informa - tion can be obtained from the Graduate Division of the School of Medicine. Completion of the program entails meeting all requirements for both degrees. Many nonclinical courses of the curriculum of the School of Medicine satisfy course requirements for both degrees, and credit given for graduate study may fulfill some of the School of Medicine requirements. The combined degrees may thus be acquired in less time than would be required if both were taken separately. As well as fulfilling requirements for the M.D. program, a minimum of 30 credit hours of graduate study is required for the combined M.S./M.D. degree. Of these, 10 credit hours may be transferred from exclusively School of Medicine courses with the approval of the student's advisory committee and the University Graduate School. Similarly, a minimum of 90 credit hours of graduate study is required for the combined Ph.D./M.D. degree. A maximum of 30 credit hours of exclu - sively School of Medicine courses may count toward the Ph.D. degree. On the Bloomington campus there is a combined M.A. in Telecommunications and J.D. in Law; see the entry in Telecom - munications for details. 19Within the University Graduate School, combined degrees are available in American Studies and Cognitive Science. Students in these programs must be accepted both by a Ph.D.-granting department and by either the American Studies or the Cogni - tive Science Program, and must satisfy the requirements for both chosen fields. Requirements are the same as those for the Ph.D. degree with a double major (see above). Advisory Committee The student's major department or program shall assign the student to an advisory committee no later than one year after admission to the Ph.D. program. The advisory committee must include at least two members from the major area and one from another. At least two members of the advisory committee must be members of the graduate faculty. The names of faculty members nominated to serve on the advisory committee shall be forwarded to the student's school or college for approval no later than one year after the student has been admitted to the Ph.D. program. The advisory committee shall approve the student's program of study and counsel the student until the passing of the qualifying examination. Qualifying Examination This examination, given at such time and in such manner as the major department shall determine, shall be written, although additional oral examinations may be required. The qualifying examination shall cover the major subjects and may, at the discretion of the minor department(s) or the interdepartmental committee, cover the minor subjects as well. Normally, the qualifying examination is taken after the student has completed all course work for the Ph.D. All such work of - fered in partial fulfillment of degree requirements must either have been completed within seven consecutive calendar years of the passing of the qualifying examination or be revalidated according to procedures outlined in this bulletin (see Revalida - tion).4 Reading proficiency required in one or more foreign lan - guages must also have been demonstrated, whether by course work or examination, no more than seven years before the passing of the qualifying examination. In the case of an exami - nation of more than one part, the date of passing is regarded as the date of passing the final portion of the examination, typically the oral examination. Students who fail the qualifying examination are normally allowed to retake it only once. The qualifying examination must be passed at least eight months before the date the degree is awarded. Admission to Candidacy Following the passing of the qualifying examination and the completion of all course work and departmental language or research-skill requirements (if any), the student's advisory committee will submit a Nomination to Candidacy Form to the University Graduate School. Upon approval of the dean, the student will be admitted to candidacy and awarded a Certifi - cate of Candidacy. The date of successful completion of the qualifying examinations (not the date of final approval of candi -dacy) is the one used in determining the seven-year periods for currency of courses (see Qualifying Examination) and comple - tion of the dissertation (see Submission of the Dissertation). Continuing Enrollment Students who have passed the qualifying examination must enroll each semester (excluding summer sessions) for any remaining required course work or dissertation credits. Once such students have accumulated 90 credit hours in completed course work and deferred dissertation credits, they must enroll for a minimum of 1 hour of graduate credit each semester until the degree is completed. Failure to meet this requirement will automatically terminate the student's enrollment in the degree program. Students who have completed 90 credit hours and all requirements for the Ph.D. are eligible to enroll in G901 for a flat fee of $150 per semester. Enrollment in G901 is limited to a total of six semesters. (For students not on campus, enrollment may be completed by mail.) A candidate who will be graduated in June, July, or August of any year must enroll in a minimum of 1 hour of credit as de - scribed above in either the current or the immediately preced - ing summer session. Dissertation The culmination of the Ph.D. program is the writing of the dissertation, which is required of all doctoral students. The dissertation must be an original contribution to knowledge and of high scholarly merit. The candidate's research must reveal critical ability and powers of imagination and synthesis. The dis - sertation is written under the supervision of a research director and a research committee, as described below. Although work published by the student may be incorporated into the dis - sertation, a collection of unrelated published papers, alone, is not acceptable. There must be a logical connection between all components of the dissertation, and these must be integrated in a rational and coherent fashion. It is the responsibility of the student's research committee to determine the kind and amount of published materials which may be included in a dis - sertation. Research Committee To initiate research for the dissertation, the student chooses a professor who will agree to direct the dissertation. The de - partment shall then recommend to the dean for approval a research committee composed of the chosen director (who will also normally serve as chairperson of the committee), two or more additional faculty members from the major depart - ment, and a representative of each minor. The committee should be selected from the members of the graduate faculty who are best qualified to assist the student in conducting the research for the dissertation. In the event that the dissertation research does not involve the area(s) of the minor(s) whether outside or inside the department the major department may request, with the consent of the minor-field representative(s), the substitution of a representative or of representatives from 20some other field(s) more appropriate to the topic of the dis - sertation. The committee has the responsibility of supervising the research, reading the dissertation, and conducting the final examination. All chairpersons of research committees and directors of research must be members of the graduate faculty with the endorsement to direct doctoral dissertations. If, however, special expertise in an area is held by a member of the gradu - ate faculty who does not have the endorsement, the depart - mental chairperson may request that the dean approve such an individual as research committee chairperson or director of the dissertation research. All members of a research committee must be members of the graduate faculty. At least half of the members of the committee must be members of the graduate faculty with the endorse - ment to direct doctoral dissertations; others may be regular members. After consultation with and approval by the dissertation direc - tor and research committee, the student will submit to the University Graduate School a one- or two-page prospectus of the dissertation research. If the proposed research involves hu - man subjects, animals, biohazards, or radiation, approval from the appropriate university committee must also be obtained. The membership of the research committee and the disserta - tion prospectus must be approved by the University Graduate School at least six months before the defense of the disserta - tion. Defense of the Dissertation When the dissertation has been completed, the student should submit an unbound copy to each member of the research com - mittee as the initial step in scheduling the defense of the dis - sertation. All members of the research committee should read the dissertation in its entirety before attending the defense. At this stage both the student and the faculty members must extend certain courtesies to each other. It is the responsibility of the student to give faculty members sufficient time to read the dissertation without making unreasonable requests of them based upon University Graduate School time limitations, immediate job possibilities, contract renewal, or some other reason. Similarly, a faculty member should not keep a student's work for inordinate periods of time because of the press of other duties. Once a faculty member assumes membership on a research committee, it becomes another part of his or her teaching assignment, comparable to conducting regularly scheduled classes. After the committee members have read the dissertation, there should be direct communication (either in writing or orally) between the research committee chairperson and the other committee members about its readiness for defense. Readiness for defense, however, is not tantamount to acceptance of the dissertation; it means that the committee is ready to make a decision. The decision to hold a doctoral defense, moreover, is not entirely up to the research committee. If a student insists upon the right to a defense before the committee believes the dissertation is ready, that student does have the right to due process (i.e., to an oral defense) but exercises it at some risk. If the decision to proceed with the defense of the disserta - tion is made against the judgment of one or more members of the committee, or if one or more members of the committee disapprove of parts of or all of the dissertation, the commit - tee member(s) should not resign from the committee in order to avoid frustration or collegial confrontation. The University Graduate School urges that such committee members, after ample communication with both the student and the chairper - son, remain on the committee and thus prevent the nomina - tion of a committee that might eventually accept what could be unsatisfactory work. Such a committee member could agree that a dissertation is ready for defense but should not be passed (or should not be passed without substantial modifica - tion). There will, of course, be situations in which the member - ship of research committees should or must be changed (e.g., turnover of faculty), but changes because of modifications in the dissertation topic or some equally plausible reason should be made early in the writing of the dissertation. Thirty days prior to the scheduled defense of the dissertation, the candidate must submit to the University Graduate School a one-page announcement of the final examination. This an - nouncement must follow a format available in the University Graduate School Preparing Dissertations and Theses . The announcement contains, among other things, a summary of the dissertation (not less than 150 words) which is informa - tive and contains a brief statement of the principal results and conclusions. The announcement must bear the signature of the research committee chairperson. If the candidate has published any scholarly articles relevant to the topic of the dissertation, bibliographical references should be included in the summary. A copy of such announcements will be sent to any member of the graduate faculty upon request. Once the final examination has been scheduled, the announced time and place of the defense must not be changed without the approval of the dean. Any member of the graduate faculty who wishes to attend the final examination is encouraged to do so; it is requested, however, that the faculty member notify the chairperson of the research committee in advance so that space can be arranged. With the approval of the research committee and the consent of the candidate, other graduate students may attend the defense of the dissertation; normally such students will act as observers, not as participants. At the end of the oral examination, the research committee must vote on the outcome of the examination. Four options are available to the committee: (1) pass, (2) conditional pass, (3) deferred decision, and (4) failure. If the decision to pass is unanimous, the dissertation is approved once it is received by the University Graduate School along with an acceptance page signed by the members of the research committee. If the decision is not unanimous, majority and minority reports should be submitted to the dean who, within 10 working days, will investigate and consult with the research committee. Upon completion of the dean's investigation and consultation, another meeting of the research committee will be held, and if 21a majority votes to pass, the dissertation is approved when it is received by the University Graduate School with an acceptance page signed by a majority of the members of the research com - mittee. The student must have received acceptance of his or her dis - sertation and must submit a copy to the University Graduate School within seven years after passing the qualifying examina - tion. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the termina - tion of candidacy and of the student's enrollment in the degree program. Any student whose candidacy lapses will be required to apply to the University Graduate School for reinstatement before further work toward the degree may be done formally. To be reinstated to candidacy in the University Graduate School, the student must: (1) obtain the permission of the departmental chairperson; (2) fulfill the departmental require - ments in effect at the time of the application for reinstatement; (3) pass the current Ph.D. qualifying examination or its equiva - lent (defined in advance)5; and (4) request reinstatement to candidacy from the dean. Such reinstatement, if granted, will be valid for a period of three years, during which time the can - didate must enroll each semester for a minimum of one credit. Submission of the Dissertation Following acceptance by the research committee, the dis - sertation is submitted to the University Graduate School. For complete guideline information, see the University Graduate School's online Preparing Theses and Dissertations (a printable version is also available online)\u2014 www.graduate.indiana.edu/ preparing-theses-and-dissertations.php . Each dissertation must include a title page bearing the state - ment: \"Submitted to the faculty of the University Graduate School in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy in the Department of ___________, Indiana University.\" The date of this page should be the month and year when all requirements have been satisfied; this is not necessarily the month in which you defend. Following the title page is the acceptance page with the statement: \"Accepted by the faculty of the University Graduate School, Indiana Univer - sity, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy.\" The acceptance page must be signed by members of the research committee. See the online guide for the complete order for the front matter. The candidate must also submit an abstract of no more than 350 words for the dissertation that has been approved and signed by the research committee. The abstract will appear in Dissertation Abstracts International published by University Mi - crofilms, Ann Arbor, Michigan. If the original abstract is not in English and an English translation has been made, submit both the English and non-English language abstracts. Copyright may be secured; contact the University Graduate School for details. The cost for copyrighting is currently $65 (for 2009-2010).Many Indiana University departments now allow electronic submission of the dissertation. Contact the department for more information. Traditional Submission: Once approved and finalized, one unbound copy of the dissertation, in a box suitable for mailing, and one or two bound copies must be filed with the University Graduate School. One of the bound copies is sent to the library and one bound copy is sent to the department, depending on departmental policy. The unbound copy of the dissertation will be microfilmed and will be available for purchase from PQIL (ProQuest Information and Learning Company) by all those who request it. The required fee for publishing the abstract and for microfilming the dissertation is currently $65 (for 2009-2010). Electronic Submission: Once approved and finalized, the dis - sertation should be submitted electronically in the form of a .pdf file to ProQuest. The dissertation will be transferred to the library and several dissertation databases by ProQuest. A microfilm version will also be made available for purchase from PQIL (ProQuest Information and Learning Company) by all those who request it. The required fee for publishing the abstract and for microfilming the dissertation is currently $65 (for 2009-2010). 1 Students majoring in programs will use the word \"Program\"; students majoring in departments outside of the College of Arts and Sciences will use the word \"School.\" 2 M.S. students in computer science are currently exempted from the regulation requiring that 9 credit hours of course work or three courses in the major field (exclusive of thesis) be numbered 500 or above. Students in the combined M.S./M.D. program have seven years in which to complete requirements for the M.S. degree; students in the M.S. program in geology at Indianapolis have six years in which to complete the require - ment. 3 As an exception to this rule, Indiana University doctoral stu - dents may take a minor in Purdue University graduate degree programs at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). 4 For students in combined M.D./Ph.D. programs, all course work offered in partial fulfillment of degree requirements of the Ph.D. must have been completed within nine consecutive calendar years preceding the passing of the qualifying exami - nation; for students in Ph.D. programs in music, within 10 consecutive years. 5 A department must define in advance specifically what is meant if an \"equivalent\" examination is to be used, and that definition must be approved by the dean. 22University Graduate School 2009-2010 Academic Bulletin Student Financial Aid Fellowships A number of fellowships are available to students enrolled in the University Graduate School.

The department assumes the ongoing responsibility of creating materials and conducting seminal research that aids in the develop - ment and shaping of African American and African Diaspora Studies as a discipline. Master of Arts Degree The Department of African American and African Diaspora Studies at Indiana University is committed to being one of the world's leading multi- and interdisciplinary graduate studies programs focused on peoples of African descent in the United States in comparison to African-descent peoples in other glo - balized contexts. With an emphasis on diverse epistemologies, 29theories, methodologies, ethical considerations, and innovative teaching pedagogies, our goals are: 1. to offer students an intense program in the examination of African American issues as well as diasporic African descent issues in and outside the United States and their transna - tional continuities and discontinuities; 2. to encourage students to develop and/or fine-tune excel - lent and creative research skills, superb writing and oral communications skills, multidisciplinary and interdisciplin - ary analytical skills, technological competencies, innovative problem solving and problem creation skills, collaborative research skills, and intercultural competence skills; 3. to provide students with invaluable intellectual training by bridging curriculum content and practical experience gained from oral history, survey, and ethnographic field work; research based in museums and library archives; and internship opportunities in a broad spectrum of agencies, organizations, and institutions; 4. to sustain a learning environment in which students create as well as refine critical questions and develop problem creation as well as problem solving skills in the humanities and social sciences and synthesizing bridges between the humanities and social sciences in their explorations and interpretations of African descent experiences in the United States and abroad; 5. to give students planning to pursue doctoral training in the social sciences, humanities, or in interdisciplinary fields excellent research foundations; 6. to prepare students for a broad spectrum of career possi - bilities in academia, creative and performing arts, nonprofit management, public policy, libraries, philanthropy, muse - ums, urban studies, conflict resolution, and social services. The purposes of this program are: 1. to offer students an intense program in the analysis of Afri - can American issues; 2. to expose students to both historical and current method - ological approaches; 3. to expose students to issues throughout the African Diaspora; 4. to refine critical and problem-solving skills in both the hu - manities and social sciences; 5. to extend a sound basis for those going into a doctoral program; and 6. to prepare students for administrative, teaching, communi - cation, and social service careers. In sum, the program provides a theoretical base of knowledge, methods of research, and a context for analyzing African Ameri - can and Diaspora experiences that can be invaluable either in further graduate studies or in a specific job or career choice.

These shared experiences - among them, slavery, emancipation, imperialism, decolonization, and racism - warrant close attention, and mark this field (Black Studies/Africana Studies) as a discrete unit of study that bears directly and powerfully on world history, literature, and politics. The doctoral degree offers graduate students two different tracks or specializations to focus their course work - \"Power, Citizenship, and the State\" and \"Race, Representation, and Knowledge Systems\"- which reflect the current state of the field and take advantage of the traditional strengths of the de - partment, its adjunct faculty, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Bloomington campus. Within each of these tracks, the degree emphasizes the importance of transnational, global, and comparative perspectives, with an emphasis on the inter - disciplinary analysis of race in the world.

Elective courses are to be selected from the range of cross-list - ed African Studies offerings in the College of Arts and Sciences and several professional schools, with the approval of the student's major advisor. Electives may include three additional credits of AFRI-A731 since the topic for the African Studies Interdisciplinary Graduate Seminar changes every semester and is offered by different faculty members on a rotating basis. Language Requirement At least four semesters of an African language. Students may have the language requirement waived by demonstrating equivalent competence through an examination completed under supervision of the African Languages Coordinator. Up to three credits for the study of an African language beyond the second year level may count toward the electives. M.A. Committee and Thesis Students are required to constitute a committee composed of a disciplinary advisor and two additional members with relevant regional or topical expertise, approved by the direc - tor of the African Studies Program. Committee members must be selected from African Studies affiliate faculty with profes - sional experience on the African continent. The purpose of the committee is to provide consultation to the student as needed and to read/comment on the master's thesis. There is no M.A. examination option. The M.A. thesis should be an in-depth treatment of the chosen topic, interdisciplinary in nature and 70 to 100 double-spaced pages in length. It may be an expanded seminar paper or an entirely new project based on library, archival, field, or museum research, and should make use of relevant sources in a lan - guage other than English. All three committee members must approve the thesis but may agree to waive an oral defense. Dual M.A./M.L.S. in African Studies and Library Science The College of Arts and Sciences African Studies Program and the School of Library and Information Science jointly offer a three-year program that qualifies students for a dual master's degree (M.A./M.L.S.). The program responds to the growing need for librarians with Africa-specific knowledge and research experience in the humanities and social sciences. The dual M.A./M.L.S. program requires completion of a minimum of 56 credit hours of graduate coursework and the two degrees must be awarded simultaneously. Students will be assigned a mentor/advisor from each unit. The student's African Studies M.A. thesis committee should include a representative of the SLIS faculty or other means of including perspectives of both programs. Admission Requirements Same as for the College of Arts and Sciences Master of Arts in African Studies degree, except that students must also apply to the master's program of the School of Library and Information Science and meet its established admissions criteria. Students must be accepted by both units in order to be admitted to the program. African Studies Core Requirements A minimum twenty-six hours of coursework distributed as follows: AFRI-A731 African Studies Interdisciplinary Graduate Seminar (3 cr.) AFRI-A732 Bibliography of Sub-Saharan Africa (3 cr.) AFRI-A650 Interdisciplinary Research Methods (3 cr.) At least twelve credit hours of elective courses organized around a topi - cal or regional concentration AFRI-A651 Independent Research/Directed Readings (up to 6 cr.) toward the M.A. thesis Elective courses are to be selected from the range of cross-list - ed African Studies offerings in the College of Arts and Sciences and several professional schools, with the approval of the student's major advisor. Electives may include three additional credits of AFRI-A731, since the topic for the African Studies Interdisciplinary Gradu - ate Seminar changes every semester and is offered by different faculty members on a rotating basis.38Library and Information Science Course Requirements Thirty credit hours of coursework consisting of: 1. 15 credits of M.L.S. foundation courses, with S552 Aca - demic Library Management to fulfill the management and leadership skills requirement; 2. 3 credits of either S521 Information in the Humanities or S522 Social Science Information; and 3. 12 credits of elective courses chosen in consultation with the student's SLIS advisor. An intership related to African Studies is strongly advised. Language Requirement Same as for the M.A. in African Studies. See also: www.slis.indiana.edu/degrees/joint/africa.html Ph.D. Minor in African Studies The African Studies program offers the Ph.D. Minor to students in the following fields: anthropology, archaeology, comparative literature, economics, English, education, fine arts, folklore, French, geography, history, instructional systems technology, journalism, law, linguistics, political science, public and environ - mental affairs, sociology, and Spanish and Portuguese. Students selecting African studies as a minor should report to the program office (Woodburn Hall 221) as soon as possible after arriving on campus. The program director and staff will as - sist with orientation concerning courses, faculty, and students. Course Requirements Students minoring in African studies must complete AFRI-A732 Bibliography of Sub-Saharan Africa (to be taken, if possible, during the first year) and four other graduate-level courses in African studies outside their major field. The courses should be at least two different disciplines; must be taught by an African Studies Program affiliated faculty member; and must be ap - proved by the Program director. The African studies Interdisciplinary Seminar AFRI-A731 may be taken twice for a total of six credits but variable credit is only allowed in addition to having taken it once as a three-credit seminar. One language course in the third year of study, or higher, may be counted towarfd the Minor. The program strongly recommends that Ph.D. candidates who minor in African Studies take two years of an African language in addition to their course work for the minor. Serious scholars of Africa are proficient in at least one African language. More - over, language proficiency improves opportunities for fieldwork and funding; in fact it is a requirement for important overseas study grants (e.g., SSRC and Fulbright-Hays awards). Students preparing a minor in Afican Studies and a minor in another field may double-count only one course. Students with special qualifications or previous course work at leading institutions may petition the Graduate Affairs Com - mittee to give credit for work that is comparable to specific courses at Indiana Unviersity. Petitions must include a formal letter of request from the candidate, as well as a syllabus from the course in question. The materials should be submitted to the Chair of the Graduate Affiars Committee or the Director of the African Studies Program. The requirements statee above constitute a minimum level of expectation. Examination Although a 3.7 grade point average in African studies courses would normally exempt the student from having to take a written comprehensive examination, the decision in this mat - ter rests with the student's major-field advisor and the faculty member representing African studies as the minor-field advisor. Certifying that the student has met the minimum requirements rests with a faculty member in the African Studies Program who is not in the student's major department.

Degrees Offered Doctor of Philosophy, a combined degree program in American Studies and another discipline (including but not limited to: African American and African Diaspora Studies, anthropology, art history, communication and culture, comparative literature, criminal justice, education, English, folklore, gender studies, history, history of education, journalism, law, philosophy, politi - cal science, religious studies, sociology, Spanish, telecommuni - cations, theatre and drama). The American Studies Program provides an opportunity to pursue the interdisciplinary study of American society and culture. In the program, students acquire specialized training in one particular discipline as well as firm grounding in interdisci - plinary study. They are encouraged to shape portions of their graduate studies to fit individual needs and interests. Courses in the program are also open to graduate students pursuing a master's degree in another department, special nondegree graduate students, and international students. Special Program Requirements See also general University Graduate School requirements. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Admission Requirements Acceptance into the American Studies Program is contingent upon prior admission by the home department. Students should apply, indicating a desire to pursue the combined doctoral degree in their statement of purpose, which is to be submitted with the application. A copy of the statement of pur - pose and a letter indicating your interests should be sent to the American Studies Program Admissions Committee. Deficien - cies in background may be removed by completing specified courses. Course Requirements A minimum of 90 credit hours, of which 32 must be in Ameri - can Studies, 20 hours of core courses including G603 (4 cr.), G604 (4 cr.), G751 (3-4 cr.), and eight additional credit hours, such as G605 (4 cr.), G620 (3-4 cr.), cr.), or cross-listed and joint-listed courses taught by American Studies faculty members outside the student's home depart - ment. The 32 credit hours may include 12 credit hours of appropriate courses relevant to American Studies inside the student's home department. Strong encouragement is given to interdisciplinary diversification. The dissertation (minimum of 15 credit hours) should reflect interdisciplinary study and research. Advisory and Research Committees The Graduate School requires that students pursuing a com - bined Ph.D. have at least four faculty members on their advisory and research committees, with two from each of the major fields (see the General Requirements chapter in the Graduate Bulletin). While AMST-affiliated faculty in a student's home department can serve as representatives of American Studies, the program additionally requires that at least one of the AMST representatives on the committee be from outside of the student's home department. Qualifying Examination Students in the combined Ph.D. degree program must take a comprehensive written examination in the field of American Studies in addition to the qualifying examination given in the student's home department. The examination is to be taken after completion of the American Studies course requirements. The examination may be repeated only once. Final Examination The oral defense of the dissertation will be conducted jointly with the student's home department. At least two members of the American Studies faculty must be on the student's disserta - tion committee. Ph.D. Minor in American Studies Students choosing American Studies as a minor (minimum 12 credit hours) in their doctoral program must complete G603, G751, and either G604, G605, G620, G697, 4 credit hours in G753, or a cross-listed course outside their home department that has been approved by the program director. Ph.D. Minor in Native American and Indigenous Studies Students who pursue the Ph.D. minor in Native American and Indigenous Studies will focus their interdisciplinary study on the histories, cultures, and literatures of Native American and Indigenous peoples, chiefly in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, but also, where appropriate, in the broader Americas. This is one of a very few programs in the United States that focus explicitly on Native American and Indigenous Studies at the graduate level, and that place the study of American Indians within the context of a broader, more sweeping and 43international inquiry into the nature of political power, colonial settlement, and global contact. Program of Study Students are required to submit a \"Program of Study\" to an af - filiated American Studies faculty member for final approval. Af - ter approval, a signed copy should be sent to the Director. The Program of Study will provide the rationale for the student's proposed curriculum and will list the courses, with alternative selections in the event such courses are not offered on a timely basis that will serve as the student's minor program. With the Director's approval, the student will become officially enrolled in the Native American and Indigenous Studies degree. Requirements Requirements for the Native American and Indigenous Stud - ies Ph.D. minor encourage graduate students to develop a program of academic inquiry that complements their doctoral program and takes advantage of the wide range of College of Arts and Sciences faculty with a focus on Native American and Indigenous literature, politics, art, history, culture, and folklore. Students must complete at least 12 credits of coursework, in - cluding G605, \"Introduction to Native American and Indigenous Studies,\" which is required. The remaining credits can come from any other American Studies course offered by faculty outside of the student's home department, including G620, \"Colloquium in American Studies,\" with relevant Native or In - digenous content, and a section of G751, \"Seminar in American Studies,\" with relevant Native or Indigenous content, or G753, \"Independent Study in American Studies, also with relevant Na - tive or Indigenous content.

The program draws on the faculty of 12 departments: Anthropol - ogy, Central Eurasian Studies, Classical Studies, Comparative Literature, Fine Arts, Geological Sciences, History, History and Philosophy of Science, Jewish Studies, Musicology, Philosophy, and Religious Studies. The minor in Ancient Studies aims to help students expand the depth and scope of their knowledge of ancient cultures and learn about different approaches to them. To promote these ends, it permits students to draw on courses from two or more departments outside of their home department. A student might choose to group together courses from different departments that focus on a certain period (e.g., late antiquity) or topic (e.g., social history). Course Requirements Students must complete 12 graduate credit hours of appropri - ate courses outside their home department. These courses must be in at least two different departments. No more than 3 credit hours of directed readings can be applied to the minor. No more than 6 credit hours of language study may count toward the minor, all of which must be above the elementary level. The minor advisor (Edward Watts, ejwatts@indiana.edu) must approve the particular courses that are to be counted toward the minor. Grades Courses in which a student receives less than a B (3.0) will not count toward the minor. Courses Classical Studies C405 Comparative Mythology (4 cr.) C409 Roman Literature and Art (3 cr.)

Recommended undergraduate training in anthropol - ogy and related fields: for students interested primarily in the field of bioanthropology, courses in chemistry and the biologi - cal sciences; for students specializing in the field of archaeol - ogy, courses in history and earth sciences and the humanities; for students specializing in the subfield of social/cultural an - thropology, courses in the social sciences and the humanities; 53for students specializing in the field of linguistic anthropology, courses in general linguistics and psycholinguistics. Master of Arts Degree Requirements (1) A minimum of 30 credit hours, with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.25 and no more than 6 credit hours of thesis credit. At least 20 credit hours must be in anthropology, including three courses (excluding thesis) that are numbered 500 or above; (2) at least one course that carries graduate credit in three of the four fields listed above; (3) at least one semester or two summer sessions of full-time study while in residence on the Bloomington campus; and either (4) a thesis or (5) a four-hour written examination. Examination grading will be (a) pass with distinction, (b) pass (both of these include the award of the M.A. degree), or (c) failure. The examination may be taken twice, but two failures will result in automatic dismissal of the student. Option (4) or (5) must be selected; no change will be allowed once the selection is made. No oral ex - amination or defense of the thesis is required. The thesis must be read and approved by all members of the student's com - mittee. A master's thesis may be based on library, laboratory, or field research. The department does not require, but does recommend, the completion of one foreign language, particu - larly if the student contemplates continuing for the Ph.D. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Department of Anthropology offers all four fields of the discipline: archaeology, bioanthropology, linguistic anthropol - ogy, and social/cultural anthropology. Students elect one of these fields as a major, but may take courses and/or minor in any of the other fields. Students may also select one of three concentrations, Archaeology and Social Context, Food Studies, and Paleoanthropology. Each of these concentrations is supple - mental to the major/field. Each major/field involves its own breadth requirements within the Department of Anthropology and other that may require further class work. All four fields have the following requirements in common. Foreign Language/Research Skills One of three is required: (1) reading proficiency in two lan - guages, one normally selected from French, German, Russian, Spanish, or Portuguese (consult advisor for additional languag - es); (2) proficiency in depth in one language, normally selected from French, German, Russian, Spanish, or Portuguese; or (3) reading proficiency in one of the languages cited in (1) plus proficiency in computer science or statistics. Qualifying Examination In order to be recommended to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in anthropology, the student must pass a qualifying examina - tion. This examination cannot be administered until the foreign language or research skills and other requirements have been fulfilled and until at least 60 credit hours have been earned. Students are strongly encouraged to complete course work and take the qualifying examination in three years. The format of the exam shall be decided by the advisory committee in consul -tation with the student from among the following options: (1) a take-home exam, or (2) a proctored in-camera exam, or (3) an exam combining elements of (1) and (2). Preparation, adminis - tration, and grading of the examination are the responsibility of the advisory committee, but other members of the department are free to participate without voting. A passing grade requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the anthropologists on the examining committee. Grading is as follows: (a) pass with distinction; (b) pass [both (a) and (b) include certification to doctoral candidacy and the M.A. degree if desired and not already awarded]; (c) low pass with terminal M.A. degree; (d) failure. The qualifying examination may be retaken once. Research Proposal At least two weeks before the qualifying examination, the stu - dent will circulate his or her Research Proposal to the Advisory Committee. The Research Proposal must include a statement of the research problem, a literature review related to that prob - lem, the methodology to be employed, a tentative timetable of data collection and analysis, and (if a grant application has been or will be submitted) a discussion of funding prospects and the budget. All grant applications must be discussed with the student's Academic Advisor. Students are normally examined on aspects of their research proposal during their qualifying examination, both the written and oral portions. Nomination to candidacy and appointment of the Research Committee cannot take place until the Research Proposal has been accepted by the Advisory Committee. All proposals that include the use of living human subjects must receive advance clearance by the IUB Institutional Review Board (Human Subjects) regardless of whether external funding is sought. This clearance is required for use of informants, participant observation, interviews, and questionnaires, as well as more invasive research such as mea - surement and testing. Dissertation Each candidate must prepare a doctoral dissertation as part of the requirements for the Ph.D. degree. This dissertation may be the result of fieldwork or laboratory or library research. The department expects field research as part of the student's doctoral training in anthropology, but the dissertation may be based upon field data, laboratory data, museum collections, archives, or other documentary sources. The topic and general outline of the proposed dissertation must be approved by the candidate's research committee. Final Defense An oral examination of the dissertation\u2014which cannot be waived\u2014will be scheduled and administered by the candidate's research committee. Teaching The department considers teaching experience to be a critical part of graduate training. Therefore, every effort will be made to provide teaching opportunities for each graduate student.54Field or Major Requirements 1.

Mullins Degrees Offered Graduate Minor, Master of Arts in Applied Anthropology The M.A. in Applied Anthropology, IUPUI, was approved by the Higher Education Commission in September 2009. A descrip - tion of the degree program is available from the department. Graduate Minor The graduate minor in anthropology and health is an integrated field of 12 credit hours of study designed to supplement the graduate training of students with an interest in careers in the health field. The program has three goals: to provide students with a holistic perspective on the anthropology of health, which integrates human biology, ecology, and culture in a systems model of health; to develop students' anthropological inquiry skills in understanding health in human groups; and to develop students' abilities to apply anthropological concepts and skills to health interventions in the areas of their career focus. The graduate minor in anthropology and health will provide stu - dents with training that will add greater depth and breadth to their qualifications in their major field. They will be able to use the cross-cultural and biocultural perspectives of anthropology to supplement their primary graduate training to better pre - pare them for a career in the health fields. This focused training will enable students to use anthropological concepts and skills to identify biocultural factors in the occurrence of disease, to understand ethnic behavior related to illness, and to identify where health programs across social and ethnic lines can be made more effective.

Research Facilities Members of the Department of Astronomy use the WIYN (Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-National Optical Astronomy Observa - tories) 3.5m and 0.9m telescopes at Kitt Peak National Obser - vatory near Tucson, Arizona, to carry out research in optical astronomy. The advanced-technology 3.5m telescope delivers superb image quality over a wide field and is also optimized for multiobject spectroscopy, including a high-spectral-resolution mode and high-spatial-resolution imaging. Indiana University holds a 17 percent share of the WIYN facility. Two fully robotic telescopes are located in the Morgan-Monroe State Forest 16 miles from campus. These are a 0.4m telescope that is used for automated CCD photometry and a new 1.25m telescope to be used for automated spectroscopy. A remote observing center in the department is equipped for communication with both the WIYN and local telescopes. The High-Energy Astrophysics Group carries out research with underground, spacecraft, and balloon-borne detectors that are developed within the depart - ment. Several instrument development labs and machine shops support the optical and high-energy research programs. Research in the Department of Astronomy is supported by ex - cellent computational facilities. Students, faculty, and research staff have fast desktop machines with 1-Gbps network con - nectivity within the department and to the outside world. The department maintains several multi-Terabyte file servers and a number of high-performance computer platforms for simula - tions and data analysis. Indiana University operates BigRed, one of the fastest university-owned supercomputers in the world, as well as SMP clusters called Quarry and Libra. These com - putational research capabilities are supported by two massive data processing and storage systems: the Data Capacitor, which is a fast file system that can manipulate up to 0.5 Petabytes of data simultaneously, and the Massive Data Storage Service, which can permanently archive more than 4 Petabytes of data. Special Departmental Requirements (See also general University Graduate School requirements.)

An undergraduate major in astronomy, astrophysics, physics, or mathematics that 76has provided such a background is usually required for admis - sion. Any necessary undergraduate courses to strengthen students' backgrounds will not receive graduate credit. All graduate applicants must submit Graduate Record Examina - tion scores on both the General Test and the Subject Test in physics. Scores should be sent directly to the department, not to the University Graduate School. Master of Arts Degree Course Requirements A minimum of 30 credit hours, including any three astronomy graduate core courses (see below). Thesis A thesis may be required, at the discretion of the department. Students for whom the thesis requirement is waived must still complete a project that demonstrates research proficiency. Final Examination An oral examination must be passed covering general astrono - my at the A451-452 level, the core courses applied toward the degree, and the thesis research. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Course Requirements A total of 90 credit hours. Students are required to take six of the following core courses: A505, A520, A540, A550, A570, A575, and A580. Normally, these courses are offered at the rate of three courses per year, and they may be taken in any sequence. The remainder of the graduate program consists of elective courses, seminars on advanced topics, research, and dissertation. Grades Grades below B (3.0) in core courses may be counted toward degree requirements only at the discretion of the department. Minor Most doctoral candidates in astronomy minor in physics or scientific computing. Other minors may be permitted at the discretion of the department. Qualifying Examination In order to be advanced to candidacy, a student must pass a written examination covering the core course material plus general astronomy at the A451-452 level.

Depending on background and interest, students may concentrate on biblical texts and lan - guages, literary criticism, or the history and theory of interpre - tation. Study of ancient languages is strongly encouraged. Stu - dents with previous training in biblical studies will be advised to devote more time to courses in literary theory and Western literature; those with a stronger background in classical or modern literature will be advised to concentrate on the biblical text and its cultural setting. The institute offers a Ph.D. minor and a certificate that may be earned concurrently. Students participate in a regular seminar (I600) which, like most institute courses, combines close reading of specific texts with larger issues of methodology. Prospective students interested in pur - suing the M.A. or Ph.D. degree are urged to apply first to one of the affiliated departments, such as comparative literature (for literary theory) or religious studies (for biblical studies). Ph.D. Minor in Biblical Literature The Ph.D. minor in biblical literature is available to all doctoral students not specializing in biblical studies; four courses in biblical literature and in the history of biblical interpretation are required. Courses should be selected in consultation with the director of the institute. Grades Courses in which a student receives less than a B (3.0) will not count toward the minor. Graduate Certificate in Biblical and Literary Criticism The certificate is available to doctoral students in all depart - ments and to special students from outside Indiana University who wish to do advanced interdisciplinary work in biblical and literary studies. Course Requirements Eight courses in biblical literature, the history of biblical in - terpretation, and the theory and practice of literary criticism, including I600. The selection of courses should be made in consultation with the director of the institute. In certain cases, 81two of the eight courses may be in a biblical language. Courses that study biblical or exegetical sources in a national literature may also be counted. Language Requirement Proficiency in biblical Hebrew or Greek, to be certified by the completion of N472 or G308 or their equivalent, or by an ex - amination administered by the relevant language department. Grades Courses in which a student receives less than a B (3.0) will not count toward the certificate. Courses I600 Colloquium in Biblical and Literary Studies (4 cr.)

Six ad - ditional elective hours are required in either the major or minor field. Students may choose a major in one of the three tracks described below. In addition, students must complete a minor in a different track of biochemistry or in an outside program. The sequence of courses comprising the major must be ap - proved by the student's advisory committee. At the end of the first year, each student selects a research advisor and laboratory. Together with the advisor, the student also selects the other members of an advisory committee of three or four faculty members appropriate to the student's intended degree and one from the perspective minor field (see below). This advisory committee guides and monitors the stu - dent's subsequent independent work and guides the student's selection of advanced courses. The biochemistry graduate program requires that each student meet with the advisory committee at least once per year and that students present a research talk in the Biochemistry Research Club (BMB) during their second and subsequent years in the program. Major Requirements: Students may major in one of the following tracks: (1) Integrated Biochemistry The course requirements for this major are the core courses (B501, B502, B503, B504, B580). The minor must be completed in an area outside biochemistry. (2) Cellular and Medical Biochemistry The major consists of 12 credit hours chosen among the follow - ing courses:Biochemistry : B501 Integrated Biochemistry B502 Analysis of Acids B602 Advanced Protein Biosynthesis and B605 Function Membranes Virology Biology : L585 Molecular Genetics L586 Molecular Analysis of Cell Biology Medical Sciences: B801 Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry B802 Metabolism and Signal Transduction (3) Chemical and Structural Biology The major consists of 12 credit hours chosen among the follow - ing courses: Biochemistry: B503 Macromolecular Structure and Interactions Macromolecular Structure and Interactions B604 Structural Methods B605 Structure and Function of Membranes B680 Topics: Molecular Analysis of Cell Biology Chemistry : C540 Organic Reactions Mechanisms C612 Mass Spectrometry Minor The doctoral student in biochemistry may minor in any appro - priate discipline or in a track in Biochemistry not chosen for the major.

Grades Every student must maintain a minimum GPA of B+ (3.2) in or - der to remain in good standing. Courses to be counted toward the Ph.D. degree must be passed with a grade of B (3.0) or better. Preliminary Examination Students in all programs take a preliminary examination at the end of the fourth semester. Students who pass this examina - tion and complete the required course work are admitted to formal candidacy for the Ph.D. Satisfactory Progress Toward a Degree After passing the preliminary examination, for a student to remain in \"good standing\" in MBG requires that sufficient progress be made toward completing a thesis. If the research advisory committee judges progress to be unsatisfactory, probation may be recommended. At the end of the probation - ary period (usually a semester), probation will be lifted if the advisory committee judges the student's progress to be satis - factory. If the advisory committee judges the student's progress to remain unsatisfactory, then the student will be required to leave the program. Thesis The final requirement of each program is a Ph.D. thesis, which must be defended in a public research seminar and in a meet - ing of the research advisory committee. Advanced Courses and Minor The MBG, in conjunction with the degree program committees, offers a program of half-semester advanced courses (Z620). The selection of courses changes each year. Courses are offered in all the degree subjects. Each program requires that its students take at least two of these courses, at least one of which should be certified by the student's committee as appropriate to the chosen degree. Each student must select a minor field distinct from the chosen degree. Ordinarily a student will select as a minor one of the MBG degree programs not selected for the major. In those cases, the core program courses meet minor requirements. In some cases a student may select another minor and must meet any additional requirements set by that minor. 94For students from other programs who wish to minor in one of the MBG degree areas, the requirement is 6 credit hours of work in that field. The course selection should be approved by the director of MBG. Microbiology Degree programs are available for students with interests in many areas of microbiology. Each student's curriculum is designed by the student in consultation with the graduate pro - gram director, the student's mentor, and an appointed advisory committee. Master of Arts Degree with a Research Thesis Course Requirements A total of 30 credit hours; 12 of these must be course work not including M500, M800, or M850.

Dissertation (27 to 33 hours): The remaining hours to total 90 will be guided research dissertation hours. Qualifying Examination Students must pass an initial qualifying examination on the five core courses. The qualifying examination is a written exami - nation offered once a year during a two-day Qualifier Exam Session the week before classes start in August and is admin - istered in two sections - Theoretical Biostatistics and Applied Biostatistics. The preparation and the administration of the qualifying examination are overseen by the Graduate Exami - nation Committee. Students are expected to have completed and passed both sections of the qualifying examination on or before their qualifier deadline. Deadline for full-time students: The deadline for passing the qualifying examination for full- time students who enter the program with a master's degree or equivalent is August at the end of their second year; the deadline for full-time students who enter the program without a master's degree is August at the end of their third year. Deadline for part-time students: The deadline for passing the qualifying examination for part- time students who enter the program with a master's degree or equivalent is August at the end of their third year; the dead - line for part-time students who enter the program without a master's degree is August at the end of their fourth year. If students do not pass both sections of the examination by their qualifier deadline, they will have their privilege to con - tinue in the program terminated. A student will have at most two attempts to pass the examina - tion. The first attempt must include the entire examination, i.e. both the Theoretical and Applied sections. If one or both sections are not passed on the first attempt, then a second attempt on or before the deadline is allowed. During the final attempt, the student may only sit for the section(s) not passed in the first attempt. A student's first attempt at the qualifying examination will result in one of the following three outcomes: 1. Pass Both Sections: The student has demonstrated fundamental understanding of the core material and the examination committee believes he/she will be successful in completing the Ph.D. program. 2. Pass One Section: The student has demonstrated funda - mental understanding of one section, but lacks adequate understanding of the other section. The student must sit for the section not passed at a future examination session. 3. Fail: The student has failed to demonstrate an adequate understanding of the material from the core courses and thus fails the examination. The student must sit for both sections at a future examination session. A student's second and final attempt at the qualifying examina - tion will result in one of the following two outcomes: 1. Pass: The student has demonstrated fundamental under - standing of the core material and the examination com - mittee believes he/she will be successful in completing the Ph.D. program. 2. Fail: The student has failed to demonstrate an adequate understanding of the material from the core courses and thus fails the examination, with privilege to continue in the program terminated. Minor Area In addition to the 46 credit hours of formal statistics/biosta - tistics coursework, the student must complete a minor (9 - 15 credit hours) in an area related to any of the health and life sci - ences disciplines. The minor may be obtained in areas such as pharmacology and toxicology, epidemiology, genetics, biology, physiology, bioinformatics, public health and health economics, among many others, and it must be approved by the student's advisory committee. The minor must contain a minimum of three graduate level courses (nine credits) in the chosen area and it must comply with the minor requirements of the respec - tive department/unit. Preliminary Examination A student becomes eligible to take the preliminary examina - tion after passing the qualifying examination. The student must prepare and pass a preliminary examination, which consists of an oral presentation on an advanced research topic suggested by the student to an appointed committee of at least four fac - ulty members, including the student's advisor and at least one member from the student's minor area. The committee may consist of the same members as the student's original advisory committee, but is not required to. This committee will serve as the research committee for the student, and must be ap - proved by the dean. Prior to the examination, the student must provide the committee with a paper (10 - 15 pages) outlining the topic to be covered, clearly indicating the scope and depth of the planned research along with relevant references. In the examination, the student is expected to display an in-depth understanding of the chosen subject matter. The committee may ask the student questions which normally will be directed to the subject matter of the research but may, by natural exten - sion, also cover any other relevant topic. Admission to Candidacy Following the passing of the preliminary examination and the completion of all required coursework, the student's advisory committee will nominate the student to candidacy. Upon ap - proval of the dean of the The University Graduate School, the student will be admitted to candidacy. Final Examination Oral, primarily a defense of the dissertation. Normal Progress and Termination Once students begin research, they must maintain normal progress toward their degree objective to ensure continued 104financial support and/or active status. If, in the opinion of the research committee, satisfactory research progress is not being made or if the GPA continues to be below 3.0, a meeting of the student's research committee may be convened. This meeting will include a brief presentation by the student on the work accomplished up to that point, and/or a discussion concerning the problems which have hampered progress. If the consensus of the committee is that the student needs to show improve - ment, he/she will have 60 days to demonstrate a change in performance. At the end of this time, financial support may be discontinued, if applicable. If a student finds it necessary to withdraw from the graduate program, then he/she should provide as much notice as pos - sible. In the case of teaching or research assistants, students are expected to complete the semester once it has begun. Simi - larly, the program will provide a student with as much advance notice as possible if the student is dropped from the program for reasons of poor performance.

For details, see the Kelley School of Business Bulletin, Graduate Programs. Special School Requirements (See also general University Graduate School requirements.) Admission To apply for admission to the doctoral programs in business, the applicant must do the following: 1. For domestic and international applications: apply online at app.applyyourself.com/?id=IU-BLA . 2. Arrange for at least three letters of recommendation to be sent from persons qualified to judge the academic potential of the applicant. 3. Arrange to take (or have already taken within four years of the date of application) either the Graduate Manage - ment Admission Test or the Graduate Record Examination General Test. These tests are prepared by the Educational Testing Service and are administered at numerous locations throughout the United States approximately four times each year and, at less frequent intervals, in many foreign countries. 4. For domestic applications: submit official transcripts of all college work taken and other support material directly to the Chairperson of the Doctoral Programs, Kelley School of Business, 1309 E. Tenth Street, Indiana University, Bloom - ington, IN 47405-1701.1085. For international applications: submit official transcripts of all college work taken and other support material directly to the Office of International Admissions, 300 N. Jordan Avenue, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405. Detailed information on admission and financial aid as well as additional program data may be obtained from the doctoral programs office. The application deadline for August admis - sion is the preceding January 15 (December 1 for international students). Early applications are urged since all spaces in particular de - partments may be filled before the deadline. Late applications will be honored only if space is available. Admission to the doctoral program in business is based on an individual's qualifications as evidenced by the application, of - ficial transcripts, scores on the Graduate Management Admis - sion Test or the Graduate Record Examination, and, if possible, a personal interview. Prospective students' applications for admission and supporting credentials are reviewed by the doc - toral program's administrative committee and by the faculty in the proposed major department. While it is unusual, highly qualified students with career objec - tives clearly in mind may enter the doctoral programs in busi - ness directly from a baccalaureate program with the intention of working toward a doctoral degree. Most, however, will begin work toward the doctorate after obtaining the master's degree. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Program Requirements The requirements for the Ph.D. program in business are fulfilled in three basic phases of study. Although these phases may overlap, the program requires a logical sequence of course work, qualifying examinations, and dissertation research. Phase I The Phase I requirements entail no minimum number of credit hours but focus instead on proficiency in business operations and the basic disciplines. The credit hours required for profi - ciency may be met either by exemption (through the accep - tance of previous course work) or by taking courses or indepen - dent study after entering the program. Individual departments determine the appropriate requirements for their majors. Teaching Development Program All candidates for a doctoral degree in business must complete the 1.5 semester hour teaching development seminar or its equivalent. This seminar provides a grounding in learning and teaching styles and methods. Phase II The Phase II program of study is the central part of the stu - dent's doctoral-level course work. It is therefore critical that the courses be selected to achieve the student's educational objec - tives while emphasizing high levels of research and scholarship. Major Field The program of study for the major is planned in consultation with the student's major-field advisor and consists of a mini - mum of 18 credit hours of advanced graduate work. There is no intention that the entire program of study relating to the major must be taken in the administrative department or area represented by that major field. On the contrary, students are encouraged to incorporate courses from other departments or areas into their major-field curriculum when such courses are closely related to the individual's interests and help form a logical whole. Minor Field Each student selects one minor field, which requires a mini - mum of 9 credit hours of work beyond that expected as mini - mal preparation for all doctoral students. Minors are available in each of the major fields, as well as in the following fields (though not limited to these): international business, econom - ics, political science, history, mathematics, psychology, sociol - ogy, and law. The doctoral business minor provides the op - portunity for the integration of other disciplines into the major area(s) of students majoring in the Kelley School of Business; it requires a minimum of 9 credit hours from a field outside the student's major field. The minor requirements for fields outside the Kelley School of Business are determined by the depart - ment in which the minor is offered. An overall GPA of at least 3.4 in the three courses is required. Methodology and Analysis (M and A) Requirement All doctoral candidates must demonstrate competency in the areas of research methodology and statistical analysis. This is a 9 credit hour requirement. This course work will help provide the foundation and special proficiency in research design and analysis necessary for candidates to conduct their research programs. Double Major Option Rather than follow the major, minor, and M and A sequence, a doctoral student may elect to have two majors. The double major candidate has the option of (1) two majors, each with 18 credit hours, or (2) a first major with 21 credit hours plus a second major of at least 15 credit hours. There are two issues that a student electing a double major should consider. First, all double majors must pass the qualifying examination in both majors. Second, a double major is unlikely to be approved unless the student can demonstrate that a portion of the overall course work provides competency in M and A. Doctoral students may not unilaterally elect to have a double major; the student's petition for a double major must be approved by both departments as well as by the chairperson of doctoral programs. Grades Course grades below C+ (2.3) are not counted toward degree requirements but will be included in the computation of the student's grade point average. At least a 3.4 grade point aver -109age with no grade below B- (2.7) is required in those courses taken as part of the minor field. Students must achieve an overall grade point average of at least 3.3 and earn no less than a B- (2.7) in those courses taken as part of the methodology area. Examinations Evidence of the student's competence in a major field must be demonstrated by examination. Examinations may also be required in some minor fields. The examinations are designed as exercises in creative and critical thinking, not merely in recol - lecting facts and familiar analyses. Admission to Candidacy Upon successful completion of all Phase II requirements (including all qualifying examinations), the student will be nominated to candidacy. Dissertation Proposal Examination on the dissertation proposal usually comes at the close of the work in Phase II of the program. A research com - mittee is appointed to supervise and assist each candidate. A formal oral examination, to which other doctoral students and faculty members are invited, is held on the proposal. Upon passing the examination, the candidate moves into the third phase of the program. Phase III Dissertation An important early part of the dissertation experience is inte - grated with the advanced course work through the research seminars. A minimum of 24 credit hours of dissertation credit is required, but 3 hours of credit in research seminars within the major area may count toward this requirement. Since the dis - sertation represents a major research project, a year or more of full-time work in close cooperation with the candidate's committee is normally required to complete Phase III. For this reason, candidates in the Indiana University doctoral programs in business are strongly urged to remain in residence until all degree requirements have been met. Defense of the Dissertation Phase III concludes with the defense of the dissertation. The objective of the defense is to provide students with a forum for formal presentation of the results of their dissertation research. The purpose of the presentation, questioning, and discussion is to enable students to demonstrate that they have successfully completed what they set out to do, as stated at the time of the proposal defense. The dissertation defense gives the research committee a final opportunity to bring the candidate's research methods, findings, and conclusions under critical review. The candidate is expected to be able to defend all aspects of the inquiry satisfactorily. For further information on the Doctor of Philosophy degree in business, consult the doctoral programs website: http://www.kelley.iu.edu/doctoral/.Ph.D. Minor in Business Students in other departments may minor in business by completing 9 credit hours of graduate work at the 600 level or above. A specialized minor field may be selected from the major fields for business students; a nonspecialized minor consists of courses from different fields. In the Kelley School of Business, courses numbered 600 or above are doctoral semi - nars. Courses at the 500 level are M.B.A. courses. Permission is required from the M.B.A. program for non-M.B.A. students to enroll in these courses. Interested students should contact the doctoral programs office for further information about avail - able fields and procedures to be followed.110University Graduate School 2009-2010 Academic Bulletin Cellular and Integrative Physiology Graduate Office Union Building 207 Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Indianapolis, IN 46202 (317) 274-1577 Contact: gradoff@iupui.edu School of Medicine Indianapolis Chairperson Professor Michael Sturek Departmental E-mail cellphys@iupui.edu Departmental URL www.medicine.iu.edu/physiology Graduate Faculty (An asterisk [*] denotes membership in the University Graduate School faculty with the endorsement to direct doctoral disser - tations.)

Students pursuing a minor are encouraged to identify a faculty advisor in the department as early as possible so that a well-integrated program of study can be established. Research Language Requirement Requires one research language in addition to the research language required for the M.A. degree. Qualifying Examination Written and oral. The student will be examined in two fields with a separate faculty examiner for each field. The written portion of the qualifying examination will be two hours long for each of the two fields in which the student is to be examined. Prior to the exam, the student, in consultation with the faculty examin - ers, will prepare an examination reading list for each field. These reading lists must include works in both the language of specialization and the research languages. These reading lists will be kept on file with the examinations. Each of the faculty examiners will prepare three or four questions, of which the student will answer two, allowing approximately one hour for each question. Marks of \"high pass,\" \"pass,\" and \"failure\" will be assigned to each field in the written and oral examinations. Unsatisfac - tory performance in one field of the written examination will require repetition of the examination in that field before the orals may be taken. Failing marks received in two fields of the written examination will constitute failure in the written part, and the student will not be allowed to retake the written examination during the same semester. If the student fails the written examination twice, consent to continue work in the department will be withdrawn. Unsatisfactory performance in one field of the oral examination will require repetition of the examination in that field. Failing marks received in two fields of the oral examination will consti - tute failure in the oral part, and the student will not be allowed to retake the oral examination during the same semester. If the student fails the oral examination twice, permission to continue work in the department will be withdrawn. 116Dissertation Required. Final Examination Defense of dissertation.

By the time the degree is earned, the student should show promise of becoming a capable and independent investigator in chemistry. The major emphasis for the Ph.D. is on research while in residence on the Bloomington campus. Research should be the student's greatest challenge and the focus of the major portion of his or her energy. The 133student's attitude toward and progress in research is a most important factor in graduate committee decisions. Course Requirements A total of 90 credit hours, of which at least 24 credit hours must be in course work. Students may major in analytical, biological, inorganic, materials, organic, or physical chemistry. Doctoral students majoring in a field of chemistry are required to complete a minimum of 12 credit hours of course work in that field, following a sequence of courses approved by their advisory committee. A doctoral student in chemistry can choose to minor within the Chemistry department or can elect to minor in some other department. In the latter case, the requirements are specified by the minor department. Students electing to minor within the department must complete a minimum of 6 credit hours in areas of chemistry other than the major area. The course work comprising an inside minor must be approved by the advisory committee. All doctoral students in chemistry are required to enroll in C500 Introduction to Research during their first year of study. Foreign-Language/Tool-Skill Requirement The department has no formal foreign language or tool-skill requirement, but Ph.D. advisory committees may consider such courses essential for individual students. Qualifying Examinations To remain in good standing, each student must successfully complete the Chemistry seminar course in the chosen major (A800, B800, M800, N800, R800, or P800) during the third and fourth semester, and present a literature seminar by the end of the second year. In the fifth semester, students meet with their advisory committees to review past performance in both the major and minor areas and to evaluate plans for complet - ing the Ph.D. This review includes a seminar, written document, and oral examination. Current information concerning proba - tion, termination, and reinstatement policies may be obtained from the departmental graduate office. Final Examination Usually oral, covering dissertation, major, and minors, and also a seminar describing the dissertation. Ph.D. Minor in Chemistry Students from other departments who wish to minor in chem - istry must complete at least 6 credit hours of graduate course work in chemistry with an average of B (3.0) or above.

Placement Examination All newly admitted students will be required to take a trans - lation examination in Latin and/or Greek for the purpose of placement. This examination will be given in the week preced - ing initial registration. It is the student's responsibility to arrive on campus in time to take this examination. No student will be permitted to enroll for courses until the results of this place - ment examination are delivered to the director of graduate studies. Master of Arts Degree Admission Requirements Undergraduate major in Latin or Greek or the equivalent. Graduate Record Examination General Test required. Course Requirements A minimum of 30 credit hours of Latin, Greek, or classics courses, of which at least 22 credit hours must be in Latin or Greek. One course involving the writing of a term paper. Final Examination Sight translation examination (two hours) in Latin or Greek. Written examination (two hours) on the history of Greek or Latin literature. Language Requirement Reading proficiency in one language: French, German, or an - other approved modern language, or (for students majoring in Latin) classical Greek. The requirement in classical Greek may be satisfied by completing G500-G650. (The latter courses may not be taken for credit by doctoral students majoring in the Department of Classical Studies.) A grade of B or better in G650 fulfills the reading-knowledge requirement in classical Greek. Master of Arts in Teaching Degree Admission Requirements Undergraduate major in Latin or Greek or the equivalent. Graduate Record Examination General Test required. Course Requirements The total for the M.A.T. degree is 60 credit hours, of which 24 are in classes designated by the School of Education and 10 in Supervised Student Teaching. Of the remaining 26 hours, 20 are 138in courses involving Greek and/or Latin language and literature, and 6 in classical civilization and culture. Final Examination Sight translation examination (two hours) in Latin. Written examination (two hours) on the history of Latin literature. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Admission Requirements As a prerequisite for admission, a student must (1) have com - pleted at least 24 credit hours of graduate work in classical studies; (2) show proficiency in one modern foreign language; (3) show evidence of scholarly potential as indicated by the submission of a term paper or revised version of a term paper to the Ph.D. admission committee of the department; (4) sup - ply two letters of reference; and (5) take the Graduate Record Examination General Test. Course Requirements A total of 90 credit hours, including dissertation (maximum of 28 credit hours). Fifty-three (53) credit hours must consist of the 20 credit hours of core requirements (C501, C502, G536, G537, L536, and L537) and 33 additional credit hours of Latin and Greek reading and seminar courses. The remaining credit hours are distributed among the courses in the minor program. Minor A total of 12 to 15 credit hours of course work, to be planned in consultation with the director of graduate studies. Minor pro - grams aim to broaden the student's knowledge in some aspect of classical studies outside the core curriculum. A minor may be taken in a single department (e.g., fine arts, comparative literature, history); in that case, the student should also consult with the director of graduate studies in that department. An in - terdepartmental minor (examples include \"ancient studies\" and \"mythology studies\") combines course work in other depart - ments with appropriate courses in classical studies. Another possibility is an interdepartmental minor in \"related fields,\" with courses selected from comparative literature, fine arts, folklore, history, history and philosophy of science, linguis - tics, medieval studies, philosophy, religious studies, Renais - sance studies, or any other appropriate department or school (e.g., law or music); the aim of this \"related fields\" minor is to introduce the student to methodologies and approaches other than the philological, which may be applied to the study of the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome. Language Requirements Reading proficiency in French and German; substitution for French of one other modern language will be considered on pe - tition. This requirement must be completed before the qualify - ing examinations may be taken. Qualifying Examinations Translation examinations (three hours each) based on reading lists in Greek and in Latin. Students should have passed the reading list translation examinations in both Latin and Greek by the end of the third year (if they were admitted to the M.A. program) or by the end of the second year (if they were admitted to the Ph.D. program with an M.A. degree). Qualify - ing examinations are also required on the history of Greek and Latin literature (three hours each) and on a major author (three hours) chosen by the student. Students should have passed all three of the qualifying examinations by the end of the fourth year (if they were admitted to the M.A. program) or by the end of the second year (if they were admitted to the Ph.D. program with an M.A. degree). An examination on the outside minor may be required by the department of the outside minor. Final Examination Oral, primarily a defense of the dissertation. Ph.D. Minor in Greek or Latin Prospective minors should obtain a copy of \"Graduate Minors in Latin and Greek\" from the administrative secretary in Bal - lantine Hall 547 and plan their course work in advance with the director of graduate studies (Department of Classical Studies). Courses The 500-level courses are intended to emphasize the reading of texts in the original language; 600-level seminars and stud - ies are intended to provide a specialized focus on one topic or theme with greater attention to scholarship and secondary literature.

Degree Offered Master of Science, Graduate Certificate Special Departmental Requirements (See also general University Graduate School requirements.) Master of Science in Clinical Research Indiana University's Master of Science in Clinical Research degree program prepares health care professionals for a career in clinical research. This program offers a combination of course work and practical research experience and is a core component of Indiana University's Clinical Investigator Training Enhancement (CITE) program. The program also constitutes the formal didactic requirements for certain types of federal train - ing grants (such as K-23s) and other career awards. Following completion of the program, graduates can embark on a career in clinical research with the skills necessary to successfully com - pete for grant funding, conduct and analyze research findings, and publish work in scientific journals. Course Requirements The Master of Science program is divided equally between two main components: (1) completion of the formal curriculum and (2) active involvement in clinical research under the mentorship of a faculty scientist. Both elements are critical in preparation of the candidate for successful research following graduation. Besides didactic classes, there is substantial research training in scientific writing and grant preparation. The curriculum is de - signed to cover core competency areas through a combination of course work and mentored research. The two-year M.S. program consists of a 30 credit hour curriculum, which includes the following core courses\u2014G504, G651, G655, G660, G661, G664, N802\u2014and two approved electives. Grades An overall average of at least a B (3.0) is required. Thesis Research project (see GRAD G664 Mentored Clinical Research) is completed in lieu of thesis. Graduate Certificate in Clinical Research This is a 14 credit degree with 3 required courses (G660: Clini - cal Research Methods, G504: Research Ethics, and G661: Clini - cal Trials or G651: Biostatistics). These 3 courses will constitute 8-9 credits; the remaining 5-6 credits will consist of graduate- level elective courses that are relevant to the student's clinical interests. Courses G504 Research Ethics (2-3 cr.) An introduction to both the theory and practice of research ethics. The course also covers key ethical principles and concepts. G651 Biostatistics I (3 cr.)

Students carry out intensive research projects in state-of-the-art com - puter-based laboratories. There are two Ph.D. degree options: a standalone Ph.D. in Cognitive Science and a joint Ph.D. in Cognitive Science and another discipline; for example, psychol - ogy, computer science, philosophy, linguistics, or speech and hearing sciences. The program is designed to train students in theory development and model building (mathematical, for - mal, and computer simulation models), in empirical research, and in the development of the conceptual framework and tech146nical skills for successful careers in research, teaching, business, and government. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Admission Requirements Admission is by approval of the program's graduate admission committee. Applicants should have an undergraduate major in Cognitive Science, Psychology, Computer Science, Philosophy, Linguistics, Biology, or Anthropology; basic computer program - ming skills; and basic knowledge of mathematics for science, including calculus and statistics. In exceptional cases, the programming or mathematics admission requirements may be waived and satisfied while pursuing graduate study. Course Requirements A minimum of 90 credit hours, including the core courses COGS Q520 (3 cr.), COGS Q530 (3 COGS and COGS Q560 (3 cr.) and selec - tions totaling at least 16 credit hours from offerings listed in the Program in Cognitive Science or cross-listed with other departments, divisions, or programs. A maximum of 6 of these 16 credit hours may come from pure research courses (COGS Q799, COGS Q899, or the equivalent in another department). On the basis of their undergraduate background, students may be exempted from one or more of the core courses other than COGS Q540, which all students must take. Exemption from any core courses requires approval by the director of graduate stud - ies of the program. Students must also register for at least four semesters in the Colloquium Series course COGS Q733. In one of these semesters, the only one for which credit is received, each student will be expected to give a lecture on his or her independent research as a part of the Colloquium Series. Research Project Requirement All Cognitive Science stand-alone Ph.D. students are required to complete the Research Project requirement. The project should constitute significant original research done while the student is enrolled in the Ph.D. program. Beginning Fall 2007, all new Ph.D. students must decide on a supervisor and topic for their projects by the end of their first year and submit the Research Project Progress Report to the Cognitive Science Program of - fice. The project must be completed by the end of their second year; at this time they should submit the Completion of the Research Project Form. Content Specialization Each student will select a Content Specialization, an area of study that can be approached from the perspectives of the different disciplines within cognitive science. The list of avail - able Content Specializations currently includes Language and Speech, Modeling, Dynamical Systems, Logic, and Human- Computer Interaction, but with the approval of the student's advisory/research committee, any relevant area of cognitive science may fulfill the Content Specialization requirement. Students must complete at least five courses in their specializa - tion, and these courses must be taken in at least two differ - ent departments. The Content Specialization should normally be selected by the end of the student's second year in the program, and the courses selected must be approved by the student's advisory/research committee. Minor Requirement Students must complete a minor in another department or program. Courses counting toward the minor may also count toward the student's Content Specialization. The minor should normally be completed by the beginning of the student's fourth year. Qualifying Examination Each student is expected to pass a Qualifying Examination, normally by the first semester of the student's third year in the program. If the student fails the exam, it may be retaken once, by the end of the student's third year. Prior to the qualifying examination, each student will be ex - pected to turn in a Qualifying Examination Petition Form with the signatures of the Director of Graduate Studies and Advisory Committee. The examination is expected to have a written and an oral component and to demonstrate (1) in-depth knowledge of the student's Content Specialization, (2) knowledge of some other area of Cognitive Science, (3) academic writing competence, and (4) the ability to defend a position in an oral setting. In consultation with his or her Advisory Committee, the student will agree on the format of the examination. Within these con - straints, two broad categories of Qualifying Examinations are possible: (1) Conventional Written Examination or (2) Papers. Details regarding these categories are available from the Direc - tor of Graduate Studies, the Graduate Secretary, or his or her Advisory Committee. Joint Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Cognitive Science and Another Discipline Admission Requirements Acceptance into the Joint Cognitive Science Ph.D. program is contingent upon admission into another degree-granting program at Indiana University Bloomington, hereafter referred to as the \"originating discipline\" or \"originating department.\" Students must apply to the originating department, informing it that they also intend to join the Joint Cognitive Science Ph.D. Program. Students are required to make such a request prior to their qualification exams. There is no separate admission process through the Cognitive Science Program. Course Requirements A minimum of 90 credit hours, of which 32 credit hours must be in courses listed or cross-listed in cognitive science, includ - ing COGS Q520 (3 COGS Q733: three semes - ters at 0 credits and one semester at 1 credit when the re - quired colloquium is given by the student, and at least 6 credit 147hours of breadth coursework not in the originating discipline and not among the Q-courses or pure research courses such as Q799 and Q899. A Q-course that is not cross-listed in any other unit may satisfy the breadth requirement with the approval of the student's advisory committee. The 32 credit hours may include a maximum of 6 credit hours in pure research courses (COGS Q799, COGS Q899, or the equivalent in originating departments). Strong encouragement is given to interdisciplin - ary diversification. Note that courses may count toward the requirements of both cognitive science and the originating department. Tool-Skills Requirement Statistics PSY K300 or PSY K310 or the equivalent. Qualifying Examination There are two options for the qualifying examination: (a) an ex - amination in the originating discipline and a separate compre - hensive examination in cognitive science (these may be taken at separate times); or (b) a joint examination covering relevant areas of both the originating discipline and cognitive science, as determined by the advisory committee and with permission of both the originating discipline and the Cognitive Science Program. The cognitive science examination is normally taken after completion of the cognitive science course requirements. The examination may be repeated only once. Public Colloquium The student must give a colloquium as part of the COGS Q733 colloquium series advertised at large to the university com - munity, and covering some aspect of the student's research in cognitive science. The research covered may be from any stage of the student's career, including (but not restricted to) the thesis research. Final Examination The public and oral defense of the dissertation will be conduct - ed jointly with the student's originating discipline. Ph.D. Minor in Cognitive Science Graduate students obtaining a Ph.D. in another discipline may find that that discipline gives them the option of taking a minor in cognitive science. To obtain such a minor, students must satisfy the following requirements: (a) obtain approval from the Cognitive Science Program; and (b) complete COGS Q540; semesters of COGS Q733; and at least 6 other credit hours in cognitive science and/or cross-listed courses not in the originating discipline. Certificates in Cognitive Science The Cognitive Science Program is extremely broad, ranging from psychology to business to anthropology to computer science, to name just a few. Students in other disciplines may elect to focus on an area or areas within the broad range of cognitive science. Certificates are open to students upon request; several different cognitive science certificate programs are described in the following pages. Note that certificates are not required for a joint Ph.D. degree. The student will inform the cognitive science office, the student's cognitive science advisor, and the certificate director of intent to pursue a certifi - cate.

Drawing upon recent developments in cultural, social, and literary theory, this program emphasizes the investigation of cultural production and the social construction of values, ideas, and belief systems. Focusing on both contemporary and historical phenomena, courses in this area pay particular attention to the relationship between cultural forms and power relations in society. Issues of class, race, and gender receive prominent critical attention, as do conventional divisions between \"high culture\" and more \"popular\" forms of expression. Students in this program are en - couraged to fashion a course of study that meets their particu - lar interests and needs. Cultural Studies is especially useful for those seeking to complement studies in an area of disciplinary specialization with a more interdisciplinary minor. Course Requirements Four courses for a minimum of 13 hours of credit in courses approved for the Cultural Studies Program, including C601 and either C701 or C790. The remaining hours are mostly satisfied by taking classes that are cross-listed with the home depart -174ment of the designated instructor. Students must officially declare the minor during the early phase of their Ph.D. studies by consulting with the director of the Cultural Studies Program.

Wilhelm* Assistant Professor Ye Zhang Admissions Professor Peter Coia Rangazas* Advising Associate Professor Anne Royalty* Degree Offered Master of Arts Program Information The Master of Arts in economics has a twofold objective: (1) to provide students with analytical capabilities and research skills for careers in business, government, and the nonprofit sec - tor; and (2) to prepare those who wish to pursue the Ph.D. at another university or Indiana University Bloomington. Special Departmental Requirements (See also general University Graduate School requirements.) Admission Requirements Applicants should have completed a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution. Ordinarily, applicants should have a mini - mum grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale in their under - graduate course work and in their previous economics courses. Before undertaking graduate study in economics, a student should have knowledge of intermediate-level undergraduate economic theory (E321 and E322), statistics (E270), multivari - ate differential and integral calculus (the IUPUI equivalents are M165 and M166 offered by the mathematics department). Students with deficiencies in economics and/or mathematics may be admitted on a conditional basis. The verbal, quantitative, and analytical portions of the Gradu - ate Record Examination (GRE) are required, and applicants are urged to complete the examination by December of the year before admission. Requests to substitute GMAT scores for GRE scores will be considered. Three letters of recommendation are required. For students with English as a second language, a minimum TOEFL score of at least 550 is recommended. Successful completion of ELS 112 will be accepted in lieu of TOEFL for admission. Those who seek financial support should continue to submit the TOEFL and would normally need a score of 600 or better to receive an award. Master of Arts Degree Course Requirements Students must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of graduate work, which may include up to 6 credits of thesis. Twelve (12) credits are devoted to the following required core courses: E504 Mathematics for Economists, E521 Theory of Prices and Markets, E622 Theory of Income and Employment, and E570 Fundamentals of Statistics and Econometrics. These core courses serve as the prerequisites for some of the 500- level field courses. No more than 9 of the remaining 18 credits may be earned in courses numbered below 500. If a thesis is written, it must be defended. If a thesis is not written, there will be a comprehensive written examination with an oral de - fense in an area of specialization within economics. Students have the option of replacing the thesis with read - ing proficiency in a foreign language or with 6 credit hours of course work in tool skills such as mathematics, statistics, or computer science. Consult the department's Graduate Study Guide for a list of acceptable research-skill courses. Courses 194carrying graduate credit taken to meet the language or tool skill options are counted toward the 30 credits required for the degree. Grades The student must receive at least a C (2.0) in each course and must average at least a B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) for all courses taken. Dual Degree: Master of Arts in Economics and Master of Arts in Philanthropic Studies The dual master's degree in economics and philanthropic studies substantially benefits students intending to pursue a career in independent research, academia, or practice. Nor - mally, those pursuing a career in research or academia con - tinue in a Ph.D. program in economics, finance, accounting, management, marketing, or public policy. Very few doctoral programs include substantial content on philanthropy or non - profit organizations. As such, the M.A. in philanthropic studies provides a broad interdisciplinary background that makes the future researcher sensitive to the institutional details, values, and history of the sector, thus leading to better research. For the future nonprofit manager or leader, economics provides the principles and methodologies to make informed decisions on the appreciative level, the policy level, and the managerial level. Admission requirements for the dual degree program are iden - tical to those for each program separately. Separate applica - tion must be made to each of the two programs. Students are expected to take responsibility for learning about and meeting the admission requirements of each school individually, which may differ from each other in application documents required, minimal standards of criteria for admission, and deadline dates. Students must make plans early with advisors in both programs to identify (1) common courses and (2) thesis credit. Study for the two degrees can be combined for a total of 51 credit hours rather than the 66 credit hours that would be required if the two degrees were taken separately. Two of the required core courses for the M.A. in economics may be selected as electives to meet the Philanthropic Studies Program requirement for two applied electives. One of the required phil - anthropic studies courses, ECON E514 The Nonprofit Economy and Public Policy, may be taken to meet 3 of the 12 credit hours of electives required in the economics program. A common thesis meets the requirements of both departments. Further information regarding regulations governing advanced degree programs may be obtained from the respective depart - ments.

Minors Ph.D. students in English may take minors in the following departments and programs: American studies, African Ameri - can and African Diaspora studies, art history, comparative literature, cultural studies, English and German philology, film studies, folklore, French, gender studies, German, Greek, history, Italian, journalism, Latin, linguistics, medieval studies, performance studies, philosophy, religion, Renaissance stud - ies, Slavics, Spanish, theatre and drama, Victorian studies, and West European studies. Requirements for the minor are set by the minor department. The Department of English offers the following minors: Ameri - can literature, British literature, children's literature, peda - gogy, creative writing, English and Germanic philology, English language, literary theory, and textual studies. Minors within the department must be approved by the director of graduate studies. Qualifying Examination The qualifying examination is taken in two parts: an oral ex - amination based upon a reading list and a written dissertation prospectus. Assuming the student enters the program without the M.A., the exams are taken in his or her fourth year in the program. The oral is taken in September; the prospectus must be completed the following spring and defended no later than the second week of May. The oral examines a student's qualifi - cations as a specialist in his or her chosen field; the prospectus and defense examine a student's qualifications and readiness for undertaking the dissertation. Details of the examination procedure are available from the director of graduate studies (DGS). Oral In her third year the student chooses a topic and designs a reading list in consultation with her advisory committees. A reading list covers a clearly defined field of scholarship in Eng - lish and illustrates a command of that field. The two-hour oral, to be held in September of the student's fourth year, is sched - uled at the convenience of the student and her committee. The oral examination may be repeated once. Prospectus Following the successful completion of the first oral exami - nation, the student names his dissertation committee and registers for W795, the dissertation prospectus writing work - shop taught by the DGS. He writes the prospectus and prepares the bibliography in consultation with his faculty and with the instructor of W795. When the prospectus is ready to be ap - proved, the student submits it to his committee and arranges a time for the second exam meeting for the defense of the prospectus. This second exam meeting is held no later than the second week of May in the student's fourth year in the program. In this two-hour oral members of the student's dissertation commit - tee examine the claims and aims of the prospectus as well as the dissertation it imagines, and assess the student's prepared - ness to undertake a long-term independent research project.

Degrees Offered Master of Arts, Certificate in Teaching English as a Second Lan - guage, Certificate in Professional Editing, Certificate in Teaching Writing Program Information IUPUI's graduate English program has been designed to prepare students for careers in the analysis and production of \"texts.\" To this end, the program covers issues and skills in reading and writing, in the richest sense of these words, to prepare students to address these issues and to teach these skills. Graduates of the program should be prepared for such careers as teaching writing and literature; teaching English as a second language; and writing for business, government, and other professions. In contrast to traditional M.A. programs, which place heavy emphasis on literary history, the IUPUI program focuses on the application of English studies to contemporary situations and problems. Although interested students will be encouraged to take courses in literary history, graduates of this program will no doubt have to take additional literary history courses to be qualified candidates for traditional doctoral programs. Because of IUPUI's urban, nonresidential setting, its English graduate program will strive, in its curriculum and scheduling, to meet the special needs of part-time, nonresidential students.

The Ph.D. in environmental science is awarded by the Univer - sity Graduate School. The program provides a rigorous, comprehensive education in environmental science. The specific objectives of the program are: (1) to conduct advanced research and scientific analysis of environmental events, issues, and problems; (2) to further understanding of the nature and management of natural and human environments; and (3) to provide an opportunity for students and faculty members in several departments to engage in collaborative environmental research in an interdisci - plinary mode. Admission A student must apply to the School of Public and Environ - mental Affairs for doctoral studies; those accepted will be recommended to the University Graduate School for formal admission into the Ph.D. program. Applicants to this program must have completed at least a bachelor's degree in science, mathematics, engineering, or a related field. Prospective stu - dents are required to submit (1) a statement of purpose, which should be as specific as possible and, preferably, should refer to potential research mentors by name; (2) official results of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE); (3) official transcripts of all undergraduate and graduate course work completed; and (4) three letters of recommendation. Applicants whose native language is not English must also submit results of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Degree Requirements The degree requires: (1) substantial knowledge in a primary en - vironmental science concentration; (2) breadth in related envi - ronmental science and policy; (3) an understanding of research methods; (4) an in-depth knowledge of the dissertation topic; and (5) a dissertation that demonstrates the student's ability to analyze, explain, and interpret research clearly and effectively. Advisory Committee During the first semester of enrollment, each student must organize an advisory committee. Normally this committee consists of at least four faculty members: at least two should be from the School of Public and Environmental Affairs; the others may be from other departments or from outside the univer - sity. Membership of the advisory committee is approved by the director of the Doctoral Program in Environmental Science and the dean of the University Graduate School.

The student should prepare a proposal outlining a program of course work that the student believes lies within that field. Each student should prepare a program of course work that fulfills the requirement of breadth in environmental science and policy. The breadth requirement may be fulfilled by using a wide spectrum of environmentally related courses, including areas such as economics, law, and management, in addition to other science courses. Each student is also required to prepare a statement of courses or activities for meeting the research methods requirement. Normally these include subjects such as computer science, geographic information systems, remote sensing, statistics, and mathematical modeling, although other technical skill areas such as electronics and analytical chemical techniques may be appropriate for some students. Narrative statement Each student must prepare a narrative statement that includes a discussion of the student's previous education experiences, a statement of career objectives, a statement of research inter - ests, and a proposed program of course work. Each student must submit the narrative statement to the advi - sory committee for approval, usually during the first semester in the program. Course Requirements The exact nature and amount of course work in each of three areas\u2014principal field of study, breadth in environmental sci - ence and policy, and research methods\u2014is determined by the advisory committee after review and approval of the student's proposed plan of study in each of these areas. Selection of specific courses is based on obtaining (1) adequate knowledge for qualifying examinations, (2) appropriate preparation for a research project, and (3) a mixture of courses that meet the individual professional goals of the student. The Ph.D. requires the completion of at least 90 credit hours in advanced study and research beyond the bachelor's degree. A student must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of advanced course work in environmental science and policy. Students must also complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of research, normally taken as SPEA-E 625 or SPEA-E 890. The student, with approval of the advisory committee, should complete some combination of additional course work and research sufficient to meet the 90 credit hour requirement. Each student is required to enroll in SPEA-E 680 Seminar in Environmental Science and Policy (1 credit hour/semester) for four semesters during the course of their degree program. Students enrolled in SPEA-E 680 may either make a formal presentation or write a brief synopsis and critique of four presentations attended each semester. Students are encour - aged to enroll in SPEA-E 710 Advanced Topics in Environmental Science, which may be taken multiple times, as the topics vary. 219Advanced topics courses and reading courses may be used to meet requirements, depending upon the topic and the stu - dent's area of interest. Students should note that all 30 credit hours of advanced course work, if properly selected, and 6 credit hours of re - search, may be applied toward the Master of Science in Environmental Science (M.S.E.S.) degree. With an additional 12 credit hours of approved course work, a student may be awarded the M.S.E.S. degree while completing the require - ments for the Ph.D. degree in environmental science. Comple - tion of the M.S.E.S. degree as part of this doctoral program is not a requirement; however, this option may be appropriate for some students. Qualifying Examinations Before a student is admitted to candidacy, all requirements determined by the advisory committee must be met and the qualifying examinations passed. A student who fails qualifying examinations may retake them only once. The decision to admit a student to doctoral candidacy is made by the advisory committee, which evaluates the student's per - formance in the written examination, research proposal, and oral examination. Written Examination This examination should be taken by the end of the student's fifth semester in the Ph.D. program. The exam focuses on topics covered by the student's course work and related to the student's research interests. The examination is written and graded by the student's advisory committee. The written examination is graded as pass, conditional pass, or fail. Research Proposal No later than the end of the fifth semester, the student should submit a written research proposal for review by the advisory committee. The proposal should be documented, clearly stat - ing a research objective, the approach to be taken, and the significance of the work. Oral Examination Each candidate is examined orally by the advisory committee. The oral examination expands upon the written examination and covers the student's research proposal. Research Committee Upon the student's successful completion of the qualifying examinations, a research committee is formed. Normally this committee consists of at least four faculty members: at least two should be from the School of Public and Environmental Af - fairs; the others may be from other departments. The director of the Doctoral Program in Environmental Science recommends the student's research committee to the dean of the University Graduate School. At least three members of the research com - mittee must be full members of the graduate faculty. Students are required to submit an annual report (1-2 pages) of their progress to be approved by their advisory or research committee during an annual review meeting arranged by the student and their primary advisor by April 15 each year. This report should contain the following: provisional thesis title, nomination of advisory or research committee (date complet - ed), course work completed (projected date; date completed), qualifying exam (projected date; date completed), brief outline of research objectives, detailed summary of progress and relevant activities, summary of research plans for the next year, and proposed long-term research plans and timetable. Dissertation A dissertation is required and must be of sufficient value to warrant publication. The dissertation must represent a sub - stantial research effort, both in quality and quantity. The dis - sertation requirement may be met by preparing a traditional dissertation or by preparing a portfolio of research documents including publications, manuscripts in press, and a completed manuscript suitable for submission to a journal. These docu - ments may have multiple authors, although the doctoral candidate must demonstrate that he or she made significant contributions to at least two of the publications or manuscripts submitted for review. The research portfolio must have intro - ductory and concluding chapters to integrate across the topics. The research portfolio also must be prepared to meet the University Graduate School's requirements for dissertations. A public presentation of the dissertation research is required. The dissertation must be approved by the research committee. Ph.D. Minor in Environmental Studies (12 credit hours) Students in Ph.D. programs at Indiana University may, with the consent of their advisory committee, choose environmental studies as an outside minor. The minor is flexible and is usually designed by students in accordance with their needs. Requirements 1. The doctoral candidate must secure a faculty advisor in consultation with the director of the Doctoral Program in Environmental Science. The advisor may not be from the candidate's major department. The candidate's advisor serves as the representative in all examinations or other requirements of the candidate's Ph.D. program that relate to the minor. The advisor decides on the character of the examination, if any, in the minor field and certifies that the candidate has met the requirements of the minor. 2. The candidate must take at least 12 credit hours of gradu - ate-level courses related to environmental studies. These courses must be from at least two different disciplines outside the candidate's major department. The choice of courses should be made in consultation with the candi - date's advisor and must be approved by the director of the Doctoral Program in Environmental Science. Acceptance of the proposed minor is based on two criteria: (1) the courses must have a direct relationship to environmental studies, and (2) the courses must not normally be required as part of major or tool skill options in the student's major depart - ment. Courses in the minor program should be selected ac - cording to the student's interest. Students majoring in areas other than the natural sciences, for example, may wish to consider course offerings in the natural sciences; similarly, 220natural science students might consider course offerings in the social and behavioral sciences. 3. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (B) must be attained in all courses used for the minor.

A focus on gender as an analytic category facilitates an array of scholarly collaborations, reflecting new theoretical and methodological developments in diverse fields such as the social sciences, the arts and humanities, the natural sciences, and policy studies. Categories of difference that articulate with gender\u2014such as race, ethnicity, class, and religion\u2014are vertical grids of attention throughout the doctoral degree program. The Department emphasizes integrative and transdisciplinary modes of analysis for the study of sexualities and sexual identi - ties, bodies and their technologization and medicalization, representation and social/cultural production, and feminist epistemologies. Five unique core courses form the heart of the program: G598 Feminist Theory: Classic Texts and Founding Debates, G600 Concepts of Gender, G603 Contemporary Debates in Feminist Theory, G702 Researching Gender Issues.246Areas of Concentration In addition, students select one of three areas of concentration: Medicine, Science, and Technologies of the Body Sexualities, Desires, Identities Cultural Representations and Media Practices Note that these concentrations are flexible and overlapping to some extent. Students may change their area of concentration as they move through the program. Special Requirements (See also general University Graduate School requirements.) Doctor of Philosophy degree Admission Requirements Applicants for graduate admission must hold baccalaureate degrees from accredited four-year collegiate institutions. For graduate admission the College requires a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher. We require the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) be taken in the past five years. We prefer a score of 600 or higher on either the verbal or quantitative sections of the examination. The institution code for Indiana University is 1324. All applicants must ask ETS to forward GRE scores to IU using this code. For applicants whose native language is not English, the College and the University Graduate School require proof of proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and understanding English. In almost all cases proficiency should be demon - strated by achieving a score of 213 or higher on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Course Requirements Students will complete at least 60 credit hours of course work, which includes 15 credit hours of core courses, 15 credit hours in a chosen area of concentration, and a 12 credit hour gradu - ate minor (taken either in another department or designed on an intra- or interdepartmental basis). Note that courses in one's area of concentration, as well as additional elective courses, may be taken outside the Department of Gender Studies. Only those students intending to pursue the Ph.D. will be admitted to the program. However, a Master's degree may be obtained upon satisfactory completion of its requirements, which are: four of the five required core courses for the doc - torate; a minimum of nine additional credit hours in GNDR, including two courses at the 600 level and one at the 700 level; a substantive research essay of publishable quality; and up to nine credit hours of approved elective courses outside Gender Studies. A total of 30 credit hours of course work is required to obtain the Master's degree. Students who have completed the M.A. in Gender Studies at IUB must at that point be approved for admission to the Ph.D. program. Foreign Language Requirement Gender Studies does not require a foreign language for all stu - dents. However, if a candidate is engaged in transnational gen - der scholarship, a foreign language may be formally required. The DGS will determine the means by which proficiency will be demonstrated. Research Skills Beyond the required core course G702 Researching Gender Issues, there is no specific research-related skill requirement. However, a student's advisor may require additional compe - tency in (a) research skill(s) appropriate to that student's dis - sertation topic. Such requirements may include competency in a second language, statistical methods, questionnaire develop - ment, ethnographic methods, interviewing techniques, textual or media analysis, computing/internet/webmaster operations, specific laboratory skills, other research and technical skills, or appropriate combinations of any of these. These studies are to be undertaken early in the candidate's graduate career. The as - sessment and completion of any required research competen - cies normally must be certified by the DGS prior to admission to candidacy. Additional Requirements after Admission with Master's Degree Candidates admitted with a master's degree from another in - stitution may be required to take additional preparatory work, depending on their background and training. The program will be decided in consultation with the student's faculty advisor and the DGS. Qualifying Examination and the Dissertation Defense Qualifying examinations (both written and oral) are to be taken approximately 8 months after the completion of course work. Upon successful completion of the qualifying examination and presentation of a satisfactory dissertation proposal, the student will be nominated to candidacy for the Ph.D. The Dissertation Committee, which must be approved by the Dean of the Gradu - ate School, will be responsible for directing and evaluating the thesis. The dissertation defense serves as the final oral exami - nation and will cover topics related to the dissertation and area of specialization. Ph.D. Minor in Gender Studies Course Requirements A Ph.D. Minor in Gender Studies requires 4 GNDR courses (at least 12 credit hours), which may include courses that are joint-listed with other departments. At least 1 of these courses must be chosen from the following: G600, G603, G700, G702. Students may petition for no more than 1 non-GNDR course to count towards the minor; the Director of Graduate Studies must deem such a course to have significant Gender Stud - ies content. A maximum of 3 credits may be transferred from graduate work completed at another university, provided the Director of Graduate Studies approves the course content. Plans for the minor must be made in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies. Grades Only grades of B (3.0) and above will count for credit. 247Examination None required. A Gender Studies faculty member may be in - vited to attend the student's oral qualifying examination. Courses Descrip tion of Core Required Courses (15 credit hours) G600 Concepts of Gender (3 cr.) This course introduces histori - cal, theoretical, behavioral, philosophical, scientific, and multi- and cross-cultural perspectives on gender and its meanings, exploring its disciplinary and interdisciplinary uses and impli - cations.

Most work on this subject unfolds through consideration of diverse critical paradigms. Study in the Institute is linked closely, but not exclusively, to the mas - ter's degree in modern German culture in the Department of Germanic Studies and is also open to students from related dis - ciplines (e.g., West European Studies, History, Political Science, Philosophy, the Program in Cultural Studies, the Jewish Studies Program, and the School of Music). The Institute also offers a Ph.D. minor. Courses are taught by the faculty of the Depart - ment of Germanic Studies specializing in 1740 to the present and by instructors in related disciplines. Ph.D. Minor in German Studies The Ph.D. minor in German studies is available to doctoral students in all departments except Germanic Studies; 15 credit hours of course work are required.

Master's Degrees Master of Arts Degree Students may follow one of two different curricula in pursuit of the M.A. degree: Master of Arts in Germanic Studies and Mas - ter of Arts in Modern German Culture. Admission requirements are the same for both programs, and the official degree title for both options is the M.A. in Germanic Studies. Admission Requirements Near-native command of German and undergraduate major in the field or other evidence of adequate background. Deficien - cies may be removed by course work or special examination. Master's Project Both the Master of Arts in Germanic Studies and the Master of Arts in Modern German Culture require successful completion of a master's project, which is intended to give students experi - ence in carrying out a limited scholarly investigation to their fullest potential. The project is normally submitted after three or four semesters of study but may be submitted as early as the first year. It entails appropriate revision and oral defense of a research paper of 20 to 30 pages originally written for a gradu - ate course in Germanic Studies. The paper should demonstrate command of expository English or German, competence in the use of bibliographic and research tools, ability to conceive and develop a scholarly project, and effective critical and analytical thinking. It is recommended that students consult with appro - priate faculty members regarding selection and revision of the project paper. A three-person faculty committee evaluates each project and conducts an oral defense that examines the candi -264date's ability to present concisely the main argument(s) of the project, place the project in larger scholarly contexts, discuss sources and scholarly literature used, and respond effectively to committee members' questions and comments. Students have the option of enrolling in German G850 Master's Project for one credit so that the project's completion is reflected on their permanent academic record and transcripts. Master of Arts in Germanic Studies Course Requirements A total of 30 credit hours, including one seminar or colloquium at Indiana University. At least 9 additional credit hours in Germanic studies and one Germanic Literature course numbered 500 or above.

Kahn Departmental E-mail global@indiana.edu Departmental URL www.indiana.edu/~global/academic/minor.php Graduate Faculty Courses which meet the criteria of the Ph.D. Minor in Global Studies are taught by faculty from across the university. Ph.D. Minor in Global Studies Conventi onal definitions of nations and even entire world regions as discrete and bounded systems are becoming increas - ingly blurred as profound and powerful trends transform the globe. The Ph.D. Minor in Global Studies enables the inter - disciplinary study and critical analysis of issues and problems that transcend national boundaries and world areas such as global environmental sustainability, universal human rights, cyber security; transnational criminal organization, the study of the emergence of constitutional democracies in transitional societies, global humanities, minority linguistic and cultural right world-wide, and many other issues, topics, or problems of global interest. Course Requirements Each student's program is developed individually, in consulta - tion between the student, the major advisor, and the director of the Ph.D. Minor in Global Studies. One core course, GRAD I701 Issues and Approaches to Global Studies, is required. Four additional elective courses, drawn from at least two different disciplines and reflecting a coherent and purposive thematic approach to the global issues or issues to be dealt with, will be selected, with the advice and approval of the advisors and the Global Studies Ph.D. Minor Advisory Committee. A capstone project\u2014whether a specific course, an international internship, international field work, a substantial paper, or a question on the student's qualifying examination in the major depart - ment\u2014completes the minor, for a minimum of 15 credit hours. Foreign Language Requirement To be an effective researcher and instructor in global affairs, minors should possess strong foreign language skills in at least one modern language. Minors must demonstrate foreign language competency at a level determined by the student's approved program of study. Testing will be administered by the appropriate foreign language department or area studies program. Examinations Although a 3.7 or higher GPA in Global Studies courses would normally exempt the student from having to take a written comprehensive examination, the final decision regarding a qualifying examination rests with the student's doctoral field advisor and the Global Studies Director. Students who opt for the qualifying examination to satisfy their capstone project are required to take a written comprehensive examination regard - less of their GPA. Courses Courses which meet the criteria of the Ph.D. Minor in Global Studies come from more than a dozen academic and profes - sional schools. Sample courses are listed on the minor Web site. The Center for the Study of Global Change provides the core courses as well as special topics courses. GRAD I500 Topics in Global Studies (3 cr.) This seminar focuses on the intensive study and analysis of selected global problems and issues within an interdisciplinary format. Topics will vary but will cut across fields, regions, and/or periods. GRAD I701 Multidisciplinary Seminar on Issues and Approach - es in Global Studies (3 cr.) This graduate seminar is designed to stimulate students to think critically about a broad range of theoretical and methodological issues involved in global re - search, including ethics, conceptual frameworks, and research design from different disciplinary perspectives, etc. GRAD I702 Independent Study in Global Studies (1-4 cr.) This is an independent study course supervised by the Director of the Graduate Studies Ph.D. Minor. It will encourage graduate students to research, investigate, and synthesize scholarship that crosses disciplines and regions in support of their Global Studies Minor program. This independent study course can also be used to fulfill the Global Studies Capstone Project as required by the Global Studies Ph.D. Minor.270University Graduate School 2009-2010 Academic Bulletin Health, Physical Education, and Recreation University Graduate School Kirkwood Hall 111 Indiana University Bloomington, IN 47405 (812) 855-8853 Contact: grdschl@indiana.edu School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation Bloomington Departmental E-mail hper@indiana.edu Departmental URL www.hper.indiana.edu Dean Robert M.

Special School Requirements (See also general Graduate School requirements.) Doctor of Philosophy Admission Requirements Applicants for the Ph.D. in health behavior, human perfor - mance, or leisure behavior must possess at least the equivalent of an undergraduate minor in the field of study to be pursued. Appropriate academic background in the physical, biologi - cal, and social and behavioral sciences is required. Prescribed deficiency work ordinarily cannot be counted among credit hours required for the degree. Other admission criteria are grade point averages earned in all undergraduate and gradu - ate work, scores on the Graduate Record Examination General Test, and letters of recommendation from professors or others who are able to evaluate the applicant's potential for success in advanced graduate study. Admission applications can be completed online at www.gradapp.indiana.edu/. Course Requirements A minimum of 90 credit hours beyond the baccalaureate degree, of which at least 30 credit hours must be in the major area of emphasis. The remaining credit hours are to be distrib - uted among the minor(s), supportive electives that include a substantial amount of work in statistics and research methodol - ogy, and dissertation (20-30 credit hours). Fifteen (15) credit hours excluding courses taken to complete the research and languages requirement are required outside of the student's major department. Elective or minor course work must clearly support the devel - opment of research competency in the major field. Frequent involvement in research projects (with or without academic credit) is essential to the program. Deficiencies in course work must be removed during the first year of study. All Ph.D. students must present T590 and T591, or their equiva - lents, as prerequisites to the major work. Grades All doctoral students must maintain a grade point average of at least 3.0 (B). Grades of C- (1.7) and below will be calculated in the student's grade point average, but courses in which such grades are earned cannot be counted toward degree require - ments. Minor(s) At least one minor in a supporting area outside the major department is required, which must be in a discipline related to, but distinct from, the major field(s) of study. The number of required credit hours is determined by the unit in which the minor is taken (usually 12-15). Foreign Language/Research-Skill Requirement One of four options: 1. reading proficiency in two languages; 2. proficiency in depth in one language; 3. reading proficiency in one language plus an approved research skill; 4. other approved combination of research skills (9 credit hour minimum). The option pursued must clearly enhance the student's ability to pursue research in the specific field of study and must have the approval of the student's advisory committee and the as - sociate dean of academic program administration. Research skills may be selected from, but are not limited to, areas such as computer science, mathematics, electronics, engineering, chemistry, and statistics. Qualifying Examination Written and oral; may not be taken until the student is within one course of completing all prescribed course work and the foreign language/research-skill requirement has been complet - ed. Examination periods are regularly scheduled for September, February, and June. Applications must be filed at least 30 days in advance. Research Proposal The proposal meeting will be open to faculty and students in the university community. During the first portion the student will formally present her/his dissertation proposal in an open forum. Committee members and visitors will have the opportu - nity to ask questions. Visitors will leave after the formal presen - tation. The remaining time will be determined by the student's research committee. Final Examination Oral defense of the dissertation. Ph.D. Minor in Human Performance Doctoral students in other departments can complete a minor in a specific emphasis by satisfactorily completing 15 credit hours of graduate-level course work which has been approved by the minor field representative on the doctoral advisory com - mittee. A qualifying examination is required. No more than 6 of 272the required 15 credit hours may be transferred from another institution.

Master of Science in Therapeutic Outcomes Research This graduate program is offered through the University Gradu - ate School. This program is designed to prepare credentialed health care professionals to conduct patient outcomes research in order to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interven - tions within their own disciplines. The chief feature of this program is the emphasis on original research to determine therapeutic benefit in terms of physiologic, symptomatic, func - tional, perceptional, and quality-of-life outcomes. There have been three major eras in the evolution of the U.S. health care system since the late 1940s: expansion, cost- containment, and now assessment and accountability. In the expansion era, health care underwent remarkable growth in technology, training, and delivery. Emphasis was on the perfec - tion of health care, with no consideration of costs or resource demands. Spiraling costs and disenchantment with the curative power of technology brought on the cost-containment era. Emphasis was then placed on limiting spending and maximizing productivity, often at the expense of patient satisfaction. Today, there is a growing understanding of the balance between use of healthcare resources on one hand and patient benefits on the other, or between assessment and accountability. Based on a more sophisticated awareness of what actually constitutes the costs and benefits of treatment, emphasis is now placed on rational use of resources in light of a realistic appraisal of therapeutic benefits. Patient-centered outcomes research concentrates on the assessment of therapeutic in - terventions under conditions of real, not ideal, practice. Allied health professionals are particularly well positioned to conduct therapeutic outcomes research because their clinical work is oriented toward the holistic factors that outcomes research purports to measure: multidimensional assessment of health status and improvement of patient quality of life. Moreover, as demand for useful and valuable outcomes measurement con - tinues to grow among healthcare institutions and organizations, allied health professionals are increasingly being called upon to conduct outcomes assessment at their place of employment. Admission Requirements Students accepted into the program must meet complete university, school, and program admission requirements. The minimum admission requirements are as follows. 1. An appropriate level of achievement on the general Gradu - ate Record Examination (GRE). Test scores of at least 500 on verbal and analytical sections OR for those students en - rolled in the Certificate in Health Sciences Patient Centered Outcomes (see certificate description below), completion of all four courses in the certificate with a grade of B (3.0) or better in each course. 2. Two letters of recommendation from those familiar with the applicant's academic and professional performance. 3. Eligibility for license or credential in a health care profession. Exceptions to those requirements may be granted by the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences Academic Studies and Research Development Committee upon written petition from the applicant and with written recommendation from the Therapeutic Outcomes Research program director. The petition must include a full statement of conditions justifying the excep - tion. Conditional admission will be for a stated time period and will entail specific conditions to be met to receive regular admission status. No student will be permitted to work toward a degree without first being admitted to the Master of Science Program. Prior Course Work Applied Toward Degree Requirements A maximum of 6 graduate credit hours earned at Indiana University before admission may be applied toward a degree. Upon the recommendation of the Therapeutic Outcomes Research program director and with the approval of the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences Academic Studies and Re - search Development Committee, up to 8 credit hours of gradu - ate work at other institutions may be transferred in partial ful - fillment of degree requirements. No course may be transferred from another institution unless the course was completed with a grade of B or higher within five years before matriculation in the Master of Science degree program. Application Materials An applicant must submit completed application forms to the Office of Academic and Student Affairs, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. Transcripts from all universities at - tended must be included. Indiana University graduates should request that the registrar's office send unofficial copies of their transcripts. Non-Indiana University graduates must submit at least one official transcript from each university attended. Course Requirements A total of 30 credit hours beyond the bachelor's degree, of which 12 credit hours are in health outcomes, 3 credit hours are in electives, and 15 credit hours are in research (including thesis work). Thesis Requirement The capstone experience is the writing and submission of a thesis based on original research conducted by the student and supervised by a thesis committee. Curricular electives are fo - cused on developing expertise to articulate and research a test - able hypothesis in a specific content area pertaining to patient- centered outcomes under the direction of a research advisor holding graduate faculty membership in University Graduate School. Theses must follow the Indiana University Guide to the Preparation of Theses and Dissertations. 276Curriculum Health Outcomes (12 cr.) SHRS W510 Trends and Issues in the Health Sciences (3 cr.)

Moreover, the department is strongly committed to inter - disciplinary programs, and it works closely with area studies programs, journals, and historical organizations. The graduate program is designed to help students in the development of their knowledge and of their critical and analytical skills. Cours - es and programs in the Department of History prepare students for work as professional historians in a variety of settings: in public history, editing, librarianship, and government service, as well as in historical research and teaching at all levels. Special Departmental Requirements (See also general University Graduate School requirements.) Master of Arts Degree Admission Requirements (1) Bachelor's degree from a recognized institution, including 24 undergraduate credit hours in history, an overall under - graduate B (3.0) average, and a superior record in history; (2) at least one score above 600 on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test; (3) three letters of recommendation; (4) a personal statement concerning intellectual interests and pro - fessional aspirations; and (5) a sample of written work, such as a term paper, thesis, or any other piece of writing that indicates ability to communicate well in nonfiction prose. Ideally, a writ - ing sample should also demonstrate the applicant's ability to conduct historical research. The History department discourag - es applicants who wish to pursue terminal M.A. degrees except in the case of the M.A./M.L.S and M.A.T. programs. Grades No grade below B- (2.7) in history courses will be counted toward this degree. Course Requirements A total of 30 credit hours; at least 20 of these credit hours must be in the Department of History. Students are required to complete H601 and at least one seminar and two colloquia; the remaining credit hours in history must be completed in gradu - ate colloquia, seminars, or readings courses. Graduate students will be allowed to receive credit for undergraduate courses only in special cases (such as in the study of fields not commonly available at the undergraduate level, or in small fields). Foreign Language Requirement Reading proficiency in one of the following languages: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, ancient Greek, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, or another language ap - propriate to the student's program of study, if approved by the University Graduate School. Students may demonstrate proficiency by any of the three methods normally sanctioned by the University Graduate School or by passing a reading examination prepared by mem - bers of the history department faculty. The examination in - cludes two texts of approximately 400 words each, one drawn from primary historical sources and the other typically drawn from historiographical sources. A student will be expected to translate the first text and answer critical questions about the second. Field Review M.A. candidates wishing to enter the Ph.D. program and those terminating their program with the master's degree must be recommended for the M.A. degree by the appropriate field committee. Graduate students who enter with an M.A. from another institution will be reviewed a year after pursuing graduate work at IU. Master of Arts for Teachers Degree Admission Requirements Same as for the Master of Arts degree except that reading abil - ity in a foreign language is not required. Grades No grade below B- (2.7) in history courses will be counted toward this degree. Course Requirements Requirements are a total of 20 or more credit hours in history and 36 credit hours in all courses. Students are required to complete H601 and at least one seminar and two colloquia; the remaining credit hours in history must be completed in gradu - ate colloquia, seminars, or readings courses. Graduate students will be allowed to receive credit for undergraduate courses only in special cases (such as in the study of fields not commonly available at the undergraduate level, or in small fields). M.A.T. students are strongly encouraged to complete one of the peda - gogy courses offered by the History Department: H580, H591, or H593.281Foreign Language Requirement None. Final Examination None. Dual Master of Arts and Master of Library Science Degrees Study for these two degrees can be combined for a total of 50 credit hours rather than the 66 credit hours required for the two degrees taken separately. Students take 20 credit hours in history as outlined above under course requirements for the Master of Arts degree and 30 credit hours of library sci - ence. For specific requirements, see the entry for the School of Library and Information Sciences in the Indiana University Graduate Bulletin. Admission to each of the two areas of study is approved separately on the same basis as for other appli - cants not in the dual program. Foreign Language Requirement Reading proficiency in one of the following languages: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, ancient Greek, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, or another language ap - propriate to the student's program of study, if approved by the University Graduate School. Proficiency may be demonstrated by the means indicated under the heading \"Foreign Language Requirement\" in the section on the M.A. degree. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Adm ission Requirements (1) Completion of the M.A. degree at Indiana University or another recognized institution, (2) a superior record in his - tory, (3) certification in at least one foreign language, and (4) review and approval by a field committee consisting of faculty in the student's major field. For students with an M.A. degree from Indiana University, this review must take place by the end of a student's third semester of full-time graduate study; for other students, this review is done by a subcommittee prior to admission. For those with M.A. degrees from another institu - tion, a writing sample, a personal statement and three letters of recommendation are required. Grades No grade below B- (2.7) in history courses will be counted toward this degree. Course Requirements The minimum course requirements for the Ph.D. degree are six colloquia (courses H600-H699) distributed in two or more fields, two seminars (courses H700-H799) taught by differ - ent instructors, one of which must be in the major field; H601 Introduction to the Professional Study of History during the first semester at IU; and courses to complete the outside minor. For those students transferring M.A. credits, a minimum of four colloquia and one seminar must be completed on the IU Bloomington campus. Students may take dissertation credits (H899) to fulfill the 90 credit hours required by the University Graduate School to complete the Ph.D. Students enrolled in the dual concentration program in cultural history must complete H680 and H780 in addition to the requirements listed above. Foreign Language Requirement The number and type of languages required will be determined by the student's major field of study. All students, regardless of field, must demonstrate proficiency in at least one foreign language. Several fields require students to demonstrate pro - ficiency in additional languages; students should consult their advisors or the appropriate field chair for guidance. Students may demonstrate proficiency in the following languages: Ara - bic, Chinese, French, German, ancient Greek, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, or others appropriate to the student's program of study, if approved by the University Graduate School. Proficiency may be demonstrated by the means indicated under the heading \"Foreign Language Require - ment\" in the section on the M.A. degree. Qualifying Examination (1) A rigorous oral examination of no longer than three hours will be required. The purpose of the examination is to demon - strate general command of the major and minor fields of study. The examination should assess students' scholarly preparation to teach courses in their fields through the demonstration of the ability to discuss key issues and problems in these areas. At least two representatives of the student's major field and at least one representative of his/her inside minor field must be present at the examination. The faculty representative for the student's outside minor has the option of participating or waiv - ing participation. Students enrolled in the dual concentration in a time/place field and cultural history should have at least two representatives from the time/place field and two from the cultural history field on their examination committees. (2) There will be a public defense (open to all faculty and gradu - ate students) of the student's dissertation prospectus, which the student's exam committee will preside over. The defense can take place as early as one week, but no later than six months, after the student passes the oral examination. Because the prospectus defense is meant to be an open forum, provid - ing feedback from colleagues as well as the exam commit - tee, then these defenses should normally be held during the academic year (fall and spring semesters) when the majority of faculty and students are available to participate. The prospec - tus will be distributed at least one week in advance of the defense. It should be substantial and should take the form of a grant proposal. It should explain the potential significance of the proposed dissertation project and place it in historiographi - cal context. Students must receive passing grades on both parts of the examination in order to advance to Ph.D. candidacy. The student's examination committee grades both parts of the examination. Termination of Enrollment in the Doctoral Program If a doctoral student fails the oral qualifying examination two times, falls below a 3.0 (B) grade point average, fails to meet the language requirement by the time 30 credit hours of post- M.A. credit have been earned, or fails to complete the oral qualifying examinations by the end of the approved length of time, the director of graduate studies, in consultation with the 282advisory committee, can initiate steps to terminate the stu - dent's enrollment in the program. The student, however, may make a formal appeal to be given a third chance to pass the qualifying examinations or to be given additional time to raise the grade point average or to complete the qualifying examina - tion. If the appeal is denied, the director of graduate studies will recommend to the dean of the University GraduateSchool that the student's enrollment in the doctoral program be termi - nated. Final Examination Oral defense of dissertation. Ph.D. Minor in History Students in other departments may minor in history by com - pleting, with a grade point average no lower than B (3.0), at least 12 credit hours of course work in history, including one colloquium. No more than 6 credit hours of work transferred from another university may be applied toward this require - ment, and such credit must be approved by the director of graduate studies in the Department of History. To arrange for a history minor, students should consult the director of graduate studies, who will recommend a member of the faculty to serve as an advisor. In consultation with the advi - sor, a program of study will be outlined and a copy of the plan filed with the director of graduate studies. Upon completion of the course work, the student should ask their history advisor or the director of graduate studies to attest to the successful completion of the outside minor.

The M.A. program in history on the Indianapolis campus offers three areas of concentration: United States history, European history, and public history. United States and European history are traditional areas of concentration and will serve the needs of persons intending to pursue a doctoral program, those seeking a collateral degree to complement such other fields as education or library science, and individuals seeking personal fulfillment. Public history is designed to prepare persons inter - ested in pursuing careers as historians in such settings as histor - ical societies, museums, historic preservation organizations and historic parks, governmental agencies, and business corpora - tions. With its proximity to a large number of such institutions, the Indianapolis campus is an ideal location at which to pursue a degree in public history. Special Departmental Requirements (See also general University Graduate School requirements.) Master of Arts Degree Admission Requirements 1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university, with an overall undergraduate grade point average of at least 3.0 (B) and a minimum grade point average of 3.0 (B) in the student's undergraduate major (an undergraduate major in history is not required, but applicants without such a background may be required to take additional course work in history at the undergraduate level as a condition for acceptance into the program); 2. Appropriate level of achievement on the Graduate Record Examination General Test; and 3. Three letters of recommendation. Foreign Language There is no foreign language requirement for the degree per se. However, those students who will incorporate foreign language documents in their graduate work (especially those concentrat - ing on European history) will be expected to translate non- English sources. They must thus demonstrate an appropriate level of competence in the relevant language before they begin work on their thesis. The Director of Graduate Studies and the student's advisor may require the student to take additional coursework.288All students concentrating in European history should expect to demonstrate competence in a foreign language, ideally upon application to the program. (Competence is defined as two years of undergraduate coursework with a grade of B or better in the final semester, or demonstration of an equivalent read - ing proficiency in an approved foreign language exam.) Stu - dents considering the possibility of going on for a Ph.D. should recognize that competence in at least one and sometimes two foreign languages is often a requirement in history doctoral programs. Grades No grade below B- (2.7) in history courses will be counted toward this degree. Course Requirements Students pursuing any one of the three concentration areas must take H500 or H501. Those electing United States history must take at least one graduate colloquium and one graduate seminar in United States history and at least one course in non- United States history. Students electing European history must take a graduate colloquium and seminar in that area and at least one course outside their concentration. With the consent of their faculty advisor, students may take as many as 6 credits outside the Department of History. Six (6) credits will be grant - ed upon successful completion of the required master's thesis. A total of 30 credit hours is required for students concentrating in United States and in European history. Students choosing public history as their area of concentration must take (1) H500 or H501, (2) H542, and (3) a colloquium and seminar in United States history, and (4) do an internship. Four (4) hours of credit will be granted upon satisfactory completion of the internship project. Public history students must also take at least one course outside United States history. With the con - sent of their faculty advisor, they may take as many as 6 credits outside the Department of History. Two (2) credits will be granted upon successful completion of the required master's thesis. A minimum of 36 credit hours is required for students concentrating in public history. Dual Degree: Master of Library Science and Master of Arts in History Study for these two degrees can be combined for a total of 53 credit hours rather than the 66 credit hours required for the two degrees if taken separately. Students take 23 credit hours in history, which must include History H547 (Archives), one graduate seminar and one graduate colloquium. No thesis is required for students earning an M.A. degree in history who are also earning a Master of Library Science (M.L.S.) under this dual degree program. No area of concentration is required, but students wishing to focus on public history for the M.A. in history must also include History H542 among the required 23 credits of history course work. Such students may, if they wish, do a public history internship and count a maximum of 2 credit hours of History H543 toward the degree. (Students may enroll in H543 only after having taken or while taking H542.) The remaining 30 credit hours are taken in the School of Library and Information Science (SLIS). These include 15 credit hours of M.L.S . Foundation courses, 9 credit hours of other required courses, and 6 credits of SLIS electives. See the SLIS Bulletin for details. Dual Degree: Master of Arts in History and Master of Arts in Philanthropic Studies The dual M.A. in History and M.A. in Philanthropic Studies creates a unique opportunity to pursue critical inquiry into the historical, cultural, philosophical, and economic implications of voluntary action for the public good. Historians routinely study the role of nonprofit organizations, self-help groups, and philanthropic institutions. This dual degree program offers an interdisciplinary focus on the past, present, and future. This de - gree will be attractive to students wishing to pursue (1) careers that demand the skills and talents developed by cross-training in history and philanthropy; or (2) doctoral programs that en - courage new and creative approaches to the historical study of philanthropy, broadly defined. Admission requirements for the dual degree program are identical to those for each program separately. A separate ap - plication must be made to each of the programs. Prospective students are expected to take responsibility for learning about and meeting the different admission requirements and dead - lines of each department. Students must make plans early with advisors in both programs to identify (1) common courses and (2) a thesis topic. Study for these two degrees can be combined for a total of 51 credit hours (U.S. or European history concentrations) or 54 credit hours (public history) rather than the 66 or 72 credit hours that would be required if the two degrees were taken separately. For all concentrations, the required 700-level seminar for the M.A. in history may be selected as an elective to meet the philanthropic studies requirement for one of two theoretical electives. The required history courses with philan - thropic studies topics HIST H509 (Topic: History of Philanthropy in the West) or HIST H511 (Topic: History of American Philan - thropy) may be taken to meet the history requirement for a his - tory elective. Required courses PHIL P542 Ethics and Values of Philanthropy, or PHST P512 Human and Financial Resources for Philanthropy, may be taken to meet 3 credits of the 6 credits of outside electives that may be taken in the history program. For public history students, HIST H543 Practicum meets the requirement for PHST P590 Internship for the Philanthropic Studies program. A common thesis meets the requirements of both departments. Ph.D. Minor in History Students in other departments may minor in history by com - pleting, with a grade point average no lower than B (3.0), at least 12 credit hours of course work in history. A minimum of 6 credit hours must be taken on the Indianapolis campus. This course work shall include:289 HIST H501 Historical Methodology (4 cr.)

Eighth Street, (812) 855-5798 Program Information Modern India has more than a billion citizens, nearly 16 per - cent of the world's population. India today is a reflection of millennia of interaction and exchange across a wide spectrum of cultures and civilizations. Critical contemporary intellectual, political, and social issues\u2014including security, social equality, economic and political development, and the role of historical relationships\u2014are all being debated in India, and how these issues are addressed is of vital interest to the world community. The India Studies Program at Indiana University provides for the interdisciplinary study and critical analysis of the Indian subcontinent and its peoples from ancient times to the present. The primary focus of the India Studies Program is on mod - ern India. Yet in order to understand present-day India, it is important to have basic knowledge of the great periods in its history that have shaped modern India. This approach re - quires a sophisticated understanding of the country's highly developed arts, music, literature, drama, philosophy, religions, and social and political structures. In addition to providing an overall, comprehensive education about Indian civilizations, the program allows for more specialized work in (a) literary and performance studies, (b) philosophical and religious studies, and (c) social, political, and historical studies. The India Studies Program also offers beginning- and intermediate-level courses in several Indian languages. All students in the program are en - couraged to take l anguage classes, as well as to consider study abroad in India. Ph.D. Minor in India Studies Requirements: 12 credit hours, including the core, plus ad - vanced work in one of the three disciplinary groups of the program (excluding language courses). Specific courses as well as language requirements (if any) should be chosen in consulta - tion with the director of India Studies. Ordinarily, only 3 credits from the student's major program may be counted toward the Ph.D. minor. Cooperative Programs Students in the Ph.D. minor in India Studies are encouraged to take advantage of programs in India Studies and South Asian Studies at participating institutions in the Committee on Institu - tional Cooperation (CIC). Excellent work in the social sciences is available through the University of Chicago and the University of Wisconsin\u2014Madison. 307Courses I500 Non-Western Theatre and Drama (3 cr.)

In addition, although they are not graduate degrees offered through the University Graduate School but instead professional degrees offered through the Maurer School of Law, the School offers the Master of Laws (L.L.M.), the Master of Comparative Law (M.C.L.), the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.), and the Doctor of Jurisprudence degrees. Joint degree programs include the combined M.B.A. and J.D. in Law, the combined M.P .A. or M.S.E.S. and J.D. in Law, and the combined M.L.S. and J.D. in Law. For information regarding these degrees, see the website or bulletin of the Maurer School of Law. 344Special School Requirements (See also general University Graduate School requirements.) Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Law and Social Science This program is designed to allow qualified students to pursue interdisciplinary research and problem solving in areas where law and social science overlap. The specialized Law and Democ - racy track within this degree program provides an interdisci - plinary course of study focused on the way that law structures democracy. This track allows students to learn about the role of law in new and fragile democracies through coursework and experience in the field, training in the law and the social sciences, and comparative analyses of the experience of the United States and other countries. Inquiries about the general degree or the specialized track may be addressed to the Office of International Programs of the School of Law. Joint Degree Programs The Law School offers several formal joint-degree programs that allow students to combine a law program with programs from other Indiana University schools and departments. These joint-degree programs allow students to earn a J.D. and either a master's degree or a Ph.D. in another discipline. Joint degrees decrease the time, typically by a year, that students would spend earning both degrees separately. Joint-degree programs with other disciplines may be individually designed and struc - tured to meet students' learning and career goals. Proposals for such individually designed programs should initially be submitted to the School of Law. The School of Law will coordi - nate with the other school or department to establish the joint or concurrent program. Candidates for joint-degree programs are encouraged to apply for admission to each school at the same time. However, law students can apply for admission to the other school or depart - ment before the end of the second year of law study. Students enrolled in master's programs at other schools and depart - ments should apply for admission to the Law School before the end of the first year of the master's program. Each degree has required course work. Joint degrees are awarded at the same time, and all requirements in both schools must be completed in order to receive each degree. Whether in a formal or individually structured joint-degree program, students typically spend their first year at the Law School. Thereafter, course time is divided between the Law School and the other school or department in whatever way best meets the educational objectives of the student and the program requirements. As a general rule, joint-degree programs do not require aca - demic work during the summer recess, permitting joint-degree candidates to take advantage of opportunities for internships, clerkships, and summer associate programs. Joint Degree: Master of Arts in Journalism and Doctor of Jurisprudence in the School of Law Admission Requirements Students may apply to the School of Journalism on the Bloom - ington campus at the same time they apply to the School of Law on the Bloomington Campus. Students already enrolled in School of Law may apply to the School of Journalism up to the completion of their second year of law study. Students enrolled in School of Journalism may apply to the School of Law up to the end of their first year of the master's program. Students would customarily spend the first year in the School of Law and thereafter divide the second, third and fourth years between the two units. Credit Hours The joint program would require a minimum of 79 hours in law and 30 hours in journalism, including a thesis. Curriculum Master of Arts Degree, Research and Teaching Track A total of 30 credit hours in journalism, including J500, Intro - duction to Mass Media Research; J510, Media and Society Seminar; J800, M.A. Thesis and 21 additional credit hours in journalism. Master of Arts Degree, Professional Track A total of 30 credit hours in journalism, including the core offerings of J560, Intensive Reporting, Writing, and Editing Workshop I; J560, Intensive Reporting, Writing, and Editing Workshop II; J510, Media and Society Seminar; J572, The Press and the Constitution; one visual professional skills course, two other professional skills courses, and nine additional hours of electives. School of Law Requirements Students must complete 79 credit hours in law, including all degree requirements for the J.D. Joint Degree: Master of Arts/Master of Science in Telecommunications and Doctor of Jurisprudence in the School of Law The Law School and the Department of Telecommunications offer joint Doctor of Jurisprudence\u2014Master of Arts/Master of Science degrees. Under the program, students may complete both the J.D. and the M.A. or M.S. in telecommunications in eight semesters. Interested students usually apply to the Law School and the Department of Telecommunications at the same time; how - ever, a person already enrolled in the Law School may apply for admission to the Department of Telecommunications up to the completion of the second year of law study. A student enrolled 345in telecommunications may seek admission to the School of Law up to the end of the first year of the master's program. Students customarily spend the first year in the School of Law and thereafter divide the second, third, and fourth years between the two units. Requirements for graduation are 79 credit hours in law (including all degree requirements) and 27 credit hours in telecommunications courses (including all of its required coursework) as well as a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.3 on all work taken in the School of Law and at least 3.0 on all work taken in the Telecommunications department. Ph.D. Minor in Law The School of Law offers a minor in law for Ph.D. students from other fields, which requires completion of 13-16 credit hours of course work. There are two required courses: a basic method - ological course, such as contracts, torts, property, constitution - al law, criminal law, or civil procedure; and either a research seminar (2 credits) or independent research (2 credits). Other courses to be taken will depend on the student's interests and needs and shall be recommended by the assigned faculty advisor from the School of Law and approved by the student's Ph.D. advisory committee and the appropriate chairperson or the dean of the student's school. Examinations are required for individual courses, but none is required for the minor itself. The minor chairperson in the School of Law is Assistant Dean Leonard Fromm, Room 024, (812) 855-5361.

Final Examination None. Course Requirements A total of 30 credit hours, including L520, L530, L541, L542, and L543. A grade point average of 3.0 (B) must be achieved in these five core courses. Additional electives as approved by the department. Specific course requirements may be met by 363taking a higher level course in the same area. A minimum of 20 credit hours must be from linguistics department offerings. Foreign Language Requirements Reading knowledge of one foreign language approved by the department and knowledge of the structure of a language or languages other than English and outside the student's general language family. (The L653-L654 sequence may satisfy the sec - ond part of this requirement.) Master of Arts in Linguistics with a Concentration in Computational Linguistics Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field which addresses the use of computers to process or produce human language. Linguistics contributes to this field an understanding of the special properties of language data, and also provides theories and descriptions of language structure and use. Com - putational linguistics is largely an applied discipline concerned with practical problems. Typical applications include: natural language processing, machine translation (translating from one language to another), speech synthesis, speech production, information retrieval (finding relevant documents or parts of documents in large collections of texts), cognitive modeling, and, in general, almost anything dealing with natural language interfaces. Course Requirements The master's track in computational linguistics consists of a minimum of 30 credit hours to include L541, L542, L543, L545, and L645. A grade point average of 3.0 (B) must be achieved in these five core courses. Students must also fulfill a spe - cialization course requirement by taking two of the following courses: B651 (Computer Science), Q520 (Cognitive Science), S522 (Speech and Hearing Sciences) and seminar courses such as P657 (Psychology) and L700 (Linguistics) approved by the student's academic advisor. Three additional electives must be taken. A minimum of 20 credit hours must be from linguistics department offerings. Outside electives must be approved by the student's academic advisor. Programming Language Requirement One computer programming course or the equivalent approved by the student's academic advisor. Foreign Language Requirement Reading knowledge of one foreign language approved by the department. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Admission Requirements Admission to the Ph.D. program will be based upon evalua - tion of (1) previous academic record, (2) level of achievement on the Graduate Record Examination General Test, (3) three letters of recommendation, (4) previous exposure to linguistics and related course work, and (5) compatibility of interests with those of the faculty. Fields of Study The doctorate is normally pursued in areas such as phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, historical linguistics, African linguistics, computational linguistics, applied linguistics (including second-language acquisition), and sociolinguistics. Other concentrations, including a combined degree with cogni - tive science, are also possible with the approval of the depart - ment. Course Requirements A minimum of 90 credit hours, including dissertation. Specific requirements include one graduate course each in phonetics, phonology, syntax, historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, and language acquisition, plus at least four courses in linguistics at the 600-700 levels, one of which must be L642 or L643 for students in general linguistics. Only one of these four courses may be taken outside the Department of Linguistics. L653, the first half of the field methods sequence, may not be counted if it is used in partial fulfillment of the language structure requirement. Additional course requirements may be set by the student's advisory committee. Minor The choice of a minor field should be agreed to by the stu - dent's advisory committee. The specific requirements for the minor are established by the department that grants the minor. The student is responsible for ascertaining what those require - ments are and for meeting them. Advisory Committee All students in the Ph.D. program will select an advisory com - mittee consisting of at least three faculty members, one of whom should normally represent the student's minor field. The committee must be selected no later than the end of the semester following the completion of the master's degree at Indiana University, or, in the case of students entering the program with master's degrees from other institutions, no later than two semesters after matriculation. Students will plan their programs with the advisory committee, which will be responsible for counseling students with regard to the qualifying examination, setting the examination, and administering it. Foreign Language Structure Knowledge of the structure of a language other than English and outside the student's general language family (choice to be determined in consultation with the student's advisory com - mittee). Research Tools Requirements (1) Reading or speaking knowledge of a foreign language rel - evant and applicable to doctoral study in the student's research area, and (2) proficiency in a research skill appropriate to the student's research area, including, but not limited to, reading knowledge in an additional foreign language, statistics, logic, programming, methods in social science research, and field methods. Proficiency is normally demonstrated by two semes - ters of appropriate instruction. Students may not count field methods classes for both the foreign language structure and 364research tools requirement. The choice of appropriate research tools is to be determined in consultation with the student's advisory committee. Qualifying Examination Comprehensive; the examination is on two distinct areas of lin - guistics and typically requires the student to write two papers (of publishable quality). Specific focus and scheduling of the ex - amination is determined by the student's advisory committee. Research Proposal After nomination to candidacy, the student will select a research committee composed of no fewer than three mem - bers of the Department of Linguistics faculty and an outside representative. This committee must approve the proposed dissertation topic. Final Examination Oral defense of dissertation. This defense is open.

Admission Requirements Undergraduate mathematics major or its equivalent. Area Options In order to describe the various concentration requirements, the Department of Mathematics has classified its courses into three areas: pure mathematics, applied mathematics-numerical analysis, and probability-statistics. Each of these areas is fur - ther subdivided into fields. Pure mathematics is subdivided into analysis (real and complex), algebra, topology and geometry, and logic and foundations. Applied mathematics-numerical analysis is subdivided into applied mathematics, mechanics, and numerical analysis. Probability-statistics is subdivided into probability and statistics. Students with a strong interest in Physics might consider the Ph.D. program in Mathematical Physics. Master of Arts Degree Course Requirements A total of 30 credit hours, of which 18 credit hours must be mathematics courses at the 500 to 700 level, excluding M553, M555, M556, M595, M596, and M599. The total course work submitted must include courses satisfying one of the follow - ing options and must be approved by the director of graduate studies. 1. Applied Mathematics Option. Courses including M511, M513, and at least M545, M571, M572. In addition, the student must 372take at least one 3 credit hour graduate course outside the Department of Mathematics. 2. Pure Mathematics Option. At least 6 credit hours in each of three of the following groups: algebra, analysis, applied mathematics and numerical analysis, logic and founda - tions, probability and statistics, topology and geometry, outside area (biology, psychology, computer science, eco - nomics, chemistry, physics, and others). 3. Statistics Option. M511, M563, M566, and at least two of the following: M564, M567, M568, Economics E671, or any other approved course outside the Department of Math - ematics. Master of Arts for Teachers Degree Course Requirements A total of 36 credit hours, with at least one 3 credit hour course in each of the following groups: algebra, analysis, probability and statistics, topology and geometry, applied mathematics and numerical analysis. Restrictions Only Department of Mathematics graduate courses numbered 400 or higher count toward the 20 credit hours required in the major; up to 6 credit hours of courses below 400 accepted, with consent of the director of graduate studies, in partial fulfillment of the remaining 16 credit hours. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Course Requirements The following course requirements are designed to provide the broad background needed for the successful pursuit of research leading to the dissertation. Students must complete 36 credit hours in mathematics at the 500, 600, or 700 level, excluding M553, M555, M556, M595-M596 and M599, and, in addition, must complete 2 credit hours in M599. Their program of study will depend upon their background and interests. Students should formulate a program in consultation with their faculty advisor. The total course work submitted for the degree must satisfy one of the options below. Reading courses may not be used to satisfy the requirements of these options unless they are specifically approved by the graduate director. A dis - sertation is required. 1. Applied Mathematics Option. Students must complete M511-M512, M513, and M540-M541. Students must also complete either 6 credit hours of graduate credit outside the Department of Mathematics in an area conducive to mathematical treatment and approved by the student's advisor, or 12 credit hours of graduate credit that is cross- listed with the Department of Physics. In addition, students must complete 6 credit hours of graduate credit in each of two of the following groups: a. Algebra, and logic and foundations b. Topology and geometry c. Numerical analysis, probability, and statistics 2. Pure Mathematics Option. Students must complete 6 credit hours of graduate credit in five of the following groups, including 6 credit hours of 500-level courses in two of groups 1-4, and 6 credit hours of 500-level courses in another of groups 1-6. a. Analysis b. Algebra c. Topology and geometry d. Logic and foundations e. Probability and statistics f. Applied mathematics and numerical analysis g. Outside and miscellaneous courses (cryptography, quantum computing, financial mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics are commonly used, but others may also be appropriate). Any courses in this category must be approved by your advisor and the director of graduate studies. 3. Statistics Option. Each student's program should be ar - ranged to include work in mathematics, mathematical statistics, probability, and the application of statistics to some particular field. Students must complete 6 hours of graduate credit in other departments in courses approved by their advisor, as well as M511-M512, M563-M564, M566-M567, and 6 hours of graduate credit in each of two of the following groups: a. Applied mathematics and numerical analysis b. Algebra c. Complex analysis d. Topology and geometry e. Computer science Minor You must complete a minor in mathematics, or in some other department. If you choose to minor in another department, you must satisfy that department's requirements as described in the University Graduate School Bulletin and have that department notify the Department of Mathematics Graduate Office that you have done so. To complete a minor in mathematics itself, there are two pos - sible options: 1. Nine credit hour minor. This requires 9 credit hours of course work at the 500-700 level in an area (Pure Math - ematics, Applied Mathematics, or Probability and Statis - tics) different from that of the dissertation. This area then becomes the \"area for minor\" while forming the Research Committee (see below). 2. Twelve credit hour minor. This requires 6 credit hours of course work at the 500-700 level in each of two fields (Analysis, Algebra, Topology and Geometry, Logic and Foundations, Applied Mathematics [Differential Equations], Mathematical Physics, Numerical Analysis, Probability, Sta - tistics) other than that of the dissertation. One of the fields chosen must be in an area (Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Probability and Statistics) other than that of the dissertation. Any of these two fields can be chosen as the \"minor field\" while forming the Research Committee (see below). In addition, reading courses (e.g., M800) and courses taken at the other universities will not satisfy the 373course requirements for the Ph.D. minor. Foreign Language Requirement Reading proficiency in one foreign language in which major research articles in mathematics are published. Acceptable lan - guages are German, French, and Russian or another language deemed to be more relevant by the dissertation advisor. The Graduate Policy Committee of the Department of Mathematics will consider petitions for substituting other languages. Qualifying Examinations The Department of Mathematics qualifying exam comprises a three-tier system designed to help determine as quickly and efficiently as possible whether students have mastered basic graduate-level mathematics, exhibit the necessary abilities and self-discipline, and have prepared themselves to pursue the independent research necessary for the Ph.D. within a two- to three-year time frame. Tier 1 (Comprehensive 400-Level Written Exams) Ph.D. students will take a two-part written exam on 400-level algebra and analysis. The exams will be given during the week before classes begin in the fall and in the spring. New students may take either or both of the Tier 1 exams in August when they first arrive. A student is allowed to try each exam each time it is offered, but he/she must pass both exams prior to the end of the second year of study. Syllabi, references, and sample problems for these exams are available in the Department of Mathematics graduate office. Tier 2 (Committee Review) Each May, a departmental committee will review the record of every student who has either: a. Completed two years in the program without previous review, or b. Passed the Tier 1 exams on entrance to the program and elects the review at the end of the first year. The review committee will decide which students may continue toward Ph.D. candidacy. The committee's considerations will include: a. Performance on the Tier 1 exams. b. Performance in 500-level course work. c. A report from the student's academic advisor (see below). d. Written personal statement by student. e. Student's performance of assistantship duties. As indicated above, students can accelerate their progress in the program by passing the Tier 1 exams on entrance into the program and electing the Tier 2 review at the end of their first year. The review committee will treat this as favorable for a student's case. Students who do not get a recommendation to continue will be encouraged to complete the M.A. degree. If they have financial support at the time of review, they will be entitled to at least one additional semester of support in order to do so. Tier 3 (Oral Exam) After the Tier 2 review, students must arrange and pass a Qualifying Oral Exam before October of their fourth year. The student will seek the direction of a faculty member as a scientific advisor a \"tentative Ph.D. advisor\" for this exam. The faculty member will assign a reading list consisting of texts and research-level papers; this material will comprise the major topic of the exam. The student will also propose a minor area, to be approved by the director of graduate studies. If and when the scientific advisor feels the student is ready for the exam, the advisor will arrange for a three-member faculty commit - tee to administer the exam. These exams are projected to last approximately two hours, and one of the committee members must be qualified to examine the student in the minor area, where the student must demonstrate 500-level mastery. In order to pass the exam, the student must: a. Demonstrate a level of mathematical ability and maturity sufficient for successfully undertaking a Ph.D. dissertation (normally in the major area of the exam), and b. Identify a faculty member willing to serve as Ph.D. advisor. This will typically, but not necessarily, be the faculty mem - ber who organized the exam. Two aspects of the graduate program that directly support this three-tiered system bear mention: 1. A faculty advisor will be assigned to every entering stu - dent. The advisor will be expected to follow the student's progress in both course work and instructional duties, and to write a short report for the Tier 2 review committee at the appropriate time. 2. Grades in 500-level courses will be given and evaluated according to the following guidelines: a. A grade of A means that, based on the student's work in that course, the instructor believes the student will suc - ceed in being admitted to Ph.D. candidacy. b. A grade of B means that the student's work in that course is satisfactory, but the instructor has reservations (based on that work) about the student's ability to be admitted to candidacy. All students must maintain at least a B average in their 500-lev - el course work, in accordance with currently published depart - mental and university guidelines. Tier 1 exams are administered at the end of the week before classes begin in August and January, and will be allotted at least four hours (the intention is that time should not be a serious constraint). Ph.D. Minor in Mathematics Doctoral students in other departments may complete a minor in mathematics by satisfying one of the following options: (1) 9 credit hours of mathematics courses at the 400 level or above, or (2) M343-M344 and 6 credit hours of mathematics courses at the 400 level or above. Reading courses (e.g., M800) and courses taken at other universities will not satisfy the course requirements for the Ph.D. minor. 374Courses Students are advised to begin their study of a field with 400-level courses, unless their preparation in that field has been very good. M.A.T. students in mathematics, or M.A., M.S., or Ph.D. students in other departments, may receive graduate credit for any 400-level course that appears in this bulletin. Candidates for the M.A. or Ph.D. in mathematics should note that some 400-level courses do not satisfy certain degree re - quirements (see footnotes).

It encompasses the scholarly explora - tion of museums, including their history, operations, ethics and role in society from interdisciplinary perspectives, while also training students in the technical aspects of museum work such as collections care and management, administration, educa - tion, exhibit planning and design, curatorial practices, visitor studies and technology. As an urban university, IUPUI is part of a community with a rich heritage of museums and cultural arts. Faculty appointed as Public Scholars of Civic Engagement craft relationships and sustainable partnerships with area museums and cultural in - stitutions and involve undergraduate and graduate students in meaningful ways in those collaborations. The Museum Studies Program has an extensive network of adjunct faculty and guest lecturers who bring state-of-the-art museum practice to the curriculum. The program also offers extensive opportunities for student learning through the resources of the museum com - munity with experiences such as internships; collaboration on exhibit development and design; exhibition- and collections-fo - cused courses; access to collections; collaboration with faculty on museum research projects; and participation in museum- sponsored seminars, lectures, and professional meetings. The integral role of Indianapolis museums in the Museum Studies curriculum fosters a critical, reflective, and scholarly discourse on museums that is applied to current practices and issues in the field. The program offers a master's degree and both an under - graduate and a graduate certificate. Students considering application to the certificate or degree program are welcome in the classes. Up to 9 credits earned as a graduate nondegree student may be applied toward the certificate or degree upon admission to the program. Please see the Web site for admis - sions deadlines and current course offerings. Graduate Certificate in Museum Studies The Graduate Certificate in Museum Studies provides stu - dents with interdisciplinary training in museum practice and a knowledge of contemporary issues in the museum field. It trains students in specialized aspects of museum practice such as education, exhibit planning and design, collections care, curatorial practices, philanthropy, and nonprofit management by combining Museum Studies course work with curriculum in other IU schools (e.g., Public History, Philanthropic Studies, 398Education, Library Science). Students are given an introduction to the history and philosophy of museums and an opportunity to focus on particular aspects of museum practice. The Graduate Certificate may be taken as a freestanding credential or paired with graduate work in another related discipline. Because it offers an opportunity to focus on specific areas of museum practice, the graduate certificate is also a suitable credential for current museum professionals who wish to enhance their professional training or develop new special - ties. For specific requirements and options for cross-listed courses, see the Museum Studies web site or meet with an academic advisor. Master's Degree The Museum Studies M.A. curriculum (36 credit hours) consists of a required introductory course, a set of integrated core courses which provide a broad-based interdisciplinary training in museum practice, and a choice of elective courses that allow the student to develop a particular specialty. The course work is complemented by an internship that provides an opportunity for an intensive applied learning experience in a museum. The interdisciplinary curriculum and flexible structure allow stu - dents to achieve either a generalist breadth suitable for those working in smaller museums or to focus on a particular area of museum practice appropriate for a specialist on the staff of a larger museum. Team-based and applied projects form a core learning experi - ence in all classes and present opportunities to work with com - munity partners as well as peers in the program. Team proj - ects such as exhibit development and visitor studies prepare students for the collaborative approach that is central to the museum field. Course Requirements The Museum Studies Graduate Certificate consists of 18 credit hours of course work, including a required introductory course (3 cr.), an internship (3 cr.), two core courses (6 cr.), and a choice of two additional courses (6 cr.) from a list of museum studies courses. The master's degree program consists of 36 credit hours of course work, including a required introductory course (3 cr.), four core courses (12 cr.), an internship (6 cr.), a colloquium (3 cr.), and a choice of four courses from the elec - tives (12 cr.) All these courses must be passed with a grade of B- or above in order to count for the certificate or the degree. Internships must be approved by a faculty advisor prior to registration. Note: the requirements for the master's degree were revised in May 2007. Students admitted to the program prior to August 2007 may complete their degree following either the old or new requirements and should meet with their academic advi - sor to discuss their options. All students should file a curricu - lum plan with the Museum Studies office before the end of their first semester.Graduate Certificate requirements (18 cr.)

The field addresses volun - tary contributions of time and money, voluntary associations, and what has been called \"the social history of the moral imagi - nation.\" Areas of inquiry range from the history of philanthropy and philanthropy in literature to nonprofit management and legal issues. Undergraduate and graduate programs in various areas of philanthropic studies are available in the University Graduate School, the School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI, the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, and other schools at IUPUI and IU Bloomington. New courses and degree programs develop rapidly. For up- to-date information, please contact the Philanthropic Studies Program (www.philanthropy.iupui.edu).430Degrees Offered Master of Arts and Doctorate of Philosophy. Special Departmental Requirements (See also general University Graduate School requirements.) Master of Arts Degree The M aster of Arts in Philanthropic Studies focuses on the history, culture, and values of philanthropy. Its objectives are to enable students to gain the knowledge and skills either to pursue further graduate study in relevant fields or to pursue careers in the independent sector or in related fields; to en - able students to investigate the broader theoretical issues of philanthropy and of their chosen areas of specialization from a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives; and to utilize the interdisciplinary base to maintain a thoroughgoing critical inquiry into the historical and cultural implications of philanthropy. Admission Requirements Requirements include a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university, a minimum 3.0 grade point average on a scale of 4.0, and a minimum 3.0 average in the student's major field. In addition, students seeking admission to the program should demonstrate an appropriate level of achievement on the Graduate Record Examination (or comparable proficiency test) and must arrange for three letters of recommendation that speak to the applicant's academic and personal qualifica - tions to be addressed to the M.A. program Admissions Commit - tee. Applicants who do not meet all of the requirements listed above may be admitted to the program on a provisional basis, in which case their status will be reviewed after a fixed period of time to determine whether they may continue in the pro - gram. Financial Aid Several scholarships and research assistantships are available. Please contact the Philanthropic Studies Program for more information (www.philanthropy.iupui.edu). Course Requirements The M.A. in philanthropic studies requires a total of 36 credit hours: 21 required, 6 in electives, 6 more for a thesis or courses in lieu of thesis (at least one of which has to involve significant research), and 3 for a directed philanthropic studies intern - ship. A minimum of 18 credit hours in core and elective courses combined must be in the School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI, and not more than 9 credit hours may be taken in courses num - bered below 500. These 9 credits may come only from courses approved for University Graduate School credit. In addition, for the nonthesis option, at least one of the courses must have a major research component. The approval process for the thesis or its alternative will normally take place after a student has successfully completed 15 credits of course work. In order to earn the M.A. in philanthropic studies, students must maintain a 3.0 grade average on a scale of 4.0. Grades in courses counting for credit toward this degree may be no lower than C (2.0 on a scale of 4.0). The 18 credits of core courses normally include History H509 Special Topics in European History (Topic: History of Philan - thropy in the West) or History H516 History of Philanthropy in the United States, Philosophy P542 The Ethics and Values of Philanthropy, Philanthropic Studies P512 Human and Financial Resources for Philanthropy, Philanthropic Studies P521 The Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector, Philanthropic Studies P523 Civil Society and Philanthropy, and Philanthropic Studies P590 Internship in Philanthropic Studies. In addition, students will take either Economics E514 The Nonprofit Economy and Public Policy or Philanthropic Studies P535 The Law of Nonprofit Or - ganizations, and one comparative Philanthropy course to be se - lected from the following or other approved courses: Religious Studies R590 Religion and Philanthropy, Philanthropic Studies P530 Cross-Cultural Dimensions of Giving, and SPEA V524 Civil Society in Comparative Perspective. Master of Arts Degree in Philanthropic Studies: Executive Format Many students interested in the M.A. program are unable to at - tend on a traditional residential basis because of their distance from Indianapolis and ongoing job responsibilities. A participant in the executive format master's program can fin - ish the requirements for the degree by completing: seven intense one-week residential classes or regularly scheduled classes at IUPUI; distance education and directed off-site course work; and elective study at a qualified institution. Each summer course requires one week of intense on-campus study and is preceded by a pre-residential period of approxi - mately six weeks in length which includes preparatory reading and assignments. Each session is followed by a post-residential period which includes evaluative experiences to be completed at home. During both the pre-residential and post-residential periods, faculty work with students by using the web, e-mail, fax, telephone, and postal service. Degree requirements for the executive M.A. program are es - sentially the same as the requirements for the residential M.A. in philanthropic studies. However, instead of Philanthropic Studies P523, students must take Philanthropic Studies P535 The Law of Nonprofit Organizations and Economics E514 The Nonprofit Economic and Public Policy. Applicants for the executive program must meet the same ad - mission criteria as those applying for the residential program, with the addition of three to five years of work experience in the nonprofit sector being required in lieu of the GRE require - ment. Deadline dates for admission are January 15 for non-U.S. citizens and February 1 for U.S. citizens. 431For more information, contact the Center on Philanthropy, (317) 274-4200 or www.philanthropy.iupui.edu . Dual Degree Programs Dual Degree Master of Arts in Philanthropic Studies and Master of Arts in Economics The dual master's degree in philanthropic studies and econom - ics substantially benefits students intending to pursue a career in independent research, academia, or practice. Normally, those pursuing a career in research or academia continue in a Ph.D. program in economics, finance, accounting, manage - ment, marketing, or public policy. Very few doctoral programs include substantial content on philanthropy or nonprofit organizations. As such, the M.A. in philanthropic studies provides a broad interdisciplinary background that makes the future researcher sensitive to the institutional details, values, and history of the sector, thus leading to better research. For the future nonprofit manager or leader, economics provides the principles and methodologies to make informed decisions on the appreciative level, the policy level, and the managerial level. Admission requirements for the dual degree program are iden - tical to those for each program separately. Separate applica - tion must be made to each of the two programs. Students are expected to take responsibility for learning about and meeting the admission requirements of each school individually, which may differ from each other in application documents required, minimal standards of criteria for admission, and deadline dates. Students must make plans early with advisors in both programs to identify (1) common courses and (2) thesis credit. Study for the two degrees can be combined for a total of 51 credit hours rather than the 66 credit hours that would be re - quired if the two degrees were taken separately. Two of the re - quired core courses for the M.A. in economics may be selected as electives to meet the philanthropic studies requirement for two applied electives. One of the required philanthropic studies courses, Economics E514 The Nonprofit Economy and Public Policy, may be taken to meet 3 of the 12 credit hours of electives required in the economics program. A common thesis meets the requirements of both departments. Further information regarding regulations governing advanced degree programs may be obtained from the respective depart - ments. Dual Degree Master of Arts in Philanthropic Studies and Master of Arts in History The dual M.A. in history and philanthropic studies creates a unique opportunity to pursue critical inquiry into the historical, cultural, philosophical, and economic implications of voluntary action for the public good. Historians routinely study the role of nonprofit organizations, self-help groups, and philanthropic in - stitutions. This dual-degree program offers an interdisciplinary focus on the past, present, and future. This degree will be at - tractive to students wishing to pursue (1) careers that demand the skills and talents developed by cross-training in history and philanthropy or (2) doctoral programs that encourage new and creative approaches to the historical study of philanthropy, broadly defined. Admission requirements for the dual degree program are identical to those for each program separately. A separate ap - plication must be made to each of the programs. Prospective students are expected to take responsibility for learning about and meeting the different admission requirements and dead - lines of each department. Students must make plans early with advisors in both programs to identify common courses and a thesis topic. Study for these two degrees can be combined for a total of 51 credit hours (U.S. or European history concentrations) or 54 credit hours (public history) rather than the 66 or 72 credit hours that would be required if the two degrees were taken separately. For all concentrations, the required 700-level seminar for the M.A. in history may be selected as an elec - tive to meet the philanthropic studies requirement for one of two electives. The required philanthropic studies course H509 History of Philanthropy in the West or H511 History of Philan - thropy in the United States may be taken to meet the history requirement for a history elective. Required courses Philosophy P542 Ethics and Values of Philanthropy or PHST P512 Human and Financial Resources for Philanthropy, may be taken to meet 3 of the 6 credits of outside electives that may be taken in the history program. For public history students, History H543 Practicum meets the requirement for PHST P590 Internship for the philanthropic studies program. A common thesis meets the requirements of both departments. Further information regarding regulations governing advanced degree programs may be obtained from the respective depart - ments. Dual Degree Master of Arts in Philanthropic Studies and Master of Science in Nursing While the M.S.N. with a major in nursing administration provides an essential background for the nurse executive, the addition of the M.A. in philanthropic studies adds an apprecia - tion of the philanthropic tradition and the skills to become accomplished developmental officers. Admission requirements for the combined degree program are identical to those for each program separately. Separate ap - plication must be made to each of the two programs. Students are expected to take responsibility for learning about and meeting the admission requirements of each school individu - ally, which may differ from each other in application docu - ments required, minimal standards of criteria for admission, and deadline dates. Applicants should apply for the combined degree option before completing 21 credit hours in the M.S.N. in Nursing Administration Program and before completing the core requirements or 18 credit hours of the M.A. in philan -432thropic studies. Students must make plans early with advisors in both programs to identify (1) common courses and (2) thesis credit. Study for the two degrees can be combined for a total of 60 credit hours rather than the 78 credit hours that would be required if the two degrees were taken separately. Two of the required courses for the M.S.N. are used as electives to meet the Philanthropic Studies Program requirement of two elec - tives. The P590 Internship required for the M.A. will meet the administrative practicum requirement for the M.S.N. The M.A. thesis or approved doctoral-level courses, plus one additional approved course, fulfill the required M.S.N. focus concentra - tion. Students can choose between Nursing L671 or Philan - thropic Studies P512, and Economics E514 in the M.A. program may be taken to meet the SPEA H514 requirement in the M.S.N. program. Further information regarding regulations governing advanced degree programs may be obtained from the respective depart - ments. Dual Degree Master of Arts in Philanthropic Studies and Master of Public Affairs in Nonprofit Management The continual blurring of sectors and the call for government devolution demand that advanced education for public manag - ers must address critical issues associated with the relation - ship between and the functions of nonprofit and government agencies. The combined degree in public affairs in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA) and in the Philan - thropic Studies Program provides an education with breadth and depth. Students in this combined degree program have the opportunity to pursue critical inquiry into the \"how\" and the \"why\" of nonprofit management and philanthropy. As a result they are better prepared to be scholars and reflective practitio - ners. Admission requirements for the combined degree program are identical to those for each program separately. Separate application must be made to each of the two programs, and students should take responsibility to learn about and meet the admission requirements of each school individually, which may differ from each other in application documents required, minimal standards of criteria for admission, and deadline dates. Applicants should apply for the combined degree option before completing the core requirements or 36 credit hours of the M.P .A. with a nonprofit management concentration and before completing the core requirements or 18 credit hours of the M.A. in philanthropic studies. Students must make plans early with advisors in both programs to identify (1) common courses and (2) thesis credit. Study for the two degrees can be combined for a total of 60 credit hours (rather than the 84 credit hours that would be re - quired if the two degrees were taken separately). The dual de - gree curriculum requires 21 credit hours in SPEA core courses and 12 credit hours in Philanthropic Studies core courses. In ad -dition, students must take either SPEA V521 or PHST P521 (The Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector), SPEA V522 (Human Resource Management in Nonprofit Organizations), three nonprofit application courses, a comparative elective in Philanthropic Studies, an additional elective approved by their advisor, and a directed Philanthropic Studies internship. Students may fulfill their philanthropic studies thesis requirement with their SPEA capstone, but must then take another Philanthropic Studies elective, approved by their advisor. Further information regarding regulations governing advanced degree programs may be obtained from the respective depart - ments. Ph.D. in Philanthropic Studies This program is designed to prepare future scholars and leaders in the world of philanthropy, higher education, and nonprofit organizations. It is intended for students who are seeking a traditional doctoral degree, not a professional degree. The Ph.D. will prepare students for academic positions as well as for research and leadership positions in a wide variety of nonprofit organizations. Before admission to the Ph.D. program, students must com - plete a master's degree in philanthropic studies or at least 30 credits of equivalent graduate course work. Equivalent work will be determined by the Admissions Committee, subject to applicable Indiana University rules. Examples include courses in nonprofit management, civil society, philanthropic history, eth - ics, religion, philanthropy, public administration, and business. The minimum requirements for the Ph.D. in philanthropic stud - ies are 90 credit hours of advanced study, of which 30 credit hours may be transferred from a master's degree or equivalent program that has covered the concepts of philanthropic studies as described in Indiana University's M.A. in Philanthropic Stud - ies Program. The credit hours for the Ph.D. include the follow - ing categories: 12 credit hours of required Philanthropic Studies doctoral courses, 12 credit hours in a minor field, 9 credit hours of research methods, and 6 credit hours of electives. The remaining 21 credit hours are to be used as dissertation research credit taken in additional coursework that supports the dissertation research. Ph.D. Minor in Philanthropic Studies Ph.D. students in other departments may, with the consent of their committee, minor in philanthropic studies. The minor will enable the student to take an organized body of courses focus - ing on the history, culture, and values of philanthropy, defined broadly as \"voluntary action for the public good.\" The minor requires 12 credit hours of course work to be taken from an approved list of courses, including either SPEA V521 or PHST P521 (The Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector), and passed with a grade of B (3.0) or higher in each course. With written approval from the Director of Graduate Programs in Philanthropic Studies, courses other than those listed may be 433accepted to fulfill degree requirements. No more than 6 credit hours of course work may be transferred from another univer - sity and applied toward this requirement, and such credit must be approved by the Director of Graduate Programs. Students must also successfully pass a question on Philanthropic Studies in their qualifying exams or equivalent tests required by their departments. To arrange for a Philanthropic Studies minor, students should contact the Director of Graduate Programs in Philanthropic Studies, who will also recommend a member of the Philan - thropic Studies faculty to serve as a minor field advisor. Courses P501-P502 The Philanthropic Tradition I-II (3-3 cr.) These in - terdisciplinary courses will examine the core values of philan - thropy and the principal patterns of philanthropic behavior and organization with particular emphasis on the Western tradition and the American adaptation of it. Permission of the instructor required. P512 Human and Financial Resources for Philanthropy (3 cr.) This course is designed to familiarize beginning graduate stu - dents with the three major areas subsumed under resources of the independent sector: volunteers, grantmaking, and financial resources obtained through a fundraising program. The course will be divided into four parts to include the theoretical frame - work for the sector; government, corporate, and foundation resources; charitable donations by individuals; and volunteer management. P521 The Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector (3 cr.) The theory, size, scope and functions of the nonprofit and voluntary sector are covered from multiple disciplinary perspectives including historical, political, economic and social. Same as SPEA V521. P523 Civil Society and Philanthropy (3 cr.) The course explores the relationship of civil society to the state, how the nonprofit sector affects the state and how the state regulates the sector. A continuing theme will be how and whether the state and philanthropic institutions make investments in strengthening civil society. P530 Topics in Philanthropic Studies (3 cr.) In-depth study of selected topics and issues in philanthropic studies. Specific top - ics vary from semester to semester. Course may be repeated once for credit, provided that the topic is different.

Admission Applicants must take the Graduate Record Examination General Test. Those who have an inadequate background in philosophy may, with the approval of their faculty advisor, enroll in P590 for supplemental work, provided that the number of gradu - ate credits so acquired does not exceed 9 credit hours. Upon admission, a graduate major in philosophy will be assigned a departmental faculty advisor who, in conjunction with the di - rector of graduate studies, will help plan the student's program of study. Master of Arts Degree Course Requirements A total of 30 credit hours, at least 20 credit hours of which must be in philosophy. These must include at least one course in each of four subject areas: history of philosophy, metaphys - ics and epistemology, logic, and value theory. Grades A minimum grade of B (3.0) is required in each course that counts toward the degree. Language/Thesis Requirements The student must either demonstrate reading proficiency in classical Greek, French, German, or Latin; or write an accept - able thesis. Up to 6 hours of thesis credit may be applied to the course requirements and may be counted in the 20 credit hours of philosophy. 436Doctor of Philosophy Degree Course Requirements A total of 90 credit hours, including dissertation (minimum of 30 credit hours). Grades A minimum grade point average of 3.0 (B) is required of work that counts toward the degree. Foreign Language Requirement There is no general foreign language requirement for the Ph.D. However, a student's Qualifying Committee or Dissertation Committee may require the student to achieve proficiency in a foreign language relevant to the student's research and may set the level of proficiency to be attained and the means of establishing that the required level has been attained. A stu - dent should consult with the director of graduate studies about whether he or she will need competence in a foreign language, and this consultation should begin in the student's first year, to allow adequate time for the student to develop competence. Distribution and Concentration Requirements The distribution requirements can be satisfied by taking four courses in metaphysics, epistemology, and logic; two courses in value theory; and three courses in the history of philosophy. Generally, concentration requirements can be satisfied by tak - ing a total of four courses in one of these areas. Specific course choices must be approved by the student's graduate advisory committee. Distribution requirements are normally satisfied by the end of the student's second year and concentration re - quirements by the end of the third year. Students who are tak - ing extensive course work (18 credit hours or more) in another department outside of philosophy can apply for exemption from two of the nine distribution units. Qualifying Exam An essay, together with an oral exam, on a topic that the stu - dent plans to pursue further in the dissertation. The qualifying exam will test whether the student is ready to write a dis - sertation on the chosen topic. Students who have passed the qualifying exam and have satisfied the course and language requirements are ready to be nominated for candidacy. The qualifying exam should normally be taken by the end of three- and-one-half years of graduate study. Students who have not been admitted to candidacy by the beginning of their sixth year will be dropped from the program. Ph.D. students in Philosophy may use the Qualifying Exam essay also to satisfy the Lan - guage/Thesis requirement for the M.A. degree (above) if they enroll in 3-6 hours of P590 or P803 during which the essay for the Qualifying Exam is written. Dissertation Prospectus A one- or two-page plan of the proposed dissertation that is submitted to the graduate school after it has been approved by the dissertation committee. Dissertation Chapter Exam A long essay (about 25 pages long) on the dissertation topic, with an optional oral component. The dissertation chapter exam should be taken within one year of passing the qualifying exam. Ph.D. Minor in Philosophy Doctoral students outside the department may minor in philosophy by completing 12 credit hours of graduate-level philosophy courses with a B (3.0) average or higher. No more than 9 credit hours may be taken as P590, and no more than 6 credit hours may be transfer credit hours originally earned at other universities.

Admission Requirements Satisfactory scores on the Graduate Record Examination (verbal and quantitative sections); satisfactory previous academic record; three letters of recommendation; writing sample. Inter - national students must complete the TOFEL with a satisfactory score. Applicants holding no academic degree higher than the bachelor's degree may be admitted as Ph.D. students. Master of Arts Degree Course Requirements A total of 30 credit hours, including Y570. At least 15 of the 30 credit hours must be in graduate courses (500 level or higher). Each graduate student must complete five graduate seminars in political science, averaging at least a grade of B (3.0) in all seminars, to qualify for the M.A. degree. (For students entering with previous graduate work, the director of graduate studies, with the recommendation of the student's M.A. committee, can reduce the number of required seminars based on the prior graduate training.) Essay Required. The essay may be based on a research paper pre - pared in a departmental seminar. If a new paper is written and presented as a thesis, it may receive no more than 4 hours of credit. The essay must be presented to all members of the examining committee, prior to the examination, for approval. Foreign Language/Research-Skill Requirement450The student must demonstrate reading proficiency in one foreign language or proficiency in an approved research skill. Students specializing in public policy must use an approved research skill, not a foreign language, to meet this requirement. Other Provision Work taken to meet the requirements of such programs as the area certificate of the Russian and East European Institute may be applied toward the M.A. degree. Final Examination An oral examination for the M.A. degree may be conducted by a faculty committee and will cover both the student's course of study and required essay. Master of Arts for Teachers Degree Information regarding this degree program may be obtained from the School of Education. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Course Requirements A total of 90 credit hours, including dissertation. Y570 Intro - duction to the Study of Politics is to be taken in the first year of residence. Students who select a field with an approaches- and-issues seminar should take the seminar during the first two years of residence. Each graduate student must complete 10 graduate seminars numbered 500 and above in political science (excluding directed reading and directed research courses), averaging at least a B (3.0) in all seminars, prior to nomination to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. (For students entering with previous graduate work, the director of graduate studies, with the recommendation of the student's advisory committee, can reduce the number of required seminars based on the prior graduate training.) A substantial research paper is required at the end of a student's second year. This paper should represent original research performed by the student. The advisory com - mittee will evaluate whether the student's paper is adequate for purposes of this requirement. Fields of Study The student will select two fields in political science from the following: American politics; international relations; compara - tive politics; public policy; political philosophy; theory and methodology. In exceptional cases, with the written approval of the director of graduate studies, the student may offer as one of the fields a course of study that cuts across two of the established fields. Minors The outside minor requirement is typically satisfied by com - pleting four courses in one or more related departments or in an interdepartmental program, embracing either substantive material or methodology. Some departments or other pro - grams have specific requirements for a Ph.D. minor; students should check with the relevant unit for details. Students select - ing an \"eclectic\" minor must have the proposed set of courses approved by the advisory committee, the director of graduate studies, and the graduate school. Advisory Committee Each student will be assigned an advisory committee, which will include two faculty members from each of the student's two fields in political science and a representative of the out - side minor. (Students choosing an eclectic minor need not have a representative of that minor.) The chairperson of the commit - tee serves as the student's principal advisor. The committee will supervise the student's course of study. Early in the student's residence, but in no case later than the third semester of study, the advisory committee will provide the student with a formal review of progress toward the degree. Foreign Language/Research-Skill Requirement The student must demonstrate proficiency in any two of the following: a foreign language, mathematics, logic, statistics, or computer science. With the approval of the advisory commit - tee, the student may qualify in a single language or research skill at an advanced level, rather than in two. To qualify in a language at the advanced level, the student must satisfy the in- depth proficiency requirement. For rules regarding qualification in a research skill at the advanced level, consult the director of graduate studies. The student is expected to make satisfactory progress in meeting the requirements for the degree; in par - ticular, the student must satisfy the first language or research- skill requirement during the first year of study and the second requirement no later than the second year. Qualifying Examination Students must take qualifying examinations in each of their two fields of study in political science. The qualifying field examina - tion is intended to evaluate the student's substantive knowl - edge and analytical ability in both of the student's fields of study. The written qualifying examination is administered two times a year: in the fall and spring. Research Committee Upon completion of the qualifying examination and presenta - tion of a satisfactory dissertation proposal, the student will be nominated to candidacy for the Ph.D. The University Graduate School, on the recommendation of the department, will ap - point a research committee to supervise the dissertation.

Professors Jason Newman*, Anne Prieto*, Robert Rydell*, Chen Yu * Special Departmental Requirements (See also general University Graduate School requirements.) Admission Requirements Recommended Undergraduate Background: To prepare for graduate work in psychological and brain sciences at Indiana University, students should have a general background in psy - chology consisting of approximately 20 credit hours in psychol - ogy, including laboratory work in psychology and statistics. Undergraduate course work in mathematics and in the biologi - cal and/or physical sciences is desirable. While it is expected that students will have a substantial background in psychology, students with backgrounds in other areas, for example, biology or mathematics, will be considered for admission on an equal basis with those students who have majored in psychology. Grades An average of at least a B+ (3.3) must be maintained in all course work. No grades below B- (2.7) may be counted toward degree requirements. Students with a GPA below 3.3 or receiv459ing more than one grade below B- (2.7) may be subject to academic probation and dismissal. Master of Arts Degree Normally the department accepts only Ph.D. students, but under unusual circumstances, applicants are considered for a M.A. degree only. Students accepted for a M.A. normally are not provided with financial support by the department. Students completing the M.A. program are not ensured accep - tance into the Ph.D. program and will be evaluated in compari - son with all other applicants to the Ph.D. program. No training program in clinical psychology is offered at the master's level. Course Requirements A total of 30 credit hours including a core consisting of P553 and P595, and one graduate course in four areas of specializa - tion in the department. A GPA of at least 3.3 must be main - tained (see general department guidelines for grades above). Masters Thesis Required. Students must be consistently involved in productive research throughout their course of graduate study. Students who are determined, by their faculty advisory committee, not to be making adequate research progress may be subject to academic probation and dismissal. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Research To remain in good standing, students must be consistently involved in productive research throughout their course of graduate study. Students are judged on research potential and productivity, as well as on course work. All students are ex - pected to develop research skills appropriate to their programs through a combination of course work, individual study, and experience. One substantial research project must be complet - ed and formally approved by the student's advisory commit - tee before the end of the third semester. A second substantial research project must be completed and approved by the end of the fifth semester. Student research progress will be evalu - ated annually by the student's advisory and research commit - tees, which will examine progress on first and second research projects, the dissertation research project, and involvement in other research projects. Students who fail to make adequate research progress at any point may be subject to academic probation and dismissal. Course Requirements A total of 90 credit hours, including dissertation. Students must complete the department core courses: P553, P554, P595, and P660. Also required are course selections from the student's area of specialization, usually consisting of approximately 12 credit hours from a selection of core courses in a student's ma - jor area of study. Unless pursuing a double major, the student is also required to complete a minor. In addition, students are expected to complete one graduate course in two areas outside the student's specialization and minor areas (or outside both majors, in the case of a double major). Up to two additional courses may be specified by the student's advisory committee at any time before the Qualifying Exam has been successfully passed. In addition, students completing the APA approved Program in Clinical Psychology must complete two clinical elective cours - es, at least 6 hours of P690 (practicum training), a one-year internship approved by the clinical science program, and must demonstrate competence in APA specified areas of broad and general training in psychology. Failure to complete required courses within a timeframe speci - fied by the student's advisory committee may make a student subject to academic probation and dismissal. Minor Doctoral students pursuing a single major may choose to minor outside of the department or to take an in-depth minor within the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. If a minor outside the department is elected, the requirements are speci - fied by that unit. An in-depth minor within the department consists of 9 credit hours of graduate course work in an area of psychological and brain sciences other than that of the major. The specific courses making up such a minor must be approved by the student's advisory committee. Students pursuing a double major are not required to complete a minor (see Gen - eral Requirements section of the Graduate Bulletin). Other Provision Before being nominated to candidacy, all students are required to take P660 (as noted under \"Course Requirements\") and lead at least one lab section of P211 (under the supervision of the P211 instructor and gathering end of the semester teach - ing evaluations; the graduate student does not need to be the instructor of record for the lab section) or obtain equivalent teaching experience as approved by the Director of Graduate Studies or the department chair. The competency of the gradu - ate student's teaching will be evaluated by a faculty member teaching supervisor and if not adequate, the student will be asked to take remedial action, which may include additional training in teaching and an additional teaching assignment. Qualifying Examination Written and oral portions of the qualifying exam must be suc - cessfully passed by the beginning of the fifth regular semester of residency. Students with a double major may request one additional year before they take the qualifying examination and must successfully pass the exam by the beginning of the sev - enth regular semester of residency (see General Requirements section of the Graduate Bulletin). Students who do not pass the qualifying exam will be given an opportunity to retake the exam within one semester (i.e., by the end of the fifth semes - ter or for double majors by the end of the seventh semester). Students who do not successfully pass their second attempt at the qualifying examination will be subject to dismissal. Advisory and Research Committees Students must identify a major advisor and have an advi - sor throughout the course of their graduate studies. Student 460must form an advisory committee by the end of their second semester; later in their course of study, students must form a research (dissertation) committee. The student's committee (advisory or research) shall consult with the student, at least once per year, to help determine the student's course of gradu - ate study, develop a research program, approve the student's course selections, and review the student's progress in all areas (for example, but not limited to: completion of required courses, course grades, adequacy of teaching, and research progress). The student's committee will determine whether or not the student is making adequate progress in all areas. Should the advisory (or research) committee determine that a student is not making adequate progress in any area, this may be grounds for eliminating a student's department funding, probation, or dismissal from the program. Ph.D. Minor in Psychological and Brain Sciences Doctoral students in other departments may elect psychologi - cal and brain sciences as an outside minor. A minimum of four courses at the graduate level is required. The student must achieve a grade of at least B- in each course and an overall grade point average of at least 3.0. The specific courses must be approved by a faculty advisor who is a faculty member within the Psychological and Brain Sciences department and may include no more than one research course (P895).

Ringquist*, SPEA 223, (812) 855-0732 Degrees Offered Doctor of Philosophy in Public Affairs; Doctoral Minors in Non - profit Management, Public Management, Regional Economic Development, and Urban Affairs. Doctor of Philosophy in Public Affairs The Doctoral Program in Public Affairs was created to take advantage of the unique strengths of SPEA's interdisciplinary faculty and research programs, both of which have earned wide recognition from peer institutions, national and interna - tional agencies, and professional groups. The curriculum equips students with the necessary skills for independent research and analysis of problems, issues, and solutions in government and the nonprofit sector in the following four major fields: 1. Public Finance: the theory and practice of fiscal administra - tion, including public budgeting, revenue administration, and financial management; 2. Public Management: the design and operation of govern - mental institutions, including strategic/operations manage - ment and interrelationships between public and private organizations; 3. Public Policy Analysis: research methods and quantita - tive techniques for policy analysis, including the content, 465design, and evaluation of public programs; and 4. Environmental Policy: the study of and contribution to public policies that affect the environment, both domestic and international, including legal, economic, and other policy tools and approaches. Instead of being grounded in a traditional academic discipline, each of the fields has developed from several theoretical litera - tures applied to real-world public affairs problems. Although re - search is grounded in the social sciences, the context of inquiry reverses the normal research process. Instead of beginning with questions originating with discipline-based scholarship, the research process begins with public problems and issues. The research challenge, then, is to match available tools of inquiry to the research opportunities presented by problems. Admission Students apply to the School of Public and Environmental Affairs; those accepted are recommended to the University Graduate School for formal admission into the Ph.D. program. Application materials can be found at www.gradapp.indiana. edu/. Applicants to this program must have completed at least a bachelor's degree. Prospective students are required to submit (1) a statement of purpose, which should be as specific as possible and preferably should refer to potential research mentors by name; (2) official results of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE); (3) official transcripts of all undergraduate and graduate work completed; and (4) three letters of recom - mendation. Applicants whose native language is not English must also submit results of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Progress Review Committee Early in the student's program, but in no case later than the third semester in the program, the student must form a progress review committee. The committee consists of four to five members and includes at least one faculty member from each of the student's two chosen major fields of study and also a representative of his or her minor field. The committee members act as mentors and help monitor the selection and fulfillment of program requirements. The chairperson of the committee serves as the student's principal advisor. Degree Requirements The Ph.D. in Public Affairs degree requires the completion of at least 90 credit hours in advanced study and research beyond the baccalaureate. Typically, two-thirds of the 90 credit hours are taken in formal course work and one-third in thesis credit. Students completing a Master's in Public Affairs or similar de - gree may be allowed to transfer some of their graduate course work (30 hours maximum) if approved by their Progress Review Committee, though a prior Master's degree is not required for admission. Core Requirements The following three courses are required for all Public Affairs students: SPEA-V 680 Research Design and Methods in Public Affairs (3 cr.)SPEA-V 621 Seminar in Teaching Public and Environmental Af - fairs (2 cr.) This course prepares students for college teaching and their professional responsibilities toward current and future stu - dents. It is taken in a student's first year in the program. SPEA-V 691 Workshop in Public Policy (1 cr.) Each student is required to take this one-credit-hour course for credit for three semesters. The workshop features research presentations by faculty, visiting scholars, and advanced stu - dents. This workshop focuses on theory and research about public policy. Students are given opportunities to present and critique public policy reseach and to lead and participate in discussions of selected books and articles. Research Tool Skills Required research skills include a two semester quantitative analysis sequence and two additional elective courses or profi - ciency in a foreign language. The two-semester quantitative analysis sequence can be ful - filled a number of different ways, including one of the sequenc - es listed as follows: SPEA-V 606 Statistics for Research in Public Affairs I (3 cr.) and SPEA-V 607 Statistics for Research in Public Affairs II BUS-G 651 Economic Methods in Business I (3 cr.) and BUS-G 652 Economic Methods in Business II (3 cr.) ECON-E 572 Statistical Techniques in Economics II (3 cr.) and ECON-E 671 Econometrics I (3 cr.) POLS-Y 576 Political Data Analysis II (3 cr.) and POLS-Y 577 Advanced Topics in Political Science (3 cr.) SOC-S 554 Statistical Techniques in Sociology I (3 cr.) and SOC-S 650 Statistical Techniques in Sociology II (3 cr.) In addition, students must demonstrate either (1) advanced proficiency in quantitative analysis or specialized research skills by completing two additional courses approved by the student's Progress Review Committee, or (2) proficiency in a language appropriate to his/her field of study and approved by the Progressive Review Committee. To qualify as language-pro - ficient, a student must take a language proficiency exam from the appropriate language department at Indiana University. Major Fields Students select two of the four SPEA Public Affairs major fields (identified below) to prepare for their qualifying examinations. For each field, the student must complete required courses and approved electives. Public Management \u2014The design and operation of government and not-for-profit institutions, including strategic/operations management and interrelationships between public, private, and civil society organizations. Required courses: SPEA-V 671 Public Organization and Management I (3 cr.) SPEA-V 672 Public Organization and Management II (3 cr.)466Public Finance \u2014The theory and practice of fiscal administra - tion, including public budgeting, revenue administration, and financial management. Required courses: SPEA-V 666 Public Revenue (3 cr.) SPEA-V 668 Seminar in Public Budgeting (3 cr.) Public Policy Analysis \u2014Research methods and quantitative techniques for policy analysis, including the content, design, and evaluation of public programs. Required courses: SPEA-V 664 Seminar in Policy Analysis (3 cr.) SPEA-V 673 Public Policy Analysis and Management Science/ Operations Research (3 cr.) Environmental Policy \u2014Economic, law, politics, and implemen - tation of environmental policies in the U.S. and abroad. Required courses: Economics: SPEA-V 625 Environmental Economics (3 cr.) Law: SPEA-V 645 Environmental Law (3 cr.) or LAW-B 783 International Environmental Law (3 cr.) Policy: SPEA-V 710 Topics in Public Policy: Domestic Environmental Policy (3 cr.) or SPEA-V 710 Topics in Public Policy: International Environmental Policy (3 cr.) Minor Field Students select a minor field according to their research inter - ests. A three-to-four-course sequence is negotiated between the student and the Progress Review Committee, following the requirements of the department or school offering the minor. Among the minor fields chosen by students currently in the program are Economics, Finance, Political Science, Sociology, Geography, Economic Development, and Environmental Sci - ence. Major Junctures Progress Review Committee Each student is assigned an advisor on arrival in Bloomington. If the advisor sufficiently reflects a student's research interests, the student can request that the advisor serve as chairperson of the student's Progress Review Committee. The student may also select another professor who is more suited to the stu - dent's research interests. At the end of the first year, the student develops a Progress Review Committee. The committee, in cooperation with the student, defines program objectives, supervises the selection and completion of the minor field, monitors overall progress to - ward completion of course work requirements, and administers the qualifying exams. Members of the Progress Review Com -mittee should be scholars who know the student's academic record and who are recognized experts in the fields in which the student will stand examination. The committee will consist of four to five members chosen by the student in consultation with the director of the Ph.D. program. At least one member of the Progress Review Committee will be chosen from each of the student's two major fields. It is required that one member of the Progress Review Committee be a non-School professor and represent the outside minor. Third-Semester Review During the third semester, each student holds a third semes - ter review meeting with the Progress Review Committee. The purpose of the meeting is to reach an agreement between the student and the committee about the character and status of the student's program. This meeting also serves as a formal evaluation of the student's performance and prospects and includes a presentation of a research paper prepared by the student. Before the meeting of the Progressive Review Committee, the student develops a Progress Review Statement. The statement needs to include background professional and educational information, course work completed and planned in each con - centration and for basic and advanced tool skills, and tentative dates for taking qualifying exams and a discussion of a pro - posed dissertation topic. Once approved by the committee, the statement serves as a contract for the completion of degree requirements. In the progress review meeting, the committee members review the student's record of past and planned courses, the likely dissertation topic, and the quality of the research paper and its presentation. The committee determines whether the proposed program of courses will prepare the student for the examinations to be taken at the end of the course work as well as for the dissertation. The principal objective of the research paper is to allow the faculty to judge whether the student has the ability to com - plete all requirements for this research-oriented degree in a timely fashion. Thus, of most importance will be that the paper demonstrates the student's ability to carry out reasonably inde - pendent research and write the results in a well-reasoned and coherent fashion. The paper should also demonstrate that the student has a good command of the literature in the area and has the ability to use appropriate research methods in carrying out the analysis. It is anticipated that the progress review paper will be a revision of a substantial research paper prepared to fulfill a requirement for a regular course. (The student can, however, submit an entirely new paper to fulfill this require - ment.) The paper should be of a quality warranting presenta - tion at a professional society meeting. Qualifying Examinations After completion of course work, students take a written exam in each of their two major fields. The Examination Committee, may also require an oral examination at its discretion, but it is not mandatory. If there is an exam requirement in the minor department, the student must also complete a third exam. 467Once the examinations are successfully completed, the student is formally admitted to candidacy. Dissertation After filing for candidacy status, the doctoral candidate forms a Research Committee consisting of at least four faculty mem - bers, including one representative of the candidate's minor field. This committee is not necessarily identical to the Prog - ress Review Committee. The selection of Research Committee members should reflect the dissertation topic and the expertise of the faculty chosen. The candidate prepares a dissertation proposal to present and defend in a meeting of the Research Committee. The Research Committee reviews the research proposal and requires changes as needed. Once the dissertation research is completed, the candidate defends the thesis in an open oral examination meeting. The Research Committee is ultimately responsible for determining whether the dissertation is acceptable. Placement The Ph.D. Office, the director of the program, and individual faculty work hard to ensure that graduates of the program are placed in academic or research organizations. Although the Public Affairs program has only been operational since 1993, graduates have been very successful recently in obtaining such positions. Recent placements include Syracuse Univer - sity, Brigham Young University, University of Colorado, Ohio State University, Florida International University, Georgia State University, Iowa State University, the U.S. Department of Labor, National Taipei University, and Yonsei University in South Korea. Ph.D. Minor in Nonprofit Management (12 credit hours) Students in a Ph.D. program at Indiana University may select nonprofit management as an outside minor. The nonprofit management minor enables students to broaden their field of study by enhancing their knowledge of manage - ment and governance issues in the nonprofit sector.

Applicants for admission and for financial assistance are required to submit a statement of career goals, official results of the Graduate Record Examina - tion (GRE), official transcripts of all undergraduate and gradu - ate work, and a minimum of three letters of recommendation. Students whose native language is not English must also submit results of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The Joint Program Committee in Admissions and Financial Aid examines each application closely to determine suitability for the program. The committee looks beyond the formal aca - demic record at the applicant's demonstrated ability to pursue independent study, language and research-skill training, and maturity and experience. Progress Review Committee The progress review committee must include at least two faculty members from SPEA and two from the Department of Political Science. Members of the committee who hold joint appointments are considered representatives of their primary unit. The chairperson of the committee serves as the student's principal advisor. Early in the student's program term\u2014gener - ally during the third semester\u2014the committee provides the student with a formal review of the progress made toward the degree. Degree Requirements The University Graduate School requires doctoral students to complete 90 hours of graduate credit. Typically, two-thirds of the 90 credit hours are taken in formal course work and one-470third in thesis credit. Students holding a Master's in Public Af - fairs or similar degree may be allowed to transfer some of their graduate course work (30 credit hours maximum) if approved by their Progress Review Committee. Core Requirements Public Policy students are required to complete the following courses: SPEA-V 680 Research Design and Methods in Public Affairs (3 cr.) or POLS-Y 570 Introduction to the Study of Politics (3 cr.) SPEA-V 690 Seminar in Public Policy Process (3 cr.) or POLS-Y 565 Public Administration, Law, and Policy: Approaches and Issues (3 cr.) This course is offered alternately each fall semester by SPEA (V690) and the Department of Political Science (Y565). SPEA-V 691 Workshop in Public Policy (1 cr.) Each student is required to take this 1-credit-hour course for six semesters. The workshop features research presentations by faculty, visiting scholars, and advanced students. It prepares students to critique research in the field, to prepare manu - scripts for presentation and publication, and to defend new ideas and theories. There are two sections offered: one by SPEA and the other by the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis. SPEA-V 621 Seminar in Teaching Public and Environmental Affairs (2 cr.) or POLS-Y 550 Political Science and Professional Development (1-3 cr.) These courses prepare students for college teaching and their professional responsibilities toward current and future stu - dents. They are taken in a student's first year in the program. Research Tool Skills Required course work for research skills includes a basic two-semester statistics sequence and two additional elective courses or proficiency in a foreign language. Basic Tool Skills: The two-semester quantitative analysis sequence requirement is generally fulfilled through one of the course sequences listed below. SPEA-V 606 Statistics for Research in Public Affairs I (3 cr.) and SPEA-V 607 Statistics for Research in Public Affairs II (3 cr.) POLS-Y 575 Political Data Analysis I (3 cr.) and POLS-Y 576 Political Data Analysis II (3 cr.) SOC-S 554 Statistical Techniques in Sociology I (3 cr.) and SOC-S 650 Statistical Techniques in Sociology II (3 cr.) Advanced Tool Skills: In addition, students must demonstrate either (1) advanced proficiency in quantitative analysis or specialized research skills by completing two additional courses approved by the student's Progress Review Committee, or (2) proficiency in a language appropriate to his/her field of study approved by the Progress Review Committee. To qualify as language-proficient, a student must take a language proficiency exam from the ap - propriate language department at Indiana University. Fields of Concentration The School of Public and Environmental Affairs and the De - partment of Political Science share equally in delivering public policy as the major field of preparation and specialization. Students in the Public Policy Program select two concentration areas\u2014one from SPEA and one from Political Science\u2014in addi - tion to the required concentration in public policy. The fields of concentration include the following: SPEA Political Science Environmental Policy American Politics Policy Analysis Comparative Politics Public Management International Relations Public Finance Political Philosophy Political Theory and Methodology There are course offerings in SPEA and Political Science that help the student prepare for examinations in these fields, and students supplement their coursework with directed read - ings and research. There is no predetermined set of courses required of all students. Course selection is the responsibility of the student working with his or her Progress Review Commit - tee. Major Junctures Progress Review Committee The Progress Review Committee consists of from four to six fac - ulty members. Two SPEA faculty must be selected for the SPEA concentration and two Political Science faculty for the Political Science concentration. For the shared public policy concentra - tion there must be one SPEA and one Political Science faculty member. One faculty member is chosen by the student to act as the chair of the committee. The chairperson serves as the student's mentor and guides the student through the Progress Review and qualifying examination process. Before the meeting of the Progressive Review Committee, the student develops a Progress Review Statement. The statement needs to include background professional and educational information, course work completed and planned in each con - centration and for basic and advanced tool skills, and tentative dates for taking qualifying exams and a discussion of a pro - posed dissertation topic. Once approved by the committee, the statement serves as a contract for the completion of degree requirements. Qualifying Examinations The Political Science Department gives field exams on a regular basis. SPEA also offers qualifying exams on a regular basis. Typically, exams are offered twice per year. For the public policy exam, each student's exam schedule is negotiated with their 471exam committee. At their discretion, examiners for all fields may also require an oral examination. Dissertation After filing for candidacy status, the doctoral candidate forms a Research Committee consisting of at least four faculty mem - bers. Two of the members must be School of Public and Envi - ronmental Affairs faculty and two must be from Political Sci - ence. This committee may, but will not necessarily, be identical to the Progress Review Committee. The selection of Research Committee members should reflect the dissertation topic and expertise of the faculty chosen. The candidate prepares a dissertation proposal to present and defend in a meeting of the Research Committee. The Research Committee reviews the research proposal and requires changes as needed. Once the dissertation research is completed, the candidate defends the thesis in an open oral examination meeting. The Research Committee is ultimately responsible for determining whether the dissertation is acceptable. Placement The Ph.D. Office, the director of the program, and individual faculty work hard to ensure that graduates of the program are placed in academic or research organizations. Graduates of the Joint Program in Public Policy have been very successful in obtaining such positions. Recent placements include George Washington University, Emory University, Ohio State University, the University of Arizona, Ulsan University (South Korea), the University of Massachusetts, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the University of Washington.472University Graduate School 2009-2010 Academic Bulletin Religious StudiesUniversity Graduate School Kirkwood Hall 111 Indiana University Bloomington, IN 47405 (812) 855-8853 Contact: grdschl@indiana.edu College of Arts and Sciences Bloomington Chairperson Professor David Brakke* Departmental E-mail religion@indiana.edu Departmental URL www.indiana.edu/~relstud Graduate Faculty (An asterisk [*] denotes membership in the University Graduate School faculty with the endorsement to direct doctoral disser - tations.)

Graduate Record Examination General Test. In addition, Ph.D. applicants must submit a writing sample. Specific deadlines and expectations are spelled out in the Student Guide, available from the department office and on the department's Web site. Master of Arts Degree Grades B (3.0) average; B or higher for each course. Course Requirements A total of 30 credit hours, including R665, at least 2 other 600- level seminars, and 3 credit hours in each of the 3 divisions of the M.A. curriculum (religious traditions in the West, religious traditions in the East, critical issues in religious studies). Stu - dents choosing to write a thesis may register for 6 credit hours of R699; those opting for the language study project may reg - ister for 6 credit hours of R698. The distribution requirement is satisfied by taking courses in the Department of Religious Studies or cross-listed courses. Language Work All M.A. students must demonstrate reading proficiency in a language appropriate to their program of study, to be selected from the following: Arabic, Classical Chinese, French, Ger - man, Classical Greek, Hebrew (Biblical, Medieval, or Modern), Hindi, Japanese, Latin, Sanskrit, Spanish, Classical Tibetan. Another relevant language may be chosen with the approval of the director of graduate studies. Students may demonstrate proficiency in French, German, or Spanish by any of the three methods normally sanctioned by the University Graduate School. They may demonstrate proficiency in one of the other languages by successful completion of course work through the intermediate level or by departmental examination. Thesis/Language Study Project/Examination Option Students may complete degree requirements in one of three ways: (1) by writing a thesis, (2) by carrying out a language study project, or (3) by passing a comprehensive examination. The thesis option involves 6 credit hours of research and writ - ing in addition to 24 credit hours of course work. A thesis is 473generally 60-100 pages long and focuses on a theme, problem, and/or historical movement in the study of religion. The lan - guage study option involves use of a foreign language in which the primary or significant secondary sources of a religious tradition are written (e.g., Hebrew, Greek, Sanskrit, Chinese). The student must (a) demonstrate competence in the language (normally by passing an examination administered by the department); and (b) prepare a scholarly, annotated translation into English of a religious text written in that language, togeth - er with an introduction dealing with its historical and cultural context and significance. Students opting for the comprehen - sive examination may not take the examination until they have completed 30 credit hours of course work. The examination is in two parts: (a) general field examination, and (b) area exami - nation in the student's field of specialization. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Admission Requirements (1) Completion of an M.A. degree in the study of religion at Indiana University or another recognized institution, (2) a superior record in religious studies, (3) proficiency in one of the required languages, and (4) review and approval by a field committee consisting of faculty in the student's major area of interest. Grades No grades below B (3.0) will be counted toward this degree. Fields of Specialization A doctoral student specializes in one of the fields of study that have recognized faculty advisory committees (e.g., region, tradition, or methodological approach). Each field has its own specific requirements, including required courses, language skills, and qualifying examination structures and bibliographies, which are determined by the faculty in that field. For the cur - rently available fields of study, their faculty members, and their requirements, see the department's Web site and the Guide for Graduate Students in Religious Studies, which is available from the department office. With the approval of the department's graduate studies committee, a student may combine two fields or declare a special field of study and form an ad-hoc advisory committee for it. Course and Research Requirements Doctoral students must earn 90 hours of graduate credit, no more than 30 of which may be transferred from other institu - tions. The department allows up to 30 hours of M.A. credit toward the doctorate, which means that doctoral students must earn 60 hours of credit beyond the M.A. Up to 30 of the total 90 credit hours may be designated as thesis hours (R699, R799). Thus, students whose 30 M.A. credit hours include 6 hours of thesis credit will earn 36 credit hours of course work and 24 credit hours of thesis at the Ph.D. level. All doctoral students, regardless of field of specialization, are required to take R665 if they did not do so during an M.A. at Indiana University. All students must take a second thematic, methodological, or cross-cultural seminar in the department; the director of graduate studies will identify in advance courses that satisfy this requirement. Additional course requirements beyond the M.A. degree include 12 credit hours at the 700 level; R790, a one-credit hour course devoted to the develop - ment of teaching skills; and an outside minor (normally 12 credit hours). Doctoral students are required to produce two research papers prior to taking the qualifying examination. These papers will normally develop out of 700-level seminars, although they may grow out of other research projects as well. Papers should be modeled on a submission to a refereed journal in the student's field of study and should follow that journal's requirements for length and documentation (e.g., Chicago Manual of Style, Turabian, MLA, SBL Handbook of Style). A faculty member must approve each research paper for the student's file, but a stu - dent may not secure approval for both papers from the same faculty member. Length is normally 20-25 pages, exclusive of endnotes. An approved research paper may not be a language translation, a bibliographical essay, a text edition, or a set of field notes. Annotated translations may be accepted with the approval of the graduate studies committee. Language Work All candidates will be required to show proficiency in two modern languages of scholarship (French and German) and any necessary primary source languages required by their field. An - other modern language may be substituted for French or Ger - man with the approval of the director of graduate studies and the student's advisors. Proficiency in primary source languages is demonstrated through methods determined by the faculty in the student's field. Qualifying Examinations The faculty advisory committee in the student's field sets and supervises the qualifying examination after the student has completed all residency requirements. The exam consists of a total of 12 hours of written exams, which are divided into 3 or more parts, followed by an oral exam, all taken within a 3-week period. The exam is initially taken in its entirety, but it may be retaken once as a whole or in part at the discretion of the faculty committee. Termination of Enrollment in the Doctoral Program If a doctoral student falls below a 3.0 (B) grade point average, fails either the written or oral parts of the qualifying examina - tion two times, or otherwise fails to make satisfactory progress toward the degree, the director of graduate studies, in consul - tation with the student's advisory committee, can initiate steps to terminate the student's enrollment in the program. Final Examination Oral defense of dissertation. Ph.D. Minor in Religious Studies Students electing the study of religion as an outside minor in a doctoral program will be required to complete 12 credit hours of course work. A maximum of 6 credit hours may be 474transferred from other institutions or taken from cross-listed courses. At least 6 credit hours are to be taken in the depart - ment. Courses 500-level courses are attached to upper-level undergraduate courses. 600- and 700-level courses are graduate seminars and sometimes require the instructor's permission to enroll.

The Russian and East Europe - an Institute master's program gives students a broad under - standing of the geographical area and its peoples while provid - ing the opportunity to examine in depth the aspect of Russian and East European studies that most interests them. The dual degrees add high-level professional training. Students may focus on the study of Russia, another country or region of the former Soviet Union, or East Central or Southeastern Europe. Within their chosen geographic area, students may concentrate on the study of a particular discipline (business, history, library science, information science, political science, literature, public affairs, or some other) while also taking courses outside of that discipline. REEI also offers a Graduate Certificate Program and a Ph.D. Minor Program. Master of Arts Degree The REEI master's degree program is intended to prepare area specialists for nonacademic careers in government and private- sector fields such as research and foreign aid, or in exchange organizations, journalism, and business. Students may also choose to follow the REEI degree with advanced graduate studies. The program normally takes two years to complete. Its aim is to provide a broad interdisciplinary introduction to the Russian and East European area, with language competency appropriate for professional research. Admission Requirements Bachelor's degree with evidence of superior ability and comple - tion of the Graduate Record Examination. Students who intend to specialize in East Central, European, Southeast European, or Central Asian studies do not need previous study in languages of those areas for admission. For work in Russian area studies, proficiency in Russian language equivalent to two years of col - lege study is required. Course Requirements Thirty (30) credit hours of graduate course work to be distribut - ed as follows: (1) R600 Proseminar in Russian and East Europe - an Area Studies (3 credits) to be taken the first fall semester of enrollment; (2) four courses (3 credits each) from area studies offerings, one each from the social science group, historical/ geographical group, sociocultural group, and literature group; (3) four courses (3 credits each) in the area of concentra - tion. The concentration can be disciplinary (e.g., comparative politics, or business and economics); or it can be geographic (e.g., East Central Europe or Russia); and (4) REEI R601 Inter - disciplinary Colloquium in Russian and East European Studies (3 credits). All course requirements must be completed with an average grade of B or above. M.A. Essay and Interdisciplinary Oral Examination The paper by a student in the Interdisciplinary Colloquium in Russian and East European Studies (R601) usually becomes the M.A. essay. The essay must be interdisciplinary in focus and use research in the language of concentration as a defining element. In other words, the foreign language sources must form part of the foundation on which the argument of the es -say rests. Three REEI faculty members evaluate the essay and administer an oral examination that explores the interdisciplin - ary implications of the essay within the context of the student's graduate course work. The essay should not exceed 13,000 words in length (not counting footnotes/endnotes, bibliogra - phy, or tabular material). Language Requirement Successful completion of the Russian and East European Oral Proficiency Examination requires a knowledge of Russian at intermediate to high level or knowledge of another area lan - guage at the second-year level. Language courses do not count toward the REEI degree requirements, but may be necessary to ensure proficiency. The REEI Oral Proficiency Examination in Russian takes approxi - mately 60 minutes and requires that the student demonstrate fourth-year (intermediate high) proficiency by (1) participating in an oral interview with the examiner (10-25 minutes) and (2) orally translating a passage from an article (150 words) into English. For the translation section of the exam, the student will be given 15 minutes to prepare the passage and may use a dictionary. The REEI Oral Proficiency Examination in other area languages takes approximately 30 minutes and requires that the student demonstrate second-year (intermediate) proficiency by (1) carrying on a conversation on everyday topics in the lan - guage; (2) presenting a brief talk (five minutes) on a subject in the student's field and answering questions on the subject matter presented; and (3) orally translating a passage from an article (75 words) into English. For the translation section of the exam, the student will be given 15 minutes to prepare the pas - sage and may use a dictionary.

The increasing availability of high-performance computers has led to a method of scientific inquiry based on mathematical mod - els solved by means of numerical computations, analyzed and viewed by means of advanced computer graphics. Carrying out research by these means is necessarily multidisciplinary, calling on advanced skills in areas that span many classical divisions of academia. The Ph.D. minor in scientific computing provides the interdepartmental education necessary to equip students for research within this paradigm. Scientific computing courses are generally organized into four categories: numerical analysis, scientific applications, scientific visualization, and high-perfor - mance computing. Students are encouraged to develop expertise in more than one of those areas. Course Requirements Twelve (12) credit hours in approved courses, 6 credit hours of which must be outside the student's major department. The course P573 Introduction to Scientific Computing I has been created as an introductory course for students in the program. Students entering with a background in computational sci - ence or engineering, in consultation with their advisor on the Scientific Computing Committee, may omit this course from their curriculum. Students develop their course of study with two faculty: one from the student's home department and the other a member of the Graduate Committee on Scientific Computing from outside the student's home department. The proposed course of study will be submitted for approval by the Graduate Committee on Scientific Computing. If approved, a letter detailing the course of study will be signed by the direc - tor with copies given to the student and the student's home department. Significant changes to the course of study need to undergo the same process of development and approval. Certi - fication of completion of the minor requirements will be by the director or an appointed representative. Courses Courses that can be used to satisfy the Scientific Computing minor requirement include, but are not limited to, the follow - ing list: (Mathematics), (Mathematics), G514 (Geological Sciences), G612 (Geological Sciences), and G614 (Geological Sciences). 487University Graduate School 2009-2010 Academic Bulletin Second Language StudiesUniversity Graduate School Kirkwood Hall 111 Indiana University Bloomington, IN 47405 (812) 855-8853 Contact: grdschl@indiana.edu College of Arts and Sciences Bloomington Departmental E-mail dsls@indiana.edu Departmental URL www.indiana.edu/~dsls Chairperson Professor Kathleen Bardovi-Harlig* Graduate Faculty (An asterisk [*] denotes membership in the University Graduate School faculty with the endorsement to direct doctoral disser - tations.)

Required Core Courses Every student in the program will take six core courses (18 cr. total): S511 Second Language Syntax (3 cr.) S512 Second Language Phonology (3 cr.) S532 Models of Second Language Acquisition (3 cr.) S533 Second Language Acquisition Research Design (3 cr.) S536 Research in Second Language Pedagogical Contexts (3 cr.) S670 Language Typology (3 cr.) Seminars (3 cr. each) All students will complete at least 6 credits in two seminars in Second Language Studies. These courses may be applied to other requirements as well. Breadth requirements All students will complete at least 3 credits each in four of the following five areas for a total of 12 credits. There is no restric - tion on the department in which these courses may be com - pleted. Courses in the Second Language Studies core cannot be used to complete this requirement. Historical Linguistics/Language Contact/Language Revitalization Sociolinguistics/Pragmatics/Discourse Analysis Morphology/Syntax/Semantics Pedagogy Phonetics/Phonology Research Concentration Students will establish a research concentration in consulta - tion with their committees. A research concentration may be established by enrolling in five courses in the area of specialty, by working in an appropriate research laboratory or research group, by undertaking appropriate field work or training, by conducting approved independent research and publication, or by a combination of these. Students who satisfy their research concentrations through participation in a research lab or research group or through independent research and publica - tion may count the equivalent of up to three courses (9 credits) of S690 (Directed Readings) toward the 66 credits required for the doctorate. The research concentration is represented in the research qualifying examination. Minor and Language Concentrations All students will be required to have a minor. The selected minor should be appropriate to the student's choice of subdis - cipline within Second Language Studies. Appropriate minors 489include Anthropology, Cognitive Science, Communication and Culture, foreign languages, Language Education, Linguistics, Psycholinguistics, and Sociology. In all cases the number of hours to be included in the minor will be consistent with the requirements of the unit granting the minor. Some students may wish to pursue a significant concentration in a particular language area or in English as a Second Lan - guage. Students pursuing a language concentration in French, German, or Spanish will ordinarily take at least 21 hours in the Department of French and Italian, the Department of Ger - manic Studies, or the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, as appropriate. (Additional language concentrations may be added in the future.) Providing a student has completed all the requirements for the minor in the language department, there is no need to complete both a minor and a language concentra - tion. The language concentration will be the student's minor of record. Language Requirements The language requirement for the Ph.D. is two research lan - guages, which will ordinarily be languages of scholarship in the student's specialty. In addition, students will take 1-2 courses in a language outside of the language family of the student's native language (for example, a native English speaker would take courses in a non-Indo-European language; in contrast, a native speaker of Chinese might take courses in Russian). To satisfy this requirement, a student could complete a one-year language class, take the Field Methods sequence in Linguistics (L653-L654), or take a course on the structure of an appropriate language. Qualifying Examinations All students must pass a set of examinations, consisting of a General Qualifying Examination (GQE) and a Research Qualify - ing Examination (RQE). These examinations are intended to provide an institutional structure for students as they move from taking courses to writing a dissertation. General Qualifying Examination (GQE) The GQE is meant to demonstrate the ability to synthesize ma - terial explored in courses and in independent reading. The GQE will consist of two cloistered examinations, each three hours in duration. Students will elect two of the following five areas, corresponding to the breadth requirements. Historical Linguistics/Language Contact/Language Revitalization Second Language Morphology/Syntax/Semantics Second/Foreign Language Pedagogy Second Language Phonetics/Phonology Second Language Sociolinguistics/Pragmatics/Discourse Analysis Most students will take the GQE the semester after coursework is completed. In general, the two cloistered exams will be of - fered on two consecutive days in October and in February. The GQE schedule will be posted by the end of each semester by the committee, each student will inform the Director of Gradu - ate Studies of his or her two areas no later than one month in advance of the scheduled exam. Appropriate faculty members will submit potential questions to the Director of Graduate Studies, who in turn will select and edit questions and coordi - nate grading. On any given cloistered exam, the student will have the op - portunity to de-select at least one question; the student will be required to answer two of three questions. All students selecting a given area in a given semester will receive the same questions. All responses to any given exam question will be graded by the same two faculty members. The grades are Pass and Fail. To pass any given cloistered exam, at least three of the four grades assigned must be Pass. If a student fails to pass one or both sections, s/he may take it a second time when the GQE is offered in the next semester. After consultation with his or her advisory committee, such a student may also select a differ - ent exam area. Research Qualifying Examination (RQE) The RQE is designed to demonstrate that students have de - veloped sufficient depth in their understanding of a particular constellation of research questions and that their academic writing skills are sufficiently well honed that they are able to begin meaningful work on their dissertations. In contrast to the GQE, the research exams will be scheduled individually. We rec - ommend that the research exam be completed in the semester following the successful completion of the GQE. Nevertheless, students are required to have demonstrated preparation in a research focus to the satisfaction of their advisory commit - tees before they will be permitted to proceed with the RQE. In contrast to the GQE, the advisory committee administers the RQE and reports successful completion of the examination to the Director of Graduate Studies. The RQE may take one of two forms: Option 1: a publishable research paper which pilots the stu - dent's dissertation research, or Option 2: a research essay which will be completed by the student over the course of one full week. For Option 1, the student must complete, to the advisory com - mittee's satisfaction, an original sole-authored research paper in the student's intended area of dissertation research, which in the committee's judgment, is ready for submission to one of the following journals: Studies in Second Language Acquisition, Second Language Research, Language Learning, TESOL Quar - terly, or Applied Linguistics. Research papers are 8,000-10,000 words in length including text, references, tables, figures, and appendices. For Option 2, the advisory committee will assign a single question arising from extensive consultation with the student reflecting the individual student's research focus, as defined through a series of courses, approved independent research, participation in research groups or labs, outside publications, or a combination of these. The student is to complete the essay within exactly one week, but is free to employ data collected 490and analyzed ahead of time. Dissertation Proposal The proposal for the dissertation must be approved by the stu - dent's research committee. Proposals should include pilot stud - ies. The research committee may have the same membership as the advisory committee or the student may choose different members. The advisor for the dissertation will be a faculty member in the Department of Second Language Studies and a member of the Graduate Faculty. One of the three other mem - bers of the committee will be based in the minor department or in the department of the student's language concentration. The student will defend the proposal at a public colloquium. Dissertation (up to 24 cr.) Students are required to complete a dissertation that consti - tutes an original and significant contribution to the field of Second Language Studies. The dissertation must be success - fully presented to the research committee in an oral defense as described in the University Graduate School Academic Bulletin. Ph.D. Minor in Second Language Studies The minor consists of a minimum of four courses (12 credit hours) in Second Language Studies. Courses should be at the 500 level or above. A grade point average of 3.0 (B) or bet - ter must be achieved in these courses. All SLS minors must include S532. The prerequisite for S532 is a graduate level course in morphosyntax; if taken in SLS this prerequisite will count toward the minor. A specific program for satisfying the minor requirement must be developed in consultation with the student's minor advisor. Graduate Certificate in TESOL and Applied Linguistics Students not intending to get a Master's degree may wish to pursue a program leading to the Certificate in TESOL and Ap - plied Linguistics. The requirements for this certificate include twenty (20) credit hours, approved by the department. Nor - mally, students will complete T510, S511, T514, S532, T534, T535, and T550. Other hours will be selected in consultation with a departmental advisor. A grade point average of 3.0 (B) must be maintained for the 20 credit hour certificate program. The certificate is a postbaccalaureate award.

Attention is also called to the Summer Workshop in Slavic and East European Languages, which offers a special certificate program that provides intensive language training in Russian at advanced levels not available during the regular academic year. The workshop also offers first-year and occasionally second- year courses in other Slavic, East European, and Eurasian languages. Special Departmental Requirements (See also general University Graduate School requirements.) General Provision Students wishing the recommendation of the department for teaching positions must present evidence of their ability to teach Russian through actual teaching experience under de - partmental supervision. Master of Arts Degree Admission Requirements Graduate Record Examination General Test. Entering students are expected to have: (1) active knowledge of the Russian language adequate for graduate study, as determined by a proficiency examination based on the department's fourth- year course, (2) a general acquaintance with the major works of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Russian literature equivalent to at least the materials covered in a two-semester undergraduate survey course, and (3) a reading knowledge of German or French. Students seeking to study a departmental language other than Russian must demonstrate a clear interest in that language (e.g., prior study, overseas experience in the relevant country, etc.) for admission. Students enrolling with deficiencies in any of the areas listed previously are encouraged to remove them during the summer preceding the start of their graduate work. Students with a Russian language deficiency are urged to apply to the Summer Workshop. Courses taken to satisfy deficiency requirements in Russian, French, or German will not carry graduate credit and will lie outside of the 30 credit hours required for the M.A. de - gree. Students with a deficiency in Russian literature may take the departmental undergraduate survey courses (R263-R264) without credit. General Course Requirements A minimum of thirty (30) credit hours of courses carrying graduate credit, at least 20 of which must be taken in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures. Track Requirements In addition to the general course requirements, students pursu - ing the M.A. degree shall complete one of the four programs described as follows. Tracks 1 and 2 are structured primarily for preparing students who wish to continue toward a Ph.D. 494degree with a specialization in Russian literature or Slavic linguistics; Track 3 is designed mainly for students pursuing a departmental language other than Russian; Track 4 is for those with other career goals in mind. Track 1 Russian Literature M.A. Requirements 1. R500 Proseminar in Russian Literature 2. 571 Old Church Slavonic or L576 History of the Russian Literary Language or L501 Structure of Russian I 3.

(Students taking this option are encouraged to fulfill the additional requirements for a certificate in the Russian and East European Institute. See fol - lowing.) Track 4 Dual Concentration Two survey-type Slavic literature courses at the graduate level; plus two additional graduate courses in the department; and a program of at least 9 graduate credits in one other department approved by the graduate advisor, such as business, compara - tive literature, economics, fine arts, geography, history, linguis - tics, literature, music, political science, or a foreign language. Students may be exempted from Slavic language courses by passing proficiency examinations. Examination No examination is required for a terminal M.A. degree, but a doctoral admission examination, based on the M.A. program for Tracks 1, 2, or 3, is required for admission to Ph.D. work and must normally be passed before the student registers for the fifth semester of graduate work. (A student working simultane - ously for the M.A. degree and an area certificate in the Russian and East European Institute must pass the doctoral admission examination before registering for the sixth semester of gradu - ate work.) Master of Arts for Teachers Degree Admission Requirements Applicants should have a knowledge of the Russian language adequate for graduate study (a minimum of three years is acceptable, but four is preferred). A broad, solid undergradu - ate program in the liberal arts is strongly recommended. New students must take a proficiency examination in Russian before registering, and those whose performance is inadequate will be required to take appropriate courses in Russian until their proficiency reaches the level required of B.A. candidates in the department.

Social Informat - ics research examines the roles of technologies in social and organizational change and the social shaping of ICT. SI research and SI courses are organized within diverse fields, including information systems, telecommunications, journalism, informa - tion science, and political science. One key goal of the field is to shape ICTs and policies relevant to them in order to enhance human communication and lead to more acceptable techno - logical developments at organizational and social levels. Course Requirement for the Ph.D. Minor in Social Informatics (12 credit hours) This minor consists of four courses (12 credits), selected from an approved list of courses as described below. Please note that a student minoring in SI cannot include classes from his or her home department in the minor. Students who complete the Ph.D. minor in SI at Indiana University must demonstrate proficiency in a set of courses that examines the design, uses, consequences and/or policies of ICT use in social, cultural, or institutional contexts. The SI Ph.D. minor emphasizes theoreti - cal and methodological issues, as well as substantive issues. The student must submit a written proposal to the Steering Committee describing a detailed course of study. The proposal will explain the student's focus of study, its relationship to SI, the relationship of proposed SI courses to the overall program of study, and the likely dissertation topic or area. It will also include the name of the student's SI Ph.D. minor advisor. While the SI Ph.D. minor is likely to be completed before a student develops a detailed dissertation proposal, it is expected that the dissertation will address issues related to social informatics. If a student is interested in a course that is not on the approved course list, he or she can petition the director and Steering Committee to have the course included as part of the minor; the procedure is described below. The complete proposal must be approved by the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee must also attest that the approved course of study has been completed successfully. Stu - dents seeking the Ph.D. minor in SI must obtain the approval of their Ph.D. Advisory Committees. The range of courses listed on the RKCSI courses at http://rkcsi.indiana.edu/index.php/cours - es is designed to enable students to construct a program for the Ph.D. minor in SI that is relevant to their primary research interests. This program of courses should include some courses that have strong theoretical and/or methodological content, as well as substantive issues. Students who propose taking \"topics courses\" (such as SLIS S604, S601/602, INFO I590, R601) as electives to help satisfy these requirements must satisfy the Steering Committee that the particular course they wish to take is relevant to the subject matter of SI. Further courses will be added to the list on an ongoing basis at the discretion of the Steering Committee.501Courses Specific Course Requirements Students seeking a Ph.D. minor in Social Informatics must com - plete four graduate level courses (12 hours) that have been se - lected from the courses listed on the RKCSI Courses at Indiana page; this list includes courses that have been specifically iden - tified as approved for the Ph.D. minor. One of the four courses for the SI minor must be taken in the School of Journalism, the Department of Telecommunications, the School of Informat - ics and Computing, or the School of Library and Information Science and this course, which will serve as a foundation course for the minor, must be approved by the committee. This course should be taken first and may not be in the student's home school or department. Other courses in these schools and de - partments may be taken as electives. Possibilities include: School of Journalism J530 Issues in New Communication Technologies J614 Communication and National Development School of Library and Information Science S514 Computerization in Society S518 Communication in Electronic Environments Telecommunications Department T551 Communication, Technology, and Society T601 Origins of the Information Age School of Informatics and Computing I503 Social Impact of Information Technologies In addition, students can propose, in consultation with their ad - visors, that their minor include other SI courses that are not on this list or that are on the list, but have not yet been formally approved for the SI minor. Such proposals should include syllabi and other detailed information about the course. The proposal should make a convincing case that the course is aligned with one or more main SI themes, such as the complex relationships among technology, people, their work and/or play, and the contexts within which people interact with technology. Electives Students seeking the Ph.D. minor in social informatics must complete an additional three courses (9 credit hours). These additional courses must be selected from the list above or the following list. The elective courses should be taken from at least two departments or schools other than the student's home academic unit. The Social Informatics Program is devel - oping rapidly at IU, and we expect that additional doctoral-level courses will be offered each year. Students can propose that their minors include other social informatics courses that are not included on this list. Such proposals should include syllabi and other detailed information about the course.

Language/Research-Skill Requirement Proficiency in multiple languages is an important tool for research. Therefore, students should consult with their advi - sors and the director of graduate studies before determining which languages they will choose for proficiency. For all plans, students must have reading proficiency in two additional languages (or one in-depth proficiency) besides English and the language of the target program. These may be satisfied in the following ways: 1. Proficiency for students taught inside the Department of Spanish and Portuguese: a. Spanish: completing with a grade of B (3.0) or better, S105, or the equivalent, and one course at the 500 level or higher (excluding S517); b. Portuguese: completing, with a grade of B (3.0) or bet - ter, P135, or the equivalent, and one course at the 500 level or higher; c. Catalan: completing, with a grade of B (3.0) or better, two courses at the 400 level or higher; d. In-depth language proficiency: The student must first establish proficiency in the language by one of the methods listed above (a-c). Then the student must pass, with a grade of B or better, another course at the 500 level or higher. 2. Proficiency for students not taught in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese: The Department of Spanish and Portuguese accepts language proficiency by any of the fol - lowing methods, provided that these also fulfill the target language department's proficiency requirements: a. passing a language proficiency examination; b. passing a 300-level, or higher, literature, linguistics or culture course with a grade of B (3.0) or better; c. passing the second half of a 400-level reading course (492) with a grade of B (3.0) or better; d. in-depth language proficiency: The student must first establish proficiency in the language by one of the methods listed above (a-c). Then the student must pass, with a grade of B (3.0) or better, another course at the 500 level or higher. The course must be taught in the target language. Ph.D. students in linguistics may replace reading proficiency in one foreign language with two 500-level courses in statistics or two courses, chosen in consultation with the Director of Hispanic linguistics, in computer science. Neither English nor the language of the degree program may be presented as one of the foreign languages. Qualifying Examination See individual program outlines for qualifying exam require - ments. Final Examination Oral, primarily a defense of the dissertation. Other Provisions Competence in speaking Spanish or Portuguese fluently and with correct diction is expected of every student; hence, for - eign residence in a Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking country prior to receiving the Ph.D. is highly desirable.

Introduction The graduate curriculum in Speech and Hearing Sciences com - bines training for students wishing to pursue clinical careers in speech-language pathology or audiology, as well as graduate studies in speech, language, and hearing sciences, speech- language pathology, and audiology for research or academic careers. The department is accredited by the Council on Aca - demic Accreditation of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Degrees Offered Master of Arts in Speech and Hearing Science, Doctor of Philosophy in Speech and Hearing Sciences, and Ph.D. minor in Speech and Hearing Sciences. (The College of Arts and Sci - ences offers the Doctor of Audiology degree.) Special Departmental Requirements Adequate Progress Individual student progress will be evaluated annually by program faculty. Students who are judged to be making inadequate progress on the basis of poor grades, incomplete coursework, or insufficient research accomplishments may be placed on academic probation. Students on academic proba - tion will be offered a timetable for remedial work and re-test - ing, and will have restricted access to coursework and clinical experiences. If deficiencies are not corrected according to the revised timetable, the student is likely to be dismissed from 529the program. (See also general University Graduate School requirements.) Master of Arts in Speech and Hearing Sci - ences Course Requirements A minimum of 36 credit hours, with no more than 6 credit hours in S780. Practicum Students wishing to receive certification must enroll in clinical practicum (S561, S570, S563, or school practicum) each semes - ter, and must complete at least three semesters of practicum with grades of B (3.0) or higher. Students who wish to earn the M.A. degree but do not choose to complete practicum require - ments and clinical certification may complete a non-clinical M.A. degree. Examinations Each student must pass a written comprehensive examination evaluated by a faculty committee. Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Speech and Hearing Sciences Course Requirements At least 90 credit hours with grade of B (3.0) or above. This coursework must include S685, S683, two or three area courses (S686, S696, or S702), and courses required for an outside minor. In addition, students must complete 6 credit hours of graduate coursework in experimental design and statistics or demonstrate equivalent competency. No more than 12 credit hours of coursework in experiemental design or statistics may count towards the required total of 90 credit hours for the degree. Additional required coursework may be determined by the student's graduate advisory committee. Examinations After completing the required coursework, students must pass a qualifying exam consisting of written questions and oral de - fense of the answers. Exam questions are tailored for each stu - dent by their faculty advisory committee, which also evaluates student performance.

It encompasses a scholarly introduction to sophisticated techniques in survey research and the opportu - nity for a student to tailor the program to fit within their other graduate work.Survey research has expanded with acceleration in the past three decades. It is now widely used across a number of disci - plines. For example, it is used by medical researchers and pub - lic health specialists in epidemiological studies, evaluation of public information campaigns, and to assess behavioral and at - titudinal risks for disease and injury. It is used by public admin - istrators, in fields such as urban planning and criminal justice to evaluate current programs, assess the impact of public safety campaigns, and assess citizen support for new developments in public facilities. Educational leaders use surveys or diverse ac - tivities including marketing strategies for higher education insti - tutions and scheduling of class and transportation for elemen - tary and secondary schools. Attorneys and legal professionals look at the impact of programs and activities on jury selection, perceptions of courtroom behavior, and trust/support for new and existing statutes. Business leaders are constantly monitor - ing the public's attitudes and behaviors in regards to product development, customer satisfaction, marketing strategies, and even location of facilities. Not-for-profit agencies estimate the potential for enlisting volunteers, the potential for fundraising, and effectiveness of fundraising campaigns. Of course, beyond such applied uses, academicians in many disciplines use survey data to study a broad range of phenomena including financial risk-taking, voting behavior, family satisfaction, medical treat - ment preferences, and a host of other areas. Although many people use survey data, few are trained in the twin goals of the certificate program\u2014evaluation of the quality of survey data and the implementation of programs of survey research from data collection through analysis. The main objec - tive of this program is to provide a graduate student with such training through an interdisciplinary approach to all aspects of survey research. Students considering application to the certificate program are welcome in the classes (with prerequisites or instructor's permission). Up to 9 credit hours earned as a graduate nonde - gree student or graduate degree student and approved by the program's director may be applied toward the certificate upon admission to the program. Course Requirements The Survey Research Certificate Program consists of a total of 15 credit hours of course work at the 500-600 level. No more than 3 credit hours may be transferred from another institution and no undergraduate-level courses may be used toward the certificate. The certificate program consists of a graduate core curriculum of two courses and three courses that may come from a student's regular graduate program and approved by the certificate's three-person program committee, consisting 539of the director of the certificate program, a political science faculty member, and one other faculty member from the desig - nated program faculty. Required Core Courses (6 credits) POLS Y567 Survey Research: Approaches and Issues (3 cr.) An introductory seminar that will discuss all the key approaches, issues, and concepts in survey research, allowing students to identify more specific issues that may be examined in their elective courses.

A capstone semi - nar designed to be taken as last course in certificate program and to examine current issues in the application of survey research to public policy. Students will share with students from a variety of disciplines their particular applications to increase interdisciplinary awareness of problems and prospects of survey research. Electives (9 cr.) Students will be required to complete 9 additional credit hours of course work chosen from a group of primary courses or alternates. This list of alternates is subject to approval by the program committee and substitutions may be approved by that committee. The list is designed to maximize the flexibility of an interdisciplinary field such as survey research. Courses are of - fered with varying regularity, but the curriculum is designed to allow each discipline to adapt its courses to fit students' needs in its area. POLS Y575 Political Data Analysis I (3 cr.) Introduces students to quantitative research methods for studying politics, focus - ing on topics that are statistical in content or that must be addressed for statistics to make sense.

Admission Requirements Course requirements are flexible to accommodate students with interests in vision science but with varying backgrounds. A bachelor's degree (or equivalent) is required. Course work with appropriate laboratories in the following areas is strongly recommended: optics, computing and engineering, physics, biology, mathematics through differential and integral calculus, statistics, and psychology of sensation and perception. Degree Requirements Students must demonstrate breadth of knowledge in vision science. This requirement is normally fulfilled by completion of V700 and V701 with a minimum grade of B in each course. Each semester, students are required to register for and par - ticipate in the weekly vision science seminar (V765) known as \"Oxyopia.\" Participation implies that the seminar will be taken for credit and that the student will make a presentation. Students must complete ethics training, usually fulfilled by completion of V792. Students commence their research training by joining an ongo - ing research project directed by a faculty member chosen by the student. The research topic will be formulated in consulta - tion with the faculty member and an advisory committee. The topic may or may not be in the same field in which the student expects to do dissertation research. Master of Science Degree Course Requirements A total of 30 credit hours is required, of which 15 credit hours must be didactic hours in vision science (or approved substi - tutes), generally excluding seminars. Students holding the O.D. degree or enrolled concurrently in the O.D. and M.S. programs may accelerate progress by receiving up to 4 graduate credit hours completed in the optometry curriculum. Students must complete courses that satisfy knowledge base in statistics, research design and vision science. Research Requirements Candidates must submit a written research report by the end of the first year in residence. Students enroll in a minimum of 3 hours of research credit per semester. A thesis research proposal must be submitted and approved by the end of the first year of study. Thesis Required. 553Doctor of Philosophy Degree Course Requirements A total of 90 credit hours is required, of which 30 must come from didactic courses with grades of B or higher. Students hold - ing the O.D. degree, or enrolled in the O.D. program, may apply up to 6 credit hours to this requirement of 30 didactic credit hours. When the grade point average of a student falls below 3.0, the student is placed on academic probation. During the first year students will complete two Vision Science survey courses (V700 and V701). Students will select at least one minor subject in any relevant field of study, subject to approval by their advisory committee. The requirements for the minor are determined by the depart - ment or program offering the minor. A specialized inter-depart - mental minor is also possible, if approved by the University Graduate School before classes are taken. Vision Science Ph.D. Degree requirements: In order to ensure adequate progress toward the Ph.D. degree, all students must achieve the following milestones at the end of years 1, 2, and 3 of the program. Advancement to Second Year exam: At the end of the first year in the program each student must pass a written examination covering a wide selection of vision science topics in order to ad - vance to the second year of the program. By this time, students should also have demonstrated an appropriate command of spoken and written English. Advancement to Third Year: By the end of the second year all students should have identified the area of study and the specific experiments that will eventually constitute their Ph.D. thesis. This requirement will be met by submitting a formal abstract describing the proposed experiments to the Graduate Program coordinator. This abstract must be accompanied by written approval of the Ph.D. advisor. Advancement to Candidacy: By the end of the third year, each student must complete a written and oral qualifying examina - tion. These examinations are administered by the student's advisory committee. The written component is the dissertation proposal, and can be in the form of a grant application. The requirement of 30 credit hours of didactic course work must be fulfilled before the qualifying examination. After successful completion of the qualifying exam, each student will be ad - vanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Participation in the Ph.D. program will be terminated if a student fails the qualify - ing examination twice. The final milestone is completion of the dissertation. Completion of Dissertation: After completion of the writ - ten dissertation, it is presented and defended at a scheduled seminar meeting. The dissertation must be approved by the student's research committee. The student is responsible for submitting the final approved dissertation to the University Graduate School.IU Office of Research and University Graduate School (RUGS) provides a guide to the preparation of theses and dissertations. Related forms may be acquired from the IU School of Optom - etry Office of Student Administration.

Women's Studies Program Women's studies brings together faculty, women, and some men interested in women's issues in teachings, research, and service. Interdisciplinary in nature, WOST explores a wide range of issues as seen through the perspective of gender. Women's studies can help shape a vision of women's position in society that will enable students to make a more meaningful contribu - tion wherever their career paths and future engagements may lead. A degree in women's studies should enhance a student's effectiveness in virtually any career. For careers in law or social service, WOST gives insight into social pr actices that oppress women, such as rape, abuse, and job discrimination. For careers in biology, medicine, nursing, or other allied health professions, WOST offers an understanding of women's health needs. For business careers, WOST teaches students to understand the barriers and the opportunities for women seeking careers in the corporate world.
