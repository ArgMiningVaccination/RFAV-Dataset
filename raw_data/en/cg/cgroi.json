Toxicities are autoimmune-like inflammation that may affect any organ system. The management of toxicities is largely based on severity and grade (see guidelines/CTCAE). Mild and minimally symptomatic toxicities may be managed with supportive care and close monitoring (e.g., topical steroids for a mild rash). Severe and life-threatening toxicities usually require the following: - High-dose glucocorticoid therapy (prednisone 1-2mg/kg or equivalent) - Withholding immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy - Supportive management (e.g., supplemental oxygen for hypoxia in pneumonitis) Additional Resources [Review of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Toxicity](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1703481) [Brief Review of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor "}
