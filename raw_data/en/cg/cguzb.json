(Suggested reading: [The Ideal Medical School Application Timeline](https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-application-timeline)) ---- Part 4: Johns Hopkins Medical School secondary essays (examples included) After submitting the AMCAS application, you'll turn to the Johns Hopkins secondary essays. Though the prerequisites and requirements we outlined above are important, it's often the less tangible qualifications and traits that often set candidates apart. Top-tier medical schools want to know that you have a story and something to offer their institution beyond high test scores. They want to know you'll be a future leader in healthcare, that you've faced and overcome challenges, and that you have a history of compassionate service. Furthermore, they want to know that you can articulate these qualitative aspects. That's what your Johns Hopkins secondary essays are for, and why they're such an important part of your application. Below, you'll find examples for each [secondary essay prompt](https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-secondary-essay-prompts), as well as pointers for how to craft essays that make your application stand out. The examples are based on composites of students we've worked with in nearly 20 years of advising. Question 1: (Optional) If you have already received your bachelor's degree, please describe what you have been doing since graduation and your plans for the upcoming year. (2000 characters) This is a classic 'gap year' essay topic, frequently used by many medical schools. Essentially, they're asking for a recounting of how you've maintained your interest in medicine and improved upon your qualifications for medical school in a non-academic sense outside of classes. One way to begin answering this question is to start with the facts. What precisely, did you do? What is/was your reasoning behind taking a gap year? What did you achieve? How did your achievements prepare you to succeed in medical school? If you've just graduated and haven't started your gap year yet, how will your plans prepare you for medical school? Here's an example: After receiving my bachelor's in science from Williams College in 2022, I moved to Costa Rica to volunteer my time as an educator for Global Health Volunteers (GHV). The pandemic forced the organization to shift gears in terms of health education, and our primary goal became vaccine education. Every day I helped administer COVID-19 tests and vaccinations to hundreds of patients. As a member of the local academic administration team, I also helped coordinate educational events to inform locals about the importance of COVID testing and inoculation. Although this work provided me with invaluable experience on a technical and administrative level, the personal connections I made with patients will stick with me for the rest of my life. One was Miguel, a 35 year old, former heavy smoker who was deeply conflicted about receiving the vaccination. He was terrified of contracting the virus, but his history of smoking made him reticent about the vaccination as well. I assured him that the vaccine, although it might make him feel sick for a day or two, would not put him in any danger, regardless of his co-morbidities. After extensive conversations, he agreed to the vaccine, and responded very well. Two weeks after becoming inoculated to COVID, Miguel returned to the GHV clinic, this time with a dozen friends and family members. He requested to see me specifically, and I provided vaccines and COVID tests for the entire party. Working with individuals like Miguel has taught me the importance of tailoring care to individuals, as opposed to merely their symptoms or concerns. It is only through developing a relationship with patients that a healthcare provider can truly begin to address their concerns at a deeper level, and thereby form an even more genuine connection with them. For the upcoming year, I will be returning to Costa Rica to continue assisting the local population in the battle against COVID, which is so much more pronounced in developing countries. Why does this response work well? This student comes across as very intentional about how they planned to spend their gap year and specific about what they did. They were able to find a program where they could make an impact in an underserved community and they related the impact they had to the effect on their personal experience and outlook. The student's relationship with Miguel was much more than merely giving a vaccine, it becomes a story where the student learns about the human side of delivering medicine. How to effectively interact with patients is a crucial skill for doctors and not often one taught in a classroom. This highlights to adcoms how the student will bring these lessons and qualities to Johns Hopkins. Question 2: (Optional) If you interrupted your college education for a semester or longer, please describe what you did during that time. (2000 characters) Question 3: Briefly describe your single, most rewarding experience. Feel free to refer to an experience previously described in your AMCAS application. (2500 characters) Question 4: Are there any areas of medicine that are of particular interest to you? If so, please comment. (2500 characters) Question 5: Briefly describe a situation where you had to overcome adversity; include lessons learned and how you think it will affect your career as a future physician. (2500 characters) Question 6: Briefly describe a situation where you were not in the majority. What did you learn from the experience? (2500 characters) Question 7: Wonder encapsulates a feeling of rapt attention ... it draws the observer in. Tell us about a time in recent years that you experienced wonder in your everyday life. Although experiences related to your clinical or research work may be the first to come to mind, we encourage you to think of an experience that is unrelated to medicine or science. What did you learn from that experience? (2500 characters) Question 8: (Optional)The Admissions Committee values hearing about each candidate for admission, including what qualities the candidate might bring to the School of Medicine if admitted. If you feel there is information not already addressed in the application that will enable the Committee to know more about you and this has influenced your desire to be a physician, feel free to write a brief statement in the space below. You may address any subject you wish, such as being a first generation college student, or being a part of a minority group (whether because of your sexual orientation, religion, economic status, gender identity, ethnicity) or being the child of undocumented immigrants or being undocumented yourself, etc. Please note that this question is optional and that you will not be penalized should you choose not to answer it.

How should you prepare? First of all, know that If you've been invited to interview, it means that the admissions committee liked what they saw in your application. You've made it through a significant hurdle in the process. Johns Hopkins uses a traditional [medical school interview](https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-interviews) format so they can see if they like you as much one-on-one as they do on paper. All invited applicants will have two interviews, one with a faculty member and one with a fourth-year medical student. In the 2023-2024 application cycle, interviews are held in-person, but a Skype interview can be requested if an applicant is out of the country. Above all, remember to do your research and prepare responses that are consistent with what you discussed in your application and secondary essays. We find this approach works best in tandem with commonly asked questions at Johns Hopkins. Our research has found the following have been asked recently: What was a mistake you made? Tell me about a time where you worked as a team, and what you learned from it. What can you bring to the table at Johns Hopkins? What are the ethical concerns when prescribing a medication for a homeless man? Why medicine? How would you treat an end-of-life patient? Is the situation of Baltimore (crime reported in media) a detractor? Describe your life in three acts. How could you reconcile different views with another person? How might you answer \"Describe your life in three acts.\" or \"How would you treat an end-of-life patient?\" Make sure you have clear, reasoned responses to questions such as these to give a sense to adcoms that you are certain of your path and purpose. Furthermore, if you were enthusiastic about a particular program or branch of research in your essays, make sure that enthusiasm carries over into your interviews. You should consider when you write your essays and mention certain fields or areas of research whether you would be able to talk about them at length in an interview setting. In other words, pick things that actually interest you so that your answers come across as genuine. Finally, if you have some personal connection to Johns Hopkins, you can elaborate during your interview or the downtime and small talk surrounding your interview. The constraints of the secondary prompts prevent in-depth discussion. Maybe you mentioned this personal connection in one of your essays but didn't really get a chance to explain it fully. The interview process gives you that chance. Final thoughts Applying to medical school can be daunting, and applying to the Johns Hopkins Schools of Medicine, one of the top medical institutions in the world, can seem even more so. Though their expectations are stringent, earning your white coat from Johns Hopkins can be a life-changing experience, one that opens doors and pays lifelong dividends. More importantly, it can give you the opportunity to further the field of medicine, as it has for many other renowned alumni. By emphasizing the qualities that make you a future leader in your essays, you can stand out from the pool of applicants and improve your odds of getting a Johns Hopkins Medical School acceptance.
