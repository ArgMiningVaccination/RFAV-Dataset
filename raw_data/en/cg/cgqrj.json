The pH scale measures the acidity or alkalinity of a substance and ranges from 0 to 14, where 7 is neutral, values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are alkaline. The pH level of healthy skin is slightly acidic, ranging from 4.5 to 5.5. Dr. Nivedita Dadu, Renowned Dermatologist, Founder and Chairman of Dadu Medical Centre explains the term in detail.Why does pH balance matter in skincare? The pH balance of our skin is crucial in maintaining a healthy skin barrier, which protects against environmental pollutants, harmful microorganisms, and water loss. A pH imbalance can disrupt this barrier and lead to several skin issues such as dryness, sensitivity, inflammation, and breakouts. When the skin's pH level is too high or too low, it becomes more susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections, or may cause skin conditions such as acne, eczema, and rosacea.Maintaining the pH balance of our skin is possible with a few simple steps: Use pH-balanced skincare products: Using skincare products that are pH-balanced can help maintain the skin's natural pH level. It's essential to choose products that are specifically designed for your skin type. Different skin types have different pH levels, so it's important to select products that are suitable for your skin. Using products that are too alkaline, such as harsh soaps, can disrupt the skin's pH balance, leading to dryness and irritation. Avoid harsh and alkaline products: Harsh and alkaline products can disrupt the skin's pH balance and lead to skin problems. It's important to avoid using harsh products such as scrubs, astringents, and toners that contain high levels of alcohol or salicylic acid. Instead, opt for gentle cleansers that are pH-balanced. Avoid over-exfoliating: Exfoliating helps to remove dead skin cells and promote cell renewal. However, over-exfoliating can disrupt the skin's natural pH balance, leading to irritation and inflammation. It's best to limit exfoliation to once or twice a week and use a gentle exfoliator. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water can help maintain the skin's natural pH balance. Water helps flush out toxins from the body, leading to healthier-looking skin. Dehydrated skin can appear dull, dry, and flaky, so it's essential to stay hydrated by drinking at least 8-10 glasses of water daily. Maintaining the pH balance of our skin is essential for achieving healthy and beautiful skin. By using pH-balanced skincare products, avoiding harsh and alkaline products, limiting exfoliation, using appropriate cleanser, and staying hydrated, we can maintain the skin's natural pH balance. Paying attention to our skin's pH level and making the necessary changes to our skincare routine can keep our skin looking its best. "}
