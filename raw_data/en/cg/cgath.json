More and more clients are looking for sustainable, natural and organic product options across all consumer goods. Secondly, [hyperpigmented](https://www.skininc.com/treatment/facial/news/21886008/melanin-myths-treating-hyperpigmentation) skin is a concern in every treatment room across the country. Clients request treatments to lighten any sort of hyperpigmentation. Most often, clients turn to more aggressive and chemically laden products that promise instant results. While they're powerful enough to give you those results, they aren't without downsides and long-term effects. Some of them are very harmful to different skin types and skin conditions, and they can often exacerbate the very skin problems you are trying to tackle in the first place. For those clients with [sensitive skin](https://www.skininc.com/treatment/facial/article/21884448/rebuilding-sensitive-skin), these ingredients are not an option and cause sensitivities, redness and [inflammation.](https://www.skininc.com/treatment/facial/article/21879949/calming-the-inflammation-cascade) For those with darker complexions, failing to be cautious of these more aggressive treatments can also cause the skin more hyperpigmentation. Fortunately, there are plenty of natural alternatives to choose from for lightening the skin. 1. Azelaic Acid Azelaic acid is a natural skin lightening agent derived from wheat, rye and barley. This acid has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, and it helps to lighten the skin by inhibiting melanin production and suppressing the growth of melanin producing cells. It can help with skin blemishes and fade dark spots left behind by acne, [sun damage](https://www.skininc.com/treatment/sun-care/article/21881831/7-sun-protection-myths-exposed) or melasma. Azelaic acid also helps to treat [rosacea](https://www.skininc.com/treatment/medspa/news/21887062/the-road-to-relief-common-treatments-for-rosacea), redness, skin irritations, acne and reduce inflammation.

Bearberry Extract Bearberry extract is derived from the bearberry plant containing high concentrations of [antioxidants ](https://www.skininc.com/science/ingredients/article/22250023/antioxidants-for-all-skin)and arbutin, a skin-lightening compound. The arbutin found in bearberry is what gives this extract its skin lightening properties. Arbutin is a natural derivative of hydroquinone, providing similar effects without the risks or skin reactions. Bearberry extract reduces melanin synthesis by inhibiting tyrosinase. Bearberry is great at correcting dark spots, hyperpigmentation, scars and it contains sun protection filters, which can reduce the impact of sun exposure and help slow down the signs of [aging.](https://www.skininc.com/treatment/facial/article/21977584/protocols-in-practice-antiaging) 3. Citrus Extract Citrus extracts are derived from citrus fruits such as grapefruit, lemon, lime, pomelo and orange, and it is a source of vitamin P (bioflavonoids) and vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Vitamin C, the hero element, helps to neutralize free radicals, which can cause premature aging of the skin. It is a potent agent that helps to minimize skin damage, build [collagen](https://www.skininc.com/science/ingredients/news/21889228/collagen-and-soy-peptides-stimulate-collagen) and elastin, reduce melanin production, as well as promote skin [peeling ](https://www.skininc.com/treatment/facial/article/21879528/protocols-in-practice-8-peel-protocols-for-your-spa)and skin growth. Citric acid helps with the skin lightening mechanism by reducing the cohesion of the cells on the epidermal surface, helping to stimulate cell turnover and renewal.
