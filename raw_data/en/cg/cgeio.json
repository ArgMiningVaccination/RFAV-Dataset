Recent negative COVID tests will not be accepted. Designer and stylist Jillian Cainghug brings together her interest in contemporary design with traditional Filipino cultural rituals to present a program that embodies design, community, celebration and tradition. Join us as we come together and witness traditional Filipino practices being utilized in contemporary ways\u2014with the traditional Binakol weave as a basis for the evening's program. Binakol is a traditional weaving pattern indigenous to the northern region of the Philippines, pre-dating Spanish colonization. The geometric designed weaves were originally used to confuse and ward off negative spirits\u2014their irregular patterns creating dizzying effects, while simultaneously creating harmony and peace within the design itself. To this day, this practice is symbolic of creation, protection, community and peace. Expect to see demonstrations on Kali, a Filipino traditional form of combat; Ablon, a form of physical manual medicine; experience sound healing and the Kulintang, a gong instrument being played in celebration of it all. Kali practitioner Imee Dalton, certified Ablon practitioner Isaac Castro, sound healer/master Janelle Corpuz Hethcoat, local NELA musician/producer Gingee, and visual artist Nicanor Evans will be co-facilitating with Cainghug throughout the evening. Audience participation is encouraged! While all these practices, backgrounds and people stem from different parts of the Philippines and the US, Cainghug sees and experiences all of the elements together in connection, as one, as Kapwa*. *Kapwa - Tagalog term for same, equal connected to one another.
