Formal Request for Proposals (RFPs) regarding this announcement will not be issued. 1.2 BAA Open Period This BAA will remain open from 18 July 2016 through 30 September 2016, 1400 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) . Phase I Proposals must be received by this time and date in order to be considered. Submission inform ation is provided in Section 3.3 of this BAA. 1.3 Research Opportunity Description The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Chemical and Biological Technologies (CBT) were established by the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide state -of-the-art defense capabilities to allow military forces of the United States to operate and to succe ssfully complete their missions in chemical and biological warfare environments. The scope of mission efforts and the priorities assigned to specific projects are influenced by changes in military and civilian Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) science and technology, advanced developments, operational requirements, military threat assessments, and national defense strategies. To keep pace with defense c apability requirements, the CBD as part of its mission, routinely promulgates chemical and biologica l research. The comprehensive research program encompasses both intramural and extramural sources, and the role of each is vital to the fulfillment of the Program objectives. DTRA is seeking optimum approaches to meet technology objectives within the areas listed below , with a goal to identify and select science and technology projects that can be transitioned to joint acquisition program s: 1. Detection - Chemical and Biological: The goal of the Detection area is to provide real - time capability to dete ct, identify, characterize, locate and warn against all known or validated CB warfare agents in addition to other chemical or biological threat materials (e.g., Toxic Industrial Chemicals). 2. Information Systems Capability Development: The goal of the Information Systems Capability Development area is to provide information technology superiority with respect to the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) environment. 3. Protection - Individual and Collective: The Prot ection Capability Area seeks to provide unencumbered full -dimensional protection to the war fighter for both personal protective gear (individual protection) and protection of large scale fixed or mobile environments (collective protection). 4. Hazard Miti gation: The goal of the Hazard Mitigation Capability Area is to develop 2 technologies that can rapidly restore pre -contamination capabilities with a minimum of logistical impact. 5. Threat Agent Science: The Threat Agent Science Capability Area s eeks to ma intain and develop scientific knowledge of current, non -traditional, and emerging threats in addition to studying areas such as low level toxicity, agent fate, and improved simulant materials. 6. Medical Pretreatments: The goal of the Pretreatments Capabi lity Area is to conduct research in order to develop lead candidate vaccines and chemical pretreatments and protectants that can be administered before exposure to provide both specific and broad - spectrum protection against validated chemical or biological agents. Categories of threat agents addressed in this capability area include nerve agents, viruses, bacteria and toxins. 7. Medical Diagnostics: Medical diagnostics involves the diagnosis of infection by or exposure to bacterial, viral, or toxin agents (biological diagnostics) or of exposure to nerve, vesicant, respiratory and blood agents (chemical diagnostics) with the goal to rapidly identify the causative agent in a remote environment prior to onset of symptoms. 8. Medical Therapeutics: The goal of the Therapeutics Capability Area is to develop lead candidate medical treatments and pharmaceuticals that, when administered after exposure to a chemical or biological agent, mitigate or curtail the effects of that exposure and sustain forces operating in a CBW hazard area. Medical Therapeutics is segregated into biological countermeasures and chemical countermeasures. 9. Threat Surveillance - Chemical and Biological : The goal of the Threat Surveillance area is to deliver cutting edge Integrated Early Warning, Information Management and Applied Analytic capabilities to the warfighter; virtually connect them to these capabilities and other system users for rapid situational awareness, course of action (CoA) analysis and decision support. 1.4 BAA Process This BAA will utilize a two-step process, consisting of the submission and evaluation of Phase I (White Paper Packages) and Phase II (Full) proposals. While all interested parties may submit Phase I proposals, submission of Phase II proposals will be by inv itation only. The evaluation status of Phase I and Phase II proposals will be provided at two points. An email will be sent to each Offeror after completion of White Paper package evaluations. The email will either inform the Offeror that their Phase I proposal is no longer under consideration, or it will provide instructions for the submission of a Phase II proposal. In a similar manner, Offerors that submit a Phase II proposal will receive an email informing them that their proposal is either no lon ger under consideration or has been selected for award pending successful price negotiations. 1.5 Award Vehicle A full range of flexible acquisition related statutory authority arrangements available to DTRA are possible results from this announcement, inclu ding but not limited to, Contracts, Task Orders, and Other Transaction Agreements (OTA) . The G overnment does not intend to award grants or Cooperative agreements under this solicitation . Each of these 3 procurement instruments offers different advantages, liabilities and responsibilities for Offerors and the Government. Except for OTAs , the Government actions under this BAA shall adhere to the requirements of the FAR and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) . 1.5.1 Contract Type The Government intends to award Cost and Cost -Plus-Fixed -Fee (CPFF) contracts and, when in the Government's best interest, Fixed -Price contracts. Research and Development contracts are typically Cost -Reimbursement (Cost, CPFF) contracts. In accordance wi th FAR 16.301 -3(a)(3), Cost -Reimbursement contracts require that the contractor's accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. Determinations of accounting system inadequacy, or lack of evidence to support a determinatio n of accounting system adequacy, will preclude the Offeror from receiving a contract. The Government will typically rely on the findings of a DCAA accounting system audit in making a determination of accounting system adequacy. 1.5.2 Limitation on OTA s Offeror s are advised that an OTA may only be awarded if it meets one of the following criteria: a. There is at least one nontraditional defense contractor participating to a significant extent in the prototype project, or b. All significant participants in the transac tion other than Federal Government are small business or non -traditional defense contractors, or c. At least one third of the total cost of the prototype projects is to be paid out of funds provided by parties to the transaction other than the Federal Govern ment. d. The senior procurement executive for the agency determined in writing that exceptional circumstances justify the use of a transaction that provides for innovative business arrangements or structures that would not be feasible or appropriate under a contract, or would provide an opportunity to expand the defense supply base in a manner that would not be practical or feasible under a contract. For purposes of determining whether or not a participant may be classified as a nontraditional defense contra ctor or small business and whether or not such participation is determined to be participating to a significant extent in the prototype project, the following definitions are applicable: \"Nontraditional defense contractor \" means an entity that is not currently performing and has not performed, for at least the one -year period preceding the solicitation of sources by the Department of Defense for the procurement or transaction, any contract or subcontract for the Department of Defense that is subject to full coverage under the cost accounting standards prescribed pursuant to section 1502 of title 41 and the regulations implementing such section. 4 \"Small Business \" means a small business concern as defined under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S. C. 632). \"Participating to a significant extent in the prototype project \" means that the nontraditional defense contractor or small business is supplying a new key technology or product, is accomplishing a significant amount of the effort wherein the role played is more than a nominal or token role in the research effort, or in some other way plays a significant part in causing a material reduction in the cost or schedule of the effort or an increase in performance of the prototype in question. NOTE: Offerors are cautioned that if they propose the use of an OTA, the Government reserves the right to negotiate either a FAR based procurement contract, or OTA as it deems is warranted under the circumstances. 1.5.3 Contract Period of Performance Limitation In accor dance with FAR 17.204(e), contract periods of performance shall be limited to a maximum of five years, inclusive of all Options. 1.6 Points of Contact E-mail address for all BAA correspondence and questions Dtra.belvoir.J9.mbx.CB -BAA@mail.mil BAA Announcements posted in Federal Business Opportunities, FedBizOpps http://www.fbo.gov DTRA Proposal Submission Website (requires registration prior to proposal submission) http://www.dtrasubmission.net DTRA Website http://www.dtra.mil 1.7 Technical and Administrative Support by Non-Government Personnel It is the intent of DTRA to use non -government personnel (e.g. contractor support personnel) in the review and administration of all submittals (Phase I and Phase II) for this BAA. Participation in the BAA requires the following DTRA Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) support contractor employees, contracted contract specialist support and proposal submission website support to have access to proposal information including information that may be considered proprietary : Engi lity Corporation; JAB Solutions, LLC; and SBG Technology Solutions, Inc. The contracts for provision of support personnel contain Organizational Conflict of Interest provisions and include contractual requirements for non - disclosure of proprietary contrac tor information. Additionally, Engility employees in their role as an A&AS support contractor to DTRA will provide technical input in an advisory role as subject matter experts (SMEs) to the Government reviewers in addition to providing administrative sup port in the management of the proposals and their technical review. Phase II proposals, in some instances, may require other non -government personnel from Academia to serve as peer reviewers with access to proposal information including 5 information that may be considered proprietary. All individuals in these categories having access to any proprietary data shall execute nondisclosure agreements certifying that they will not disclose any information pertaining to this solicitation including any proposal submittals, the identity of any submitters, or any other information relative to the Offeror's proposal. All Offerors to this BAA consent to the disclosure of their information to th e aforementioned companies, their subcontractors, and Academia peer rev iewers under these conditions. 1.8 Freedom of Information Act Disclosure In the event that properly marked data contained in a Phase I or II proposal submitted in response to this BAA is requested pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC 552, the Of feror will be advised of such request and, prior to such release of information, will be requested to expeditiously submit to DTRA a detailed listing of all information in the white paper/proposal which the Offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure und er the Act. Such action and cooperation on the part of the Offeror will ensure that any information released by DTRA pursuant to the Act is properly identified. 2.0 Eligibility Except as specified below, t his BAA is open to all responsible sources capable of responding to the Government's requirements .

Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, technical requirements, and proposal content and format requirements . Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Additionally, Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. It is the O fferor's responsibility to ensure the completeness of the proposal. Evaluation of a proposal will be conducted only on the basis of the information contained within it and the Gove rnment will not assume that an O fferor possesses any capabilities not speci fied. Proposal s shall be clear, concise, and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. The O fferor shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of the Offeror's capabilities . 3.1 Adm inistrative Requirements 3.1.1 Registration to the DTRA Proposal Submission Website All Offerors are required to register at the DTRA proposal submission website prior to submission of Phase I proposals. Detailed registration and submission instructions are available at the site. The registration must be submitted by a central Business Point of Contact (BPOC) rather than individual Principal Investigator personnel. A BPOC is a person who is given the responsibility of coordinating all submissions from indiv idual Principal Investigators at his or her work location and is the only individual who may access the DTRA proposal submission website. The intent is that all submissions from an organization be coordinated and submitted by a single, identified responsi ble party. Failure to register in accordance with instructions may render them ineligible for participation in this BAA. Offerors must be aware that it is their responsibility to ensure that e -mail notifications reach the designated BPOC and that e -mail notifications are not blocked due to the use of 'spam blocker' software or other means that the recipient's Internet Service Provider may have implemented as a means to block the receipt of certain e -mail messages. Additionally, it is the responsibility of the BPOC to inform DTRA of any updates to e - mail addresses for both themselves as the registered BPOC and for the designated Principal Investigator. 7 IMPORTANT : Registration at the DTRA proposal submission website is NOT the same as registering at the System for Award Management or FedBizOpps websites. Failure to register at the DTRA proposal submission website will prevent an Offeror's submission of documents required and thus render the Offeror ineligible for participation in this BAA. 3.1.2 Registration to the System for Award Management (SAM) Website DTRA requires that all Offerors be registered in the SAM database at the time of Phase I proposal submission. Contractors must keep their registration current for the life of the contract. Offerors may r egister with SAM online at http://www.sam.gov . Offerors will NOT be able to complete their SAM registration until SAM has confirmed the Offeror's Employer Identification Number (EIN) or Taxpayer Identification Number (T IN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). NOTE: It will take 24 -48 hours for the IRS to validate the TIN. According to the IRS, if Offerors do not currently have an EIN and need to apply for one over the phone or Internet, they will be given a tentati ve EIN, but the EIN may not become active for up to two (2) weeks. Questions regarding an EIN may be directed at 1 -800-829-4933. 3.2 Questions about this BAA Questions regarding the technical and administrative content of this BAA must be sent to the followi ng DTRA e -mail address: Dtra.belvoir.J9.mbx.CB -BAA@mail.mil . Questions and/or inquiries that are not submitted to the aforementioned e -mail address will be disregarded. All questions must include the BAA number in the subject line. DTRA will post answers to questions on the FedBizOpps website. It is the Offeror's responsibility to periodically check the FedBizOpps website to view postings of questions and answers, in ad dition to any applicable amendments to the BAA. 3.3 Proposal Submission Instructions 3.3.1 General Instructions All proposals must be submitted electronically through the DTRA proposal submission website: http://www .dtrasubmission.net . Any proposal submitted by any means other than the DTRA proposal submission website will not be considered (e.g., hand -carried, postal service, commercial carrier, e -mail). Offerors are responsible for ensuring submission of their Phase I proposals by the date and time specified in Section 1.2. Time management is wholly the responsibility of the Offeror. If a timely submission is not fully uploaded prior to the cutoff date/time, the proposal will not be considered. No exception s will be made. The Offeror must verify the submission of their proposal package by printing the electronic receipt (time and date stamped) that appears on the final screen following compliant submission of a proposal to the DTRA proposal submission websi te. 8 Using the DTRA proposal submission website, all Offerors must prepare Proposal Cover Sheets for each Phase I and invited Phase II proposal submitted. All data point requirements must be completed in every cover sheet. Once the cover sheet is saved, the system will assign a unique proposal number for each Phase I submission and a different unique proposal number for each invited Phase II submission. Cover sheets may be edited as often as necessary until the submission period closes. All submissions must be dated and unclassified . If multiple proposals are being submitted by the same Offeror in response to different Topic Areas, separate cover sheets must be generated for each proposal and the full proposal files must be uploaded with the associate d cover sheet, since a unique document number will automatically be assigned to each submission by the electronic proposal tracking system. All documents submitted to the DTRA proposal submission website are considered works in progress and are not eligib le for evaluation until the Offeror submits the final proposal package for consideration. Once all proposal files have been uploaded and the Offeror is ready to submit their application, select the green \"Submit\" button on the page. A confirmation message will appear on the page once the submission has gone through. Perform a virus check before uploading any proposal files. If a virus is detected, it may cause rejection of the file. Offerors must submit proposals to the appropriate Topic. Failure to do so will render the proposal ineligible for evaluation and award. 3.3.2 Late Submissions and Withdrawal of Proposals Offerors are responsible for access to the DTRA proposal submission website and for submitting electronic proposals so as to be received at the Government site indicated in this BAA no later than the closing date and time stated in Section 1.2, above . Untimely proposals will not be considered. When sending electronic files, the Offeror wi ll account for potential delays in file transfer from the originator's computer server to the Government website/computer server. Offerors are encouraged to submit their proposals early to avoid potential file transfer delays due to high demand or problem s encountered in the course of the submission. Offerors should also print, and maintain for their records, the electronic date/time stamped receipt that appears on the final screen following submission of a proposal on the DTRA proposal submission website . All submissions shall be fully uploaded before the cut off time/date in order to be considered. Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award.

The intent of these topics is to identify technologies that fill identified capability needs in the DoD Chemical and Biological Defense Program. The level of detail provided for each specific technology area and sub -area or order in which they appear is not intended to convey any information regarding relative priority. This BAA is limited to projects that meet Technology Readiness Level (TRL) definitions in the TRL range 3 -6. Upon completion of proposed development efforts, solutions should strive to meet a TRL in the range of 4 -6. Proposals that address technologies at TRL 4 o r greater should also be aware of the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) considerations. Topic: CBA -01 Challenging Agents by Novel Diagnostic Orthogonal (CANDO) Technology Program Background : A myriad of bacterial and viral pathogens may manifest as severe acute systemic febrile illness with nonspecific symptoms. These pathogens are both extremely difficult to diagnose and self -limited in duration; lasting in the bloodstream for only a few days to weeks. Diagnosing these illnesses can be challenging and usually requires a high index of suspicion and clinical awareness. Several of the serious and potentially life threatening infections include brucellosis1, epidemic typhus2 and viral encephalitis3. In fact, limited data is available to support a diagno stic approach for viral encephalitis caused by Eastern, Western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. Many non -human primate (NHP) animal studies have shown that viremia is short -lived with variability in viral load. Previously developed real -time p olymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic assays 26 (amplification of pathogen target genes) for both brucellosis and epidemic typhus were terminated due to multi -center clinical trial performance below acceptance criteria. Objective : This topic seeks propo sals to deliver clinically relevant and diagnostically informative approaches for developing signatures and/or tests to identify and diagnosis severe acute systemic febrile illness caused virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Enhancements over the current state of diagnostics for these pathogens are required. Analyte discovery efforts must be accompanied by studies to verify the diagnostic window and parameters of the analyte (i.e., appropriate body fluid /clinical sample matrix , time post -exposure , etc.) in relevant animal models. This topic will ultimately support the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) Joint Project Management Office for Me dical Countermeasure Systems (MCS) Diagnostics program to develop diagnostic tests for acute brucellosis, epidemic typhus and arboviral encephalitis. The goal is d iscovery and verification of diagnostic window and parameters of novel circulating analytes for diagnosis of acute brucellosis, epidemic typhus and arboviral encephalitis. Single or multiple approaches with accompanying diagnostic algorithm for each causative agent may be submitted; however, higher priority will be given to proposals that address more than one of the pathogens. Science and Technology Needs: research should focus on answering the following knowledge gaps with the listed considerations. Analyte(s) Identification: define the appropriate analytes that can be targeted as an indication of the corresponding clinical disease. Analytes are preferably pathogen derived, highly specific to the causative agent, and detectable by nucleic acid amplification or affinity techniques. Host -based markers should be included only by exception due to validation challenges and an unclear pathway to regulatory clearance in the near - to mid -term (2 -5 years). o Serological (antibody capture) methods must be developed and validated against well -characterized serum sample panels with relevant representation of pathogen species (sero -positivity and negativity), immunoglobulin class (IgM, IgG), titer, clinical, geographical metadata, etc. o DNA methods that target multiple or enhanced genetic element signatures, improved amplification and extraction effici ency though primer design and probe chemistry, extended and re -optimized cycling protocols, and/or ultrasensitive amplicon detection modality are examples of approaches that may address challenges. o Antigen capture immunoassays should focus on secreted, cir culating and in vivo amplified bacterial pathogen antigen biomarkers. o Assay validation test plan must be presented for high TRL (5) proposed analyte tests. Clinical Matrix Identification: define the matrix or matrices where the analytes reproducibly accum ulate to detectable levels during clinical disease. Non - (or minimally) invasive specimen matrices for measuring analytes are encouraged. Clinical matrices that are compatible with Army medical role 3 collection capabilities 27 would be the minimum standard for consideration (urine, whole blood, serum, sputum, nasopharyngeal swab). Diagnostic Window: define the time period when the analytes accumulate to detectable levels in the clinical matrix. Additional information that defines the expected analyte concen tration in each matrix will inform the appropriate detection platform based on analytical capabilities (e.g. LFI, immunoassay instrument, etc.). The analytes would preferably be detectable within 7 days of symptom onset as this would align with a role 3 d iagnostic as it relates to patient movement within the military medical roles of care. Offerors are encouraged to develop R&D collaborations with other organizations in Government, academia, and the private sector to broaden and strengthen their knowledge, experience and capabilities. Additionally, offerors are encouraged to take advantage of specialized resources in the DoD and other Government agencies such as facilities/capabilities. References : 1. Pappas G, et al. 2005.

Veterinary Microbiology Topic: CBA -02 Field Assays for Chemical Weapons Exposure Background : Current methods for determination of human exposure to chemical warfare agents (CWAs) are limited, in that they rely upon visible signs and symptoms, inference from detection of the agent itself out side of the body, or lab -based mass spectrometric methods. The only current FDA -approved assay for determining chemical warfare agent exposure in the field is the Test -mate ChE Cholinesterase Test System [1] (a CLIA moderate complexity test based on the E llman assay), which is approved for cholinesterase level measurement from fresh whole blood, derived from a 4 -microliter finger stick and with a 4 -min time to result. However, there are a variety of limitations of this assay. For example, the assay has a narrow operational temperature range, no data export capability, no controls, and a poor negative predictive value. Moreover, the assay's reliance upon a single exposure biomarker gives it an inability to distinguish between various possible CWAs which w ould call for variations in countermeasure responses. Recent agent - and host -based signatures of exposure to nerve agents and other CWAs of current concern [2 -6], together with the possibility of modifying assays under development for drugs of abuse [7] and adopting a multiplexed format with the potential ability to perform semi -continuous communication of assay results, offers the potential to address the inherent limitations of the Test -mate system. Coupling known biomarkers and recent assay developme nts will provide the warfighter with the ability to rapidly assess, in the field, whether exposure to a CWA has occurred and to achieve greater resolution as to the nature of the insulting agent and therefore the proper tactical and medical response, withi n specific military scenarios. 28 Objective : This topic seeks proposals that leverage known biomarkers of exposure to CWAs into assays for employment in any of the following contexts: (a) minimally invasive assays for high levels of exposure to long latency cholinesterase -inhibiting agents for whic h medical intervention could change the outcome; (b) low burden trigger to treat for presumptively exposed personnel without objective signs of exposure in high threat scenarios; or (c) high level exposures to long latency cholinesterase -inhibiting agents for which medical intervention could change the outcome. Assays should be applicable to multiple CWAs of current concern. The goal is to develop low -cost, FDA -cleared assays applicable to determining exposure to chemical warfare agents in a battlefield set ting. This topic will ultimately support the JPEO MCS Diagnostics program to develop field diagnostic tests for chemical warfare agents. Offerors shall address the following in their technical approach: A clear roadmap to FDA approval of a field assay f or CWAs with 7 years, with clearly defined and measureable quantitative go/no -go decision points subject to validation by government -defined entities external to the performing team. Articulate consideration of how the assay would be applied within a fie ld setting relevant to one or multiple of the contexts described above, including realistic limitations of such application(s). A robust plan for translation from appropriate in vitro and in vivo models to human relevance, as well as translation from any e xperiments which may initially employ chemical warfare agent simulants to those which employ the actual agents at appropriate facilities. A plan and appropriate partnerships to enable translation of successfully demonstrated assays to either current comm ercial platforms [8 -10] or new platforms which will be commercialized. This topic is NOT seeking efforts which are focused purely on: new biomarker discovery, laboratory -based analysis or forensics methods, or computational modeling. Offerors are encourag ed to develop R&D collaborations with other organizations in Government, academia, and the private sector to broaden and strengthen their knowledge, experience and capabilities. Additionally, offerors are encouraged to take advantage of specialized resourc es in the DoD and other Government agencies such as facilities/capabilities.

Topic: CBS -01 Development of New Platform Technology for Nerve Agent Prophylaxis Background: The human body employs a wide variety of mechanisms in o rder to partially protect itself from the adverse effects of inhaled or absorbed toxicants. These interconnected mechanisms range, for example, from selective barriers such as the skin and various endothelial and epithelial partitions, to membrane efflux p umps, scavenging or catalyzing 32 proteins, radical scavengers, immune -mediated responses, and metabolic and excretion processes. However, since the body has only a limited capability to respond to extremely deadly toxicants such as chemical warfare agents ( CWA), the Chemical and Biological Defense Program is pursuing the development of enhanced prophylaxis by modulation of one or more of these mechanisms in order to provide greater protection. In this vein, for example, it is known that natural variations a mong individuals and populations can lead to significant and measureable differences in the response to pharmaceuticals and toxicants of various classes. These variations can be due to genetic or environmental influences. In certain cases the specific ph enotypic and genotypic loci contributing to such natural variation in the human host response to xenobiotics have been characterized. [1 -6] As just one example, certain healthy human populations have a genetic variation, \"Cynthiana variant,\" [7, 8] a condi tion of 2 -3 fold increased levels of plasma butyrylcholinesterase, which leads to a lowered efficacy of certain drugs and toxicants that act at the nerve synapse. Novel approaches to prophylaxis against CWA could be envisioned to focus on upregulating or otherwise modulating such natural resistance mechanisms to offer systemic protection to exposed individuals. When coupled with careful consideration of appropriate targeting modalities [9, 10] as well as drug delivery methods relevant to military operat ions in chemically contaminated environments, the potential exists for breakthrough approaches to new FDA -approved prophylactics to CWA. Appropriate exploitation of such relevant in vivo response pathways could address several of the limitations inherent in current work that relies upon exogenously -derived countermeasures, including problematic immunogenicity and bioavailability. Objective: This topic seeks proposals to develop and advance physiological production and distribution of prophylactic medical countermeasures against chemical weapons of mass destruction. The aim of this topic is to ultimately provide the warfighter with increased protection, survival, reduced morbidity, and greater ability to operate in contaminated environments without complex pre-mission preparation. It is further envisioned that the developed prophylactic, whether based on modulation of endogenous protein expression or other innate protective responses, will ultimately be FDA approved. This topic is specifically focused on n ew platform approaches which have the potential for high impact on the military's ability to function in environments contaminated with nerve agents, via breakthroughs in relevant prophylactics. Innovative approaches are desired which induce or enhance the body's innate ability to respond to systemic exposure to nerve agents. Protective efficacy against 2 -5 times the LD 50 for an exposure modality relevant to military operations must be demonstra ted. In addition, prophylaxis must be fully effective within three days of the initiation of the protective measure and must persist for at least ten days. Offerors shall demonstrate an understanding of how the prophylactic could be effectively administe red in a military setting. Offerors shall outline a clearly defined regulatory pathway to FDA approval within 8 years, including clearly defined steps and measureable quantitative go/no -go decision 33 points subject to validation by government -defined entities external to the performing team. Offerors shall present a robust plan for translation from pharmacologically -relevant animal models to effects in humans, as well as translation from experiments which may initially employ nerve agent simulants to experiments which employ the actual agents at appropriate facilities. Offerors shall outline appropriate pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, absorption - distribution -metabolism -excretion (ADME), toxicity a nd mechanism of action studies to support regulatory requirements. In addition, offerors shall describe relevant biomarkers associated with their approach and the status of required assays, in terms of whether they are validated, in development, or propo sed. The maturity of supporting synthetic activities should also be described, together with an estimate of scale -up costs which may ultimately be required. Activities which will require subcontracts must be detailed together with contingency plans to mi tigate risk. Note that this topic is NOT seeking traditional drug discovery approaches which rely heavily upon computational methods, high throughput compound screening, or repackaging of approved countermeasure pharmaceuticals. The topic is also NOT see king approaches already in discussion with the FDA in an Investigational New Drug (IND) context. Funding Profile: Proposals are sought for projects with a funding level of $0.5 -1.3M per year, with a one -year base period and up to four additional option ye ars. References: 1. M.

Topic: CBS -02 Computational Rapid Identification & Scientific Threat AnaLysis (CRISTAL) Background: Currently, there are many different software tools that have not been applied to the DoD's need to assess a compound's \"potential to cause acute, debilitating toxicity.\" Some of these models might provide a valuable backbone for predicting physicochemica l properties, environmental fate and acute toxicity. Many commercial models have been designed for pharmaceutical use in terms of structure -activity prediction, physiologically - based pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, different products have been develope d (government and commercial) to forecast physicochemical properties from molecular structure or to utilize fundamental experimental data to determine likely agent fate parameters. These models have all been developed for specific uses, but do not \"talk\" to each other to create a chemical characterization continuum. Upon receipt of \" Application of Modern Toxicology Approaches for Predicting Acute Toxicity for Chemical Defense,\"(1) the Threat Agent Science (TAS) Program began an analysis of its current pro gram to find where efficiencies could be gained, as well as where in silico approaches were already being employed. Through that analysis, many programs that look into physical, chemical and toxicological properties, as well as environmental agent fate, w ere identified as intrinsic components to the existing experimental program. These include: ACD Labs EPI Suite (EPA) GEO Pearl Pesticide fate model EFAST: Exposure and Fate Assessment Screening Tool (EPA) Simulations Plus ADMET Predictor Simulations Plu s Gastroplus Simulations Plus MedChem Designer Simulations Plus MedChem Studio Other commercial and government modeling software tools that predict chemical or particle behavior or environmental and physiological response. In addition to the programs list ed above, \"ChemDraw\" is used by many chemists and toxicologists in initial design and analysis of chemicals, though many of the current computational tools will not import chemical structures from that software to use as a starting point. Ultimately, the c apability should have multiple points for insertion and extraction of information. A \"smart system\" that is flexible enough to take in multiple streams of data in and extrapolate to useful endpoints. In order to be successful, CRISTAL requires a combination of technical areas to ensure a comprehensive look at the problem which includes: physicochemical properties, chemical 35 disposition and metabolism, through acute toxicity predictions. A successful ap proach will require validation steps with available in vitro and in vivo data to support model reliability. The components of CRISTAL are not independent, or even linear, but parts of an integrated capability. The system needs to be able to coordinate be tween and around these disparate datastreams in a way that provides access to critical information that can inform decision makers and countermeasure developers in a timely fashion. CRISTAL is divided into many parts: 1. Development of computational tools t o predict physicochemical properties, acute systemic toxicity and/or environmental fate; 2. Development of medium - to high -throughput laboratory approaches to predict: a. laboratory animal and/or human in vivo acute toxicity of chemical threat agents and verify fidelity of computations and b. environmental agent fate in a variety of operationally relevant matrices (soils, grasses, asphalt, concrete, etc.) of chemical threat agents and verify fidelity of computati ons; and 3. Development of a tool to integrate currently used computational models and databases. Part 1: Includes but is not limited to the development of computational tools to predict properties and fate for a broad range of chemicals. (Proposals are no t currently being solicited for Part 1 of CRISTAL.) A. Initial characterization of physicochemical properties along with in-silico approaches such as: a. Structure -activity relationship (SAR) b. Quantitative structure -property relationship (QSPR) (2) c. Quantitative structure -activity relationship (QSAR) (3) d. category and analogue approaches where prediction can extend to chemical families B. Initial prediction of chemical disposition and metabolism Objective: There is a need for development and integration of \"non -testing approaches\" that bring together multiple property evaluations and toxicity factors to enhance predictive characterization, environmental fate and toxicology for chemical threat agents. This area will seek to integrate disparate areas and fill identifie d gaps in computational and in vitro , ex vivo , non-mammalian, and non -vertebrate evaluation of potential threat agents and their activity on or in the human. This topic seeks proposals for Parts 2 and 3 of CRISTAL as reflected below. Part 2: Development of medium - to high -throughput laboratory approaches to predict acute systemic toxicity and/or environmental agent fate. (Multiple proposals are being solicited in this area. Multiple awards are anticipated. Awards are expected range between $250,000.00 and $2,000,000.00) 36 A. Development of medium - to high -throughput laboratory approaches to predict acute systemic toxicity in laboratory animals and/or humans of chemical threat agents for operationally relevant routes of exposure (ocular, inhalation (nose -only and whole - body) and dermal) and verify fidelity of computations. Any effort proposed against this area MUST demonstrate the ability to place known organophosphate -, organphosphonate - and carbamate -pesticides, as well as G - and V -type chemical warfare agents in appropriate order of human systemic toxicity by one or more operationally relevant routes of exposure. Preference will be given to those approaches that can accomplish both \"a\" and \"d\" below. a. In vitro , ex vivo, non-mammalian, and/or non -vertebrate experimental approaches to increase throughput b. Absorption and deposition (noting differences between oral, dermal, inhalational routes of exposure) c. Metabolism d. In vitro , ex vivo, non-mammalian, and/or non -vertebrate experimental approaches to asses s volatile chemicals B. Development of medium - to high -throughput laboratory approaches to predict environmental agent fate in a variety of operationally relevant matrices (soils, grasses, asphalt, concrete, etc.) of chemical threat agents and verify fidelity of computations and provide information that is otherwise unavailable. The product would include properties and outputs suitable for operational modeling parameters (such as JEM, JWARN, HPAC). a. Physical Properties such as vapor pressure, viscosity, surface tension, density b. Partitioning between aqueous, organic and vapor phases, dissociation constants. c. Aqueous and thermal stability, sorption and interaction with operationally relevant matrices under operationally relevant conditions. Part 3: Development of a tool to integrate existing computational tools and databases with flexibility to add components as identified or developed. (Multiple proposals are being solicited in this area. Multiple awards are anticipated. Awards are expected range between $250,0 00.00 and $1,200,000.00) Tools and databases to be included in the initial integration include: ACD Labs EPI Suite (EPA) GEO Pearl Pesticide Fate Model EFAST: Exposure and Fate Assessment Screening Tool (EPA) Simulations Plus ADMET Predictor Simulations Plus Gastroplus Other commercial and government modeling software tools that predict chemical or particle behavior or environmental and physiological response. In addition to the tool, it should be able to take output from \"ChemDraw,\"as well as the SMILES string, and be able to incorporate that into the above computational tools. 37 DTRA Threat Agent Science is seeking proposals for the areas specified above including: Development of medium - to high -throughput laboratory approaches for predicting acut e systemic toxicity; Development of medium - to high -throughput laboratory approaches for predicting environmental fate; and/or Development of a tool to integrate the data from the laboratory methods and all of the multiple computation predictive tools that CRISTAL currently uses.

Washington, DC: The -Generation Prophylaxis Technologies Background: There continues to be significant strides towar d the development of rapid production platform prophylaxis technologies that launch prophylaxis medical countermeasures against emerging and unanticipated threat agents. A goal of platform prophylaxis technologies is to reduce risk and shorten the timeline of prophylaxis conception through clinical use. To achieve this goal, it is desirable to identify strategies that minimize the technological requirements for effective development of a desired prophylaxis. The platform prophylaxis technologie s applicabl e to this topic are: Inactivated virus/bacterial vaccine production systems Bacterial polysaccharide production systems Monoclonal antibodies that prevent infectious diseases Aptamers Novel scavenger technologies Novel platform production technologies (excluding viral, bacterial and bacteriophage vectors, and nucleic acid vaccines). Objective: This topic seeks proposals that will assess the feasibility of rapid production platforms for biological prophylaxis that ultimately could be used to protect the Warfighter from biological threat agents. This topic supports the Chemical and Biological Defense Program's modernization goals by developing next -generation platform technologies for rapid production of biological prophylaxis. The o bjectives of this to pic are to: Support the development of platform prophylaxis technologies that fall into the following categories: o Inactivated virus/bacterial vaccine production systems 38 o Bacterial polysaccharide production systems o Monoclonal antibodies that prevent infectio us diseases o Aptamers o Novel scavenger technologies o Novel platform production technologies (excluding plants production, viral, bacterial and bacteriophage vectors, and nucleic acid vaccines). Exclude platform prophylaxis technologies containing components that invoke immunity which interferes with subsequent applications of the platform prophylaxis technology, such as targeting a second indication. Assess the utility of platform production technologies toward the development of a prophylaxis against one or more of the following: o Burkholderia Machupo virus (MACV)) o Biological toxins, with the priority being marine toxins. The desired attributes of the platform prophylaxis production system are as follows: Offerors developing inactivated virus/bacterial vaccine production systems shall include plans to formulate the vaccine w ith an adjuvant that will minimize the primary series dose amount and number requirement. Offerors developing bacterial polysaccharide production systems shall use systems amenable to Food and Drug Administration Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines. If using a host bacterial strain for polysaccharide production, Offerors shall aim to develop single -step allelic exchange processes for the production strain development. Offerors developing aptamer ideally will consider D - and L -isomer nucleic acid and amino acid components, with high -throughput microarray screening strategies. Offerors developing novel scavenging technologies will focus on broad -spectr um neutralization. Offerors shall include plans to develop high -affinity antibodies to optimize pr otection. Offerors shall include preliminary data demonstrating the utility of the platform system for production of a prophylaxis against an infectious disease or biological toxin. Offerors shall define how the platform prophylaxis technology reduces risk, offers manufacturing efficiencies and reduces the timeline to produce material acceptable for clinical use. Offerors shall include a plan to evaluate the prophylaxis candidate(s) in a small - animal model. Offerors should aim to induce a rapid onset of immunity, ideally measurable protective responses by 28 and no later than 90 days. Ideally, platform prophylaxis technologies shall induce durable immunity that persists greater than 1 year after the primary series, although thermally stable, single -dose formulations that afford a shorter duration of protection would be acceptable. It is envisioned that protection will be achieved with a single dose (preferred). The primary series shall not be more than 3 doses. 39 It is recommended that Offerors include p lans for interaction with the Food and Drug Administration to seek review of the proposed plans and to receive any additional guidance for model development selection and characterization. Deliverables will include: A technical data package describing the methods, study results, compositions, formulations and other requirements that are specific for the proposed platform technology. A straw -man proposal as to how the platform will be utilized, including logistics, producibility and regulatory metrics, by t he DoD to provide a means for rapid, flexible and agile manufacturing of medical countermeasure s (MCM) to meet emergency and urgent Warfighter needs. Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) Utilization: The DoD has awarded a contract (W911QY -13-C-0010) to establish an ADM capability. In addition to providing a BSL-3 capable, multiproduct manufacturing facility for biologic products, the ADM and a consortium of teaming partners can support development of medical countermeasures from discovery through FDA approval. This includes the facilities, equipment and expertise necessary to perform nonclinical, clinical, process development, and regulatory activities. Please contact the BAA to obtain POC information for the program office managing the ADM contra ct. Nota bene: The decision to, or NOT to, use the ADM is totally independent of, NOT a criterion for, and will have NO bearing on the decision to select a proposal for funding. Topic: CBMV -02 agent of Q fever, an acute febrile disease that can progress to become a serious chronic illness that results in inflammation of the liver, lung, heart and brain. C. burnetii is readily transmitted between hosts and environmental reservoirs, with human infection primarily occurring via the inhalation of infectious aerosols. Currently, a formalin -inactivated vaccine (Q -VAX) is licensed in Australia; however, safety and utilization constraints render it unsuitable for US Warfighters. This vaccine provides near -complete protection in humans, however serious side effects have been observed in individuals either previously exposed to the pathogen or previously vaccinate d. Common side effects include tenderness, erythema and oedema at the injection site, and transient headaches. Uncommon reactions can include immune abscesses at the injection site, subcutaneous lumps that have the potential to disperse without interventio n, hyperhidrosis, lymphadenopathy, granuloma, myalgia and athralgia1, 2. To decrease the incidence of adverse reactions, individuals must undergo a pre -vaccination screening consisting of two assays, a skin and serological test, which measure different arms of the immune system and past medical history. While pre -vaccination screenings have significantly lowered the incidence of vaccine -related hypersensitivity, skin and blood tests are time consuming, costly, and may be incorrectly 40 applied or misinterp reted. Most importantly, patient populations with previous exposure to Coxiella are unable to be vaccinated. Therefore, efforts are underway to develop safer Q fever vaccines that will eliminate the requirement for pre -vaccination screening, yet retain vaccine efficacy and safety. Development and licensure of a Q fever vaccine will proceed under the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Animal Rule. When human clinical trials are not feasible or ethical, the Animal Rule enables licensure of candidate vaccines and therapeutics to proceed when efficacy is demonstrated in well -characterized animal models that reflect human disease. Therefore, suitable models with pre -exposure to C. burnetii which mimic reactogenicity will be required for the development and licensure of candidate vaccines. While the Hartley guinea pig model, which displays common adverse reactions such as the formation of sterile abscesses and granulomas at the inoculation site3, is reliable, it does not recapitulate the uncom mon pathologies associated with vaccination of humans who are already sensitized to Q fever antigens and who may therefore experience serious hypersensitivity reactions if vaccinated. This reactogenicity model will enable identification, development and subsequent licensure of Q fever vaccines that do not cause adverse reactions in humans. Objective: This topic seeks proposals focused on development and standardization of a reactogenicity model for assessing vaccine -related adverse reactions that are similar to those observed in humans. Models should display hypersensitivity to a reference material (e.g. Q - Vax or inactivated C. burnetii ) following pre -exposure to C. burnetii. Potential models may incorpor ate: A tiered evaluation by which a primary model is utilized as an antigen/candidate screen (e.g., delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test) followed by a secondary model to evaluate specific adverse reactions (e.g., pathology model). An ex vivo human mimetic system to evaluate the human immune response (e.g. vaccinated vs un -vaccinated or na\u00efve vs infected donor response). Consideration will be given to proposals that include the following: Models should be directly applicable to the discovery, evalu ation and development of vaccines against Q fever as a result of aerosol exposure to C. burnetii . Characterization of the immune response and pathology (if animal model is developed) following pre-exposure to C. burnetii should be performed. Models should address the adverse reactions shown below : o Common Adverse Reactions: fever, joint swelling, injection site inflammation, induration, and oedema; o Uncommon Adverse Reactions: endocarditis, systemic manifestations such as lymphadenopathy, hyperhidrosis, abscess formation, and granuloma. Models should be planned to have sufficient statistical power to make down - selection decisions on vaccine candidates at a reasonable cost. Models that are less burdensome on the time of investigators and facilities will be preferred over those more burdensome 41 This topic supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program goals by providing a suitable model for safety testing of Q fever vaccine candidates and subsequent licensure under the FDA Animal Rule. Regulatory Compliance: It is anticipated that a new Q Fever vaccine will need to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Animal Rule. The Animal Rule provides a pathway for FDA approval of a new vaccine (21 CFR 19 601.90) in the event that human clinical trials are not feasible or ethical. The Animal Rule enables efficacy to be demonstrated in well-characterized animal models that reflect human disease. Therefore, the model development to be funded under this Topic must be designed from the start for eventual compliance with the Animal Rule. It is recommended that Offerors include plans for interaction with the Food and Drug Administration to seek review of the proposed plans and to receive any additional guidance for model development selection and characterization. FDA recently updated their relevant Draft Guidance, Product Development Under the Animal Rule (see references). FDA -regulated studies subject to the Animal Rule submitted for approval of a specific therapeutic or vaccine must be conducted in accordance with preexisting requirements under the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations (21 CFR part 58). This GLP requirement does not apply to the research done to develop an animal model to comply with the Animal Rule, but in developing such models the steps necessary for GLP compliance must be anticipated and executed. In particular, the model will require validation. These requirements are discussed in the applicable FDA guidances. Additional information on FDA guidances is available on FDA's Web site. In addition, FDA guidances related to medical countermeasures for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents can be accessed through FDA's Medical Countermeasures initiative (MCMi) Web site.

Aug 2000 . 42 Topic: CBMV -03 Development of a Pan -Arenavirus Vaccine that can Elicit Broad Sterilizing Immunity in the Respiratory Mucosa Background: An ideal vaccine for the Department of Defense is one that is safe and ca n effectively provide sterilizing, cross -reactive immunity against aerosolized biological weapons, particularly in the respiratory mucosa. It's well known that mucosal surfaces represent the most important portal of entry for pathogens, as the respiratory tract, in particular, is continuously exposed to environmental antigens and airborne microbes, and thus employs a complex network of mechanisms that enable specific and non -specific responses to prevent infection. However, development of vaccines that ca n induce effective mucosal protection has been hampered by knowledge gaps in the basic immunological mechanisms responsible for the induction of broad, sterilizing mucosal immunity. Arenaviruses, which cause hemorrhagic fever in humans, have potential use as aerosolized bioweapons. Various vaccine platforms have been investigated in animal models, including a ML29 reassortant vaccine against Lassa virus that provided sterilizing immunity to subcutaneous challenge in Guinea pigs1. Additionally, significant progress in delineating the mechanisms of pathogenesis of arenaviruses revealed a critical role for cell -mediated immunity in cross -reactive protection in mucosal infection models of Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)2,3. Despite t his progress, a vaccine that can induce an effective immune response to provide sterile protection across various strains and sub-strains of arenaviruses is lacking. Therefore, this topic seeks proposals that aim to develop a pan -arenavirus vaccine that c an induce sterile immunity in the respiratory mucosa. Of critical interest are proposals that aim to characterize immune mechanisms, mediators, cells or pathways that provide an understanding of broad, sterilizing immunity in the lung and nasal tract. Objective: The topic seeks proposals that will develop a pan -arenavirus [i.e. Junin virus (JUNV), Lassa virus (LASV), and/or (MACV)] vaccine that can induce sterile, cross -strain immunity in the respiratory tract. Additionally, proposals whi ch seek to understand the immunological mechanisms in the respiratory mucosa that are responsible for sterile protection are being solicited. Proposals should also include plans for interaction with the Food and Drug Administration to seek review of the p roposed plans and to receive any further guidance for vaccine design and characterization. Proposals that address the following will be given consideration: Vaccine candidate(s) formulated for at least one dose administered mucosally. Demonstration of im munogenicity and efficacy. Characterization of the immune response after vaccination and challenge. Analyses may include, but are not limited to, innate, humoral and cell -mediated immune responses such as quantitative and functional analyses of IgA and Ig G, lung resident memory T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and respiratory epithelial cells. The proposal should include a plan to determine a correlate or surrogate of mucosal protection. 43 The project should evaluate vaccine candidate(s) in animal models c hallenged via aerosol. Proposals should aim for focused immunodominance, rapid onset of immunity, reduced dose requirements, and immunological memory for durability. Applicants should describe how their vaccine candidates would be manufactured and provid e at least proof -of-concept data to demonstrate manufacturability and the feasibility for scale up. Candidates that demonstrate low logistical burden to improve compatibility with military operations (CONOPS) will be given priority. Factors will includ e ease of administration without specialized medical devices, minimal or no cold -chain requirement, storage stability, minimal number of administrations to generate protective immunity and early onset of protection ( < 30 days preferred, < 90 days maximum). This topic supports the Chemical and Biological Defense Program's goals by providing a pan-arenavirus vaccine and key information regarding the immunological mechanisms required to induce broadly sterilizing mucosal immunity, which will be of great value to current and future vaccine development programs.

Topic: CBMB -01 Advanced Bacterial Antimicrobials and Anti -infectives with Novel Mechanisms of Action Objective: This topic seeks milestone -driven proposals focused on the development of antimicrobial therapies that have the potential to potently and specifically treat multiple drug resistant bacterial infections, including those caused by priority DoD bacterial thr eat agents (B. pseudomallei, F. tularensis, B. anthracis, Y. pestis, and/or C. burnetii ). Proposals shall include drug candidates with supporting data for a unique, novel mechanism of action that does not overlap with marketed antibacterials for which dru g resistant strains have been identified. Broad spectrum activity is desirable but not absolutely essential to this solicitation. Strategies to reverse antibiotic resistance in the disease state and those directed towards host targets have the potential to be effective against one or more diseases are favored. As such, proposals for non -traditional therapeutics are encouraged provided they have demonstrated therapeutic activity when used alone or in combination with existing licensed products. Novel monot herapies targeting topoisomerases/gyrases will not be considered. 44 For the purposes of this topic, a lead candidate will have demonstrated feasibility of manufacturing , in vitro and in vivo evidence of efficacy against biothreat bacterial agents, and suff icient characterization to allow the development of a draft Target Product Profile (TPP). Priority will be given to proposals that fulfill more advanced stages of development either previously, through work conducted in this proposal, or through conjunctio n of other complementary work outside this proposal. Candidates that have initiated Phase I clinical studies for safety, tolerability and PK for clinical indications are of particular interest. Responsive proposals will include preliminary data for candid ate products toward a defined Target Product Profile and a regulatory plan (both required in a phase II proposal, if invited). Respondents to this topic must have documented expertise in drug discovery and development, including demonstrated knowledge of regulatory guidelines and submission procedures for candidate products directed against biological threats. The offeror is expected to comply with Animal Rule Guidance for development of MCMs against biowarfare threats. The following are not of interest and considered outside of the scope of the topic: Basic research, discovery of new targets or candidates, or refinement of lead series to identify a candidate. Efforts focused on therapeutics for non -BWA strains solely or non -resistant strains of F. tula rensis, B. anthracis, Y. pestis , and/or C. burnetii without a concurrent approach against MDR surrogates. Offerors are encouraged to develop R&D collaborations with other organizations in government, academia, and the private sector to broaden and streng then their capabilities. Where possible, Offerors are encouraged to take advantage of specialized resources in DoD and other Government agencies such as facilities/capabilities for biocontainment, collections of biothreat pathogens, Core testing, or advanc ed manufacturing. Because collections of AMR and MDR BSL -3 biodefense pathogens are not currently available to the broad community, predicted efficacy for AMR and/or MDR biodefense pathogens may be demonstrated using clinical isolates of other pathogens with variable or high-level characterized resistance to specific antibiotics (i.e. Methicillin Resistant (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas these non -bioth reat BSL -2 strains should only be used to assess the ability of a therapeutic, or combination of therapeutics, to overcome resistance mechanisms and effectively inhibit microbial growth, etc. Therefore, efforts should not focus on the development of antibi otics that are specific to these surrogate pathogens or their mechanisms of pathogenicity. Additionally, the government currently offers a Core testing capability to perform in vitro and/or in vivo screening of compounds (lead, advanced, or licensed) alone or in combination against an extensive panel of biodefense pathogens, as well as a panel of MDR ESKAPE pathogens, to generate MIC90 and/or murine survival data at no cost and with no intellectual property implications to the providing party. Respondents i nterested in acquiring additional information may inquire through the BAA. It should be noted that during the course of performance of proposals selected for funding, in vitro performance of promising candidates 45 or combinations of candidates will be valida ted, at the cost of the government, by this Core testing capability per government use rights. ADM Utilization: The DoD has awarded a contract (W911QY -13-C-0010) to establish an Advanced Development and Manufacturing capability (ADM). In addition to provi ding a BSL-3 capable, multiproduct manufacturing facility for biologic products, the ADM and a consortium of teaming partners can support development of medical countermeasures from discovery through FDA approval. This includes the facilities, equipment a nd expertise necessary to perform nonclinical, clinical, process development, scale -up, purification, and regulatory submission activities. Respondents interested in discussing potential collaborations with the ADM may inquire through the BAA.

Therefore, post -exposure measures against these pathogens and their sequelae; viral hemorrhagic fevers are a h igh priority. Objective: This topic seeks proposals for the development of a broad novel and innovative technological approaches to treat (post -exposure therapeutic) pan -filovirus infections (Marburg, Sudan and Ebola). This topic supports Chemical and B iological Defense Program goals by developing therapeutic medical countermeasures against members of the Filoviridae family of viruses. Outcomes from these studies are intended to provide options for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) candidates for regulat ory review and potential for interim fielding for limited, defined populations in the event of a declared emergency. This MCM will be used to treat the Warfighter following a biowarfare assault, unintentional or natural exposures to these viruses. Guidance for Offeror Proposals: Broad -spectrum pan -filovirus or pan -ebolavirus therapeutic candidates are highly desirable. Medical devices to reduce viral load including hemofiltration and viral ligand binding devices will be considered. Novel or rep urposed compounds targeted at reducing mortality and/or morbidity may include viral replication inhibitors, blockers of viral uptake, translocation, modulators of the host response, enhancement of viral degradation and clearance interruption of cell pathwa ys resulting in viral infection will be considered. Additionally, other medical countermeasures which increase efficiency and benefit of palliative medicine such as those aimed at preventing or treating systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) of in fected subjects, 46 disseminated coagulopathy, and other compounds that mitigate organ failure/damage during an active infection will be considered. Efforts will be prioritized according to preliminary data in order of decreasing priority: Preliminary Data : o Proposals with an extensive body of preliminary data demonstrating correlates of efficacy in vitro and in vivo with optimized assays and conditions in place to develop and characterized pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK), cy totoxicity, ADME . These will include evidence of viral inhibition and clearance, or demonstrated reduction of mortality and/or morbidity for any combination of pathogens. o Proposals with limited preliminary data demonstrating limited correlative efficacy in vitro and in vivo with incompletely characterized and validated assays and conditions in place to develop and characterize PD and PK, cytotoxicity, ADME and viral inhibition and clearance for any combination of pathogens. o Proposals with only in vitro data demonstrati ng potential therapeutic efficacy. Proposals without in vitro preliminary data, but with similar data and/or validated approaches in other models or systems. Priority will be given to submissions which provide Proof of Concept (POC) and Proof of Principl e (POP) data from validated small and large animal models of filovirus induced disease. Submissions should include scope of work, development paths and regulatory strategy and may encompass both research and development domains of research. Translational science indicating the safety and potential for disease -modifying effects of potential candidates should outline the basis for the submission. Aerosol viral challenge studies are highly desirable. Offerors are encouraged to develop R&D collaborations wit h other organizations in Government, academia, and the private sector to broaden and strengthen their capabilities. Where possible, Offerors are encouraged to take advantage of specialized resources in DoD and other Government agencies such as facilities/c apabilities for biocontainment, collections of biothreat pathogens, Core testing, or advanced manufacturing. Topic: CBMB -03 Antibody -based Therapeutic and/or Prophylactic Protection against Viral Pathogens Background : The changing landscape of biologica l threats necessitates approaches to provide rapid, prophylactic protection and therapeutic support against pathogens of interest. Advances in antibody engineering and rapid and versatile platform technologies render monoclonal antibodies a potential suita ble countermeasure to address this issue, especially given their inherent specificity and long half -lives in the circulation. Objective: This topic is seeking proposals to exploit platform technologies to generate candidate monoclonal antibodies that when administered prophylactically or therapeutically are effective against aerosolized alphaviral induced disease and proceed to develop lead 47 candidates for preclinical and clinical testing. This topic will support CBD Program goals by generating monoclonal a ntibody -based candidates for prophylactic or therapeutic administration that provides protection or therapy against infections by alphaviruses (Venezuelan, Eastern, and/or Western Equine Encephalitis). Proposals can involve approaches that include single monoclonal antibodies or cocktails. Proposals are sought that will minimize logistical considerations pertaining to the Concept of Operations (i.e. minimizing the number of doses, investigation of low - or non -invasive routes of administration, maximizing bioavailability, etc.). Moreover, proposals are encouraged to consider the cost of goods of the final product by taking advantage of economical means of production where feasible. Utilization of novel antibody -based platforms such as single domain antib odies or bispecific antibodies is encouraged. Research in this area may include any or all of the following: 1. Discovery of efficacious monoclonal antibodies In silico approaches to determine likely protective epitopes In vitro and in vivo evaluation of neutralization efficacy to down -select to candidates for further testing 2. In vivo testing of candidate monoclonal antibodies for prophylaxis or therapeutic in relevant animal model(s) Determination of effective dose Determination of the time to onset of protection (or therapeutic window if there is also potential for post -exposure therapeutic use) Determination of the duration of protection post -administration to include biodistribution and bioavailability studies Determination of optimal routes of admin istration and dosing 3. The following are example metrics to which the proposed work could strive Demonstration of greater than 90% protection in the animal model against aerosol exposure Therapeutic efficacy >1 hour post exposure Achievement of protectio n with one, intramuscular dose Achievement of protection within <48 hours Achievement of protection >3 months post -administration Proposals that exploit flexible, single -use bio -manufacturing technologies are desired Topic: CBMB Alphavirus Infections Background: Select alphaviruses can cause severe disease in humans and represent a significant threat to public health. Venezuelan (VEEV), eastern (EEEV), and western equine encephalitis (WEE V) viruses, are causative agents of debilitative, acute, and sometimes fatal encephalitis in North, Central, and South America. These alphaviruses are naturally maintained in a zoonotic cycle between nonhuman vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors. Natural human cases are rare and occur through the bite of an infected mosquito. VEEV, 48 EEEV, and WEEV are of interest to the biodefense community, based on historical weaponization programs, ease of genetic manipulation and high -titer production, stability, and ab ility to infect by aerosol route. Given this threat, there is a critical need for anti - alphavirus therapeutic(s) effective against VEEV, EEEV, WEEV, or all three. Currently, there are no licensed drugs available for the treatment of VEEV, EEEV, and WEEV infections. This represents a significant capability gap in the DoD Joint Chemical and Biological Defense Program's research program. Objective: This topic seeks milestone -driven proposals focused primarily on the discovery or repurposing of novel small mol ecule therapies or adjuvant therapies for the alphaviruses of greatest concern to the DoD Joint Chemical and Biological Defense Program (i.e. VEEV, EEEV, and WEEV). Proposals focused on other approaches will also be considered, but should focus on develop ment of more mature candidates with compelling data provided demonstrated efficacy against VEEV, EEEV, and/or WEEV. The ultimate goal of the program is to deliver at least one lead and one backup chemical series effective against alphaviruses as identified through in vitro and challenge in pre - clinical animal models. Compounds active in vitro will progress through a methodical medicinal chemistry campaign to establish the pharmacophore and to build SAR on appropriate targets, in vitro ADME, and sa fety properties to, in turn, enable the selection of compounds for evaluation of pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and biomarker -driven in vivo efficacy and safety studies. In the most advantageous scenario, the project would identify a superior compound or series with clear intellectual property that could be later optimized for advanced pre -clinical testing. Each proposal may target a known viral target and must utilize an experimental SAR -driven medicinal chemistry effort to identify and optimize chemical series. Responsive proposals will focus on, and will include preliminary data and down - selection criteria for ease of drug manufacture, and establishing proof -of-concept for candidate products towards a defined Target Product Profile (that will be submitte d at the Phase II stage). Phase I Clinical Trials are supported under this topic. Characteristics of successful proposals for this topic may include the following: Milestone driven drug development plan with clear and quantitative go/no go decision points through Phase I Clinical Trials. A clearly outlined starting point for chemical matter that utilizes an experiment - driven, chemistry approach with a solid screening methodology for VEEV, EEEV, or WEEV. For library screening and in silico structure -guided drug design, priority is given to performers with established expertise in this area. Utilization of industry partners, research organizations, or dedicated academic high -throughput screening centers is encouraged. Outlining a logical screening funnel wit h an overview of how experiments and metrics will be used to translate in vitro findings to in vivo effects. Ability to provide treatment in the CNS and/or olfactory nerve. The following are considered outside the scope of the topic: 49 Identification of hos t proteins that play a critical role in the virus lifecycle (host target ID); and, Efforts relying too heavily on SINV and SFV as model systems. Topic: CBMB -05 Pharmacological and Biologic Intervention to reduce inflammation and seizures caused by viral encephalitis. Background: Alphaviruses can cause severe disease in humans and represent a significant threa t to public health. VEEV, EEEV , and WEEV viruses, are causative agents of debilitative, acute, and sometimes fatal encephalitis in North, Central, a nd South America. These alphaviruses are naturally maintained in a zoonotic cycle between nonhuman vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors. Natural human cases are rare and occur through the bite of an infected mosquito. However, VEEV, EEEV, and WEEV are of interest to the biodefense community due to possible aerosol delivery of this family of viruses as warfare agents. Brain inflammatory diseases such viral encephalitis and bacterial meningitis are the subject of extensive translational research to develop t herapies addressing the underlying inflammation and seizures. Objective: This topic seeks proposals for the development of a novel and innovative technology to treat post -exposure alphavirus infection. It is aimed at mitigating the deleterious effects of an active alphaviral infection, namely reducing or eliminating encephalitis, seizures and/or other validated clinical markers of morbidity. This topic supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program goals by developing therapeutic medical countermeasure s against members of the Genus Alphavirus from the Togaviridae Family. This MCM will be used to treat the Warfighter following a biowarfare assault, unintentional or natural exposures to these viruses. Characteristics of successful proposals for this top ic may include the following: Pan-alphavirus c andidates are highly desirable. Novel or repurposed compounds targeted at reducing viral encephalitis, seizures or demonstrated beneficial effects on mortality and/or other clinical markers of morbidity. Efforts will be prioritized according to preliminary data in order of decreasing priority: Proposals with an extensive body of preliminary data demonstrating correlates of efficacy in vitro and in vivo with optimized assays and conditions in place to develop and characterized PD and PK , cytotoxicity, ADME . Demonstrated reduction of mortality and/or morbidity for any combination of pathogens, with normalization of neuronal electric activity with or without reduction in number and intensity of seizures as well as reduction or elimination of encephalitis after viral challenge. Viral inhibition and clearance is desirable but not required. Proposals with limited preliminary data demonstrating limited correlative efficacy in vitro and in vivo with incompletely chara cterized and validated assays and conditions in place to develop and characterize PD and PK, cytotoxicity, ADME, and neuronal activity for any combination of pathogens. 50 Proposals with only in vitro data demonstrating potential therapeutic efficacy. Proposa ls without in vitro preliminary data, but with similar data and/or validated approaches in other models or systems. Topic: CBMB -06 Development and Integration of Novel MCM Delivery and Bioagent -MCM Co - Localization Platforms Background: Traditional appro aches in biodefense MCM programs face significant and sometimes greater obstacles on the path to success than non -defense driven pharmaceutical industry due to the fact that biowarfare agents (BWAs) including bacteria, viruses and biotoxins are difficult t o eradicate and BWA -caused infections/intoxications are harder to cure and often quickly lethal. In addition to the constrained resources dedicated to biodefense MCMs, limited market share and low commercial interest impede the development of MCMs against BWAs. Development/employment of revolutionary technologies, such as an integrated BWA -collection -and-MCM -delivery platform to track, collect, and eradicate BWAs, is needed to help biodefense programs bridge the 'valley of death' and overcome these challeng es. Objective : This topic seeks proposals to capture, integrate and/or develop emerging technologies that can provide novel approaches to physically and pharmacologically mitigate infection/intoxication of threat agents. If successful, the technologies should sequester threat agents at their sites of entry or during their initial circulation so that further dissemination to replication or infection site(s) can be avoided in addition to carrying the MCM payload to wherever and whenever the BWAs are presen t including infection sites for BWA eradication. A desirable improvement of such technologies will be to carry MCMs with triggerable, on - demand drug release to kill the pathogens while they are entrapped or sequestered. Together, successful technologies a re expected to provide novel capacities in combating BWAs. Proposals should address material needs and methods for recognizing and collecting agents, co-localizing agents with MCMs, and utilizing agent -specific and/or the body's response to infection as t argeting guide and drug release trigger. Precisely directed or triggered MCM release within the MCM -BWA complex or within infected cells will be ideal although MCM release in target tissue(s) is also acceptable. Since this is a platform instead of a drug development program, the use of a marker (or prototype) antibiotic, antiviral and/or antitoxin of small molecules or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for POC purpose of a technology is acceptable. The following desired components, alone or in combination, sh ould be addressed for one class of BWAs as the program threshold. Yet, a technology should be able to demonstrate acquired ability or rationalized potential to take on multiple BWAs (broad spectrum platform) as the program goal. Technologies to recognize and collect BWAs by specific ligand binding polymers, receptor and antibody approaches, or other bioengineering/nanotechnology means to 51 allow early stage in vivo collection and an eventual eradication of pathogens are encouraged. Integration of pathogen sequestration into MCM delivery systems which seek to provide restriction of pathogen replication and dissemination, co -localization of pathogen with drug, within -trap triggered release and kill, and tissue -specific targeting of MCMs are desired. Examples may include the pulmonary, lymph nodes/spleen, and central nervous system (CNS) sites of infection or intoxication. Methods that encompass site -specific cellular receptor -ligand interactions are sought. The delivery of molecules (e.g., small molecules, a ntisense, and/or mAbs) to specific pathogens or inside host cells and subcellular compartments is desirable. Methods of sustained and biologically responsive delivery of potential therapeutics/marker MCMs to sites of emerging pathology. On -demand delivery and release kinetics of therapeutic candidates is desired. Preferential or localized delivery with controlled release of MCM payloads is sought to minimize drug (dose) related toxicities and enhance/enable efficacy. Novel delivery systems such as enginee red viral particles including bacteriophages, red blood cell ghosts, engineered cells, and various nano -particles (polymeric, protocells, liposomes, multi -lamellar constructs, etc.) which can release their diversified payloads in response to pathogen speci ficity or disease biomarkers including host cytokine/immune responses are sought. Other novel technologies that can satisfy the objectives of this topic will also be considered. The use of engineered cells, mammalian cell -nanoparticle complexes, artificia l membrane constructs, engineered bacteriophages, viral like particles (VLPs) BWA -trapping systems and any other biocompatible nano -carriers are those among the many technologies that will be considered. Those technologies that trap, restrict or confine BW As, restrict their movement at sites of entry or during initial general circulation, and thus block dissemination/replication/infection as well as infection site eradication of threat agents are sought. The ability to target infected cells or subcellular compartments at sites of infection is strongly encouraged. The ultimate goal is to co -localize the pathogenic agent and MCMs, and to initiate biologically responsive release of the therapeutic payloads during various stages from BWA exposure, infection to disease progression. It is expected that the offerors will consider technologies to entrap pathogens and to cause local release of MCMs to kill them wherever and whenever the pathogens go. Technologies that explore responsive delivery of MCMs, therapeut ics, host immune modulators are of interest. The deployment of site -directed targeted delivery of MCMs to either pathogen, cells of interest, effector cells or tissues/organs are of great interest. As pathologies of the CNS are of concern, methods are of interest to overcome or transiently modify bl ood brain barrier (BBB) function to enable effective CNS MCM delivery. These may include the ability to use chaperone delivery systems that allow access to the CNS. Technologies that demonstrate site localization and pathology - or biomarker -dependent release of payloads are highly encouraged. Technologies with supporting preliminary data will receive a higher priority. To demonstrate the platform and enabling nature of such 52 technologies, offerors must consider one (initially) or more (eventually) clas ses of BWAs of interest to DTRA, Botulinum Neurotoxin (BoNT). Acceptable maturity of technology can range from early in vitro POC t o late preclinical/clinical application demonstration in other medical fields but has to rationalize the possibility and relevance in biodefense application. Collaboration among technology developers and MCM developers are encouraged during proposal phase or after funding award to advance suitable technologies and MCMs rapidly toward military applications in Biodefense. Offerors are encouraged to take advantage of specialized resources in DoD and other Government agencies such as facilities/capabilities fo r biocontainment, collections of biothreat pathogens, Core testing, or advanced manufacturing.

Further information may be required if the proposal is successful. All work under any award made under this BAA involving human su bjects must be conducted in accordance with 32 CFR 219, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 980, and DoD Instruction 3216.02, and, as applicable, 21 CFR parts 11, 50, 56, GCP, the ICH as well as other applicable federal and state regulations. Contractors must be cognizant of and abide by the additional restrictions and limitations imposed on the DoD regarding research involving human subjects, specifically as regards to vulnerable populations (32 CFR 219 modifications to subparts B -D of 45 CFR 46), recruitment of military researc h subjects (32 CFR 219), and surrogate consent (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 980). DTRA Directive 3216.01 establishes the DTRA Human Subjects Protection Program, sets forth the policies, defines the applicable terms, and delineates the procedures necessary to ensure DTRA compliance with federal and DoD regulations and legislation governing human subject research. The regulations mandate that all DoD activities, components, and agencies protect the rights and welfare of human subjects of study in DoD supported research, de velopment, test and evaluation, and related activities hereafter referred to as \"research.\" The requirement to comply with the regulations applies to new starts and to continuing research. The DTRA Directive requires that research using human subjects ma y not begin or continue until the DTRA Research Oversight Board (ROB) has reviewed and approved the proposed protocol. Contractors and subcontractors are required to submit a valid federal assurance for their organization (institution, laboratory, facilit y) that has been issued by either DoD or the Department of Health and Human Services, and documentation of review of proposed protocols by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) to include consent forms for any planned research using human subjects to the ROB for its review through the contracting officer's representative (if assigned) or the 55 contracting officer. The ROB review is separate from, and in addition to, local IRB review. A study is considered to involve human research subjects if: 1) ther e is interaction with the subject (even simply talking to the subject qualifies; no needles are required); and 2) if the study involves collection and/or analysis of personal/private information about an individual, or if material used in the study contain s links to such information. Written approval to begin research or to subcontract for the use of human subjects under the proposed protocol will be provided in writing from the DTRA ROB, through the contracting officer. Both the contractor and the Govern ment must maintain a copy of this approval. Any proposed modifications or amendments to the approved protocol or consent forms must be submitted to the local IRB and the DTRA ROB for review and approval. Examples of modifications/amendments to the protoc ol include but are not limited to: a change of the Principal Investigator; changes in duration or intensity of exposure to some stimulus or agent; changes in the information requested of volunteers, or changes to the use of specimens or data collected; or changes in perceived or measured risks or benefits to volunteers that require changes to the study. Research pursuant to such modifications or amendments must not be initiated without IRB and ROB approval except when necessary to eliminate apparent and i mmediate hazards to the subject(s). Research projects lasting more than one year require IRB review at least annually, or more frequently as required by the responsible IRB. ROB review and approval is required annually. The contractor or subcontractor m ust provide documentation of continued IRB review of protocols for ROB review and approval. Research must not continue without renewed ROB approval unless necessary to eliminate apparent and immediate hazards to the subject(s). Clauses regarding human su bjects research will be included in all contracts involving human subjects research. Non -compliance with any provision of this clause may result in withholding of payments under the contract pursuant to the terms and conditions. The Government shall not be responsible for any costs incurred for research involving human subjects prior to protocol approval by the ROB. 8.1.7 Animal Use If the proposed research involves the use of live nonhuman vertebrate animals, Offerors are required to describe the proposed ani mal use and type of animals being used.

Date _________________________________ Printed Name and Title _________________________________ _________________________________ Signature _________________________________ Offerors responding to this BAA requesting an OTA shall specifically identify any asserted restrictions on the Government's use of intellectual property contemplated under those award instruments. For this purpose, Offerors must propose specific Intellectual Property terms and conditions and a data deliverable list. Offerors are encouraged to model their data rights assertions li st to the template provided in DFARS 252.227 -7017. 8.1.12 Subcontracting Plan Any Offeror, other than small businesses, submitting a proposal for an award with a value more than the amount listed in FAR 19.702(a)(1) and that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.7. Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637(d)), it is the policy of the 60 Government to enable small business and small disadvantaged business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering servic es as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy. A subcontracting plan identifies the Offeror's approach to awarding subcontracts to small business, small disadvantaged business, women -owned small business, service -disabled veteran owned small business, and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUB Zone) small business concerns, on this effort. A DCMA approved master plan may be submitted in lieu of an individual contract plan. The narrative in the subcontract plan must address each element listed in FAR 19.704(a)(1) -(11). The emphasis of the plan must be to maximize small business participation to the maximum extent practicable. The current DoD subc ontracting goals are as follows: Percentage of subcontracted dollars Small Business 34.5% HUB Zone Small Business 3% Small Disadvantaged Business 5% Women -Owned Small Business Concerns 5% Service -Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 3% Note: Provide rationale if the Small Disadvantaged Business goal cannot be achieved per DFARS 219.705 -4(d), or if subcontracting possibilities do not exist (reference FAR 19.705 -2(c)). 8.1.13 Identification of Team Members Offerors shall include a list of team members (e.g. subcontractors/consultants) that are being proposed. Offerors shall also include the estimated percentage of the effort to be performed by the Offeror and percentage of work to be performed by proposed team members. 8.1.14 Statement of Curren t and Pending Support Offerors must include a statement of current and pending support of all related work that is currently receiving or may potentially receive financial support. This information must be included for each investigator listed in the pro posal. 8.1.15 Modified Pre -award Checklist - SF 1408 Any offeror awarded a cost type contract must be in compliance with FAR 16.301 -3 \"Limitations\" restrictions. Specifically, the Offeror's accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract; and will be subject to DCAA audit and surveillance during performance to provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost controls are being used. Any Offeror that has not been subject to a DCAA pre or post -award acc ounting system audit is required to submit a Modified Preaward Checklist (SF 1408), which will expedite the pre -award survey of the accounting system by DCAA. Refer to www.dcaa.mil for further assistance preparing an 61 adequate cost proposal. Offeror's that have been subject to an DCAA accounting system audit shall provide the resultant audit report in lieu of the SF1408. 8.1.16 Forward Pricing Rate Agreement/Provisional Billing Rates Offerors shall include a copy of any current Forward Pricing Rate Agreements or Provisional Billing Rate Agreements with Government agencies, such as Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), the Office of Naval Research (ONR) or the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).
