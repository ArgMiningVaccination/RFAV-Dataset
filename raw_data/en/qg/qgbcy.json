The delicate, rolling build and release cycles of the well-played gongs will lead you on a journey of deep relaxation, leaving you feeling tuned and refreshed and ready to tackle the challenges of these stressful times. The Gong can strengthen your immune system! For many of you who have experienced Gong Meditation, there undoubtedly are benefits on many levels - physical, emotional and spiritual. There is much anecdotal evidence suggesting that Gong Meditation can also boost the immune system. But is there medical research to back this up? Yes, and the connection is in stress reduction! Mitchell L. Gaynor, M.D., is the Director of Medical Oncology and Integrative Medicine at the Strang-Cornell Cancer Prevention Center in New York and has authored numerous books on the subject of using sound to reduce stress to keep us healthy. Dr. Gaynor, in his seminal book, The Healing Power of Sound, said, \"reducing stress is significant because stress can depress every aspect of the immune system, including those that protect us against flu and against cancer.\" During a Gong Meditation, it is common for our heart rate to drop and our breathing to become slow and deep, decreasing the production of stress hormones. Indeed, Dr. Gaynor states that the benefits of music can lower blood pressure and respiratory rates, reduce cardiac complications, increase the immune response, and boost our natural opiates. Dr. Daniel Levitin, who studies the neuroscience of music at McGill University in Montreal and is the author of the book \"This is Your Brain on Music\" (Plume/Penguin, 2007), points to research of more than 400 studies that found that music improves the body's immune system function and reduces stress (Trends in Cognitive Sciences April 2013). The researchers found that listening to and playing music increases the body's production of the antibody immunoglobulin A and \"natural killer cells\" \u2014 the cells that attack invading viruses and boost the immune system's effectiveness. Music also reduces levels of the stress hormone cortisol. \"This is one reason why music is associated with relaxation,\" Dr. Levitin says. __ File Download Any audio files purchased on our site need to be downloaded first to a computer, and then synced to your iPad, iPhone or mobile device.
