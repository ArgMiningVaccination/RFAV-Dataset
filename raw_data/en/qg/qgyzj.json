They have the potent power to transform your life and enhance your health. There are many methods of applying essential oils. Essential oils are small in molecular size, can quickly penetrate the skin and are easily absorbed through the bottom of the feet. Some essential oils containing sesquiterpenes have the ability to pass the blood brain barrier which allows more oxygen into the brain. Because the oils can access these areas through aromatherapy (smell) they can be very effective for releasing emotional trauma stored in the brain. They can also be inhaled via a diffuser which puts a fine mist of the whole oil into the air. This is a beautiful way to medicinally transform your surroundings, uplift mood, and promote calmness. Essential oils are used individually as well as part of acupuncture and chiropractic treatments to help address a wide variety of issues such as pain relief, stress reduction, digestion improvement and more. Dr Ross may suggest a particular oil or blend to improve your overall health and well being.
