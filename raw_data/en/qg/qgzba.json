Gary Ave. Suite 101 Bloomingdale, IL 60108 1 5 1 I had an appointment at 11 o'clock on the 4th. I arrived, and the establishment was closed. No one even warned or postponed. This is bad customer service. I have wasted a lot of my time, even though you could have spent just a minute warning me. - David Casperson The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S. Gary Ave. Suite 101 Bloomingdale, IL 60108 1 5 1 Dr. Harry Patel does the least amount of work to correct any problems you may have. I am not interested in going back to this location until he is gone. I can crack and stretch my joints better than he even tries. Again, he is very lazy and does the least amount of effort to help you. - Raul Flores The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S. Gary Ave. Suite 101 Bloomingdale, IL 60108 4 5 1 1st time trying treatment at the Joint or any Chiro for that matter. Outstanding service from first service appointment to coordinated plan. For approximately 6 months Dr. Harry and Dr. Victoria have provided expert help and effortless adjustments. They have assisted me to regain movement in areas where I struggled. Looking forward to continue care. - Joe Schalberg The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S. Gary Ave. Suite 101 Bloomingdale, IL 60108 5 5 1 Dr Harry, Victoria and Ezequiiel all do a great job at keeping me pain free to exercise and do the things I do. Before treatment I needed to stop during my walks to stretch and relax my joints. Now I walk 3-4 miles without needing to do that. You can't beat the convenience. Stop in when you can and walk out feeling good - Heather O. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S. Gary Ave. Suite 101 Bloomingdale, IL 60108 5 5 1 Fantastic place!

I have gone to chiropractors in the past but always end up straying away because the cost was outrageous, even with the help. - Evalis B. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S. Gary Ave. Suite 101 Bloomingdale, IL 60108 5 5 1 I have been going to this location for over a year. I highly recommend coming here if you want to change your life.

Highly recommend at least giving it a shot. I love everyone in this office. - Angie J. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S. Gary Ave. Suite 101 Bloomingdale, IL 60108 5 5 1 My experiences here at The Joint with Dr. Jose, Dr. Alexis and the younger chiropractors have been nothing short of excellent. They truly care, are very knowledgeable, understand and educate their patients on preventative care, and what further to do during their course of treatments. I love how caring these chiropractors are. They truly make my treatments and healing process worth it every week. I send many family, friends, clients and others to experience their treatment, compassion, dedication and care wherever a Joint is located. I love promoting them as a medical fitness professional, mother and as a trainer for army recruits. - Tim S. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S.

The staff at the Joint in Bloomingdale are helpful and always willing to answer questions you have. I started going to chiropractors due to horrible tension migraines. I have been to two different chiropractors and could never finish treatment because it was too expensive. I can now say thanks to The Joint I am on the road to recovery. I haven't had a migraine since starting treatment. - Sydney L. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S. Gary Ave. Suite 101 Bloomingdale, IL 60108 5 5 1 Great place! - Clifford H.

The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S. Gary Ave. Suite 101 Bloomingdale, IL 60108 5 5 1 From the moment I walked into the Joint Chiropractic I was greeted so nicely. My best friend has been coming to this location for a while now, and suggestsed I go for my knee problems. I was skeptical at first because I did not know what a chiropractor could do, and if it would even help with my pain. Well I am glad I was proven wrong! Just in the two weeks I have gone I have seen minor changes (change is not instant it takes time). For example, I use to not be able to walk for even 5 minutes before my knees hurt really bad. But just the other day I was able to walk for 5 hours with little issue. Every doctor in the office has their special technique but they are all amazing. I definetely recommend that you come in and stick with it!! - Shanel N. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S. Gary Ave. Suite 101 Bloomingdale, IL 60108 5 5 1 I have had lower back pain for the last few years. They have helped me so much with understanding how to better heal and maintain a pain free back, not only with their chiropractic work but with stretches and exercises. I have continued to go throughout my second pregnancy and my hip and joint pain is already so much better than with my first. I really appreciate that they take the time to understand my personal needs and adjust accordingly. - Zainab B. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S.

Prior to being treated regularly I needed to stop when waking distances to stretch pain away. I also needed to sit down time to time while performing simple tasks like vacuuming. Now I can keep moving and pain free for the most part. Glad I made the decision to come here. - Jackie A. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S.

The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S. Gary Ave. Suite 101 Bloomingdale, IL 60108 5 5 1 Originally I stopped at The Joint Chiropractic Bloomingdale during their open house to see what they were all about. The following morning Dr. Tom called as a follow up, which was a very nice, personal touch. So, when my chiropractor was out of town, and due to low back pain from bulging discs, I went into The Joint Bloomingdale and saw Dr. Tom. He is AMAZING! After my first adjustment, I slept like a baby, mowed the lawn the next day with out feeling debilitated and could actually get up from the couch with out having to hold on to anything to straighten up and with out my normal low back spasm. He also did some decompression on my shoulder which made a huge difference. Thank You, Dr. Tom!! - Ana P. The Joint Chiropractic $$ (630) 250-5837 148 S.
