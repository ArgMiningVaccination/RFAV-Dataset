Initial Consultation: Have an Ayurvedic Consultation today and find the cause of your health problems. During first or initial consultation, Dr. Jay will take a detailed history of your life style, current and past illnesses, eating patterns, daily routine, exercise routine, etc. After the Ayurvedic evaluation including pulse, tongue, nails and other diagnostics, she will determine your Body Constitution, determine the cause for your health problems and will create a unique health care plan for you including ayurvedic treatments, natural herbal formulations, diet and lifestyle modifications, tips about Pranayama, meditation, and Panchakarma therapies. Initial consultation normally takes about an hour and costs $195.00. Follow-up Consultations: During follow-up visits, which are 4-6 weeks apart (or sooner depending on your health condition) Dr. Apte will reassess your condition and make necessary changes in the treatment plan or herbal formulations. Generally 2-3 follow-ups are required (remember Ayurveda is trying to remove the cause, not treat the symptoms). Removing the cause may take time, depending on how chronic the problem is. Follow-up visits are only $85 and take about half an hour. Herbs: Dr. Jay many times creates special herbal formulations for her patients. These herbal formulations cost $32 each and are good for 25-30 days depending on dosage. Herbs take about 1/2 hour to make. So plan for 2 hours for initial consultation and herbs. Ayurvedic Panchakarma is an excellent detoxification and purification program to treat numerous chronic ailments and also to rejuvenate and renew yourself. The chemical and toxic build-up in the body (due to pollutants) block energy channels and disrupt the functioning of the systems in the body causing many illnesses. The detox and purifying actions of Panchakarma first dislodge the toxins from the tissues, and then flush them out of body thereby restoring clean, properly tuned systems and body's natural balance. The results can be miraculous. People with chronic illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, Chronic Pain, Chronic Fatigue, Arthritis, Allergies, Digestive problems and many others, benefit from Panchakarma tremendously. Even if you are blessed with good health, Dr. Jay recommends a yearly Panchakarma to tune-up your body and maintain your good health. After Panchakarma you will experience increased energy, improved metabolism, sound sleep, a calm mind, improved clarity and focus and increased productivity and efficiency. It will give life to your living. Our normal cost for a 5-day (1-week) Panchakarma treatment is $2,200.
