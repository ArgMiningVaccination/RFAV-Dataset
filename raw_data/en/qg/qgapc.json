History Founded in 1992, SCNM prepares students to become naturopathic physicians, educated and trained in the principles and practices of health promotion, disease management and prevention. The next generation of healthcare providers will consider all available means to heal patients, with an emphasis on naturopathic therapies that prevent disease before it happens and heals without harming. Located in Tempe, Arizona, the college's mission is to educate tomorrow's medical innovators in the art and science of integrative wellness through its accredited four-year program in naturopathic medicine. The college also serves the public by providing quality education, research and natural medical care. SCNM is only one of five accredited schools of naturopathic medicine in the United States and the first medical school in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The college offers a four-year, professional-level doctor of naturopathic medicine (ND) program and non-degree coursework. The college has become a respected source of information in the field of natural health care with the help of high-quality administration, faculty and staff working with the media and community to create a higher level of awareness among the public. SCNM is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. SCNM's ND program is accredited by the Council of Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). Both accreditors are recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.Significance of the White Coat Ceremony The donning of the white coat signifies a milestone, a transition from deconstruction to reconstruction. These students have spent two years learning about the human body, mind and condition as pieces and parts of a whole. At this stage they enter the process of putting the puzzle together, of understanding how each piece fits with another, so that they begin to see and treat their patients as a whole entity. Although each coat is merely a piece of white material, it signifies responsibility and knowledge. All students of medicine have the responsibility to apply what they know, to continue learning, and to continue growing to become the best naturopathic doctors possible. May we wear our coats with humility and pride and keep foremost in our minds that our patient's health is a journey in which we participate as teachers and students. May we wear our coats and remember the basic principles of Naturopathic Medicine. Mission Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and Health Sciences is a school of medicine and health sciences grounded in naturopathic principles. Dedicated to the ideal that everyone deserves high-quality healthcare, we engage students in a rigorous, innovative academic programs, discover and expand knowledge, and empower individuals and communities to achieve optimal health. White Coat Oath I, (Name), as a student of Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, will enter the clinical portion of my educational training with an open mind and eager spirit. I will incorporate the information that I have learned in the classroom with the knowledge that is now being passed on to me by my clinical supervisors. As a student clinician, I will parallel my therapeutic approach to the basic principles of Naturopathic Medicine: First Do No Harm, The Healing Power of Nature, Identify and Treat the Cause, Treat the Whole Person, Physician as Teacher, Prevention is the Best Cure. I will treat each patient individually; I will look for the cause and treat the whole person. Each time I wear my white coat, I will do so with honor for those that trust me, with an open mind for those that are educating me, and with respect and responsibility for those that have paved the way before me in this profession.
