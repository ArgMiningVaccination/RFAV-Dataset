People with asthma experience symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. These symptoms are commonly caused as a result of the bronchial tubes tightening, inflammation of the mucous membranes or the muscular walls of the diaphragm contracting (Battaglia, 2007). Some asthmatic attacks can be mild whilst others are more severe and require immediate medical assistance. Some individuals experience asthmatic attacks daily, others can go for a long period of time with no symptoms. Furthermore, there are many factors which trigger asthma attacks, such as changes in weather, stress, viral infections, exercise, air pollution and inhaled allergens, such as dust, mould spores, mites, animal hair or feathers and cigarette smoke. Certain chemical food additives can also trigger asthma in some people. It is very important for asthma sufferers to heed medical advice and take prescribed medication. Nonetheless, some essential oils have useful anti-inflammatory, anti-spasmodic, expectorant, nervine and sedative properties. These essential oils may, therefore, be used as a preventative measure for asthma. The methods of use and the choice of oils, will depend, however, upon the factors which trigger an asthmatic attack for example; if an infection is present, if stress and anxiety are contributory factors or if the attack is an allergic response. I have detailed some of the oils that I find most useful below, along with suggested methods of use. These methods are recommended as preventative measures only, that can be taken in between attacks. During attacks I strongly recommend that only the prescribed medication is taken. Using essential oils for asthma Inhalation To help stop the bronchial tubes tightening, diffuse 2 drops of Sweet Thyme ct linalol), 4 drop of Benzoin (Styrax benzoin). The same essential oils may also be placed on tissue or handkerchief, or into an aromatherapy inhalator and inhaled. Alternatively, the oils can be blended with 14ml of Moisturising Cream and applied to the chest. There are conflicting opinions on whether people with asthma should use steam inhalation, with some experts claiming that the heat may increase inflammation of the mucous membranes and worsen the condition. If steam inhalation is used, it should be done so with medical consent and very carefully by gradually increasing the time from 30 seconds on the first occasion to no more than three minutes on subsequent occasions if no adverse reaction is experienced. To do a steam inhalation pour steaming hot water into a large bowl and add 3 drops of [Frankincense](https://www.baseformula.com/frankincense-essential-oil) (Boswellia carterii) essential oil. Lean over the bowl and breathe. Frankincense is traditionally noted for its expectorant, and relaxant properties, and several clinical studies confirm its anti-inflammatory properties (Noroozi, et al., 2018). Frankincense may also help an individual slow down and deepen their breathing. For individuals who have disturbed sleep due to night coughing, put 4 drops of [Lavender](https://www.baseformula.com/lavender-french-essential-oil) (Lavandula angustifolia) on the pillow (or tissue) at night. This essential oil is renowned for its sedative properties and for promoting restful and peaceful sleep. Additionally, researchers evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of Lavender on experimentally induced bronchial asthma in a murine model, with findings indicating that the essential oil possesses anti-inflammatory properties which may be helpful for bronchial asthmatic sufferers (Ueno-Iio, et al., 2014). Massage Studies have shown that massage therapy can help improve lung function in some asthma sufferers (Ji Wu, et al., 2017) and alleviate anxiety (Goli & Shabestari 2017). It may therefore be helpful to have regular aromatherapy massages with a professional therapist who can choose the most appropriate oils and work on the thoracic area to help open the chest and shoulders. For preventative treatment of those prone to asthma I recommend regular massage with 25ml Sweet Almond Oil, 5ml Neem Oil, 1 drop Eucalyptus, 4 Frankincense, 4 [Pine](https://www.baseformula.com/pine-needle-essential-oil) and 1 Ginger. Aroma-reflex facial Using a daily aroma-reflex facial routine, such as the one shown below may help reduce stress and may, therefore, be helpful for asthmatic sufferers, whose trigger is emotional distress. - Cleanse face using 50ml of Cleansing lotion with 2 drops of [Sweet Thyme](https://www.baseformula.com/thyme-sweet-linalol-essential-oil), 4 drops of Lavender and 1 drop of Frankincense - Tone face with our 100% pure Rose Otto Hydrolat - Apply a few drops of facial oil.

These oils can be used alongside conventional treatment although not during an asthmatic attack! I recommend choosing up to three different oils and mixing them into 10ml of carrier oil, [bath oil ](https://www.baseformula.com/bath-oil)or SLS Free Shower Gel in the ratio of 2 drops from the top note category, 4 drops from the middle note category and 1 drop from the base note category. This blend can then be added to the bath to aid relaxation. Pour the mixture into warm (not hot) running bath water and relax for approximately 20 minutes. |Top note advice for asthma Other complementary health programmes such practising daily mindfulness or meditation might help reduce factors, such as stress, that can trigger asthmatic attacks. Yoga and other forms of gentle exercise which improve posture and help open the lungs are usually beneficial too. Furthermore, healthy eating can also reduce the number and severity of attacks with some experts suggesting that all vegetables and salad foods (with the exception of tomatoes), as well as sprouting seeds, onions, garlic, rye bread, whole grains, pulses, all fish, most meat (with the exception of pork, bacon and ham), and all fruit can be helpful in managing the condition.
