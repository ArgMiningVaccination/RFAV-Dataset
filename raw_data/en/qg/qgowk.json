Making matters worse, health officials have now ramped up those recommendations, telling EVERY person over the age of 6 months get a flu shot, healthy or not, low risk or high. Everyone! Three hundred million of you, every year from the year you are born until the year you die. But hold on a minute. There's something fishy about this. Because human antibodies normally last a lifetime, remember? That's why you don't get the chicken pox over and over again; because the first time you got the chicken pox as a kid, your body created chicken pox antibodies and those antibodies last a lifetime. Your immune system provides you with lifetime immunity from chicken pox. CDC officials believe that a year after someone gets the flu shot, antibody levels \u2014 an indicator of immunity \u2014 can fall by two-thirds or more. Some key studies indicate the resulting levels are not strong enough to be protective, said Nancy Cox, head of the CDC's chief of the CDC's flu division.\u00b9 Vaccines must not help the body produce antibodies then, because if that was true, whoever had the influenza vaccine would have lifetime immunity to those specific strains. However, many times a person will get the actual condition after being vaccinated. This is one way we can see that they are ineffective overall and actually hurt the immune system. According to the NVIC (National Vaccine Information Center), vaccines are immune suppressive, which means they suppress your immune system, which may not return to normal for weeks to months. They are also shown to have an effect on brain function, DNA/RNA, t-cell function, and the cardiovascular system being linked to chronic conditions such as autoimmune disorders, allergies, and cancer.\u00b2 One 2007 study published in the Annals of Medicine concluded that: \"Abnormalities in arterial function and LDL oxidation may persist for at least 2 weeks after a slight inflammatory reaction induced by influenza vaccination. These could explain in part the earlier reported increase in cardiovascular risk during the first weeks after an acute inflammatory disorder.\"\u00b3 These vaccines are causing worse conditions that the flu typically ever is and are proving to be potentially deadly. Not that it is any fun, but the best way to protect yourself against the flu is to actually be exposed naturally to the flu virus, allowing your body to produce lifetime antibodies. By taking Vitamin D, burst training, eating according to the Maximized Living nutrition plans, avoiding toxins (which are heavily present in flu vaccines), and making sure your nervous system is functioning at it's highest level, you are taking the proper steps to eliminate the chance of getting the flu and fighting it off the correct way - without exposing you or your family to dangerous toxins. The flu shots are toxic to your body! What else are you exposing yourself to at home that can increase this toxicity? Do you know the hidden sources of toxicity in your house? The internal environment of your house is 5-10x more toxic than the outdoor environment!

But it seems to me that more interestingly [staxyn vs levitra](http://levitra-vs-viagra.com/levitra-vs-viagra.html) here about what you don't know and it would be necessary.
