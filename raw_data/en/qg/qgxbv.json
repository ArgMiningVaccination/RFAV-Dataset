We aimed to describe US surveillance data collected through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a passive system, and v-safe, a new active system, during the first 6 months of the US COVID-19 vaccination programme. Methods In this observational study, we analysed data reported to VAERS and v-safe during Dec 14, 2020, to June 14, 20 21. VAERS reports were categorised as non-serious, serious, or death. Reporting rates were calculated using numbers of CO VID-19 doses administered as the denominator . We analysed v-safe survey reports from d ays 0-7 after vaccination for reactogenicity, severity (mild, moderate, or severe), and health impacts (i e, unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, or received care from a medical professional).Findings During the study period, 298 792 852 doses of mRNA vaccines were administered in the USA. VAERS process ed 340 522 reports: 3 13 499 (92 \u00b71%) were non-serious, 22 527 (6\u00b76%) were serious (non-death), and 4496 (1\u00b73%) were deaths. Over half of 7 914 583 v-s afe participants self-reported local and systemic reactogenicity, more frequently after do se tw o (4 068 447 [71 \u00b77%] of 5 674 420 participant s for local reactogenicity and 4 018 920 [70\u00b78%] f or systemic) than after dose one (4 644 989 [68\u00b76 %] of 6 775 515 particip ants for local reactogenicity and 3 573 429 [52\u00b7 for systemic). Injection-site pain (4 488 402 [66 \u00b72%] of 6 775 515 participa nts after dose one and 3 890 848 [68 \u00b76%] of 5 674 420 participants after dose two), fatigue ( 2 295 205 [33 \u00b79%] participants after dose one and 3 158 299 part icipants [55\u00b77%] after dose tw o), and headache (1 831 471 [27\u00b70%] participants after dose one and 2 623 721 [46\u00b72%] participants after dose two) were commonly reported during days 0-7 following vaccination. Reactogenicity was reported most frequently the day after vaccination; most reactions were mild. More reports of being unable to work, do normal activities, or of seeking medical care occurred after dos e two (1 821 421 [32 \u00b71%]) than after dose one (808 963 [1 1\u00b79%]); less than 1% of participants reported seeking medical care after vaccination (56 647 [0\u00b7 8%] after dose one and 5 3 077 [0\u00b79% ] after dose two). Interpretation: Safety data from more than 298 millio n doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administered in the first 6 months of the US vaccination programme show that most reported adverse events were mild and short in duration.Funding US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Reactogenicity was more frequently reported after dose two than after dose one and among participants younger than 65 years than among older participants. 3-5Post-authorisation safety monitoring can characterise the safety profiles of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in large and heterogeneous populations. 6 Phased administration of COVID-19 vaccines in the USA began with health-care workers and long-term care-facility residents and was expanded to the general population during spring 2021; however, implementation plans varied by state. 7 The major sources of initial US safety data were the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous, passive reporting system; 8 and v-safe,9 a new active monitoring system. VAERS was established in 1990 as the US early warning system to rapidly detect adverse events that might occur following vaccinations. V-safe was established in 2020 specifically for monitoring COVID-19 vaccine Articles2 www.thelancet.com/infection Published online March 7, 2022 https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00054-8safety in the USA and collects information on reactogenicity and effects on health following COVID-19 vaccination. Previous reports from these systems have been issued.10-14 We aimed to review VAERS and v-safe data during the first 6 months of the US vaccination pro - gramme, when more than 298 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were administered, to better characterise the safety profile of mRNA vaccines. Methods VAERS VAERS is a national spontaneous reporting system for detecting potential adverse events for authorised or licensed US vaccines. 8 VAERS is co-administered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US FDA. VAERS accepts reports from health-care providers and other members of the public primarily through online submissions and from vaccine manufacturers through electronic transmissions. The volume of mail, fax, and telephone reports is trivial compared with public online and manufacturer electronic submissions. Reports include information about the vaccinated person, type of vaccine administered, and adverse events experienced. A VAERS report can be submitted for any event experienced following receipt of a vaccine. We included all VAERS reports that were submitted for US residents who received mRNA vaccines and processed from Dec 14, 2020, to June 14, 2021, including any interval from vaccination to event report. Processed reports were quality checked, and submitted text on the adverse event was coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. 8 Each VAERS report was assigned at least one and possibly more than one MedDRA preferred term; preferred terms do not necessarily indicate medically confirmed diagnoses and they include signs and symptoms of illness and the ordering and results of diagnostic tests. Based on the Code of Federal Regulations, 15 VAERS reports were classified as serious if any of the following outcomes were documented: inpatient hospitalisation, prolongation of hospitalisation, permanent disability, life-threatening illness, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or death. Prespecified adverse events of special interest were selected for enhanced monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine safety on the basis of biological plausibility, previous vaccine safety experience, and theoretical concerns related to COVID-19, such as vaccine-mediated enhanced disease. 16 VAERS staff requested death certificates and autopsy reports for reports of death. CDC physicians reviewed VAERS reports and available death certificates for each death to form an impression about cause of death. Impressions were assigned to one of the following categories: one of the 15 most common diagnostic categories from the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, reported on US death certificates, 17 COVID-19 related, other (ie, impression was not included in prespecified categories), or unknown or unclear if not enough information were available to determine a cause of death. V-safe V-safe is a voluntary smartphone-based system that uses text messaging and secure web-based surveys to actively monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety for common local injection-site and systemic reactions. 9 V-safe participants receive text messages that link to web-based health check-in surveys following vaccination, initially daily Research in context Evidence before this study We searched PubMed for articles published up to Dec 29, 2021, using the terms (\"BNT162b2\" OR \"mRNA-1273\" OR effects\" OR \"health impact\"), not restricted by language or type of publication. Among 429 results, few publications described health impacts following vaccination by BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna). Available literature included reports of manufacturer-sponsored phase 1-3 clinical trials, observational and cross-sectional studies among specific groups (eg, transplant recipients or employees of a specific health-care system), and reviews or society recommendations that discussed reactogenicity and adverse events following mRNA vaccination. Added value of this study In this large, observational study, we assessed reactogenicity, health impacts, and adverse events reported following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination during the first 6 months of the US vaccination programme to one active (v-safe) and one passive (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) surveillance system. We found that reported reactions to mRNA vaccination were mostly mild in severity and transient in duration, and most reports were non-serious. Reactions and health impacts were reported more frequently in female than in male recipients, and in individuals younger than 65 years than in older individuals. Information on health impacts for individuals from v-safe is presented here for the first time. Implications of all the available evidence The findings from two complementary surveillance systems from the first 6 months of mRNA vaccine administration in the USA are consistent with pre-authorisation clinical trials and early post-authorisation reports. On the basis of our findings, mild-to-moderate transient reactogenicity should be anticipated, particularly among younger and female vaccine recipients. Vaccine safety data collected by the US monitoring systems will be used to update the benefit-risk assessments for COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.Articleswww.thelancet.com/infection Published online March 7, 2022 https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00054-8 3(days 0 -7), then at longer intervals after vaccination. The system resets to the initial survey frequency after entry of another dose. We analysed survey reports from days 0-7 for reactogenicity, severity (mild, moderate, or severe), 9 and health impacts (ie, unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, or received care from a medical professional) that were submitted to v-safe between Dec 14, 2020, and June 14, 2021. Participants who reported receiving medical care were contacted and VAERS reports were completed, if clinically indicated. Data analysis We conducted descriptive analyses of available VAERS and v-safe data following dose one and dose two of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines among individuals aged at least 16 years. We stratified analyses by sex, age group, race and ethnicity, serious versus non-serious reports, and vaccine manufacturer; and for death reports, by time from vaccination to death (ie, onset interval) and cause of death. Reporting rates to VAERS were calculated for adverse events using the number of doses of mRNA vaccines administered during the 6-month period as the denominator. COVID-19 vaccine administration data were provided through CDC's COVID-19 Data Tracker. 18 V-safe participants who responded to at least one health check-in survey during days 0-7 after vaccination were included in analyses. Descriptive statistics were calculated for participants' characteristics (sex, age, and race and ethnicity), reaction (type and severity) and health impact by manufacturer, dose number, and number of days following vaccination. Analyses were done using SAS (version 9.4). Both VAERS and v-safe conduct surveillance as a public health function and are exempt from institutional review board review. Activities were reviewed by the CDC and done in accordance with applicable federal law and CDC policy. Role of the funding source Authors from the CDC, the funder, were responsible for study design, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report. Results From Dec 14, 2020, to June 14, 2021, 298 792 852 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the USA: 167 177 332 were BNT162b2 and 131 639 515 were mRNA-1273 (appendix p 2). A greater proportion of vaccines was administered to females (155 969 573 [53 \u00b72%]) than to males (134 373 958 [45 \u00b78%]). The median age at vaccination was 50 years (IQR 33-65) for BNT162b2 and 56 years (39-68) for mRNA-1273. 112 698 875 (38 \u00b74%) recipients were non-Hispanic White. Race and ethnicity was unknown for 102 227 532 (34 \u00b79%) of all vaccine recipients. During the study period, VAERS received and processed 340 522 reports: 164 669 following BNT162b2 and 175 816 following mRNA-1273 vaccination (table 1). Of these reports, 313 499 (92 \u00b71%) were classified as non-serious; 22 527 (6 \u00b76%) were serious, not resulting in death; and 4496 (1\u00b73%) were deaths (table 1). 246 085 (72 \u00b73%) reports were among female participants and 154 171 (45 \u00b73%) reports were among those aged 18-49 years; median age was 50 years (IQR 36-64; table 1). 169 877 (49\u00b79%) of those reporting race or ethnicity identified as non-Hispanic White, and for 75 334 (22 \u00b71%) race and ethnicity were For more on federal regulations see https://www.ecfr.gov/ current/title-45 Both (91\u00b74%) 162 977 (92\u00b77%) Serious, including death27 023 (7\u00b79%) 14 183 (8\u00b76%) 12 839 (7\u00b73%) Serious, excluding death 22 527 (6\u00b76%) 587 (70\u00b78%) 129 475 (73\u00b76%) Male 88 311 (25\u00b79%) 45 (2\u00b71%) Race or ethnicityHispanic or Latino 23 480 (6\u00b79%) 11 217 (6\u00b78%) 12 260 (7\u00b70%) Non-Hispanic White 169 877 (49\u00b79%) 73 398 (44\u00b76%) Native 375 (0\u00b72%) Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander105 (<0\u00b71%) 56 (<0\u00b71%) (<0\u00b71%) Multiple and 334 (22\u00b71%) 42 320 (25\u00b77%) 32 999 (18\u00b78%) (Table 1 continues on next page)See Online for appendix Articles4 www.thelancet.com/infection Published online March 7, 2022 https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00054-8unknown (table 1). The most common MedDRA preferred terms assigned to non-serious reports were headache (64 064 [20 \u00b74%] of 313 499), fatigue (52 048 [16 023 [16 \u00b73%]), \u00b77%]), and pain (47 745 [15 \u00b72%]; table 1). The most common MedDRA preferred terms assigned to serious reports were dyspnoea (4175 The reporting rate to VAERS was 1049 \u00b72 non-serious reports per million vaccine doses, and 90 \u00b74 serious reports per million doses (table 2). Among the prespecified adverse events of special interest, reporting rates ranged from 0\u00b71 narcolepsy reports per million doses administered to 31\u00b73 reports of COVID-19 disease per million doses administered (table 2). 4496 reports of death were made to VAERS following receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (table 3). After review by clinical staff, 25 reports were excluded because of miscoding of death or duplicate reporting. Of the 4471 reports of deaths analysed, 2086 (46 \u00b77%) were reported \u00b73%) following mRNA-1273. 1906 (42\u00b7 6%) deaths were in female vaccine recipients and 2485 (55\u00b76%) were in male recipients; the median age of participants who died was 76 years (IQR 66-86; table 3). 3647 (81\u00b76%) deaths were reported among individuals aged 60 years or older (table 3). 821 (18 \u00b74%) deaths were identified as being in long-term care-facility residents. Time to death following vaccination was available for 4118 (92 \u00b71%) reports; median time was 10\u00b70 days (IQR 3-25). The greatest number of death reports occurred on day 1 (470 [11 \u00b74%] of 4118) and day 2 (312 [7\u00b7 6%] 4118) following vaccination (appendix p 10). Death certificates or autopsy reports were available for clinical review for 808 (18\u00b71%) of 4471 reports of deaths. Among these, causes of death were most commonly diseases of the heart (376 [46 \u00b75%]) and COVID-19 (102 [12\u00b76%]; appendix pp 3-4). Among the 3663 reports of death without a death certificate or autopsy, causes of death were most commonly unknown or unclear (1984 [54\u00b72%]), diseases of the heart (621 [17 \u00b70%]), and COVID-19 (317 [8\u00b77%]; appendix pp 3-4). Causes of death among reports with death certificate or autopsy reports available are shown by age in appendix p 5. During the study period, 7 914 583 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine recipients enrolled in v-safe after dose one or dose two and completed at least one post-vaccination health survey during days 0-7 (table 4). The median age of v-safe participants was 50 years (IQR 36-63), 4 975 209 (62 \u00b79%) were female, 2 860 738 (36\u00b71%) were male, and 4 701 715 (59 \u00b74%) identified as non-Hispanic White (table 4). 6 775 515 participants completed at least one survey during days 0-7 after dose one (table 5). Of these participants, 4 644 989 (68 \u00b76%) reported a local injection- site reaction and 3 573 429 (52 \u00b77%) reported a systemic reaction (table 5). Of the 5 674 420 participants who completed surveys after dose two, 4 068 447 (71 \u00b77%) reported an injection-site reaction and 4 018 920 (70 \u00b78%) a systemic reaction (table 5). Local injection-site reactions were reported more frequently after mRNA-1273 than after BNT162b2 (table 5). A similar pattern was found for systemic reactions after mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 (table 5). The most frequently reported events after dose one of either mRNA vaccine included injection-site pain, fatigue, and headache, which were also more frequent after dose two than after dose one (table 5). Differences in proportions of reactogenicity by dose number were similar after stratifying by age (<65 vs 65 years) and sex (appendix p 6). More reactogenicity was reported among participants younger than 65 years than older participants and by female participants than male participants (appendix p 6). Local and systemic reactions stratified by manufacturer, dose, days after vaccination, and severity are shown in the figure. Most reported symptoms were mild (figure). Participants reported moderate and severe reactogenicity most commonly on day 1 after dose two of either mRNA vaccine (figure).

Table 5: Local and systemic reactions and health impacts following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines reported during days 0-7 after vaccination to v-safe, by manufacturer and doseArticles8 www.thelancet.com/infection Published online March 7, 2022 https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00054-8when over 298 million doses of mRNA vaccines were administered, we found that reactogenicity was similar to what was reported from clinical trials and from early post-authorisation monitoring. 3-5,10,11 In both VAERS and v-safe, local injection-site and systemic reactions were commonly reported. V-safe participants more frequently reported transient reactions following mRNA-1273 than following BNT162b2, and more frequently following dose two of either vaccine compared with after dose one. Female participants and individuals younger than 65 years reported adverse events and reactions more frequently than male participants and those aged 65 years and older, respectively. Reporting rates for death were higher in older age groups, as expected on the basis of general age-specific mortality in the general adult population. Safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines has been the most comprehensive in US history and has used established systems, including the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), 20 VAERS, and a new system, v-safe, developed specifically for monitoring COVID-19 vaccine safety. During the study period, all COVID-19 vaccines were administered under EUAs, which require vaccine providers to report all serious adverse events (including deaths) that occur after vaccination to VAERS, regardless of whether they were plausibly associated with vaccination. Heightened public awareness of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, outreach and education to health-care providers and hospitals about COVID-19 EUA reporting requirements for adverse events, and adherence to EUA reporting requirements by providers and health systems, probably all contributed to the high volume of VAERS reports received. Data from US safety monitoring systems for all COVID-19 vaccines authorised or approved by the FDA have been reviewed regularly by the ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Safety Technical Work Group 21 and at public ACIP meetings.22 Similar to reports following receipt of other vaccines routinely administered to adults, most VAERS reports following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination were non-serious. 23-26 Serious adverse events detected in VAERS and VSD27 surveillance prompted specific safety evaluations for anaphylaxis,14 thrombosis with syndrome,28 of anaphylaxis following mRNA vaccination with both vaccines, clinical guidance and management recommendations were updated. 31 Also during this time period, a safety signal for myocarditis was identified and investigated further in VAERS and other US safety systems. 32,33 Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome28 Janssen's COV2.S adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine but not with mRNA vaccines. ACIP has conducted several benefit-risk assessments for each of the authorised or approved US COVID-19 vaccines; 22,28-30 these assess - ments have resulted in several modifications to clinical guidance and a preferential recommendation for mRNA vaccines. 31Figure: Local and systemic reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines reported to v-safe, by manufacturer, dose, days after vaccination, and severity Figure shows top reactions by reported frequency, after showing by dose number and by manufacturer. These top six reactions were determined by reported frequency after dose two of both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in v-safe, excluding fever because it was not rated mild, moderate, or severe. Mild was defined as \"noticeable symptoms but they aren't a problem\", moderate as \"symptoms that limit normal activities\", and severe as \"make normal daily activities difficult or impossible\".BNT162b2 vaccine dose 1 0Participants (%) 102030405060708090100BNT162b2 vaccine dose 2 01234567012345670 Injection-site painFatigue Headache Myalgia Days since last dose Days since last doseChills Joint pain1234567012345670123456701234567mRNA-1273 vaccine dose 1 0Participants SevereArticleswww.thelancet.com/infection Published online March 7, 2022 https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00054-8 9Reactogenicity findings following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination from VAERS and v-safe data are similar to those from a large study in the UK.34 The observed patterns might be explained in part by host characteristics known to influence reactogenicity, including age, sex, and the presence of underlying medical conditions. 35 Female recipients have more vigorous antibody responses 36 to certain vaccines and also tend to report more severe local and systemic reactions to influenza vaccine, compared with male recipients. 37 Female recipients might also be more likely than male recipients to respond to surveys. 38,39 Younger people might be more comfortable with smartphone-based surveys and more likely to respond to surveys generally. 40,41 Using v-safe data, we were able to assess the effects of mRNA vaccination on daily-life activities among vaccine recipients for the first time for a vaccine administered in the USA. These effects were most frequently reported on day 1 after vaccination. Reports about the measures of health impacts used in v-safe, although self-assessed and subjective, correlate with reports about reactogenicity: more health impacts were reported by female than by male recipients, by participants younger than 65 years compared with older participants, after dose two compared with dose one, and by those who received mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2. Reports of seeking medical care after mRNA vaccine were rare; v-safe surveys did not ask which symptoms prompted the participant to seek medical care. Reactogenicity and its associated health impacts, even if transient, might deter some from seeking vaccination. Surveys found that nearly half of unvaccinated adults younger than 50 years expressed concern about missing work because of vaccine side-effects and that employees who were given paid leave were more likely to get vaccinated than were those without paid leave; 42 employer policies that accommodate such leave might increase vaccination coverage. 43 In our review and analysis of death reports to VAERS following mRNA vaccination, we found no unusual patterns in cause of death among the death reports received. Under the COVID-19 vaccine EUA regulations, health-care providers are required to report deaths and life-threatening adverse health events after COVID-19 vaccinations to VAERS regardless of their potential association with vaccination. These requirements make comparing the number of reported deaths to VAERS for COVID-19 vaccines with reported deaths following other adult vaccines 44 difficult because no other adult vaccines have been so widely administered under FDA EUAs. Initially, US COVID-19 vaccination was prioritised for individuals aged 65 years and older and those in long-term care facilities. 7 These populations have the highest baseline mortality risk, complicating comparisons with mortality reporting for other adult vaccines. Similar to general mortality in the adult population, 45 reporting rates for deaths in this analysis increased with increasing age. The concentrated reporting of deaths on the first few days after vaccination follows patterns similar to those observed for other adult vaccinations. 46 This pattern might represent reporting bias because the likelihood to report a serious adverse event might increase when it occurs in close temporal proximity to vaccination. There are limitations in any review of preliminary data concerning reports of death following vaccination. A comparison with national mortality data 45 suggests that certain causes of death, such as accidents, suicides, or cancer, are less likely to be reported to VAERS. Underreporting to VAERS, in general, is expected. 8 The predominance of heart disease as a cause of death reported to VAERS warrants continued monitoring and assessment but might be driven by non-specific causes, such as cardiac arrest, that might be chosen as a terminal event if no immediate explanation for death was available. Death certificate or autopsy reports were available for only a small proportion of deaths reported to VAERS when our analyses were conducted. Finally, VAERS is designed as an early warning system to detect potential safety signals, 8 and VAERS data alone generally cannot establish causal relationships between vaccination and adverse events. Another surveillance system, the VSD, showed no increased risk of non-COVID-19 mortality in vaccinated people. 47 This study has several strengths, including the large population under surveillance and the comprehensive capture of national data from two complementary surveillance systems. Because the US Government purchased all COVID-19 doses and collected administration data, we were able to calculate VAERS reporting rates using the number of mRNA vaccine doses administered as denominators. 18 By contrast, VAERS analyses for non-COVID-19 vaccines rely on doses distributed, not administered. Because the number of doses distributed is greater than that of doses administered, these past VAERS analyses are likely to underestimate reporting rates of vaccine-related adverse events. Information from v-safe about how reactogenicity during the week after mRNA vaccination affects daily activities and work is novel and provides new insights. An important limitation of this report is one shared by all VAERS analyses: we used data from a passive reporting system subject to underreporting and variable or incomplete reporting. 8 Although VAERS death reports were individually reviewed by CDC physicians and follow-up is ongoing to obtain additional and missing records, other reports of serious adverse events were not individually reviewed. Additionally, VAERS reports require interpretation to identify whether reports meet clinical case definitions. 48 A limitation of v-safe is the need for smartphone access. Because a subset of all vaccine recipients participated in v-safe, the results are unlikely to be generalisable to the entire vaccinated US population. Other differences might exist among Articles10 www.thelancet.com/infection Published online March 7, 2022 https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00054-8participants who received mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccines that were unaccounted for; therefore, v-safe cannot be used to draw conclusions that one mRNA vaccine type is more reactogenic than the other. Additionally, participants in v-safe might be lost to follow-up because continuous enrolment is not required. Finally, this report only included v-safe responses received during the first week after vaccination. During the first 6 months of the US COVID-19 vaccination programme, more than 50% of the eligible population received at least one vaccine dose. 19 VAERS and v-safe data from this period show a post-authorisation safety profile for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that is generally consistent with pre-authorisation trials 3,4 and early post-authorisation surveillance reports.10,11 Serious adverse events, including myocarditis, have been identified following mRNA vaccinations; however, these events are rare. Vaccines are the most effective tool to prevent serious COVID-19 disease outcomes 49 and the benefits of immunisation in preventing serious morbidity and mortality strongly favour vaccination. 28-30 VAERS and v-safe, two complementary surveillance systems, will continue to provide data needed to inform policy makers, immunisation providers, other health-care professionals, and the public about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination.
