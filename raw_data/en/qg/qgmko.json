A car cuts me off or theres some other egregious act, and my hands tighten on the wheel as my blood pressure rises. Thats a good time to take a couple of deep breaths and wish peace and well -being to the offender. Plant something and care for it. Spend time with nature. This can be as simple as leaving my iPod home and taking a leisurely stroll in my neighbor- hood, allowing all of my senses to work. The last items on the list are to notice how I feel with each change, and if I like that feeling, to continue my program into the fall. A time to sow and a time to reap. Enjoy your summer. The biblical passage that Pete Seeger put to music and the Byrds made a part of our lives resonates with us: To everything there is a sea- son. Why does it feel like theres just a busy season, that were always going in fast mo- tion? Summer can be a time to catch up and put some things in order that we dont have time for during the rest of our year. Our schedules may ease up enough that theres a chance to get our heads above water. For each of us, its not hard to create a list of things we would like to do. Here are some that are on my list: Tell and show the people who are im- portant to me how much they mean to me. Pick an activity that Ive wanted to do but doesnt come easily. Invest some time and energy in it and see what hap- pens. This is taking the form of a three - day biking trip with my son. Mindfully eat a meal from time to time without TV, newspaper, or distractions. Go a week with packing my lunches and if I do eat out, choose the healthier op- tion. Give my liver a chance to rid my body of toxins without adding new ones. Take to heart the expression, \"Count your blessings.\" Disconnect from the grid. Have a period each day, as well as longer stretches on occasion, when Im not in contact with the electronic world. Im not the greatest with meditation or contemplative practice. But Ill try to take a few minutes each day when I bring my multitasking down to two or perhaps only one item at a time, and at rare moments, zero. Read a couple of the novels that Ive had lined up.
