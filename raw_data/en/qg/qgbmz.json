Starting April 15, 2022, community members can get free COVID-19 vaccinations at [OHSU Health pharmacies](https://www.ohsu.edu/health/vaccine-scheduling-snks) and through OHSU-organized [community vaccination events](https://www.ohsu.edu/health/vaccine-scheduling-ycuo). Starting March 14, 2022, OHSU patients and community members can also get free COVID-19 testing at OHSU immediate care clinics on its South Waterfront campus and in Beaverton. [See our ](https://www.ohsu.edu/health/coronavirus-resources) [COVID-19 vaccine resource page](https://www.ohsu.edu/health/covid-19-vaccines-information-and-appointments) for more information. As part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring all Oregonians have access to COVID-19 vaccination and testing, Oregon Health & Science University is opening two new community vaccination and testing sites in Portland, and is transitioning another site's management to the Oregon Health Authority. Combined, OHSU's two new sites will add about 1,100 more tests and 1,000 more vaccinations per week for the general public, including OHSU patients. Drive-through, appointment-only testing will begin Wednesday, Jan. 19, on OHSU's Marquam Hill campus, and indoor, appointment-only vaccinations will begin Monday, Jan. 24, inside a clinic on OHSU's South Waterfront campus. Both sites will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, and will continue to require appointments to limit wait times. At the same time, management of the drive-through community testing and vaccination site at the Portland Expo Center, which OHSU has operated since March 2020, is transitioning. OHSU's last day at that site will be Friday, Jan. 14, and the Oregon Health Authority will begin operating it Monday, Jan. 24. \"OHSU is grateful for the state's continued partnership as we work together to protect the health of Oregonians during this pandemic,\" said OHSU Vice President of Ambulatory Care Kevin O'Boyle, M.H.S.A. \"OHA generously offered to manage the Portland Expo Center testing and vaccination site after OHSU has operated it for nearly two years. As we hand over the baton for the Expo Center site and prepare to open two other community sites, we are proud that both organizations' efforts will collectively expand the vaccination and testing options.\" OHSU is contacting those who have appointments at the Expo Center after Friday, Jan. 14, to offer rescheduling options. OHSU is also working closely with the OHA to ensure Spanish, Russian and other language services will continue to be available to individuals visiting the Expo Center site. Online appointments for OHSU's new community sites can be made through the [OHSU COVID-19 Resources for Oregon website](https://www.ohsu.edu/health/coronavirus-resources). Appointments for the new testing site will be posted online starting this Friday, Jan. 14 (click the yellow \"COVID tests\" button at the page's top left corner), while appointments for the new vaccination site will be made available starting Wednesday, Jan. 19 (click a yellow \"Find a vaccine\" button). The new South Waterfront vaccination site is in addition to the [COVID-19 vaccination services](https://www.ohsu.edu/health/covid-19-vaccines-information-and-appointments) that are already offered on an appointment-only basis at OHSU pharmacies, through weekend clinics held on Marquam Hill, and during OHSU primary care appointments. OHSU's Vaccine Equity Committee and its community partners also organize walk-in [community vaccination events](https://www.ohsu.edu/health/vaccine-scheduling-ycuo) throughout the Portland area.
