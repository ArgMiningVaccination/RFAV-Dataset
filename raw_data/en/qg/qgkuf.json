Food cooperatives (coop) can promote the accessibility to healthier foods and thus improve the health of the population, particularly in remote rural communities. Objective: To measure the effects of implementing a food coop in a disadvantaged community with poor access to food. We have two main research questions: (1). Does the establishment of a food coop in rural areas described as food deserts have an impact on accessibility, frequency of use, food consumption, food quality, and ultimately the health of individuals? (2). Does the establishment of a food coop in rural areas described as food deserts have an impact on food security and community vitality? Design: A natural experiment with a mixed pre/post method will be used. The sample is composed of households that came from geographically isolated communities (population: 215 to 885 inhabitants) which qualified as food deserts and located in rural areas of Quebec (Canada). All communities plan to open a food coop (in the years 2022-2023), and as their opening will be staggered over time, participants from communities with a new food coop (intervention) will be compared to communities awaiting the opening of their food coop (control). Data collection was carried out at three time points: (1) before; (2) 1 to 5 months after; and (3) 13 to 17 months after the opening of the coop. Questionnaires were used to measure sociodemographic variables, dietary intake, residents' health, and community vitality. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with community stakeholders. Results: Few natural experiments have been conducted regarding the impact of implementing food coops. Gathering concrete data on the effectiveness and processes surrounding these interventions through natural experiments will help to quantify their impact and guide knowledge users and policymakers to make more informed decisions.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-04-14", "cleaned_text": "Implementing a Rural Natural Experiment: A Protocol for Evaluating the Impacts of Food Coops on Food Consumption, Resident's Health and Preventing chronic diseases and overweight requires reducing energy intake and improving the food quality of the population [ [6](#B6-mps-05-00033)]. This is especially true for people with low income who have been shown to have poorer diets [ [7](#B7-mps-05-00033), [8](#B8-mps-05-00033)]. [9](#B9-mps-05-00033)]. For a community to be food secure, the following four conditions must be present: availability of food, physical and economic access to food, use of food, and stability in the presence of the three previous conditions [ [9](#B9-mps-05-00033)]. Many rural communities in Quebec are food insecure because of limited or no access to food [ [10](#B10-mps-05-00033)]. [11](#B11-mps-05-00033), [12](#B12-mps-05-00033), [13](#B13-mps-05-00033)]. Interventions to improve the population's diet, therefore, require a portfolio of multi-targeted and multi-level strategies [ [14](#B14-mps-05-00033)], including those aimed at improving the local food environment (LFE) [ [15](#B15-mps-05-00033), [16](#B16-mps-05-00033), [17](#B17-mps-05-00033)]. The LFE is defined by the food supply (location and accessibility to several types of food stores) in municipalities and neighborhoods [ [18](#B18-mps-05-00033)]. [19](#B19-mps-05-00033), [20](#B20-mps-05-00033), [21](#B21-mps-05-00033), [22](#B22-mps-05-00033), [23](#B23-mps-05-00033)]. Public health organizations recognize the importance of developing or consolidating an LFE conducive to adopting and maintaining a healthy diet [ [24](#B24-mps-05-00033), [25](#B25-mps-05-00033), [26](#B26-mps-05-00033)]. Promising interventions can be divided into the following four categories: (1) opening of conventional sources of supply (e.g., supermarkets) [ [27](#B27-mps-05-00033), [28](#B28-mps-05-00033), [29](#B29-mps-05-00033), [30](#B30-mps-05-00033), [31](#B31-mps-05-00033)] or alternative sources of supply (e.g., solidarity grocery shops, public markets, and mobile markets) [ [32](#B32-mps-05-00033), [33](#B33-mps-05-00033), [34](#B34-mps-05-00033), [35](#B35-mps-05-00033), [36](#B36-mps-05-00033), [37](#B37-mps-05-00033)], (2) modifying the food stores (e.g., \"healthy\" convenience stores programs) [ [38](#B38-mps-05-00033), [39](#B39-mps-05-00033)], (3) land-use planning (e.g., zoning) [ [40](#B40-mps-05-00033)] and (4) support for mobility (transport infrastructure) [ [41](#B41-mps-05-00033)]. [29](#B29-mps-05-00033), [30](#B30-mps-05-00033), [37](#B37-mps-05-00033), [42](#B42-mps-05-00033)]. In Canada, opening a food coop in a food desert in Saskatoon has made it possible to reach households with lower incomes living nearby who bought more fruit and vegetables and fewer processed products than those living further away [ [43](#B43-mps-05-00033), [44](#B44-mps-05-00033)]. Research and evaluation around these initiatives is greatly needed [ [19](#B19-mps-05-00033), [45](#B45-mps-05-00033), [46](#B46-mps-05-00033), [47](#B47-mps-05-00033)], especially in rural areas that are typically characterized by a low population density and the presence of few food stores that propose a lower variety of foods that are of lesser quality and affordability [ [48](#B48-mps-05-00033)]. [37](#B37-mps-05-00033), [42](#B42-mps-05-00033), [43](#B43-mps-05-00033)]. The conclusions of these studies are hardly transferable to rural areas because of the type of interventions and the differences in LFE. In the wake of movements to transform food systems at the local level [ [49](#B49-mps-05-00033), [50](#B50-mps-05-00033)] and according to our community partners, the establishment of social economy enterprises such as food cooperatives would be a promising strategy to counter food deserts and improve the health of rural populations notably through community vitality [ [40](#B40-mps-05-00033), [51](#B51-mps-05-00033), [52](#B52-mps-05-00033), [53](#B53-mps-05-00033)]. Food cooperatives were targeted as most small rural areas do not have large enough populations to make a privately-owned food store economically viable. [54](#B54-mps-05-00033)] guided the development of the research objectives for this project. A logic model ( [Figure S1 in Supplementary](#app1-mps-05-00033)) was developed to capture the diversity and complexity of the potential food and health effects of establishing a food cooperative. The logic model was constructed following the guide proposed by the Canadian National Collaborating Centre for Healthy Public Policy [ [55](#B55-mps-05-00033)]. The main objective of this project is to assess changes in the local food environment on the health and vitality of the communities involved. We have two main research questions: (1). Does the establishment of a food coop in rural areas described as food deserts have an impact on accessibility, frequency of use, food consumption, food quality, and ultimately the health of individuals? (household level) (2). Does the establishment of a food coop in rural areas described as food deserts have an impact on food security and community vitality? (community level). Our first hypothesis is that the implementation of a food cooperative in areas qualified as food deserts will contribute to improving access to healthy food, the frequentation of this type of business will be greater, which will promote an increase in the consumption of healthy food, increase the quality of the food consumed and in the long term, will improve the health of the population. The second hypothesis is that the implementation of a food cooperative will contribute to increasing community food security and will help to increase the vitality of the communities. - Objective 1: - Evaluate the effects of the food cooperative on food consumption, residents' health, and community vitality; - Objective 2: - Document the mobilization of community actors before and after the implementation of the food cooperative; - Objective 3: - Evaluate the effects of the intervention on food accessibility, use of the food cooperative, and food supply in the local environment; - Objective 4: - Analyze the socioeconomic and community contexts of the implementation of a food cooperative; - Objective 5: - Implement an integrated knowledge translation process (iKT) to improve practices throughout the project. 2. Experimental Design [56](#B56-mps-05-00033), [57](#B57-mps-05-00033), [58](#B58-mps-05-00033)]. The natural experiment under study is the establishment of a food coop in rural remote communities. The opening dates, size, or type of foods sold in these coops are not under the control of the researchers [ [59](#B59-mps-05-00033)]. The communities of Rivi\u00e8re-Saint-Jean and Magpie, Gallix and Rivi\u00e8re-Pentec\u00f4te located in the C\u00f4te-Nord (Qu\u00e9bec) region were identified in collaboration with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des coop\u00e9ratives d'alimentation du Qu\u00e9bec (Quebec's food cooperative federation), a provincial organization supporting food cooperative projects [ [60](#B60-mps-05-00033)]. The C\u00f4te-Nord region is a large region of the province of Qu\u00e9bec bordered by the Saint-Laurence river which is sparsely populated and located 850 km north east of Montr\u00e9al. The communities were selected as they are projected to open a food coop in 2021-2023, have low physical access to stores offering healthy food (supermarkets, grocery shops), and include disadvantaged socio-economics sectors ( [Figure 1](#mps-05-00033-f001)). 2.1. Rivi\u00e8re-Pentec\u00f4te [61](#B61-mps-05-00033)]. The inhabitants of Rivi\u00e8re-Pentec\u00f4te live on average more than 6 km away from a grocery store. In the community, a convenience store-style food coop has been in operation for about 15 years. It offers staples, ready-to-eat meals, and fresh produce on-demand and to order. This coop is in the process of relocating due to its outdated location. The move is planned for 2022. 2.2. Gallix [61](#B61-mps-05-00033)]. The inhabitants of Gallix live on average more than 19 km away from a grocery store. Gallix does not have a food service point. A project is underway to create and set up a food cooperative. The interim committee would like to see fresh produce and ready-to-eat meals sold at the cooperative. They also want to integrate a coffee corner as well as a gas and propane station. 2.3. Rivi\u00e8re Saint-Jean and Magpie [61](#B61-mps-05-00033)]. The inhabitants of Rivi\u00e8re Saint-Jean and Magpie live on average more than 22 km away from a grocery store. A provisional committee is working on a project for a food cooperative that resembles a grocery outlet, and which will annex a gas station. [Figure 2](#mps-05-00033-f002)): - Prepare data collection tools; - Interview key informants (n = 2-3/community) from the selected communities and other organizations involved in the implementation of food cooperatives (n = 3-4) before the implementation of the coops (T0) using semi-structured interviews. The key informants from the selected communities will be interviewed again in T1 or T2 to further understand the process of community mobilization; - Collect information on the socio-economic characteristics and food environment of the selected communities; - Integrated knowledge translation process (iKT). 3. Procedure 3.1. Quantitative Data one-tailed t-test (equivalent to an F-test) on the coefficient of the exposure variable, 12 categories or levels distributed among the covariates, an alpha threshold of 0.95, and a statistical power level of 0.9. A sample size of 105 in the intervention community and in the control community (105 households) would be sufficient to detect a small effect size ( = 0.06). This calculation considers an attrition rate (non-response and abandonment combined) of 50% at time T1 and does not depend on the choice of the exposure variable [ [67](#B67-mps-05-00033), [68](#B68-mps-05-00033)]. Considering only fruit and vegetable consumption and assuming a standard deviation of 1.78 for the difference in consumption, the sample size specified would correspond approximately to an effect size of 0.2 servings per day [ [30](#B30-mps-05-00033)]. Our study, therefore, requires an almost exhaustive survey of the chosen communities. This should not be a problem because quasi-exhaustive sampling is often performed in the context of small rural communities [ [69](#B69-mps-05-00033)]. 3.1.3. Recruitment and Retention of Participants [70](#B70-mps-05-00033)] or with similar objectives [ [71](#B71-mps-05-00033)]. Participants will be recruited via a Facebook campaign, polling firm, and local newspapers in which the person responsible for food purchases will subsequently fill out the questionnaire. Informed consent will be obtained at the beginning of the questionnaire after participants are made aware of the details of the research project ( [File S2 in Supplementary](#app1-mps-05-00033)). Recruitment and retention of study participants are essential in the case of a natural experiment with a quasi-experimental design [ [67](#B67-mps-05-00033)] but can be challenging in rural communities [ [68](#B68-mps-05-00033), [72](#B72-mps-05-00033)]. Three recruitment and retention strategies that are known to be effective in rural areas will be used to maximize participant retention [ [68](#B68-mps-05-00033)]: - Community engagement: This will be facilitated by our iKT approach which includes communication with municipal and public health authorities and the region's healthy living collaborative structures as research stakeholders. - Increase awareness, knowledge, and understanding of the research: At the beginning of data collection (T0), a campaign to promote the research to citizens will be conducted through local and social media and at popular community locations (e.g., community centers, churches, post offices, gas stations). The objective is to recruit participants, explain the purpose of the research and the process, and the role of local and regional authorities in the project. This campaign will also enhance the profile of the project and research team [ [70](#B70-mps-05-00033)]. - Social and financial supports for participants: Regular contact with participants through reminder letters and greeting cards will also be part of the retention strategies. Several studies have shown that financial incentives can improve the recruitment and retention of survey participants, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. We, therefore, plan to use this strategy to facilitate recruitment and to increase the retention of participants [ [67](#B67-mps-05-00033), [73](#B73-mps-05-00033), [74](#B74-mps-05-00033)]. The value of financial retribution to participants will be gradual and as follows: T0: $25, T1: $30, T2: $35. By adopting these strategies and based on the results of various studies, we foresee a retention rate of 70% at T1 and 50% at T2 [ [67](#B67-mps-05-00033), S3 in Supplementary](#app1-mps-05-00033)). 3.1.4. Dependent, Independent, and Covariables Primary Dependent Variable Secondary Dependent Variables - Community vitality and well-being will be measured using a combination of three measures of community vitality [ [80](#B80-mps-05-00033), [81](#B81-mps-05-00033), [82](#B82-mps-05-00033)] and well-being. The final scale resulted in 19 questions on community resilience, citizen participation, community pride, and sustainable development. Questions will be answered on three or five-point Likert scales. A reliability analysis will be performed on the scale using lambda-6 [ [83](#B83-mps-05-00033)]; - Weight and height: one question on weight and one question on height will be used to calculate participants' BMI. Independent Respondent Variables - Adult household food insecurity: The Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) focuses on self-reports of uncertain, insufficient, or inadequate food access, availability, and utilization due to limited financial resources, and any compromised eating patterns and food consumption that may result. The HFSSM contains 18 questions about the food security situation in the household over the previous 12 months. Each question specifies a lack of money or the ability to afford food as the reason for the condition or behavior. The questions range in severity from worrying about running out of food, to children not eating for a whole day. Only questions that are specific to the experiences of adults in the household or the household in general (Adult Scale) will be used in this study [ [87](#B87-mps-05-00033)]. Independent Community Variables [88](#B88-mps-05-00033)]. To characterize communities socioeconomically, data from the 2016 INSPQ Deprivation Index will be used [ [89](#B89-mps-05-00033)]. The tool for auditing the community's businesses, which was validated for supermarkets, must be adjusted for the context of smaller food stores [ [88](#B88-mps-05-00033)]. The analyses will be repeated at T1 and T2, although in some instances no new data will be available at these data collection points as data are typically not collected every year. Covariables [90](#B90-mps-05-00033)] or Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) [ [91](#B91-mps-05-00033)] and will include age, housing tenure, marital status, gender, household income, education, number of children in the household, and modes of transportation used to purchase food. 3.1.5. Data Protection and Management 3.2. Qualitative Data [53](#B53-mps-05-00033)], and thus for gathering a variety of views, realities, and issues. Key informants will be interviewed (semi-structured interview) before the opening of the cooperative and again following the opening to assess their views on the implementation process and to explore their perceived impact of the cooperative on the community. The key informants will be met with once for a semi-structured interview before the opening of the cooperative and then again following the opening of their cooperative, to assess their point of view on the implementation process and to explore their perceived impact of the cooperative on the community. Two members of the research team will be present during the interviews as one will guide the interview while the other will take notes. The interviews will last approximately one hour and will be conducted via videoconference or telephone. 3.2.1. Recruitment of Key Informants 3.2.2. Interview Guide [File S4 in Supplementary](#app1-mps-05-00033)) and will be adapted to the interviewee and his or her role in the cooperative project. The construction of the interview guide is inspired by the work of Billion [ [92](#B92-mps-05-00033)] on the role of trade and distribution actors in territorial food governance processes. We also introduced sections related to the local food security context to explore the role of alternative businesses on food security [ [93](#B93-mps-05-00033)]. Additionally, several aspects of intersectoral collaboration (concertation in French) stated in Fortier's reference framework [ [94](#B94-mps-05-00033)] are also probed in the interview guide. Thus, it provides guidance for the key informants to discuss their role in the cooperative project, the needs that led to its development, the process and the steps to be carried out, the cooperative's characteristics, community mobilization, and the required intersectoral collaboration among partners. The following topics will also be addressed: facilitating factors and barriers in implementing the cooperative, the cooperative's impacts on the community and the citizens, and, finally, the measures put into place to ensure the sustainability of the cooperative. Open-ended questions will be asked so as not to direct the interviewer's answers (e.g., In your opinion, what are the most important elements that explain why the cooperative project is progressing well?). 3.3. Analytical Strategies 3.3.1. Quantitative Analysis [28](#B28-mps-05-00033)] which is a \"principle of comparing participants according to the treatment (coop) they were originally randomly assigned to, regardless of the treatment they received\" [ [95](#B95-mps-05-00033)] (Obj. 2 et 3). The double-difference model is a recognized method for assessing the impact of new food retail locations on diet and health with an IG and a CG [ [28](#B28-mps-05-00033), [30](#B30-mps-05-00033), [96](#B96-mps-05-00033), [97](#B97-mps-05-00033), [98](#B98-mps-05-00033)]. First, comparability analyses between the two groups will be performed at T0. Means and standard deviations for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables will be calculated. Subsequently, measures of mean differences will be calculated for each dependent variable between the values at T0, T1, and T2 for the IG and the CG. Estimates will be calculated from the double-difference model, which will be applied to measure the evolution between T0, T1, and T2 [ [30](#B30-mps-05-00033)]: [30](#B30-mps-05-00033)]. The regression model will be weighted to account for sample attrition between T0, T1, and T2 and to ensure that the results are generalizable to the T0 sample [ [97](#B97-mps-05-00033)]. The weights are equal to the inverse probability of response at T1 and will be estimated using logistic regression [ [97](#B97-mps-05-00033)]. Multiple imputations will be used to perform the analyses with all participants who have been subject to data collection at T0, T1, and T2 [ [99](#B99-mps-05-00033), [100](#B100-mps-05-00033)]. All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4 3.3.2. Qualitative Analysis [101](#B101-mps-05-00033)]. Triangulation will be carried out using data collected via meetings with local partners and co-researchers [ [101](#B101-mps-05-00033)]. 3.4. Integrated Knowledge Translation Process (iKT) [102](#B102-mps-05-00033)]. 4. Limits [103](#B103-mps-05-00033), [104](#B104-mps-05-00033), [105](#B105-mps-05-00033)]. For example, the frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption could be over-reported. 5. Expected Results - Draw up portraits of their community's food environment (presence of food deserts, level of physical accessibility, food insecurity, community vitality); - Take stock of socio-economic characteristics, food consumption, and food insecurity of the communities; - Evaluate the effects of the implementation of their food cooperative; - Illustrate, through examples from the communities, the mobilization process, the conditions for success, and the pitfalls to be anticipated when implementing a food cooperative.
