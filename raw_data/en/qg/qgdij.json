Chiropractic is based on a holistic approach to health without drugs or surgery Your experience with us may be different than your previous chiropractic experiences. Our doctors use specific techniques and the most advanced chiropractic technology to measure and correct imbalances in the body. Adjustments are often made with the use of an instrument. With our technology called the ProAdjuster, the resistance and placement of each vertebra is measured independently, and in relation to each other, allowing the doctors to precisely adjust only the specific vertebrae that needs correction. Only a very light amount of pressure is used with our adjustments. We also utilize the Palmer Method of Manual Adjusting to specifically correct those misaligned areas of the spine in a more traditional manner. The entire spine is also evaluated with a series of comprehensive nervous system exams before any adjustment is made. This will allow the doctors to determine exactly where an adjustment will promote the optimal correction of the nervous system. "}
