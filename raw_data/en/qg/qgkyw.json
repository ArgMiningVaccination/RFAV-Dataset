Afflicted for nearly 10 years with lymphocytic hypophysitis, a rare, incurable disease of the endocrine system that depresses immunity, the 43-year-old woman had become increasingly debilitated by pain and depression, conditions that persisted despite medication. Acknowledging their limitations, her endocrinologist and her psychiatrist referred her to another kind of healer -- a practitioner whose treatments were meditation and yoga. \"It seemed off-the-wall,\" says Bettez, a former proofreader in Westminster, Mass. \"I'm going to sit around and meditate and that's going to make me feel better?\" Because the healer her physicians recommended was not some robed mystic but a professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts in Worcester, she decided to enroll in his program last spring. Since completing it, Bettez reports, she has been able to cut down on Naprosyn, an anti-inflammatory medication that helps alleviate her pain, and stop taking Ativan for her depression. \"This has been a godsend.\" In recent years, unconventional therapies such as meditation, acupuncture and homeopathy have begun to gain a foothold in American medicine. Catherine Bettez is one of millions of patients who have been treated with such methods, and her physicians are among the thousands of doctors who either refer patients to practitioners of alternative medicine or use elements of it themselves. This year, the National Institutes of Health established an Office for the Study of Unconventional Medical Practices to investigate a wide range of treatments, including herbal medicine and massage therapy. Next year, Harvard Medical School plans to offer a course on unorthodox medicine. Similar courses and lectures are already available to medical students at Georgetown University, the University of Louisville, the University of Arizona and the University of Massachusetts in Worcester. Dr. David M. Eisenberg, an instructor of medicine who persuaded Harvard to offer the course after having studied acupuncture in China, says his purpose was not only to introduce students to the theory and practice of alternative treatments but also to train students \"to think rigorously about them.\" Acupuncture, a mainstay of Chinese medicine for thousands of years, came to Westerners' attention about 20 years ago, when China opened its doors to the modern world. American doctors were intrigued by the use of acupuncture as a surgical anesthetic, and researchers found that it works by inducing nerve cells to produce endorphins, the body's natural painkillers. Scientists have also found evidence to support the view, held by many cultures, that illness can be brought on not only by external forces, like viruses, but by one's state of mind. Stress seems to weaken the immune system and happiness to strengthen it. Personality traits such as impatience increase the risk of heart disease. Studies show that meditation and other \"mind-body\" therapies confer various benefits, including reduced pain and, for infertile women, a higher conception rate. Many physicians now speak of a transition from the narrow biomedical model of Western medicine to a \"biopsychosocial\" one. With this approach, doctors would continue to marshal the tools of Western medicine to do what it does best: save the life of a patient who is acutely ill or in critical condition, by pumping him full of antibiotics when he has pneumonia, for example, or mending his skull after it has been shattered in a car accident. Doctors would also draw on holistic techniques to help prevent killer illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer, and to treat chronic conditions such as pain, hypertension and anxiety -- problems that often do not yield to high-tech medicine. Patients would then have the healer's touch and, if necessary, the MRI. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF JON KABAT-ZINN, a professor of medicine, the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester has taught Buddhist meditation and yoga to thousands of patients, most of whom have been referred by physicians. At one recent class there were 30 patients whose ailments included AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hypertension, chronic back pain, anxiety disorder, gastrointestinal distress, coronary artery disease and cancer. Outcomes studies show that most patients who go through Kabat-Zinn's eight-week program feel much better than they did before, regardless of their illnesses. \"They're taking people that the system is not helping. They're taking the toughest patients and having significant outcomes,\" says Dr. John K. Zawacki, a gastroenterologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. About 40 miles east, at Deaconess Hospital in Boston, is the Harvard-affiliated Mind/Body Medical Institute, founded in 1988 by Dr. Herbert Benson, a cardiologist at Harvard Medical School. The institute uses meditation, repetitive exercise and yoga to achieve what Dr. Benson calls the relaxation response, a physiological state characterized by lowered blood pressure, heart rate, respiration and metabolism that was the subject of his best-selling book of the same name. The institute offers programs for cardiac risk reduction and rehabilitation, infertility, insomnia, chronic pain, AIDS and cancer. Cures are not promised. Patients can, however, hope for a reduction in symptoms, or at least a greater ability to cope with serious medical conditions as well as with treatments (such as chemotherapy) that can be both psychologically and physically debilitating. Dr. Benson has demonstrated the success of his methods in several clinical studies. One published last year in the journal Fertility and Sterility showed that women receiving medical treatment for infertility who also went through his infertility program had about a 35 percent conception rate, compared with a roughly 17 percent rate among women who got only medical treatment. A study last year in The Clinical Journal of Pain found that after going through Dr. Benson's chronic pain program, people didn't feel the need to go to the doctor as often -- the number of visits was reduced by an average of 38 percent. And a study published in the Journal of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation found that patients who had completed his hypertension program showed reductions in blood pressure, anxiety and depression. RELAXATION TECHNIQUES as well as other alternative therapies such as biofeedback are now routinely taught to patients at medical centers and doctors' offices around the country. More than 2,000 physicians use acupuncture in conjunction with conventional medicine, according to the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, and 5,000 use hypnotherapy, according to the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. Dana Ullman, a board member of the National Center for Homeopathy, estimates that more than 1,000 doctors practice homeopathy. Alternative therapies have a reputation for being less expensive than conventional medicine, since practitioners prescribe fewer drugs and recommend fewer diagnostic tests and other costly interventions, and because they typically spend more time with patients than regular doctors do. But the fees charged by practitioners of unconventional medicine can be high. An initial consultation with a physician, a nurse or some other certified practitioner of homeopathy costs $60 to $300, depending on the location, although the visit lasts about an hour and a half, says Dr. William Shevin, president of the National Center for Homeopathy. Subsequent half-hour visits range from $45 to $80. Acupuncturists charge $50 to $100, says Dr. Joseph M. Helms, president of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture. Jon Kabat-Zinn's stress-reduction program runs $565 for nine sessions, and Dr. Benson's programs cost an average of $1,000 for 10 classes. Insurance reimbursement for unconventional medicine varies by the policy, the therapy, the practitioner and the geographical region. Catherine Bettez's insurance policy covered most of the fee for Kabat-Zinn's relaxation program, and another patient, Ken Hokanson, says his policy covered all of it. Six states -- California, Florida, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon -- require insurers to reimburse patients who see licensed acupuncturists for pain relief. And in Alaska, the services of licensed naturopaths, practitioners who treat disease with nonmedical approaches such as diet and exercise rather than drugs and surgery, must be covered. SOME INSURANCE Companies impose their own standards. The American Western Life Insurance Company in California, a $60 million insurer with 300,000 clients, recently launched a \"wellness and preventative care health plan,\" which reimburses patients for alternative therapies such as homeopathy, herbal medicine, shiatsu massage, acupressure, acupuncture, guided imagery, hypnotherapy and biofeedback. But American Western is clearly the exception. Many major companies, including the Prudential Insurance Company of America and the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, two multibillion-dollar insurers, cover alternative therapies only if a medical doctor or a licensed practitioner performs them. A therapy must also be deemed medically necessary by the insurance company's own doctors. \"It has to be documented to be an effective and safe intervention, not just prescribed by a doctor or provided by a physician,\" says Dr. I. Steven Udvarhelyi, vice president of medical services at Prudential, which covers meditation, biofeedback, acupuncture and shiatsu massage, but not hypnotherapy. \"We base our coverage decisions on a careful and extensive review of the medical literature. We also consider the consensus opinion within the medical community.\" THE MEDICAL COMMUNIty's willingness to accept some alternative therapies has been strengthened by a few ground-breaking studies. In 1990, Dr. Dean Ornish, director of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, Calif., published a study in The Lancet showing that techniques such as yoga and meditation, when used in conjunction with a low-fat diet, can reverse coronary heart disease, actually reducing the amount of plaque in the arteries. A year earlier, also in The Lancet, Dr. David Spiegel, a psychiatrist at Stanford University School of Medicine, demonstrated that women with metastatic breast cancer who got medical care as well as \"psychosocial treatment\" -- including support groups and self-hypnosis -- survived twice as long as patients who received only medical care. These studies \"added significantly to the cumulative evidence that emotions and behaviors can influence physical health,\" says Dr. Halsted R. Holman, a professor of medicine at Stanford. Scores of other studies have suggested a link between emotions or attitudes and physical health. For example, a report last year in The New England Journal of Medicine found that stress increases a person's chances of catching a cold. Other research has shown that particular alternative therapies are effective against certain ailments. Homeopathic remedies can relieve headaches, colds, flu and allergies, according to several European studies. And a recent article in The Lancet concluded that a traditional Chinese herbal therapy reduces the symptoms of dermatitis. AS THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE supporting various unconventional treatments accumulates, some physicians predict nothing less than the transformation of American medicine, from a biomedical model to a biopsychosocial one. Dr. Joel Elkes, professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of Louisville, believes that within 25 years mind-body techniques will permeate medical practice, from primary care to the treatment of such illnesses as cancer and heart disease. The integration of approaches such as meditation, yoga, acupuncture and biofeedback with drugs and surgery, he says, \"will be as important to medicine as the discovery of antibiotics.\" \"I think that's possible,\" says Dr. Arnold S. Relman, former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine who now teaches at Harvard Medical School and is writing a book on the health care system. \"But it all depends on whether we can get more scientific evidence.\" Like Dr. Relman, other gatekeepers of American medicine remain skeptical about much of the research on alternative treatments. Dr. Marcia Angell, executive editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, thinks many of the studies have been poorly designed and \"characterized by exuberant interpretation.\" Some scientists studying the interaction between the mind and the body are themselves skeptics, who say their work is often erroneously used by practitioners -- including many physicians -- as justification for alternative therapies. \"I resent being cited as the scientific basis for protocols and approaches that have never been tested scientifically,\" says Dr. David L. Felten, a leading researcher in the new field of psycho neuroimmunology, the study of the connection between the mind and the body's susceptibility to disease. Dr. Felten, a professor of neurobiology and anatomy at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, who received a MacArthur fellowship in 1983, has been working out the \"hard wiring\" of mind-body communication. His research has helped uncover a fascinating network of communication pathways between the body's endocrine, immune and nervous systems -- a sort of physiological Rosetta stone. This network reveals that neurotransmitters, immune cells and hormones act as messengers between our thoughts and emotions and our immune defenses. WHAT everyone wants to know is which alternative therapies really work. Many medical practices that are widely accepted today met stiff opposition from the medical establishment when they were first introduced. Doctors initially doubted the need to wash their hands before performing surgery to prevent infection, for example, as well as the benefits of anesthesia. More recently, the value of acupuncture has been questioned. \"People thought acupuncture was way out, spooky, flimflam, a few generations ago,\" Dr. Relman says. \"But there appears to be convincing evidence that it can relieve or prevent pain, and now it's more respected.\" Some of the resistance to alternative therapies is giving way as more scientists study them. \"The champions of alternative medicine shouldn't expect to be believed unless they meet rigorous standards,\" he adds. \"But on the other side, the traditional biomedical establishment ought not to prejudge. All biases and prejudices ought to fall before the evidence.\"Alternative Medicine Lexicon Acupuncture: An ancient Chinese practice that involves inserting thin needles into the body at various points and manipulating them to relieve pain or treat illnesses.Biofeedback: A technique for teaching people to become awareof their heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and other involuntary body functions in order to control them by a conscious mental effort.Herbal medicine: The use of balms and medications prepared from flowers, leaves and other parts of plants.Homeopathy: A medical system based on the idea of treating disease by using minute, highly diluted doses of the very substances that, in large doses, can cause it.Hypnotherapy: A method of inducing a trancelike state characterized by extreme suggestibility in order to help patients relax, control pain and overcome addictions such as smoking.Naturopathy: An approach to treating illness with diet, exercise and other \"natural\" means, rather than drugs or surgery.Guided Imagery: The use of mental imagery to facilitate the healing process.Milestone 1971: The opening of China tothe modern world and a New York Times article by JAMES RESTON about his experience with acupuncture stimulated interest in Chinese medicine among American physicians and the general public.1974: \"Type A Behavior and Your Heart,\" a best seller by two cardiologists, Drs.
