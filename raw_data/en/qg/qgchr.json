The FDA is urging consumers not to use these or similar products because they have not been evaluated by the FDA to be safe or effective for their intended use and may be harmful. The warning letters were issued to: [Essential Elements](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/essential-elements-636305-11142022) (Scale Media [Anabolic Laboratories, LLC](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/anabolic-laboratories-inc-636308-11142022). \"Given that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., it's important that the FDA protect the public from products and companies that make unlawful claims to treat it. Dietary supplements that claim to cure, treat, mitigate or prevent cardiovascular disease and related conditions could potentially harm consumers who use these products instead of seeking safe and effective FDA-approved treatments from qualified health care providers,\" said Cara Welch, Ph.D., director of the Office of Dietary Supplement Programs in the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"We encourage consumers to remain vigilant when shopping online or in stores to avoid purchasing products that could put their health at risk.\" Under the FD&C Act, products intended to diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease are drugs and are subject to the requirements that apply to drugs, even if they are labeled as dietary supplements. Unlike drugs approved by the FDA, the agency has not evaluated whether the unapproved products subject to the warning letters announced today are effective for their intended use, what the proper dosage might be, how they could interact with FDA-approved drugs or other substances, or whether they have dangerous side effects or other safety concerns. The FDA advises consumers to talk to their doctor, pharmacist or other health care provider before deciding to purchase or use any dietary supplement or drug. Some supplements might interact with medicines or other supplements. Health care providers will work with patients to determine which treatment is the best option for their condition. If a consumer thinks that a product might have caused a reaction or an illness, they should immediately stop using the product and contact their health care provider. The FDA encourages health care providers and consumers to report any adverse reactions associated with FDA-regulated products to the agency using [MedWatch](https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program) or the [Safety Reporting Portal](https://www.safetyreporting.hhs.gov/SRP2/en/Home.aspx?sid=706a0b15-5fc2-4a92-beca-c56ac7661bd4). The FDA has requested responses from the companies within 15 working days stating how they will address the issues described in the warning letters or provide their reasoning and supporting information as to why they think the products are not in violation of the law. Failure to correct violations promptly may result in legal action, including product seizure and/or injunction.
