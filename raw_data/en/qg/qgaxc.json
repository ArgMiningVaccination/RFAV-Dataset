Experimental studieshave repeatedly demonstrated that viral immune escape variants emerge more often fromimmunized hosts than from naive hosts. This empirical relationship between host immunestatus and within-host immune escape is not fully understood theoretically, nor has its impact on antigenic evolution at the population level been evaluated. Here, we show that this relationship can be understood as a trade-off between the probability that a new antigenicvariant is produced and the level of viraemia it reaches within a host. Scaling up this intra-hostlevel trade-off to a simple population level model, we obtain a distribution for variantpersistence times that is consistent with influenza A /H3N2 antigenic variant data. At the within-host level, our results show that target cell limitation, or a functional equivalent, provides a parsimonious explanation for how host immune status drives the generation of immune escape mutants. At the population level, our analysis also offers an alternativeexplanation for the observed tempo of antigenic evolution, namely that the production rateof immune escape variants is driven by the accumulation of herd immunity. Overall, our resultssuggest that disease control strategies should be further assessed by considering the impact thatincreased immunity\u2014through vaccination\u2014has on the viral evolution; intra-host dynamics; immune escape 1. INTRODUCTION Many important infectious diseases of humans as well as non-human animals are caused by pathogens exhibit- ing antigenic variation. Some, such as malaria and dengue, consist of antigenically distinct, co-circulatingstrains that persist in a population over time.In others, antigenic variants appear de novo, resultingin the turnover of viral lineages or the accumulationof viral diversity. This de novo production of antigenicvariants is observed especially in acute, semi-immunizing infectious pathogens such as influenza viruses, corona- viruses, norovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus(FMDV). Understanding these patterns of viral anti-genic variation has been a major topic of theoreticalinterest, and has led to a well-established understandingof the role of host immunity at the population level in selecting for antigenic strains [ 1-4]. However, the role of host immune status, dened as a host's prior immu-nity to an infecting strain, acquired through eithervaccination or natural infection, in generating antigenic variants at the within-host level is still not well under-stood, despite experimental evidence clearly indicating that it is an important factor [ 5-10]. Support for the importance of host immune status in driving within-host antigenic change comes frommultiple passage experiments. In one experiment,influenza strains Puerto Rico 8 (PR8) and 965 werepassaged through chick embryos in either the absenceor presence of partially immunizing antisera (gure 1 a)[5]. The strain passaged in the presence of antisera evolved to be antigenically distinct from theoriginal strain, whereas the strain passaged in theabsence of antisera did not. In a similar series ofexperiments, PR8 was passaged through either non-vaccinated or homologously vaccinated mice [ 6-8]. The conclusions were consistent with the earlier nd- ings in chick embryos: strains passaged seriallythrough vaccinated mice demonstrated immuneescape, whereas no such escape was detected in serialpassages through naive mice ( gure 1 b). A recent study revisiting these experiments reported similarresults ( gure 1 c(i)) for correspondence ( szl@math.duke.edu ).

These experiments indicate that host immune status prior to challenge plays a role in the production ofimmune escape variants, and that this may be a generalphenomenon across antigenically variable viruses. However, the specic physiological and immunological processes underlying this relationship are still not wellunderstood. A major theoretical contribution towardsits understanding was developed by Grenfell et al. [11], wherein the authors hypothesized a hump-shaped curve relating the strength of host immunity to the rate of immune escape. The increasing portion of this curve is consistent with data from the passage exper-iments reviewed earlier. The decreasing portion is notdirectly observed possibly because hosts with strongimmunity may be asymptomatic and because the occur-rence of immune escape in a strongly immune host would be rare and unlikely to be captured in an exper- imental setting. The authors used a population geneticsmodel to demonstrate that the hump-shaped curve isthe result of two opposing effects of host immunity.At higher levels of host immunity, selection pressurefor immune escape increases, thus increasing the x-ation rate of escape mutations. However, at higher levels of host immunity, viral abundance also decreases, lowering the overall number of mutants that arise. Here, using an alternative approach in which intra- host dynamics are explicitly modelled, we derive asimilar nonlinear curve relating immune status andhost immune escape. Not only does this result support the general hypothesis of Grenfell and colleagues, but it additionally provides a mechanistic understandingof how immune status impacts immune escape. Such a mechanistic description of intra-host immune escape allows us to make specic predictions which can be tested in experimental settings. When we scale up thisrelationship between immune status and within-hostimmune escape to the population level, we ndtemporal patterns of antigenic evolution that arequalitatively consistent with that observed for influenzaA antigenic variants in humans but which arise from a mechanism different from that hypothesized in previous studies [ 4,12-14]. 2. THE EFFECT OF IMMUNE STATUS ON THE PRODUCTION OF IMMUNEESCAPE VARIANTS We use a model of intra-host viral dynamics that cap- tures key physiological and immunological processes to, rst, understand the possible mechanisms throughwhich host immune status affects immune escape,and, second, derive a general relationship betweenhost immune status and the production of escape var-iants. Our model builds on existing intra-host modelsfor influenza and similar acutely infecting diseases [15-24] by within-host viral antigenic evol- ution and cross-immunity between variants. We assume an infection is seeded by a single anti- genic viral strain and is initially driven by theinteraction of target cells and free viral particles ofthe infecting\u2014henceforth also referred to as the resident\u2014strain. These initial dynamics are given by 048log2 log2 source of anti-sera hamster mouse FMDV Figure 1. Evidence for the relationship between immune status and immune escape.

Whilewe will refer to Cas the target cell population for most of this paper, it can be interpreted more generally,a point we will return to in the discussion. Host immune status is captured indirectly through the parameter dr, the neutralization rate of resident viral particles. For hosts naive to the resident strain, drreflects only the effects of innate immunity and a background rate of viral clearance. For hosts withsome level of immunity to the resident strain, eitherthrough vaccination or a previous infection with a cross-protective strain, drincludes the additional effect of the adaptive immune response on viral neutraliz-ation. When dr.gC0, the viral population decreases exponentially upon infection and we take these valuesof drto correspond to strong host immune status towards the resident strain. To reflect the stochastic nature of the mutation pro- cess, we simulate this model stochastically using amidpoint tau-leap algorithm [ 25]. We model only that affect antigenic properties of the virus.These antigenic mutants, which arise at rate mper virion, compete with the resident and other mutantstrains for target cells. We incorporate a mutant strain, denoted by V m1, by adding a depletion term to Cand by including a new equation for the dynamics of the new strain. For example, after the rst t,t/C3; where t* is the time the mutation occurs and dm1is the neutralization rate of virions of type m1. We assume, unless otherwise stated, that antigenic mutants comple-tely escape prior immunity so that the rate, dm, for all mutants reflects the innate immune response and abackground rate of viral clearance. This assumptionwill be weakened later. The dynamics continue in this way, with the potential emergence of V m2,Vm3and so on, until the infection has been cleared. We remark that host immune status to a particular strain is modelled by a constant clearance rate, forexample, dr,dm1, etc. The assumption that host immu- nity is constant for the duration of infection is based onobservations that antibodies produced in response to naive infections are usually not detected until viraemia load has peaked and are therefore unlikely to impactintra-host dynamics [ 16,26,27]. We also assume, in line with other models, that target cell replenishmentis negligible for the duration of infection [ 16,18,19,22]. Parametrized to capture influenza A viral load dynamics observed in volunteer studies ( gure 2 a)[19,28,29], this intra-host model yields dynamics that differ qualitatively between naive and immune hosts(gure 2 b,c) in a manner consistent with the results from passage experiments. These dynamics suggest that immune escape is not often observed in naive hosts because, in the absence of an adaptive immuneresponse, the resident infection rapidly depletes targetcells, leaving mutant strains insufcient resources togrow ( gure 2 b). Only the mutants that arise early in the infection have sufcient target cells for growth, but even these must compete with the more established resident strain for resources, thereby limiting their viralload. Instead, immune escape may occur more fre-quently in immune or partially immune hosts becausethe resident viral population is cleared rapidly, leavingample target cells to support an infection by a mutant variant, should one arise ( gure 2 c). In contrast, these dynamics are not observed in a model with a dynamically changing adaptive immuneresponse but without target _Vr\u00bc\u00f0b/C0d\u00deVr/C0eBrVr/C0mVr\u00f02:6\u00de and _Bmi\u00bcaVmi _Vmi\u00bc\u00f0b/C0d\u00deVmi/C0eBmiVmi/C0mVmi;\u00f02:7\u00de where Bris the B cell population corresponding to the resident variant and Bmiis the B cell population for mutant variant i.bis the replication rate of the virus, dis the background rate of viral clearance and eis the viral clearance rate due to B cells. These equationsassume that each B cell population grows linearlywith its corresponding viral population. Immune status is reflected in the initial population of B cells corresponding to the resident variant with B r(0)\u00bc0 in naive hosts. We assume no cross-immunity:B mi\u00f00\u00de\u00bc0 in all hosts for all mutants, although this assumption can be relaxed without changing theconclusions described in the next paragraph. This model, like the model given by equations (2.3)- (2.5), can also capture the viral load dynamics ofa single strain infection and does so with fewerassumptions about specic intra-host mechanisms(gure 2 d,e). We may therefore expect it to be sufcient for modelling immune escape dynamics. However,because there is no mechanism in this model that pre- vents mutant viral loads from reaching high levels, immune escape will occur more frequently in naivehosts than in immune hosts. This holds even in the pres-ence of cross-immunity because any cross-protectionthat suppresses mutant growth in naive hosts will alsosuppress mutants in hosts with prior immunity. This suggests that to be consistent with empirical obser- vations of immune escape, a minimal intra-host modelrequires a mechanism other than a dynamic antibodyresponse. Given that a target cell population is neces-sary for viral replication and has frequently beenincorporated in previous intra-host models [ 15-24] and given that its inclusion in the model describedThe impact of host immune status S.

Having established that a model that includes target cell limitation is minimal and consistent with empiricaldata, we use equations (2.1) and (2.2) to generalize theresults from gure 2 b,cand derive an explicit expressionrelating immune escape to host immune status. Central to our derivation is the calculation of the cumulative viral load\u2014that is, the area under the viral load curve,which we call the 'nal size' of a strain (appendix A).Ingure 3 a, we plot this for two initial target cell popu- lations over a range of values for host immune statuslevels to the resident strain, dr.

Dening immune escape to be the occurrence of an antigenic mutant followed by the growth of themutant to a sufcient nal size, gure 3 billustrates how the former is related to host immune status andgure 3 c, the latter. Thus, the product of the two curves yields the overall relationship between immune status and the generation of immune escape variants(gure 3 d). This relationship exhibits a trade-off between the probability of generating a mutant variantand the cumulative viral load that it can reach. Hostswith weak prior immunity (low dr) against the resident infection are more likely to generate a mutant variant due to higher viral abundance, but have fewer targetcells available for this new variant to increase to trans- missible levels. On the other hand, hosts with strong prior immunity (high dr) restrict viral abundance and thus the chance of generating a mutant variant, eventhough sufcient target cells are available for a mutantstrain to reach levels that would allow for transmission.Hosts with an intermediate level of prior immunity aremore likely than hosts with strong prior immunity to generate a mutant variant and also more likely than hosts with weak prior immunity to have thetarget cells available for a new variant to increase totransmissible levels. These hosts are therefore themain producers of antigenically novel variants.

Interface (2012) Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 January 2022 In other words, as long as there is some level of escape associated with mutations ( dm,dr), intermediately immune hosts will generate mutations more frequentlythan both naive and strongly immune hosts. 3. THE EFFECT OF IMMUNE STATUS ON POPULATION LEVEL PATTERNS OFANTIGENIC EVOLUTION Most theoretical studies of immune escape to date do not differentiate between hosts with respect to their ability to produce escape variants based on theirimmune status. In standard epidemiological models,mutations are assumed to arise from infected hosts atequal rates, regardless of immune status [ 2-4,14]. Con- sistent with the population genetics model of Grenfellet al. [11], our analysis indicates that new antigenic var- iants instead arise preferentially from infected individuals with an intermediate level of immunity tothe circulating strain. This raises the interesting question of whether con- sidering host populations that are heterogeneous intheir production of immune escape variants would yield predictions about the evolutionary processes of a pathogen that are different from existing population-level models. Here, we incorporate our within-hostresults qualitatively into a simple population levelmodel to investigate this question, specically withregard to the temporal patterns of antigenic evolution.We assume that there is one antigenic variant in thepopulation to which all hosts are initially naive and cal- culate the time until an escape variant emerges to replace the initial variant in the host population.We take this antigenic variant to be a family of geneti-cally different strains that are antigenically very similar.We assume, in line with passage experiments, that hostscan be reinfected with the same antigenic variant, and that each infection increases the immune status of the host. As illustrated schematically in gure 4 a, hosts evolve independently of one another: each susceptiblehost becomes infected at a constant force of infectionrate l, and each infected host recovers to be susceptible at a constant recovery rate n.A priori , immune escape is possible for every infected host. However, to incorporate the hump-shaped relationship between immune statusand immune escape ( gure 3 d), we assume that the rate of immune escape is zero in hosts that are infectedfor the rst time and in hosts that have beeninfected more than twice ( gure 4 b). With this model, we calculate the distribution of antigenic emergence times for a single individual and for the population (appendix B). Both distributionsare shown in gure 4 c, where the persistence time of a variant is equivalent to the time until emergence of anew escape variant. We note the distributions are notexponential, which implies that the rate of antigenic emergence is time inhomogeneous. New variants are unlikely to emerge early as most of the population isnaive. Over time, as more hosts become intermediatelyimmune (recovered from the rst infection), theprobability that a new antigenic variant arises will2 4 8 6 00.20.4 cluster persistence yr)proportion of clusters0.5 individual 0 1.0probability density ( \u00a510-2) 51 0 1 5 cluster persistence ( yr)\u00a510-4 4 08 population 123 ll lr2r3 Figure 4.

( c) Probability density for antigenic emergence at the level of the individual (dashed line, right axis) and at the population level (solid line, left axis).

We assume a popu- lation of one million hosts and that at the population level there is a 0.1% probability that an antigenic variant, once generated, is successfully transmitted through the population. ( d) Empirically derived distribution of variant persistence times for influenza A/H3N2 [ 30].2608 The impact of host immune status S. Luo et al. J. R. Soc. Interface (2012) Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 January 2022 increase. However, once the majority of the population becomes strongly immune (recovered from the secondinfection), this probability decreases. This distributionof variant persistent times is consistent with influenza A/H3N2 antigenic variant data ( gure 4 d)[30]. 4. DISCUSSION Numerous passage experiments have demonstrated that host prior immunity affects the probability that intra- host antigenic immune escape occurs ( gure 1 ). Here we use an intra-host model to investigate the mechan-isms underlying this phenomenon and to derive ageneral relationship between the prior immunity of ahost to a pathogen and the probability of immuneescape. We then consider the consequences of incorpor- ating such a relationship in the temporal patterns of antigenic evolution through a population level model.Although both models are simplications, they areuseful because they are mathematically tractable,provide insight into the key mechanisms involved inobserved phenomena and generate specic predictionsthat could be evaluated with further research. 4.1. Limitations of the intra-host model We have suggested here that target cell limitation is a natural and parsimonious choice for the mechanismthrough which immune pressure acts to produceescape variants. However, it is still unclear whether infections die out owing to the exhaustion of susceptible cells in the manner described in equations (2.1) and(2.2) [ 23]. It is likely, though, that viral access to suscep- tible cells can be limited, for example, becauseinterferons trigger antiviral responses in target cellsneighbouring the infection [ 23,31,32], or because the infection is spatially constrained [ 18]. While these pro- cesses are biologically distinct from target cell depletion, they are functionally similar with respect totheir role in intra-host dynamics and immune escape.Specically, they limit the size of the total viral popu-lation, regardless of the number of antigenic variantspresent in the infection. In this regard, even though the variable Cencodes the population of target cells, it may be interpreted more broadly as a functionallyequivalent mechanism without changing the main con-clusions of gure 3 . Another simplication we have made is to combine the effects of a multitude of adaptive immune systemprocesses into the parameter dr, which controls the clearance rate of the resident strain. This phenomeno- logical treatment succinctly captures the essentialcontribution that prior immunity makes to intra-hostdynamics: increased clearance, and thus lower nalsize, of the resident infection. It is this essential charac-teristic that leads to the curves derived in gure 3 . To the extent that more biologically accurate models also capture this characteristic, they should conrmthe conclusions from the model presented here. Simple by design, our intra-host model gives a clear conceptual description of the intra-host processes thatlead to immune escape. If one were interested in a more detailed characterization or in investigating a specicmechanism of within-host dynamics, it is straightforward to add these explicitly to the model. Such models can pro-vide quantitatively more precise predictions of intra-hostdynamics, though we expect the main ndings from our analysis to also hold in these cases. 4.2. Predictions for intra-host escape dynamics Our analysis demonstrates that the nonlinear relation- ship between immune status and immune escapearises from the confluence of two processes: target cell limitation, or a functional equivalent, and a differential antibody response dependent on host immune status(gure 3 d). The successful emergence of an escape var- iant depends not only on the likelihood of a mutationoccurring, which is negatively related to the immunestatus of the host, but also on the availability of resources for the escape variant, which is positively related to the immune status of the host. While thisgeneral idea has been demonstrated by Grenfell et al. [11] and supported by Volkov et al. [24], our dynamical systems approach provides a mechanistic understandingof this phenomenon and specic testable predictionsthat can further our understanding of intra-host immune escape. We also remark that the model of Volkov et al. may not be directly comparable to ours, as their parameter for immune response represents thestrength of antibody binding rather than the level ofprior immunity to an infection. As a specic example, consider the timing of mutation events, which is expected to be important in our model. Owing to the limited population of target cells availablefor virions to infect, a mutation that arises early will haveaccess to more target cells and thus have a greater chanceof escape ( gure 3 a) than a mutation that arises later. This effect is greatest in intermediately immune hosts.To test the importance of timing, one could challenge a host with a mutant strain thours after challenge with a wild-type strain. For intermediately immune hosts,we expect a lower tto lead to a greater chance of immune escape, owing to the selective advantage ofthe mutant and the increased availability of targetcells. For naive hosts, the probability of escape is not expected to increase with lower t, except in the case where tis very small. This is because a mutant strain has no selective advantage in a naive host; unless it isintroduced shortly after the initial challenge with thewild-type strain, it is unlikely to outcompete the equallyt and more established wild-type population. For fullyimmune hosts, we expect escape to occur regardless of tbecause the availability of target cells decreases only slightly over the time course of infection with thewild-type. Other predictions of our model include low within- host antigenic diversity and the binary nature of immuneescape. That is, given a population of partially immune infected hosts, we predict that one group will have little or no mutant viral load, while the othergroup will produce a mutant variant with a high viralload sufcient for transmission. This is alternative toa scenario where the mutant viral loads in an infectedpopulation are distributed, for example, as a normaldistribution. Evaluating these predictions requiresThe impact of host immune status S. Luo et al. 2609 J. R. Soc. Interface (2012) Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 January 2022 experiments where the antigenic composition of viral load is compared between hosts with varying levels ofimmune status. Past passage experiments providesome data, but these have concerned only naive or homologously vaccinated hosts [ 5-10]. Experiments where naive, intermediately immune and stronglyimmune hosts are challenged with a wild-type strain,and where the antigenic composition of their viralload is compared, for example, three days post infection,could be used to test our predictions concerning intra- host antigenic diversity and the binary nature of intra-host immune escape. 4.3. Limitations of the population level model Our work extends previous treatments of the relation- ship between immune status and immune response by scaling up within-host level results to the population level. Although our assumption that a host may be rein-fected with the same antigenic variant is in line with themethods used in passage experiments, in natural set-tings, it is more likely that hosts are infected with anantigenically similar strain to which they have partial immunity. We expect that the inferred temporal pat- terns of antigenic evolution under this latterscenario will be qualitatively similar to the results wepresent here. However, a proper theoretical investi-gation will require a multi-strain model, possiblyincorporating epidemic dynamics. This is a mathemat-ically and computationally more intensive task, which is beyond the goals of this work, but which certainly should be the subject of future studies. 4.4. Implications for vaccination policy As a rst step, the simple population-level model used here already provides an alternative explanation for the temporal pattern of antigenic emergence observed in influenza A /H3N2. The prevailing explanation for the non-exponential distribution of variant persistencetimes is that multiple mutations have to accumulateacross several epitopes for signicant antigenic changeto occur [ 4,12-14]. Here, we reproduce the observed temporal patterns of antigenic emergence solely from the dynamics of immunity accumulation in the hostpopulation. These two explanations, while not mutuallyexclusive, make different predictions. In particular, ifherd immunity accumulation is the main driver of anti-genic evolution, vaccination policies could affect therate at which antigenic variants originate. If vacci- nation leads to strong immunity, then the rate at which antigenic variants emerge would decrease signi-cantly, as there would be fewer infected individuals, andvaccinated individuals would not be sources of newantigenic variants. However, if vaccination only par-tially immunizes individuals, as is often the case for influenza, and provided the force of infection is con- stant, the rate at which new antigenic variants emergewould increase. This idea that vaccination couldchange the rate of antigenic evolution of influenza isalso implied by a study by Hensley et al. [10], where, under a different hypothesis for the origination of anti-genic escape mutants, they suggest that increasing thepaediatric vaccination rate might decrease the rate at which new antigenic variants emerge. Their study andours indicate that the impact vaccination may haveon the antigenic evolution of influenza should be a major consideration in disease control. In summary, the work presented here demonstrates that the inclusion of host immune status can qualitat-ively and quantitatively change the dynamics of viralantigenic evolution in theoretical disease models atboth intra-host and inter-host levels. It also highlights the need for further studies to understand how host immunity affects the within-host generation of immuneescape variants and how, at the population level, thisaggregate herd immunity impacts the origination ofnew antigenic strains. At the intra-host level, exper-iments that collect data on the antigenic properties of viral load for multiple levels of immune status could test the immunological and physiological processesthat lead to immune escape hypothesized here. At thepopulation level, data on vaccination policies and theantigenic evolution of pathogens such as influenzacould be analysed and closely monitored for patternsand correlations. The insights gained from these studies may lead to a better understanding of the evolution of antigenically varying pathogens as well as strategiesto more effectively control them.

APPENDIX A We rst calculate the nal size of a resident infection. Consider a single strain infection without mutation.Its dynamics are given by _C\u00bc/C0 bCV \u00f0A1\u00de and _V\u00bcgCV/C0dV \u00f0A2\u00de with initial conditions _V\u00f00\u00de\u00bcV0C\u00f00\u00de\u00bcC0: (We have dropped the subscript rfor clarity.) The equilibrium value of Vin this system is V\u00bc0, all viral particles die out, independent of initial conditions.The equilibrium value of C,C 1, depends on the initial conditions and the host's immune status, d. Different antibody responses, reflected in the value of d, lead to different numbers of target cells remaining. In parti- cular, for an immune individual, we take d.gC0, which corresponds to an initially decreasing viral popu-lation. Thus, many more target cells will remain forthis value of dthan for lower values of d. Because target cell replenishment occurs on a longer timescale, we are assuming in our calculations that Creaches2610 The impact of host immune status S. Luo et al. J. R. Soc. Interface (2012) Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 January 2022 its equilibrium value in the earlier-mentioned system before replenishment begins. From equation (A 1), we have _C C\u00bc/C0bV: The left-hand side of the equation is a perfect deriva- tive, so let A:\u00bc\u00d0 01V(t)dtbe the area under the viral load curve (i.e. the nal size of infection) and integrateboth sides from 0 to 1to get A\u00bc1 blogC0 C1/C18/C19 bdC dt\u00fed bd dtlogC; where we have used equation (A 1) to substitute for V. Again, we integrate from 0 to 1and use the fact that from the fact that A\u00bc/C0 \u00f0 1=b\u00delogC1=C0. To solve bC0/C0dA\u00feV0/C18/C19 \u00bc/C0g dC0\u00febA/C0b dV0: Plugging into equation and after some algebra, we get j\u00bcW0/C0g dC0e/C0\u00f0b=d\u00deV0/C0\u00f0g=d\u00deC0/C16/C17 ; where W0(x) is the upper branch of the Lambert W, or Product Log, function. It satises z\u00bcW0\u00f0z\u00deeW0\u00f0z\u00dewith the restriction W0(z).21. Plugging this back into our denition for jand solving A, we get A\u00bc1 bW0/C0g dC0e/C0\u00f0b=d\u00deV0/C0\u00f0g=d\u00deC0/C16/C17 \u00feb dV0\u00feg dC0/C20/C21 : It will be useful later to treat Aas a function of initial infection dose, initial target cell population and hostimmune status. Hence, we write A\u00bcA(v 0,c0,d), where the lower case v0andc0represent the initial viral load and target cell population as variables. In gure 3 a, we plot A, the nal size, for two initial target cell populations, over a range of host immune status, d. The other parameter values are: V0\u00bc105virions, C0\u00bc4/C2108cells, b\u00bc102,g\u00bc2/C21028. A sharp drop ( gure 3 ainset) in the nal size of a viral infection occurs at the host immunity level for which theresident viral load dynamics shift from initially growing (gure 2 b) to decaying ( gure 2 c).Assuming mutations do not signicantly interfere with the dynamics of the resident strain, the numberof mutations expected to occur during the course ofthe resident strain infection is given by mA\u00f0V0;C0;dr\u00de, where dris the immune status of the host towards the resident infection. We adjust this to include onlymutations that do not die out stochastically by aPoisson thinning [ 33]. The rate for such mutations, which we call R\u00f0 dr;dm\u00de(we have dropped the extra index on dm1for clarity), is given by R\u00f0dr;dm\u00de\u00bcm\u00f01 0V\u00f0t\u00deP\u00bdmutation with dm attsurvives jdr/C138dt: The initial dynamics of a mutant at t* can be approximated by a birth-death process with birthrate gC(t*) and death rate dm, where the dynamics of C(t) are given by equation (2.1). Here, as with most pathogens, the mutation rate is orders of magnitude less than the birth and death rates; so we ignore mutation events in this calculation. Our birth-deathchain approximation of the initial dynamics of amutant population implies P\u00bdmutation with dmattsurvives jdr/C138is 0 if dm.gC\u00f0t/C3\u00de(death rate . birth rate) and is 1 /C0dm=gC\u00f0t/C3\u00deifdm,gC\u00f0t/C3\u00de(birth rate,death rate). Since C(t) is decreasing in dm,gC\u00f0t\u00defor all tand R\u00f0dr;dm\u00de/C25m\u00f01 0V\u00f0t\u00de1/C0dm gC\u00f0t\u00de/C18/C19 dt: To evaluate this integral, we again use equation (A 1) and substitute in follows from the fact that the integrands are perfect derivatives in t.C0andC1 correspond to the target cell population dynamics given by equations (A 1) and (A 2). C1will depend on the host's immune status to the resident strain; reflected in the value of dr: C1\u00bcC0e/C0bA\u00f0V0;C0;dr\u00de; so R\u00f0dr;dm\u00de/C25mA\u00f0V0;C0;dr\u00de/C0dm bgC0\u00f0ebA\u00f0V0;C0;dr\u00de/C01\u00de/C26/C27 : Ifdm.gC1, then we need to integrate only up to the time twhen dm\u00bcgCt(because all mutations thatThe impact of host immune status S.

Interface (2012) Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 January 2022 occur after that do not stochastically die out occur at Ais monotonically decreasing indr. The probability that at least one such mutation occurs is thus 1 /C0e/C0R\u00f0dr;dm\u00deand is shown in gure 3 b. The expected nal size of a mutant infection can be calculated if we assume that the nal size formula forthe resident strain also applies approximately to themutant strain, but with initial viral load v 0\u00bc1 and c0\u00bcC(t), where tis the time of the mutation E\u00bdFm/C138\u00bc\u00f01 0A\u00f01;C\u00f0t\u00de;dm\u00deP\u00bdMtjM/C138dt; \u00f0A5\u00de where Fmis the nal size of a mutant, Mtis the event that a mutation occurs at time tandMis the event that a mutation ever occurs. However, this is a difcult integralto evaluate because we do not have a closed formexpression for C(t). Instead, E\u00bdF m/C138/C25A\u00f01;C1;dm\u00de; \u00f0A6\u00de where we have essentially assumed that C(t) is constant atC1\u00bcC0e/C0bA\u00f0V0;C0;dr\u00de, gives qualitatively the same result ( justication below) with much less computation. As illustrated in gure 3 c, this is a reasonable assumption that preserves the qualitative relationshipbetween immune status and a mutant strain's nalsize. At high values of dr, the resident infection is rapidly cleared, and C1is thus close to C0. At inter- mediate values of dr,C1will not be as close to C0; however, the relative error from our approximation is still minor and does not change the overallrelationship. At low drvalues, corresponding to naive or nearly naive hosts, C(t) can take values over a wide range. However, in this range of dr, any mutant strain faces strong competition from the established resident strain. Our assumption that a mutant strain hasaccess to all available target cells is thus too generous.The effective number of target cells available to themutant strain is much lower than the target cellsavailable at the time of mutation and C 1is a reasonable approximation.We note that, in simulations, when a host's immune status is low, a positive correlation exists betweenmutation rate and nal size ( gure 3 cinset). This is because with a higher mutation rate, the rst mutation is expected to occur earlier during the resident infection. At low immune levels, where target cells are depletedrapidly, a mutation that occurs early reaches a higherviral load than the one that occurs later. To obtain the overall relationship between immune status and immune escape ( gure 3 d), we multiply the probability of a mutation by the expected nal size of a mutation. APPENDIX B The states and transition rates of our Markov chain model are illustrated in gure 4 aand denoted in the gure legend. Let tbe the rst time a new antigenic variant is produced at the individual level. Let fTx denote the density function of Tx, an exponential random variable with rate parameter x. That is, fTx\u00f0t\u00de\u00bcxe/C0xt. Then ft\u00bcr r\u00fenfTl\u00feTn\u00feTl\u00feTn\u00fer; \u00f0B1\u00de where ris the same as r2ingure 4 .Tn\u00feris the time to leave state I2.Tl\u00feTn\u00feTl\u00feTn\u00feris the time for a host to go from state S0to either state 'escape' or S2. Thus, we multiply the expression by the probability our hosts ends up in state 'escape' rather than state S2:r/(r\u00fen). We assume that these exponential random variables are independent; so the density oftheir sum is Markov chain model, there is always a chance that a host does notproduce a new antigenic variant. This event corre-sponds to a mass of n=\u00f0 r\u00fel\u00deat innity for ft, which is not shown in gure 4 c. To extend this result to the population level, we assume that there is a xed population of size Nof hosts, and that individuals produce new antigenicvariants independently. We also assume that foreach new antigenic variant that is produced, it istransmitted through the population with probabilityu. Thus, the emergence time of an antigenic variant that avoids stochastic extinction has the same distri- bution as the minimum of Nindependently and with densityuf t[34]: Nuf t\u00f0t\u00de\u00f01/C0uFt\u00f0t\u00de\u00deN/C01; \u00f0B4\u00de where Ft(t) is the cumulative density function of ft(t). This is shown in gure 4 c(solid line).2612 The impact of host immune status S. Luo et al. J. R. Soc.
