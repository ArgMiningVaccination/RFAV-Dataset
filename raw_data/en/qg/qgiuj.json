Children/youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition. They usually require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally. In fact, children with special health care needs (ages 17 and under) account for 40% or more of medical expenditures for children overall*. A Personal Look at a Family in Nevada: \"My son was diagnosed with autism as a child, but did not receive the treatment he needed because my health insurance did not cover it and I didn't know where to go to look for help. When I contacted Family TIES, it changed my life. I have received a lot of support and information to help me with my son's transition services, guardianship, employment opportunities, and reviewing the different health care nancing options. When Family TIES connected me with another family that has a child with autism, it was a great relief. The support I received from this family was very important because they shared their experiences, their successes, and failures. I am very grateful and I thank Family TIES for helping us.\" By the Numbers: CSHCN in Nevada: Prevalence of Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN), among all children age 0-17 12.0% 82,108 % of CSHCN # of CSHCN Currently insured CSHCN whose insurance is inadequate 38.1 28,055 Impact of CSHCN on the Family: CSHCN whose families pay $1,000 or more out of pocket in medical expenses per year per child 26.5 21,235 CSHCN whose conditions cause nancial problems for the family 25.4 20,372 CSHCN whose families spend 11 or more hours per week providing or coordinating health care 15.3 11,500 CSHCN whose conditions cause family members to cut back or stop working 28.3 22,611 Impact on the Family*: CSHCN whose conditions cause nancial problems for the familyImpact on the Family*: CSHCN whose conditions cause family to cut back or stop working * National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs.
