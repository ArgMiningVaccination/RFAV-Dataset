In other words, as the overused quote from Game of Thrones goes, winter is coming, meaning it's also time to restock your over-the-counter cold medicine because flu season has arrived. But maybe this year you're not so keen on the de rigueur drowsiness that comes with cold and flu meds, or the sugary aftertaste of effervescent vitamin C tablets. If so, consider the power of plants to up your immunity and help you ward off infections. Yep, this is how to build a cold/flu season first aid kit with herbs. Remedies made from herbs and plants are full of powerful allies for your health and immunity, explains Sarah Corbett, a clinical herbalist at US apothecary Rowan and Sage - and science is starting to agree: \"Research is beginning to confirm the efficacy of folk medicines people have been using for hundreds of years,\" says Corbett. [So just what is flu, anyway?](https://www.scmp.com/better-life/well-being/article/3028207/what-flu-essential-facts-about-disease-formally-known?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) Here are six easy herbal medicines you can add to your medicine cabinet (or fridge, as it may be) for a prevention booster, or as a healing aid. (But first, get the power combo: herbs may give your immune system a little boost but nothing says wellness booster like the flu shot. Each year the flu shot is updated to help better fight viruses going around, because yes, the virus gets stronger - and so should you. Get your flu shot.) 1. Elderberry Chances are, you've already tried elderberry in some form or another, as this deep-purple berry has definitely gone mainstream in the past few years. Also called sambucus, elderberry is antifungal, antibacterial and antimicrobial, so it's good at knocking out any kind of crud you've got going on. There's evidence that elderberry is effective at treating the flu, as well. Corbett advises taking this remedy once per day if you're trying to prevent sickness, and then much more frequently once you're already sick - every few hours or so. Elderberry is considered safe, but don't chug a whole bottle or anything like that - a teaspoon to a tablespoon of syrup at a time will work. Keep syrups in the fridge, as they aren't shelf-stable. If you have any autoimmune disorders, it's probably best to stay away (because it stimulates the immune system). 2. Echinacea Another well known immune booster is echinacea, aka coneflower. It works by stimulating the immune system to produce natural killer cells and other sickness-fighters. A 2015 meta-analysis concluded that echinacea may benefit folks with low immune function the most, even reducing the risk for a cold up to 35 per cent. Corbett suggests echinacea is most effective used right when you start to feel that tickle at the back of your throat, rather than when a full-blown sickness has already taken hold. A tincture is the best way to take it, she says, but teas won't fail you either (especially since you'll be hydrating your system in the meantime). Look for Echinacea angustifolia or a whole plant extract, because it's the most chemically bioavailable (easily absorbed and used by the body).

If you have an autoimmune disorder, skip echinacea. 3. Ginger Yes, ginger will soothe an upset stomach, but it's also great for boosting your overall immunity during cold and flu season. It's pretty safe when used in cooking and remedies, but pregnant people shouldn't ingest more than 2 grams of dried ginger per day. 4. Garlic Garlic's powers go well beyond making food taste delicious. It's thought to stimulate the immune system and boost the efficacy of white blood cells, though studies are inconclusive. Garlic is really easy to use - eat it every day to keep yourself feeling top notch. Up your garlic intake when you're actually sick, too. Make a super garlicky soup (don't skimp on the bone broth, either), eat a couple of raw garlic cloves, roast a garlic bulb, or pack it into a jar of honey and let it sit for a few weeks to infuse. Dietary doses of garlic are pretty safe. It would be difficult to take enough to harm you, but if you're on anti-clotting medications, be cautious. (And brush your teeth if you find yourself going high on the hog with raw garlic, too!) 5. Fire cider This intense liquid, sometimes also called the Master Tonic, is kitchen medicine at its best: an intense mixture of garlic, ginger, onion, horseradish and hot peppers (plus any number of other immune-boosting ingredients like turmeric, or tasty ones like lemon or rosemary) marinated in apple cider vinegar. Fire cider gets its efficacy from the communal power of these sinus-clearing, warming, infection-fighting plants - plus an extra boost from the fermented vinegar. And yes, this immune brew will burn (in a good way!) going down. It's ridiculously easy to make, so whip up a batch and toss it on your salad every night, sprinkle it on rice or quinoa, or take a shot when you feel a cold coming on. If handcrafting isn't your jam, you should be able to find some from a local herbalist or at a natural food store. Steer clear if you have acid reflux or a history of stomach ulcers. 6. Adaptogens You've probably heard this wellness world buzzword in the last few years - adaptogens - but may not be clear on what exactly it means. Essentially, adaptogens are therapeutic herbs that support the body in combating and adapting to stress. They're great to use for people who get sick often, says Corbett, or in times of heavy stress, travel, or extra exposure to pathogens (rather than for every day maintenance or prevention).

Buy reishi as a powder and mix it into anything you're eating or drinking - it's safe to take in small doses (like a scoop of powder or a squirt of tincture). Ditto for ashwagandha - although steer clear if you're taking thyroid hormones like Synthroid. Holy basil can be made into an infusion and sweetened with honey (don't take it if you're pregnant, though, says Corbett). Research some other options, try a few, and see which ones work for you. How to make it really, really work Corbett explains that many people think that herbal remedies don't work, but that it's often because they aren't using enough. [5 delicious foods to boost your gut health](https://www.scmp.com/better-life/well-being/article/3027986/5-gut-friendly-foods-keep-your-digestive-system-healthy-and?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) One cup of your basic supermarket cold-fighting tea blend per day isn't really going to do much to help your immune system flush out any offending bacteria, especially once you're already showing symptoms. If you want to get the benefits from a tea, you have to steep it longer and/or use more herbal material (read: two or three tea bags per cup, or load everything up in a French press and let it really brew for 30 or more minutes). The same goes for tinctures - when suffering an acute condition, you need to be ingesting a full dropper (or whatever the guideline on the tincture bottle says) every few hours or so. When in doubt about dosage (or even whether or not a certain herb will work with your body), consult a trained clinical herbalist, holistic physician, naturopath, or other trusted source regarding natural medicine. And always see your healthcare provider or a pharmacist if you're planning to mix plant medicine with prescription medication. Above all, tune in to your body before, during, and after any seasonal illnesses, says Corbett. The best medicine for illness is prevention. While healthy looks different for everyone, there are solid steps you can prioritise this time of year to fight off winter nasties from taking root. You know the drill: sleep, fresh foods when possible, exercise and/or spending time outside, and staying hydrated. And if the cold does creep in, you've got plenty of plant allies to help you out. \"No herb is a replacement for a healthy lifestyle,\" says Corbett. \"It can help, but it won't fix you. Your body has a vital intelligence that is equipped to send you messages about what it needs. Listen to it.\" This article was curated by [ Young Post](https://yp.scmp.com).
