Using the complementarity of iron and Vitamin C as an example, this paper demonstrates that we can recover bioavailable nutrients to ensure recovery is efficient. Authors Jonathan Deutsch, PhD, professor in the Department of Food and Hospitality Management, Thomas O'Donnell, PhD, Department of Engagements for the Common Good, Cabrini University, and Solomon Katz, PhD, Emeritus, Department of Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania, show by example that returning food loss and waste into a healthy food environment can meet the daily and monthly needs of iron-deficiency in substantial portions of the populations with significant need and in all countries. Further, maximizing the availability of key nutrients, like iron, will reduce the stress of animal husbandry on the environment, reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and thereby, reduce agriculture impacts to climate change and global warming. Considering the quality, quantity, and convenience of food recovery, from farm\u2014and beyond fork\u2014to gut, is key for global policy development in nutrition public health and actions that are ready to implement today.
