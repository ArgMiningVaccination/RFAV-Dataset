Traditional perspectives on child and family health. Paediatr Child Health 2005;10(9):542-544. First Nations and American Indian communities experience signifi- cant health disparities compared with the general populations ofCanada and the United States. Children from these communitiesexperience higher rates of infant mortality, suicide and unintentionalinjury. From a traditional Lakota perspective, many of the health dis-parities faced in Aboriginal communities are linked to imbalances inthe family and community. These imbalances can lead to detrimentalbehaviours, including substance abuse, alcoholism and domestic vio-lence. The Medicine Wheel is a traditional symbol that can be used toattain a better understanding of these imbalances and how they relateto family and child health. However, significant differences existbetween the perspectives of modern medical science and traditionalcultures. To promote wellness and to prevent morbidity and mortalityin a culturally appropriate way, current efforts need to focus attentionon traditional cultural values and perspectives that incorporate the bal-ance of the community and the health of the family. Traditionally, weunderstood that the health of the family and community has a signifi-cant impact on the health of children. To more effectively promotehealth and to prevent imbalance, children from these communitiesneed to understand traditional values and to feel that they are animportant link between traditional culture and future generations.

And when t hat child com es into the home, the family must welcome it. And if the child is happy and feels the want, he will come into this world very, very strong. Andnot to know this is to know nothing.\" -Blackfeet I was privileged to grow up in a family with many traditional leaders, healers and medicine men. My traditional name isPejuta Wicasa, which means \"Medicine Man\" in the Lakotalanguage. I was named after my grandfather on my mother's sidein a traditional ceremony on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservationin Kyle, South Dakota, USA. I have several uncles who arepracticing traditional healers, and I was fortunate to learn tra-ditional philosophy from them starting at an early age. When Iwas considering going to medical school to receive formal med-ical education, my family was very supportive because theyknew that the only way we can successfully integrate traditionalphilosophy into modern medicine is if more of our own peoplebecome educated in modern medical science. I was told by thetraditional members of my family to go to their best schools andto learn and understand their form of medicine. The differences between modern allopathic and traditional Lakota approaches to medicine and health are significant.Much of the distinction can be described by understanding theterm allopathic. 'Allopathic' comes from two Greek words,allos and pathos. Allos means opposite or other, and pathos is disease or suffering (eg, pathology is the study of disease).Therefore, in allopathic medicine, our goal is to produce theopposite effect of the disease or symptom that we are treating.This is why so many classes of medications are 'anti' some-thing. For example, antibiotics, antihypertensives, antidepres-sants and anti-inflammatories are commonly used treatments inallopathic medicine. Conversely, traditional Lakota medicineuses a holistic approach in which health is seen as a balanceamong spiritual, mental, physical and emotional forces. Modern medicine focuses primarily on treating diseases, and traditional medicine focuses on promoting balance andhealth. It is ironic that we call ourselves 'health care providers'in modern medicine because the majority of our efforts arefocused on treating disease. In reality, we are disease careproviders in modern medicine. Contrarily, treating disease isone component of a larger picture of health promotion in tra-ditional medicine. The narrow focus of allopathic medicine isnot adequate in terms of addressing the holistic nature of how disease processes are experienced by individuals. Some of theprimary differences between modern and traditional medicineare summarized in Table 1. From a traditional perspective, the health of the community and the family determines the health of the individual.ORIGINAL ARTICLEWarne.qxd 11/2/2005 3:49 PM Page 542Unfortunately, in modern times, American Indian and First Nations communities suffer from significant health disparitieswhen compared with the general population. Unhealthy com-munities produce unhealthy families, and our children sufferfrom high rates of preventable diseases as a result. For example,in both Canada (1) and the United States (2), AmericanIndians and First Nations people have shorter life expectanciesthan do the general population, and infant mortality anddeaths caused by unintentional injuries or suicide are signifi-cantly higher than in the general population. Recent studies have identified numerous potential causes of health disparities, including genetics, access to health services,poverty (3), income distribution (4) and discrimination (5).However, from a traditional Lakota perspective, much of theadversity that our communities face is rooted in the loss ofland, traditional culture and lifestyle. As stated by my uncleRick T wo Dogs, \"We need to understand that the primary rea-son our people are so afflicted with addiction, poverty, abuse and strife, is that our way of life was taken from us. Everythingwas taken. And nothing was replaced\" (6). Traditionally, our people lived in balance as individuals, fam- ilies and communities. The Medicine Wheel is a useful symbolto promote understanding of traditional balance. In Figure 1, theMedicine Wheel represents an individual, and to be healthy, theindividual must live in balance among spiritual (east), mental(north), physical (west) and emotional (south) forces. From a traditional perspective, the loss of ancestral home- lands, culture, language and other components of traditi onal life has led to a deeply rooted loss of identity as Native people. This sense of loss can be seen as a spiritually and emotionallybased imbalance that has resulted in self-destructive behav- iours, including alcoholism, substance abuse, domestic violenceand suicide. Another way to envision the Medicine Wheel is toexamine traditional systems of values, decisions, actions andreactions (Figure 2). From a spiritual perspective, we interpret our values into decisions in the mental realm. We implement our decisionsinto actions in the physical realm, and our actions producereactions in the emotional realm. These reactions and emo-tions provide feedback and input into the value system, allow-ing for reevaluation of our decisions and actions (behaviours).This system of understanding allows for continuous reevalua-tion and self-discovery. However, the history of child abuse inboarding schools, and the loss of land and culture has also ledto a loss of traditional values. When the traditional value sys-tem is excluded from the circle, self-destructive behaviours,such as alcohol abuse, can occur (Figure 3). Unfortunately, one of the manifestations of imbalance and substance abuse in the home is domestic violence. This hashad a significantly detrimental impact on the physical, emo-tional and spiritual health of our children. T raditionally, Native men were the protectors of the family and community. The spiritual illness brought about from loss of culture, lan-guage and land has led to recent generations of men abusingwomen, and adults abusing or neglecting children. From a tra-ditional perspective, and by using Medicine Wheel symbolism,it can be seen how treating and preventing alcohol abuse andother self-destructive and family-destructive behavioursrequires a spiritual healing process and a return to traditionalvalues.

One of the initial steps in this process of spiritual healing is to understand traditional values and to identify the basis fordecision- making. In Lakota philosophy, there are seven tradi- tional values that correspond to the seven directions - east,north, west, south, up, down and within. The traditionalvalues are fortitude (east/spiritual), wisdom (north/mental),courage (west/physical), respect (down/mother earth) and humility(centre /within) (T able 2). The Medicine Wheel can also represent traditional values when considered in three dimensions (Figure 4). Fortitude can be seen as the inner strength or inner fire that allows an individual to persevere in the face of adversity.Wisdom is the ability to make the right decisions, not just forself, but for family and community. Courage is the willingnessto put oneself in harm's way to protect family and community or to advance a higher cause or purpose. Generosity is the givingof possessions, time and energy to others so that they may pros- per. Honour is having integrity and honest character - beingone who can be trusted. Respect is understanding the impor-tance of all creation, including people, animals and earth.Humility is the core value - understanding that the values andgifts given to us by our creator are not meant only for personalgain. Our purpose is to protect, heal and advance our commu-nities for the benefit of future generations. Using these valuesas a basis for decision-making can make the way in which welive our lives balanced and meaningful, and it is a beautiful wayto teach our children to behave and to interact with the worldaround them. The best method to teach theses values is byexample. In this way, it can be seen how healing our commu-nities and families in terms of promoting traditional values isan important component of promoting health in our childrenand in future generations. In the traditional Lakota way, we are taught to pray for the next seven generations to come. Personally, I feel a great dealof strength in knowing that my ancestors from the previousseven generations prayed for my well-being. This gives me for-titude and courage, and it strengthens all the traditional values.It also helps me to feel a strong sense of connection to futureand previous generations, and that I am a vital link in a chainof generations in my family.Our youth need to feel that they are an important link in the chain of their families and communities. Considering thatmost of the morbidity and mortality in First Nations youth ispreventable (eg, injuries and suicide), it is imperative to iden-tify the most effective means to promote health and preventinjury, illness and death. It is clear that the health of the com-munity and the health of the family have a significant impacton the health of the children. Therefore, a focus on childhealth also needs to include promotion of health in the familyand in the community. Perhaps the first and most importantstep toward reducing health disparities is to identify and strengthen local cultural belief systems. The traditional ways ofthe Lakota and other tribes provide a culturally appropriate, holistic and meaningful way to promote community health. Asstated by Joseph M Marshall III in his book The Lakota Way: Stories and Lessons for Living (7): \"A cornerstone of Lakota culture can be summed up in the words family and kinship. Family is the backbone, the foun- dation of our culture. We are given substance, nurtured, andsustained by family. Kinship goes beyond family and is the connection we feel to the world at large and everything in it.\" REFERENCES 1. Health Canada, First Nations and Inuit Health Branch.
