This concept fi rst arose on the policy agenda of the World Health Organisation in the 1970s and then re-emerged in 2002 (wit h alternative and complementary medicines). The history of this policy at the gl obal level and its transfer to national levels over this period is analysed, via the content, scope and outcomes of policy and programme documents. This analysis emphasises the roles of context and stakeholders (specifically interest groups). The context in terms of the economic, political and social environme nt surrounding the development of the policy is considered, and held to offer a potent ial explanation as to how and why the policy agenda on integration was set and the manner in which p rogrammes were formulated and implemented. Interest group interaction (compe tition for resources) is concluded to play a key role in explaining the development of this policy on an international level, and its problematic transfer to national levels. A case st udy of Sri Lanka explores national level implementation in greater detail. An analytical framework to analyse the development and impleme ntation of this policy has been created, from a synthesis of anthropological and political s cience tools. The combination of several theories into an analytical framework allows this poli cy issue to be understood as an intrinsically political exercise that has been stimula ted by global social and economic forces. The analytical framework developed offers another tool fo r the analysis and consequent understanding of the health policy process and thus may h ave relevance beyond the health policy issue of integration. 1 1. Introduction 1.1 Introduction At the turn of the century, the impacts of globalisation1 on the development of health policy and provision of health services became a focus for researchers in the health field (Buse et al., 2002; Manderson, 2000). new focus was the result of a growi ng realisation that globalisation was exerting complex impacts on public health, and heal th policy formulation and implementation. Researchers began questioning the extent th at globalisation itself was a contributing factor to the worsening of global public health and the fai lure of global health initiatives. The regressive impacts of globalisation on public healt h were most obvious in developing nations (the South) where there has been a \u0093slow, unstable and unequal pattern of growth, and stagnation in health indicators\u0094 (Cornia, 2001:79). Worsening global public health was despite \u0093one of the most extraordin ary attempts to frame a global health agenda\u0094 in the 1970s, the commitment by member stat es of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to achieving \u0093Health For All\u0094 (HFA) by the turn of the century (Kickbusch, 2002). The HFA goal (1978) was a bold, landmark initiative, spurred by the recognition that biomedical health care systems were not adequatel y meeting the needs of populations in the South (Djukanovic & Mach, 1975), and influenced by the o ptimistic movement for a more holistic approach to development of that time (Mac donald, 1992). A new approach using local resources and knowledge was advocated. Under the W HO- endorsed policies, integration (formalisation) of traditional medicine (TRM) into health c are systems was required in order to achieve optimal health car e coverage (Stepan, 1983:307). However, implementation of this objective on national levels was h indered by a variety of factors, some of which were associated with globalisation . Despite consensus at the international level in the 1970s that such an approach was rational, pr actical, and offered social and economic benefits (WHO, 1978b), it proved difficult to reali se over the following decades. 1 Globalisation is defined as \u0093 the intensification of worldwide social relations which link distant l ocalities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occur ring many miles away and vice versa\u0094 (Giddens in Albr echt et al. 2000:84). 2 As the policy for formalising the role of TRM in national health car e systems seemed to lose momentum in the South in the 1980s, new trends emerged in developed co untries (the North). Millions of people began seeking complementary/alter native (CAM) approaches to biomedical systems. TRM systems became subject to intense clinic al and commercial interest. As will be argued later, this presented new threat s and challenges to the integrity of TRM and its role in health care in the South. Although the profile of TRM had been raised, the lack of progress in policy formulation and implementation left it vulnerable to economic exploitation. In 2002, the WHO announced a global TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e). The TRM Strategy called for all member states to integrate and formalise the rol e of TRM/CAM in health care systems. In the 25 years since the WHO originally promoted the rol e of TRM, only 25 out of the 191 member states had developed an associated policy (WHO, 2002e:3). A s this thesis will demonstrate, over that time demographic changes, growing medi cal pluralism and changing economic and social trends created a policy \u0093convergence\u0094 in both the North and South. The applicability of TRM/CAM in health care had broadened and f orced a range of policy issues onto the global agenda. The WHO TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) can therefore be seen as an example of one of the trends in a globalising world \u0096 convergence , where a common policy solution is proposed for global application.2 There has been an increasing emphasis on global models, w here policies from one part of the world are transplanted elsewhere without du e regard to context or objectives. Therefore, the global\u0096local interface in ter ms of policy transfer, (Buse et al., 2002:271), the processes of policy transfer, and the role of internat ional organisations in that process (Ogden, Walt, & Lush, 2003) are deemed worthy of further attenti on. Exploring such questions requires comparative country case studie s to establish the impact of policies and the roles of actors in making policy \u0093coherent and fea sible\u0094 (Buse et al., 2002:272). One important consideration that McPake notes is the variat ion of objectives that may exist in different settings despite common policy prescrip tions (2002). Buse et al. caution against the widespread transfer and adoption of universal p olicy models that may be \u0093conceived from predetermined ideological preferences and introd uced through top-down 2 Some health policy theorists have argued that ther e are global patterns emerging regarding the reform of health systems (see Field, 1989; Alridge & Sundarapandiyan, 1995). This concept has usually been applied to financial/economic factors, such as the application of market mechanisms (McPake, 2002). However, as fa r as the convergence theory argues that common policy solution s are emerging, it is applicable to the concept of integration of TRM/CAM. The reasons for convergence are still a matter of conjecture (Buse et al., 2002; McPake, 200 2). 3approaches\u0094 as this process usually precedes an adequate evaluat ion of whether such policies work, and under what conditions (2002:267). 1.2 Health policy Considine (1994) determines that policy can be any or all of: clarification of public values and intentions; commitments of money and services; or the granting of r ights and entitlements. He concludes that the standard definition is \u0093a public policy is an action which employs governmental authority to commit resources in support of a preferred value\u0094 (1994:3). Therefore WHO policy statements and resolutions (while not committing government resources directly) can be analysed through the preferr ed values they support and their internal resource allocation. Researchers and academics in the health policy and governance fi eld have questioned the \u0093rationality\u0094 of health policy formulation and implementat ion. Kickbusch asks \u0093why in the course of globalisation, the primacy of economics overran all knowledge of what constitutes sound health policy?\u0094 She points out the paradox that, despite all the information available on determinants on health and means to address this, health policy i s often very different than one would expect based on such information (Kickbusch, 2002). Som e commentators think health policy should be rational because of this very fact \u0096 th at the information on the problem and the solution is available, so implementation should t herefore be straightforward. Policy is generally assumed rational when the problem is technica l, the climate consensual and the process controlled (Gordon, Lewis, & Young, 1993:7). However, as many commentators conclude and this thesis will demon strate, health policy is far from \u0093rational\u0094. The notion of \u0093rationality\u0094 in health policy i s a very subjective and ambiguous concept that varies depending upon perspective \u0096 for exam ple, economic, political or socially \u0093rational\u0094 outcomes may vary widely. Acc epting any premise of rationality where experts (such as economists or epidemiologists) m ake a logical plan which is then simply implemented will lead to very flawed assumption s (Zwi & Mills, 1995:315). As health policy is shaped by power relations (is inherently poli tical) irrational outcomes and conflict in formulation and implementation will inevitably occur. A coherent and feasible policy needs to take into account the motivations and likely respons es of various actors as well as constraints and contexts at national levels, and this thesis w ill explore those key factors. 4Health is usually considered different from other policy fields no t only because it is a public good, but also because the biomedical profession has a complicated role in shaping and constraining it; the inherent complexity of health care provis ion (such as balancing ethical, moral and social justice considerations with economic concerns ); and the assumed inability of consumers to distinguish between quality of services and weigh up c osts and benefits (Hancock, 1999; Palmer & Short, 2000:24). In making health policy, political and economic issues are therefore central, and the interests of the actors and stakeholders involved are an important factor (Walt, 1994). Berliner and Salmon (1980a:547) reflec t this view when they note that the conflict between TRM/CAM and biomedicine in health paradigms and health policy is political \u0096 it is about power and control. Therefore formulation and implementation of health policy wil l be very difficult, as it will result in a bargained outcome, the process will be impeded by \u0093div ersity and constraint\u0094 and the environment is one of conflict (Gordon, Lewis, & Young, 1993:8). If it is acknowledged that health policy formulation and implementation is political and the relationship between medical systems is also essentially political, understanding the motivation and behaviour of actors involved is crucial in order to understand the outcomes and im pact of a proposed policy. If this behavioural aspect is overlooked, it will be difficul t to understand and anticipate responses. Assuming that individuals, groups, or organi sations behave rationally is an oversimplification (Jenkins, 1993:42), and this is compounded by an amb iguous and uncertain environment for implementation. The relationship and interaction between medical systems has a long and complicated history. Integration of TRM into formal health care systems i s a complex issue that touches on a range of significant topics. Many of these issues are within dis crete disciplines accompanied by bodies of extensive literature, traversing fields as diverse as anthropology, sociology, health sciences, psychology, philosophy, law, economics, na tural sciences and history. The scope of this research does not allow the explorati on of this literature (and other related issues) in depth. Instead, this analysis aims to use a mul ti-disciplinary approach to illuminate global and local policy formulation and implementatio n in relation to integration of TRM in the latter part of the century. This scrutinises TRM and its role in health care systems fro m a political science perspective, and could be located within the discipline of critical medical anthropology (see Morsy, 1990; Singer, 1986; 1989, 1990; Singer, Baer, & Lazarus, 1990). It places the concept of integration within its political, economic and social context in expl oring why it emerged on the policy agenda in the 1970s, its global-local transfer in the interv ening years and the 5circumstances surrounding its re-emergence on the internation al agenda as a global WHO Strategy in 2002 (WHO, 2002e). 1.3 History and context As the focus of this research is on the interaction of various medica l systems, it is important to offer some background information on their history. Different s ystems of medicine and health care trace their roots to prehistoric sources of knowledge abo ut the human body and its interaction with the environment. Over time, different schools of t hought on health care have waxed and waned. Each sought to perfect methods to obtain well bei ng, and defeat disease and death. Long before writing was invented, this revered knowledge w as passed down from generation to generation; changing and developing as the social, economic, c ultural and physical environment transformed over centuries. Arabic, Chinese, Egyptian, Indian, and Western civilisations all produced complex systems of healthcar e, using different tools and concepts, and interacting with each other in various ways. There have bee n tens of thousands of different medical traditions practiced on Earth (Grossinger, 1990:47), some of which still survive and others which have been born or reborn in this generati on. With globalisation over the past century, the manner in which vari ous systems of health care have developed and interacted within the modern state has become increasingly multifaceted. Focussing only on the recent past of the last few decade s, changes in both health systems and the health status of populations has been profound an d rapid. \u0093Globalisation\u0094 is not a new phenomenon, although it has increased in velo city during the course of the twentieth century and changed in nature (Chen & Berling uer, 2001; Zielinski Gutierrez & Kendall, 2000). Whiteford and Manderson call it \u0093merely an o ld book in a new cover\u0094 with the same purposes and outcomes as imperialism and colonia lism (2000:3). They contend that globalisation facilitates and extends processes that c ommenced with colonisation, where \u0093knowledge\u0094 and \u0093authority\u0094 were exported and imposed on local behaviours, values and beliefs (2000:13). This process is clearly evident in the provision of health care servic es, where Western biomedical models were transferred and entrenched worldwide. S ome consider biomedicine to be \u0093one of the best examples of globalisation\u0094 (van der Geest, Reynolds Whyte, & Hardon, 1996:155). The relationship between imported biomedical and existing i ndigenous or traditional systems of healing offers an interesting exam ple of health systems development that has absorbed anthropologists and social scien tists for decades. 61.3.1 Definitions and use of terms All of the definitions and terms used for both biomedicine and TRM/CAM are plagued with controversy and difficulties. None of the terms (traditional, comple mentary, alternative, biomedical) are adequate and all are contested (for example, see Cassidy, 2002; Eskinazi icult to define because of the diverse range of practices it encompasses. In addition , efforts to define TRM usually reflect particular values and cultural norms (Millet, 1999; Ra njan, 1998:52; Wolffers, 1990:5). Janes concludes that \u0093there is no satisfactory term to refer to no n-Western, indigenous medical systems\u0094 (1999:1803) and the WHO acknowledged that \u0093at a gl obal level, traditional medicine eludes precise definition or descript ion\u0094 (WHO, 2002e:7). The WHO has defined TRM as \u0093ways to protect and restore health that e xisted before the arrival of modern medicine\u0094 (WHO, 1996b). However, WHO also notes that this distinction is arbitrary in that \u0093all medicine is modern in so far as it is satisfactorily directed towards the common goal of providing health care, despite the setting in time, place a nd culture\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:9). The term traditional medicine includes \u0093 diverse health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal, and/or mineral bas ed medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises applied singularly or i n combination to maintain wellbeing, as well as to treat, diagnose or prevent illness\u0094 (WH O, 2002e:7). Traditional medicine (TRM) and \u0093complementary\u0094 or \u0093altern ative\u0094 medicines (CAM) share many similarities, and variations in terms mainly reflect h istorical, political, cultural, and geographic distinctions. Complementary and alternative medicines can be considered any therapeutic system based on a theory of health/disease or method of tr eatment other than that of biomedicine. As such, TRM can be considered a form of CAM, and the term CAM is used in those countries with no history of TRM (WHO, 2002e:1, 8). TRM is the term used in the South, and CAM in the North, referring generally to those systems of medicine and health that use natural remedies, spiritual and/or physical therapies . This distinction is used throughout this document, with TRM/CAM used when referring to thes e systems of health care in the global sense. Biomedicine is defined as the system of medicine which is of western origin and ba sed on the biological sciences (Janes, 1999:1803). Biomedicine is based on principl es and values of western scientific knowledge and is also known as western, conventional , modern, orthodox, mainstream, cosmopolitan, scientific or allopathic medicin e. All of the labels are \u0093culturally loaded, inaccurate and no longer appropriate\u0094 (Cassidy, 2002:401), and wo rds such as 7\u0093doctor\u0094 and \u0093medicine\u0094 have become exclusively associated w ith biomedicine when they are general and neutral terms that can refer to a variety of medicin e or a variety of doctors (Cassidy, 2002:401). Aspects of these terms and definitions are contentious. For exam ple, the term biomedicine implies a degree of scientific objectivity that is not corr ect (Janes, 1999:1803). Van der Geest considers the term TRM \u0093misleading, embarrassing, and na \u00efve\u0094 as it suggests homogeneity, is ethnocentric and disregards the fact that biomedici ne is also traditional in the sense of being handed down over generations (1997:904). Wolffers highlight s biomedical bias in some definitions of TRM (1990:5). Bodeker prefers the term \u0093traditional systems of health care\u0094 as they provide \u0093comprehensive app roaches to prevention and treatment beyond the scope of medicine alone\u0094 (1994b:6). Others have noted the tensions in defining \u0093traditional\u0094 or differen t systems of medicine as other to the dominant biomedical discourse, which is implicitly consi dered the standard or norm \u0096 particularly evident in the term \u0093alternative\u0094 (Ranjan, 1998:52). Koop (2002) and Easthope (2003) note that changes in the use of the terms \u0093alternative\u0094 and \u0093complementary\u0094 reflects shifts in usage trends. Initially, \u0093alternative me dicine\u0094 was the term used, reflecting disenchantment with biomedicine \u0093as well as a cultural rebellion against the biomedical community\u0094 (Koop, 2002). More recently, \u0093alternative\u0094 therapies h ave become more frequently referred to as \u0093complementary\u0094 therapies, used no t in opposition to biomedicine but as an adjunct to it. Saks (1992a) argues that the term \u0093alternative medicine\u0094 is pref erable to terms such as \u0093complementary\u0094, \u0093traditional\u0094 or \u0093holistic\u0094 as this express ion is more comprehensive. For example, \u0093traditional medicine\u0094 does not encompass some of the m ore recently developed therapies such as chiropractic. The term \u0093complementary me dicine\u0094 excludes therapies with philosophies that fundamentally conflict with biomedical theor y (such as homeopathy) (Saks, 1992a:3). Finally, \u0093holistic medicine\u0094 does not include the rapies based on mechanistic systems of disorders such as osteopathy. According to Saks, using the concept of \u0093alternative medicine\u0094 is not only more widely applicable but has \u0093greater analytical utility\u0094 than other labels. O ther terms are based on trying to identify common elements in an inherently heterogenous fie ld. As Saks proposes that the main distinguishing feature of such therapies is their weaker socio-political position in the health care system (1992a:3), the term \u0093alternative\u0094 encompa sses the notion of their role outside formal health care systems. Despite that, most of these systems are \u0093holistic\u0094 in 8the sense of promoting health and preventing illness, in contrast to t he biomedical mechanistic/engineering concept of intervention (Saks, 1992a:4 ). It could be argued, however, that the term \u0093alternative medicine\u0094 is ethnocentric an d fails to adequately take into account cultural contexts where biomedicine was not histor ically the main medical system. The term \u0093traditional medicine\u0094 is sometimes used in the North to r efer to biomedical (conventional) systems (Benjamin et al., 1997; Rifaat, 1997). This is a reflection of the cultural relativity of the terms, where biomedical systems are co nsidered the norm and thus the \u0093traditional\u0094 system. The relativity of all terms is import ant to note. The definitions are not static across time or culture, and such terms are largely po litical (Astin et al., 1998:2309). Saks points out that \u0093much of the alternative medicine has links with mainstream health practices of centuries past and may well be on course to become part of the new orthodoxy of the future\u0094 (1992a:4). Despite inadequacies and difficulties in definition, the term TRM is used in this thesis for consistency. Although \u0093traditional systems of health care\u0094 may be a more representative term, the use of TRM is consistent with WHO documents. When the generic term is insufficient for the discussion, more specific descriptions of par ticular healing traditions will be used. Although TRM encompasses diverse practices, to enable a nalysis of this issue on a global level, it is considered as representative of one group with phil osophies that differ from and oppose biomedicine. Therefore, TRM/CAM systems and practitioners worldwide ar e grouped together as a cohesive interest group, even though they do not operate in this fas hion or necessarily identify with each other. This is based on Saks\u0092 concept that \u0093t he key distinguishing feature of such therapies is not their common content, but their socio-pol itically defined marginal standing in the health care system\u0094 (Saks, 1992a:3). Despite not shar ing common content, these health care systems share broadly similar features \u0096 for exa mple: the use of biological resources such as plants, physical therapies and specialised rit ual/spiritual techniques.3 While some may find the groupings of biomedicine and TRM/CAM crude or mi sleading, others would similarly reject the dichotomies of North and South . Just as the heterogenous 3 It is acknowledged that this is a crude grouping, akin to \u0093the lumping of human races into two categori es: \u0091caucasian\u0092 and \u0091other\u0092\u0094 (Press, 1980:45). However, without such a generalisation, global (cross-cultur al) analysis would not be possible. Some CAM practitioners would be surprised to be grouped with TRM, as they percei ve inherent distinctions based on geography, history an d philosophy rather than similarities based on socio -political position and health care resources used. 9nature of the professional groupings has been acknowledged, it must also be acknowledged that the categories of North and South contain a large number of coun tries which differ widely. The North-South distinction could even be applied withi n countries, as wealth is stratified and polarised to varying degrees on national as well as gl obal levels. The categories of \u0093developed\u0094 and \u0093developing\u0094 is being replaced w ith other categories and the terms North to indicate developed, industrialised countries and South to indicate countries dependent upon development aid has been adopted by some (Kick busch & Buse, 2001:703). These categories are not an effort to simplify by disregar ding disparities; they are used only as abstractions. This permits macro-analysis, in orde r to consider larger scale processes and entities (government agencies, internationa l bodies, professional groups, economic and environmental forces) and address questions of power , resource allocation and organisation (Janzen, 1978:121). Finally, the term integration can have multiple meanings, and is difficult to define and describe (Adams, 2003). Firstly, it can refer to incorporation o f TRM/CAM into the general or formal health care system. Secondly, the use of some TRM/CAM by biome dical doctors, or the practice of traditional or alternative medicines alongside b iomedicine can also be a form of integration. Thirdly, it can refer to the synthesis of TRM and b iomedicine into a new branch of medical science which incorporates elements of both (WHO, 2000d:16-17). In this thesis, integration is used to refer to incorporating TRM/CAM into the formal health c are system. This can take different forms and is discussed further in the following section. 1.3.2 Structure and organisation of health care systems The use of universal policy prescriptions regardless of context h as a long tradition in relation to the organisation of formal health care systems. Commencing in the nineteenth century, the Western biomedical model was transferred globally with litt le effort to match services to local needs (Macdonald, 1992:17). While Unschuld notes that the cross- cultural transfer of medical resources has an extensive history,4 colonialism actively suppressed and rejected existing indigenous medical traditions on the assumption that medical re sources imported from the West were sufficient to construct a complete health car e delivery system (Unschuld, 1976b:5). This also served particular political and economic interes ts (Brown, 1978, 1979; 4 Approximately 25% of modern medicines are derived fro m plants first used traditionally (WHO, 2002b). Some of these include resperine (from Rauvolfia ) which is used to treat blood-pressure and central nervous system disorders; quinine (from 1995). Macdonald (1992) and Doyal (1979) provide comprehensive overviews of the history and parameters of the biomedical philosoph ical base, and the consequences of its ascendancy in the South. The idea of transferring biomedical systems was related to the \u0093moder nisation\u0094 theory of social development, which assumed that as developing societies ado pted western ideology, \u0093indigenous healing would wither on the vine\u0094 and biomedicine would prove a s uperior substitution (Kleinman, 1984:139). It was then that the label \u0093traditiona l medicine\u0094 was applied, to signify them as separate and distinct \u0096 an aspect of the tradi tion and history that biomedicine was to replace in its modernising mission. Before bi omedicine arrived, there weren\u0092t any \u0093traditional\u0094 medicines, there was just medicine/ health care. Though generally presented otherwise, biomedicine is itself only Western indigenous medi cine in a new location, where it was the \u0093alternative\u0094 medicine. On util isation figures in the South, it remains the \u0093alternative\u0094 system today (Bodeker, 1996:323). The belief about modernisation and its inevitable replacement of existing health traditions was therefore proven false, as the use of TRM continued to flourish an d sole reliance on biomedical infrastructure was found to be untenable (Djukanovic & Mach , 1975; Kavadi, 1991; demand for TRM decreasing with modernisat ion, some have contended that it actually increased \u0096 TRM practitione rs can offer a therapeutic social relationship that may help people cope with rapid social and ec onomic transformations, or the transition to urban life (\u0093maladies of modernisation\u0094) (DeJong, 1991:6; Good et al., 1979:146; Green, 1988:1128). The paradox of increasing demand for TRM with urbanis ation has also been linked to affordability, efforts to preserve local heritage or a lack of independent access to plant sources for self-medication (Bodeker & Bich an, 1996:390). In some countries TRM knowledge systems were embraced and promoted d uring the post- colonial period, as part of the restoration of national customs (Is lam, 1994). The movement to utilise and recognise the value of TRM in national health care sys tems thus had a dual purpose. It was motivated by the need to provide basic health care serv ices, and it was reinforced by the political aspiration of reviving the heritage of newly indep endent nations (George, 1991; Okoth-Owiro, 1994:39-40; Stepan, 1983:298). This was endorsed on the international level by the WHO in the 1970s, with an acknowledgment that TR M systems offered a feasible alternative in establishing and extending heal th care services. This was \u0093revolutionary\u0094 for an organisation that until that point had stro ngly advocated and assisted 11in the transfer of Western biomedical technology as the only appropri ate method to deliver health care services (Lee, 1997; Turshen, 1993:987), in line with the UN objective of modernisation. However, organising TRM in legal and policy frameworks presented a ra nge of conceptual and structural difficulties (Green, 1988; Neumann & Lauro, 1982; Pil lsbury, 1982). Biomedical systems continued to dominate formal health care deli very worldwide, which Unschuld argued was \u0093more due to coercive factors than to natural develop ment and demands from the population\u0094 (Unschuld, 1975:303). Support for biomedicine from dominant global paradigms was augmented by its \u0093nearly perfect\u0094 a daptation to bureaucratic organisation, which inflated its role in health care planning (L eslie, 1983:314). For example, biomedicine continued to absorb up to 90% of resourc es invested by international agencies, while reaching only around 10% of populations ( Bodeker, 2001a:390). Biomedical tertiary services were allocated the majorit y of resources, with little fiscal appropriation for primary health care (Zwi & Mills, 1995:309), and biomedical specialists/hospitals captured both the health budget and prestige in s ervice delivery (Light, 1995:33). The domination of formal health care systems by biomedicine resu lts in a dependency on pharmaceuticals and technology \u0096 the former often absorbing up to 30-50% of health care costs in the South (Chi, 1994:308). Stepan (1983) described four main organisational relationships betw een biomedical and TRM systems in national health care (see table 1), a schema which h as been used, with some variations, by others (Bannerman, Burton, & Wen-Chieh, 1983; Bodeker, 2001b; Last, 1990; Young, 1994). It should be noted that as the exclusive and tolerant systems either suppress or ignore TRM, the methods for actively using TRM in national health ca re systems are therefore the integrated and inclusive systems (Leslie, 1983:317). The use of these categories, the countries grouped within them, and their practical meaning is not a matter on which there is universal consensus. Leslie consi ders it important to understand that these labels actually describe normative institutio ns and not the reality of how health systems operate. Integrated systems do not incorpora te all aspects of TRM, only selected practices. Inclusive (parallel) systems may have sepa rate institutions for biomedical and TRM education and delivery, but integration may occur at the consum er (or even practitioner) level. These systems form a \u0093continuum\u0094 rather tha n two distinct frameworks (1983:316). 12Table 1: Organisation of health care systems Type Definition Example (1983) Monopolistic (exclusive) Only the practice of biomedicine is recognised as lawful Most European countries and their colonies \u0096 19th and first half of the 20th century Tolerant Does not officially recognise TRM, but does not prevent the practice of non-biomedical systems Germany, United Kingdom, Australia Inclusive (parallel) Two (or possibly more) systems of health and medical care co-exist (separate formal recognition) Sri Lanka, India Integrated (integrative) Biomedical and TRM are merged in medical education and service delivery - jointly practiced China Source: Adapted from Stepan (1983); Bodeker (1994b:7); WHO (2002) According to the WHO, monopolistic systems no longer operated by 2002 and only three relationships between medical systems were recognised in the TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e:8-9): integrative systems, where TRM/CAM is officially incorporated into heal th care provision, including drug policy, regulation and registration of p ractitioners and products, public and private provision of therapies, health insur ance, and education inclusive systems recognise TRM/CAM but it is not fully integrated into al l aspects of formal health care, whether at the delivery, education and trai ning, or regulation levels tolerant models where the health care system is based entirely on biomedicine, but some TRM/CAM practices are tolerated. The lack of recognition of monopolistic systems in the TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) reflects a shift that developed throughout the twentieth century. Most count ries operating under monopolistic systems gradually moved to tolerant models (for exampl e, many countries in Africa), and those with tolerant models moved towards the inclus ive/parallel systems (for example, Germany and the United Kingdom were classified as toler ant in 1983 but inclusive in 2002). However, this trend has been further extrapolated by the WHO as indicating that monopolistic systems have ceased to exist and that \u0093ultimat ely countries operating an inclusive [parallel] system can be expected to attain an integ rative system\u0094 (WHO, 2002e:9). However, as this thesis demonstrates, the development of an integra tive system is not necessarily evolutionary as assumed by the WHO. The continuum of syst ems is not one that represents a progressive \u0093improvement\u0094 on a scale, with parallel systems on one end and 13integrative systems on the other. Rather, the position on this contin uum represents a political relationship between different medical systems, mediated thr ough the state. The state has a critical role in determining structural access to and distributi on of health services, and the regulatory basis for practice in the formal sector. Countries th at have achieved \u0093fully\u0094 integrated systems are rare, and have socialist or communist bac kgrounds (China, Vietnam, and Democratic Republic of Korea). They rejected neo-liberal ec onomic values, were shielded from global market forces and had a strongly espoused pol itical commitment to equity in the provision of social services. Further, where \u0093integration\u0094 has been achieved, it has been questioned whether this \u0093arranged marriage\u0094 is necessarily a \u0093happy marriage\u0094 (Beyer stein & Sampson, 1997).5 As all organisational relationships between medical systems in fo rmal health care networks are dominated by biomedicine, and integrated systems exclude many as pects of TRM (Leslie, 1983:316), there are inherent tensions and conflicts. Bodeker comments th at in China, biomedical control over the process of integration resulted in the lo ss of aspects of TRM theory and practice (Bodeker, 2001b). In South Korea, conflict between pr actitioners of different systems of medicine was high throughout the 1990s, in the le ad up to the goal of full integration by 2001 (Bodeker, 2001b; Cho, 2000b).6 In Japan, herbal medicine was \u0093in serious danger of a complete demise through its \u0091integration\u0092 an d adoption into biomedicine\u0094 (Lock, 1990:42). Young (1994:66) determines that, in this regard, monopolist ic and integrative systems share much in common, and van der Geest ( 1985) alludes to integration as a \u0093fatal embrace\u0094. The paradox of the policy of integration is that it has widesprea d support from a coalition of diverse interests, including governments, international bodies, ph armacologists, idealists, radicals and realists (Last, 1986:1), although genuine collaborati on at the practitioner level is rare. Functional national policies have proven very difficult to articu late and implement. This is a peculiar situation, considering the practical benefits that could be obtained, the statements of support from stakeholders, and the length of time that integration has been advocated. Asking why this collaboration is easy to agree on and difficult to achieve may be a simple question, but there is no simple answer. Looking in more det ail at key stakeholders provides some clues. 5 Unschuld concludes that very limited integration ha s taken place in China or anywhere else, and structu red competition was more often the outcome (1976b:19). 6 Ambivalence, discord and resistance has also been d ocumented in Nigeria (Offiong, 1999), South Africa (Kale, 1995), Zimbabwe (Freeman & Motsei, 1992), Uganda (T abuti, Dhillion, & Lye, 2003), Ethiopia (Bishaw, 19 91), Ghana (Warren et al., 1982) and Botswana (Barbee, 1 986) \u0096 amongst other countries. 141.4 Stakeholders Friction between stakeholders is a crucial issue in the formulation and implementation of a policy of integration. This friction is multi-faceted. For exam ple, on a global level there may be divergences of objectives between non-state bodies; health car e practitioners may have tensions related to securing economic and professional benefits; a nd national governments have to reconcile competing domestic demands while adopting inter nationally-driven agendas. Although improved access, outcomes, equity and quality in health care for consumers may be State goals, sectional interests and conflicting pr inciples often overshadow these objectives. A brief description of some of the main stakeholders (international bodies, the state, medical systems, and citizens) and their roles is discussed below. 1.4.1 International bodies Since its inception over 50 years ago, the WHO has been considered the principle body for guiding international health work and policy (Lucas, 2003). During the f irst 30 years of operation, it focused on mainly providing technical and scientific a dvice and setting international normative standards. However, in the late 1960s and d uring the 1970s, membership swelled with newly independent states, and decisions became \u0093more political and less predictable\u0094 (Godlee, 1994a). The Health For All initiati ve in the 1970s (of which use of TRM was an aspect) was one scheme that marked the beginning of a n advocacy role which some consider breached its mandate to provide technical advic e (Lee et al., 1996). This goal was \u0093extraordinarily ambitious\u0094 although \u0093in tune with t he times, espousing equality and social justice\u0094 (Godlee, 1994a). During the 1980s and 1990s, the WHO was subject to increasing criticism, which mounted as it became apparent the \u0093Health For All by the Year 2000\u0094 goal had fai led. A lack of funding, inability to implement policies, a narrow biomedical and t echnical focus, lack of co- ordination, and structural weaknesses combined to limit its effe ctiveness (Godlee, 1994a, 1994b, 1995b). At the same time, the World Bank began to take an active role in health matters, and by the 1990s was considered the \u0093new 800 lb gorilla in wor ld health care\u0094 (Abbasi, 1999a:866). While the WHO is primarily an advisory body, it also funds and promote s some programmes although its budget has progressively decreased since the 1980s (Ogden, Wa lt, & Lush, 152003). The World Bank offers loans, but these are often conditional and may be tied to policy prescriptions. It also has an increasing role in funding progra mmes directly and indirectly related to health since the 1980s (Abbasi, 1999a, 1999d). The World B ank quickly managed to eclipse the WHO in directing global health policy through the sheer volume of funding it provided.7 It also heavily influenced paradigms in global health policy, with the key 1993 World Development Report Investing in Health viewed as the epitome of applying economic rationalist principles to health care. However, despite taking an increasingly active role in global healt h, critics considered the World Bank\u0092s debt servicing requirements and structural adjustm ent programmes were acting as a powerful, negative counterforce to improving the health s tatus of populations in the South (Bello, 1994; Werner, 1995, 1998). In the 1990s the World Bank began to ta ke a direct interest in TRM from an economic and trade perspective rathe r than purely as a health issue, under the mandate of improving efficiency of health s ystems and guiding sustainable development (DeJong, 1991; 1997; Sriv astava, Lambert, & Vietmeyer, 1996). A fundamental difference between the WHO and the World Bank wa s their varying concepts of health and its role in development, which have changed over ti me. These bodies are not cohesive, neutral or static organisations; they are also subject to ex ternal trends and must mediate internal political interests. Promotion of policies and strategies by these two bodies is the outcome of the interaction of these interests, within the br oader political and economic climate. At times their policies and programmes may mutually rei nforce each other, and at times they may diverge. International bodies have been subject to crit icism for both exceeding their mandates or not fulfilling them, an d some consider that these bodies (like the UN itself) mirror and transmit (further perpetuating and reinforcin g) the balance of world power and domination of North over South (Turshen, 1993:987). 1.4.2 The state The state has a pivotal role in funding, structuring, co-ordinati ng and regulating the formal health care system (Walt, 1994:13-15). The political and economic decision s of the state affect the size, distribution, operation and quality of health ser vices infrastructure. In determining the scope and nature of health care systems, factor s such as access and 7 For example, in 1996, lending amounted to $2350 mill ion compared to $900 provided in grants by the WHO (Abbasi, 1999a:868). 16affordability, social equity and social justice, longer term s ustainability, economic efficiency, quality of care, and public interest and accountability may in form the policy making process (Hancock, 1999:7-10). In addition to a direct role in providing and regulating health care ser vices, the state has a broader role in the health status of populations, as many factors inte rplay in complicated ways and impinge on health outcomes (for example, housing, educati on, environmental and economic policies). Therefore, the role of the state in provision of heal th care and health care outcomes goes beyond the direct role it has in funding and structuring fo rmal health care infrastructure. It also performs a key role in mediating and balanc ing the interests of other stakeholders in the health policy arena such as medical syst ems, citizens, corporate interests and international bodies. 1.4.3 Medical systems Historically, there has been an uneasy and antagonistic relationsh ip between TRM/CAM and biomedicine. The history of the biomedical profession in the No rth has been described as one of consolidating a monopoly of power and stamping out competition fro m alternative health care systems (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a; Green, 1988:1129; Kaptchuk & Miller, 2005; Saks, 2003a; Starr, 1982). At various times, biomedical groups have tried to e liminate chiropractors, acupuncturists, homeopaths and naturopaths, Freund, McGuire, & Podhurst, 2003).8 This also occurred more overtly and aggressively in colonised countries in the South, as mentioned, an d conflict between practitioners of differing systems is still evident (Bodeker, 2001a; ed itorial, 2002b; Wolffers, 1990). In the development of national health programs based on Wes tern medicine official attitudes toward traditional healers have ranged from neglect to o utright opposition: they have been looked upon by most medical doctors as undesirable competit ors, if not outright enemies to be vanquished (Foster, 1977:533). These tensions can be attributed to differences in paradigms; diagnost ic and treatment methods; conceptions of illness, disease and health; and value s and interests. The various systems of health and medicine \u0093may be likened to different language s\u0094 (Jobst, 1996:319). The conceptual gulf between biomedicine and TRM systems has be en widely noted, and 8 The first endeavour of the American Medical Associ ation after formation in 1847 was to ban referrals to non- biomedical doctors and healers (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:544). 17McKinlay considers that they are based on ultimately irreconcila ble presuppositions that evolve from divergent social philosophies (1998:5). Biomedicine is a relatively recent medical system, having emerge d from \u0093shamanistic roots\u0094 in only the last 150-200 years (Cunningham & Andrews, 1997:7; Glasser, 1988:1461). Biomedicine began diverging from other systems of medicine and healt h care in the first half of the nineteenth century following the industrial revolution, wh en it aligned itself with the \u0093new enlightenment ideology of science\u0094 (acquiring the language of sci ence) and began to professionalise (Saks, 2003a:143). It differentiated itself from co mpetitors and obtained a privileged position in that process, forming a legal monopoly on f ormal health care provision and market domination (Freund, McGuire, & Podhurst, 2003:214; Kelner et a l., 2004:917; Lee, 1982; Saks, 1998, 2003a; Waldram, 2000). Biomedicine has historically maintained structural power thr ough alliances with corporate interests and professional elites and has a symbiotic relation ship with the pharmaceutical industry (Moran & Alexander, 1997; Unschuld, 1976b:9), sometimes 1995; Navarro, 1993). Biomedica l and pharmaceutical corporate interests can be linked together as an interest group, as they are usually considered \u0093allies\u0094, and form a structurally dominant coalition in modern health care systems (Light, 1995:36). While the multi-national pharmaceutical industry plays a cruc ial role in health policy as a key stakeholder in its own right, it is beyond the scope of this research to consider it as a separate interest group. It has therefore been grouped wi th biomedical interests, although it is acknowledged that a more detailed analysis of the role of the pharmaceutical industry is a pre-requisite for a comprehensive inquiry into in tegration. Practitioner groups instead form the main focus of this thesis. In general, biomedicine is based on a mechanistic or reductionist vie w that focuses on physical biology, illness and specific aetiology, with a conception of heal th as being the absence of disease. This is a \u0093downstream\u0094, curative or tertiar y focus (pathogenic). In contrast, TRM/CAM (while embracing diverse practices) tends to be based on an holistic view of health where achieving and maintaining equilibrium is t he goal \u0096 an \u0093upstream\u0094, preventative or primary focus (salutogenic) (Macdonald, 2005:52-56, 58-70). Health is more broadly considered as internal and external balance, incorporating emotional, psychological and social factors.9 9 See also (Gerke & Jacobson, 1996; Islam & e, & Youn g, 1993; Shanker, 1991) for further discussion on difference s between biomedicine and traditional medicine. For historical overviews of the development of, relationship and dif ferences between, biomedicine and CAM see Saks (1992a ) 18 The concept of health espoused by TRM/CAM is ironically very si milar to the definition of health used by the WHO \u0096 complete physical, mental and social we ll being (van der Geest, 1997:905). Van Der Geest lists four salient characteristics of TRM a s their social character, religious dimension, orientation to prevention, and comprehensive c oncepts of illness incorporating entire environment and general well being (1997:904-905). Fo od is central, with \u0093food therapy\u0094 or an emphasis on diet a main aspect. Some TRM p ractitioners believe that nothing should be used as a medicine that cannot also be used as food (Trawick, 1987:1034). The difference in focus can be illustrated with an example of pa yment for services \u0096 in some TRM systems, payment is only made when an individual is well (Scrims haw, 2001:63), reflecting the goal to prevent rather than treat disease. Another reflection of the different focus is in the use of metaphors to describe the human body. Biomedic ine considers the human a \u0093machine\u0094 regulated by laws of physics and science which ca n be taken apart and reassembled by a doctor, or have parts replaced when they break down (Lupton, 1994:59-61; Macdonald, 1992:37-39). This engineering model is premised on a doctrine of a singular cause and process of disease ( specific aetiology ) which is universal, and can be isolated, removed or treated according to common methods (Freund, McGui re, & Podhurst, 2003:6-7, 221-223). Modern Ayurvedic (Indian TRM) texts use the metaphor of the body being like a car which needs good fuel, removal of toxic build-up and regular maintenance of parts to keep operating smoothly (Chauhan, 2000; Sharma & Clark, 1998:109). More emphas is is consequently on food, diet, and physical therapies as lifestyl e practices to maintain balance in physical health. Although they have very sophisticated remedies to treat disease, they focus on maintaining health (preventing the \u0093car\u0094 breaking down).10 Ancient Egyptian medicine used a metaphor of a river and Chinese tradition is based on t he balance of elemental forces (Freund, McGuire, & Podhurst, 2003:7). Biomedicine and TRM/CAM therefore visualise the body and concepts of health and treatment differently. (Great Britain); (Baer, 2001) (United States) and Berliner and Salmon (1980a) (United States and Euro pe). For a description of social and historical foundation of biomedicine (Davis & George, 1993), and the relation ship between biomedicine, technology, power (Moran & Alexander, 1997). Unschuld (1987; 1993) proposes that the diff erences between Western and Chinese medicine have been over- simplified and exaggerated, and it is acknowledged that the differences, as presented here, are generalisat ions. 10 Ayurveda did use surgical techniques, and invented b oth procedures and surgical tools that are still wi dely used today in biomedicine (e.g. rhinoplasty, and glaucom a operations) (Chauhan, 2000). 19Peabody et al. describe the main differences as being that biomedici ne focuses on drugs and drug therapy, and TRM on diet, lifestyle, herbal treatments, physica l exercises, religious practices and psychological support (1999:126-127). A biomedical doctor \u0093treats the disease\u0094 while a TRM doctor \u0093treats the person (who happens to be ill) \u0094 (Neumann & Lauro, 1982:1818). In addition to differing techniques and conceptions of health an d disease, TRM may have a central foundation built on spirituality, religion and belie f (Adams, 2003; Eskinazi & Mindes, 2001:20). Some forms of TRM make distinction betwee n healing and religion (Barbee, 1986:77; Koumare, 1983). The vital role of the mind is also r ecognised, and is considered supremely important in both governing health m aximising behaviour, interaction with the physical environment, and regulation of emo tions. Peace of mind is one criteria for well being in Ayurveda, and if you are not happy you are not c onsidered healthy regardless of physical condition (Chauhan, 2000). This interlinking of religion and the mind within conceptual foundati ons of TRM is the antithesis of Cartesian scientific materialism upon which biomed ical systems are based. TRM systems view a person as more than the sum of their biological parts, with intangible aspects such as the \u0093soul\u0094, the \u0093subtle body\u0094 or \u0093life force\u0094 ( prana , chi) playing a significant role in quality of life and general health. Diseases may have s upernatural or emotional/psychological origins, and causative factors and treatme nts may not be able to be reduced to strictly biological terms (Berliner & Salmon, 1980b:142). In c ontrast, scientific materialism and positivism reduces the body to a cluster of cell s which are dealt with in isolation, and any non-visible parts (mind and soul) are split from th e body (Macdonald, 1992:38-39) and relegated to the realm of superstition or myth (or at leas t beyond therapeutic boundaries: the observable). While TRM is often criticised for a lack of scientific foundatio n, practitioners of these systems argue that this is an ethnocentric bias that fails to appre ciate \u0093alternatives in 1991:5) theory (Sharma & Clark , 1998). Some TRM systems have complex, internally coherent and logical theoreti cal bases, with elaborate concepts of disease, pharmacology, physiology, diet and nutrition. Thi s is the case with medical systems of Asia such as Ayurveda, Unani and Chinese me dicine (Leslie & Young, 1993:5). If science is considered a systematic body of knowledge, these medica l schools of thought clearly have a scientific (although culturally specific) f oundation. Scientific method is not confined only to biomedicine (Alderete, 1996:383; Lantum, 1982:17; Rampra sad, 1994:135). The literal translation Ayurveda is \u0093the science of life \u0094 and Sorig-pa (Tibetan medicine) is \u0093the science of healing\u0094. 20Science can be seen to represent a struggle between rival ideologi es (Trawick, 1987:1032). The common dismissal of TRM systems by biomedicine on account of a lack of sufficient clinical evidence derives from the viewpoint of Western scient ific rationalism, which is considered by many to be impartial and therefore universally applica ble. The global dominance of this paradigm means the legitimacy of TRM/CAM has to be der ived from conforming to the parameters of biomedicine (Quah, 2003; Shanker, 1991). Howe ver, it has been noted that many biomedical treatments lack evidence as to the ir pharmacology or exactly how they work \u0096 aspirin is one example (Airhihenbuwa, 1995:57; Dale n, 1998; Unschuld, 1976b:7). In addition, many aspects of TRM are considered b eyond the realm of scientific measurement and are \u0093theoretically inexplicable within the domain of scientific discourse\u0094 (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:543). Unschuld concludes that dismissing TRM on account of its \u0093non-scien tific\u0094 basis is motivated by ideological and political factors, and that if bi omedicine abandoned all drugs and techniques that were not understood \u0093not very much would remai n\u0094 (1976b:7), a position with which Berliner and Salmon concur (1980b:142).11 Although these observations were made some time ago, contemporary commentators continue to as sert that biomedicine is usually less scientific than it appears, and the scientific validity distinction between biomedicine and TRM is \u0093more apparent than real\u0094: the clinical basis for many Western and TRM therapies is o bservational and empirical without strong scientific support. Thus, both types of medicine need to be subjected to more scientific scrutiny, and there may be no compelling reason in many situations to favour one style of treatment over another (Peabody et al., 1999:127). Both biomedical and TRM systems have strengths and weaknesses , advantages and disadvantages, costs and benefits (Jonas & Levin, 1999:4). Both types of medicine and health care have treatment modalities that exhibit ambiguity of efficacy (Elling, 1981b). In addition, all systems of health and medicine are the products of their social, cultural and historical contexts, and thus reflect particular values and practi ces that are embedded within those origins. Accordingly, biomedicine is only one form of \u0093ethnomedicin e\u0094 (Amarasigham Rhodes, 1990; Maclean & Bannerman, 1982). Biomedicine, despite being culturally constructed, has somehow det ached itself from its socio-cultural origins and achieved an entrenched global penetration, a \u0093monolithic orthodoxy\u0094 associated with its ideology of \u0093science\u0094. The history of this diffusion indicates 11 Smith (1991) assessed that only 15% of biomedical treatments have a \u0093scientific basis\u0094 or have clearl y demonstrated effectiveness. 21that its success as a competitive social and cultural institution has been far greater than efficacy alone explains (Riley, 1977:557). There is no rival, coherent system of medicine which has managed to successfully challenge this ideological supremac y (Frankenberg, 1981:115). [Biomedicine] is inherently assumed to have an internally coherent, self-evident, and objective validity. This assumed validity is so taken for granted in western society that suggestions that other systems of medicine may also have validity a re often rejected out of hand. Western superiority in economic, technological, and military spheres has perpetuated the assumption that scientific medicine is likewise far superior to its predecessors and competitors. Even the referent of \u0093scientific\u0094 exemplif ies having reached a pinnacle of achievement, implying that other systems of medicine are non-sc ientific, being based upon lesser foundations (Salmon, 1984:3). Unschuld determines that the major difference between tradit ional Chinese medicine and biomedicine is in their conceptions of \u0093truth\u0094 \u0096 biomedicine has a found ation that is built on an assumed single, dominant paradigm; an \u0093either or mentality\u0094; a unive rsal truth that can be isolated and determined by logic; \u0093Western civilization [is] a cu lture searching for and believing in, the existence of one single truth it is reflected in a c ontinuous attempt to build one coherent scientific paradigm, free from internal i nconsistencies or contradictions\u0094 (Unschuld, 1993:57-58).12 The application of this scientific paradigm creates \u0093biomedic al artefacts masquerading as universal truths\u0094 (Waldram, 2000:619). In co ntrast, Unschuld proposes that traditional Chinese medicine accepts a \u0093pattern ed knowledge\u0094 \u0096 the existence of multiple, even antagonistic \u0093truths\u0094. Biomedical and TRM practitioners are not homogenous groups, forming unified , discrete blocs that are rigidly demarcated. Some TRM practitioners use aspec ts of biomedicine, such as prescribing antibiotics and analgesics, or using stethoscopes, w hite coats and blood pressure cuffs (Bhatia et al., 1975; Kleinman, 1984:148; Taylor, 1976; van der G eest & Reynolds Whyte, 1989). Conversely, some biomedical doctors in the North h ave found it lucrative to practice what has been termed \u0093integrative\u0094 or \u0093integrated\u0094 medicine, which selectively incorporates aspects of TRM/CAM alongside biomedical diagnosis and treatment (Cowley, Underwood, & Braiker, 2002; Rees & Weil, 2001; Weil, 2001). TRM systems and practitioners vary widely in scope. There are herb alists, traditional birth attendants, bone-setters, dentists, faith healers and diviners, a mongst others (Oppong, 1989). It is the heterogeneous nature of TRM that presents one of the obstacles to formally using it 12 The union between science and a single, resilient \u0093truth\u0094 was originally threatened by Kuhn (1970), w ho proposed that such truths are replaced by new paradigms, new \u0093truths\u0094 that displace the previous ones as they are falsified (Gillett, 1994:1125). Kuhn countered the concept th at there were universal rules of evidence for making scientific judgements and that science is a neutral activity (S aks, 1998:201). 22in health care systems (Bannerman, 1983:320). There is a particular dive rgence between Asian and African systems of TRM, with the former based on system atised knowledge that has been recorded and is taught in state recognised institutions (D eJong, 1991:1; Last, 1986:12). This may be one reason for the comparison noted by Zwi and Mills (1995:301) - Asian systems of medicine have proven \u0093more resilient in their cla sh\u0094 with biomedicine. It is claimed that TCM and Ayurveda (both Asian systems) are used by approx imately half of the world\u0092s population, with published clinical research worldwide (McI ntyre, 2001:10). The degree of sophistication of Asian TRM systems (Ayurveda, Un ani and Chinese medicine) means they may share more similarities with biomedi cine than with other TRM systems of health (Young, 1983:1205). However, even these more formal ised TRM systems are not cohesive, consisting of an overlapping diversity of sub-systems ( Nordstrom, 1988; Unschuld, 1975). Lock (1990:41) notes that biomedicine also varies widely in beliefs and practices, with many specialities, and differences between r egions. Despite greater \u0093ideological coherence\u0094, biomedicine consists of an increasingly compl ex division of labour (Saks, 1998:205) and is culturally reinterpreted in local setting s (Finkler, 2004). The fundamental differences in philosophies, heterogeneity of TRM systems and practitioners, and asymmetric power relationships, lead some to c onclude that genuine integration may be impossible or even undesirable. A policy to combine two systems of medicine where there is power disequilibrium usually results in the domination of one over the other (Islam, 1994; van der Geest, 1985:12). So, the question remains, nea rly three decades after integration was proposed: \u0093How can the collision of s uch seemingly irreconcilable medical cultures be managed so as to yield mu tual benefits?\u0094 (Gerke & Jacobson, 1996). While this question is beyond the scope of the research, it indicates the complexity of issues the policy of integration raises, and practi cal difficulties of implementation. 1.4.4 Citizens (consumers) The main benefit of formalising the role of TRM/CAM in health sys tems should flow to citizens. Consumers often have the weakest voice in the formulat ion of health policy, exercising influence through patronage and consumption. The surviv al of TRM in the South, in the face of strong competition from biomedicine and monopolistic heal th systems, was due to continuing support from citizens. Although figures vary be tween countries, the WHO estimates that between 60% and 90% of populations in the South use TRM to meet health care needs (WHO, 2002e). In these countries, TRM has the advantag e of usually being more 23acceptable, accessible and affordable Green, 1986:121; Sofowora, 1996:366).13 Studies have found that citizens in the South exercise relatively s ophisticated forms of medical pluralism. There appears to be a preference for TRM t o treat some conditions (chronic), while biomedical treatment is sought for others (in fectious/acute), and this pattern has been observed across diverse cultures; from Nepal and Tibet t o Bolivia, Mexico, Swaziland and Zaire (Adhikari, Tamang & Dixit, 1992:43; Yoder, 1982:1855). These types of health care are not regarded as substitutes for one another, but fulfi l specific health requirements (DeJong, 1991:7). This pattern of dual utilisation has c reated a \u0093defacto division of labour\u0094 between the medical systems (Green & Makhubu, 1984:1073), although the same patterns of use is not apparent in all societies (Caldwell et al., 1989:371). This broadly parallels attitudes in the North, which began to eme rge in the 1960s and 1970s but was only recognised as an established trend in the 1990s. In the US, by 1990 visits to CAM practitioners outnumbered visits to biomedical practitione rs (Tataryn, 2002:877). The turning point for the recognition of this trend was a study by Eisen berg in 1993, which found that 34% of American adults had used therapies other than biomedicine ( CAM). The use of CAM increased by another 25% between 1990 and 1997; the percentage of America ns taking herbs nearly quadrupled (Cowley, Underwood, & Braiker, 2002); an d sales of herbal supplements increased by 101% between 1996 and 1998 (WHO, 2002e:12). It became clear that the use of TRM/CAM was not based only on tradition o r necessity, but was also a choice that those with higher educations and income s were exercising in greater numbers (Astin, 1998; Lupton, 1997). The use of TRM has been interprete d as a personal counter-hegemonic commentary on the failure of modernisation, urba nisation and development which biomedicine symbolises (Wayland, 2004). The personal m ixing of biomedical and TRM/CAM can be considered pragmatic, as well a s a form of \u0093cultural politics\u0094 in which identity, control and power can be expressed (Why te et.al. 2002 in Craig, 2000; Crandon-Malamud, 1991; Wayland, 2004:2411). In the global WHO TRM Strategy 2002-2005 (WHO, 2002e), the potential efficacy of TRM to treat chronic, lifestyle-related conditions unresponsive to biom edicine was mentioned. 13 Some have questioned these assumptions (Anyinam, 1 987). 24However, the rapidly growing market in the North raised new policy is sues. In 2002 the WHO estimated that the global trade for remedies based on TRM was U S$60 billion.14 In some countries, consumer\u0092s annual spending on TRM/CAM outstripped that on biomedicine (WHO, 2002e:12). Once the use of TRM moved beyond local or national boundaries a nd into the global sphere, a host of public health and regulatory matters needed resolution (Bodeker & Kronenberg, 2002; Deng, 2002). 1.5 Aim and scope of research As the foregoing history and context demonstrates, the global policy of integrating TRM into health care systems has had a long gestation internationally and un even implementation nationally. This \u0093rational\u0094 policy goal has proven extremely diffi cult to execute on national levels, despite apparent international consensus and support and prac tical grounds for its utility. Why integration is so problematic to implement, and why this issue reappeared on the global agenda (with CAM) in 2002, is the main focus of this research . This addresses the question: \u0093Why did the issue of integration arise on the internati onal policy agenda in the 1970s, become submerged in the following decades with minimal national level adoption, and then reappear in 2002?\u0094 Examination of these questions as a case study in health policy d evelopment and implementation also aims to illuminate some of the broader questi ons raised by researchers in relation to global health policy. How appropriate are universal policy models that are driven by \u0093top-down\u0094 approaches?15 What are some of the forces behind convergence of policy proposals? What are the requirements for successful tra nsfers of global health sector reform policies? What is the impact of international initiatives a t country levels and what are the practical implications of these initiatives (such as cost bur dens)? Is there \u0093lesson drawing\u0094 on what works and for what reasons in health policy devel opment? Are certain values promoted and transmitted globally through international or ganisations? (Buse & Manderson, The research does not attempt to provide definitive \u0093answers\u0094 to the se questions, but rather to explore their relevance and application in relation to the issue of integration. The detailed 14 If improvements in people\u0092s health and capacities are factored in, the total economic value in the Uni ted States in 1996 alone was at the very least US$68 billion annu ally. The country reaps a financial dividend about si x times the market value of the plant products themselves (Srivast ava, Lambert, & Vietmeyer, 1996:4). 15 \u0093Top down\u0094 approaches can refer to within an organ isation, at national levels or at a global level fro m international bodies. This research looks at the latter forms of \u0093top down\u0094 approaches - international bodies drivin g policy directions at national levels, or national level pro cesses. 25analysis of integration as a case study of global health policy aims to offer some insight into these issues, and provide information which may assist other re searchers in the health field to clarify such broader questions. In exploring such questions, the global\u0096local interface in terms of policy transfer (Buse et al., 2002:271), the processes of this policy transfer, and the role of inter national organisations in that process are deemed worthy of further attention. Therefore, the focus of this research is on the history of a specific global health policy ( integration of TRM), its development within an international organisation (WHO), and how readily it was tra nsferred to local/national levels. The aims are twofold: 1. To identify, develop or synthesise a theoretical model or frame work which will adequately explain why the policy goal of integration has proven extremely di fficult to execute on national levels, despite apparent international consensus and suppor t 2. To contribute to the understanding of the policy processes within the complex, contradictory and contested health field In the following chapter, theories to analyse health policy are des cribed and assessed. A framework to explore the evolution of the global policy of integra tion is proposed, which will then be tested in the main body of the thesis. This framew ork offers a new, alternative approach to current theories used to analyse health policy. The s tructure of the thesis is also outlined, and the methodology used to gather data elaborated upon. 26 2. Methodology 2.1 The search for an explanatory model To systematically explore the questions arising from the evolution of the global policy of integration of TRM, and its global-local transfer, requires an anal ytical framework. This framework or model needs to take into account key factors mentioned i n the introduction, including the role and behaviour of actors (such as organisations and interes t groups). The search for such an explanatory model has necessitated the consid eration of how health policy is currently analysed and what methods other researchers in the he alth field have used to explore health policy questions. This chapter describes a pote ntial explanatory model, building on the strengths of existing frameworks. Ham (1993) outlines three main approaches to considering power distributi on and the dynamics of policy making in health services \u0096 Marxist (class re lations within a capitalist system), pluralist (compromises between interest groups), and Alford\u0092s structuralist model. The structuralist framework divides groups competing for health resources into three, rival \u0093structural interests\u0094. These are firstly, the \u0093professiona l monopoly\u0094 ( dominant structural interests), comprising biomedical professions and other health o ccupations. They are served by the social, political and economic institutions. Secondly, the \u0093corp orate rationalisers\u0094 (challenging structural interests) consist of public health agencies, insura nce companies and planners and administrators. Finally, the community ( repressed structural interests) usually lack the organisation to promote their interests. While pluralism emphasises the dispersion of power amongst interes t groups, structural approaches conceive of power as being unequally spread and concentr ated in a few groups or an elite (Davis, 2002:942). Although Ham concedes that each has weaknes ses, the structuralist framework as espoused by Alford (1975) is considered to offer the most analytical promise as it incorporates the strengths of pluralist th eory with the insights of Marxist analysis (Ham, 1993:190). Alford\u0092s structuralist theory has proven a popular approach to ex amining health policy and health services, primarily in the North. However, it may not offe r the same value in considering health policy issues in the South, where the \u0093professi onal monopoly\u0094 group is more complex in organisation. Increasingly, its validity in the No rth may also be 27questionable as the biomedical monopoly\u0092s authority is reduced and n ew medical traditions (CAM) threaten its sovereignty in health systems. Cho (2000b) is one of the few analysts to apply the Alfordian framework outside of Western democracies. The c ontext was health policy in South Korea, in order to explore the prolonged and intense confl ict between biomedical (pharmacists) and traditional (oriental) profess ionals. Cho (2000b) concluded that while the structuralist approach \u0093can be usef ul\u0094 in the analysis of health policy in South Korea, it also raised some difficultie s. The cleavage within the professional monopoly group (biomedical/TRM) diverged from the sta ndard inter- professional conflict as contended by Alford, in several respec ts. For example, the rivalry was between radically different medical systems (not within one system), and the extent and nature of the competition far exceeded normal inter-professi onal friction. The thesis that heterogenous interests within the professional monopoly will act toge ther when their autonomy is threatened, as predicted by Alford, was not demonstra ted in the South Korean case. Instead, the \u0093united collective front of professional monop olist seemed to have completely collapsed\u0094 which was \u0093a significant departure from t he main thrust of Alford\u0092s analysis\u0094 (Cho, 2000b). Professional activity in pluralistic medica l systems appears more complex than Alford\u0092s theory allows for, with Cho resorting to iden tifying it as a \u0093bipartite\u0094 professional monopoly in order to fit within the framework. Cho contends that Alford\u0092s theory still offers a more plausible e xplanation of this conflict than conventional pluralistic theories. However, the findings illus trate that Alford\u0092s model does not effectively account for a \u0093duopoly\u0094 \u0096 for example, where one m edical system is structurally and politically dominant (biomedicine) and an other socially and culturally dominant (TRM). Instead, social, political and economic instituti ons are expected to serve only one medical profession or system (within which there is a hierarchy of \u0093 sub- professions\u0094), ultimately unifying under pressure due to a common ident ity and interests. More recently, the Alford framework of structural interests was applied in a Canadian study of biomedicine and CAM (Kelner et al., 2004). However, in this analysi s, CAM was placed in the community (repressed) category rather than professional m onopoly (dominant biomedicine) category. This perspective allowed for two separate heal th profession stakeholders to compete with each other for power and resources i n the health system. However, it presented some problems in distinguishing which health prof essionals should be placed within each group. For example, nurses and other allie d professionals, such as chiropractors and naturopaths, are members of the dominant group but are also repressed by them (Kelner et al., 2004:918). 28 The analytical perspective used by Kelner et al. (2004) (which placed CAM in the community group) was also a significant modification of Alfor d\u0092s structural theory which undermined its main premise \u0096 that of one health professional group in interplay with two other stakeholders with distinct interests (the community, the gove rnment/health agencies); not another health profession group with directly competing interes ts. In addition, the community (repressed) group is defined by Alford as lacking organi sation, which is not a characteristic of CAM despite its weaker status in formal healt h care systems. The application of Alford\u0092s structural theory to analyse hea lth policy where medical pluralism exists has therefore demonstrable weaknesses . Despite it offering the most analytical promise according to Ham (1993:190), it falls short of acco mmodating actors that play a role in health policy but are categorised outside of the thr ee rival interests (professional monopoly, corporate, community). While thes e rival interests still exist, the contemporary health policy landscape has become more complicat ed and different interests have entered the domain in ways that may not have been envisage d when Alford developed his framework in 1975. 2.2 An alternative approach According to Ham, while all three approaches (Marxist, plurali st and structuralist) have merit, none offers a complete account independently (1993:183). He propose s that, rather than seeking to develop one overarching theory that could provide an expl anation of health policy in its own right, searching for links between different theori es could prove more fruitful. This would produce \u0093mediating frameworks to connect macro- theory with specific policy issues\u0094 (Dunleavy 1981:4 in Ham, 1993:183). Similarly, the use of macro-mi cro models to explore medical pluralism, that take into account broa der political and economic contexts, has been encouraged by medical anthropologists (Janzen , 1978; Singer, 1986, 1990). Walt and Gilson (1994) also call for new approaches, and lament the lac k of policy analysis applied to issues of the South, and to health questions in particular. They argue that rather than focusing totally on the content of reform, the actors (at international, national, sub- national levels), processes contingent upon developing and implementing change and the context within which the policy is developed all need to be considered (1994:358). Othe r analysts began to look beyond conventional theories of power and change in the health 29policy domain, such as the roles of networks and coalitions, or polit ical parties (Geva-May & Maslove, 2000; Lee & Goodman, 2002; Peterson, 1993). Walt and Gilson (1994) consider their model (a triangulation of context , content and process with actors located inside) to have greater explanatory power th an classic, landmark policy- making theories such as the incremental model (Lindblom, 1959) and the ra tional model (Simon, 1957). The model is classified with political economy approa ches \u0096 that is, it considers the interaction between political, economic and social f actors. Walt\u0092s b ook ( 1994) on health policy was also an effort to inject a greater emphasis on process and power in health policy discussion and debate. The framework proposed by Walt and Gilson (1994) shares similarities to that developed by Kingdon (1984), which Walt discus ses in her book on health policy processes (1994). Walt used Kingdon\u0092s framework to explore issues of health policy tran sfer between international and national levels, and found it particularly ap t (Ogden, Walt, & Lush, 2003). The issue analysed was the global transfer of tuberculosis cont rol policy, also over a thirty year period. Kingdon (1984) based his model on another classic theory in polic y literature \u0096 the \u0093garbage-can model of organisational choice\u0094 (Cohen, March, & O lsen, 1972). These approaches counter theories that describe policy in increm ental, rational or hierarchical terms. The policy process is instead presented as more anarchic a nd fluid, with various problems and solutions mingling in an ambiguous policy environment . While it is commonly agreed that policy making usually follows a \u0093process\u0094 of setting an agenda, specifying alternatives, making choices, followed by implementation (and usual ly evaluation); what is open to contested interpretation is how the agenda is set, and why ce rtain alternatives are chosen. 2.2.1 Kingdon\u0092s multiple streams model Kingdon attempts to conceptualise the policy process in order to take into account these variables. The policy environment ( context ) is likened to a \u0093primeval soup\u0094 within which various policy communities ( actors ) move. The development of policy proposals ( content ) is \u0093evolutionary\u0094 in a process that is considered \u0093akin to biological natural selection\u0094. Various ideas and issues are \u0093floated, translated into proposals, disc ussed, revised and honed and floated again\u0094 (1984:226), flowing on and off the agenda. Kingdon is more con cerned with what makes particular ideas popular, than with where the idea origin ated, and considers the \u0093critical thing to understand is not where the seed comes from, but wh at makes the soil fertile\u0094 (1984:77). In other words, like Walt and Gilson (1994), he stresses context . 30 Kingdon\u0092s model manages to systematise what otherwise may appear to be random processes. He identifies three separate streams which operate largely independently of each other and run through decision-making units (organisations, gove rnments). These \u0093process streams\u0094 are politics (ideology, public opinion, interest groups, officials, political part ies); policies (generation of ideas within communities such as academics, bureauc rats, interest groups); and problems (problem recognition). The key to understanding when and why certain policies are adopted, or the agenda changes, is the coupling (linking) of these streams . \u0093A problem is recognized, a solution is available, the political climate makes the time right for change\u0094 (1984:86). This co upling occurs when an opportunity arises through a window opening in the political or problem streams . When a window opens (for example, new administration, personnel changes), a pr oposal or alternative is pulled out of the policy stream . It therefore becomes elevated on the agenda because it is seen as a solution to a \u0093pressing problem\u0094 or \u0093spons orship is expedient\u0094 (1984:172). The combination of all three streams dramatically en hances the chances that an issue will seriously receive attention (Zahariadis, 1999:76). Kingdon places importance on the role of specific people in the policy process ( policy entrepreneurs ), and specific issues (catalysts ) that open windows. These key actors seize and exploit opening windows to push a favoured policy onto the agenda. Kingdon\u0092s model offers a useful way to consider the policy issue of in tegrating TRM into health care systems as it enables questions like: \u0093Why did th e issue of integration arise on the international health policy agenda in the 1970s, become submerged i n the following decades, only to reappear (with CAM) in 2002?\u0094 While the issue of integ ration remained alive in the policy stream, being propounded, re-assessed and debated within the poli cy community, the broader environment was not fertile for implemen tation. During the 1990s, the conditions developed to allow the window to open again, and in 2002 the streams coupled and the strategy was endorsed on a global level. However, as this analysis will demonstrate, the scope of the problem had changed, and the reasons for sponsorship differed. The selection and analysis of documents and other data which forms the empirical research in this thesis will therefore be guided by the mediating framewo rk offered by Kingdon (1984). As noted by Walt and Gilson (1994), analysing the interaction bet ween political, social and economic factors is basically a political economy approac h. However, using Kingdon\u0092s model allows the policy issue to be contextualised further, by linking the politics , problems , and policy streams . The practical application of the framework offered by 31Kingdon, in addition to an explanatory model for the behaviour of inte rest groups, is the subject of the main body of the thesis. 2.2.2 Unschuld\u0092s theory of medico-cultural conflict Within the politics stream, an analytical tool will be used to consider the relations hip between interest groups. If emphasis is placed on resource alloc ation, the policy of integration can be viewed as the outcome of contested resources, m ainly between two stakeholders in the health system \u0096 biomedical and traditional practi tioners. Conflicts and tension in formulating and implementing this policy can be perceiv ed as a struggle to control resources by competing interest groups, who manipulate the policy proc ess. Unschuld (1975; 1976b) offers a theory which is a useful way to characterise the politi cal relationship between these two groups. Unschuld proposes that \u0093medical [health] systems represent a mo mentary stage in the continuous competition of various groups for medical resources \u0094 (Unschuld, 1975:304). According to Unschuld, conflict between these groups is an outcome of competition for primary and secondary resources. Primary resources are medical knowledge and skills, drugs or remedies, technology, techniques, equipment and facilities. Secondary resources are material or non-material rewards (status, prestige, authority ) for medical practice. Dominating primary resources controls access to the secondary reso urces (1975:304). Therefore, different systems of medicine compete for acce ss to the available secondary resources (material and non-material rewards) through controlli ng and promoting their primary resource base (remedies, techniques, knowledge). It is impor tant to note that manpower itself is not classified as a resource, as it rema ins a competitor for available secondary resources.16 In order to gain more control over particular resources related to their occupation, the groups embark on a process of professionalisation.17 MacCormack (1986) describes this process as 16 Drugs, techniques, manpower and concepts are consi dered dimensions of medical systems, which offer areas suitable for \u0093structured co-existence\u0094 with other sy stems \u0096 in order of difficulty (Unschuld, 1976b:7). Pederson and Baruffati (1989), analysing asymmetrica l power relationships between biomedical and TRM sy stems, produced a very similar classification (technologies, practitioners, ideological substratum), although l acking the detail and dynamics of interaction offered by Unsch uld. Chi (1994) considers medical technology and kno wledge, personnel, and other resources (drugs, equipment) a s the main distinguishing factors between different medical systems. 17 Professionalisation and its processes, purposes an d outcomes in the health field have preoccupied man y academics. It is beyond the scope of this research to consider the vast literature and theoretical appr oaches to professionalisation in the health care sphere. For the purposes of this analysis, the perspective of Un schuld is employed - which considers professionalisation only as a method to maintain occupational power and cont rol, although not all commentators agree that this is ne cessarily the case. Unschuld\u0092s view on professionali sation varies from other theorists in that it is not concerned wit h processes and hierarchies, but is related to an categorisation. Professionalisation only needs to be seen as a met hod for exerting or expressing group power, and as a technique to control, protect and pro mote their primary resources. It involves identifying and claiming their respective prima ry resources, and determining who has access to the secondary resources that accrue f rom their use (economic and social benefits). While Unschuld\u0092s analysis related to Asia, Last (1986) also de veloped a similar conclusion regarding professionalisation in reference to Africa. He propos es that the process of professionalisation for TRM practitioners which has occurred ther e is an aspect of decolonisation, and developed in response to increasing competition from an expanding biomedical profession (1986:10). This had already occurred in China a nd India in the 19th century when biomedicine became a competitor in those regions. Ay urveda and traditional Chinese medicine only began to professionalise with the import of biomedicine, directly in response to the new encroachment (Unschuld, 1976b:18). Unschuld hypothesises that competing medical systems will neve r voluntarily exchange or share primary resources, without obtaining secondary resources ( economic benefits, status) in return. \u0093[W]here two or more groups compete for possession of, or control over, certain resources it is extremely difficult to have these different g roups work together and share the resources available, except under coercion and close government supervision \u0094 (Unschuld, 1976b:8, emphasis added). Therefore, in the absence of coercion and supe rvision, the rejection or adoption of particular primary resources by interest grou ps is dependant upon the incentives offered in the form of secondary resources. Shifting pri mary resources from one group to another is easier, once it is \u0093recognised that these reso urces will be of use in gaining access to more secondary resources\u0094 (Unschuld, 1976b:8). Although Unschuld does not explicitly state or discuss the orig in of secondary resources, it can be inferred that they are provided by citizens (consumers), th e state, and agencies such as insurance companies and donor bodies \u0096 through using, sanctioning or subsid ising particular primary resources. Citizens, communities, the government and adm inistrative/regulative bodies therefore have a key role in supplying secondary resources, through their use and legitimation of primary resources. Medical systems can thus incr ease their share of according to 1) who generates the knowledge the occu pational activities are based on 2) who determines w hen it is appropriate or permitted to apply that knowledge and 3) who defines the secondary resources attached to that application of knowledge. Therefore, biomedicine it self has not obtained full professional status as i t is dependant upon state and corporate players (e.g. insurance co mpanies) in the determination of 2 and 3 (Unschuld 2004, personal communication). 33secondary resources through enlarging their primary resource base; m inimising their competitor\u0092s primary resource base; or appealing for support and legit imation from providers of secondary resources. Several anthropologists have made passing reference to Unschuld\u0092s t heory of medico- cultural conflict, as a method to conceptualise medic systems (Janes, Leslie, 1980; Press, 1980). Crandon-Malamud (1991) us es a variant of the theory in a study of Bolivia, and argues that medical plu ralism provides communities with secondary resources that permit social mobil ity (Crandon-Malamud, 1991:ix). This analysis is from the perspective of the patient or communi ty, and argues that they choose to use different medical systems (primary resour ces) to seek a cure but also for social, economic, and/or political ends (secondary resources). Thi s variation extrapolates beyond the \u0093ownership\u0094 or control of the health/medical resources b y practitioners, to the use of those resources by the community and what they gain from such patter ns of use. Secondary resources that flow from primary resources may therefore be obtained by consumers as well as practitioners, although the secondary resource s vary. The \u0093resource model\u0094 which is primarily based on an adaptation of U nschuld\u0092s theory of medico-cultural conflict, but also incorporates Crandon-Malamu d\u0092s (1991) extension and other themes from the literature, is displayed in Table 2. Health sys tems represent distribution patterns of medical resources, with different medica l systems simply \u0093primary resource aggregates\u0094 conceptualised differently from othe r primary resources (Unschuld, 1976b:16). Biomedicine can be considered resource aggregate 1 and TRM/CAM resource aggregate 2. The five-fold division of stakeholders in health sys tems parallels that noted by Light (1995), who identified various countervailing powers in the hea lth domain: the biomedical profession (with an optional additional alternate he aling modalities), the state, the medical-industrial complex, and patient groups. Each has differen t goals that are in tension with each other (in Kelner et al., 2004:917). State and corporate agencies are placed above citizens, to refle ct their authoritative role in filtering and structuring the resources that are available to the community in the formal health care sector and the market. Citizens can also operate outside of the formal health care system. Variables affecting use in the citizen category may incl ude income, age, gender, ethnicity, education, religion, location and health condition (disea se or illness) (see Barrett, 2003:418). These factors influence access to, selection, and expe rience of primary resources. Citizens \u0093oscillate\u0094 between the resource aggregates to cope with their health problems (Fabrega in Unschuld, 1976b:6). 34 Table 2: Resource Model Stakeholders Primary Resources (tools & methods) Secondary Resources (benefits) 1.

It separates out stakeholde rs from within the dominant, challenging and repressed categories, allows for medical pluralism and multiplies the potential configuration of relationships. Each stakeholder has di fferent interests, rationales, varying power/control and arenas for exerting that, and can form alli ances and networks that fluctuate historically according to context (economic, poli tical, social conditions). Alford\u0092s theory which is considered applicable worldwide can be viewed as the specific configuration or network of relationships in the United States in the mid-1970s, one of the momentary stages in the struggle for resources. The struggle for resources varie s and has different outcomes according to location, culture or points in time (Unschul d, 1975:304). Boundaries between primary resources are constructed by the profes sions (groups) themselves, and this is what they struggle over. The stratifica tions of professions/occupations within each resource aggregate may also engage in these stru ggles between themselves. So, for example \u0096 biomedicine may splinter into more specialised pro fessions or occupations, 35each claiming different primary resources (or creating a new one). Th e struggle over resources can therefore manifest within as well as between the groups, and also on community, regional or national levels. The struggles over primar y resources are driven by the need/desire to secure secondary resources and prevent comp eting groups from gaining them. As discussed in the body of the thesis, some challenges are pr esented by the TRM/CAM primary resource base in relation to integrating (formalising) the ir role in public health care systems, particularly but not confined to the religious or spiritual dim ensions (Bibeau, 1982, 1985; Maclean, 1986; Pearce, 1986). These systems have historically op erated in informal, private spheres and may be \u0093invisible\u0094 from the perspective of the stat e. TRM/CAM may even be banned, repressed, or formally ignored (as happened during colonisation), although they may be still highly respected and used extensively on commu nity levels. Therefore, the role and regulation of TRM/CAM primary resources in the formal hea lth care sphere may be problematic, and use in the private sphere is often where practitione rs obtain their secondary resources (status, prestige, authority, economic benefits). The main tenet of Unschuld\u0092s explanatory theory on the relatio nship between medical systems centres on contested resources . However, the definition of \u0093resources\u0094 moves beyond that typically used, so that not only fiscal appropriations f rom the state are contestable. A variety of health care and medical resources exi st (primary resources), the control of which has been staked out by various groups who claim exclu sive access to their use and the benefits that accrue from that use ( secondary resources). Both TRM/CAM and biomedical practitioners have different primary resource bases, and different ways to guard access to these resources. If access to the other\u0092s primary re sources cannot be acquired, \u0093they may simply be downplayed in their importance and subsequently neglect ed\u0094 (1975:311). Unschuld offers the example of acupuncture to illustrate this point.18 Another example of this tactic is the homoeopathic rejection of vaccinations and publicity camp aigns to discredit immunization (Cant & Sharma, 1996:585). 18 The observations upon which Unschuld based his the ory have also been noted as a distinct pattern by oth ers: \u0093Initially, orthodox groups either ignore these prac tices or attempt to undermine and suppress them by ma king them hard to access, by labelling them as quackery or ps eudo-science, and by disciplining those who use the m Later, if the influence of these practices grows, the main stream community begins to examine them and selectiv ely adopt practices into conventional medicine that eas ily fit \u0094 (Jonas & Levin, 1999:3). Armstrong (1987) notes that \u0093orthodoxy manages to control the threat from the unorthodox by a strategy of either marginalization or incorporation\u0094 (in Lock 1990:45). Baer (2001) comme nts that alternatives to biomedicine are co-opted b y biomedicine if they cannot be dismissed as ineffective (in Janes, 2002). See also Leslie (1980), Baer (198 1), Saks (1995b; 1998). 36Unschuld\u0092s hypothesis evolved in the same era as the anthropol ogical \u0093adversarial school\u0094, prominent in the 1970s. This school of thought considered that traditi onal and biomedical health care practitioners were rivals. For example, traditional healers needed to resist or adapt to the intruding biomedical system (Landy, 1974), or each system was fighting to obtain or preserve the loyalty of the community (Foster, 1977). Coreil explains that this approach to analysing health services was supplanted when it became clear that consumer behavi our was complex, and both TRM and biomedicine were used in diverse ways (1990:9-12). Anthropologists beg an to determine that medical pluralism operated in many different cont exts. One medical system did not necessarily displace the other in modern societies \u0096 they operated i n \u0093harmony\u0094. The focus shifted from conflict, adversarial behaviour and contest ed resources at the practitioner (group) level, to the citizen (individual) and their activities, patt erns of resort to health care services and the socio-cultural constructions of health issues. Th e issue of potential discord between practitioners of various systems was minimised, as this was not evident in utilisation of services. For example, Justice notes that Nepalese \u0093willingly used both traditional and modern medicine. It often appeared that only planners and government health pract itioners perceived conflict between different medical systems\u0094 (1986:95). Waxler (1984) sim ilarly proposed there was no conflict based on observations in Sri Lanka. The harmony ( oscillation) between primary resource aggregates, at the citizen or community level, has al so been noted by other authors and mentioned in the introductory chapter. This may explain why Unschuld\u0092s theory has been neglected as an analytical tool. Unschuld thinks it may have been too \u0093cynical\u0094 for medical anthropologists to accept (Unschuld 2004, personal communication), and any discussion of adversarial behaviou r may have been incongruous in the 1980s. However, this overlooks the nature of the actor, and the operation of interest groups. A focus of this research is on the behaviour and mot ivation of groups (practitioners, professionals), and their role in the policy proce ss. As this thesis demonstrates, the formulation and implementation of a policy on usi ng TRM/CAM in formal health care systems brings to a head conflict in demarcating resource boundaries \u0096 what primary resources are used in formal health care systems, who is allowed to use them, and how secondary resources are allocated (money/authority/statu s/prestige). This is primarily a question of politics \u0096 who gets what, when, and how (Lasswell, 1958). When Unschuld developed his theory, the increasing popularity of CAM in the North was not envisaged. It is this development that allows his theory to be appl ied on a global level, rather than just in Asian settings. The issue of \u0093new resources br ought to the society from outside, or discovered in the society itself\u0094 intensifies confli ct, as it ignites a battle for 37control over these imported or newly discovered primary resources (Unschuld, 1975:311). For example, while the biomedical profession disparaged acupuncture in the 1970s, by the turn of the century it had become a lucrative field and biomedical pra ctitioners increasingly administered it. In Belgium today, 74% of acupuncture treatment i s provided by biomedical doctors (WHO, 2002e:12). In his analysis of the relationship between acupunc ture and biomedicine in Britain, Saks concludes that professional self-in terest motivated both the initial rejection of acupuncture, and the later adoption of it by the biome dical profession (Saks, 1992b, 1995a). The focus on conflict over resources between practitioner groups aims to address an insufficiently documented aspect of efforts to integrate biome dical and TRM systems \u0096 that of \u0093economic and prestige competition between the two sectors\u0094 (Gr een, 1988:1126). Interest group competition based on preserving and controlling pri mary and secondary resources may be \u0093irrational\u0094 in outcomes in terms of healt h system development, if it requires co-operation (sharing resources) to improve delivery or s upply. As mentioned earlier, according to Unschuld\u0092s theory of medico-cultural c onflict, these two groups require close government supervision or coercion to co-operate, unles s they gain an advantage (secondary resource) from doing so.19 The \u0093blurring boundaries\u0094 between systems mentioned previously (some TRM practitioners adopting biomedical equipment, and some biomedical doctors prac tising \u0093integrative medicine\u0094 using CAM) can therefore be viewed as efforts to enc roach on each other\u0092s primary resource base. Their behaviour is rational in the sense of pre serving and extending their professional group economic and/or social benefits (secondary resources). However, the result of this competition is: In reality, the two systems are everywhere complementary from the point of view of those who experience them; yet nowhere does this complementarit y seem to develop into effective co-operation, integrated into a structure that acknowle dges the fundamental legitimacy of both systems (Kikhela, Bibeau, & Corin, 1981:96). 19 This may account for the success of integrating bi omedical and TRM systems in socialist and communist countries. McDonald notes they \u0093refuse to allow the b attles of professionals over the carving up of the medical arena to interfere with the delivery of health\u0094 (1981:106) . The biomedical profession has far less power and autonomy in socialist countries (Maclean, 1986:16). Elling (198 1) has explored links between socialist and capital ist countries, and the mixing of TRM and biomedical systems, and hyp othesised it was related to economic resources avai lable. However, his theory was not strictly borne out by deve lopments in the 1990s (for example, in capitalist-o riented societies, TRM/CAM was not used more by the working class). Availability and distribution of economic r esources is, however, an important factor as demonstrated by Elling in an analysis of relationships of power, st atus, wealth, and health care (see also 1978). He concludes that the actual configuration of medical systems is less relevant to the health status of populations than the control a nd distribution of resources in that society. 38Difficult and conflicted policy areas, like health systems deve lopment and planning, may therefore demonstrate competition between interest groups and subsequent \u0093irrational\u0094 outcomes on social or economic levels. While all stakeholders enga ge in the policy formulation process, this research focuses specifically on tw o interest groups \u0096 TRM/CAM and biomedical practitioners, because they have a critical relations hip in the policy formulation and implementation phase. These competing medical systems perpetually manoeuvre to simultaneously preserve and/or extend their primary and secondary resource bases, and one strategy for this is professionalisation. The multiple tensions and trade-offs in taking up strategies such a s professionalisation are explicitly described in the case of homoeopathy by Cant and Sharma (1995; 1996). According to Unschuld, how much of the stimulus that drives m edical/health system development is ultimately related to this need for increased con trol over and utilisation of resources for the benefit of the professional groups members rathe r than humanitarian goals is questionable (1975:310). 2.2.3 Lee\u0092s conceptual model for comparative studies of health c are systems While Unschuld\u0092s theory offers an interesting method to conce ptualise the interaction of medical systems, it neglects explaining or taking into account power differentials. Lee (1982) also analysed the dynamics between different medical system s, and his findings correlate with, and extend, Unschuld\u0092s theory. The conclusion s drawn by Lee also articulate recurrent themes subsequently established in medical anthrop ology and health policy literature, and this material has been incorporated into an a daptation of Lee\u0092s model. Lee considered the universal pattern of \u0093hierarchical pluralis m\u0094 which characterises the organisation of medical systems. He concluded that dominance ha d two dimensions \u0096 \u0093structural superiority \u0094 (control over health affairs, economic resources, power, status) and \u0093functional strength \u0094 (use and distribution in society) (Lee, 1982:630). For example, whereas biomedicine may be structurally dominant, TRM may be functi onally superior. Lee was interested specifically in how and why the functional and struc tural strengths of medical systems varied between societies and throughout history. An important component in the varying strengths of medical syste ms was the role of professional organisations, which help to legitimate medical knowle dge and contribute to gaining political and economic power (Lee, 1982:636). However, Lee noted t hat although TRM/CAM practitioners had recently begun to form professional associati ons, they had not 39managed to gain the same structural status as biomedicine (1982:37). The refore, the context of modernisation and the role of scientific discourse in this process were considered important (Lee, 1982:637). The central role accorded to scientific discourse in shapi ng power relations corresponds with the concepts of power and knowledge developed by Foucault. Gieryn (1983) ha s described the use of science in constructing boundaries between professions (se curing primary resources), and how this demarcation provides professional benefits (s econdary resources). This is also important to notions of modernisation where the role of expert systems of knowledge often based on science assume greater importance, and there is an ascendance of secular, materialist and rationalist values (Saks, 1998:199-200). Lee argues that Western science emerged as the dominant ideology in t he process of modernisation, and biomedicine attained credibility and stat us aligned with this (\u0093legal\u0096 rational authority\u0094). In that process, biomedicine achieved a le galised structural monopoly on formal health care (Kelner et al., 2004; Saks, 1998, 2003a) and was con sidered the only legitimate health care provider, or the \u0093official supplier a rol e it protects with diligence\u0094 (Waldram, 2000:618). This intimate relationship between science (t echnology), biomedicine, modernisation and the industrial capitalist state (Moran & Alexa nder, 1997) may have assisted what Kleinman observed as biomedicine outstripping its own professional autonomy and achieving a status that is inseparable from the modern state (1995: 39). Lee contends that modernisation via science and technology facilita tes the absorption of TRM into biomedicine, and that TRM systems have tended to embrace ra ther than resist this trend through professionalising and adopting scientific methods and ide ology (Lee, 1982:639). These two factors of professionalisation and use of scientif ic discourse (which form themes in the literature) therefore appear to play central r oles in determining the structural strengths of different medical systems. The process es of professionalisation and adoption or application of scientific discourse can be seen to have key roles in power and authority between competing medical systems. The approach of profe ssionalising and adopting or applying scientific discourse to seek and maintain stru ctural strength (state recognition) can be interpreted as methods to secure primary resour ces, in order to access or preserve secondary resources (economic benefits, prestige). In summary, the concepts proposed by Unschuld (1975; 1976b) and Lee (1982) of fer tools to conceptualise the interaction of medical systems. Differ ent medical systems (primary resource aggregates) are in competition and conflict with ea ch other to obtain secondary 40resources (wealth, power, status). Techniques used in this compet ition may include professionalisation (for example, formalised associations, s tandardised training, codified knowledge) and the application of scientific discourse. Use of the dual techniques of professionalisation and adoption of s cientific discourse has been noted in osteopathy (Baer, 1981; Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:544), homoeopa thy (Cant & Sharma, 1995, 1996; Lee, 1982; Taylor, 1979a:83), chiropractic (Coburn & Bigg s, 1986), acupuncture (Baer et al., 1998) and naturopathy (Gort & Coburn, 1988). Howeve r, this process appears to create unintended outcomes. Namely, the presumed be nefits (secondary resources) may not be fully obtained by the TRM/CAM group, auton omy and scope of their primary resources are threatened, and ultimate absorption and sub ordination within biomedicine can occur. This allows biomedicine to continue strength ening its structural status.20 Struggles between competing groups for structural strength (s econdary resources) therefore seems to manifest in recourse to professionalisation and the use of s cientific discourse, which serve to maintain and strengthen existing power relation s in formal health care systems. A form of \u0093hierarchical pluralism\u0094 is perpetuated, and t hey do not \u0093blend into a unified system of health care, despite the fact they claim to p erform similar functions (i.e. dealing with health and illness) for the society\u0094 (Lee, 1982:629). According to Lee, TRM/CAM adopting the processes of professionalisation and scientif ic ideology will simply facilitate biomedical absorption unless scientific discourse can be accommodated within their own theoretical frameworks, and state support obtained in t he formation of a centralised professional organisation (1982:640). He considers that the WHO promoting T RM could also accelerate this absorption process (Lee, 1982:639), therefore se rving to amplify biomedical structural strength. Although Lee made reference to other articles authored by Unsc huld, he appeared to be working in isolation from Unschuld\u0092s theory of medico-cultural conflict. These theories are complementary and can be synthesised. The relationship and \u0093jockeying for power and legitimation\u0094 between medical systems has been a subject e xplored by many medical anthropologists (Lock, 1990:41). However, it does not appear that common principles and conclusions between various theories and observations have bee n established or linked (such 20 An example is osteopathy, which adopted scientific discourse and subsequently received state support and was integrated into mainstream health care in the Unite d States (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:544). Homeopathy was also absorbed by a \u0093significant extent\u0094 into biomedicine after reforming theories, techniques and organisati on (Lee, 1982). Taylor notes that the \u0093progressive upgrading\u0094 of osteopathy and homeopathy led to a \u0093spontaneous synthesis\u0094 with biomedicine (1979a:83). See also Ba er (1981). 41as professionalisation and application of scientific discourse as te chniques in the competition for resources), and tested in policy and programme analysis on an i nternational and national level. The framework developed from consolidating these theories and themes intends to address this gap in the literature. 2.3 Linking the theories to explore the policy of integration An analytical framework to explore the evolution and implementa tion of the policy of integration of medical systems in formal health care has been cr eated, in this thesis, from a synthesis of anthropological and political science tools. The framework simplifies and generalises in order to try to clarify an otherwise bewildering top ic of enormous scope. This is necessary in order to have any chance of understanding complex p rocesses or situations, and is based on the premise that a smaller set of critical relation ships underlies such phenomena (Sabatier, 1999:4-5). It is proposed that interest group inter action (competition for resources) may partially explain the peculiar 25-year life- cycle of this policy on an international level, and its problematic transfer to national l evels. Kingdon\u0092s \u0093multiple stream\u0094 theory allows the economic, political and s ocial environment surrounding the policy of integration to be explored, and offers a pote ntial explanation as to how and why the policy agenda on integration was set. It provides a fra mework to consider how health issues are defined ( problems ), and how the solutions proposed to address them (policies ), are influenced by the surrounding context ( politics ). These streams coupled (linked) twice, when the issue of integrating TRM into national h ealth systems arose on the global health agenda \u0096 in 1978 and in 2002. Examining the policy documents at tho se points in time, and tracing the history of this policy and programme develop ment in the intervening years allows boundaries of debate, paradigm and power shifts to be ex plored, and the roles and motives of various actors and interest groups to be assessed. The politics (such as shifts in ideology, public opinion, interest group activity); a nd problems (problem recognition and identification) surrounding this policy at an in ternational level will be analysed. Emphasis is given to the politics stream (specifically interest group activity) using Unschuld\u0092s (1975, 1976) theory of medico-cultural conflict co mbined with Lee\u0092s conceptual model for the comparative study of health care systems ( Lee, 1982). The combination of the theories and frameworks mentioned allows this p olicy issue to be considered as an intrinsically political exercise that has bee n stimulated by global social and economic forces. 42 A critical relationship is focused on in this assessment \u0096 biomedic al and TRM practitioner groups, who operate as interest groups within both the politics and policy streams. These groups are motivated by a desire to maintain and increase access to primary and secondary resources, apart from their common goal of providing health care to the c ommunity. Tactics to preserve and increase access to resources include profess ionalisation and the use of scientific discourse. This synthesised framework for analysis ill uminates the conflict and competition for primary and secondary resources between medical s ystems (interest groups), and how this is reflected in policy content and programme formulatio n and implementation. For example, in the identification of problems, definition of health resources, methods proposed for integration, and allocation of financial resources. Key policy and programme documents and activities in relation to int egration can therefore be interpreted with the application of the \u0093resource model\u0094 (refle cting interest group motives to secure resources motivated by professional self-interest ). If this hypothesis is correct, policy content and programme development regarding integration wi ll reveal the manoeuvring and strategies of interest groups to influence the defini tion, legitimation and allocation of primary resources (knowledge, skills, techniques, drugs, technology, equipment and facilities) in order to preserve or extend access to seconda ry resources (material and non- material rewards). In doing so, the interest groups take advantag e of surrounding economic and social contexts to promote their political and professional in terests on the health care agenda. The concept of integration requires sharing economic and polit ical power (Chi, 1994:308), and a level of mutual respect between practitioners of diverse sy stems. However, if as Unschuld hypothesises, biomedical and traditional practitioners ( groups) compete to preserve exclusive access to and the integrity of their pri mary resources, and increase secondary resources (money, status and prestige) then the process wil l be extremely problematic and highly contested. As this thesis demonstrates, t he health policy of integration of TRM into health care systems is therefore not t echnical but political, and the outcomes can be interpreted to reflect power relations of interes t groups at organisational (e.g. WHO) or national levels. Table 3 offers an overview of how the synthesised \u0093resource model\u0094 ba sed primarily on Kingdon (1984) and Unschuld (1975; 1976b), but also drawing on Lee (1982), will be applied and tested to the policy issue of integration on a global level. It does not include broader social and economic trends, and ideological shifts, that a lso influenced policy 43development and implementation. The framework outlined in tabl e 3 is a generalised illustration to enable the policy issue and progress in its implem entation to be conceptualised. The table demonstrates how a window of opportunity opens in the problem and/or politics streams for a policy to be elevated on the agenda. It also demons trates how the problem identified can change in nature, while the policy solution propose d remains the same. In addition, the politics stream (specifically interest groups) can modify their positi on based on external circumstances \u0096 such as the development of economi c incentives for co- operation, or the rise of new public health problems. By 2002, public health and economic issues in the North also became relevant to the matter of integrati on, and all parties had a direct interest in resolving the formal role of TRM/CAM. 51 Table 3: Application of the theoretical framework to policy of integrati ng TRM to illustrate coupling\u0094 of problem and politics streams on global level WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION \u0096 policy domain: traditional medicine SOUTH NORTH Problem Politics (TRM) Policy Politics (Biomedicine) Problem 1970s (ch. 3) Biomedicine resource intensive (not feasible to extend coverage 100%), does not meet needs and has not replaced TRM; maternal and child mortality; communicable diseases Achieves formal recognition and therefore potential to acquire more resources (redistribution of secondary resources, formal recognition of their primary resource base) Integration of TRM via PHC to provide the South with basic health care services; linked to HFA goal (window opened in South) technical advantage in co-operation Not threatened as TRM sphere restricted to PHC and \u0093scientifically valid\u0094 practices; TRM seen as a method to extend the reach of limited biomedical services Recognition of cost and equity issues in biomedical service delivery 1980s (ch.4) Continued lack of biomedical manpower, drugs and infrastructure; AIDS, environmental degradation (need for preservation of primary resource base) Limited role in PHC means less status (biomedical auxiliaries), no increase in remuneration (secondary resources); rise in formation of professional bodies and professional activities (e.g. conferences, publications) PHC concept falters in implementation phase; biomedical/vertical approaches continue to dominate delivery (window closed) competition to secure resources TRM/CAM practices disparaged and criticised, dismissed as having no clinical validity.

These issues were mentioned in the introd uction and include questions regarding the requirements for successful transfers of health se ctor reform policies, the impact of international initiatives at country levels, the prac tical implications of these initiatives, and whether there is \u0093lesson drawing\u0094 on what works and for what reasons in health policy development. In addition to considering these general policy questions, the case study on the history and evolution of integration of TRM allows the development and testing of a potential explanatory framework, the application of which forms the body of th is thesis. This framework incorporates a macro (international) and micro (national) approach, and proposes that interest group activity is crucial in understanding the outcome s observed. The interest group activity is \u0093rational\u0094 as a form of group behaviour but serves to produce \u0093irrational\u0094 health policy outcomes in relation to the integration (formalisati on in health care systems) of TRM, and obstacles in the national level implementation of such a po licy. The politics (shifts in ideology, public opinion, interest group activity, administr ative changes); and problems (problem recognition and identification) surrounding this policy are investigated. Within this analysis, specific emphasis is given to evidence of professionalisation and the use of scientific discourse, to asses s whether and how these techniques (as proposed by Unschuld and Lee) are employed by interest groups in t he competition for primary and secondary resources, and the extent and me thod of their application. Policy and programme documents are therefore ex amined from the perspective of revealing underlying unarticulated values and ideologies (Hancock , 1999:47) that reflect power relations and conflict between competing medical system s. Shifts in the politics and problems streams (such as the influence of health transitions and new public health concerns, and changing or emerging economic and social fa ctors) and how this affected the role of TRM on the policy agenda, and the natur e of interaction between interest groups, will be considered. This is because such sh ifts may influence the preferences or validity of primary resources used, and the generation or alloca tion of secondary resources. For example, the increasing use of CAM in the Nort h and concurrent export of TRM from the South (\u0093new resources brought to the society from outside, or discovered in 46the society itself\u0094) is anticipated to result in intensified com petition and conflict between interest groups, as control and authority over these imported or newl y discovered resources is contested (Unschuld, 1975:311). The role of international organisations in the integration policy pr ocess is important in terms of both the broader questions raised by global health policy (such as glo bal \u0096 local policy transfer, the promotion and transmission of certain values, and the formulation and implementation of universal policy prescriptions) and also speci fically in relation to the relationship between TRM and biomedicine. Lee hypothesised tha t the WHO promoting TRM would accelerate the absorption process (Lee, 1982:639) therefore se rving to augment and intensify biomedical structural strength. Whether this has occ urred over the approximately 30 year period analysed, and how the WHO mediated and guided health system integration policy and programme development, is conside red. The thesis does not follow a conventional format, such as presenting a li terature review followed by methodology, data presentation and research analysis a nd findings. This is partly due to the volume of material, and also the inability to sepa rate out the literature from the research findings. Part of the literature review has al ready been presented in the introduction and methodology chapters, and the literature is used throughout the body of the thesis to interpret and assess interest group interaction. In t his way, the literature review and research analysis and findings are inevitably bound together. Each of the following chapters presents the results of assessment of the literature, using the methodology already outlined to construct the findings. This synthes ised framework is used as the \u0093prism\u0094 through which the data is presented, in order to illustrate its application to the policy issue. The policy and programme documentation and data is an alysed and structured in terms of how it relates to, defines or restricts the primary and secondary resources of biomedicine and TRM. This is indicated where necessary to provide gu idance on the application of the theories, and the terminology of primary/seconda ry resources is used throughout. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first par t explores the global evolution of the policy on integration (chapters 3-6), and the second part explore s the transfer and application of this policy on a national level (chapter 7). The conclusi on is contained in chapter 8. 472.4.1 Part 1: global level The first part of the thesis is a chronological narrative of the develo pment and progress of the WHO policy on TRM between the 1970s and 2002. This aims to illustrate and explain how the WHO policy on TRM (content and application) was influenced by the sur rounding political, economic and health policy environment. The changing natur e and agenda of actors (WHO, World Bank, interest groups) is traced; shifting influence s of power and boundaries of health policy debate considered; and broader social and economic fa ctors that form the backdrop to these changes are discussed. This investigation offers insights into the issues that influence agenda setting and policy currency in the health ar ena on an international level. Journal articles, books, reports and resolutions of the WHO, and c onference proceedings are the main sources of information. A timeline was constructed of all identified WHO activity in relation to TRM, listing resolutions, reports, documents and confe rences or meetings. This list is contained in appendix 1 (page 348). The two key documents were i dentified as the initial WHO technical report on TRM (WHO, 1978b) and the WHO glob al strategy on traditional medicine (WHO, 2002e). As the policy directives from the WHO headquarters in relation to TRM, these two documents loosely delineated the researc h boundaries. The international level analysis is divided into decade sections (one chapter for each decade), although it is acknowledged that these sections are \u0093artificial\u0094 in the sense that there is often no discrete demarcations delineating trends and ideological shifts. Ho wever, prominent themes and issues that emerged in those decades are discussed in r elation to their influence and role on the policy of integration of TRM. Chapter 3: 1970s \u0096 international recognition of TRM : an upsurge of nationalistic sentiment and biomedical primary resource pressures in the South combined to gi ve impetus to TRM on the international health agenda. With China providing an inspir ing model, the goal of \u0093Health For All\u0094 (as advocated by the WHO) was to be achieved using TR M primary resources. Chapter 4: 1980s \u0096 difficulty transferring policy to national l evels : a neo-liberal economic environment and global recession led to a contraction of health serv ices and hindered the implementation of new public health initiatives. Integration o f TRM floundered in national level adoption, and was submerged internationally in a policy vacu um. 48Chapter 5: 1990s \u0096 conducive condi tions develop for pushing TRM back onto the global agenda, as TRM was exported worldwide and became a multi-billi on dollar industry. This generation of secondary resources (economic benefits, growing status a nd prestige) led to stakeholders competing to secure resource bases and a renewed poli cy interest in TRM. Each chapter is structured in a similar manner. Firstly, the broa der policy context is described, both generally and then specifically in relation to the he alth field. The activities of the WHO and World Bank are then explored, in relation to TRM. The la st section considers responses in the policy stream (actors such as academics, policy and programme advisors, interest groups) and national level activity. The chapter structur e is therefore layered from the broader and more general policy context to the specific micro level policy context: Section 1 . General global events and policy trends; health policy trends Section 2 . International agencies - WHO, World Bank Section 3 . Responses in policy stream to integration of TRM (academics, interest groups); national level implementation and policy in relation to TR M This structure aims to demonstrate how broader policy trends affec t the scope of health field debate, which influences agencies responsible for health policy ar ticulation and implementation (WHO, World Bank). These influences are al so discernible in discussion, debate and activity in the policy stream on national levels. How problems are framed, and how actors (both international bodies and interest groups on nationa l levels) respond to those problems must therefore be placed in the context of broader policy tr ends. There is a complex inter-relationship between these levels of policy activi ty, and the threads which link them can be illustrated through looking in detail at one policy field \u0096 in this case, integration of TRM. Underlying this is a competition for resources between heal th professions, who must operate within the fluctuating policy context to secure thei r place (role in the health care system) on the agenda. While much of the material from the broader policy context a nd international agencies will be familiar to those with a background in health policy and medic al sociology, it is presented here in an effort to recast the perspective on the relationship betwee n medical/health care systems and more clearly establish the context within whi ch they are interacting. While they are providers of health care, in this research they are focussed on a s agents (interest groups; competing discourses) operating within the broader political, ec onomic and social milieu to secure resources. In that sense, the issue has been framed from a political science/policy 49theory perspective, rather than as a technical \u0093health care\u0094 provi sion question or anthropological issue per se. The final chapter on the global level (chapter 6) specifica lly analyses the TRM Strategy 2002-2005 (WHO, 2002e). This milestone document is considered in a separate chap ter due to its significance in articulating the WHO stance on TRM, and as th e final outcome of the policy process over several decades. It is also enables the previous chap ters to be structured in a similar manner, and kept within their chronological boundaries. 2.4.2 Part 2: national level In the second part of the thesis a national level study of Sri Lanka, using the same theoretical framework, is undertaken to consider transfer of the concept of i ntegration from the global to a national level. This aims to demonstrate that the framework can b e applied on global or national levels, and to explore the issues raised by global policy formulation and transfer in detail. The national level study focuses on the implementation of \u0093integra tion\u0094 through exploring the current situation and relationship between TRM and biomedical s ystems in Sri Lanka. Legislation, resource allocation, programme development, prof essional organisations, education, and current patterns of usage will be assessed. Th is analyses the impact that the international consensus on integration has had on a national level, and how it has been implemented and interpreted by the government and interest groups . Chapter 7: Sri Lanka : The role of Ayurvedic medicine in the health care system will b e the focus. This is a form of traditional medicine that originate d in India and has been used in Sri Lanka (with some local variations) for thousands of years. Sri La nka was chosen as a case study as it has a strong history and tradition of TRM use, was conside red in the initial WHO technical report on TRM (WHO, 1978b), and because previous research on TR M undertaken in India and Nepal enabled an understanding of local TRM systems us ed (specifically Ayurveda). Sri Lanka is considered an \u0093interesting laboratory\u0094 to examine pluralistic medical systems, as Ayurveda and biomedicine formally coexist (W axler-Morrison, 1988:531). Field work was undertaken in March and April (2003) and October, N ovember and December (2004). The empirical data used in the national case s tudy analysis consisted of primary and secondary resources as detailed below. 50a) Primary sources consist of semi-structured interviews and m aterial gathered from conferences and seminars. Two main groups of people were intervie wed. The first are bureaucrats and government employees working in an administrative ro le (such as programme and policy officers) in the relevant government departments . The focus of the interviews related to programme development and implementati on (such as general history, constraints and obstacles, resource allocation, focus of act ivity, catalysts for expansion or contraction of programmes, roles of external agencies). The second group are practitioners of traditional medicine and biomedic ine, and the focus is the relationship between these groups (such as professional co llaboration and referral patterns, attitudes to and extent of interaction between m edical systems, education and training, response to government initiatives). These participants we re met at conferences or at seminars (detailed below) or recruited via snowball sampling. Data was analysed for the identification of any themes and issues related to the theoret ical framework. The process for identifying and locating people for interviews was extremely difficult and time consuming. Initially, people in government departments or age ncies, or practitioners in private practice, were approached via \u0093cold calling\u0094. A fortuito us breakthrough in this process came when a key informant was located, a TRM practiti oner who held a senior government policy position and was also active in programme developmen t \u0096 Dr. Danister Perera. Dr. Perera was interviewed multiple times and ena bled access to be gained to other senior bureaucrats. He also helped gather policy and programme documents in English, and served as a reliable source for checking facts. A total of twenty formal interviews were conducted, with the aim of obtaining an equal and balanced sample from both biomedical and TRM systems, as well as representatives from government agencies, professional bodies and educational instituti ons. A list of the people interviewed and their positions is at appendix 2 (page 354). The interv iews were semi- structured and open ended and were not taped. This was because tapi ng the interviews appeared to formalise the process to the extent that people being int erviewed may have felt inhibited, and also because of the political sensitivity of some of t he issues discussed. Detailed notes were taken, based on questions that were framed t o explore those issues mentioned above \u0096 the extent and nature of interaction between medic al systems and how this was expressed in policy and programme development. The interviews were tailored according to the position of the per son, their English proficiency and time available. Common themes were used as prompt s, such as the level and 51appropriateness of government support for TRM, whether there were divergences between policy statements and actual programme implementation, the role of TRM in the formal health care system, difficulties in integration, attitudes an d referral patterns between practitioners, WHO activities, and if national policy activity was changing with increasing foreign interest in TRM. The interviews were allowed to spon taneously develop rather than being rigidly pre-determined to allow for the potential of previously unknown or unrecognised issues to emerge, and to prevent possible bias in the s tructure of interviews skewing data collection. While it would have been preferable to conduct more interviews o f both practitioners and bureaucrats (or to conduct multiple interviews), time limitati ons of participants and the difficulties in locating suitable informants constrained the s ample size. However, the specialised nature of the issue meant that relevant people to i nterview (the \u0093policy community\u0094) was also naturally restricted. At the end of the fi eld work, no noticeable new themes were emerging from the interviews. It may have also been i nteresting to conduct interviews with a broader sample (for example, with students of th ese medical systems, or with patients) but this was not strictly necessary for the purposes of t his research. Various conferences and seminars were attended, which were chosen acc ording to their relevance to the research issue. These were identified thr ough newspaper publicity or by invitation by Dr. Danister Perera (to those events that were not public). The English language paper was read daily to source relevant articles, as well as to locate any activities such as seminars or conferences that offered opportunities to gather information or identify people to interview. The activities attended were very valuable i n obtaining an understanding of the current climate in the relationship between medical systems , difficulties and tensions in the interaction of these medical systems in formal health ca re delivery, and the operation of programmes. The specific meetings and conferences attended w ere: Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science Meeting; Hon. Bernard Soysa Memorial Oration \u0096 Dr. ROB Wijesekera Traditional Pharmacopoeias and Modern Therapy , 25 March 2003 Sri Lanka Medical Association Conference; 116th Anniversary Academic Sessions Spiritual Health \u0096 A New Dimension in Health , 26-29 March 2003 Training session for community health workers, National Instit ute for Traditional Medicine; 24 October 2004 Medicina Alternativa Congress on Integrated Medicine , 27-30 Nov 2004 52 Workshop on the formulation of national policy on indigenous medic ine, National Institute for Traditional Medicine, 9 December 2004 Registration of TRM practitioners, Pallekele Ayurvedic Hospital, K andy, 13-14 December 2004 b) Secondary sources include policy and programme documents from the Sri Lankan Government, the World Bank and the WHO. Government policy statements , programme information, health plans, legislation, newspaper and journal a rticles, conference and seminar papers, and books were collected. Some of these docum ents were unpublished or confidential (\u0093grey literature\u0094) that were obtained from i nterview participants. Permission was obtained to access the WHO and the Sri Lankan Medical Associat ion libraries in Colombo. Physical searches of these libraries were undertaken to assess the representation of literature on TRM, and to obtain general information on the health poli cy domain in the Sri Lankan context. All major bookshops in Colombo were also canvas sed for relevant material. To explore the relationship between biomedicine and TRM, journals from t he biomedical and Ayurvedic profession were analysed. These journals offered an insight into professional attitudes and extent and history of interaction between medical sys tems. The Ceylon Medical Journal (the local version of the British Medical Journal, published in English) represents the biomedical profession, and all issues from 1990-2004 were manually ass essed for articles of relevance, and any reference to indigenous medicine. Hundreds of arti cles were available from this source, but only a few of these articles made specific reference to traditional medicine. The corresponding journal for the Ayurvedic profession is Ayurveda Sameekshawa , and all issues from inception (1983) to 2004 were similarly assessed. Unfortunat ely, only articles in English could be considered which reduced the available materia l from Ayurveda Sameekshawa . The parameters for collecting the information from professional jour nals were therefore imposed by physical constraints \u0096 all issues that coul d be accessed of the Ceylon Medical Journal were, these were shelved in the Sri Lankan Medical Association Libr ary and no copies prior to 1990 were available. Si milarly, the index of all issues of Ayurveda Sameekshawa from its inception in 1983 revealed about 100 articles in English, but many of these were about specific TRM remedies and treatments. On ly about a dozen articles over that time frame specifically related to the relationship or intera ction between biomedicine and TRM, or the role of TRM in health care. 53While locating documentation in English was problematic, the paucity of data on integration and the formal role of TRM in the health care system was revealing i n itself. It should be noted that the lack of available data related to health care policy and planning in general and not exclusively in relation to TRM. The gathering of literatu re and data thus only stopped when avenues for locating secondary sources appeared to have been e xhausted. Over the course of the field work, a comprehensive selection of material wa s obtained from a wide variety of sources and this information enabled consideratio n of the issues in detail at the national level. The findings of this research are contained in the case study of Sri Lanka (chapter 7). 2.4.3 Conclusion The final chapter of the body of the thesis (chapter 8) contains the conc lusions. Conclusions are drawn about various aspects of the field of inquiry, firstly drawing fi ndings about the main research question of why this issue first arose on the intern ational policy agenda in the 1970s, why it seemed to languish and prove very difficult to impleme nt on national levels in the 1980s, and why it was regenerated in the 1990s to reappear on the glob al health policy agenda in 2002. The appropriateness and utility of the explanatory m odel in answering this question is summarised and discussed. Conclusions about the supplementary global health policy questions a re also considered. These are the broader questions raised by researchers in relation t o health policy and globalisation, mentioned in the introductory chapter. The ques tions include the appropriateness of universal policy models that are driven by \u0093to p-down\u0094 approaches, the forces behind convergence of policy proposals, the processes and outc omes of the transfer of global health sector reform policies, whether there is \u0093lesson draw ing\u0094 on what works and for what reasons in health policy development, and whether cert ain values are promoted and transmitted globally through international organisations . Finally, implications for theory, implications for policy and practise, and implications for fut ure research are covered. 543. 1970s: International recognition of traditional medicine For far too long, traditional systems of medicine and \u0093modern\u0094 medicine have gone their separate ways in mutual antipathy. Yet are not their goals identical - to improve the health of mankind and thereby the quality of life? (Mahler, 1977) Director-General of WHO In the 1970s, fertile ground developed for elevating TRM on the policy a genda. This decade can be viewed as one where TRM systems of health exploited opport unities to challenge the authority of biomedicine and its pre-eminent position in health c are. The primary resource base of TRM was asserted, contesting the status of biomedicine and i ts sole claim to secondary resources (material and non-material rewards). This ch apter outlines how the policy environment on an international level became favourable to the co ncept of TRM, and how this was mediated by the WHO. Despite both TRM and biomedicine sharin g the common goal of improving health, they are perceived as professional co mpetitors motivated by the need to secure and maintain access to resources. During the 1970s, the WHO formally recognised the valuable role that tr aditional medicine played in health care services, and the potential to employ i t in a more systematic way. The TRM Programme was established in 1978, following a series of rel ated resolutions. TRM was also a component of other progressive schemes, launched around the same time. These were the essential drugs list (1977), and the ambitious global health goal \u0096 Health for All by the Year 2000 (1975), to be achieved using Primary Health Care (1978). The values of the Health For All goal (HFA), and the Primary Heal th Care (PHC) approach, were clearly stated in the joint WHO/UNICEF declaration made in Alma Ata, in 1978. It was revolutionary in both its language and implications. It called f or \u0093urgent action by all governments\u0094 to address the \u0093existing gross inequality in the health status of the people [that] is politically, socially and economically unacceptable\u0094 . The means to achieve this included more effectively utilising all resources available , such as reallocating money currently spent on armaments and military conflicts. This approach was a contentious departure for the WHO, which had previ ously restricted its activities to technical, disease specific (vertical) intervent ions. Despite the far-reaching concepts it endorsed, 60 international organisations and 138 member nati ons represented at 55the conference unanimously approved it. Very few concepts or proposals in t he health care arena have attained the same level of collective approval (Mull, 1990: 32). These countries and organisations had diverse backgrounds, with widely divergent p olitical and economic conditions, yet found accord on what could be considered a very radica l proposal. The ideas and language contained in the HFA resolution and the PHC commitment ( known as the Alma Ata Declaration), reflect economic, political and social trends prominent in that era. Today, the utopian concepts it endorses seem overly idealis tic and it has become a renowned landmark in the history of the WHO. The commitment to a chieving this humanitarian goal, and even the understanding by signatories of the concept, has been questioned (Macdonald, 1992:55; Werner, 1995). Officially sanctioning an d encouraging the use of traditional medicine was not met with the same approval as the PHC concept (Bichmann, 1979:177), and was considered by some a and the re sult of \u0093emotional self-indulgence\u0094 (Velimirovic, 1984b:74). While the goal of HFA was laudable, the proposed methods to achieve it (PHC, Essential Drugs and using TRM) have been hotly contested and achieved variable d egrees of success in implementation. Viewed in the broader context of popular sentime nts and ideological shifts of the decade, they appear logical solutions to the serious ine quities in health status. Nevertheless, as will be demonstrated, they are not simply technic al and administrative concepts but have inherently political and economic consequences. The environment that produced the Alma Ata Declaration and the associated scheme s is initially considered, followed by more specific trends in the health field. The conten t of resolutions, programs and policy documents of the WHO in relation to TRM are then asse ssed, in the context of revealing a battle for control over and access to resources. This ba ttle took place against the backdrop of the broader policy context. Section 1: policy context 3.1 The broader policy context In the 1970s, the optimism of the prosperous \u0093development decade\u0094 that pr eceded it was replaced with a critical assessment of the current global soc ial and economic situation, and a reappraisal of what boded for the future. Assumptions underlying developm ent discourses were questioned, with the sobering realisations that poverty, ill -health and lack of access to basic services remained and even increased, despite economic g rowth. The benefits of 56industrialisation, modernisation, scientific and technologic al advances did not \u0093trickle down\u0094 through the population, as had first been anticipated. These unanticipated impacts led to the appropriateness of West ern concepts and models of modernisation and industrialisation being widely questioned. \u0093De pendency theory\u0094 argued that transferring technology, values and resources to the South woul d not result in the same development paths that had occurred in the North. Instead, existi ng global power relations resulted in contradictory trends and continued underdevelopme nt. The imbalances of economic and political power had to be taken into account. This theo ry emerged from scholars in the South (Latin America) and was a marked deviatio n from simplistic and ethnocentric modernisation premises, which had previously guided development efforts (Evans, see also Faletto & Cardoso, 1979; Ibister, 1995; Palma, 1978). The supposed panacea of economic growth and modernisation as a solut ion to many social problems was replaced with a more critical examination of insti tutions, entrenched interests and the distribution of resources within historical and social fr ameworks. Whether economic growth as an end in itself was desirable, and how to balance this wi th social needs was also questioned (Schumacher, 1973; Seers & Joy, 1971). This was undertaken in an environment where the limits to resources available became an over-riding c oncern. It was recognised there were limits to economic growth, to the benefits of such growth an d the resources available to support continued expansion. 3.1.1 Limited resources The oil shock in 1973 was a catalyst for the recognition of the finite exis tence of natural resources. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (O PEC) quadrupled the price of oil, which again doubled in price before the decade was out. Th e 500% increase in the price of a commodity (that did not have substitutes) ended the inexpensi ve access to energy that had fuelled rapid industrialisation, and the confident belief th at such growth would be unimpeded. The oil crisis meant that governments and international agencies realised that continued growth relied upon natural resource management (Sachs, 1993:9). It also had flow on social and economic effects, such as inflation and price incr eases for imported goods as well as basic commodities. Rapid population growth and the subsequent demand on resources remained a c ause for concern, continuing a trend that had gained international atten tion in the 1960s. It seemed that the questionable progress made with development could not kee p pace with population 57growth, which threatened to outstrip the supply of goods and service s, including basic necessities like food and water. India and China introduced dracon ian measures to curtail the population explosion \u0096 forced sterilisation (1975-76) and one-child policies (1978) respectively. Food shortages magnified the crisis scenario that was developing. In the early 1970s, poor harvests and drought in Africa resulted in famine and wides pread malnutrition. There was a growing sense of scarcity, environmental fragility, economic vulnerability and a need to seek alternatives to meet the basic needs of humanity. A conve ntion on the international trade of endangered species (CITES) was agreed and became operational in 1975. A series of international UN sponsored conferences reflect t he prominent concerns with resources and the environment: human environment (1972), food , population, as well as a special session of the General Assembly to discuss resource issue s (1974), water, and desertification (1977). All these conferences reflect the themes of limited resources, population growth and resource balance and meeting basic needs. 3.1.2 Human rights and equal opportunity Throughout the decade, the rights of minority groups to access services , and be recognised as contributing to and benefiting from development efforts also came to the fore. The economic and social exploitation of women, ethnic groups, the poor or less educat ed was exposed and their rights championed, building on and institutionalising an impetus th at had commenced in the 1960s. Rawls (1971) produced an influential account of social jus tice; and racism, sexism and human rights became a matter of civil concern, both on nati onal and international levels. The UN held conferences on women (1975), followed by a Convention on the E limination of Discrimination Against Women (1979) and declared an International Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. The Helsinki Accords of 1972 and 1975 w ere an international recognition of and commitment to human rights iss ues. This atmosphere established the scene for health as a basic human right, and the nee d to improve the dire health status of those in the South (the less privileged), to be affirm ed in Alma Ata in 1978. At the same time, there was growing public disquiet about involvemen t in armed conflicts and the arms race, with calls for restraint on both humanitarian and e conomic grounds. A turning point was the 1973 withdrawal of US forces from Vietnam, aft er a long and costly engagement. This war, the longest the US had fought and first it ha d lost, seemed to symbolise the futility of conflict, limits to Western technology, an d the unlimited resources 58war could absorb (see Lake, 1993). Using resources more constructive ly for positive ends (such as health and education) became a moral concern, as ex pressed in the Alma Ata declaration. According to Bello (1994:9), the decisive victory of Vietn am over the United States and OPEC success in oil price control (discussed below) meant that the South felt on the threshold of a new political and economic era. 3.1.3 Shifting economic and political power On a global level, newly independent countries began to flex political and economic muscle. Asserting their power after decades of colonisation, and buoyed by the succes s of OPEC reclaiming price control over its natural resources, these count ries demanded a new international economic order (NIEO). OPEC was significant in that it represented many previously politically and economically \u0093powerless\u0094 countries. Uniting allowed them to control the agenda of an important global issue and increase thei r national share of economic benefits (in direct opposition to Western oil corporations and the ir monopoly on prices). Other developing nations tried to follow suit, and create price contr ol on minerals and agricultural commodities (Bello, 1994:9). Following from the example of OPEC, at the UN special session of the General Assembly in 1974 developing countries grouped together to present their demands, w hich became known as the new international economic order (NIEO). In general, the developing nations sought special recognition of their circumstances in economic affairs , to provide them with access to markets and an increase in resource transfers. This was a high ly symbolic and important event, although did not succeed for a variety of reasons and became considered a \u0093classic illustration of failed international reform\u0094 (Rothstein, 1993:629) . This economic movement corresponded with a surge in membership of United Nations bodies including the WHO, which shifted the balance of power in the Organisation to the South and all owed it to influence the agenda of the World Health Assembly and refocu s priorities away from the industrialised nations. The HFA and PHC movements of the same era could also be grouped wit h the failed NIEO initiative. They sought a \u0093new health order\u0094, and a redistrib ution of resources to meet the needs of the poorest and least powerful segments of society. Whil e the NIEO sought North- South economic redistribution, the HFA and PHC (basic needs) initia tives sought national redistribution from tertiary (curative) to primary (preventative ) health. The NIEO, HFA and PHC initiatives all reflected concern over resources and access to r esources, and sought 59concessions in the name of human rights, social justice and equ ity (see Cohen & Purcal, 1989:8). These idealistic international commitments were feature s of a global wave of moral concern, leading to the establishment of goals that were noble but not pragmati c. While the member states of the WHO pledged in 1975 to achieve health for all by the year 2000, the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (1976) pledged to have safe w ater for all by 1990, and the 1974 World Food conference assured that \u0093within a decade no ch ild would go to bed hungry, that no family would fear for its next days bread, and that no human being\u0092s future capabilities would be stunted by malnutrition.\u0094 While achi eving consensus on these ideals was not difficult, translating the rhetoric into realit y proved far more problematic. 3.2 Trends in the health field The broader trends and concerns of the tumultuous 1970s are reflected in t he content and scope of WHO initiatives, as well as in specific ideological devel opments within the health field.21 Issues such as the limits to biomedical technology and its resource int ensive nature; inequitable service delivery; and the failings of the western biomed ical models emerged. These growing concerns worked to undermine the authority of the biomedic al primary resource base (drugs, techniques, knowledge) and question the previous ly uncontested power and authority of the biomedical profession within the health care sys tem. The stark North-South disparities in heath status, and conti nued health inequities even within wealthier nations, pointed to structural faults in existing syste ms that had failed to meet their promises. Health as a basic human right was re-asserted, with the conditions required in achieving and maintaining it considered an associated pre requisite. The need to reassess and reorient previous strategies to find alternative ways to meet t he basic health needs of populations became paramount. 21 Two books offer a comprehensive collection of major authors, articles and concerns that emerged in the 1970s: \u0093Health and Disease \u0096 A Reader\u0094 (Black et al., 1984 ) and \u0093The Cultural Crisis of Modern Medicine\u0094 (Eh renreich, 1978). 603.2.1 Limits to biomedicine Major contributors to the shift in the perception of the role of biom edicine in public health were Cochrane (1972), Illich (1975) and McKeown (1976; 1979). They built on the cruc ial assessments and themes raised by Dubos (1959). Cochrane critically c onsidered the assumption that biomedicine was necessarily effective or efficie nt. He worked to eliminate bias in assessing its validity, and promoted the rational use of resour ces by using the most effective treatment at lowest cost. His work was the result of cari ng for prisoners of war where he successfully treated many people despite having almost no bi omedical pharmaceuticals (Black et al., 1984:104). McKeown questioned the significance of the biomedical contributi on to improvements in population health. He demonstrated that other factors such as improved nu trition, water, sanitation and smaller family size were more important to t he progress made in health indices that had occurred throughout the century. The assumption tha t hospitals and pharmacies, vaccinations and development of biomedical theory and education caused the rapid decline in mortality was exposed as erroneous. This false conclusion was the result of the \u0093failure to distinguish clearly between the interests of the doctor and the interests of the patient \u0094 which he considered \u0093a common error in the interpretation of medical history\u0094 (McKeown, 1984:107, emphasis added). Unlike Cochrane and McKeown, Illich was not a biomedical doctor and w as even more critical in his approach, arguing that the medical profession i tself and medical technology were threats to health (iatrogenesis). Medical Nemesis \u0096 the Expropriation of Health (Illich, 1975) was a landmark critique broadly condemning industrial society an d its impact on health and well being, as well as the biomedical monopoly that rem oved the power from individuals to treat and heal themselves. According to this perce ption, \u0093medicine has become a source of harm and oppression rather than a vehicle of relie f and liberation\u0094 (Navarro, 1976:xi). Illich proposed the \u0093de-professionalisation\u0094 of biomedicine \u0096 rem oving and reducing the control of experts over medical knowledge (primary resourc es) and increasing the autonomy of the individual to choose and manage their health care. Illich (1975) raised many issues that were formative in the devel opment of critical discourses on biomedicine and health care services, such as the ineffe ctiveness of biomedical treatments, the inordinate cost of biomedical equipment, the com modification of health care and \u0093medicalisation\u0094 of society. The role of the environment, incl uding food, housing, and working conditions were stressed as important in determining health s tatus. His presentation 61was persuasive, although his conclusions were extreme; critici sed even by other radical commentators (Doyal, 1979:17-20; Navarro, 1976:104-128). The themes of limits to, and dangers of an uncritical acceptan ce of biomedicine (science and technology), are reflected in many other texts of that period. For exa mple, in books with titles such as The Cultural Crisis of Modern Medicine (Ehrenreich, 1978), The Magic Bullet: Social Implications and Limitations of Modern Medicine, an Environmental Approach (Diesendorf, 1976), The Drugging of the Americas (Silverman, 1976) and Medicine out of Control: Anatomy of a Malignant Technology (Taylor, 1979b). Addictions to and dependency on drugs, the side effects and implications of commonly pres cribed biomedical treatments, and the benefits of this approach for the individual and s ociety were considered. In 1978, the Office of Technology Assessment in the United States revi ewed the safety and efficacy of biomedical technologies, and concluded that evidence of the ir benefits was often minimal. It quoted research findings that only 10-20% of all procedures used in biomedical practice had been clinically proven as beneficial (OTA, 1978:94), a so bering conclusion also recognised by Salmon, 1980b; Elling, 1981b; Unschuld, 1976b). 3.1.2 Biomedicine, equity and social justice The links between biomedical, economic and social systems, and t he ways that these perpetuated and reinforced inequalities, were explored by many sc holars throughout the decade, such as Navarro (1976), Doyal (1979), Fanon (1967; 1978) and Paul (1978). The political economy approach linked capitalism, colonialism and imperi alism with an unequal distribution of biomedical health resources, and a profit-orient ation that denied access to the poor and marginalised. The nature of capitalism itself played a role in the poor health of segments of the population, and the relationship between the pharmaceuti cal industry, the biomedical profession and the growing commodification of health were cr itiqued. The health system was inherently skewed in distribution as biomed ical professionals gravitated to urban areas where their access to secondary reso urces (material and non- material rewards) was greatest (Maynard, 1977). Likewise, in the South, trained health care professionals immigrated to the North to secure professional be nefits (Gish & Godfrey, 1979). This problem of inadequate biomedical manpower and in rural o r poorer areas could not be addressed by simply increasing the number of doctors or the number of government positions, as this did not modify the preferences of doctors who we re motivated by financial gain and status (secondary resources) (Good et al., 1979:147; Sathy amala, Su ndharam, & Bhanot, 1986:26). In 1975 it was estimated that in the South, less than 15% of r ural and 62underprivileged populations had access to biomedical health services ( McDonald, 1981:101).22 Freidson critically explored biomedical professional monopoly a nd dominance, and health care systems skewed to provider self interests (Frei dson, 1970a, 1970b). Beyond the distribution and effectiveness of biomedical services, soci al and cultural critiques analysed biomedicine as a form of social control. The nature and impact of biomedical discourse in areas such as mental health, obstetrics a nd gynaecology, race, and class were explored (Ehrenreich & Ehrenreich, 1978; Zola, 1978). Th e expanding sphere of biomedical control through \u0093medicalisation\u0094 and its perpetuat ion of racist, sexist and oppressive ideologies were analysed, in contrast to biomedicine bei ng perceived as a benign, altruistic and objective profession. The issues of equity and jus tice, and structural faults of biomedical models of health care became the focus of a journal laun ched by Navarro in 1971, The International Journal of Health Services . A body of work developed by Foucault (1973; 1975; 1977; 1979) informed this process. Foucault emphasised that discourse and knowledge operates within institutional and social environments, and was a medium through which power, domination and cont rol could be expressed. Foucault demonstrated that biomedicine's assumed linea r evolution of a greater objectivity and understanding through the application of science a nd technology was misleading. Instead the \u0093medical gaze\u0094 constructs and transf orms perceptions of disease and illness according to subjective criteria, and serves to maintai n the hierarchical authority of the biomedical profession.23 3.1.3 Shifting emphasis of health care The growing awareness that health status and distribution of dis ease were related to complex socio-economic factors meant that technical, curative interv entions were increasingly considered ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of populations. In the North, the burden of disease was shifting to chronic conditions (cancer, heart di sease, stroke) that biomedicine was unable to cure or prevent (Jones & Moon, 1987:19-20). In the Sout h, infectious and preventable conditions (diarrhoea, malnutrition, m alaria) were still causing 22 In contrast, TRM practitioners outnumbered biomedic al health professionals by many hundreds or even thousands to one. For example, in a table on health manpower in Nepal, if the scale was kept constant, the bar representing faith healers would be nearly 20 feet long while that for biomedical doctors would be les s than 1 cm (Shrestha & Lediard, 1980:7). In sub-saharan Africa , TRM practitioners outnumber biomedical practitione rs by 100:1 and in Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia the ratio of pra ctitioners to population is 1:200-1:400 for TRM, an d 1:20 000 or less for biomedicine (WHO, 2002e:12). 23 This perspective supports Lee\u0092s (1982) contention that scientific discourse is an important factor in maintaining biomedical structural status in health systems, and has been combined with Unschuld\u0092s theory (1975) as a n explanatory tool (as described in the theory and meth odology section). 63high mortality rates; conditions that did not require expensive biom edical technology to treat. Prevention, education and public health measures were increasingl y viewed as having more important roles to play. The increasing acknowledgement of the limits to biomedical effective ness highlighted the excessive financial resources it absorbed, and the limited healt h benefits obtained relative to cost. Morley expressed this discrepancy as \u0093three quarters of the deaths are caused by conditions that can be prevented at low cost, but three quarters of the medical budget is spent on curative services\u0094 (in Good et al., 1979:147). Just as the \u0093Gre en Revolution\u0094 had failed to achieve food self-sufficiency, because it was a techn ical solution to essentially socio-economic problems (Doyal, 1979:130); the merits of the biomedical model of health care were being questioned on the same grounds. The biomedical paradi gm itself, based on physical reductionism, prevented consideration of social, emot ional and economic factors that influenced health and the effective treatment of comp lex, chronic illnesses. The biomedical model of health presented an inherent obstacle to incl usive health care (Macdonald, 1992:30-53), a factor noted by Engel in his promotion of a bio-psycho-social model of health care (Engel, 1977). Throughout this decade, some countries experimented with imple menting comprehensive and basic health services, rather than attempting to expand te rtiary biomedical infrastructure. These efforts were made partly on cost considerations, and part ly due to recognition that biomedical primary resources were inadequate to meet the health nee ds of populations. This was combined with a commitment to equity and meeting basic nee ds. Kenya, Indonesia, the Philippines, Tanzania, Vietnam, Cuba, Nicaragua and China all p rovided examples of shifting the emphasis of health care from curative to preventative services, established at community levels. Good et al (1979:152) considered that \u0093the dualistic and dichotomized health care systems of the developing world seem ripe for modifi cation and mutual adjustment, especially given the dire scarcity of economic res ources\u0094 and that continuing to ignore TRM in health planning would be a disservice to those population s. Within this environment, the WHO was also undergoing fundamental transformations and T RM emerged as a viable health care resource. 64Section 2: international bodies 3.3 The WHO activities Under the leadership of Mahler (1973-1988), the WHO spearheaded the advocacy of a radical new direction in health services. Dr Mahler personified the sentiments of the era. He was a biomedical doctor who had worked in India so had been exposed th e poverty, inequality and failings of delivery systems. Mahler was vocal in his criticism of biomedical services and what they had delivered to public health, notably calli ng hospitals \u0093disease palaces\u0094 (Elling, 1981a:87; biomedical dominanc e in health services: Thirty years ago modern health technology had just awak ened and was full of promise. Since then its expansion has surpassed all dreams, only to become a nightmare. For it has become over sophisticated and over costly. It is dictating our he alth policies unwisely; and what is useful is being applied to too few. Based on these technologies, a h uge medical industry has grown up with powerful vested interests of its own. (Mahler addres sing the World Health Assembly 1978, in Mamdani, 1992:1) To Dr. Mahler, Health for All was not just a slogan, but an intern ational obligation that could be achieved with co-operation and a more rational and objectiv e resource allocation. He was acutely aware that the WHO had failed to facilitate effective s ervice delivery, to enable the level of health that it had committed itself to. Mahler saw it as \u0093 a bad joke when set against the realities of the health scene today\u0094 (in Elling, 1981b:90). A keynote ad dress he gave to the International Health Conference (1974) clearly exemplifies his passion, and graphically reflected many of the prominent concerns of the time (see appendix 3 for an excerpt of this speech; page 355). The distortions in biomedical delivery systems, geogra phic inequities (North-South, urban-rural), limits of modern technology, ex orbitant and growing costs, and the moral/ethical dimension to distributing health care resource s were all raised. He pithily summed up the current situation as \u0093serving champagne to the few while many do not get their daily bread.\u0094 Mahler shifted the focus of WHO from a narrow disease orientation (v ertical interventions) to broader socioeconomic factors and their role in health status. He m anaged to galvanise the organisation, and infuse it with the courage and commitment to t ackle the complexities of improving global health status. He was described as a \u0093visionary\u0094, a \u0093 charismatic leader\u0094, and \u0093almost like a priest\u0094 according to one of his staff \u0096 \u0093Health f or all was an impossible concept, but he said it and everyone believed him\u0094 (Godlee, 1994a). Mahler m ade it clear 65that \u0093unorthodox solutions\u0094 must be sought to meet this ambitious goa l, as it was \u0093beyond the scope of the present health care system and personnel trained in modern medicine\u0094 - even if resorting to TRM was \u0093disagreeable to some policy makers\u0094 (Ma hler, 1977). In Dr. Mahler, traditional medicine had found a natural ally and adv ocate. This administrative support was reinforced by the Director of the Psychia tric Division and later Deputy Director-General, Dr Adeoye Lambo. Lambo was a psychiatr ist who had been involved in projects in Nigeria establishing \u0093therapeutic villages\u0094 t o treat mental illness, using traditional practitioners (Lambo, 1967, 1973). Therefore, he was f amiliar with the primary resources of TRM and had a belief in their efficacy and value, s pecifically in a field where biomedical resources were considered inadequate. Under their guidance, the international health community made an a brupt about face. In the 1950\u0092s and 1960s, \u0093pr imitive\u0094 TRM systems were seen as an obstacle by the WHO to populations in the South adopting new health practices. The struggle against disease, ignorance and poverty has be en retarded by the persistence of superstitious beliefs and practices the path from magic to medicine has often been slow and difficult Adjustment to the machine age is a long pr ocess of social education (WHO First Report on the World Health Situation 1954-1956 in Lee, 1997). TRM was considered a cultural and social barrier to the unreserv ed acceptance of biomedicine and an expression of the \u0093backwardness\u0094 that modernisat ion efforts were to eliminate. Most countries in the South (with some notable excepti ons such as China and India) had a policy of \u0093eradicating\u0094 TRM (Riley, 1977:554) and replacing it with the primary resources of biomedicine. However, in the late 1970s, TRM systems were formally endorsed and their role in health care systems promoted. Whether th ese pronouncements could overcome decades of entrenched structural superiority of b iomedicine on national and international levels remained to be seen (discussed in the follow ing chapter). 3.3.1 Changing composition and focus By the 1970s, the WHO had changed greatly in me mbership and focus than that of its first decades of operation from inception in 1948 (Lee, 1997; Walt, 1993). In the 1960s, ther e was an influx of newly independent member states from former colonies. M embership nearly doubled and became weighted to countries from the South, who cou ld control the agenda for the first time by forming the two-thirds majority required for W orld Health Assembly decisions (Godlee, 1994a). This membership broadened the agenda, althou gh the new focus 66politicised the organisation and made decisions more contentio us (Godlee, 1994a; Walt, 1994:138).24 The changes in administration (a new Director-General and Depu ty) and membership fostered an environment receptive to TRM, as a majorit y of member-states were facing health crises equipped only with inadequate biomedica l infrastructure, and a lack of required resources to feasibly expand it. One new WHO member made a spectacular impact on the internationa l public health community. In 1972, Nixon visited China in an effort to forge clos er relations between it and the United States, and stimulated international interest i n the previously isolated country. In the following years, China re-established diplomatic relations wi th the North and in 1973 joined the WHO. Much interest was generated in the health syste m as it had evolved under a Communist government, and the impressive health gains attained (Lee, 1997; Sidel & Sidel, 1975). Attention was focussed on the progress made in controlling inf ectious diseases, decreasing infant mortality, improving nutrition and successfull y extending basic health services. Over thirty years (1952-1982), China\u0092s average life expec tancy increased from 35 to 68 years, infant mortality was reduced from 250 to 40 deaths per 1000 live b irths and the prevalence of malaria decreased from 5.5% to 0.3% of the population (H siao, 1995:1047). These rapid improvements were considered all the more remarkable i n light of the large population and low per capita income, lack of professionally traine d health personnel and limited biomedical infrastructure. Their successes were a result of organisation and distribution of limited resources, rather than of increasing expenditure (Cox, 1989:44). A country with around one fifth of the world\u0092s population had constru cted an outstanding health care system not based on biomedical professionals or biomedic al primary resources and with no assistance from the WHO (Lee, 1997:33). It presented an \u0093i ntriguing paradox\u0094 in that it was classified as a developing country, yet had ac hieved health indices and mortality statistics that rivalled that of industrialised Western countries (Blendon, 1979). How this had been done, and whether other countries could mimic the methods used, became a pertinent question (Good et al., 1979:152; Leslie, 1980:192; Pang, 1976:129). It was considered a blueprint worthy of emulation and became a prototype for b oth the WHO and World Bank (Doyal, 1979:288). Chinese health policy was lavishly prai sed by commentators of the time (Doyal, 1979:349) and in the United States, China became a \u0093ca use celebre\u0094 24 In the 1960s, the growing confidence and assertive ness of the South had even led to the Sri Lankan go vernment to propose to China to establish an Asian Health Or ganisation, which would have corresponded with the WHO but instead of being staffed and dominated by biomedica l professionals, it would be staffed by practitione rs of Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine and other Asian systems (Leslie, 1989:25). 67among health professionals, reflected by an increase in journal ar ticles and research activity focused on this issue (McQueen, 1985). Some even asked whether its pl uralistic system should become a model for US health care delivery, and not just the South (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:547). A main area of interest was in the unique approach of using a new for m of health worker - \u0093barefoot doctors\u0094 to deliver basic services, and the related aspect of combining traditional and biomedical knowledge systems. The traditional Chinese system of medicine (TCM) received great attention in these assessments, and became subje ct to increasing curiosity in the West (Walt, 1993:134), which was a society \u0093disillusioned with the growing perception of the limitations and harmfulness of Western science\u0094 and now fasc inated with exotic and esoteric philosophies (Taylor, 2004:104). In international health pl anning, the interest was related to the significant role TRM had in the development of a more equitable, economical and efficient health system, and the novelty of its treatments and theories of which Horn (1971), Sidel and Sidel (1975; 1974) and Croizier (1965; 1968; 1976) amongst others, circulated and popularised. Western journalists who accompanie d Nixon, and later medical delegations, were \u0093intensively courted by the TCM establishment\u0094 who emphasised acupuncture as a treatment modality (Beyerstein & Sampson, 1997:3). In 1977, a WHO delegation visited China, and was heavily influenced by th e paradigm of community health workers and merging old and new medical syste ms (see appendix 4 for detail on integration of TRM in China; page 356). \u0093Where China was putti ng her best foot forward and displaying the achievements of her latest policy on th e integration of Chinese and Western medicines, the West saw the \u0091long awaited panacea from th e Orient\u0092 (Taylor, 2004:105). The health improvements experienced in China and successful c hanges in health care delivery systems were significant contributory factors to t he WHO endorsement of the PHC approach and Health For All Macdon ald, 1992:18; Purcal, 1989:34). This perception increased the visibility an d profile of TRM. The proponents of TRM managed to enmesh it within this new approach to health service delivery, and other key projects. As long as the promotion of health was envisaged as an affai r of medical technology, and the necessity of very specialized medical personnel was insisted upon, t he medicine practiced by the [TRM] healers totally escaped notice in all the public health plans, and it remained a marginal reality, which in the eyes of many, had nothing to e ven do with medicine per se (Bibeau, 1979:183). This receptiveness to new approaches was also facilitated by the failure of vertical approaches to address disease. For two decades prior to the mid-1970s , the WHO had based 68its strategy on targeted interventions to eliminate specific di seases, such as malaria, leprosy, trachoma and schistomiasis. However, despite success eradicati ng smallpox, this narrow disease focus was becoming problematic. For example, the malar ia programme faced DDT resistance and a lack of health infrastructure in the South for de tection and treatment (Godlee, 1994a; Walt, 1993:133-134; Walt, 2001). After a decade, malaria rates w ere unchanged or even higher in the majority of countries where it had bee n implemented \u0096 severely denting the WHO\u0092s credibility (Mull, 1990:31-32). The failure of the malaria eradication programme is attrib uted to an ideological shift within the organisation. Drugs, vaccines, and medical technologies (biomedic al primary resources) were failing to make lasting improvements to population health or mee t programme objectives. These frustrating failures were the crucible within the organisation to reconsider health planning and endorse a new approach \u0096 PHC (Mull, 1990:28; Newell, 1988:903; Walt, 1994). While China provided the inspiration for TRM, the Soviet Union prompted the Alma Ata Declaration (Lee, 1997:25; Litsios, 2002). Communist ideals of comprehensive community based health care were being devised and successfully i mplemented in some countries (besides China, such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietn am, Cuba, Nicaragua), which demonstrated that alternatives to vertical interventions were feasible . The politics stream (administration, membership) within WHO was therefore amen able to new approaches, the problem (lack of resources, failure of vertical approaches) was clearly established throughout the decade and the solution (integration of TRM ) was present within the policy stream .25 China entering the WHO and failure of malaria eradication cou ld be considered catalysts for a change in approach to the delivery of health care services on the policy agenda (see Lee, 1997; Walt, 1993 for more detail on the environment o f the WHO). 3.3.2 Formalising the role of TRM in health care Many accounts of the WHO involvement with TRM commence with the mid-1970s and the resolutions of the World Health Assemblies of 1976 or 1977 (Akerele, 1987; Chi, 1994; Green, 1988; P illsbury, 1982). However, traditional medicine was mentioned in 1969 (resolution WHA 22.54), which concerned the establishment of pha rmaceutical production in developing countries. The World Health Assembly \u0093being awar e of the differences in the development of therapeutic practices\u0094 expressed concern about t he \u0093hazards and economic 25 This same environment was not conducive for other p olicy initiatives within WHO that proposed continui ng vertical, disease specific interventions such as tub erculosis control (Ogden, Walt, & Lush, 2003). 69wastage connected with the empirical use of [traditional medicine s] as long as their efficacy and safety have not been established.\u0094 However, this was with the aw areness that \u0093scientific research in this field may yield valuable pharmaceutical produc ts.\u0094 It was an ambiguous beginning to the formal recognition of TRM, and sto pped short of positively endorsing it. TRM was not necessarily safe or effective ( and could even be dangerous and wasteful), but with scientific research, may provi de some useful products. It was an aspect of local culture that needed to be rationalised wit h the establishment of domestic pharmaceutical industries. This resolution may be se en as a vestige of the modernisation push, as it reflected the ideology that the use of TRM w as unfounded and hindered development. TRM was viewed as not a legitimate therape utic practice in itself, but its primary resources could possibly contribute to the superior, biome dical pharmaceutical armoury. Throughout the 1970s, TRM received rapidly increasing attention on the inte rnational agenda. This culminated in 1978 with a WHO technical report regard ing its promotion and further development, the establishment of a programme under the au spices of the WHO, and the inclusion of TRM in other major initiatives. The specific ac tivities of the WHO in relation to TRM during the 1970s are considered in the following three se ctions, which are roughly chronological in sequence and also categorise activities in to discrete areas that developed incrementally. Activity initially commenced with 1) traditional birth attendants (1970-1975), then moved onto making 2) resolutions (1976-78), which provided a foundation for 3) programme development and promotion (1976-1979). Program me development is sub-divided into the separate activities that involved TR M: a) technical report on TRM; b) traditional medicine programme; c) essential drug s and d) primary health care. 3.3.2:1) Traditional birth attendants In the early 1970s, the first forays of the WHO into TRM were in the ar ea of traditional birth attendants (TBAs). TBAs are considered one subset of TRM practiti oners, with a focus on pregnancy and obstetrics. Activity in this area also occurred prior to the 1970s, but was not co-ordinated or systematic. The increasing WHO interest in T BAs and their role in maternal and child health care was a natural outcome of many of the concerns of the day: population control (family planning), community based approaches, using exi sting local resources, and reaching areas not served by biomedical infrastructure. These co ncerns merged neatly into the focal point of the TBA, of which there was usually at least one i n every village and who 70attended up to 90% of births.26 They represented an easily identified access point to an audience that health care agencies were keen to reach \u0096 mother s and children. This was particularly the case as high infant mortality rates were a star k indicator of poor health status, and could be reduced with improved care during birth and infancy. The motivations behind seeking alternative approaches to meet ing basic health care needs was affirmed in a TBA training guide (1979b). Modernisation assumpt ions were discredited, economic growth will not necessarily improve the quality of lif e of the poor, and \u0093health development is both a means to and a product of social and economic deve lopment ...\u0094 Due to this, and the imbalance between health needs and resourc es available, approaches \u0093that depend neither on the building of costly hospitals nor on the provision of sophisti cated services by personnel trained at exorbitant cost\u0094 were required. Evidence of the successful blending of traditional and mod ern medicine, such as has occurred in China, for example, and the findings of numerous anthropological and oth er studies of traditional healers have raised questions in the mind s of many as to whether scientific health services are the only way to health (WHO, 1979b:7, emphasis added). In 1972, the WHO undertook an international survey of 20 countries and their use of TBAs. This was followed by a consultation on The role of the TBA in maternal and child health and family planning in 1973, and two Interregional Seminars in Chile and the Philippines in 1974. At the consultation in 1973, a list of existing practices of the TBA was compiled, divided into sections according to whether they were harmful (t o be abandoned), harmless (ignored) and safe or beneficial (reinforced). The harmful pract ices were discussed, and modifications to be made to those practices proposed. This provoked a hea ted debate, with some \u0093vigorously opposed to the list of modifications, arguing that t he prescriptions were totally unrealistic\u0094 (WHO, 1979b:26). This task would inspire debate a s it involves redefining the scope of primary resource base (techniques) of the TB A. The outcomes of these exercises were reported on in 1975 (Verderes e & Turnbull, 1975). This report was undertaken with financial assistance from the UN Fund for Population Activities. The results of the international survey of TBAs ( 1972) were presented in annex 3 (Verderese & Turnbull, 1975:98) and reveals the scope of the programmes. Basic subjects were broadly offered, such as preparation and care of equipm ent and materials, hygiene, and management of labour. More \u0093complex\u0094 subjects, traditionally the domai n of biomedical 26 An average of 67% of births in developing countries were attended by \u0093others\u0094 (a grouping that include s TBAs) (Verderese & Turnbull, 1975:93). 71professionals, were offered less often \u0096 e.g. physical examinati on, urine testing, recognition and handling of complications in the newborn. However, instructi on on when to seek the help of, or refer to the biomedical profession, was more popular. The s trict demarcation of roles was more explicitly stated in some countries.27 These restrictions reflect the establishment of boundaries to protect the primary resource base (knowledge , techniques, equipment) of the biomedical profession. The \u0093lack of emphasis\u0094 on family planning, and the fact that only five countries included it in their programs was specifically noted by the authors of the report (Verderese & Turnbull, 1975). The strong link between family planning and the TBA training prog rams was exemplified by the fact that in some countries, the teachers were members of the family planning board.28 It was implicit that a main role expected of the TBA was in famil y planning as well as maternal and child health, both delegated, rout ine tasks from the biomedical sphere.29 The limited autonomy of the TBA, and their aux iliary role to the biomedical service is apparent in annex v (Verderese & Turnbull, 1975:106-110). This is an extensive list of the \u0093suggested tasks of the trained traditional birth attendant working in collaboration with the health establishment\u0094. The list itself is five pages long, and refl ects not only a poor appreciation of socio-economic conditions but also an unrealistic exp ectation of what the TBA could reasonably do, and their cultural role and social funct ion. In effect, the tasks specified simultaneously expected the TBA to be a menial assist ant while having detailed knowledge of biomedical concepts.30 The subservient role of the TBA to biomedical professionals was reinforced through repeated reference to her ro le in collaboration with, under supervision of and with instruction from the \u0093health establishment\u0094. 27 \u0093Several programmes specified actions not to be tak en such as: \u0091not to render midwifery services in th e presence of loss of blood or haemorrhage during pre gnancy; when the arm is delivered first\u0092, etc. Some o f the don\u0092ts also include: \u0091not to introduce the fingers or an y instruments or objects in the birth canal of the m other with the purpose of performing examination or any other reason s, not to give injections in the birth canal\u0092, etc\u0094 (1975:99, emphasis in original) 28 See Manderson (1989) for a discussion on the surve illance of traditional mid-wives and their use as an extension of state control over reproduction. 29 In terms of family planning, specific tasks include d informing women of common side effects of contrac eption (\u0093of no significance, but which require reassurance\u0094), d istributing non-clinical contraceptives, providing f amily planning guidance, and to \u0093counteract and/or inform the staf f of the health establishment of any unfavourable rum our that might undermine family planning\u0094. The Orwellian overt ones extended to requesting that the TBA \u0093inform the staff of the health establishment of her activities\u0094 and atte nd meetings arranged by the \u0093health establishment\u0094. 30 For example: care to be provided during child birth included putting on an apron, giving an enema, clean ing the mother, changing her clothes, offering food/drink, w rapping the baby in a pre-warmed cloth and informin g the \u0093health establishment\u0094 of the delivery. Post-partum c are involved observing the breasts and advising on swe llings, fissures, colostrum and presence of maternal milk; signs of puerperal infection, delayed hae morrhage, urinary retention and urinary tract infection. 72An unpublished evaluation undertaken of the experience of TBAs in using midwifery kits provided by UNICEF in 1976-77 (WHO, 1979b:100), was revealing. Of the 38 TBAs questioned, six of them had not even used their kits. Only two found a ll 18 items in the kit easy to handle, and five had forgotten how to use nearly half of them. Som e of the confusion was due to the sheer number of items and apparent duplication of use. Despite that, the results were not interpreted as an indication of a need to simp lify the kit. One conclusion that could be drawn is that the kit contained items that were superflu ous to the requirements of the TBA, and perhaps discouraged the use of the kit itself. Reducing the number of items would be a cost saving, and shorten training. In addition, some of the i tems in the kit were not compatible with WHO training at regional levels \u0096 for example , for the TBA not to insert instruments (Verderese & Turnbull, 1975:99). However, when assessing this information, the WHO drew two main co nclusions. The first was that there was a need to be aware of the contradictions betwee n what the TBAs \u0093aver [assert] by word and what they do in practise\u0094. For example, al l of them had agreed that the kits were useful, although some had never used them. Others insiste d that they did not know how to use certain items as these had not been demonstrated in tra ining. Therefore, it was concluded that TBAs may not always tell the truth. The other main c onclusion drawn was that repeated practical training in the use of each item in the k it was required (WHO, 1979b:39). The weakness of this programme was not in the kit itself, nor the training methods used. Rather, the focus of the failure was placed on the inabi lity of the TBA to absorb the primary resource base (knowledge, techniques, instrumen ts) of biomedicine rather than pointing to the potential inappropriateness (or even reject ion) of the resources themselves. The discussion on incentives to encourage co-operation of TBAs (Verderese & Turnbull, 1975:31) is interesting in that it elucidates the operation of Unschu ld\u0092s theory of medico- cultural conflict (1975; 1976b). In Unshuld\u0092s terminology, the TBA already had access to the secondary resources of status and prestige \u0096 they often exercise cons iderable power and authority in the community sphere and may be the wife or mother of t he village chief (Verderese & Turnbull, 1975:11). The authors were therefore aware of the need to provide incentives and \u0093symbols of prestige\u0094 (material rewards or secondary r esources) for co- operation. They advised that in deciding the most suitable incentiv e scheme, community leaders should be asked to choose from a range of alternatives. Howev er, caution was given 73regarding direct cash incentives \u0096 TBAs \u0093may become motivated by money\u0094 and it could \u0093cause jealousy and mistrust\u0094 as well as criticism of bri bery.31 The TBA was being asked to transfer her existing secondary resource s (status and prestige) to the \u0093health establishment\u0094, and accept limited material rewards as compensation. In addition, her traditional primary resource base (skills and techni ques) were downplayed in importance and considered outmoded or inadequate, to be repla ced with the biomedical primary resource base. This was still under the control of the \u0093health establishment\u0094, who had to train her in its use and retained responsibility for its owne rship. She was an \u0093attendant\u0094 (auxiliary, assistant), not a professional in her ow n right with access to a distinct resource base. Shifting primary resources from one group to another is e asier, once the second group (in this case, TBAs) \u0093has recognised that these resour ces will be of use in gaining access to more secondary resources (economic benefits)\u0094 ( Unschuld, 1976b:8). Later, the issue of paying TBAs was clarified and retention by the TBA of their original role and identity was considered important from a remuneration pers pective (WHO, 1979b). Rather than assuming responsibility for tasks previously perfor med by biomedical practitioners, the TBA was only to \u0093perform more safely those t asks they generally perform on the basis of the principles of mutual self-help and humanitarianism \u0094 (WHO, 1979b:8, emphasis added). If the TBA partially acquired the primary resource s of biomedicine, then the avenue for claiming secondary resources was open. However, by jus t \u0093upgrading\u0094 their skills within their traditional roles, the TBA would also contin ue to be unpaid for her services. The reluctance of many health professionals to \u0093take advantage of improvements that can follow from a more effective collaboration\u0094 was also noted, an d considered to arise \u0093from the lack of knowledge about traditional systems of health care\u0094 (Ve rderese & Turnbull, 1975:84), rather than due to a lack of incentives and threats to their se condary resources (economic benefits, status, prestige) that may arise from sharing r esponsibilities. Education and training on both sides therefore seemed necessary; however the e mphasis was on the education and training of the TBA. This was in order for her to accept \u0093modern\u0094 concepts and therefore become the agent to \u0093modernising\u0094 community attitude s to hygiene, nutrition 31 These items were grouped as material or social good s. However, the material goods (water, housing, agri cultural supplies) seemed to be offer what should be classif ied as \u0093social benefits\u0094 and some of the social ben efits category (television and radio sets) appeared to be material goods. The \u0093social benefits\u0094 group was defined by w hat behavioural change they may inspire (i.e. \u0093modernisati on\u0094 along western lines), which is assumed would ul timately benefit the community. It is ironic that the water s upply is a reward upon compliance, but not installed as a requirement to fulfil the prescribed duties. Educat ion, agricultural supplies and clothing were \u0093symbol s of prestige\u0094 rather than necessities. 74and family planning, as well as channelling the community to recogni se and use biomedical services (the \u0093health establishment\u0094). What this approach failed to recognise was the integrity of TRM sy stems, and the fact that manpower and techniques were dimensions of that system rather tha n simply primary resources that could be readily absorbed within biomedicine. As TBAs were not professionalised in the Western sense32 and had localised rather than centralised power, they appeared to enable more ready adaptation to and absorption wi thin biomedical systems. However, tension and conflict rather than co-operation soon manif ested: \u0093 on the whole, professional health workers have been hostile to them [and] cri ticize them endlessly with stories to prove their ignorance, superstition, unsanitary habits a nd uneducatability\u0094 (Leslie, 1980:192). Thorne and Montague (1977) noted \u0093 massive reluctance on the par t of both trained medical personnel and traditional midwives to open a dialogue\u0094 (in Leslie, 1980:192). 3.3.2:2) Resolutions The resolutions on TRM were stimulated by increasing activity in T RM at regional levels. For example, in 1976, Regional Committees in Africa and South Eas t Asia discussed the official use of traditional healers by governments, and a board of exp erts was formed to propose modes of co-operation between modern and traditional m edicines (Brazzaville, Africa). In the following year in Sri Lanka, the regional committ ee considered the development of a programme in TRM and recommended that governments in the region make policy decisions to recognise, promote, and rehabilitate TR M. The activity at regional levels and increasing co-ordination of TRM interests would have b een a factor in World Health Assembly recognition. The growing importance and recogn ition of TRM is reflected in the dedication of an issue of the WHO publication World Health to it in 1977, with a foreword by the Director-General, Mahler (Mahler, 1977). 3.3.2:2a) Resolution WHA29.72 (1976) The recognition and utilisation of TRM continued with a spate of resolutions in the mid- 1970s. In 1976, the World Health Assembly, in light of the \u0093absolute and relative shortage of 32 The first step to professionalisation is acceptanc e of remuneration for services, which was not common for TBAs. However, TBAs did have some aspects of professionalisatio n as identified by Unschuld, including monopoly, autonomy and status. TBAs derived their professional identity from \u0091traditional legitimacy\u0092 rather than \u0091 rational-legal legitimacy\u0092. 75health manpower and the often inadequate and irrelevant training of such manpower\u0094 made brief reference to TRM. One of the seven requests was \u0093to e ncourage the development of health teams trained to meet the health needs of populations, incl uding health workers for primary health care, and taking into account, where appropriate, the man po wer reserve constituted by those practising traditional medicine\u0094 (WHA29.72). TR M practitioners represented a ready reserve of labour for other health care activit ies, in much in the same way as TBAs had. The focus broadened out from a subset of TRM practit ioners, to TRM practitioners more generally. 3.3.2:2b) Resolution WHA30.49 (1977) The resolution of 1977 (WHA30.49), is usually considered the official comme ncement of WHO endorsement of TRM, and related to the promotion and developmen t of training and research. This resolution made reference to the fact that healt h care in developing countries had not reached the majority of the population, and the importa nce of using local health resources. The community acceptance of TRM and the importa nt role it played was also noted: \u0093 immediate, practical and effective measures to ut ilize traditional systems of medicine fully are necessary and highly desirable.\u0094 This resolution encouraged more attention be paid to TRM, and reque sted organisation of training and research activities. This included awarding fell owships \u0093for training in research techniques, for studies of health care systems and for investigating the technological procedures related to traditional/indigenous systems of medicine. \u0094 Unlike the resolutions preceding and following it, this agreement considered TRM syste ms as a whole, including their \u0093technological procedures\u0094. Technology was no longer solely the prese rve of biomedicine, TRM also used techniques that were acknowledged as technology i n their own right. However, Pillsbury notes that this resolution follow ed heavy debate and was still heavily qualified and cautiously worded (1982:1826). 3.3.2:2c) Resolution WHA31.33 (1978) In 1978, a resolution was passed (WHA31.33) which focussed specifical ly on the use of medicinal plants. This recognised the importance of medicinal plan ts in health care systems in developing countries, the \u0093increasing awareness of governments and t he scientific and medical communities of this matter\u0094 and that the use of such plant s was likely to continue. However, it considered that while these plants \u0093contain substances which may be of therapeutic value [they] may also possibly show potential toxicit y when improperly used\u0094. 76Therefore, compiling inventories and therapeutic classifica tions, reviewing the scientific data of efficacy; developing and applying \u0093scientific criteria and m ethods for proof of safety and efficacy\u0094; and developing international standards for \u0093identi ty, purity and strength and manufacturing practices\u0094 was deemed necessary. Establishing \u0093m ethods for the safe and effective use of medicinal plant products including labelling cont aining adequate directions for use, and criteria for use or prescription by various le vels of health workers\u0094 was also required. This carefully worded resolution was peculiar, although more accommodating than the resolution of 1969. It encapsulated the \u0093double-edged sword\u0094 dilemma of political recognition of TRM systems. While it recognised the importance of medicinal plants and acknowledged that their use was likely to continue, it also stre ssed \u0093potential toxicity\u0094 and the application of scientific values to validate and standardise them. The safety and efficacy agenda reflected a concern with only one dimension of TRM systems (ph ytotherapy or plant remedies), and emphasised issues removed from their local sphere of practice. It encouraged the \u0093modernisation\u0094 and universal application of TRM through adopt ion of biomedical concepts. The broader use of TRM remedies in health care systems raised ne w issues from the scientific community, as reflected in this resolution (label ling, directions for use, and criteria for use or prescription by others). However, developing international s tandards for \u0093identity, purity and strength\u0094 revealed a perspective that failed to appreciate di vergences within and between TRM systems, even in such basic aspects such as the n ames of plants, their preparation and therapeutic use. For example, even within o ne TRM system such as Ayurveda, there are localised differences in plant names and uses. T his takes into account geographical variations in vegetation and climate. Strength or pote ncy varies according to locale, soil, season, time picked and other factors including t he type of vessel the remedy is prepared in, what it is mixed with, temperature and preparati on processes. This local knowledge of bioactive fluctuations and interactions has been clinicall y verified (Bannerman, 1982:10; Barsh, 1997:31-32). The majority of TRM plant based remedies were still prepared in local clinics or pharmacies and the home, not mass-produced industrially. While in some countrie s (e.g. India, China, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh) small scale commercial enterprises had b een established, producing \u0093general\u0094 traditional remedies (using formulae th at were thousands of years old); this did not totally displace production at the local and househol d level. The fact that these remedies had been used safely and effectively for thousands of year s was usually considered 77a sufficient evidence base by practitioners. This was determined from observation and practical use, rather than from clinical experimental methods . The focus of TRM is on the patient as an individual, with a unique aet iology of illness. According to TRM, no two people are alike, and no two people will share t he same diagnosis and prescription. Therefore, the practitioner (or an assistant) may blend a specific remedy immediately after the consultation, to treat the manifestatio n of the illness in that person (but not in another, who may even show identical symptoms). Age, weig ht, sex are all taken into account (Lock, 1990:43). A verbal explanation of how to use the remedy is prov ided at dispensation, as this again varies. The highly specialised a nd individualised nature of the preparation of remedies extends to harvesting particular parts of plants at specific times of the day or season, lunar phase (Jagtenberg & Evans, 2003), plane tary activity, compass direction, altitude, signs or signals from animals or birds in the envi ronment, and state of mind of the person gathering the plants (Gerke & Jacobson, 1996).33 In addition, some uses, identification and preparation of plants rema ined secret, passed down verbally for generations. This not only protected secondary resources , but was considered a key factor in efficacy \u0096 if the secrecy is compromised, the effi cacy or potency of the remedy is deemed to be diminished (Perara, 1985:95; van der Geest, 1997:905). Such in formation was not always in the public domain, but orally transferred from father to son, guru to disciple, master to apprentice or from a \u0093divine source\u0094 to a specif ic person (Airhihenbuwa, 1995:59; Ramprasad, 1994:134). The recipient of such knowledge usually had to demonstrate particular character traits, signifying worthiness a s a beneficiary (Chauhan, 2000; Gerke & Jacobson, 1996). For example, that they would utilise the know ledge in a positive and humane way, and not for personal material gain. In man y TRM systems, access to primary resources was therefore given if this knowledge and techniq ues were not exploited to gain economic secondary resources. It was an act of ser vice to gain merit (Perara, 1985:97). To impose international standardisation on factors like plant na mes, uses and labelling removes an aspect of localised cultural expression, and overlooks some im portant features of TRM systems, such as knowledge transmission and remedy formulation . The procedures for 33 Individual preparation is considered a significant aspect of the therapeutic process and a part of the healer-patient relationship. For example, an Ayurvedic doctor may ch ant mantras to instil the remedy with particular po tency. In some cases, even the number of times the mixture is s tirred or the direction it is stirred in is specifi ed. This aids natural/supernatural forces that infuse the remedy with healing power. In Tibetan medicine, consecrati on of raw materials and blessings are seen as essential contr ibutions to the remedy (Gerke & Jacobson, 1996). Th e therapeutic effectiveness of some remedies therefor e cannot be reduced to strictly biological terms. T his is also a major feature of African TRM (Koumare, 1983:26). 78this assessment of TRM were determined and supervised by biomedi cal interests \u0096 an unambiguous expression of structural power and authority. The very act of naming things and bestowing meanings is a source of power (Wolf 1982:388 in Finkler, 2004:8). Categorisation and demarcation of TRM primary resources is not s imply an analytical exercise. A characteristic Gieryn noted of scientists more br oadly can be paraphrased and applied to biomedical practitioners: \u0093 because of the considerable material opportunities and professional advantages available only to \u0093scientists\u0094 [doct ors], it is no mere academic matter to decide who is doing science [medicine or health care] an d who is not\u0094 (Gieryn, 1983:781). The intrinsic biomedical reductionist stance and pharmacologic al concepts are evident in the language and focus of this resolution: for example; that plants may contain substances of therapeutic value. This notion exemplifies the belief that th ere is a single therapeutic agent that can be identified, and that isolating this molecule verifi es clinical validity and efficacy. In contrast, TRM belief systems often use the whole plant or more than one plant, and process them in complicated ways to produce a compound that opera tes synergistically. Biological catalysts used in herbal remedies may have obscure biochem ical mechanisms that are difficult to clinically isolate or identify (Barsh, 1997:32). T he plant or plant parts in their natural form are also considered important, and extracting certain molecules from them may reduce ultimate effectiveness (Bodeker, 1994b:11-12; Scarpa, 1981).34 In reducing plants and remedies to purely physical and biological interpretations, the s ocial and cultural context was removed from the therapeutic encounter. This resolution on medicinal plants (WHA31.33) appears to promote TR M, but exposes fundamental conceptual clashes between biomedical and TRM system s. While biomedicine is based on a single cause/single cure for disease, and therefor e presents no difficulties in mass production or international standardisation (and even deman ds it), the situation is markedly different in TRM where treatment is unique, consultat ion itself forms part of the therapeutic process and the plants in their natural source and as pa rt of complicated amalgams are valued. In addition, while biomedical doctors would undoubtedly be disturbed by the concept of allowing prescription of pharmaceutical products by \u0093 various levels of health workers\u0094, this resolution requests that in relation to her bal medicines. The biomedical community was asking for their standards and norms of measure ment, efficacy and so on, to 34 Two examples illustrate this point: The natural so urce of quinine (cinchona bark) is more effective t han the synthetic anti-malarials modelled on it, to which r esistance has developed (Bodeker, 1994b:12). The ac tive ingredient of digitalis (digitalin) is extracted and used to treat heart conditions. This accumulates in the body and cannot be used indefinitely. However, TRM systems us e this plant in entirety and it has been found that besides the active principle, other substances in the plant prev ent the toxic accumulation of digitalin (Scarpa, 1981 :319). 79be imposed on TRM; and for TRM practitioners to provide access to thei r primary resource base for scientific scrutiny and lay distribution. If TRM systems sought political recognition, it required accepting the hegemonic \u0093scientific-rational ist\u0094 framework, in violation of some of their core principles. 3.3.2:3) Programme development and promotion In 1975, the WHO in conjunction with UNICEF, began to explore methods, other t han those based on biomedical models, to improve health care delivery (Djukanovic & Mach, 1975; WHO, 1975). Alternative approaches to meeting basic health needs in developi ng countries (Djukanovic & Mach, 1975) criticised the emphasis on specific disease s (vertical interventions) which was considered to have hindered the developm ent of basic health services. A new approach was needed because \u0093the strategy adopted by many developing countries has been modelled on that of the industrialised countri es, but as a strategy it has been a failure\u0094 (Djukanovic & Mach 1975:7). The assumption that biomedica l systems would organically expand to cover entire populations as resources all owed, was exposed as a fallacy: the enthusiastic application of new knowledge and techno logy has not always achieved the results expected, and some of the consequences have be en untoward history and experience show that conventional health services, organ ised along \u0091Western\u0092 or other centralized lines, are unlikely to expand to meet the basi c health needs of all people\u0094 (Djukanovic & Mach 1975:7). A more permanent, equitable and sustainable system using local res ources was required. Case studies were undertaken exploring how to achieve this, and the results were considered \u0093sufficiently promising to warrant a major change in policy enab ling such programmes to be fostered, extended, adapted and used as examples for a large s cale global programme\u0094 (Djukanovic & Mach, 1975:104). It was acknowledged, however, that this altern ative approach would require a \u0093virtual revolution in most health serv ice systems\u0094 (1975:103), as it involved a major reallocation of funds, decentralisation of admi nistration, community involvement, and integration and co-ordination. \u0093It will bring about changes in the distribution of power, in the pattern of political decision-making a nd in people\u0092s awareness of what they are entitled to\u0094 (1975:104). This report was an explicit official recognition that sole reliance on biomedical primary resource s was unsatisfactory, and a major reorientation of health care was required. It also ackn owledged the political dimension of health care. 80Despite the radical implications, incorporating TRM as part of a basic health service was considered the best way forward, and one that the WHO seemed will ing to consider more seriously. In 1975, a taskforce was formed to examine the use of indigenous plants for fertility regulation \u0096 again reflecting a preoccupation with popu lation growth as had been already clear with TBA initiatives. This group used a meti culous approach to screening plants for potential contraceptive use. The scientific methodology w as directed from Geneva, guiding six research centres (WHO, 1978b:34). Of all the known species us ed in TRM for contraception, which numbered in the thousands, 250 were event ually chosen (according to specific criteria) for investigation. The criteria include d that it could be orally administered, cheap and non-toxic and act as an anti-implantation agent (Wi jesekera, 2003). Each team was assigned 50-75 plant species to investigate, and each fo llowed the same strict protocols and communicated findings to each other. This program wa s still operating in 1977, but the outcomes are uncertain as any reports produced were not made public. However, the teams managed to isolate eight plant species with pote ntial to fulfil all criteria, of which two demonstrated definite clinical use as fertility re gulating agents. According to a scientist who worked in this program, these two options were not pursued due to pharmaceutical industry interests, and the difficulty in comp eting against the market for steroid based contraceptives that had been established (Wijeseke ra, 2003).35 In this case, the primary resource base of TRM (despite meeting scientific criter ia), was opposed by the primary resource base of biomedicine and the powerful commercial inc entives that sustained it. In 1976, a WHO research project reviewed the scientific literature available on the safety and efficacy of TRM remedies. The results of this project also remaine d unpublished. In the same year, an \u0093expert consultation group\u0094 was convened by the Deputy Di rector General, Lambo. This group included anthropologists such as Unschuld, Lesl ie and Singer and aimed to \u0093give prominence, by the quality of [the] expert deliberations, to t raditional medicine\u0094 (Singer, 1988:9). A Working Group on TRM was also established at the headquar ters, under the leadership of a biomedical doctor from Ghana, Dr Bannerman. Th e \u0093Headquarters Working Group on Traditional Medicine\u0094 convened a meeting on the promotion and development of traditional medicine, held in 1977. This was a direct result of the growing 35 In 1952, WHO decided not to undertake population p rogrammes due to the religious and political implic ations; in the 1960s it agreed to give technical advice on famil y planning on request (Godlee, 1994a). A new UN or ganisation (UNFPA) was established in 1969 specifically to dea l with population because both the WHO and UNICEF r efused to enter into this politically sensitive field (Lee et al., 1996). In the 1970s the WHO was straying int o this arena via TRM (TBAs and this programme \u0096 the WHO Special Progr amme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction) which may partially explain the lack of publicity given to the fertility regulation programme and its outcomes. 81interest in TRM, the resolution of the same year to give more priorit y to research and training, and \u0093subsequent requests by Member States for technical collaboration\u0094 (WHO, 1978b). The seven members of the meeting were all from the South, apart f rom an expert in Asian science and medicine from the United States. They represented diverse TRM systems as well as backgrounds in psychology, physiology, community health, and medici nal plants. The Secretariat and WHO working group present at the meeting were al l biomedical doctors, and outnumbered the members by nearly two to one. The report of this meeting, The Promotion and Developmen t of Trad itional Medicine (WHO, 1978b), was a qualified endorsement of TRM, representing the need to balance competing biomedic al and TRM interests over the recognition and legitimation of TRM primary resources (drugs, techniques, knowledge). 3.3.2:3a) Technical Report 622: The Promotion and Developmen t of TRM The technical report (WHO, 1978b) was not universally welcomed, and was c riticised as being unlike other technical reports in that it \u0093neglects scie ntific and objective dealing in favour of emotional advocacy of integrating traditional medicine in to the health services\u0094 (Velimirovic, 1984b:61). The report does differ from previous reports in the technical series, in that it deals with health systems issues, promotes a particul ar strategy and clearly suggests integration as a means to address failings of current health servi ces infrastructure. It is clear from the outset (including the title of the report) t hat TRM was viewed favourably and the inquiry would focus on supportive measures to endorse it. F or example, the main objective was to consider the \u0093effective collaboration of different practi tioners and their integration into an overall national health care delivery system \u0094 (1978b:7). The members were particularly impressed with the example offered by China, w hich demonstrated the extent to which integration \u0093could contribute to and even revoluti onize health care\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:41). Two films on the developments of TRM in China during the previous decade were viewed during deliberations, China was a case-study for rese arch promotion and development (WHO, 1978b:30), and it was referred to throughout the repor t: The tremendous success of the Chinese experience in the inte gration of western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine continues to provide the shin ing example of the potential which lies in integration (WHO, 1978b:17) If China could succeed within one generation, then the whole world could likewise achieve some success in providing the entire population with adequate health care services (WHO, 1978b:29). 82Other countries and their history of TRM use were also considered by the working group. Providing details of various countries experiences of TRM (Sri Lanka, Sudan, Egypt, Ghana, India, Cameroon, Mexico, Nigeria) was intended to emphasise the broadnes s of TRM scope, which had been narrowed in focus to only one dimension (medicinal pl ants) by contemporary research. \u0093 it was stressed that this tendency must not be allowed to continue to give the impression that traditional medicine was limited to m edicinal plants exclusively in the health-giving process\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:10). The entire primary resour ce base of TRM was to be recognised (knowledge, skills, drugs, techniques) not just sele cted dimensions. A reductionist stance to TRM, focusing on medicinal plants, had alr eady been recognised and deemed undesirable. The advantages of integration, apart from the \u0093intrinsic utility\u0094 of TRM, included that such systems of medicine have \u0093certain advantages over imported sys tems of medicine in any setting\u0094 due to cultural relevance. However, \u0093the most cogent re ason for the radical development and promotion of traditional medicine is that it is one of the surest means to achieve total health care coverage of the world population, using acc eptable, safe, and economically feasible methods, by the year 2000\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:14). Integration was considered beneficial because it offers mutual gains to each syst em, improves health care knowledge and coverage, enhances quality and number of practitioners , promotes information distribution related to PHC, and was the best way to achieve health care for the entire population by the year 2000 (WHO, 1978b:18). The repeated references to achieving cost effective health ca re coverage by the year 2000 were related to the WHO Health for All Goal (HFA), which had been endorsed in 1975. The main reason for integration was therefore that the primary resour ce base of biomedicine was inadequate to meet the HFA 2000 objective, and needed to be supplemente d with TRM. The promotion of TRM was thus strongly tied to a prominent and popular objec tive of the organisation, and presented as the only feasible method to achieve it. This was a shrewd political manoeuvre on behalf of the advocates for TRM which emp hasised the practical benefits of integration. Despite integration being considered easy to achieve with a ca utious approach based on research and education, anticipated obstacles or fundamental problems of integration ironically made this goal very difficult or even impossible to ac hieve (WHO, 1978b:17-18). These obstacles included prominence given to the \u0093cultural formula tion\u0094 of TRM; economic and commercial factors which favoured particular types of health c are measures; unfeasibility of integrating aspects of some TRM systems based on spiritual or moral 83principles; and conceptual gulfs between various philosophies. T he greatest problem to be overcome was considered to be \u0093administrative intransigence\u0094, and thus persuading the government and bureaucracy of the need for this approach was important . This is an implicit recognition of the dominant structural status of biomedicine in heal th services. Even in situations where the policy on integration was \u0093favourab le\u0094, other potential limitations were recognised. These were more practical obsta cles to the implementation of this policy, rather than difficulties in formulating a policy it self. Included in the list was \u0093payment of lip-service\u0094; apprehension about possible harmful effects of TRM; uncertainty about the position of those who received integrated training in current soc ial and professional hierarchies; opposition by \u0093intransigent advocates of one or another sys tem\u0094 and \u0093fear of litigation, since the legal apparatus tends to protect only the entr enched system, to encourage monopoly, and to even proscribe other systems\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:18-19). The se perceived obstacles express concern about the consequences of a redistrib ution of primary and secondary resources within bureaucratic and legal frameworks fav ourable to biomedicine, and resistance to that process of redistribution. In the professional area, dialogue and collaboration would assist i n addressing some of these anticipated obstacles, as well as \u0093replacement of existi ng council or board members with more receptive people who would appreciate the need for change to meet present\u0096day exigencies\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:20). This appears to be a reference to biomedica l professional bodies, which may resist the recognition and acceptance of TRM pri mary resources, and be reluctant to share secondary resources. Replacing senior member s of biomedical professional bodies would prevent entrenched resistance and weaken lobb ying efforts to counter integration, but would be contentious. In the community sphere, us ing \u0093integrated health teams in basic health services\u0094 was recommended, although it was unc lear whether this referred to teams consisting of biomedical and TRM practitioner s or personnel trained in both systems. China was held to be the example of effective integration , defined as a synthesis of traditional and biomedicine \u0093through the application of modern scienti fic knowledge and techniques\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:16). The superiority and hegemony of biomedicine was inherent in this definition, which had perhaps been influenced by the me mbers viewing of two films on the Chinese methods for integration. A number of points were not ed following these films on acupuncture and medicinal herbs, including \u0093the importance of appl ying modern science and technology in research on traditional medicine\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:41). Chin a had relied heavily on scientific verification of TRM in their integration s trategy (discussed in more 84detail in appendix 4; page 356), which now enhanced the status of traditio nal Chinese medicine in Committee deliberations. The parallel situation in India and Sri Lanka was noted, where tradi tional medicine had been officially recognised and developed separately from biomedicine. Thi s led to a problematic situation where \u0093the practitioners \u0091borrow\u0092 freely from one another when the health situation indicated that such a practice would be advantageous\u0094 ( WHO, 1978b:17). Parallel systems allowed the primary resource base (drugs, techniques) of the other to be co-opted according to circumstance.36 The solution to this situation was considered to be integration i n the form of synthesis of medical systems (merging of primary resour ce bases). This form of integration was considered to have advantages over parallel systems and was therefore recommended for \u0093wider implementation\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:17). Rather than r estricting the recommendation to formalisation of traditional medicine (whe ther parallel or integrative systems) the report clearly advocated a form of integration, spe cifically modelled on the Chinese experience. Processes and procedures to utilise TRM and ultimately integrate it into publ ic heath care provision included promoting research, information gathering and d issemination. Research into traditional medicine was the initial step, \u0093with a view t o assessing its claims and validating them on a scientific basis\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:17). In order to \u0093sh orten the duration of the public education process [there is] the need for an educational revol ution \u0094 involving major reforms in curricular and training (WHO, 1978b:14). In addition , it was considered necessary to educate \u0093the community to believe that the provision of traditional remedies is not second rate medicine\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:15). The primary resources of TRM were to be viewed as valuable assets, and not inferior in status to biome dical primary resources \u0096 an attitude promoted and entrenched during colonisation. In order to assist the integration process, guidance was provid ed on some pre-requisites (WHO, 1978b:19), such as generating information to educate administr ators, practitioners and the community. This information would consist of \u0093 data validated on modern scientific principles \u0094 and strategies such as development of a common pharmacology to serve as a \u0093bridge\u0094 between the systems. Obviously, it was also considered necessary to gain legal recognition and \u0093socio-political acceptability\u0094 in order to sec ure financial support. Dialogue 36 This situation had been noted with some concern by me dical anthropologists. This usually was in reference t o TRM practitioners (mis)using antibiotics, penicillin , syringes and other biomedical primary resources (B hatia et 1975:17; Taylor, 1976:288). As Unschuld\u0092s theory sugg ests, \u0093borrowing\u0094 primary resources serves to increa se access to secondary resources (status, income). Bha tia et al note that TRM practitioners who used biome dical drugs had larger clientele and greater incomes (197 5:18). 85between practitioners and the \u0093demystification of several aspects of medicine\u0094 were also criteria required to ensure eventual success. These str ategies aimed to give appreciation of the merits of each system, which would then allow public education a nd assimilation of the practitioners trained within an integrated system into the public s ervice (implicitly, those trained in a merged education system) (WHO, 1978b:19). Manpower development (WHO, 1978b:20-28) was focussed on as the main process to achieve integration. Implicitly, this dealt with using TRM pr actitioners as biomedical auxiliaries: In general it was considered desirable to mobilize the existing manpower categories for maximum utilization, since these workers have justified t heir existence by the fulfilment of health care needs in their respective communities. The pr oblem then would be one of orientation to modern concepts of health care delivery sy stems, validation of their professional claims, further development of their skills an d efficiency, and their integration into public health systems, especially in primary health care. In this respect retraining was considered essential (WHO, 1978b:21, emphasis added). The creation of a new category of personnel trained in both systems t o fill newly created roles in an expanded PHC sphere was acknowledged as offering potential, but it was decided to focus on the development of the existing manpower categories. This differed significantly from the Chinese approach of creating a new manpower category (barefoot doctors) that was trained in basic aspects of both systems. Oddly, training in Ayurveda, Sidd ha, Unani and Yoga; and training in Chinese traditional medicine including acupuncture, were also facets of the development strategy (WHO, 1978b:21). It was not stated who the int ended recipients of this training were, but it appeared to sanction and legitimise spe cific forms of TRM for wider global diffusion. These systems, indigenous to India and Chin a, were the structurally and functionally strongest in the hierarchy of TRM systems. Both enjoyed state support in their respective nations, had extensive recorded histories and w ere institutionalised and formalised to a high degree. The manpower strategy seemed to be based mainly on using TRM practi tioners and TBAs as PHC workers. The models for development considered were the trai ning of TRM practitioners as PHC workers in Cameroon, and the use of TBAs. It was n oted that changing existing attitudes of both TBAs and biomedical professionals, the c hange in status of TBAs and demand for higher remuneration may present problems (WHO, 1978b:25). T he guidelines proposed that \u0093judicious selection of tasks that coul d effectively be delegated to TBAs\u0094 was required. Therefore, careful consideration of which aspec ts of the biomedical primary resource base to relinquish was needed, with awareness t hat this may lead to 86increased claims by the TBA on secondary resources (material rew ards, status, and authority).37 The TBA is presented as a passive, less knowledgeable beneficiary of bi omedical wisdom. Although it was noted that \u0093some TBAs have [a] very high level of skills and knowledge [and] have much to contribute, even to modern obstetrical care \u0094 (WHO, 1978b:23), the flow of training and education was established as one way: from biome dical to TBA. The distinction between the inferred unskilled and untrained TBA, a nd the biomedical sphere was emphasised with reference to \u0093professional health workers \u0094 as synonymous with biomedical practitioners. This negated the TBA as part of a specialist profes sion in her own right. The diagram on the process of integration of TBAs (WHO, 1978b:24) overlooked any consultation with TBAs in formulation of policy. Instead, they first entered the process at the level of \u0093gaining acceptance of basic policy decision\u0094. The sixth part of the report dealt with research promotion and development (WHO, 1978b:29-35). As priorities would vary between countries, case-studies of different approaches taken by three countries (Mexico, Nigeria and China) were considered. The significant common feature of all these approaches was the role accor ded to science to validate or invalidate the primary resource base of TRM. This was emphasised, and practical methods that had been used to do so were outlined. Scientific re search on pharmacological compounds was a priority, and scientific transfer of techniques neces sary. Use of scientific methods and adoption of scientific discourse was deemed to give wei ght to TRM in the health field. Research into literature, and scientific studies (guided by tea ms of scientific experts) was advocated as imperative, and the principles of future development of TRM. This was despite the fact that the socio-cultural basis of TRM had been noted (WHO , 1978b:30). It was considered that the lack of use of science and technology had led to the sta gnation of TRM in some countries (WHO, 1978b:9). The final section of the technical repor t was a list of recommendations (WHO, 1978b:36-40). This list was quite detailed and aim ed to promote use of TRM in national health systems. The WHO was urged to give this hi gh priority and allocate substantial resources to ensuring the development of scheme s using TRM. 37 Unschuld\u0092s theory proposes that control of primary r esources (knowledge, techniques, drugs, facilities) allows access to the secondary resources (status, prestige, authority, income). Therefore, providing biomedica l knowledge and equipment to TBAs would automatically authorise access to secondary resources. 87Several themes were consistent throughout the TRM strategy: scientific au thority in determining what aspects of TRM to incorporate; a one way process of edu cation/training (from biomedical to TRM); a limited and subordinate role for TRM in basic services (PHC) and the use of only two dimensions of TRM systems \u0096 manpower (specifi cally TBAs) and herbal medicines. Therefore, the hierarchical superiority of biom edicine in health systems was embedded throughout the report. Two aspects of this policy document w ere commented on by Reissland and Burghart (1989). The planners acted as \u0093agents of modern medicine\u0094 and they \u0093rigidly circumscribed the terms of integration\u0094: Certain features of traditional healing, such as the use of native d rugs, were thought to be of benefit but only after their efficacy had been proven by the methods of science. The integration of traditional healers and birth attendants into the lower echelons of the state medical system was advocated, but only after the healers had been pr operly trained in medically approved procedures. In the former case, traditional medicine works , but only modern medicine knows why. In the latter case traditional healers are useful as medical auxiliaries, but only after modern medicine has rendere d them in key respects scientific and in all other respects harmless (Reissland & Burghart, 1989:43, emphasis added). In Unschuld\u0092s terminology, the primary resource base of TRM (drugs, te chniques, knowledge, concepts) was subjugated to the primary resource base of biomedi cine. Biomedical scientific knowledge was the criteria advocated for as sessing TRM primary resources, which allowed biomedical experts to maintain auth ority. In effect, this allowed the biomedical profession to control the primary resources of TRM, in te rms of what was officially recognised. The manpower dimension of TRM was to be co- opted to extend basic biomedical services, and only scientifically acceptable remedie s or therapies were to be incorporated into health care delivery (or synthesised into the bi omedical primary resource base). 3.3.2:3b) Traditional Medicine Programme The Headquarters Working Group on TRM, perhaps recognising the magnit ude of some of the issues to be resolved, proposed a programme be established i n TRM, which was approved by the Executive Board in 1977. The TRM Programme can be con sidered the operative body to implement the findings of the technical report (WHO , 1978b), in terms of the identified WHO role. The Director of this programme later expl ained that it came into being due to minimal resources available to extend health services, and the exercise of political power by newly independent countries which reflected broader t rends in the policy arena (self-determination, use of local resources): \u0093The first factor is related to national 88group pride and is associated with past heritage and newly gained na tional independence. The second factor is linked to utilisation of all available resource s\u0094 (Akerele, 1983). Unschuld proposed that attaching TRM to nationalistic agendas was simply a method used to \u0093disguise the fight for resources\u0094 and that arguments based on cult ural heritage and nationalism prevented the loss of their primary resource base (1976b:18) . Therefore, while there was a practical and rational concern with a lack of biomedical resources, the proposal to extend the medical resource base by recognising TRM was also a politi cal strategy by those groups to gain official recognition of TRM primary resources , and thus potentially extend access to secondary resources (state financial support, status). The WHO states the motive for the establishment of the TRM programme as: \u0093the reason why the WHO initiated the Traditional Medicine Programme some ye ars ago, [was] to help Member States to make a critical examination of their traditi onal medicine systems and practices and to see what should be retained and adapted to today\u0092s n eeds and what should be discarded as useless or patently harmful.\u009438 This objective is a common theme in documents related to traditional medicine (WHO, 1978b:26; WHO, 1979b:26; WHO, 1986a). However, in the earlier documents the objective is not expressed simply as retaining those practices deemed \u0093useful\u0094 and discarding the rest. Ther e is often a third approach included, which is to disregard those practices which are har mless, or of unknown impact (see, for example WHO, 1978b; WHO, 1979b). By 1985, the objective had been si mplified, as expressed by Mahler in the introduction to the document on PHC and Ch ina (WHO, 1986a:2). This is a controversial mission \u0096 who decides what should be retained, an d according to what criteria? How and why are these to be adapted? Why should the \u0093 useless\u0094 be discarded? Some practices perform cultural and social roles, and have a the rapeutic benefit in themselves despite appearing to have no clinical validity. Others ma y not yet be fully assessed with current knowledge, or treat culturally specific an d not universally (biomedically) recognised conditions. The underlying objective appeared t o be the rationalisation and modernisation of TRM according to biomedic al concepts. Scrimshaw (2001:55-56) discusses the difficulties of determining whi ch practices are harmful, which are beneficial and which are merely peculiar. T o illustrate the complexity, she cites an example from Bolivia, where villagers were discoura ged by health workers from 38 In the promotional notes for \u0091 The Role of Traditional Medicine in Primary Health Ca re in China\u0092 http://www.who.int/medicines/library/trm/who-trm-86 -2.shtml and also in the preface by Mahler (WHO, 1986a:2). 89consuming a mixture of fine clay. Later, these communities began t o show signs of calcium deficiency and increased prevalence of dental caries. It w as realised that the clay had actually been a key source of calcium. Scrimshaw notes that clay is also used i n biomedicine, but is coloured, flavoured and packaged. The cultural relativism used in judgements about beneficial or non-beneficial practices is clear in this case. The WHO (1978b:26) itself notes the problems surrounding the preservation o f cultural heritage, expressed in particular practices when they are judged agai nst western biomedical standards. For example; in Mexico, traditional birth attendan ts were discouraged by biomedical practitioners from dressing umbilical cords with spiders \u0092 webs as it was considered dirty and harmful. It was later discovered that the sal iva of spiders and their cobwebs had antibiotic properties. Caution was therefore advoca ted and the cultural context fully taken into account when determining which practices are g rouped within these categories (WHO, 1978b:26). The political motivations for the establishment of this program me were questioned by Singer (1988:9) and Velimirovic (1992). Singer alleges that the promotion of TRM and the establishment of the programme itself was a personal vehicle by the then Deputy Director General (Lambo) to promote his candidacy for the position of Director G eneral. As one of the experts participating in the \u0093consultation group\u0094 on TRM, co nvened by Lambo in 1976, Singer perhaps had more insight into the programmes genesis and object ives than other commentators. He asserts that in personal conversations with Lam bo and other WHO staff, \u0093it became clear that at least part of the motivation for the [TRM] Program included the hope that by appealing to the national pride and traditional cultural iden tity of the Third World Health Assembly delegates, he could promote his own candidacy\u0094 (1988:9) . Velimirovic also makes reference to political motivations in the f ormation of the TRM Programme, and was also intimately familiar with internal WHO op erations, as he held positions as Director of the Communicable Diseases Unit in th e WHO Regional Office for Europe, and worked in various capacities with the WHO in d ifferent regions. The heavy political influence of some Chinese authorities is obvious. One has to remember that it was the Chinese Assistant Director of WHO who presse d for [its establishment], which he obtained as a concession in the period of political r approchement with his country (Velimirovic, 1992:76). Lambo did take an active role in the TRM activities of the WHO \u0096 he was a member of the Headquarters Working Group, and also took part in the meeting that produc ed Technical Report 622: The Promotion and Development of Trad itional Medicine (1978b). Regardless 90of any personal motives that may have been attached to the agenda of pro moting TRM, Lambo and/or the Chinese Assistant Director appear to have played the role that Kingdon (1984) describes as policy entrepreneur . The mission of the entrepreneur is to exploit openings in the problem or politics streams to push their favoured policy onto the agenda. In the 1970s, both streams presented opportunities to raise the profile of TRM on the health care agenda. In January 1979, the Director-General provided a report to the Exe cutive Board on the progress of the TRM Programme. The Board, \u0093conscious of the need for pr actical and effective measures to promote and develop research\u0094 in TRM and acknowl edging that the success of this programme relied upon the active involvement of the membe r states, requested that efforts be intensified to promote the participati on of countries in the implementation of the programme. The Board also requested that a ssistance be given to governments to develop \u0093 more realistic and flexible approaches \u0094 to TRM and that financial and other resources be allocated to the programme (EB63.124). This re solution seemed to indicate that interest in the programme on national levels was weak , and perhaps overambitious in those countries that were already committed to the concept. However the wording (as with other resolutions), was ambiguous and open to various interp retations. 3.3.2:3c) Essential Drugs Scheme The formulation of the essential drugs list (WHO, 1977) was a \u0093bombshell \u0094 and is considered one of the most important documents ever published by the WHO ( Chowdary, 1995:40-41; see also Kanji et al., 1992). The publication of this technical report was highly controversial, despite the apparently benign objective. It aim ed to guide the rational selection of necessary drugs, and encourage domestic production. It recognised that although the number of pharmaceutical products had grown rapidly, there had not been a proportionate improvement in population health. The marketing and promotional act ivities of pharmaceutical companies was criticised, and the large propo rtions of health budgets spent on such products (up to 40%) noted (WHO, 1977:9). The meeting concluded that a list of about 220 \u0093essential drugs\u0094 were sufficient to deal with the vast majority of health problems, in contrast to the thousands marketed and used in health care systems. In the guidelines for establishing the list, c ost was a major selection criterion. When assessing this, the cost of \u0093non-pharmaceutical t herapeutic modalities\u0094 should be taken into account (WHO, 1977:12). A ttention was drawn to the fact that \u0093for treatment of certain conditions, non-pharmaceutical forms of thera py, or no therapy at all, 91may be preferable\u0094 (1977:13). Under research and development, to \u0093hast en self reliance\u0094, one aspect in the clinical area was to carry out therapeutic trials t o assess \u0093the benefits and safety of traditional medicines, including medicinal plants\u0094 (1977:18). The essential drugs scheme was a formal recognition that an impor tant aspect of the primary resource base of biomedicine (drugs) had inflated beyond what was neces sary, and was absorbing more secondary resources than warranted. The scheme itself threatened to reduce access to secondary resources for biomedical practitioners (includ ing the pharmaceutical industry) and restrict the scope of their primary resource base. T he recognition of the potential value of primary resources from TRM also indicated that a n alternative primary resource base may be more suitable in some circumstances. Mahl er was sure that \u0093[w]hatever the outcome of scientific testing, there is no doubt t hat the judicious use of such herbs, flowers and other plants for palliative purposes in primary health care can make a major contribution towards reducing a developing country\u0092s drug bill\u0094 (Mahler, 1977). The promotion and development of herbal medicines could therefore help a chieve the essential drugs programmes goals by providing cheaper local alternatives ( Le Grand & Wondergem, 1989:19). This report was \u0093bitterly criticised by the US Pharmaceutical M anufacturers Association (PMA) which stated on 10 April 1978 \u0091[The] medical and economic arguments presented by WHO as justification for an essential drugs list are fallacious a nd the adoption of this recommendation could result in suboptimal medical care and might re duce health standards already attained.\u0094 They argued that an essential drugs list wou ld discourage the pharmaceutical industry from investing in research (Chowdary, 1995:42). Af ter intensive lobbying from the pharmaceutical industry, which included employing the C hair of the 1977 WHO Expert Committee on Essential Drugs, (who remained on the panel); the subsequent revised report (WHO, 1979a) was reduced in scope and content. No reference was made to traditional medicine. However, subsequent reports only revi sed the list of essential drugs rather than modifying the policy foundation detailed in the initial repor t. The counter- offensive by the biomedical lobby re-asserted the value of biomedica l primary resources (drugs) and their role in health care, which was being brought int o question and from which secondary resources (status, financial support) were being withdraw n. 3.3.2:3d) Primary Health Care The Primary Health Care (WHO, 1978a) approach drew together and r einforced some of the disparate initiatives and principles already advocated in other programs and resolutions, such 92as the essential drugs scheme and TRM Programme. The Alma Ata De claration articulated how Health for All by 2000 could be achieved; with a new form of health serv ices \u0096 primary health care (PHC). The Declaration and recommendations flowing f rom it reinforced and endorsed the trends that had been established throughout the 1970s: the m aximum utilisation of locally available resources, self-reliance, cost effe ctive extension of delivery systems and basic services to meet basic needs. PHC was defined as \u0093essential health care based on practical, scien tifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally access ible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford in the spirit of self-reliance and dete rmination\u0094 (WHO, 1978a). The PHC movement was designed to shift the health care focus from sophist icated tertiary curative services, to prevention and promotion as part of a comprehe nsive coverage, to enable better quality of life. This scheme aligned itself with w ider social and economic social justice movements, and was premised on the development of the \u0093New Int ernational Economic Order\u0094. It recognised that health improvements were relia nt on broader social and economic conditions. The Alma-Ata Declaration specifically recognised tradition al medical practitioners, including TBAs, as potentially important allies in achieving health for all through primary health care (1978a:63). The report of the meeting recommended that tr aditional medical practitioners could be selected as community health workers (1978a: 26) and that the list of essential drugs for primary health care should include \u0093proved\u0094 tra ditional remedies (1978a:29). Despite this apparent approval of the use of two dimensions of TR M systems (manpower, drugs), there was uncertainty expressed about the ov erall contribution of traditional systems of medicine which was deemed to require fu rther research (1978a:16). PHC relied upon health workers including traditional practitioner s, but only as needed or where applicable. The principles of PHC as defined by the WHO are embraced by TRM sys tems: TRM is practical, socially acceptable, universally accessible a nd encourages self-reliance. However, there is one caveat \u0096 it is not \u0093scientifically sound\u0094 in the Western s ense. Despite that, in practise, PHC was considered by some to be tantamount to TRM: \u0093Fo r the majority of people in the developing countries, traditional medicine in fact remains the main or only source of care. For such patients \u0091primary health care\u0092 is theref ore necessarily synonymous with traditional medicine\u0094 (Maclean & Bannerman, 1982:1815). PHC appeare d to offer the promise of being the most suitable method for the implementation o f TRM strategies. 93 The emphasis on community participation and self determinatio n, with a simultaneous demand that PHC be scientifically sound, can be considered an inhe rent contradiction within the PHC model (Welsch, 1986). This calls for the \u0093bottom-up\u0094 development o f health services, yet is structured as a \u0093top-down\u0094 approach (the expert s at the top of the administrative hierarchy overseeing and guiding the uninformed com munities). That the Alma Ata declaration was able to combine these two conflicting p hilosophies so skilfully demonstrated the WHO\u0092s capacity to reconcile various and often di vergent political and scientific interests (Welsch, 1986:105). This contradiction betw een local autonomy and biomedical authority can be seen for example in the definition of \u0093 appropriate technology\u0094 \u0096 \u0093appropriate means that besides being scientifically sound the technology is also acceptable to those who apply it and for those for whom it is used\u0094 (WHO 1978a:59). Tha t is, scientific soundness is paramount to community acceptability and is the d efault criteria for selection of primary resources. The \u0093scientific soundness\u0094 filter was an effective control over the full acceptance of the TRM primary resource base. As mentioned, without this caveat, TR M systems met the definition of PHC. However, with this biomedical limit established it implicitly gave control to the biomedical profession to determine what was considered appropr iate, rather than the communities themselves. Welsch notes that \u0093scientific s oundness\u0094 as an essential feature of the PHC model ensured the professional legitimacy and authority of biomed icine (1986:105). This correlates with the implications of the WHO policy on TRM as expressed in the technical report (WHO, 1978b), which Reissland and Burghart cal l an \u0093ideological boundary, created and defended by modern medicine Movement across that boundary was to be controlled by the agents of modern medicine\u0094 (1989:43). Again, what appeared to be an endorsement of TRM was ambiguous and qualified, and subordinated TRM systems of health to biomedical primary resources (knowledge, techniques). The ambiguous and ambivalent endorsements of TRM, and confusion or cont radictions in the use of central terms and concepts, were evident in other WHO do cuments. By the end of the decade, some of the practical implications of integration were becoming apparent. In 1979, the introduction to Traditional Birth Attendants \u0096 A field guide to their training, evaluation, and articulation with health services (1979b), a movement away from some of the earlier positions could be detected. The introduction made spec ific reference to two problematic issues: integration and remuneration (secondary resources) (see appendix 5 for an excerpt of this introduction; page 359). 94It was clear there was some confusion as to what \u0093integratio n\u0094 actually meant, and how to apply it. There was no clear definition of it or framework to imp lement it. In this document, it was stated that integration in the \u0093true sense of the term should be avoided at all costs\u0094 (WHO, 1979b:8). This was perceived to be a merging with the biomedical del ivery system to the extent that the TBAs identity as traditional practitioners wa s lost. It directly contradicted the technical report (WHO, 1978b) published in the previous year, where in tegration was explicitly endorsed, especially at TBA level. Integration might cause conflict between traditional and biomedi cal practitioners, as well as alienating them from their communities. Only informal links betw een TBAs and the formal health system were therefore advocated. Rather than \u0093integrati ng\u0094 the TBA into health care, \u0093integrating\u0094 within them the principles of biomedical and traditional practices was promoted. \u0093Articulation\u0094 was the preferred term, as it implies \u0093o rganization in which each part fits into another so built that it functions as a whole yet withou t any loss of flexibility or distinctness in any of its component units or without any conflict bet ween them\u0094 (WHO, 1979b:8). 3.4 World Bank activities While the World Bank did not make loans for health sector activit ies until the 1980s, it began taking a serious interest in health issues in the 1970s. In 1975, a policy paper on health correlated with sentiments expressed by the WHO. To correct th e distorted distribution of resources that had resulted in an emphasis on tertiary biomedi cal infrastructure in urban areas, the World Bank recommended extending PHC coverage, increasing the responsiveness of existing biomedical infrastructure to the PHC worker and \u0093planning the extension of primary care with the aim of supplementing the role played by traditional healers in village society\u0094 (in Doyal, 1979:286). The World Bank interest in health, education, housing and other social services was stimulated by t he recognition that these factors were related to economic productivity and development. Pr ior to this, health expenditure was classified as a non-productive, consumption ite m (Bichmann, 1979:179). 95Section 3: Activity at national levels 3.5 Debate and activity in the policy stream Academics (primarily medical anthropologists), debated the theo retical and practical implications of integrating TRM into health care systems. The increasing interest in medical pluralism, trans-cultural perspectives on health and the incorpora tion of TRM was reflected in journal articles. In the late 1970s, Social Science and Medicine devoted several special issues to it (vol. 12B no2; Vol 13B No 2, 3, 4), and there were a vari ety of conferences and symposiums. Foster (1977), proposed that except for the use of TBAs and mental i llness specialists, approaches to harness TRM practitioners would fail as most TRM sy stems would gradually diminish and eventually cease to exist. Therefore, inte gration was a \u0093moot question\u0094. Foster felt the evidence clearly demonstrated that where people have had access to biomedicine for a generation or more \u0093the battle has usually been won, and scientific medicine is the victor\u0094 (1977:533). Taylor also proposed that TRM would eventually be absorb ed within biomedicine (1976:298) and both felt integration was only a transitional step to deal with biomedical manpower shortages (Foster, 1977:534; Taylor, 1976:298). These beliefs were based on the premise that the primary resource base of biomedicine would inevitably supplant that of TRM, once delivery systems were sufficiently developed. Yoder believes that this na\u00efve assumption that the use of TRM would nat urally diminish as biomedical services expanded was the reason that official recogniti on of TRM was delayed until the 1970s (1982:1851), when modernisation theories based on the superiority of biomedicine were finally discredited and TRM systems experien ced a revival. Insights into the current situation were provided by Good et.al. (1979), w ho noted that the once euphoric expectations attached to the potential of the b iomedical model had recently subsided in light of many apparent limitations, but the demand for biome dicine was voracious. The ambivalence of both national governments and biomedic al practitioners led to a non-recognition of TRM, which biomedicine \u0093rationalizes thro ugh its own cult of science and professionalism\u0094 (Good et al., 1979:146). They questioned whether this laissez- faire stance would continue, concentrating all resources on b iomedical services despite it demonstrating a class and urban bias that segregated it from the broa der population. 96A limited (informal) fusion of techniques and drugs of the biomedi cal and TRM systems occurred at their interface, and TRM practitioners were aware of the disregard they were accorded. While they were receptive to the id ea of collaboration with biomedicine, they lacked prestige and influence in upper echelons of political decision making. A conceptualisation of integration was offered \u0096 it would represen t a \u0093diffusion downwards of [biomedical] care and a diffusion upwards of [TRM]\u0094 (Good et al., 1979) . In other words, this would entail a democratisation of biomedicine and an empo werment of TRM; or a de- professionalisation of biomedicine and professionalisation of T RM to obtain an equitable status. The pursuit and adoption of simplistic models in this pr ocess was warned against (Good et al., 1979:152). Kleinman (1978) offered a detailed consideration of the issue of integr ation based on research from Taiwan. He commented that promoting the integrati on of indigenous practitioners into orthodox medical systems might be acclaimed as a n accomplishment for ethnomedicine in international health planning, but its merit may actually be questionable (1978:82). He considered that the motives and responses of the groups of pra ctitioners would vary. While most practitioners using traditional Chinese medicine ( professionalised, licensed) viewed integration positively, if it meant equalit y with biomedical practitioners (1978:84) those from the folk healing traditions (unlicensed, not profes sionalised) were not so enthusiastic. Kleinman concluded that for the practitioners of Chinese origin me dicine, the proposal was not markedly divergent from their present position in the heath sys tem, which was sanctioned and autonomous. However, as biomedicine was of higher status a nd its practitioners enjoyed greater income and more patients (more se condary resources), the TRM practitioners \u0093have some specific gains they wish to achiev e from integration\u0094 (1978:83). That is, increased access to secondary resources on par with the biomedical practitioners. The only practitioners from this group who were unfavo urable towards integration were those who already enjoyed a high income, status and large clientele. They had little to gain from such change (1978:83) as they already enjoyed maxim um access to secondary resources (material rewards, status, prestige). The majority of practitioners from less professionalised traditi ons were resistant to the concept of integration as they suspected they would not be given equal s tatus to biomedical practitioners, it would reduce their patients and income (secon dary resources), and would lead to taxation: \u0093integration would mean they would be control led by competitors whose interest lay in putting them out of business\u0094 (Kleinman, 1978:84). There fore, the less 97professionalised groups felt their secondary resources were threat ened by integration. However, in some African nations (e.g. Nigeria) traditional prac titioners pushed for state recognition in the form of licensing, in order to secure economic bene fits (secondary resources) by limiting entry into their field and allowing them to compete more effectively with biomedical practitioners (Dunlop, 1975:585).39 It appeared that level of professionalisation may be a factor in TRM practitioners\u0092 response to integration, as this is related to the degree of control they exert over their primary resources. The less professionally organised have less control (and subsequently only tenuous access to secondary resources) and therefore more to fear from state regulation. However, partially professionalised groups may enhance their acce ss to secondary resources through integration. Ironically, the highly professionalised group s (both TRM and biomedical) were also resistant to integration, as this would mean sharing access to their existing secondary resources (financial rewards, status).40 Economic and professional competition may therefore be a factor in the antagonism reported t o training TBAs (Leslie, 1980:192), and did not bode well for the pre-requisite of goodwill on both sides for successful inclusion of TRM in formal health care (Mahler, 1977). Regardless of any tension between practitioners, international en dorsement of the concept of integration meant that the practicalities of implementation a lso needed to be addressed. Cost- benefit analysis, assessment of efficacy, and identification of the groups from the heterogeneous field of TRM that were to be integrated were required b efore programs and plans could be formulated (Kleinman, 1978:82-83). Cost-benefit analy sis of using TRM and various strategies for incorporation were analysed by Dunlop. He co ncluded, based on his economic assessment and experiences of some African nations, th at the most effective policy position may be informal recognition as it offered the most benefit s at least cost (1975:585). Kleinman also felt that some forms of TRM may function more effe ctively outside of formal treatment settings and \u0093bureaucratization and professionalizati on may not only contribute little to biomedical care but undermine\u0094 specific forms of alternati ve healing (Kleinman, 1978:85). So, while some groups were enthusiastic, others were more cautious and dubious (Asuni, 1979a:37; Unschuld, 1980:15; WHO, 1979b:8). The difference in respon ses may be 39 Monopoly and license is one of the latter stages o f professionalisation (Unschuld, 1975:307). 40 This correlates with Asuni\u0092s observation that \u0093The traditional healer may feel uneasy about the co-opera tion, or may feel his status enhanced by the co-operation, de pending on the level of expertise and confidence [professionalisation] There is no doubt they feel a sense of competition \u0094 (1979b:180-181). Taylor als o noted that in India, TRM practitioners not doing well fina ncially were eager to co-operate, while those with already active practises \u0093could not be bothered\u0094 (Taylor, 1979a). 98related to who would win and who would lose from such a process, and how the shifting power and control in health planning and policy would affect vested interests and the boundaries of primary and secondary resources. 3.5.1 Lesson drawing from China? Doyal (1979) was one of the few early voices questioning what was later te rmed as \u0093lesson drawing\u0094 (Rose, 1991) \u0096 that is, what policies and programmes work an d for what reasons, specifically whether what had been achieved in one country (China) could easily be transferred elsewhere. Doyal proposed that what China had success fully implemented arose out of revolutionary change and was not divisible from that: \u0093the hea lth policies simply cannot be transferred from one social, economic and political conte xt to another\u0094(1979:288). Blendon (1979) also argued that the health system in China was a direct result of their unique economic policies and could not be transplanted in isolati on of them, and Good et.al. considered it an \u0093open question\u0094 as to how much of their exp erience was transferable (1979:152). In 1975, Geiger commented: Great social experiments, like new species which have ada pted precisely to a particular ecological niche, are rarely if ever directly transplan table from one society (or environment) to another. When technological change is intimately and d eliberately interrelated with social, political and economic change as in the health care system elaborated over the past 24 years [in China] the limits of direct transplantability are n arrowed even more drastically (in McQueen, 1985:934). Doyal illustrated her argument with comparative data on community rural health workers from Iran, India and Tanzania (1979:288-290). There, as experienced el sewhere in the South, programs modelled on the barefoot doctor scheme had been failures. A ma jor factor in the lack of success was resistance from the biomedical profession to t he training of auxiliaries with biomedical responsibilities, even where there were serio us shortages of doctors. In addition, workers trained in such schemes identified with the m ore prestigious and powerful biomedical profession and were driven by goals of personal advancemen t. In terms of conflict over resources, biomedical doctors strongly opposed sharing their primary resource base, which would allow access to secondary reso urces for those peripheral to their professional hierarchy. In contrast, the community he alth workers were eager to acquire access to biomedical primary resources and aspired to t he secondary resources this ensured, but such motivations alienated them from the communiti es they were meant to serve. This situation experienced with community health w orkers appears to parallel the 99concerns expressed by WHO about TBAs potentially identifying wit h the biomedical profession, changing in status and seeking commensurate secondary reso urces (WHO, 1978b:25; WHO, 1979b:8). In contrast, in China, one of the most commented on and distinct ive attributes of the barefoot doctor scheme was the \u0093ideological zeal\u0094 and altruistic devotion they di splayed to their communities health, \u0093without thought of any personal material gai n\u0094 (secondary resources) (Ronaghy & Solter 1974:1331 in Doyal, 1979:288). This factor appeared crucial to t he success of the scheme, as they did not threaten the biomedical professi on and remained respected within their villages. Barefoot doctors retaine d their original occupations and received no remuneration for their services. Therefore, they ma de minimal claims on the primary resources of both biomedicine and TCM (receiving only basic t raining and restricted drugs/techniques) and no claims on secondary resources. A significant achievement of this scheme was \u0093the unbiased integr ation of valuable primary medical resources from both subsystems within the practice of one man power category\u0094 (Unschuld, 1976b:15). That is, the medical systems were not synthe sised and existing practitioners compelled to share resources, but certain dimensions of their primary resource bases (drugs, techniques) were instead allocated to a new manpo wer category. Their manual was based on biomedical concepts, although it used traditional t erminology. This program was carried out under close government supervision with a high level of political support. Frankenberg describes the Chinese approach as bypassing all medical ideologies and reconstructing them (1981:115). Despite the unique political, cultural and economic enviro nment in China, it was perhaps inevitable in that the international community looked to it in the mid-1970s. China provided both an inspiration and one of the few models in using TRM in health care systems. The conditions and objectives of the international community correla ted with what China faced several decades previously \u0096 expanding health services to underserved populat ions, in an environment of resource constraint.41 The dual concerns of limited health resources and heightened nationalistic sentiments (along with social justic e concerns) converged to provide a supportive policy environment for the promotion of TRM. Many countrie s including Nigeria, Zaire, Tanzania, Congo, Guinea, Kenya, the United Republic of Cameroon, and 41 For example, Ademuwagun comments in reference to Ni geria: \u0093All the problems mentioned in connection wit h health care delivery systems and methods in China in the 1950s are with us in Nigeria today.\u0094 These were shortage of manpower, mal-distribution of resources, and pat terns of utilization (availability, TRM and beg an to define a role for it in their health care systems. The model eventually proposed by the WHO for integration of TRM w as considered by some to be a replication of the Chinese system (Bibeau, 1985:943), althou gh this is considered a simplistic assessment by others (Frankenberg, 1981: 117). However, it is clear that the technical report (WHO, 1978b) clearly favoured China\u0092s strat egies. One crucial difference was that rather than training a new category of wor kers for PHC, the WHO emphasis appeared to be on extending the responsibilities of ex isting categories of TRM manpower (e.g. TBAs). This support for the unique paradigm developed by China came despite the doubts expressed about transferability of policy models; the evidence of fail ure in other countries adopting community health worker schemes; and ironically at a time w hen the Chinese government itself appeared to have abandoned such an integration strategy. Singer notes that in the post- Mao period (after 1976) \u0093the Ministry of Health and the China Medical Association were shovelling the traditional medicine camel out of the health tent\u0094 (1988: 9). While this may be overstating the case, evidence suggests that TCM wa s being relegated to an ancillary position in formal health care at the same time th e international community seized on it as an innovation. By the 1960s, although integration was sti ll advocated, it appeared that TCM had been relegated to a \u0093supplementary and inferi or position\u0094 (Croizier, 1976:350). Similarly, the commune system central to the o rganisation of PHC was dismantled in 1978, ironically the same year that PHC was endorsed o n an international level (Huang 1988 in Macdonald, 1992:19). The enthusiasm and support for the conce pt of integration as an ideal may have been greater internation ally than at country level in the South: Most of the vocal and strong proponents of the idea of integrating tradition al healing practice into the health care delivery are foreigners to the situa tion. The knowledgeable and sincere indigenes of the developing countries are usually cautiou s in advocating such integration (Asuni, 1979a:33). Why did the WHO enthusiastically promote a particular form of i ntegration of TRM as a promising method to achieve HFA by 2000? Singer (1988) argues that the WHO uncrit ically accepted the propaganda presented by China during the Cultural Revoluti on, and that it was a misguided strategy pushed by Lambo as part of his efforts to secur e the post of Director- General. Velimirovic also mentions personal political ambitions wi thin the WHO as a 101driving force behind the endorsement of the concept, and the polit ically motivated promotion by China (Velimirovic, 1992:76). According to Elling (1981a:87), quoting a 1973 WHO study, the WHO seemed to want to believe or hope that the relationship between political conditions and organisation of health systems was remote: \u0093this link between health service and poli tical structure is not so intimate that the health services cannot change separately and indepe ndently within most socio-political systems.\u0094 As will be explored in the next cha pter, this naivety, optimism or lack of knowledge had consequences in implementation of the policy i n the following decade \u0096 when it became obvious that transferring the PHC concept (and re lated goal of integration of TRM) to national levels, was fraught with obstacles. 3.6 Conclusion During the 1970s, an international consensus appeared to develop that the uni versal policy model exported during colonial expansion based on biomedical primar y resources (drugs, techniques, facilities, knowledge) was ineffective and costly. In t he South, it was not meeting basic health needs and even in the North, its failings were becomi ng evident. This new perspective was expressed in the Alma Ata declaration, PHC, an d the recognition of TRM. These commitments aimed to reorientate health care from a te chnologically intensive, tertiary focus to community based health care programmes. Improvi ng access to and equity of health care services was crucial to achieve the humanitar ian global commitment to \u0093health for all by the year 2000\u0094. These new directions in health policy mirrored broader social, economic and political trends in the politics and problems streams . They were an aspect of the re-evaluation of the values and outcomes of the \u0093modernisation\u0094 campaign, and reflected the new awareness of resource constraints. The continuing expansion of biomedical delivery sy stems and their appropriateness in meeting health care needs of populations in th e South was critically examined in this light, and new solutions were sought. The new ori entation also reflected the rising demand for self determination and independence amongst previo usly colonised countries, which embraced and promoted their own heritages and ca lled for greater control over national matters. These broader trends permeated the WHO, which greatly changed in cha racter during the course of the decade. From the mid-late 1960s, countries from the South w ere able to 102influence the agenda of the World Health Assembly. \u0093 newly inde pendent states joined the Organisation (and) grew more confident in drawing issues of concer n to them, and to publicising their own solutions\u0094 (Walt, 1993:127). The WHO was being expos ed to new concerns and new ways of dealing with them \u0096 particular attention wa s drawn to innovative models and low cost community health programmes like the \u0093barefoot docto r\u0094 scheme developed in China. This concept was inspiring to other countries in the South, who had few resources and major public health issues to deal with. China offer ed a compelling success story, a practical example of what could be achieved when local resources were mobilised and an inventive approach taken to delivering basic health care service s. The policy of promoting and developing TRM therefore simultaneous ly addressed several issues that had become prominent on the health care agenda in the 1970s. In tegrating TRM into health care systems appeared to offer a practical solution to a host of important health policy problems . These problems included extending the delivery of basic health care services in a cost effective manner, addressing maternal/chil d health issues, family planning and communicable diseases, using local resources, and achieving t he new goal of \u0093Health For All\u0094 by the year 2000. In Kingdon\u0092s theoretical perspective, the policy of in tegrating TRM therefore arose on the agenda as it offered a feasible soluti on to identified problems and the political context was conducive to endorsing such an approach. The refore, integration as a solution was pulled from the policy stream \u0096 the politics, problems and policy streams merged. However, the new universal policy models that were promoted (PHC), and the integration of TRM based on the example offered by China, may have been flawed in defini tion and based prototypes that were difficult or even impossible to replicate . Kleinman notes that anthropologists are aware that health policies and programmes are often hindered by the very political, economic, social and cultural realities they wish to ch ange (Rifkin in Kleinman, 1978:72). Plans may carry within them inherent impediments to the realiza tion of their goal, often the very impediments that the programme seeks to overcome (Fo ster in Kleinman, 1978:72). It could be argued that this was the case with PHC and the integrati on of TRM, which were intended to re-orient health care away from a biomedical, curative f ocus yet in definition and design maintained the pre-eminent position and authority of the bi omedical profession. This was most obvious with the emphasis placed on \u0093 scientific validity \u0094 and the supervisory role accorded to the biomedical profession. The use of scientific method ( application of scientific discourse) can therefore be perceived as an effective meth od to assert control over 103integration and PHC by the biomedical profession (Reissland & Bu rghart, 1989; Welsch, 1986). While such details of policy and programme content may appear to be only semantic, they have practical outcomes in implementation phases. The policy activity during the decade in relation to TRM, as des cribed in this chapter, can be seen as efforts by the interest groups to promote their own, and restr ict their competitor\u0092s primary resource base. Initially, biomedical primary resources we re criticised and their validity in some settings questioned. These criticisms even ca me from eminent practitioners, academics and administrators within the biomedical profession its elf (e.g. Cochrane, McKeown, Engel, Mahler, and Lambo). The TRM primary resource base w as then promoted as more acceptable, accessible and affordable. The very failin gs of the biomedical infrastructure could be addressed by TRM systems. The problem stream (lack of manpower, expensive drugs, incapacity to extend the biomedical infrastruc ture, high mortality from preventable diseases) all reinforced the perceived inadequaci es of biomedical primary resources and presented an opportune moment for TRM to seize the agenda. While the recognition of the TRM resource base was politically signifi cant, biomedicine was unwilling to relinquish power or authority. Therefore, only certa in aspects of TRM primary resources were recognised, and those were to be assessed and va lidated by biomedical professions using scientific ideology . In effect, this selective legitimation allowed the biomedical profession to control what was officially recognised a s the primary resource base (knowledge, techniques, practices) of TRM. In addition, the manpowe r dimension of TRM was accepted, but only to delegate to them limited and routine biom edical functions. Therefore, they were to act as subordinate agents to extend the bi omedical infrastructure and channel populations more effectively to existing biomedical f acilities. With official recognition of their primary resource base, TRM pr actitioners had the prospect to increase access to secondary resources (wealth, status). H owever, the biomedical profession risked losing secondary resources and needed to ef fectively guard their existing resource base. TRM was a significant threat to the biomedical grip on status, prestige and financial rewards, but this threat could be minimised by main taining structural control \u0096 as evidenced in the PHC and TRM policies. The use of scientific discour se in this process appeared to be pivotal. The fluid battle for control of resources du ring the 1970s had seen TRM practitioners appear to win some ground by obtaining a place on the policy agenda, but biomedical practitioners managed to maintain structural dominanc e and control in formal health care service delivery. How this battle for resources progress ed in the following decade is the subject of the next chapter. 1044. 1980s: Difficulties transferring policy concept The [Chinese] model was a myth from the beginning, and the international medical profession has never seriously attempted to ut ilize indigenous medical systems to improve state systems of health care, but something ha s been happening that we would all be better off if we understood. (Leslie, 1985a:921) While the concept for integration of TRM was developed in a favourable environment, the seed fell on barren ground in the 1980s. As outlined in the preceding chapt er, in the 1970s, windows opened in both the politics and problems streams to elevate the issue of TRM on the international health care agenda, but in the 1980s the policy flound ered in implementation. By the mid 1980s, many anthropologists were questioni ng the slow progress made; whether the concept was even feasible; and the commitmen t of the WHO to the notion (Bibeau, 1986; P illsbury, 1982; Singer, 1988; Velimirovic, 1984b). What appeared to be a promising solution to service delivery problems wa s extremely difficult to transfer and translate into workable policies. Lack of tangible activity on national levels was compounded by an ab sence of clear guidance on the international stage. The ambivalence exhibited by W HO to the use of TRM was reflected in both programmes (Werner & Sanders, 1997) and publications (Wolffers, 1990:3). PHC, the primary vehicle for the implementation of an integr ation policy, also struggled in formulation and implementation. Many of the probl ems confronting these policies (PHC, and the use of TRM) were shared \u0096 such as lack of resour ces, ambiguous definitions, confusion about central concepts, and the scale of chan ge required in the face of administrative and health system inertia. Macdonald comments that the response to the sentiments expressed in the Alma Ata Declaration as one \u0093not of deafening silence, but of deafness\u0094 (1992:10) w hile Maclean similarly notes that the idea of integrating TRM into health care s ystems had fallen on deaf ears (1986:31). The broader policy context, and activity in the politics stream (such as shifts in ideology, interest group activity, administrative changes) provide a ba ckdrop for understanding the apparent resistance to implementing on national leve ls what had been advocated internationally. 105When Leslie (1985a) questions what exactly has been occurring, the bro ader policy context and the nature of professional conflict and competition between m edical systems provides some clues. Throughout this decade, there were unfavourable economic a nd political conditions for implementation of policies that would divert resources an d structural control from the biomedical profession. These conditions allowed the biomedical profession to reassert authority over their primary resource base (drugs, techniq ues, knowledge, facilities) and deflect the efforts of policies and programmes that would dil ute their power and exclusive access to secondary resources (status, prestige, economi c benefits). The activity (or lack of activity) around the policy of integration can be interpr eted as efforts by TRM practitioners to expand and legitimize their resource base, and a count er-offensive by the biomedical coalition to protect their professional interests an d role in the health care system. The revival of TRM in opposition to the dominant biomedical profession can be considered an example of what Foucault termed \u0093the insurrection of subjugated kn owledges\u0094 against \u0093the centralising powers which are linked to the institution and func tioning of an organized scientific discourse ...\u0094 (Foucault 1980:81, 84 in Cohen, 1989:169). This insurrection of local, marginalised beliefs and knowledge systems against the hegem onic biomedical discourse, and the conflict and ambivalence generated, is clearly ex pressed in international and national policy and programme development on TRM throughout the 1980s. Section 1: Policy context 4.1 The broader policy context While grand schemes like PHC and \u0093Health For All\u0094 were concei ved in the idealistic 1970s, they were \u0093implemented in the resource-constrained 1980s, a period dominated by neo- liberal political and economic thinking\u0094 (Walt, 2001:684). During this decade, severe economic constraints were experienced world wide \u0096 recession, h igh levels of unemployment and an international debt crisis. The global recession c aused interest rate rises, and countries in the South were saddled with impossi bly high interest repayments on loans from the World Bank. In the 1970s, many of these countries had borr owed heavily to finance industrialisation efforts, and were now faced with mounting debts. Mexico defaulted on interest payments in 1982, and throughout the remainder of the decade, much of Latin America and Africa were caught up in spiralling inflation, rece ssion and political conflict (Krieger, 1993:438-439). 1064.1.1 Global recession Widespread economic difficulties created conditions that enabled ne o-liberal economic theory to gain ground. The most prominent proponents of this \u0093new righ t\u0094 agenda were Thatcher (1979-1990) in the United Kingdom, and Reagan (1981-1989) in the United Stat es. This approach focussed on stimulating economic growth through pol icies of economic liberalisation, including deregulation. The social democra tic commitment to a welfare state was questioned \u0096 whether the government should or could provide services as efficiently and effectively as the market was the main issue raised by proponents of economic rationalist thought. The effort to halt economic decline and encourage mark et forces led to an agenda that was based on the reduction of public spending; the privatisation of state owned enterprises; contracting out of public services for private sector management and introduction of cost recovery methods such as \u0093user pays\u0094 for services including educat ion and health. This ideology had considerable significance in Western democracie s, and amongst central and eastern European nations where state planning systems had collaps ed throughout the decade. In China, central planning was relaxed, the market opened to fo reign investment and trade and various other economic reforms implemented. 4.1.2 Environmental awareness During the 1980s, environmental issues came to the fore. The environmental co nsequences of unregulated growth and development became a higher priority, car rying over from an awareness that developed in the 1970s. Pollution, ozone depletion and habi tat destruction were greater concerns. In 1983 a World Co mmission on Environment and Development was established to investigate development-environment connections, and it pr oduced Our Common Future in 1987 (also known as the Brundtland Co mmission Report). This introduced the concept of sustainable development \u0096 economic growth m oderated by management of the environment. Environmental degradation and the consequences of man-made subs tances and activity were emphasised by massive and dramatic environmental catastrophes. In 1984, a gas leak at a pesticide plant in Bhopal (India) killed 6300 people. In 1986, 30 tonnes of agri cultural chemical was spilled into the Rhine River and killed 500 000 fish, in the s ame year there was a nuclear reactor disaster in Chernobyl. The health and environme ntal costs of that incident 107are still difficult to calculate, but it directly affected o ver 600 000 people and has cost billions of dollars to date. In 1989, the Exxon Valdez polluted 2400 km of coas t line after an oil spill. All these events and the dramatic images of their impacts crea ted a surge of concern for the environment, an appreciation of the fragility of ecosystems (Gelin as, 2003:143), and a questioning of the safety and consequences of modern developments ( e.g. nuclear power, deforestation). This growing environmental awareness later fi ltered into both the WHO and World Bank activities and agendas. The problem stream became tinged with environmental concerns and its relationship to health and development, and mo re weight was given to environmental issues in the politics stream . Many of the policies that gained precedence on the international agenda were therefore tied to or reflected e nvironmental concerns. 4.2 Trends in the health field The main trends present in the health field during the 1980s reflect the themes of the broader policy context (described above) \u0096 a constriction of resources which created an emphasis on the effectiveness and efficiency of existing health service s as well as methods for future financing; and a developing movement away from dependence on biomedical primary resources and an interest in \u0093natural\u0094, less technologicall y centred forms of health care. 4.2.1 Financing and Effectiveness/Efficiency Gwatkin (2002:1791) provides an overview of trends throughout this time in rela tion to health policy and health inequalities. During the 1970s and early 1980s, di stributional issues were the main concerns in international health. Concern was focuss ed on the health status of different socio-economic groups within society, with the equity o f health status being a major problem to address. However, this concern was overshadowed th roughout the mid to late 1980s as attention moved from equity to efficiency. By the mi d-1980s, it became obvious in the current economic climate that universal provision of f ree basic health services (as promoted in the Alma Ata Declaration, as the PHC approach) was not feasible. In addition, Gwatkin proposes that the economic and political changes in E astern Europe and China (where socialist and communist ideologies were being replac ed or modified with free market and private enterprise philosophies) raised doubts and unde rmined confidence in state-led development approaches. This filtered into the health field with a questioning of the 108appropriateness of the central role accorded to government in t he provision of health care services. \u0093Health sector reform\u0094 therefore became paramoun t, with the health status of disadvantaged groups less prominent and the financial sustainabilit y of health services taking over as higher priority on the agenda. More activity on health financin g, and a push towards efficiency and cost-effectiveness of services was evident i n policy and programme activity (Gwatkin, 2002:1791). The development of health economics as a field was stimulated by the lack of economic resources available. With limited resources to distribu te, \u0093objective\u0094 and \u0093rational\u0094 techniques to allocate them became more important. Economic philo sophies and concepts such as opportunity cost, demand, elasticity and externalities were applied to the health field. This was an effort to guide resource allocation so that efficie ncy and cost-effectiveness were maximised (see for example Lee, 1983). 4.2.2 Complementary and Alternative Medicine A trend that had started in the 1960s and 1970s gained momentum in the 1980s. Mo re people in the North began to use \u0093alternative medicines\u0094 often based on natural and holistic systems of health care. The use of complementary and alternative syst ems of health care increased rapidly in popularity throughout the decade \u0096 in the United Kingdom, consulta tions increased at a rate of 10-15% annually and estimates regarding practi tioners and consultations indicated CAM was developing at a pace five times m ore rapidly than biomedicine (West, 1984:343). Some considered that the re-emergence of holistic health was r elated to the broader economic crisis that confronted biomedicine, as well as the ina bility of the biomedical paradigm to address health problems of advanced societies (Ber liner & Salmon, 1980b:134). The growth in use of CAM was conjectured to relate to a variety of factor s \u0096 such as concerns with the hazards or side effects of biomedicine, the appeal o f individualistic therapeutic encounters, different ways of interpreting the illness experiences, a rejection of reductionist or mechanistic philosophies of biomedicine, and c hanging ways of viewing the body (Cant & Sharma, 2000; Sharma, 1992; Taylor, 1984; West, 1984). Alternative medicine is witnessing a scene that a few ye ars ago it would not have dreamed of. It has the favour of the media, the public voting for it wi th its feet, and the medical profession taking note of its existence. It is even gaining enough of a voice to begi n to ask questions about taking up its rightful place within the country\u0092s heal th care system (West, 1984:341). 109As the popularity of complementary and alternative forms of heal th care grew rapidly, faith in and reliance biomedical doctors and consultations was decreasi ng. This could be viewed as undermining, or challenging, biomedical professional power and dominan ce (Cant & Sharma, 2000; Saks, 1994; Sharma, 1992). The popularity of alternative therapies was called a \u0093forthright rebellion against the philosophical and clinical o rientation of scientific medicine\u0094 (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:535), although it was st ill uncertain whether this trend was a fad or more permanent social movement (Schiller & Levin, 1983; Velimirovic, 1984a). By the end of the decade, the rising phenomenon of using alternatives to biomedicine was considered more than a passing fashion (Alster, 1989:3). The attitude within the biomedical profession to this trend was scep tical and critical, that it was \u0093a flight from science\u0094 that left some \u0093 wondering if this is becaus e that group stands to lose the most by a change in the status quo of health care\u0094 (Alster , 1989:4). In addition to meeting emerging needs of populations that were not being addressed by the existing curative focussed, tertiary based health care systems, CAM als o offered an option for reducing health care expenditures. Alternative healing treatmen ts may offer less expensive treatment options than biomedical interventions, and therefore their role in health care systems offered an economic advantage if they could demonstrate efficacy (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:538). Effectiveness and efficiency assumed import ance as paramount principles guiding state support for health care, including TRM/C AM modalities. Section 2: International bodies 4.3 WHO activities During the 1980s, the WHO was besieged by financial, political and admi nistrative pressures. The most pressing dilemma was its budgetary position. The budget was frozen in real terms by the World Health Assembly in 1982; member contributions w ere not paid and some withheld payments in protest of controversial schemes such as Esse ntial Drugs. By the end of decade, funding from extra-budgetary funds exceeded the regu lar budget (countries were circumventing generals funding and instead donating directly to programmes they supported). A new Director in 1987 signalled a new direction for the organi sation. Mahler was replaced by Nakajima who was considered a \u0093consensus\u0094 leade r. He steered the WHO out of political controversies by focussing on biomedical and technical issues (Walt, 1993:138-139). 110The WHO remained dominated by the biomedical profession, with almost all senior positions filled with biomedical doctors, and it did not recruit so ciologists or anthropologists (Foster, 1987; Godlee, 1994a:711; Walt, 1993:138, 139). \u0093Consequently, the pers pectives, objectives and interests, not to mention the unquestioned assumptio ns of the medical profession, structure the organization\u0092s approach to health problem s and to the decisions as to what are appropriate policies, programs and projects\u0094 (Foster , 1987:711). The WHO as an organisation was therefore aligned in perception, interests a nd operation with the biomedical profession. In spite of the growth of third world membership in the previous decade, the North continued to dominate the policy process, partly from a shift in balance between extra- budgetary and regular budgets (Walt, 1993:130-131). The politics stream (administration, membership) within WHO was therefore biomed ically dominated, the problem stream (issues for the agenda) shifted focus to internal management and programme concerns focussed on budgetary constraints, and the sol utions ( policy ) favoured technical, vertical interventions and not those th at were costly, time consuming, difficult to implement or evaluate, and politically controversi al. In addition, the senior leadership change meant that a powerful advocate for the radica l reform of health systems and programmes (Mahler) no longer existed within the organisation , and politically contentious or controversial policy and programme issues were le ss likely to gain prominence on the agenda. 4.3.1 Progress on TRM policy & programme implementation Despite international endorsement, various resolutions and e ncouragement from the WHO, member states were slow to respond to calls to integrate TRM in to formal health care systems. Appropriate policies and legislation had not been devel oped in most countries, and practicing TRM was still illegal in some nations. Aside from notable exceptions such as India, China and Sri Lanka, TRM largely remained outside the ambit o f the official health care system and beyond organisational scope. Without any legal recogni tion or institutional basis, formally utilising TRM in health care remained unattainabl e. The promise it seemed to offer in improving health care delivery remained to be realised. Although TRM was in vogue in international circles in the 1970s, it di d not necessarily receive the same priority on the agenda in many countries in the Sout h during the 1980s. The nature of this policy issue and the nature of the WHO itself offer pa rtial explanations to the fate of TRM on the health care agenda. Firstly, TRM and its use in f ormal health care systems raised a cluster of complicated issues that were not rea dily resolved. Although it 111appeared simple in theory and was easily agreed upon; in reality it raised a variety of practical, political and economic problems which had to be addr essed at the national level. For example, who and what exactly was to be integrated, where an d how was this to be done, and how was it to be financed? (Heggenhougan, 1981:98; Kleinman, 1982:1823; Wolffers, 1990:9). Secondly, as with essential drugs and the infant formula debate, the W HO had strayed into a contentious and challenging zone that contradicted its assumed rol e of a purely politically neutral, technical agency.42 It advocated the use of TRM, but could not compel member states to act. It depended upon the goodwill of national governments and other agencies to implement its advice. In the case of TRM, the advice was murky and bu rdened the member states with an exceptionally difficult task. Each country has a distinctive TRM heritage, and must forge a distinctive path to utilising it in health care. Beyond the f act that political commitment and investment of resources was required (both of which a ppeared to be mostly absent in the majority of countries), few generalisations ab out integration could be drawn. There was no common language to share amongst the TRM systems. The WH O noted the unusually slow progress made on national levels, and also the need to ca refully adapt such a policy to individual circumstances; backing away from any blanket endo rsement or direct advocacy: Recognition of the value of traditional medicine is still slow. T he support given by governments and institutions and associations of modern medici ne is not enough. Traditional medicine should not be integrated into health care system s just because it is fashionable to do so or because other countries have adopted it. It has to be i ntegrated into a country\u0092s health system in the light of each country\u0092s unique circumstances. Inaugural address by Nakajima (Director of the Western Pacific Regional Office) at the Second Meeting of the Directors of Collaborating Centres (WHO, 1988:6). Aside from paltry results on national levels (discussed in section 4. 5), the WHO internal programme and policy development on TRM appeared lacklustre. The la ck of progress in programme and policy development by the WHO was criticised by commenta tors and academics (actors in the policy stream ). For example, Maclean noted that the TRM Programme Director was still calling for research and informatio n about implementation in 1984 (1986:20). Most activity had been directed to the periphery of investig ating active ingredients of herbal remedies (Maclean, 1986:30). There had been very little action in other areas. The WHO still placed most emphasis on technical, bio medical interventions and the TRM Programme was not a high priority initiative within the organi sation (Singer, 1988). 42 It was asserted that the technical report advocatin g TRM (WHO, 1978b) \u0093contains recommendations that ca n only be described as involving interference in the inter nal affairs of sovereign nations\u0094 (Velimirovic, 1990 :55). 112While the WHO criticised some countries for paying lip-service to the principle (Akerele, 1987:177), commentators criticised the WHO for paying lip-service as wel l, and considered the policy more \u0093rhetorical than real\u0094 (van der Geest, 1985:9, 10). The role of TRM in health care was given a significant boost later in the decade by growing environmental awareness. In 1988, an international consultation was hel d on the Conservation of Medicinal Plants. This was jointly sponsored by t he WHO, World Conservation Union (IUCN) and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). T his meeting brought together health professionals, scientists and conservationi sts for the first time in one forum (IUCN, 1993:5). They reaffirmed their commitment to \u0093Healt h for All by the Year 2000\u0094 through a primary health care approach that was aligned with the pr inciples of conservation and sustainable development, as outlined in the Wo rld Conservation Strategy. The proceedings of the conference were later published (Akerele, Heyw ood, & Synge, 1991) and guidelines produced (IUCN, 1993). An official statement was released from this meeting, which be came known as the Chiang Mai Declaration . This declaration stated that medicinal plants are essentia l in PHC both in terms of self-medication and national health services, and tha t the rapid loss of plant diversity was alarming. It viewed with concern the fact that m any of the plant species that provided both biomedical and traditional drugs were threa tened and called on the United Nations, its agencies and member states to view medicinal pl ants as vitally important in health care. Plant resources were considered critically impor tant, both economically and therapeutically. All people were urged to commit themselves to Save the Plants that Save Lives (see appendix 6 for the text of the Chiang Mai Declaration; page 360). In this way, TRM became attached to and entwined with a popul ar new issue on the agenda \u0096 environmental conservation. The general fear about habitat destr uction was translated into a specific concern related to TRM \u0096 that medicinal plants may be eradicated, along with the indigenous cultures that carried the oral knowledge of their identificat ion and uses. This new support for TRM promoted it on intrinsic environmental ground s. TRM systems (primary resources) were also presented as a potential \u0093bounty\u0094 of medic inal wealth that may help the broader global community. While the main programme attached to the TRM promotion strategy (PH C) seemed to run out of steam in the latter part of the decade, a new one developed that c ould be harnessed to maintain TRMs position on the agenda (environmental conservation). In addition, a new public health threat (HIV/AIDS), also presented an opportunity fo r TRM to keep a profile 113amongst policy and programme priorities. Throughout this decade, the polic y entrepreneurs and proponents of TRM responsible for guiding it through the polit ical and economic milieu managed to skilfully attach it to emerging issues in the problem stream . Although the reception to integrating it into health care systems had been mix ed at national levels, this manoeuvre managed to revive and maintain the issue of TRM on the international level. This is described below, along with specific developments throughout the deca de in the related areas of WHO activities, namely: 1) traditional birth attendan ts, 2) resolutions and 3) programme development (a. TRM Programme, b. essential drugs sche me and c. primary health care). 4.3.1:1) Traditional birth attendants Some TRM practitioners and practices were easier to incorporate than others, and traditional birth attendants (TBAs) (while still very heterogenous in skills and st atus) were cited as one example. Pillsbury notes that programmes based on TBAs were far mo re numerous than those using TRM practitioners more broadly, and estimates that t he ratio may have been more than 20:1 (Pillsbury, 1982:1827). Green attributes the greater popularit y of these programs as due to the narrow and strictly defined role of the TBA , which presented little threat to biomedical practitioner\u0092s status and power (secondary reso urces) (Green, 1986:118- 119). They usually received no cash payments (minimal secondary reso urces) and had a tightly restricted function (limited primary resources) (Gree n, 1988:1126). Others also observed that they acted within a small sphere of activity a nd their interventions were not \u0093alien\u0094 to the biomedical profession, unlike other TRM practitioners who se primary resources are perceived as distinctly foreign and difficult to c omprehend (Neumann & Lauro, 1982:1820; P illsbury, 1982:1827).43 However, even the acceptance of TBAs was not universal. Velmirovic r eports that some governments rejected the plan altogether as they did not wish to encoura ge any kind of traditional health practitioner (1982:25). Some critics felt such progra mmes were simply diversionary tactics, adopted by countries that lacked the \u0093politi cal power or will\u0094 to more radically reorganize their health systems (Velimirovic, 1982:25). U sing TBAs implemented the directives made in resolutions and the Alma Ata declaration ( to use local resources including TRM), but it was the least controversial and easiest to formalise. Nevertheless, even where small projects were implemented using TBAs, the y usually did not lead to their 43 The relatively neutral status of TBAs in health sys tems (as opposed to other types of TRM practitioners) is illustrated by an example from Nigeria \u0096 Yoruba herba lists and healers participating in training schemes for family planning were identified as TBAs rather than TRM he alers (Green, 1988:1128). 114formal incorporation into health care systems. For example, out of 44 countries where projects training TBAs had been implemented, less than half of those went on to use them in family planning programmes or health care delivery (Pillsbury, 1982:1828). In 1986, the WHO commissioned a report on The potential of the traditional birth attendant (Mangay Maglacas & Simons, 1986). The title indicated the formal use o f TBAs in health services was still considered only a latent possibility. This r eport defined TBAs as a health manpower resource, and reiterated the sentiment that TBAs \u0093co nstitute an important resource that could be mobilized to help achieve the social goal of health for all\u0094 (1986:6, emphasis added). It consisted of evaluations of trained TBAs, and the implementation of various programmes. The report found various constraints on utilising T BAs (such as illiteracy and supervision), and that outcomes and impacts of such s chemes were unclear and difficult to quantify (for example, whether the incidence of neonat al tetanus was reduced) (Mangay Maglacas & Simons, 1986:18). This overview found that it was still rare for TBAs to be inclu ded as an integral part of a health strategy, even in those countries where they attended the majority of births. The reasons offered for this included the logistical difficulty of mounting large scale programs for training; fragile infrastructures; and high recurrent costs which strained scarce resources - especially in times of global recession (Mangay Maglacas & Simo ns, 1986:6). The authors concluded that using TBAs as a health resource was most difficult t o implement in just those countries where it would offer the most advantages. The re was also evidence in some countries of conflict over responsibilities (primary and second ary resources) between TBAs and biomedical practitioners. For example, in Malaysia, activities had to be strictly demar cated, with TBAs performing more social/support functions while biomedical practitioners undertook the more technical procedures such as cutting the umbilical cord (Mangay Maglacas & S imons, 1986:100). In Ghana, some TBAs requested salaries (increased secondary resource s) after training, and they were encouraged to increase their fees instead (Neumann & L auro, 1982:1822). In Zambia, trained TBAs were sometimes refused payment as client s assumed they were now part of the formal health care service and were renumerated by t he government (Mangay Maglacas & Simons, 1986:96). The training of TBAs therefore blurred t he boundaries between the formal and informal health care systems and presen ted issues regarding allocation of both primary and secondary resources. 115Training TBAs was considered an intermediary step in replacin g them with a type of paramedical auxiliary to perform maternal and child health care duties. This implicit objective was articulated by Bannerman, the Director of the WHO Tr aditional Medicine Programme: \u0093Ideally, traditional midwives should be phased ou t of service by fully trained professional midwives working in close collaboration with obst etricians, but owing to several socio-cultural and economic factors, any such hope will r emain futile for many decades\u0094 (Bannerman, 1982:13). Clearly, TBAs were still generally consi dered inferior substitutes for biomedically trained midwives, and their use only trans itional (Velimirovic, 1982:25). The inferior status of TBAs was reflected in this impo sed label (\u0093attendant\u0094 or \u0093auxiliary\u0094); a categorization rejected by a Kenyan repres entative as derogatory and inappropriate (WHO, 1990c:41). 4.3.1:2) Resolutions Several resolutions in relation to traditional medicine were m ade in the 1980s. In 1988 a specific resolution was made regarding conservation of medicina l plants. In 1987 and 1989, the World Health Assembly passed resolutions which reaffirme d the previous resolutions on TRM and urged member states to intensify activities. Both of the se restated the original requests made in previous resolutions throughout the 1970s. They reflec t the lack of progress made on national levels, as well as insufficient funds allocated b y countries, agencies and the WHO itself to adequately implement the resolutions that had been ag reed to in principle by all member States. A decade after the original resolutions r equesting member states to incorporate TRM systems into health care delivery, the same re solutions were being made. Little had been done in that time beyond the rhetoric of asserting their value and asking for official support. The resolutions of the 1980s were less ambiguous than those passed in the 1970s. P illsbury argues that the qualified wording and cautious endorsements of the previous decade\u0092s resolutions was one of the reasons for lack of national policy activi ty in the 1980s. For example, the resolutions were heavily qualified with terms such as \u0093as or where applicable\u0094, \u0093as needed\u0094, or \u0093where appropriate\u0094. These qualifiers were ne cessary to reach World Health Assembly agreement and allowed considerable liberty in inte rpretation. It also meant that at the implementation phase TRM could be overlooked unless planners and admini strators felt otherwise inclined (Pillsbury, 1982:1826). In contrast, the resolutions made in the 1980s lacked qualifiers and were more direct in their requests to member states. 1164.3.1:2a) Resolution WHA29.72 (1987) This resolution restated the important role that TRM systems pl ay in health care and noted that \u0093there exists a vast reservoir of practitioners of traditi onal systems of medicine and an almost untapped wealth of medicinal flora\u0094. It encouraged member states to make optimal use of TRM practitioners and remedies, and to develop programmes to cu ltivate and conserve medicinal plants. The Director-General was also requ ested to mobilise extra- budgetary funds to assist in the implementation of these activities, and inter-country seminars were encouraged. 4.3.1:2b) Resolution WHA41.19 (1988) In 1988, resolution WHA41.19 was passed which almost duplicated the Chiang Mai Declaration (see appendix 6; page 360). This resolution made specific ref erence to that Declaration, and called on member states to take measures to conserve their medicinal plants and encourage sustainable utilisation. Underlying these calls to pres erve and make inventories of plants was the fear that rapid habitat destruction may cause the extinction of medicinal plants (primary resources) before they had been assess ed for potential biomedical application. Ironically, the continuing global diffusion of biomedicine was displacing the very traditions that may be sources of immeasurable medical and heal th wisdom (Zielinski Gutierrez & Kendall, 2000:95). 4.3.1:2c) Resolution WHA42.43 (1989) The resolution of 1989 again reiterated the previous resolutions of the 1970s a nd 1980s and called for a substantial increase in funding if any progress was t o be made. It called on the TRM programme to be strengthened and requested member states to ev aluate their TRM systems; make inventories and assessments of their medicinal plants; explore methods for incorporating TRM practitioners into the extension of PHC; and col laborate in the scientific appraisal of TRM treatments and their application in biomedical health care systems. The resolution was premised on the awareness that \u0093plants used in tr aditional medicine hold great but still largely unexplored potential for the development of new drugs against major diseases for which effective treatment is not yet available\u0094 (WHA 42.43). It was clear that the primary resource base of TRM was viewed only as offering potential s upplementation to the biomedical pharmaceutical armoury. 117The resolutions of the 1980s appealed to biomedical professional inter ests \u0096 TRM may offer remedies that can be used in the biomedical primary resource base (new drugs), providing greater secondary resources (economic benefits, status in treating pre viously incurable diseases). Farnsworth and Soejarto (1985)44 exemplified this stance by estimating the value of a single plant species, should it become extinct, with respect to its potential for drug use. They calculated the value of a single species of plant to be US$203 m illion, and the total value of plant species that may become extinct by the year 2000 at US$3.248 billion (1985:231). The value of medicinal plants was thus presented in economi c terms (secondary resources) and as a potential loss to the biomedical community, as well as threatening the future availability of prescription drugs (biomedical primary resour ces). It was an economic rationalist perspective on plants and herbs, and completely com patible with the broader neo- liberal health care policy environment and dominant biomedical paradigm . These resolutions also reflected new trends on the agenda \u0096 conservati on, sustainable use of resources and environmental awareness. The problem that the policy of using TRM was meant to address was being reframed; from a specific concern wit h the development of low- cost health services evident in the 1970s to an additional problem of conservation of medicinal plants. The cultivation and cataloguing of medicinal p lants was therefore intended to aid their conservation, especially in light of the fact that they may offer sources of drugs for the North and not simply as a cost effective form of health care f or the South. The policy on using TRM was evolving in light of the broader context, and maintaini ng a place on the agenda by attaching itself to current concerns as well as appealing to a wi der range of interests. This strategy of maintaining a place on the policy agen da in the face of competing priorities and scarce resources was also clearly articulated an d advocated by Akerele, TRM Programme Director.45 44 Farnsworth was the Director (and Soejarto an emplo yee) of one of the WHO Collaborating Centres in TRM ; at the College of Pharmacy in the University of Chicago. T his collaborating centre oversaw the development an d maintenance of NAPRALERT \u0096 a database on the chemist ry and pharmacology of natural products, citations a nd review articles. Information from this service was p rovided on a fee-for-service basis. NAPRALERT was co nsidered one of the main activities of the WHO TRM programme ( Akerele, 1984:79; Farnsworth, 1983). 45 \u0093Pragmatism should be encouraged and opportunities for linkages with other interests must be seized. W here agriculture and forestry departments are developing national resource maps, medicinal plants can be add ed to them. Where universities and research and developmen t institutions are involved in the study of the envi ronment and ecology, a place can be found for medicinal plan ts Where emphasis is placed on the development of small local industries, the industrial potential of medic inal plants can be given priority. Where ministries of education are seeking innovative approaches for teaching natural sc iences or for promoting knowledge of traditional val ues, the use of local medicinal plants can be incorporated i nto school curricula\u0094 (Akerele, 1988:358). 1184.3.1:3) Programme development and promotion Throughout the decade, the three main programmes associated with TRM varied in their progress. The TRM Programme, which was dedicated to promoting and co -ordinating the role of TRM in health care systems, suffered from lack of funds a nd poor organisation. The essential drugs and primary health care programmes also ran int o difficulties exacerbated by adverse political and economic realities. Mahler was fighting bigger ba ttles in protecting the higher profile primary health care and essential drugs schemes , amongst other contentious issues such as breast milk substitutes (Godlee, 1994a; Walt, 1993). The two main activities related to TRM in headquarters were th e publication of a book on traditional medicine and health care coverage, co-edited by the Dire ctor of the TRM Programme (Bannerman, Burton, & Wen-Chieh, 1983) and an internati onal consultation on approaches for policy development for TRM practitioners, held in I ndia (WHO, 1985).46 Activity at the regional levels continued with seminars, works hops and conferences; although the level of interest and output varied geographically. The Western Pacific Region (of which China is a member) was part icularly dynamic; organising a working group on the integration of TRM in PHC in 1983, a nd conducting workshops on the same issue in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Korea and Vietnam in 1984 and 1985. In 1986, a meeting was held in Tokyo to discuss herbal medicine re search, and a workshop on training in TRM was held in Manila. Meetings were als o held on standardising acupuncture nomenclature (Manila-1982, Tokyo-1984, Hong Kong-1985 an d Seoul-1987). Publications on standard acupuncture nomenclature (WHO, 1984), a nd medicinal plants used in China and Vietnam (WHO, 1989a, 1990a) were produ ced by this regional office. The prodigious activity of the Western Pacifi c regional office may have been why it was the only region selected to present a report to the meet ing of the Directors of the Collaborating Centres on Traditional Medicine (WHO, 1988:39-43). 4.3.1:3a) Traditional Medicine Programme In the early 1980s, Bannerman was replaced as Programme Director w ith Akerele, a biomedical doctor from Zimbabwe. This was considered an opportune t ime by Akerele to \u0093stand back and evaluate [it]\u0094 as the programme was at \u0093an histori cal crossroads\u0094 (Akerele, 1983). The endorsement by WHO of TRM had encouraged and stimulated i nterest and 46 The report of this consultation was published the same year, but a copy cannot be located. 119awareness, and the WHO now needed to more clearly define its rol e and intentions. According to Akerele, the WHO could become a passive observer and r eporter of developments or take a more vital leadership function. He consi dered the latter course of action preferable, but by the end of the decade the former role seemed t o have been assumed. In the early 1980s, the programme had \u0093stalled\u0094 and by 1988, it was describ ed as an \u0093operational failure\u0094 (Singer, 1988:9). Regarding the need to more strictly define and delineate the scope of the Programme, Akerele made reference to the fundamental problem mentioned in the 1978 technical report \u0096 that of integrating aspects of TRM relating to spiritual, moral or su pernatural principles (Akerele, 1983). While rational-legal frameworks can reasonably regulate the herbal dimension of TRM, aspects related to ritual or magico-religious belie fs represent more challenging problems (Green, 1986:118). For example, sorcery, fetishi sm, divination, or psychic powers are deemed superstition, delusion or fantasy and there fore beyond the scope of rational institutional activity. Bibeau (1982; 1985) explored this dilem ma in relation to institutionalising TRM in Africa. He concluded that \u0093 Western le gal codes are unable to assume and incorporate the African etiological systems and rit ual therapy which expresses them\u0094 (Bibeau, 1982:1846).47 Bibeau (1982; 1985) argued that magico-religious beliefs were essentia l concepts underlying African TRM systems, which could not be simply hived off to accomm odate TRM in legal frameworks. However, in viewing TRM as analogous to biomedicine i n order to translate it to modern legal codes, certain fundamental aspects about the natur e and functioning of TRM have to be disregarded. This position seemed to be the one adopt ed by the WHO Programme, in order to limit the field of activities and also avoid controversy. The main focus of the WHO regarding TRM was its use in PHC, specifically as inexpens ive providers of basic health services (manpower) and also as a possible source of inexpen sive drugs. The TRM Programme therefore concentrated on cataloguing, standardising (na mes, dosages), and evaluating medicinal plants and training TRM practitione rs in aspects of PHC (Bannerman, 1977, 1983; WHO, 1991e:2). Studying herbs is easier as they are \u0093tangible, visible, measurabl e and manageable\u0094 unlike spiritual or psychotherapeutic dimensions (Maclean, 1986:32). Similar ly, projects ut ilising TRM practitioners (apart from TBAs) focused on herbalists and rela ted specialists such as 47 A strong tendency to secularise medical resources and constrict magico-religious aspects is associate d with modernisation (Unschuld, 1975:306). 120compounders, and excluded religious, shamanistic or spiritual h ealers (Pillsbury, 1982:1828). Coreil believes that conflicts about medical authority and power (secondary resources) generated the reluctance of the biomedical establishmen t to give official recognition to traditional healers, especially those of the magi co-religious type (Coreil, 1990:19). Ignoring and excluding this dimension of TRM by the WHO was illustr ated in a discussion on the application of TRM to PHC, when Akerele stated in r esponse to mention of psychic and spiritual healers and faith healing: The kind of objective and scientific approach to tradition al medicine that WHO advocates has, of course, nothing to do with the occult, nothing to do with witchcraft, but aims at the critical examination by modern methods of knowledge handed down to us by the pa st (WHO, 1986a:62) Being compelled to limit the field of activity, we have decide d to concentrate on the study and application of those aspects of the subject that can be explained at the present time. And so, there is much that must be left for anoth er day (WHO, 1986a:66). Later, Akerele more explicitly excluded healers using superna tural or spiritual techniques as \u0093their methods and beliefs are so diverse as to preclude their i ncorporation in any formal system\u0094 (Akerele, 1986:9). The foundation of the TRM Programme reveals th at modern rational-legal frameworks (within which policy and programmes mu st be structured) were unable to absorb specific dimensions of TRM systems. As Unshuld (1976b) i dentified, medical systems have four dimensions (drugs, techniques, manpow er and concepts), which could be structured to co-exist with each other, in order of i ncreasing difficulty. Of these dimensions, not all are easily or readily reconciled. They offer opportunities for co- operation in order of increasing difficulty, with \u0093drugs\u0094 being easiest to assimilate and \u0093concepts\u0094 the hardest. This difficulty, and the resulting v aried acceptance of certain dimensions between medical systems, seems apparent in the scop e of WHO Programme activities. While drugs (herbal remedies), techniques (acupuncture , moxibustion, yoga), and manpower (TBAs, herbalists) were dimensions that were readily ac cepted as offering potential to health care; concepts based on spiritual, supernatural , or ritual belief systems were disregarded. Therefore, the effort of the WHO was focussed on therapeuti c properties of medicinal plants, translating TRM drugs and techniques into biomedical diagnostic a nd therapeutic frameworks, and training TRM manpower in basic biomedical theory a nd practice. The main activity of the WHO TRM Programme was a database on the chemist ry and pharmacology of natural products, citations and review articles (Akerele, 1984:79; Farnsworth, 1983). This focus also may have been due to the adoption of the Chinese methods of integration, which 121strongly emphasised scientific validation of herbal remedies and basic training of manpower. In addition, the magico-religious aspects of TRM were suppressed and s hamans, diviners and spiritual healers were explicitly forbidden (Pearce, 1986:240; P illsbury, 1982:1827; van der Geest, 1985:11). It seemed apparent that concepts underlying TRM systems proved the most difficult to accommodate in formal health care systems, as Unschuld (1976b) claims. From a technical biomedical perspective (as espoused by the WHO), physi cal resources were fully exploitable, while the ideologies/philosophies (concepts) unde rlying their use within TRM systems were dispensable. This trend was also evident in br oader literature and research undertaken in TRM. For example, Pederson and Baruffati (1985) analysed references and bibliographies in relation to TRM from Latin Ameri ca and the Caribbean. Studies related to medicinal plants constituted about a third of al l references. This biochemical approach focussed on botanical information an d \u0093verifiable\u0094 pharmacological properties \u0096 data was extracted and handled in a positivist manner. The second major identified trend was the application of \u0093scientificism\u0094 wh ere TRM practices were interpreted from the biological and psychological perspective of biomedicine (Pederse n & Baruffati, 1985:8-9). This research approach was obvious in the activities of the Collaborating Centres, an essential component of the TRM Programme. The first Centre had bee n designated in Italy in 1979 and by 1981 there were 10 Centres operating, with the first meeting of their Directors held that year in Geneva. The report of that meeting was unpublished. Th e second meeting of the Directors of the WHO Collaborating Centres for Traditional Medic ine was held in Beijing in 1987. By that stage, 21 Collaborating Centres were designa ted and four more were proposed. One third of the collaborating centres were in China. Between the first meeting of the Directors of Collaborating Cent res in 1981 and the second in 1987, the WHO underwent a major reorientation that affected the Tra ditional Medicine Programme (WHO, 1988:6, 9). Although it was not specified what this reorientation involved, a main issue appeared to be budgetary restrictions. The repo rt of the second meeting provided insights into the TRM Programme, and hinted at struc tural and operational difficulties relating to financing and co-ordination. The repo rt gave an overview of the activities of the Collaborating Centres, and it was noted that they lacked cohesion and a common purpose (WHO, 1988:5). It was also acknowledged that the programme had been \u0093held back\u0094 due to a lack of adequate financial support, and assista nce from external funds would be required (WHO, 1988:7). Completion of the Programmes acti vities were dependant 122upon funding being obtained from other sources, and the limited resources a vailable from the regular budget were to be used only in a \u0093catalytic way\u0094 (WHO, 1988:37). The financial constraints of the Programme were evident in t he attendance at the meeting. It had been proposed initially that meetings of the Directors be hel d every two years. However, the second meeting was held six years later and all Directors could no t attend due to cost. The Director-General of WHO had approved this meeting with the pr oviso that regional offices cover the costs involved. As a consequence, participation was restricted (WHO, 1988:8). This infrequent contact between Directors may have cont ributed to the lack of cohesion between various activities of the Centres. The lack of unity of purpose was reflected in the terms of refer ence for the Centres, and their divergence from the TRM Programme objectives and priorities. Al though many of the Collaborating Centres were designated before the Programme had sp ecified a schedule of activities and working agenda (WHO, 1988:9), the main aims of the TRM Programme were clear from inception. Despite that, many of the Collaborating Ce ntres terms of reference lacked essential elements of the Programme rationale (WHO , 1988:12). For example, none of the Centres included tasks on policies and legislation related to TRM or activities regarding supervision, regulation and implementation. Only 8 of the centres included health systems and operational research (WHO, 1988:10). Exchange of inform ation, which was a main intention in the establishment of the Centres, was only mentioned in 7 terms of reference. Clinical and scientific investigations received the most emphasis (WHO, 1988:11). Reporting of their activities also seemed to present some diffi culties. Around a third of the Centres had not provided annual reports for their activities of the yea r before, and those that had sometimes provided unnecessary or unusable material. The repor ts were not used as a medium of communication, and were not even distributed between the Centres (WHO, 1988:14). The need for a common frame of reference to guide all activiti es, directly related to the Programmes objectives, led to the meeting discussing and a greeing on a medium term programme of work. The report was supplemented with an appendix de tailing the global medium term programme of traditional medicine (WHO, 1988:29-38). This programme proposed activities for 1990-1995, and detailed the curre nt status of the TRM Programme. Considering the resource constraints, the propose d activities of the Programme were ambitious. They involved expanding the network of Col laborating Centres, increasing training for both TRM and biomedical practitioners and i ncorporating useful TRM 123practices into health care delivery systems. Evaluating progress on national levels was to be restricted to a set of \u0093indicator countries\u0094 rather than asking each country and their \u0093over- worked health administrators to report periodically\u0094 (WHO, 1988:37). These countries were basically self-selected, as the nominated group were those that h ad voluntarily participated in the inter-regional seminar on the role of TRM in PHC in China (WHO, 1986a). This may have been an administrative acknowledgement that interest on nation al levels was variable, and countries could not be requested to participate and report on wh at was essentially an optional exercise. This illustrates that the problem stream on an international level (which identified health systems development in the South as a crucial issue and the developme nt of TRM as a potential means to strengthen this) did not necessarily match th e problem stream on national levels. Domestic agendas were faced with myriad and varied ec onomic and social problems jostling for a place on the political agenda; and even where healt h systems were identified as problems, the solutions pulled out of the policy stream may not be to use TRM. What was agreed on internationally was the product of independent problem , politics and policy streams , which may or may not correspond with the agendas developed on nati onal levels. While the proponents of TRM could use the WHO endorsement of TRM as lever age on national levels, they were operating in diverse contexts with l ocalised politics , problems and policy streams to contend with. Pushing TRM onto the local agenda therefore required the coupling of those streams nationally; the development of fertile ground and a window of opportunity opening. While this had occurred internationally i n the 1970s on the agenda of the WHO, it now needed to reoccur in national governments to receive individ ual political endorsement under extremely different contexts and constraint s. While the TRM Programme appeared to be beset with difficulties r elating to financing and visibility, in the late 1980s a new objective was identified when i t was realised that the Programme may have a role to play in HIV/AIDS prevention and control. The two main areas identified were using traditional medical practitioners for health education, counselling and support; and investigating traditional remedies for anti-vir al or immunity enhancing properties (WHO, 1988:33). A new health issue had arisen in the problem stream \u0096 one that biomedical primary resources were finding difficult to combat. Fra gile biomedical infrastructures in developing countries threatened to be engulf ed with the consequences of the AIDS epidemic. In addition, many people with AIDS were seekin g out and using TRM remedies in a quest to treat the condition. 124Therefore the policy of officially incorporating TRM into health ca re was given an additional problem to enhance and maintain its profile on the agenda \u0096 preventing and/or tre ating HIV/AIDS. This situation bore a resemblance to the mission of the previous decade, that of fertility regulation and family planning. In both cases, seemingly insurmountable problems with grave economic and social consequences (which biomed ical resources alone could not adequately tackle), were attached to the TRM agenda. Both he alth issues required education and counselling efforts, as well as affordable and accessibl e drugs that may potentially be yielded from the plant kingdom \u0096 using ethnomedical knowledge to guide selection a nd evaluation.48 By the end of the decade, HIV/AIDS had become a major agenda item and was absorbing increasing funding in efforts to combat it. Several consultati ons were held in the latter part of the decade on AIDS and the use of TRM. The TRM Programme aligned itsel f with the Global Programme on AIDS, a high profile and well funded project. T hey jointly hosted a conference in Botswana on using TRM practitioners in AIDS educat ion and prevention programmes (WHO, 1990c). In addition two consultations were held on cli nical evaluations of TRM remedies for anti-HIV activities (WHO, 1989b, 1990b). The report of the consultation on using TRM practitioners in AIDS p rogrammes contained country profiles from 8 African countries, which provided a descript ion of current government policy and practice regarding TRM (WHO, 1990c:31-47). These stat us reports reveal the gap between the internationally endorsed concept of using T RM in health care systems, and the context on national levels. For example, in Ca meroon, practising TRM was still illegal although practitioners were forming professional ass ociations to lobby the government (WHO, 1990c:33). In Ethiopia, clinical toxicity testing on TRM remedies had to be abandoned because a TRM practitioner would not allow anything to be done t o remedies out of his sight; and an agreement between TRM practitioners a nd a research committee was automatically rejected by some as they would have to disclose the contents of their remedies (WHO, 1990c:37). Secrecy was a technique employed by TRM practitione rs to guard access to their primary resources, and the secondary resource benefits that flowed from that exclusive control. 48 Another example of resorting to TRM to address a ma jor health issue not effectively treated by biomedic ine is that of cancer. Between 1956-1981, 32 000 species of flo wering plants were randomly collected and tested fo r anti- tumour activity by the US government. Although millio ns of dollars were spent, none were pursued further and the low yield was potentially attributed to a lack of reg ard to TRM information. A European pharmaceutical c ompany later developed a product based on information deriv ed from this project (about the American Indians use of a specific plant for treating skin cancer). This prog ramme was later revived and botanists instructed to u se ethnomedical information to guide their selection (Bannerman, 1982:12; WHO, 1989b:5). 125The advent of the AIDS epidemic provided an impetus to collaborativ e biomedical-TRM efforts, and a renewal of support for its use in PHC as it refocus ed interest on treatment and prevention of communicable diseases at the community level. However, t he consultation on using TRM practitioners in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment (WH O, 1990c) exposed deficiencies on national levels to implementing such programs inclu ding legal, conceptual and financial barriers. The review of the situation in various coun tries also revealed the marked divergences in approaches and progress made between co untries \u0096 often related to political, cultural and economic factors. The implementatio n of TRM programs and policy on national levels is detailed in section 4.5. 4.3.1:3b) Essential Drugs Scheme The concept of essential drugs eventually fared more favourabl y as a WHO policy objective despite strong initial resistance from biomedical interest groups and variable success in implementation. The scheme expanded in scope throughout the decade. An Action Programme on Essential Drugs was established in 1981 (known as the Drug Action Programme, or DAP) and the focus moved from the selection, to the us e of essential drugs and national drug policies more broadly (Reich, 1987:43). This shi ft in emphasis may have helped it achieve greater acceptance to an initially hostile bi omedical coalition, particularly the powerful and vocal pharmaceutical lobby (Chowdary, 1995; Kanji et a l., 1992). In contrast to the TRM Programme, the Drug Action Programme almos t doubled in size in terms of staff and budget between 1982 and 1987 and by the middle of the decade over 80 countries had adopted the model (Reich, 1987:44). The very features of t he global environment that retarded the expansion and adoption of TRM (such as econom ic recession and the debt crisis which put extreme pressure on health budgets) were cond ucive to cost- effective measures such as those promoted by the essential drugs s cheme (Reich, 1987:47- 48). Mahler strongly advocated the concept and brought the programme direct ly into his own office in 1983, giving it a higher profile and symbolic support (Walt & Harnm eijer, 1992:45). In 1985, partly in response to the essential drugs scheme, the Uni ted States withheld contributions to the regular budget \u0096 the US was the home to 11 of the 18 l argest drug companies (Godlee, 1994a). This powerful lobby group strongly resis ted the notion of essential drugs primarily because it greatly reduced and restrict ed the number of drugs that would be sold in the market. The concept reduced exorbitant cost burdens for 126pharmaceuticals in developing countries but restricted profit maki ng opportunities (secondary resources): An innovative minority conceives of the world\u0092s technology , raises most of the world\u0092s food and produces most of the world\u0092s goods. This minority is be ing challenged by a hostile majority For this year and next, 70% of WHOs budget will be paid fo r by 13 industrialized countries. Certainly this entitles the i ndustrialized world to stand up to WHO. We must have the will to do so (in Lee, 1997:43). While the essential drugs scheme ran into its own problems and dif ficulties in implementation (Chowdary, 1995; Kanji et al., 1992) , in relation to the TRM programme its direct linkage became weak. Their relationship was perhaps over shadowed by the controversies essential drugs became embroiled in, and the nec essity of the WHO to strongly push for its adoption. The policy of essential drugs absorbed greate r organisational resources and political energy. TRM and its relationship to essential drugs , in terms of producing cheap alternatives to pharmaceuticals or reducing dependency on bi omedical drugs, were not strongly advocated in the WHO despite recognising that it may be a cost effective solution: The economic crises that many developing countries are fac ing today may well lead to severe shortages of certain modern drugs and products at the periphery, there by forcing more people to make use of traditional medicine, whether this is governm ent policy or not (Akerele in WHO, 1986a:75). The relationship between TRM and essential drugs was not explicit ly mentioned in the policy documents prepared by the WHO throughout the decade, even though the us e of TRM for essential drugs was an original goal in the selection of e ssential drugs (WHO, 1977:18). It was only indirectly hinted at, and the main focus of TRM usage w as in the PHC sphere. This was regardless of the realities acknowledged that importing al l required pharmaceuticals was beyond the capacity of impoverished nations and t hat most lacked the industry to produce essential drugs domestically. This potenti al for self reliance in production, and tapping of the resources of TRM for essential drugs wa s a clear threat to the biomedical coalition as it reduced the reliance on commerciall y produced drugs. By the end of the decade, the need to produce such drugs locally and use traditional knowledge was reiterated not simply as a cost saving measure but as one of cultur al sensitivity: However, medicinal plants should not be valued solely bec ause of the possibility that they offer for import substitution, but because traditional me dicine is an avenue for greater self- reliance, based on appropriate technology in accordance w ith a country\u0092s cultural heritage and national resources (WHO, 1991e:3). As the essential drugs programme failed to adequately deliver re quired pharmaceuticals at low cost on national levels (see Vogel & Stephens, 1989), TRM filled the gap in sometimes 127inventive ways. Counterfeit biomedical drugs were being produced in some countries by TRM practitioners keen to take advantage of loopholes in existing l egislation and to meet market demand that existing supplies were not satisfying (Chowdary , 1995:85). Therefore, TRM practitioners were seizing the opportunity to access biomedical secondary resources (economic benefits) through substitute primary resources (drugs), t hat the essential drugs approach had failed to produce on national levels. 4.3.1:3c) Primary Health Care The fate of the primary health care (PHC) approach inspired mu ch debate and interest, which has been well documented (Gish, 1979, 1982; Heggenhougan, 1984; Macdonald, 1992; Mull, 1986; van der Geest, Speckmann, & St reefland, 1990). The debate about the concept and implementation of PHC commence d almost as s oon as the Alma Ata Declaration endorsing it had been signed. Walsh and Warren (1980) are usually credited with the origination of what Newell (1988) ter med a \u0093counter revolution\u0094\u0096 selective primary health care rather than comprehensive primary health care. This approach undermined the concept as promoted at Alma Ata, and was ac cepted widely as a more realistic and practical way to implement PHC. Briefly, Walsh and Warren argued that comprehensive PHC as advocate d was not attainable, and should be replaced instead with targeted interventions. They proposed that fiscal realities required the establishment of a list of priorities \u0096 \u0093 a selecti ve attack on the most severe health problems directed at preventing or treating those few dis eases responsible for the greatest mortality \u0094 (1980:145). This rationale was adopted by ma ny agencies responsible for implementing PHC, such as UNICEF. This agency identified s everal main priorities, codified as GOBI-FF \u0096 an acronym for growth monitoring, oral rehydr ation, breastfeeding, immunization, family planning, food supplements (with female literacy occasionally being listed as a third \u0093F\u0094) (Mull, 1990:33-35). Often, the focus was limited t o simply GOBI. These initiatives were considered to be of precedence, and beca me the focal point of activity. The selective approach of isolating particular health issues and de signing programmes to specifically combat them continued the \u0093vertical interventi on\u0094 paradigm that had already proven a failure with conditions such as malaria. Advocates of compr ehensive PHC considered selective PHC initiatives such as GOBI to be the very antithesis of what PHC was, and a regression to the types of programmes that it was designe d to replace (Newell, 1988:904; Walt, 1993:137). For example, while comprehensive PHC advocated a decentralised, horizontal organisational structure; selective P HC replicated a hierarchical 128vertical management. The programmes were run as separate projects , with their own staff, facilities, logos and accounting systems (Walt, 2001:682). This appr oach appealed to bodies responsible for implementation as it confined and strictly defined areas of activity; did not require radical reorganisation of health care systems; absorbed d esignated amounts of resources and was easier to evaluate and monitor. The adoption by UNICEF of selective PHC put it at odds with the WHO. B oth international health bodies were co-sponsors of the Alma Ata Declaration, and had agreed in principle with the concepts endorsed. However, in implementation, UNICEF d iverged markedly in interpretation and application of the PHC approach. Mahler, the Di rector-General of the WHO, expressed disappointment and frustration that a preventative, multi-sectoral approach had been abandoned in favour of limited and selective intervention s (Walt, 1993:137; Walt, 2001:682). However, some considered that PHC as articulated could never be succ essfully implemented, as it lacked a clear strategy, there was confusion about its mean ing and it could be interpreted differently by various actors in the health sector and political hierarchy (van der Geest, Speckmann, & Streefland, 1990:1025; Wolffers, 1990). Wolffers allude d to PHC as \u0093like an elephant described by blind people. Each person interpr ets only one of its features\u0094 (1990:5). The very flexibility and abstraction of the PHC definition that had allowed it to achieve international consensus was its downfall in applicati on on national levels. Using volunteer community health workers to support PHC was also consider ed unfeasible without specific enabling conditions (Walt, Perera, & Heggenhougan, 1989). In the late 1980s, the focus shifted from PHC and how to implement it to t he financing of health systems generally (Walt, 2001:684). Thus, the idealistic notions espoused by PHC were buried under more pressing concerns of cost effectiveness and efficiency of services already established. As PHC lost support amidst the realities of im plementation, the main vehicle for promoting the use of TRM was also derailed. PHC and Healt h For All seemed optimistic ideals, which needed to be replaced with simpler and more manageable technical solutions that did not require radical reorganisation or socio-polit ical reorientation.49 The search for such solutions was the basis for much of the utilisation of social sciences in international health throughout the decade (Coreil, 1990:12; Gish, 1982; Rifki n & Walt, 1986; Walt & Gilson, 1994). 49 The same context was favourable to technical, vertica l, disease specific interventions that clearly esta blished their cost effectiveness and efficiency to be promoted (such as tuberculosis programmes) ( Ogden, Walt, & Lush, 2003). 129 The implementation of comprehensive PHC clearly encountered s etbacks and obstacles, but using TRM practitioners in PHC remained an Organisational goal. Bannerman, who was the Director of the WHO Traditional Medicine Programme until the e arly 1980s, argued that as TRM remained the only source of care for many people it was synonymous with PHC (Bannerman, 1982:8; Bannerman, 1983; Maclean & Bannerman, 1982). Bannerman was one of the strongest proponents of this concept (Maclean, 1986:7), and under his lead ership the emphasis was placed on integration at the PHC level. For example , at the first meeting of the Directors of TRM Collaborating Centres in 1981, it was recommended th at efforts in research be directed to the transfer of results to PHC (WHO, 1988:8) ; which was re-endorsed at the second meeting in 1987. This primary objective of applying TRM to PHC was also clearly stated in the Programmes statement of activities: \u0093In de aling with traditional medicine, WHO aims at exploiting those aspects of it that provide safe an d effective remedies for use in primary health care\u0094 (WHO, 1988:30); a sentiment ec hoed by Bannerman\u0092s successor, who also expre ssion\u0094 of TRM (Akerele, 1988:357). Some observers noted ambivalence and a contradictory stance in WHO d ocuments about the role of TRM published during the decade; and a \u0093sober, more realis tic tone\u0094 (Velimirovic, 1984b:75). For example, guidelines produced on training PHC workers in 1980 wer e not supportive of the concept of using TRM, whereas a reader for health practitioners and administrators in 1983 was (Wolffers, 1990). A revised and enlarged ed ition of the health workers training manual made no reference to TRM at all (WHO , 1987). Documents on strategies to achieve Health For All by the Year 2000 published in 1981 and 1983 ba rely mentioned TRM and did not refer to integration (Velimirovic, 1984b).50 However, there had been a policy commitment made to TRM via the resolutions and the TRM programme, even though internal and external pressures may have led to a re duced emphasis compared to the 1970s. In 1985, the WHO sponsored a seminar in China on their experience of using TRM in PHC (WHO, 1986a). This followed a study commissioned to explore PHC in China more broadly (WHO, 1983). The main objective of the seminar was to assess their use of TRM and to 50 This ambivalence extended to some programmes. When th e Oral Rehydration Programme (ORT) failed in Mozambique, children continued to die from diarrhoea except in the areas where women resorted to TRM. The WHO prevented expansion or encouragement of that, as it promoted the use of home based remedies rather t han packaged biomedical ones (Werner & Sanders, 1997:13 5, 137). The ORT story is another one of stakeholder interests distorting service delivery, and attempti ng to maintain biomedical authority and control in an aspect of health care that could be devolved. 130consider whether this approach could be adopted by participating cou ntries (WHO, 1986a:4). Country reports from participants (WHO, 1986a:54-57) and the round-table discussion (WHO, 1986a:58-66) again revealed divergences between international ly endorsed initiatives and the practical realities on national levels. In Egypt, Sudan, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands TRM remained officially unrecognis ed, and very few countries had undertaken any formal evaluations of its usage or sc ope. The lack of a scientific basis was considered to contribute to it s rejection by biomedical doctors. This meant that TRM systems could not speak the language of biomedicine, and gain the status and respect (secondary resources) accorded to \u0093 scientific\u0094 disciplines.51 Even in those countries with political support for the concept, there w as confusion as to how to implement it and statements of intent ra ther than reports of progress (WHO, 1986a). Therefore, even where the problem and politics streams had merged on national levels (political recognition that TRM may address health system defici encies) there was vagueness in policy development in terms of specific solutions and how to imple ment them. The costs associated with this process were also a factor, wit h the Philippines cautious of the direction to take in committing funds and Kuwait conceding that fu nds were not available to introduce TRM practices into their health care system. In Ban gladesh, it was reported that biomedicine holds \u0093pride of place\u0094 and although recommendations to integrate TRM into PHC had been made since 1980, nothing had been done by 1985. This lack of activi ty was attributed to resistance by the biomedical profession (WHO, 1986a:64). Akerele, chairing this discussion, acknowledged that \u0093Conflicts betw een the Western-trained doctor and the traditional practitioner are bound to occur, in any socie ty, but [Vietnam] looks to science to resolve this problem. Let us use science wisely to t est the values of the past.\u0094 (WHO, 1986a:64). This moderating role accorded to science as a neutra l arbiter and universal yardstick ignored inherent limitations and prejudices o f the biomedical model. Even in China, which had pioneered the modernisation of TRM through the appl ication of scientific methods, the limitations of science as a definitive au thority were recognised: Our aim is to bring our traditional materia medica into the twentieth century, to evaluate it by modern methods and standards, to select what seems useful a nd to discard what does not. However, in doing so, we adopt a prudent policy because of the limitations of current science and technology (WHO, 1986a:44, emphasis added). 51 This belief that not adopting scientific jargon ha d created misunderstandings and made genuine dialogu e difficult was shared by other commentators (Said, 1982:21). 131Two further consultations were held on TRM and PHC, specificall y regarding the use of herbal remedies and medicinal plants. These meetings were joi ntly sponsored by the Danish International Development Agency, and held in Asia in 1985 (WHO, 1986b) an d Africa in 1989 (WHO, 1991e). Their main purpose was to address issues of safety and efficacy in the use of TRM in PHC. A process for testing for safety and efficacy prio r to introduction into PHC programmes was developed and adopted; and a standardised reporting of medicinal plants (herbal formulary) agreed. What was intended to be a low-tec h, resource conserving solution to health system problems in the South was being implemented through a high-tech, resource intensive gate-keeping procedure. It was made clear that testing for safety and efficacy was cru cial, and only selected elements of TRM pharmacopoeia were to be incorporated into officially endorsed health programmes. All of the participants at these meetings were involved in clinic al and scientific testing of traditional remedies (WHO, 1986b:ii; WHO, 1991e:4). However, a criticism made of the 1989 meeting was that the selection of participants had been biased towards TRM as opposed to \u0093chemists and botanists, who would be the ones actually ca rrying out the studies being promoted\u0094 and that the important role of pharmacology had no t been clarified (WHO, 1991e:15). Therefore, in future the \u0093technical and methodological nature\u0094 of the course would need to be emphasised to ensure only suitable candida tes were chosen to participate (WHO, 1991e:17). This scientific expertise demanded and required to implement the process of clinical evaluation of TRM was greater than what may be avail able on national levels (WHO, 1991e:16). The necessity for scientific validation of TRM was linked specifi cally to its use in PHC programmes, and the fact that TRM remedies should be subject to t he same regulation and control as biomedical ones (WHO, 1986b:7). However, it appears that growing commercial interest in TRM was also a factor prompting the \u0093safety and ef ficacy\u0094 agenda, in an effort to moderate enthusiasm and assuage unrestricted profiteering. Th e WHO made it clear that the primary resource base of TRM had not been legitimised without qual ification, only certain aspects that had to meet biomedical standards. In effect, thi s restricted the officially recognised primary resource base of TRM, and therefore the seconda ry resources that could flow from it (economic benefits): commercial interests have not been slow to recognize and capitalize on the potential financial rewards inherent in this official recognition . This has led to a widespread misunderstanding of the Organization\u0092s clarion call in support of its T raditional Medicine Programme. WHO encourages and supports countries to identify and pro vide safe and effective remedies and practices for use in the formal and informal health system. This does not however amount to a blind endorsement of all forms of traditional medicine, as some 132critics would have us believe. There is a common belief that r emedies of natural origin are harmless and carry no risk to the consumer. Nothing could be furt her from the truth (WHO, 1991e:1, emphasis in original).52 While pharmaceutical interest in developing and commercialising TRM remedies was high in China, Japan, India and Pakistan, little interest was shown by de veloped nations in exploring plants as sources of new drugs (Farnsworth et al., 1985:966; WHO, 1991e:2). This was despite the fact that in 1980 in the US alone, consumers spent over $8 bi llion on prescriptions that contained plant extracts (WHO, 1991e:2) and th at medicinal plants remained \u0093virtually unexplored in scientific terms\u0094 and may hold the key to \u0093new drugs of inestimable benefit to the global community\u0094 (WHO, 1991e:2, 3). This may have been due to several factors, related to the nature of biomedical concepts, resources and professional motivation. For example, many effic acious treatments are ignored or rejected if they cannot be explained by the biomedical paradigm (Goodwin & Goodwin, 1984). Singer notes the reluctance of major pharmaceutical compani es to undertake clinical studies on TRM remedies: \u0093How embarrassing it would be to find out that the herb of choice of the traditional healer is indeed effective\u0094 and of course herbs are not patentable (Singer, 1976:17). For most multinational pharmaceutical corporations, the cost involved in research and development was too high, and the potential economic returns (s econdary resources) were not clear or guaranteed. In addition, pharmaceutical interests were notoriously apathet ic to drug development specific to health issues or interests of the South. The clinical testin g and intensive research and development required in TRM remained framed as an issue releva nt to the population needs of the South, despite any apparent fortuitous pharmacological discoveri es for the North that may also result. The pharmaceutical industry had little inte rest in developing drugs from which little profit could be derived \u0096 only 13 of 1,233 new drugs between 1975 and 1997 were for tropical diseases (the main killers of the world\u0092s popul ation) (Bello, 2004). Unfortunately countries in the South lacked the scientific in frastructure and expertise necessary to undertake this process independently.53 52 A similar statement was made in the preface of the report of the 1985 meeting (WHO, 1986b:ii). 53 \u0093 plants will alone give birth to the medicine of the future A revolution needs to be brought abou t so that medicine is no longer dominated by the interests of multinational corporations, which tend to make medi cal students despise indigenous plants one needs the facilitie s of pharmacological laboratories, which do not exis t in most of the countries of the Third World, because multinati onal corporations are not doing any research work th ere or providing the necessary technology \u0094 (Said, 1982:22) . 1334.4 World Bank activities As a significant international organisation, the World Bank is a key actor in the broader policy context. In the 1980s, the World Bank ventured specifically into t he health policy domain. It began lending money for health projects, and produced policy pa pers on health sector issues. This followed a strengthening consensus by econom ists during the 1980s that \u0093investment in people\u0094 and formation of \u0093human capital\u0094 w as an essential prerequisite to economic growth and social development. The Health, Nutrition and Population sector was initially a \u0093backwater\u0094 of the World Bank but increasingly became \u0093a major activity as the bank realised that human development was the key\u0094 (Abbasi, 1999a:868). The World Bank also directly and indirectly affected health sy stems development through loan conditions. Many critics argued that health achievement s in the South were eroded during the 1980s by debt-servicing requirements and structural adjust ment loans imposed by the World Bank (Abbasi, 1999a:867; Rich, 1994; Werner & Sanders, 1997). Health s ervices financing reform was incorporated into the conditions of structu ral adjustment programmes (Walt, 1994:129; Werner & Sanders, 1997:104). Werner and Sanders described the World Bank approach to health policy as undermining the concept of primary health ca re and focussing on technical interventions (1997:107). By the end of the 1980s, the Bank had become the leading financer of heal th sector projects (Buse, 1994; Walt, 1994:128) and had secured a role in setting the agenda for health policy. It also assumed a major role in sponsoring and advising on health se ctor reform, indicating this direct interest with the publication of Financing health care: an agenda for reform in 1987 (Walt, 1994:129). This influential report reflected the current economic trends, and placed financing, efficiency and effectiveness higher on the health policy agenda. It argued for a reduced role of the state and greater reliance on market m echanisms to deliver health services, while later policy documents proposed a greate r emphasis on cost effectiveness as a criteria for determining programme priorities (Walt, 1994:129). 134Section 3: Activity at national levels 4.5 Debate and activity in the policy stream TRM and its role in PHC continued to be discussed in the policy stream (where ideas are generated and discussed within communities, such as academics, bur eaucrats, and interest groups) throughout the decade, despite the apparent contradictions and diff iculties in formulation and implementation. There was little evidence av ailable in the mid-1980s that any country was seriously planning to incorporate TRM practitioners into the delivery of PHC (Maclean, 1986:31). Over ten years after the concept was propos ed, its practical application was still being debated.54 Leslie claimed that \u0093the notion of using indigenous cultural resources in governmental reforms of primary care has not ga ined the voluntary consent of [biomedical professionals] in any country\u0094 (1985b:929). As the PHC movement itself was stalled by differences and difficult ies in definition and interpretation and stymied by a lack of funds (which allowed it to be usurped by the selective PHC concept), the main scheme that TRM was harnessed to seemed t o collapse. The primary focus of using TRM was in comprehensive PHC; an initiative that s eemed doomed. There was no room for TRM in the selective PHC concept. In addition, the use of TRM was not universally endorsed (or even legal in some countries) and was th erefore embroiled in academic and professional debate about validity, efficacy a nd worth. However, others went to the opposite extreme and disputed the use of TRM at all and its assumed relationship with PHC. For example, Velimirovic (a p rominent critic and biomedical doctor) was one of the more vocal and strident opponent s of the use of TRM in PHC. He argued that the ambiguity surrounding the PHC concept led it to be mistakenly conflated with the WHO Traditional Medicine Programme, and its e ndorsement and promotion was misguided (Velimirovic, 1984a, 1984b, 1990). He noted that \u0093(TR M) has become respectable and many authors have started, wrongly identif ying it with PHC, community participation and community workers\u0094 (1984b:68). Velimi rovic launched a passionate polemic about the validity of TRM in modern health care systems and proposed 54 \u0093Lively discussions about the possibilities of usin g traditional medicine in PHC continue, but many of the participants are untroubled by knowledge of the sub ject, while those who know about the problems of imp lementing PHC as well as what traditional medicine really is, have experience in only one specific country or ev en district. Their observations on PHC and traditional medicine m ay differ markedly from those of others. The result i s an emotional and often rhetoric (sic) discussion \u0094 (W olffers, 1990:3). 135that its advocacy was a \u0093mistake\u0094 and an obstacle to the provision of PHC (1984b:77) as well as social and economic development: If the economic development of a country is the goal, the tran sformation of a society\u0092s social structure and of its traditional institutions is a precon dition; in this process, [TRM] is marginal at best or a hindrance at the worst (Velimirovic, 1984b :75; Velimirovic, 1982:26). Velimirovic represented the extreme view that TRM contributed l ittle to the health status of populations, and in fact was dangerous and irrational. He controversi ally stated that while culture should be preserved and protected, TRM \u0093is that part of cult ure least worthy of protection as compared to language, art, music, oral tradition, poet ry etc\u0094 (1984b:66). Velimirovic approved of the WHOs subtle movement away from calls for i ntegration, and a narrowing of focus in research onto medicinal plants and TBAs \u0096 ba sed on cost and utility (1984b:76). The issue of integration itself and the use of TRM in PHC polarised co mmentators and observers, especially medical anthropologists. While the WHO considered that the official adoption of traditional medicine in national health care syst ems \u0093obviously makes good sense\u0094 (Akerele, 1983), others believed that \u0093no responsible or reali stic person advocates melding the disparate systems\u0094 (Warren et al., 1982) and that in promoti ng integration \u0093we are playing the academic fool\u0094 (Singer, 1988:10). Lock (1990:41) was equally scept ical about calls for integration, particularly if the reasons for thi s goal were not scrutinised. Wolffers (1990:14-15) and van der Geest (1985:13) felt that efforts to integ rate TRM into health care systems were pointless, as integration at the cons umer level was already occurring and the interaction between medical systems was be yond regulatory control. This growing critical awareness about integration partly develope d from a more informed understanding of what the process had entailed in China, and the dif ferences between Chinese and other (particularly African) forms of TRM.55 The Chinese situation was increasingly viewed as an aberration; a peculiar policy that evol ved from a peculiar political, social and economic environment (Rosenthal, 1981:612; Sanders & Carv er, 1985:183). It was considered a gigantic experiment, \u0093an act of levitation, a magi cal act that renewed the faith of those who felt they had been fighting a losing battle in deve loping countries\u0094 (Leslie, 1985b:929). 55 TCM was more institutionalised, based on a written history and more uniform in theory and practice. The diversity of systems and standards of knowledge in Africa prese nted more challenges to incorporation (Oppong, 1989 :609). 136This inspiration provided hope for other countries, but they lack ed some of the unique and crucial pre-requisites that provided fertile ground in China (San ders & Carver, 1985:180- 183). For example, an extremely strong political counterforce to t he domination and resistance of the biomedical profession (Rosenthal, 1981:612), and a TRM profession that was highly organized and more unified (despite varied traditions), and a lready partially institutionalised. A range of various economic and social policies were also deemed to contribute to overall improvements in health indices, and not solely the integration of TRM or the barefoot doctor scheme as such (Cox, 1989:44; Sanders & Carver, 1985: 180-183). In addition, there was a dawning realisation that the Chinese mo del subjugated TRM and did not promote genuine parity between medical systems. The barefoot doct or, once championed as an example of integration, was instead revealed as \u0093an e xample of fatal embrace\u0094 (van der Geest, 1985:12).56 Bibeau proposed that African governments looking to export the model used by China to ask them: \u0093What is the actual status of t he \u0091old\u0092 medical culture inside the new medicine you set up?\u0094 (1985:938). The model developed by China was held up to critical scrutiny, and found to differ from what it had been pr omoted as. The eagerness of China in the 1970s to positively promote its own heritage, while reflect ing progress and development, meant that it took some time to more clearly and obj ectively assess what had actually occurred. It became clearer that barefoot doctors were not TRM practitioner s given basic training in biomedicine, but an entirely new manpower category (Pillsbury, 1982:1832; Vel imirovic, 1984b:69). It was considered more difficult and time consuming to forg e relations between biomedical and TRM practitioners, than to create an entirely new c ategory of community health workers (Pillsbury, 1982:1830). This directly countered the WHO strategy as articulated in the original technical report on TRM (WHO, 1978b), where it was decided that rather than create a new category of personnel trained in both systems to fill roles in the PHC sphere, the training and development of existing TRM manpower ca tegories in basic biomedicine was preferred (WHO, 1978b:21). However, unlike in China, thes e workers would expect to be paid. It was idealistic to expect that heath services could be extended at no extra cost using volunteers or TRM practitioners trained as com munity health workers. 56 \u0093The Chinese system does not recognize the indigeno us medical system in its own right. It only preserves fragments from the old tradition, entrusting them to the barefoot doctor. Thus the tradition itself see ms thoroughly destroyed, swallowed by the imported modern system.\u0094 (va n der Geest, 1985:12) 137What China had achieved was an ideological feat, which had b een reinterpreted by WHO in line with its operating assumption of reducing political and soc ial health issues to technical problems: This profoundly political experience was stripped of its po litical significance and presented as a wise and intelligent use of paramedical perso nnel worthy of imitation in other political environments. It soon became clear that that expe riment could not work in other settings. The WHO reports did not seem to have understood that the ba refoot doctor was a political event and an outcome of specific political force s. The depoliticization of that event, however, was in itself political (Navarro, 1984:469). The fact that integration was a political exercise and not a neutral, technical issue explains the lack of consensus about what integration actually was and whether it was positive or negative. How integration is defined and viewed is a political issue. If integration was what had occurred in China, many resisted and rejected it, it as it invol ved the subordinate absorption of the TRM system. Singer considered Chinese tradition al medicine and the WHO TRM Programme as \u0093two cultural gods that have failed\u0094 an d that anthropologists needed to reassess their foundation, interpretations and work i n this field in light of that failure (Singer, 1988:10). By the late 1980s, it was argued that PHC had never b een fully implemented in China and that the integration of TRM had never been f ully achieved (Chen 1989 in Janes, 1999:1812). It is interesting to note that the Chinese themse lves did not consider their system to be fully integrated, despite years of high level government support and the commitment of resources. Instead, the integration process was considered \u0093long-term\u0094 (W HO, 1986a:17) and that fusing the systems together using modern science and technology was a \u0093huge task which will take a long time\u0094 (WHO, 1986a:34). \u0093Obviously, there is not complete i ntegration: it is still too early to expect that In effect, there are now thr ee systems: traditional, Western and integrated.\u0094 (WHO, 1986a:35). In China, a resource imbalance was evident between biomedical a nd TRM systems, regardless of the stated government policy to put TRM and biomedicine \u0093in a position of equality\u0094 and the fact that the promotion of TRM is enshrined in the C onstitution (WHO, 1986a:16, 19). For example, while biomedical doctors increased in num ber between 100-150 000 every five years from the late 1950s, TRM doctors actually decreas ed between 1957 and 1980. In 1984, there were nearly 2 \u00bd million biomedical hospital beds compar ed to less than 90 000 TRM hospital beds (WHO, 1986a:17). It was also acknowledged that biomedi cal doctors found it difficult to accept TRM concepts, even in those co untries with strong 138political support over several decades and a strong history of TRM use, such as China and Vietnam (WHO, 1986a:49, 63). The situation in China revealed the outcomes of different forms of integration. Van der Geest identified two types of integration : one which preserves the identity of TRM (parallel) and one which loses it (integrative) (1985:12). In most cases, it was not clear which concept of integration was being proposed by the WHO but the latter was generally i mplied \u0096 the TRM practitioner loses their unique role and \u0093is reduced to a lowly qua lified health worker in the [biomedical] system\u0094 (van der Geest, 1985:12). Green avoided the term \u0093i ncorporation\u0094 as there was little evidence of that occurring, and instead prefer red the terms collaboration or co-operation (1988:1126). Others asserted that integration must m ean more than simple coexistence, given the urgent need to maximise all health reso urces (Neumann & Lauro, 1982:1819). Beyond semantic and conceptual confusion, some considered the scope of TRM presented a barrier to simple integration into one level of the health system. Whereas PHC was seen as synonymous with TRM in theory, in practise it was not always the case. Fo r example, many TRM practitioners were specialists, not general health care work ers. Like biomedical practitioners, TRM practitioners could be grouped into primar y (e.g. midwives, herbalists), or tertiary Yoder, 1982:1853). used by some to c laim that TRM should not be automatically restricted to the PHC sector alone (Bib eau, 1985:941; Kikhela, Bibeau, & Corin, 1981:99). While commentators were polarised on the official place of TRM i n the health sphere, it amounted to a de-facto alliance that converged on suspicion, cautio n or opposition to the concept \u0096 for widely different reasons. While some felt that it shoul d be protected and thus kept out of \u0093the clutches\u0094 of biomedicine and the formal health sphere ( van der Geest, 1985:12), some felt (or hoped) it should be eradicated, offered little benefit or would eventually disappear and thus deserved no formal recognition (Velimir ovic, 1984a, 1984b; Velimirovic, 1982). Others were more neutral and sought information on costs, benefits and methods of integration before concluding on its merits (Kl einman, 1984). Therefore, there was a lack of cohesiveness in the international an d national policy and politics streams , in terms of how to integrate TRM and whether this was feasibl e or warranted. Unlike what had occurred in China, where there was co nsensus and clear integration strategy in the policy stream bound by a common political ideology; elsewhere 139the policy and politics streams were fragmented \u0096 pulled in different directions by different actors with different interests and pursuing different goals. This divisiveness and debate created a vacuum in which little activity occurred. The devel opment of low-cost health services was still assessed and analysed \u0096 with political will, economic and cultural factors and other inputs such as education, sanitation, and water supply deter mined to be necessary aspects. China, Costa Rica Kerala state (India) and Sri Lanka re mained tangible proof that such services could be developed (Halstead, Walsh, & Warren, 1985) al though broader transfer remained elusive. 4.5.1 National level implementation Velimirovic\u0092s ideological stance of promoting and supporting a narrow focus in research onto medicinal plants and TBAs, based on cost and utility (1984b:76) arti culated what seemed to be occurring in practise on national levels. Ambivalence about the role of TRM in nations that were focussed on modernisation and economic growth see med apparent; and a constriction of research and activity to limited dimensions of T RM systems (phytotherapy and TBAs) was evident. The reluctance to fully embrace and i ncorporate TRM into health care delivery systems (even in countries that had enthusiastic ally endorsed the concept in WHO resolutions and meetings) was the result of a combination of p olitical, economic and social factors that frustrated implementation. This amalga m of factors varied between countries, but resulted in an almost universal glacial pace of progre ss on national levels. Issues related to the state, as well as antagonistic competit ion within and between TRM and biomedical practitioners all acted to create a stalemate. Mainta ining the status quo became the easiest outcome in the face of the conflicting pressures. The high level of activity in the policy stream (discussions, conferences, literature) was not translated i nto tangible outcomes. Pillsbury considered that only one or two countries had incorporate d TRM practitioners into health care systems (1982:1825) and Green found no evidence of \u0093genuine incorporation\u0094 anywhere in Africa (Green, 1986; 1988:1126). The conundrum remained that despi te national and international statements of support, and the conc ept appearing to offer a feasible and logical solution to biomedical health system flaws; it was re sistant to translation into policies and programmes. 1404.5.1:1 State issues in development and adoption of TRM policy Throughout the 1980s, the lack of progress in implementation became apparen t to observers, who began to question the discrepancies between statements of suppor t and lack of activity or resource allocation (Green, 1988; Maclean, 1986; Pillsbury, 1982; Wolffe rs, 1990). There was a distinct lack of interest in encouraging TRM practitioner s in countries where their existence was formerly suppressed (Maclean, 1986:31). The hesitati on in promoting popular or traditional forms of healing may have related to national pride \u0096 it implicitly reinforced the notion that countries in the South were lagging in medical modernis ation efforts (Coreil, 1990:20). A commitment to modernisation and economic development requir ed embracing Western ideals, including biomedicine, as powerful symbols of economic and social advancement. For example, Ivory Coast and Kenya justified their choice to maintain the illegal status of TRM by stating a desire for progress and modernity ( Kikhela, Bibeau, & Corin, 1981:97). The sudden international encouragement to promote TRM conflicted with decades of \u0093development\u0094 ideology that previously stressed the eradicati on of traditional beliefs, ways of life and systems of operating. TRM was considered an \u0093embarr assing anachronism\u0094 that represented \u0093the backward, the primitive, the heathen\u0094 (Green, 1988:1127). I ncidences were documented where TRM practitioners were involved informally in healt h programmes, but officials were reluctant to acknowledge them: \u0093the very existenc e of these healers was viewed as a problem and a source of embarrassment, and the pr ospect of even acknowledging their independent actions appeared to confer undue positive sa nction\u0094 (Coreil, 1990:20). The nature and composition of the bureaucracy also presented obstac les to officially endorsing TRM. As the hierarchy in official health systems was dominated by or affiliated with the biomedical profession, the interests of TRM were subordina ted and health planning continued to be biomedically driven (Good in Green, 1988:1127; Maclean, 1986:32). Personal priorities of administrators, such as career adva ncement or the augmentation of salaries, also interfered with the practicalities of policy and programme development (Pillsbury, 1982:1830). Supportive planners, administrators and advisors wi th authority to push policy proposals through were required, as well as stable and co mmitted staff to maintain and promote programmes. However, political instability c reated high turnovers and movement of officials between areas or portfolios (Green, 1988:1127; P illsbury, 1982:1829). 141An indifferent or hostile bureaucracy that has difficulty accepting t he foundations of TRM will not have the capacity to adequately tackle the complexitie s of integration. Implementing such a strategy requires an understanding of what TRM actually is , what integration involves and how to go about it. There was very little information avai lable on practical issues such as how to establish programmes or evaluations of pilot projects alrea dy undertaken (Neumann & Lauro, 1982:1820, 1823; P illsbury, 1982:1829; van der Geest, 1985:11). In addition, high level political support that could have compelled administrative acti on was usually lacking. There was little to gain politically by giving the rural masses some thing they already had access to (TRM), but rather by promising them resources they did not have a nd could not produce independent of government support (van der Geest, 1985:11). Ambiguity in legal codes and health policy therefore resulted from the structural control exerted by the biomedical profession and the lack of political i ncentives for integration. Political support for TRM risked estrangement of the powerful biom edical coalition, as well as the wider population who may view it as a second rate trade-off for biom edical services. Introducing legislation could actually backfire, as experienc ed in one country. The WHO noted that there had been little success in African countries with efforts to incorporate TRM into mainstream healthcare systems and gave the example of an unidentified nation that: at independence tried to correct the inherited situat ion by adopting policies and promulgating legislation that were encouraging to tradi tional health practitioners. But, unfortunately, this alienated the medical profession a nd the existing gap between the two types of practitioner was further widened. The lack of clear policy and legislation authorizing traditional health care makes progress towards full coll aboration between the two systems slow and even impossible (WHO, 1988:31). The ambivalence on national levels was also partly a consequence of the sheer volume of funding required to implement a strategy that involved a costly verif ication process and highly qualified personnel to implement. For example, scientif ically screening TRM remedies for introduction into a PHC programme was a complicate d and resource intensive procedure. In countries crippled with foreign debt and barely able t o provide basic social services, such a systematic and expensive programme would be a l uxury and beyond the scope of budgetary realities. Therefore, even in countries wh ich had earnestly endorsed the concept or proudly asserted their TRM heritage, the implementation of a strategy as envisaged by the WHO was beyond their grasp (as revealed by country report s WHO, 1986a:58-66). 142It was a paradox that although integration of TRM was a cost-s aving strategy in the longer term, it could not be implemented due to expense incurred in t he short term (van der Geest, 1985:11). Other priorities easily gained precedence over TRM, such a pro pping up a crumbling biomedical infrastructure that was absorbing far mor e funding than projected. Maintaining existing services rather than establishing innovative new programmes was the basis of resource allocation (Maclean, 1986:33-34). Inflationary press ures and foreign debt interest repayments curtailed health budgets, and donor bodies stepped in to fund specific health projects. However, these agencies determine the sc ope and objectives of the funded programmes, and may not be sympathetic to the concept of incorpora ting TRM (Green, 1986:117; Maclean, 1986:33). On national levels, the constraints can therefore be summarised as : no funds, no expertise, negative and unstable administrative environments, no practical gui dance or understanding of how to proceed, no political commitment and more pressing domest ic economic and social issues to resolve. The result was symbolic policy \u0096 state ments of support, but no resource allocation to match the commitment.57 Hours called this acceptance of TRM an \u0093alibi\u0094 or \u0093smokescreen\u0094 constructed due to circumstances : an institutional alibi, designed to mask the inadequaci es of existing policies, in the hope that health problems will be solved by introducing some more or l ess imaginary dimension This fa\u00e7ade of belief in the virtues of [TRM] costs little and offer s many institutional advantages (Hours, 1986:48, emphasis added). Adopting symbolic policies with minimal and restricted programme activity seemed to verify what Dunlop had asserted \u0096 informally recognising TRM was the most efficacious policy position and least costly to employ (Dunlop, 1975:585). Lip service to the c oncept of formally using TRM in health care may therefore have been the mos t strategic economic and political position to take. It gives the status of official recogn ition to TRM, without diverting scarce resources from the powerful and dominant biomedical coaliti on. It meets nationalistic sentiment while still offering the promise of providing adequate bi omedical infrastructure. It also avoids the thorny issues surrounding integration and how to achie ve it, while the trade- off is that the status quo is maintained and supposed benefits of integration are not realised by any of the stakeholders. However, superficially, all stakeholders a re appeased in the short term. 57 A policy usually has two components \u0096 a verbal compon ent (statement of purpose, pledge and intention); a nd an effectiveness component (regulatory rules, grants an d resources). If a policy does not allocate resourc es it can be termed \u0093symbolic\u0094 (Eyestone, 1978:15). 143The national level institutional obstacles were compounded by pr ofessional tensions between biomedical and TRM practitioners. This friction results from the shi fting primary and secondary resource base boundaries that integration entails . Integration enables rivals to re- draw the boundaries of their resource bases, and to re-establish t heir jurisdictions. The professional attitude of both groups to integration is one of protecti ng exclusive access to their respective primary resources, while trying to extend access t o the others resource base. The goal and motivation for both groups is to increase their prima ry and secondary resources, which presents an impediment to effective collabora tion requiring the sharing of resources. 4.5.1:2 Interest group: Biomedical profession Ironically, rather than the budgetary profile of TRM being raised in nat ional allocations through international endorsement, the emphasis on scientific validation represented a shift in resources from the TRM to biomedical sector. As gatekeepers of t he process to identify, isolate and test active agents for efficacy; the funds required to un dertake this process had to be channelled to the biomedical coalition. To compound the irony, the b enefits of any compounds \u0093discovered\u0094 (biomedically legitimated) also flow to t he biomedical fraternity, as they are then absorbed into the biomedical primary resource base . This has been astutely observed as allocating funds against TRM, not in support of it, as the benefits are accrued only by the biomedical profession: However, the interest shown in traditional medicine, w itnessed by the wide proliferation of literature on the subject, has not been supported with fun ds for action programmes. In many developing countries there has scarcely been any budgetary provisio n at all for the promotion of traditional medicine as a system of health care in its own right. But huge funds have been allocated to fight against it and exploit its knowledge in order to adv ance the cause of scientific medicine (Lantum, 1982:16). Apart from an emphasis on scientific evaluation (that required biomedical personnel for supervision and expertise), and on adopting certain TRM remedies into the biomedical repertoire, TRM concepts were also appropriated to promulgate biom edical health messages. For example, indigenous myths and stories were used to market biomedi cal techniques such as oral rehydration therapy (ORT) (Coreil, 1990:15). This approach was c riticised by Crandon, even though it may save lives. Using indigenous concepts to ensure conformity with imported medical conventions causes the eventual eradicat ion of the local tradition, 144through its transformation and absorption into the hegemonic biomed ical system (in Donahue, 1990:84). 58 This selective use of dimensions of TRM systems (particular pla nts, groups of manpower, concepts) can therefore be perceived as a manipulation of policy by th e structurally dominant biomedical profession, to enlarge their own primary resource base, se cure and increase access to secondary resources, maintain structural strength and increase their functional strength. Rather than an integration strategy that enabled re sources to be directed to and shared with TRM systems, it was instead carefully controlle d and effectively subverted by the biomedical group. Specific dimensions of TRM were in fact harnessed to extend biome dical services. Those aspects of TRM that did not challenge the biomedical model or power str ucture were accepted readily. \u0093However, when the suggested element co nflicts with established knowledge and political structures, opposition is the most frequent re action\u0094 and the scientific soundness of such recommendations was used to justify the rejection (Coreil, 1990:18). This attitude was reflected by the British Medical Associat ion\u0092s report on CAM in 1986, which discredited it as \u0093unscientific\u0094 (Fairfoot, 1987; Saks, 1998:207; Sharma, 2000:214). The biomedical profession assumed a right to arbitrate the cla ims of CAM, on the grounds of their scientific expertise (Sharma, 2000:214). These strategies created an effective barrier on national levels t o shifting resources \u0096 both in allocating funds to TRM (secondary resources) and in formally acknow ledging their primary resource base. Anything that conflicted with the dominance of biomedi cal primary resources (knowledge, techniques) was rejected, while anything that could be appropriated was absorbed \u0096 primarily in the restricted sphere of PHC. Ther efore, the boundaries of the biomedical primary and secondary resource bases were being reinfo rced, using the tool of scientific discourse.59 This was generally presented as in the interests of patient welfa re. On safety and efficacy (scientific legitimacy) or professional a uthority grounds, biomedical practitioners refused to share access to their primary resources a nd also attempted to constrict the primary resource base of TRM practitioners. 58 Using analogies and metaphors based on indigenous health concepts and language to promote biomedical health education strategies is described by Nichter and Ni chter (1986). This approach was described as not lo gical in a \u0093scientific sense\u0094 but rational in that it enhanced rapport and communication with communities. Theref ore, science was abandoned to more effectively sell biomedical co ncepts at local levels (gain functional strength). 59 Gieryn explores the construction of boundaries betwe en science and non-science, which is \u0093useful for [the] pursuit of professional goals: acquisition of intel lectual authority and career opportunities; denial of these resources to \u0093pseudoscientists\u0094 (1983:781). 145This can be illustrated by biomedical practitioner responses to progra mmes that advocated the use of TRM practitioners to distribute or use biomedical drugs, knowledge , or techniques (primary resources). Medical techniques and the use of drugs (prim ary resources) are unlikely to be relinquished by physicians \u0093if they perceive themselve s as being in competition for patients and general social status\u0094 (seconda ry resources) (MacCormack, 1986:153). For example, in Swaziland, a scheme for TRM practitioners to prom ote and distribute packages of oral rehydration salts was thwarted by biome dical physicians and health officials who argued that they could not be \u0093trusted\u0094 wit h modern medicine (Green, 1988:1129). In Botswana, a programme to distribute condoms by TRM practitioners failed in some cases due to lack of support from biomedical practitioners (WHO, 1990c:32). In Ghan a, instruction for TRM practitioners in the use of some basic biomedicines was abandone d due to limited supply. The biomedical primary resource base (drugs) was considered insufficient to share (Warren et al., 1982:1877). In India, biomedical doctors argued against ot her health personnel having the authority to give injections at PHC level, as they we re \u0093unqualified\u0094 and \u0093their own status [would] be undermined and a source of collec tion [secondary resources] lost to others\u0094 (Nichter, 1996:248). At the same time, the primary resource base of TRM was attacked as be ing detrimental to public health, or at least as potentially dangerous.60 This approach was strengthened by combining it with the new emphasis on economic appraisals, and cont rasting TRM effectiveness and efficiency with biomedicine \u0096 most cle arly expressed by Warren, an architect of the selective PHC approach: Another key question is the relative effectiveness of mode rn versus traditional technologies. Evans noted that the use of chemotherapy for tuberculosis for bla cks in New York City and Maoris in New Zealand has shown that advances in medical t echnology can be very effective in reducing mortality promptly without any preceding im provements in living standards In contrast, Nyazema in his paper entitled \u0091Herbal toxicity i n Zimbabwe\u0092 reported high mortality rates from poisoning due to traditional remed ies in hospitals in Africa none of the traditional healers interviewed believed in documenting their pr actice, but 90% were aware that some of their remedies were toxic (Warren, 1988:896). Undoubtedly, some of the techniques criticised were dangerous, such a s giving herbal enemas to treat diarrhoea (Green, 1988:1127), uvulectomy to treat coughs an d colds (Bai, 60 \u0093There is a common belief that remedies of natural origin are harmless and carry no risk to the consum er. Nothing could be further from the truth \u0093 (WHO, 1991e:1). 1461985), nutritional taboos during pregnancy (Sood & Kapil, 1984) or using cow dung on umbilical stumps (Velimirovic, 1990:56). However, the over-emphasis on detrimental impacts of TRM medicines or techniques neglected the fact that it was unclear whether the harm caused from such treatments was equivalent to or greater th an the estimated 20% of all illnesses due to the iatrogenic impact of biomedicine (Heggenhougan , 1981:97). To place this in perspective, Bodeker noted that in the United States in 1989, plant poisonings were almost all due to the consumption of toxic ornamenta l plants and resulted in 1 fatality, whereas in the same year non-suicide deaths from a small group of pharmaceuticals was 414 (Bodeker, 1994b:14). The biomedical focus on TRM as dan gerous superstition, myth and irrational belief reflects the \u0093rule\u0094 that \u0093other people\u0092s quackery appears worse than one\u0092s own\u0094 (Leslie, 1980:193; Wolffers, 1990:3).61 The biomedical primary resource base was reasserted as offering the most value t o public health, and as being superior in all respects to TRM. For example, Boris Velimi rovic noted that TRM had not helped in combating a host of diseases such as cholera, ye llow fever, leprosy, trachoma, malaria, or tuberculosis, and had not prevented high death rates and in fant mortality (1990:52). Helga Velimirovic similarly argued that it was out of the question to substitute herbal remedies for the effective biomedicines available, even if it was recognised that they may have some advantages over biomedicines (1982:26). Shifting primary resources from one group to another is easier, once it is recognised \u0093that these resources will be of use in gaining access to more secondary r esources [status, economic benefits]\u0094 (Unschuld, 1976b:8). This had not yet occurred wi th the biomedical profession and subsequently there was very little incentive to ad opt or accept TRM primary resources beyond the limited aspects already mentioned (such as ab sorbing research funds for clinical investigation). The lack of incentives (secondary resources) therefore hindered the adoption or recognition of TRM primary resources by biomedical pract itioners. At the same time, preserving their existing secondary resources led to an unw illingness to share biomedical primary resources or co-operate with TRM practitione rs. Other scientists or biomedical practitioners disputed the validity o f ethnomedical knowledge, and argued that TRM had \u0093discovered\u0094 only a fraction of the known the rapeutic uses of 61 Note the similarity to techniques employed by the biomedical profession in the North to alternative h ealth systems throughout the 19th and 20th centuries \u0096 \u0093 its initial strategy in coping with them has tended to involve a campaign by which its rivals would be discredited and ultimat ely eliminated, or at least greatly restricted in p ractice. Although [biomedicine] often justifies such a strategy as be ing an attempt to protect the public from \u0091quacks\u0092 a nd inferior if not dangerous medical care, it is clear that the elimination of economic compet ition plays a major role in this area \u0094 (Baer, 1981:703, emphasis added). 147plants, and that science alone held the key to understanding and developing phytotherapy (Gottlieb, 1982:15).62 In the professional competition between sectors, biomedical practitioners referred to the lack of scientific knowledge of TRM pra ctitioners (Pearce, 1986:237). The limits of ethnomedical knowledge or medicinal plants (pri mary resources) was stressed, and the advantages of biomedical primary resources promoted: \u0093 we must bear in mind that we live in the modern world and should not deny the progres s of immunology and chemotherapy to populations \u0094 (Marini Bettolo, 1982:18-19). The pinnacle of health service evolution was held to be biomedicine, beca use it was more \u0093scientific\u0094 and therefore automatically more efficacious than any type of TRM system encountered (Fairfoot, 1987; Riley, 1977:549). Polunin reminded the biomedical pr ofession that some of its values and practices were derived from cultura l or social (not scientific) sources, and may be merely \u0093foreign tribal customs\u0094. It was th erefore important to establish they were truly scientific before imposing them on local cultures (Polunin, 1982:21). However, the aura of authority and prestige attached to biomedici ne meant that its universal superiority was generally assumed. There was an automatic link made between biomedicine- modern-scientific and therefore positive, effective medicine; an d other systems as pre- modern, irrational and negative (West, 1984:343). This dismissal of anything other than those treatments that had bee n biomedically or scientifically-verified as legitimate protects biomedical pr imary and secondary resources. However, this rigid demarcation and application of scientific prin ciples risked the rejection of alternative therapies that may have been in the interests o f patients to provide (Goodwin & Goodwin, 1984:2389). This can be seen as another example of what McKeown c onsiders a failure to distinguish between the interests of the doctor and the interests of the patient (1984:107). As Riley noted, the ideological commitment of biomedicine to science may compete with a practical commitment to health, and the costs o f pursuing a scientific agenda may ultimately be negative in terms of health care (Riley, 1977:557). The very rigours of the scientific method that are respons ible for the technical pre-eminence of [biomedicine] are obstacles to full therapeutic effecti veness. The scientific doctor feels comfortable only with therapies for which he can find a ra tional basis However, it seems that the doctor may be protecting his scientific integri ty at some cost to the patients well- being (Polunin, 1982:20). 62 Clearly, ethnomedical knowledge presented valuable c lues to biomedical applications, and such assertion s could be viewed as an interest group tactic to negate and discredit the knowledge base of their rivals. For exa mple, of 121 drugs obtained from higher plants, 74% were discove red by scientists investigating the plants on the ba sis of ethnomedical claims (WHO, 1989b:4). Selection of pla nts for biochemical screening is far more efficient if guided by TRM practitioners (Barsh, 1997:28). 148 4.5.1:3 Interest group: TRM practitioners If the impression is given that biomedical interests were unique in being driven by acquisition of secondary resources, Elling reminds us that \u0093[w]it h no monopoly on crass economic motivations, these medicine men [TRM practitioners] s hare a good deal with some of their modern medical brothers \u0094 (1981b:91). To entrenched vested int erests, the benefits of an integration process would seem to flow personally to TRM pract itioners: \u0093more prestige, more security and probably more income\u0094 (Wolffers, 1990: 14). Integration offered increased access to limited secondary resources (status, inc ome) and official acknowledgment of their primary resource base. The reward for officia l government recognition is \u0093ultimately a share in the salaries, supplies and build ings provided by the government\u0094 (Last, 1986:11). The move to work formally within the biomedical health sector brough t the opportunity for TRM practitioners to enlarge their primary resource base through training and access to biomedical knowledge, techniques and drugs. Therefore, most comment ators noted readiness on their behalf to learn about and collaborate with the biomedic al sector. Green considers that \u0093prestige and recognition\u0094 (secondary resources) were primary motivating factors (Green, 1986:121; 1988:1128). This incentive develops from government and biomedica l association providing legitimacy and status. \u0093This prestige, along with any skills acquired in Western medicine [primary resources] enables a healer to att ract more clients and expand his or her practice [secondary resources]\u0094 (Green, 1988:1128). For example, in Swaziland TRM practitioners admired the tech nical skills and drugs (primary resources) of biomedical practitioners. They expressed interest in learning about x- ray technology, blood transfusions and injections of antibiotics (Gree n, 1988:1129; Green & Makhubu, 1984:1073). However, as MacCormack noted, these aspects of the prima ry resource base (techniques, drugs) were the least likely that biomedi cal practitioners would surrender to their rivals in the competition to secure patients (pr oviders of secondary resources) (MacCormack, 1986:153). While TRM practitioners coveted acc ess to biomedical primary resources, biomedical practitioners were more likely to g uard it than share it with them, and suffer the loss of secondary resources this would also entail. Despite this potential (yet limited) opportunity to expand ac cess to resources, many TRM practitioners also felt there were disadvantages in interacti ng officially with the formal health care sector, as it involved rationalising their primary resource ba se along biomedical 149principles. Their remedies, therapies, treatment modalitie s would have to be open to scrutiny and standardisation. They would have to accept \u0093a change in, and poss ibly even a disappearance of the tradition\u0094 (Wolffers, 1990:14). It also threatene d the secondary resources already enjoyed \u0096 the status of charismatic healer, the unt axed and unregulated incomes directly received from their patients, as well as the free dom from rules of conduct or of training and qualification. The move to integration thus encompassed a contradiction for TRM pr actitioners \u0096 it involved the opportunity to access greater secondary resources (s tatus, salaries and resources from the state; enhanced economic benefits and prestige flowing from ad opted biomedical skills). However, it also involved accepting a potential constric tion of their primary resource base and the granting of biomedical access to it. This serves t o simultaneously reduce access to secondary resources already obtained from an unrestricted ab ility to practice in the private sphere. \u0093Healers are ready to collaborate but not at any price: the y do not want to be absorbed by modern medicine which will regulate them to the rol e of mini-nurse, nor do they want to leave their products and techniques [primary resources] t o modern health practitioners\u0094 (Bibeau, 1982:1849). Therefore, TRM practitioners were placed in a bind where the ultimate outcomes and benefits from integration were unclear. While this process m ay offer potentially greater secondary resources (status, income), it may not be larger than that already enjoyed and it could in fact be jeopardised. Therefore, the amount of secondary resour ces already enjoyed by the practitioner seemed to be pivotal to their attitude to integratio n. Sacrificing their autonomy may not be worth it if the secondary resources could not be g uaranteed and their authority over their primary resource base had to be relinquished. As mentioned in the previous chapter, the attitude of TRM practitioners to integration therefore seems to be related to their degree of professionalisation, as this corre lates to the control they exert over their primary resource base (which allows them to then secure sec ondary resources). Some observers, aware of this bind: question why any respected local practitioners would want to join a national health service in its lowest ranks. They will be at the bottom of the bure aucratic heap, poorly paid or asked to do work for free, given least prestige [secondary resource s], the last to be supplied with drugs and in-service training [primary resources]. If th ey remain independent, they can continue to work on a fee-for-service basis, and retain l ocal respect by being readily available and able to use traditional herbal and other techniques w hen the supply of drugs to Government health workers dries up (MacCormack, 1986:154). A lack of professional cohesiveness and fragmentation within TRM hinder ed the development of professional associations; however professionalisa tion increased in this 150decade especially in Africa. In 1985, healers associations were operating at national or district levels in 23 African countries (see Green, 1986:141; Last & Chav unduka, 1986). The lack of professional associations and representation elsewhe re prevented adequate political recognition and created uncertainty to the process of official inco rporation, and practitioners were urged by the WHO to formalise their associations: Traditional health practitioners should group themselve s into associations through which they could interface with the modern health system, whether o r not they are formally part of it. An association of this nature could be a regulatory body wit h responsibility for ethical and professional matters. Without this formal structure, the confusion that exists now is likely to continue (WHO, 1991e:6). This quandary over resource control for TRM practitioners and lack of strong professional advocacy, combined with resistance from biomedical practit ioners and the practical logistical difficulties of implementation, led to negligible activity on n ational levels. The operation of these compounding factors is illustrated below in the example s of 6 countries (Thailand, Botswana, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Ghana, and Swaziland). These exam ples of country level implementation demonstrate the problems described above and how they m anifested in different contexts. 4.5.1:4 National examples of implementation In Thailand , a pilot project was implemented from 1974-1981, which involved training 300 TBAs to deliver health services. Although this project was re garded as successful, when it was expanded across other provinces as part of a PHC programme, no TR M practitioners were included. This was despite early planning documents indicating that this was to be an aspect of the programme (Pillsbury, 1982:1828). Later, there was successful c o-operation between practitioners only because there was a clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities, and these were defined by biomedical practitioners . For example, TRM practitioners could only treat people with simple and self-limi ting complaints (Wolffers, 1990:13). Formal recognition of TRM as a \u0093non-scientific system\u0094 was i n a subordinate position to biomedicine, and the attitudes of biomedical doctors to TRM practitioners was one of \u0093almost complete rejection\u0094 and mutual hostility (Cohen, 1989:165). Biomedical resistance to collaboration with TRM practition ers was considered a barrier to integration in Botswana (Barbee, 1986). Barbee concluded that the attitudes of biomedical practitioners were crucial to the success of integration programs, a nd in Botswana nurses occupied a brokering role. The nurses she canvassed opposed the id ea of formal co-operation 151with TRM practitioners as they were associated with sorcery an d were not considered legitimate providers of health care (1986:79-80). \u0093In their view co-ope ration means that traditional specialists should refer patients to biomedicine no t the reverse\u0094 (1986:79). In Botswana, attempts to integrate the two systems had not been pur sued as \u0093it is felt one or other of them might suffer in the process; instead, parallel developm ent is encouraged\u0094 (WHO, 1990c:31). Legislation regarding the regulation of TRM practitio ners had still not been passed, and these practitioners felt that referral of patient s had been unidirectional with biomedical practitioners rarely referring in return. Conflict was ev en evident between various groups within the ethnomedical system. For example, TRM pra ctitioners and spiritual healers were reported as not co-operating with each ot her and their basic relationship was described as \u0093competitive antagonism\u0094 (Barbee, 1986:78). Slikkerveer (1982) assessed the operation of pluralistic medical syste ms in Ethiopia , and concluded that although a unified system and progressive integration was desirable, it was impeded by various constraints and obstacles. These included differ ences in beliefs, values and practices; commercial motivations; reluctance to share and exchange details of medicinal plants and customs; prejudices against TRM diagnosis and treatments ; and fear by TRM practitioners of prosecution, taxation and humiliation from offi cial contact (1982:1867). This reality contrasted with a tolerant legal position, and TRM was adm inistratively ignored \u0093partly due to scepticism and a lack of confidence in [TRM] and part ly to the prestige connected with an \u0091intelligent\u0092 and \u0091modern\u0092 use of Western sophis ticated medicines\u0094 (1982:1868). Historically entrenched ethnic, religious and politica l rivalries also militated against collaborative efforts and there were hardly any a ttempts to officially utilise TRM in the formal health care system. The lag in policy implementation and program development in Ethiopia was recognised, despite Government statements of support. It created suspicion am ongst TRM practitioners about the sincerity and intentions of the Ministry of Health. The organis ation and registration of healers had met with problems, and professional associations la cked funds, guidance and personnel to effectively promote the interests of practitioners (WHO, 1990c:36). Health education efforts were also directed to TRM practitioners in a \u0093derogatory manner\u0094 (WHO, 1990c:38). An important point of contention in Ethiopia was that \u0093exclusi ve emphasis\u0094 was placed on research into herbal medicine (phytotherapy). Limited resources w ere directed to seeking detailed information on TRM medicines. TRM practitioners resented this, as there were no 152assurances of involving them in testing their drugs or the sharing of a ny economic benefits if this led to commercialisation (secondary resources) (WHO, 1990c:37). There was resistance on both sides to mutually exchanging information: TRM practitioners were reluctant to disclose details of their primary resource base without clear leg al rights to the outcomes, and biomedical practitioners were dismissive of potential validity (WH O, 1990c:37-38). This tension reflects asserting control over primary resources and acc ess to any secondary resources that may flow from that control. In Nigeria , the majority of the population used TRM, and surveys conducted revea led support between TRM and biomedical practitioners for integration (C hiwuzie et al., 1987). However, it was also acknowledged that the greatest opposition to TRM came from biomedical professionals (1987:240) and that little practical research had been undertaken into how to implement integration (1987:241). The concept of integratio n as endorsed by the biomedical profession was also conditional and restricted: in se parate institutions, only in some fields, only at the PHC level, after standardisation, if ad equately monitored, and for purposes of research on medicinal plants. Very few recognised any posi tive aspects of TRM, and most considered that the reason TRM was popular was due to a lack of access to biomedicine (1987:242). The idea for integration was supported by more TR M than biomedical practitioners.63 While Chiwuzie et al., (1987) found conditional support amongst practitioners for integration in Nigeria, Pearce (1986) found that biomedical practitioners were rel uctant for TRM practitioners to be included as personnel in the formal health care s ystem. The majority of biomedical practitioners were not interested in co-operating wit h their TRM counterparts either as colleagues or junior workers (Pearce, 1986:239). In addition, biomedical practitioner acknowledgement of TRM knowledge depended upon whether it could be submitted to scientific analysis, which was a \u0093convenient rally ing-point for preserving the present status/legal differences\u0094 (Pearce, 1986:240). The attitude of TRM practitioners to integration was mixed \u0096 while they wanted official recognition, they were also apprehensive and feared being \u0093wiped out as practitioners\u0094, their knowledge being absorbed, and becoming subject to interference or control by biomedical practit ioners (Pearce, 1986:240- 241). 63 While 20% of biomedical doctors favoured integrati on, 50% favoured it conditionally and 30% did not fav our it (Chiwuzie et al., 1987:241). In contrast, out of 17 5 TRM practitioners, 81 favoured integration in the same institutions; 80 favoured integration in separate or special institutions or in some fields; and 14 did not favour integration (Chiwuzie et al., 1987:243). 153A programme implemented in Ghana (Warren, 1986; Warren et al., 1982) was both \u0093inspiring and depressing\u0094 (Maclean, 1986:29). It showed that while some prog ress could be made, it required vast amounts of time, effort and financial s upport that would be beyond the scope of the majority of communities in Africa. Maclean also c riticises it as it was based on a one-way transfer of knowledge from biomedicine to TRM. The initia tor of the programme notes that it was based on the \u0093simplest form of collaboration wh ere traditional healers are shown selected Western methods of dealing with common problems\u0094 ( Warren et al., 1982:1879).64 In Ghana, besides the programme mentioned and TBAs, little attenti on had been paid to TRM practitioners by health policy makers. Despite sharing a common goal to protect health \u0093the predominant attitude between [TRM and biomedical practitioners ] has been mutual disregard\u0094 (Warren et al., 1982:1873). The role of TRM in health poli cy was described as \u0093purposefully ambiguous\u0094 although cautious acceptance was indica ted by programmes using TBAs, the establishment of a research centre of plant medicines and recognition of a TRM professional association (Warren et al., 1982:1875). Green and Makhubu (1984) pointed out, in their study of Swaziland , that most TRM practitioners\u0092 received sufficient incomes from their private prac tices, and would not be attracted to the meagre salaries provided by government employment. However, if they were officially used to extend health services, they would exp ect financial reimbursement (1984:1074-1075). There was a noticeable degree of suspicion and competiti on between different types of TRM practitioners, as also noted in Botswana . For example, diviners criticised herbalists as unguided by spirits, while herbalist s condemned diviners for going beyond their diagnostic function and using plant therapies they did not unde rstand (1984:1072). As also experienced in Ethiopia, obstacles existed to integration in the form of incompatible theory and practices; a bias against TRM and suspicions about the motivations of the government by TRM practitioners (Green & Makhubu, 1984:1077). Programmes implemented in Swaziland which were based on TRM pract itioners participation created animosity from biomedical practitioners, a nd were met with vague responses from the TRM practitioners themselves (Gort, 1989:1100). The grow ing interest in their activities caused confusion as TRM practitioners were \u0093u naccustomed to having 64 The training course covered environmental health, pr eventative and promotive health measures, the Billin gs method of contraception and simple biomedicine. As m entioned, instruction in the use of basic biomedici nes was abandoned due to limited supply and uncertainty ove r future provision (Warren et al., 1982:1877). This official reason for limiting training may have reflected biomed ical concern over access to their primary resources, and indicated that their primary resource base (drugs) w as considered insufficient to share. 154normally culturally biased Westerners extol their virtues\u0094 (1989:1100). W hile some TRM practitioners were willing to co-operate with biomedicine, others w ere indifferent or even hostile. Those practitioners who were the most successful (grea test secondary resources) were the most resistant to collaboration: They suspect that \u0091standardizing practices\u0092, adhering to a regulated fee schedule, and becoming part of a poorly paid and highly regulated government bureaucracy would be neither beneficial or lucrative they fear that cooperati on could actually undermine their relationships with patients by having the healer appear to be answerable to secular rather than sacred forces (Gort, 1989:1100, emphasis added). The realities of implementation experienced on national l evels were congruent with what had been predicted in the technical report on TRM (WHO, 1978b). The deli berating committee had recognised then that even in situations where the policy on integ ration was \u0093favourable\u0094, other potential limitations may impede practical implementati on. Included in the list was \u0093payment of lip-service\u0094 (symbolic policies); apprehension abou t possible harmful effects of TRM; opposition by intractable advocates of different medical syst ems, and legal apparatus that protects the entrenched biomedical system, encourag es monopoly, and even excludes or forbids the practice of other systems (WHO, 1978b:18-19). These obsta cles were discernible throughout the 1980s, and hindered the practical re-organisation of f ormal health services to accommodate TRM. 4.6 Conclusion Throughout the 1980s, the idealistic health policy concepts that had gained international support in the 1970s (such as HFA, PHC and the integration of TRM in form al health care systems to provide increased access to affordable health care ) were confronted with harsh economic and political realities that retarded their execution and operation at national levels. The enthusiasm displayed in policy formulation in the 1970s for these noti ons did not transform into substantial, sustained or systematic activity i n the following decade either within the WHO as an organisation or within countries that had endor sed the initiatives. There was a wide gap between the policy pronouncements and actual progra mme development. The politics stream in the 1980s was not favourable to the implementation of schemes that required large investments of public funds, major restructuring of infrastructure, strong political commitment to social welfare goals and the expans ion of services. The political environment was dominated by neo-liberal economic schools of thought, whic h shaped the 155way in which problems were recognised and framed, and the policy solutions that were deemed effective to meet them. The global recession in the 1980s provid ed the conditions for neo-liberal and economic rationalist thought to become firmly e ntrenched on the policy agenda. Many countries faced high inflation, spiralling debt, an d wide unemployment and therefore efficiency in resource allocation and reducing c osts became paramount. In this decade, issues such as community based health interventions and the development of longer term programmes to provide increased health care coverage we re overshadowed on the agenda by higher profile issues that were competing for recognition a nd resolution. Economic and not health or social welfare issues were at the fore front of domestic and international agendas. Political volatility, instability and conflict also absorbed much of the focus \u0096 for example, nations in Eastern Europe, China, Latin Amer ica and Africa were reorienting political and economic systems and coping with domesti c crisis. The WHO was also buffeted by political conflicts surrounding its support of high pro file, contentious health policies (essential drugs, primary health care, infant formula debate) and financial pressures. In this milieu, TRM struggled to maintain visibility on the agen da but fortuitously gained some leverage from newly emerging problems such as environmental conservation and HIV/AIDS. Reich (1987) described some of the difficulties surrounding the esse ntial drugs concept, and these features are also common to the PHC and TRM programmes. These concepts were all inspired, adopted globally and modelled after the successful impl ementation of similar initiatives in particular locations \u0096 for example, Essential Drugs (Cuba, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Costa Rica), PHC (Kenya, Indonesia, Philippines, Tanzania) a nd integration of TRM (China). After achieving international support, these policie s then required national level transfer and replication in very different and sometimes unfavourab le contexts. Difficulties were encountered in the transfer phase due to both the amb iguity of the concepts (which was required to reach consensus at the global level) and also beca use they raised complex and contentious economic, political and ethical issues. While ambigu ity may be functional at the international level, it is not helpful in making difficult decisions at national levels (Reich, 1987:49). Opponents to change or to specific policies know that the window for opportunity c loses quickly, and therefore can prevent policy adoption or implementatio n by stalling and delaying required or agreed changes (Kingdon, 1984:170). The window of oppor tunity for integration quickly closed in the 1980s when global recession and ne o-liberal policies took hold. Economic and political circumstances in the politics stream conspired against the 156concept of integration, and it appeared to flounder in a mire of concep tual and practical difficulties of interpretation and implementation. There wa s also a lack of consistent and clear guidance from the WHO to resolve such complications. In this global environment, TRM suffered from a lack of political advocacy and economic support on both in ternational and national levels. TRM was hindered in the political sphere due to its heterogenous nature an d the fact that it did not have the strength of organised and well funded professional bodies to more forcefully push claims. The integration process could therefore more easily b e dominated and manipulated by the biomedical profession. This enabled biomedicine to as sume the role of gatekeepers, dominate the policy process and limit the parameter s of integration (for example, by demanding scientific evidence of safety and effic acy of the TRM primary resource base). In addition, the professional motivations of TRM and biomedical pract itioners created a deadlock in policy and programme development, as co-operation wa s largely absent due to the lack of secondary resources (economic benefits, status, prestige) that was required for the necessary collaboration. Biomedical practitioners did not want to l ose their existing secondary resources to competitors, and thus promoted and protect ed their primary resources and discredited TRM. Similarly, TRM practitioners were ambivalent about integration and collaboration as any secondary resources to be gained from this process were unclear. Integration potentially reduced the existing primary and secondar y resources they already enjoyed and there were few incentives offered for co-operation whi ch was vital for integration to proceed. The predicaments over formal legal recognition of TRM were shared by CAM in the North. TRM/CAM increasingly sought political recognition but faced a dilem ma over the process required to achieve it. A realisation of the need to formalise their roles through associations (professionalise) was tempered by an acknowledgement that this co uld threaten their primary resource base. \u0093If defining the scope and conditions of practice fo r new alternative practitioners is left to [bio]medical doctors, holistic healt h care will tend to conform to the constructs of scientific medicine\u0094 and they would need to accep t biomedical dominance (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:540). Thus the situation remained: There is a growing sense of urgency to secure some formal recognition by Act of Parliament. But just how, and for whom, is difficult to sort out. For man y reasons, it might be best to leave things as they are But there is a threat from [bio medicine] the worry is that the 157alternatives that appeal to the doctors will be medicalise d the monopoly will thus reassert itself (West, 1984:344). In the 1990s, the problem stream changed rapidly and thus propelled TRM (along with CAM) onto the political agenda. While the 1980s appeared to present only los t opportunities to implement a radical new direction in health systems struct ure and policy, new economic and political conditions in the 1990s revived the concept of integration. Continuing lagging or ad hoc national level policy development became an untenable po sition, and the policy agenda again became receptive to the concept of integration. Howe ver, the questions of how best to do this and how to practically implement integration still r emained politically contentious and difficult to resolve. The following chapter cons iders the policy context in the 1990s, and the impact of political, economic and social developments in te rms of the content and fate of CAM/TRM in health policy. 1585. 1990s: Re-emergence of TRM on the health agenda the current globalization of the herbal industry is a phenomenon of international capitalism and a contributing cause of multiple inequalities the taken for granted dominance of \u0091science\u0092 and \u0091technology\u0092 used as social and cultural policy, continue to attack different cultural frameworks as primitive/pre-science/irrat ional. (Jagtenberg & Evans, 2003:323) In the 1990s, the policy terrain for TRM changed dramatically as T RM/CAM became an established massive multi-billion dollar industry. This was a fundamental factor behind the sudden re-emergence of TRM as an international health policy pr iority in 2002, when the WHO released a global Traditional Medicine Strategy (WHO, 2002e) (outlined further in the next chapter). While the policy of integration had failed to take root and was deteriorating in an arid political and economic environment throughout the 1980s, in the 1990s condit ions developed that fostered regeneration. The revolution in healthcare delivery advocated in the 1970s had failed to eventuate, but in the 1990s a consumer led revolution pushed TRM back onto the policy agenda. The unanticipated and rapid development of a global market fo r TRM was both an opportunity and a threat to TRM systems of health care. While such patronage raised their profile and profitability (secondary resources) it also left th em vulnerable to exploitation as their primary resource base was threatened by the intense clin ical and commercial interest from the North. This situation was compounded by environmental degrad ation. In 1993, UNESCO/WWF reported that in Africa the supply of medicinal plants w as failing to meet demand (Bodeker & Bichan, 1996:390), and by the end of the decade 9 000 species of medicinal plants were threatened with extinction (Burford et al., 2000:11). Akerele further estimated that 60 000 species or nearly a quarter of the world\u0092s tota l would be extinct by the middle of the 21st century if present trends continued (1993:390). The lag in development and implementation of national policy and regulation now presented a serious impediment to protecting TRM primary resources used by c ommunities in the South for basic health care, and in preserving the economic benefits (sec ondary resources) that flowed from the use of such resources. The wealth of potential for commercial development of pharmaceuticals, nutritional supplements, cosme tics and other products based on TRM/CAM primary resources meant that the previously negl ected field was being \u0093mined\u0094 by biomedical interests. 159 According to some, in a trend that mimicked the commodities me ntality of the colonial era (when the South was viewed as an exploitable source of minerals, gem s, timber, fibres or food) \u0096 indigenous knowledge, TRM and ecosystems were now sources of a new f orm of gold, \u0093mines of green gold\u0094 (EU, 2002) transformed into drugs, supplement s and health products. Prospecting for this new bounty became a lucrative busine ss that was fuelled by the biotechnology industry, viewed as a form of neo-colonialism (Bodeker, 1994b:14; Idris, 2003; Shiva, 1997, 2001). New economic incentives were threatening the survi val of plant species (especially through over-harvesting) and therefore ultima tely the health of populations in the South (Eskinazi & Mindes, 2001:22). In the 1990s, trade, environment, biodiversity, agriculture, sustainable de velopment, indigenous resources, traditional knowledge systems, and globalisatio n all became topical and controversial issues. TRM is a field that intersects all these areas, and therefore became increasingly complex and contentious. New words entered the vocab ulary of this policy domain, such as \u0093bio-prospecting\u0094 and \u0093biopiracy\u0094. Biopirac y was a term coined as a defence in the South, which had been accused by the North of \u0093intellec tual piracy\u0094. Biopiracy refers to the unauthorised extraction (theft) and/or patenting of biological resources or traditional knowledge (primary resources) (Dutfiel d, 2000:8; Wayland, 2003). While the North accused the South of intellectual piracy, the South pro tested the systematic looting of their biological heritage. In this way, TRM became bound up with trade and development issues, co nvoluted patent disputes, and legal interpretations on ownership and rights. TRM re presented an interface of North-South conflict. It moved beyond the health arena to unfamiliar territory \u0096 the World Trade Organisation (WTO), World Bank, World Intellectual Prope rty Organisation (WIPO) and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The growth in popularity of TRM/CAM had generated a bonanza of secondary resource s that stakeholders were now keen to lay claim to. Other international bodies also took an active role in TRM in their roles as conservation advocates or watchdogs (such as the World Wide Fund for Nature and The World Conservation Union). The policy domain became a confu sing tangle of acronyms, protocols, conventions and guidelines as it was split across many agencies, each with different priorities and mandates. The urgency of resolving economic, environmental, legal and public heal th matters meant that TRM as a policy issue could no longer be ignored or avoided. I n 2002, a window opened in the problem , politics and policy streams again and the policy of integration of TRM was 160re-born in the form of the WHO Strategy on TRM (WHO, 2002e), the first global policy in this field. The broader policy context (below) establishes the circ umstances surrounding the emergence of the Strategy, as according to Kingdon (1984) the policy environm ent is crucial to understanding why and when particular issues arise on the agenda. Th e broader context forms the backdrop to activity in the TRM policy field, and can on ly be understood in relation to it. Section 1: Policy context 5.1 The broader policy context The 1990s did not usher in a period of prosperity and peace that the end o f the Cold War and apartheid seemed to promise. With the dissolution of superpower blocs , an emphasis on the arms race and weapons stockpiling was no longer required and it w as anticipated that such expenditure could be channelled to development efforts. This beca me urgent as economic growth and development had still not managed to address basic needs in the South. However, ethnic and political instability in Europe, Africa A sia and the Middle East led to an ongoing succession of international and civil conflicts and humanita rian crises. The transition from central planning to free market economies ha d been particularly challenging in many countries. In Africa, drought and falls in com modity prices hindered economic growth. Asia experienced a currency collapse and debt c risis, despite economic liberalisation. Although economic and trade issues related to T RM was a new development, there was a resemblance in the broader policy environment to many of the prominent issues of the 1970s, such as a concern with population growth, development, an d longer term resource management. Later in the decade, social justice issues ( for example, alleviation of poverty, child and maternal health, improving access to education) an d basic needs also became increasingly significant in international bodies such as the United Nations. As in the 1970s, social justice and natural resource management issues came t o the fore, but tempered this time around with a pragmatic economic rationalism. 5.1.1 Sustainability and Development In 1998, the WWF estimated that one third of the world\u0092s natural wea lth was lost between 1970 and 1995 as a result of human activity (Klare, 2001:18), and the finiteness o f natural resources loomed large throughout the decade. Prompted by the Brundtland C ommission 161(1987), which had articulated the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations held a conference on Environment and Development (1992) known as the Ear th Su mmit - the first of seven UN conferences exploring the themes of environme ntally sound development. Development efforts were increasingly moderated w ith an awareness of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to also meet their needs. Other significant forums along this theme we re the International Conference on Population and Development (1994), World Su mmit for Social Development (1995) and Human Settlements \u0096 Habitat II (1996). At the 1995 Su mmit, the 20/20 initiative was endorsed which called for 20% of public expenditure in low income c ountries and 20% of official assistance to be spent on basic social needs (Lee et al., 1996). Sustainable development was linked with international developme nt more broadly, in terms of encouraging self-reliance and self-sufficiency while c onserving and protecting natural resources. The Earth Summit had in fact been overshadowed by dem ands from the South for better terms of trade, debt relief, and increased aid \u0096 harking back t o the New International Economic Order (NIEO) manifesto of the 1970s (Sachs, 1993:6). In 2000, the larges t ever gathering of heads of state agreed to a series of goals called t he UN Millennium Declaration (UN, 2000). Many of these targets were first set out by international conferences and summits held throughout the 1990s. They included eradicating poverty and hunger; achieving universal primary education; promoting gender equality; reducing child mortality; improving maternal health; combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseas es; ensuring environmental sustainability; and developing a global partnership for development. Abbasi (2004) points out, that aside from HIV/AIDS, these goals were esse ntially unchanged from objectives held since 1900. The goals to be achieved by 2015 were a pact between the North and the South . In that sense, this Declaration differed from previous agreements where targets had been set for developing countries to aspire to (Abbasi, 2004; Haines & Cassels, 2004). I n contrast, the UN Millennium Declaration acknowledged that the North also had a ro le in terms of fair trade, development assistance, debt relief, access to essenti al medicines, and technology transfer. This concept was reaffirmed in 2002 at the internatio nal conference in Mexico on financing development (Haines & Cassels, 2004). 1625.1.2 Trade and Intellectual Property Rights The entrenched poverty, under-development and lack of access to ba sic services in the South were argued by some to be related to unfair trade arrangements th at favoured the North, and further polarised wealth and power Amin, 1997; Dasgupta, 1998; Gelinas, 2003). As the NIEO initiative of the 1970s had failed to eventuate, the South was left in a weakened economic and political position in many of the ne gotiations. International frameworks favoured the North and allowed their capital isation of indigenous resources from the South (Elliot, 1998; Gedicks, 1994; Hawthorne, 2002). In ad dition, many countries in the South endured great hardships in implementi ng the requirements of the international agreements, while struggling with external debt and facing dwindling development aid (Abbasi 1999:867). This directly affected the quality of health and social service sectors (Mogedal & Steen, 1995:351). The UN Millennium Goals wer e an effort in part to address these concerns and a concession to North-South power imbalance in trade and economic negotiations. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) came under increasingly hostile attack during the decade, particularly from the anti-globalisation movement whic h represented diverse groups bound by commitment to human rights, social-democratic principle s and a rejection of rapid economic liberalisation and international capitalist expans ion. For example, the celebration to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the General Agreement on Tr ade and Tariffs (GATT, the predecessor of the WTO) in Geneva, 1998 turned into a riot with thousands of demonstrators protesting the free-trade system which the WTO represented and promoted. The irony of \u0093free-trade\u0094 was that while it espoused econom ic liberalisation, it simultaneously allowed the North to establish protective barrier s like tariffs and subsidies, imposing more costs than benefits on the South (Amin, 1997; Dunkley, 1997; Ellwood, 2001; Khor, 2000, 2001; Lang & Hines, 1993). Further massive protests continued to dog the WTO and other inter national bodies such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD). The neo-liberal philosophy prom oted by these supranational bodies was called into question by development, soci al and environmental groups. These agencies were seen to undermine national sovereignty and self-determination, through imposing economic and social policy conditions for the receip t of loans (structural adjustments) and locking the South into debt-servicing. The inte rests of multi-national corporations and more powerful nations seemed to dominate the interests or needs of 163communities (Bello, 1994). Echoing another theme from the 1970s \u0096 whether econom ic growth itself was intrinsically beneficial (Schumacher, 1973), the merits and meaning of development again became increasingly questioned (Dharmasiri, 1997; Ha milton, 2003; Sachs, 1992). A significant emerging issue during the decade was the Trade Relat ed aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS) under the auspices of Gen eral Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) in 1994. TRIPS aimed to globalise the standards of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. All members of WTO were expected to abi de with the standards by 2005. TRIPS covered various types of IPR, among them patents, geogr aphical indications, undisclosed information (\u0093trade secrets\u0094) and trademarks. TRI PS had controversial impacts on the provision and pricing of biomedical pharmaceuticals, but also had c omplex influences on TRM and a complicated interplay with trade, conservation , biodiversity and indigenous knowledge concept of \u0093sustainable development\u0094 was linked to environm ental issues more generally. At the Earth Summit in 1992, a Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was agreed. Due to the relationship of Intellectual Property Right s (IPR) with conservation, sustainability and benefit sharing, they were included as part of t he negotiations. The Convention gave nations sovereign rights over their biological re sources, which had previously been considered the \u0093common heritage of mankind\u0094. This agreement theoretically enabled countries in the South greater control and a more equit able share of benefits obtained from the economic exploitation of their natural resources a nd traditional knowledge. Considering that wealth and technology were concentrated in t he North, and biodiversity and poverty in the South, questions of equity in using genetic resources for sustainable development were particularly hard to address to the sa tisfaction of all stakeholders (Shiva, 1993; WRI, 1993). Climate change firmly entered the international agenda in 1988, an d atmospheric pollution (acid rain, ozone depletion, and global warming) were all considered crucial to future environmental health, including biodiversity. Various conferences a nd negotiations were held throughout the 1990s, leading to the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change in 1997. Some countries in the North did not support either the CBD or the Kyoto Protoc ol. The US withdrew support for the Protocol in 2001, arguing that the scientific justification for it was 164not sound and it would interfere with economic growth. The balanc e between environmental conservation and trade, development and economic progress was prov ing difficult to mediate (Khan, 2002; Meyer-Abich, 1993). Natural resources and their management became an arena of politica l discord (Gedicks, 1994; Sachs, 1993). Klare (2001) argued that resource scarcity and secur ity (oil, water, minerals, timber) was an emerging area of global conflict, aggra vated by the sharply diminishing vital natural resource base. Plants (agricultural and medicinal) could be added to this list of contested resources. An indigenous dimension was laced th roughout this conflict, in relation to a wide range of natural resources (e.g. land, wat er, forests) that held spiritual, cultural and traditional meanings to indigenous communities and not simply as ends to economic growth (Gedicks, 1994; Shiva, 1991, 1997). 5.1.4 Indigenous Knowledge and Biopiracy During the 1990s, indigenous knowledge systems and traditional biological res ources were recognised as valuable assets. Indigenous knowledge was an essential aspect of environmental conservation and biodiversity , indispensable to survival ( health ) for communities in the South and mankind, a component of sustainable development , and potentially generated significant economic benefits as a source of revenue (Biber-Klemm, 2000; Dutfield, 2000, 2002; Mhame, 2000). TRM was no longer just a matter of cost- effective health care or an adjunct to delivering basic biomedica l services; it was intricately bound up with other policy concerns on the international agenda. The new found respect for indigenous peoples and knowledge was refl ected in the United Nations announcing 1993 as the \u0093Year of the World\u0092s Indigenous People\u0094 and an International Decade of the World's Indigenous People (1995-2004) in December of that year. The main objective of these initiatives was to resolve pro blems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights, the environment, development, education and health. In 2000, the Commission on Human Rights established a Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. This new appreciation of indigenous knowledge systems followed the Brund tland Commission ( 1987) which had suggested traditional or indigenous types of land use may be more compatible with sustainable development than modern pract ices (Kennedy & Olsson, 1996:42). The World Bank and other development bodies also developed an em phasis on the utilisation and promotion of indigenous knowledge (IK), or traditional know ledge (TK) for furthering development. 165The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) aimed to protect indigenous k nowledge and assert ownership rights by communities, however TRIPS was far more pow erful and had a greater influence on trade. TRIPS made no reference to the protection of traditional knowledge (Bodeker, 2000; Bodeker & Kronenberg, 2002). This aspect was contenti ous and review was sought by many countries in the South (Raghavan, 2000). Th ese countries were especially concerned that the TRIPS agreement did not encourage those seeking biotechnology patents to respect the principles of the CBD, including ob taining permission from the community or country of origin and sharing benefits. A n obligation to disclose the geographical origin of any biological material used in biotech invention s was proposed in 2002 in order to harmonise the application of TRIPS and CBD. The crux of this contentious issue was the transformation of trad itional knowledge into commodities and the subsequent benefit sharing. TRM featured promine ntly in these debates and generated some of the more highly publicised biopiracy disputes. Wh en the value of indigenous knowledge was recognised and exploited, commercial interest s and indigenous philosophies collided. This issue is too complex to discuss here beyond briefly mentioning it as one important aspect of the policy context (Bodeker, 2000; 2003). A central problem was that indigenous taxonomies for classifying natural resources diverged from Wester n classificatory frameworks and assumptions, but patent and regulatory frameworks we re built on Western scientific and ownership concepts (Shiva, 2001). For example, patent and copyright laws face difficulties accommodating TRM primary resources (Air hihenbuwa, 1995:57; Kumar, 2000b; WHO, 2000c:5-7). These discrepancies and a lack of national leg al frameworks for IPR, funds and expertise in the South allowed the North to patent foo d, plants, genes and biological resources. Third World resources and knowledge are thus being conver ted into the \u0093intellectual property\u0094 of northern corporations, which will collect roya lties from Third World countries similar to the time when colonizers took resources from the m in the first instance (Shiva, 2001:29). 5.2 Trends in the health field The main trends present internationally in the health field du ring the 1990s again reflect the themes of the broader policy context. These themes include a n escalating contraction of resources for social services that encouraged an emphasis on the effectiveness and efficiency of existing health services and treatments (flowing through into the development of evidence based medicine), and their sustainable longer term development. A surgi ng interest in 166natural, holistic forms of health care and the social and physica l environmental aspects of human health also became more prominent, reflecting an environme ntal consciousness (see Macdonald, 2005; Wilkinson & Marmot, 1999; 2003). Economic and environmental t hemes are therefore woven through many of the health policy trends an d agenda priorities of the decade, and filtered through to institutional activities. 5.2.1 Financing (Effectiveness & Efficiency) The issues related to financing reform of health care systems are ve ry complex and contentious, and cannot be discussed adequately in the space avail able. Broad trends are instead noted, as they influenced the context of the policy dom ain and shaped debate in the field. Neo-liberal economic policies of market deregulation, t rade liberalisation and privatisation all had an impact on the provision of health services, which became even more strictly governed by an emphasis on efficiency and effectiv eness. Privatisation of health services, user fees and encouraging private health insuranc e were all outcomes of the new economic perspective. The influential neo-liberal economic parad igm redefined health as a commodity or investment, rather than a human right (Buse & Walt, 2000:177; Laurell & Lopez-Arellano, 1996:1).65 The World Bank World Development Report Investing in Health (1993) is considered the cornerstone of this paradigm, and is considered to have strongly influenced health policy development (Buse, 1994; Werner & Sanders, 1997; Zwi & M ills, 1995:313-314). Health was considered a private responsibility and health care a privat e (not public) good that could be adequately and equitably provided by market mechanisms (Laur ell & Lopez-Arellano, 1996). Investing in Health introduced the metric of \u0093disability adjusted life years\u0094 (DALY\u0092s). This indicator was used as a method to guide resource all ocation, as health interventions and services that would reduce the DALY were conside red the most efficient use of health care resources (Abbasi, 1999f:1005-1006). However, the methodology used t o develop the DALY calculation and assumptions underlying it were heavily criticised \u0096 for example, it linked health with economic productivity (Werner, 2001; W erner & Sanders, 1997) and was considered inequitable (Abbasi, 1999f:1006). 65 Health is often recognised as a fundamental, or hu man right, in international declarations including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Hancock, 1999:6). \u0093 H ealth cannot be an enforceable \u0091right\u0092 but health s ervices, as a means of achieving health, and the manner in which they are distributed, may be\u0094 (Hancock, 1999:6 quoti ng Lenaghan 1996:ii). 167The primacy of economics became embedded within health systems development and seemed to over-ride ethical, equity and social justice prioriti es (Hanson & Callahan, 1999). The newly emerging \u0093evidence based medicine\u0094 paradigm (Guyatt, Ca irns, & Churchill, 1992) became quickly entrenched in health services policy and pr actice and tied neatly with the neo-liberal approach to provision of services. Pioneered by Cochrane (1972), \u0093evidence based medicine\u0094 applied standards of evidence based on scientifi c method and offered an \u0093objective\u0094 method to determine effective and efficient allocat ion (or rationing) of health care (Hancock, 1999:94). It thus corresponded with the contemporary e conomic climate. Biomedicine, and all other treatment modalities including TRM /CAM, had to clearly demonstrate efficacy and evidence of cost-effectiveness to b e part of efficient health care provision. 5.2.2 Health systems development The future financing of health systems and their organisation to mee t needs in the 21st century became a compelling issue by the turn of the century (Frenk et al., 1997; Mogedal & Steen, 1995). It appeared that the goals and development objectives set could only be reached with strengthening health systems, but the climate of ec onomic stringency overshadowed the nature of reforms canvassed. Escalating health cost s combined with shrinking resources resulted in an emphasis on ways to control and restrict costs. Health systems development was heavily influenced by such concepts, unde r the stewardship of the World Bank which had begun to overshadow the WHO. Concerns with economics, efficiency, organisation, and technic al aspects resulted in equity, needs, and ethics problems being frequently neglected (Bodeker, 2001c; Ha nson & Callahan, 1999:53). However, the peculiarities of the health care market meant that economics alone could not address all resource allocation questions (Easthope, 1993; Walt & Gilson, 1994:290-291) and reducing inequities remained problematic (Gwatkin, 2002). A lmost all policy tools used aimed at cost containment, but the effectiveness o f these tools on allocative efficiency was not well understood (Xingzhu, 2003:6). Although there was evidence that the allocation of more resources to primary and preventive care (suc h as that offered by TRM/CAM) is highly cost effective and even cost saving, and would i mprove efficiency of health services, there appeared to be no clear mechanism for achie ving the desirable resource shifts (Xingzhu, 2003:5). At the same time, the regressive impacts of globalisation were be coming more apparent. For example, in China health care indices deteriorated after the ad option of a free market 168philosophy. Statistics demonstrated that the remarkable healt h improvements achieved during the Communist government (partly attained due to the pragmati c use of all medical/health resources, as well as equitable access to other se rvices) were rapidly reversing. This was correlated with an increasing polarisa tion of wealth and other social policy failures (see Liu et al., 2001). In China, increasing expendi ture per capita for health care through neo-liberal concepts of free market, user fees and health insurance did not produce corresponding improvements in health status (Hsiao, 1995:1047) and Chi nese biomedical practitioners increased drug prescription, used expens ive drugs and adopted high- technology tests in order to increase profits (secondary resources) ( Hsiao, 1995:1054). 5.2.3 Complementary and Alternative Medicine Much has been written on the rise of CAM in the North in the 1990s, and the rea sons for it, of which only a brief reference can be made here (see Astin, 1998; As tin et al., 1998; Barrett, 2003; al., 2003; Cant & Jonas & Levin, 1999; Saks, 1998; 1992). The increasing resort to these healing moda lities can be seen as an interesting parallel to the paradox of continued and even strengt hening use of TRM in the South. Treating the \u0093maladies of modernisation\u0094 (such as chronic di et and lifestyle related conditions including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, anxiety, stress and depression) required an emphasis on psycho-social and preventive dimensions of healing. Biomedicine was not meeting the full needs of populations (as had be en recognised in the South in the 1970s), and the rising global use of TRM/CAM created a progres sively pluralistic health care sphere. For example, demographic and health transitions such as an ageing population and a growth in some chronic conditions, encouraged re course to TRM/CAM in the North. Health conditions associated with obesity and depression rapidly became problematic issues not readily resolved by biomedicine, a nd threatened to become major costs to the state by 2020 (Janes, 1999:1807). People using CAM were not poor, neurotic or uneducated and it was both a pragmatic and rational use of resources (Jonas & Levin, 1999:4). There have been various commentaries conjecturing on the rising use o f CAM, as mentioned in the previous chapter. While the reasons for this growth and the sc ope of these healing modalities are interesting, for the purposes of this research on ly several factors are salient. Firstly, the rapid growth in CAM served to fragment and erode biome dical power and monopoly in the health services sphere, and biomedical authority wa s being undermined from below (community) not above (state). Secondly, this extraor dinary growth in demand 169for CAM created a massive global market for plant/herbal remedies , and TRM treatment modalities. New consumers in the North gave economic and political weight to medic al pluralism as they adopted TRM/CAM primary resources and therefore generated unpre cedented secondary resources (status, prestige, economic benefits) for the s ector. The number of practitioners of CAM increased rapidly \u0096 in the 1990s in Great Britain the number of CAM practitioners doubled to 60 000 and exceeded the number of biomedical ge neral practitioners (Saks, 2003a:144). This represented a seismic shift in healthcare t hat threatened to reduce biomedical monopoly, professional dominance and status (secondary r esources) (Cant & Sharma, 2000; Easthope, 1993; Saks, 1994; Sharma, 1992) but also offered an opportunity to potentially expand their primary resource base through co-option. Conve rsely, it represented an augmentation and increase of previously disparate TRM/CAM second ary resources (material rewards, status, and prestige) and an opportunity to in crease structural strength on national levels. Therefore, a tension and complex power balance resulted, with stak eholders needing to assess their situation and either re-align or mobilise strat egies in defence to protect existing interests. Conflict can be seen to centre on primary resources \u0096 spec ifically the control, regulation, and authority to distribute the \u0093new\u0094 resources in the N orth (CAM), and also access to the secondary resources that had now accrued globally. This again was played out and resolved with recourse to scientific discourse and professiona lisation (discussed further in section 5.5). The WHO (to which we now turn) initially negl ected or ignored and then tried to neutralise many of these conflicts. However, it was not ope rating as an impartial agent but as a stakeholder with its own imperatives and rationales. Section 2: International bodies 5.3 WHO activities During the 1990s, the WHO faced a range of crises across the full gamut of management, leadership, administration, structure, finances, objectives and direction (Godlee, 1994a, 1997; Walt, 1993). By the mid-1990s, the WHO was in a precarious financial position. In 1995, the rate of mem ber contribution collection had fallen dramatically, to the lowest rate in the hi story of the organisation and even lower than 1948, the year of its establishment. The shortfall wa s unprecedented, and 170related to the unstable economic position of some member states, but a lso expressed donor and member state dissatisfaction over policy and programme develop ment within the WHO and the lack of confidence in Nakajima (Godlee, 1994c). Nakajima, who had taken over as Director-General from Mahler in the late 1980s, was criticised as an unpopular and ineffectual leader, who left many s taff and donors unimpressed (Godlee, 1994c, 1995a). His management style and personal co mmitment to health issues differed greatly from that of Mahler. For example , Mahler had shown extraordinary ability to take political risks, entering into the advocacy arena and diplomatically balancing competing stakeholder interests while pr omoting equity in health systems development. His response to pharmaceutical lobbying an d pressure over the essential drugs scheme was to bring it into his own office and person ally oversee it, giving it strategic support, protection and higher visibility (Walt & Harnmei jer, 1992:45). In contrast, one of the first actions of Nakajima was to move it into the Drugs Pol icy and Management Division (Walt & Harnmeijer, 1992:42).66 Nakajima characterised the new direction of the organisation, whic h distanced itself from controversial or political issues and remained aloof from nati onal level health systems concerns rather than taking the lead in policy direction. Matters like TRM did not find a receptive environment in senior management, despite Nakajima pre siding over the second meeting of Directors of TRM Collaborating Centres in 1987 (as the then Director of the Western Pacific Regional Office) and espousing the merits of TRM in achieving HFA. Instead, the focus was strictly on the technical, biomedical realm and only providing guidance as requested. However, Nakajima himself did not remain unt ainted by controversy and scandal \u0096 in 1993 donors (concerned with the weakening of WHO influ ence under his guidance) took the unprecedented step of requesting Japan to withdraw his candidature for re-election. Allegations of corruption and undue political interfer ence in the nomination process were also made (Godlee, 1994c). An external audit did not subst antiate the corruption charges, but was critical of shortcomings in management ( Godlee, 1994c). This turmoil, combined with obvious failures in major policy in itiatives such as HFA and PHC created much soul searching within the organisation and a fun damental reorientation. Godlee (1994c) noted that in the absence of coherent policy and clear str ategy, the WHO 66 Nakajima had in fact been the first head of the Dr ugs Policy and Management Division, where essential d rugs was initially located (Walt & Harnmeijer, 1992:27) and had previously worked for the multinational pha rmaceutical company Hoffman La Roche (Chowdary, 1995:141). His ba ckground and experience was thus clearly in the biomedical pharmaceutical sphere. 171floundered internationally and was beset with internal conflict , low staff morale, and a deepening budgetary crisis. In this void, the World Bank (and o ther agencies including UNICEF and donor bodies) easily picked up the mantle of health policy dire ction (Zwi & Mills, 1995:313). Some critics lamented the powerlessness of the WHO, a nd its perceived inability to address social, environmental, economic or political fa ctors influencing health outcomes. Prior promotion of equity and universal health care were \u0093drowned out\u0094 by the conflicting objectives of the World Bank encouraging efficiency and econ omic growth (Godlee, 1997). Chowdary questioned whether WHO passiveness was due to fea r from donors retaliating by withdrawing funds, or from staff being compos ed primarily of biomedical doctors, which caused an adherence to: an apolitical neutral stand [in which it] refrains from m entioning colonialism, neo- colonialism and imperialism, all of which have played a si gnificant role in the causation and spread of diseases among the exploited and oppressed people of the world (C howdary, 1995:138). In 1998, Brundtland (a biomedical doctor with a Masters degree in Public Health from Harvard, Chair of the Commission which had developed the notion o f sustainable development in 1987, and previous Prime Minister of Norway) was appoint ed the new Director General. Brundtland personified how environment, sustainable development and economics had become intertwined on the international health ag enda. She immediately undertook a senior management reshuffle, restructured the organisati on and began to apply private sector approaches to public sector health priorities (Mac h, 1998), using the World Bank\u0092s controversial report Investing in Health (1993) as her \u0093roadmap\u0094 (Yamey, 2002). Brundtland emphasised the partnership with the World Bank, and e stablished a Commission on Macroeconomics and Health. A new unit was established \u0096 \u0093Evidence and I nformation for Policy\u0094 which was staffed by the authors of the Investing in Health Report, leading some to object that the WHO had become a branch of the World Bank (Yamey, 2002) . This unit produced the World Health Report 2000, which introduced the con cept of \u0093new universalism\u0094 and assessed national health systems\u0092 performance in an index. \u0093New universalism\u0094 replaced the concepts of PHC and HFA. It advocated del ivery only of essential care defined by criteria of effectiveness, cost and ac ceptability, rather than \u0093all possible care for everyone\u0094 or simple, basic care for the poor. The r anking and index of health systems performance sparked a furore as the WHO assessed he alth systems performance, and some claimed it had breached its mandate and was infringing sovereign rights of nations (Lucas, 2003). Whether the WHO will take a higher profile in guiding health systems development remains to be seen. Brundtland\u0092s refo rms and initiatives had a 172mixed reception and she stunned observers in 2002 by announcing she would not stand for re-election. 5.3.1 Progress on TRM policy and programme implementation The crisis in administration within the WHO throughout the 1990s probab ly absorbed more attention and were higher priorities than small Programmes su ch as TRM.67 While the WHO navigated its way through internal strife, financial upheaval a nd critical analysis of its performance in international public health governance, it also fac ed critics on both sides of the TRM policy divide. While implementation of integratio n remained an \u0093elusive goal\u0094 (Kennedy & Olsson, 1996:45), some castigated its lack of activity and leadership (Bodeke r, 1996:325) while others rebuked the organisation for entering the policy domain and believed it should promptly withdraw from the field even if it was not willi ng to admit any error: The WHO [TRM] drive was an erroneous approach, the helples sness of which has become apparent in the past years, and whose lack of relevance to the pressin g health problems of the world is becoming more and more obvious. It is a blind ave nue, not helping in the solution of AIDS or other multiple problems facing the Third World. However, it is r ealized that WHO will hesitate to admit this mistake because of political reasons (V elimirovic, 1992:77-78). Proclaiming the failure and futility of TRM policy in the early 1990s , as Velimirovic stated above, may have seemed plausible in light of activity in the 1980s. H owever it was premature, as towards the end of the decade and turn of the century p olicy activity intensified in relation to TRM. Headquarters produced two w orldwide reviews on the regulatory status of herbal medicines (WHO, 1998f) and legal status of TRM/CAM (WHO, 2001b). These reviews were a co-ordinated effort to clarify and develop a global overview of national activities. The review of legal status took nearly a de cade to complete, mostly due to a lack of financial resources but also due to the difficulty in ob taining accurate and current information on even basic aspects of TRM/CAM, reflecting the low pol icy status it was accorded. Only 123 of the 191 member states contributed (WHO, 2001b:ix). This intensification of policy activity was directly related to t he growing market for natural and herbal therapies in the North, which rapidly increased throughout the 1990s and showed no signs of abating. For example, in Japan, the herbal medicines mar ket doubled in only 67 \u0093 the primary concern of every bureaucracy and its pe rsonnel is the corporate survival and, if possible, the growth of the organisation, and the simultaneous pr otection of the position of staff members. Only whe n these concerns are taken care of can a bureaucracy turn f ull attention to its client group; and on those occ asions when corporate or individual survival are threatened, thi s group may receive short shrift\u0094 (Foster, 1977:531) . 173three years (it was worth US$1 billion in 1991 and US$2 billion in 1994). In the USA it tripled in five years (estimated at US$1.6 billion in 1994, US$3 billion i n 1997, and US$5.4 billion in 2000). In Arab countries, the import of herbal medicine incre ased nearly four-fold in 2001 compared with 2000 (WHO, 2002f). In the latter half of the decade, spending by consumers began to outstrip that of biomedicine in some countri es. For example, in Malaysia it was estimated that annually US$300 million was spent on biomedicine compared to US$500 million on TRM/CAM (WHO, 2002e:2). The World Bank projected that the market for herbal products would be US$3 trillion by the middle of the 21st century (Bodeker, 2000). By 2000, the economic value and trade importance of TRM forced a ra nge of regulatory and legal issues onto the agenda, discussed at an inter-regional work shop on IPR in the context of TRM (WHO, 2000c). Clarifying and establishing IPR became crucial in order to stake claims on secondary resources (economic benefits) generated from this surge in sales of TRM/CAM primary resources (plants, herbs). The introduction to the report of the workshop noted that there was an \u0093increasing awareness of the value of traditional knowledge and biodiversity resources as economic and tradable commodities. This, coupled with the impact of the (TRIPS Agreement) on pharmaceuticals, including [TRM] neces sitates this meeting\u0094 (WHO, 2000c:1.1). TRM was considered the foremost area driving the IPR agenda in the field of traditional knowledge (WHO, 2000c:1.1). TRIPS and trade issues had a significant impact on both TRM and the essential drugs scheme, and b ecame inherently linked with the fate of these programmes throughout the decade. The Western Pacific Regional Office publications also became mor e directly focussed on policy and regulatory aspects. Development of National Policy on Trad itional Medicine (WHO, 2000a) and Traditional and Modern Medicine: Harmonizing the Two Approaches (WHO, 2000d) were published as reports of consultations held in China in O ctober and November 1999. These activities were supplemented with internatio nal symposiums held in Japan, sponsored by a new WHO Centre. The WHO Kobe Centre for Health De velopment was established in 1998 to conduct research into the health consequence s of social, economic, environmental and technological changes and their implications for health policies. In this capacity, it took an active interest in TRM and publi shed the proceedings of meetings exploring policy, services and utilisation (WHO, 2000e, 2001a, 2001c). This flurry of activity between 1999 and 2001 culminated in the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2002-2005 (WHO, 2002e), which is explored in the subsequent chapter and referre d to as the TRM Strategy . The documents produced throughout the 1990s are discussed in more detail below, along with WHO activities in relation to TRM. In the analysis of 174developments, it will be demonstrated that the WHO activity was c learly linked to the rising economic weight of TRM in the global trade arena and unregulated hea lth care sector, and efforts to moderate, control or oversee this growth. The issue of newly discovered or imported primary resources in tensifies conflict, as it ignites a battle for control (Unschuld, 1975:311), and administratively the W HO (while placing itself as a neutral arbiter) is operating from a biomedical perspe ctive thus forming a de-facto alliance with the biomedical coalition. The remainder of this ch apter is structured in the same way as the previous chapters, assessing the WHO activities in rel ation to traditional medicine in discrete policy areas \u0096 1) traditional birth attendants, 2) resol utions, and 3) programme development including: a. TRM Programme, b. essential drugs and c . PHC. 5.3.1:1) Traditional birth attendants A joint statement on TBAs was released by the WHO, UNFPA and UNICE F in 1992. This appeared to acknowledge the limitations on training of TBAs, and also pas s the mantle onto other organisations for future work.68 Guidelines for training TBAs were published in the same year (WHO, 1992b, 1992c, 1992d). Apart from this activity early in the dec ade, TBAs appeared to totally disappear off the agenda and no meetings were hel d or publications produced solely by the WHO in relation to this type of TRM practit ioner throughout the rest of the 1990s. What had been one of the initial focal points for the WHO in the T RM field in the 1970s had no profile at all two decades later. This shifting focus w as referred to at the third meeting of Directors of the TRM Collaborating Centres: [I]n the light of the recognized successes of the Tradit ional Birth Attendants and Traditional Bone Setters, it is now time to redirect our e fforts to promote the use of traditional herbal medicines and acupuncture (WHO, 1996e:54). The reasons for the diminished role of TBAs in the TRM Programm e can only be speculated upon. In the face of budgetary restrictions, those programmes difficult to quantify or evaluate may have been the first to be scaled back. Other agencies with a di rect or specific interest in maternal and child health (such as UNICEF and UNFPA) may have taken t his objective on board. It appears unlikely that the reason as stated (\u0093mission accomplished\u0094) is the rationale, 68 \u0093Training of TBAs cannot be used as a single appro ach to improving maternal and child health care. Wit hout implementation of appropriate technologies and stre ngthening of referral and s upport systems, TBA training alone cannot contribute to a substantial improvement in h ealth care. Furthermore, trained TBAs cannot be expe cted to reduce overall mortality and morbidity rates when pov erty, illiteracy and discrimination \u0096 the underlying c auses of these problems \u0096 are not addressed.\u0094 (WHO, 1992a:15) 175as there is no evidence presented of any recognised and sustained succes ses. One study found little outcome evaluation studies, concluding that benefic ial impacts of training TBAs was not \u0093compelling\u0094 and suggesting alternative investments and more r ealism about the impact of programmes (Smith et al., 2000). A combination of budgetary re strictions, shifting priorities and difficulty implementing and evaluating such programm es may be a more realistic explanation of lack of focus on TBAs by the WHO in the 1990s. 5.3.2:2) Resolutions In 1991, the Executive Board recommended that the World Health Assembl y adopt a resolution on TRM and modern health care (EB87.R24). This resoluti on was adopted (WHA44.34), although with slight modifications from the resolution of the Executive Board. It also noted that increased funding was required to enable TRM \u0093 to take its rightful place in health care\u0094 and requested member states to introduce mea sures for the regulation and control of acupuncture. The wording of resolutions and debate surroundi ng them reflects that the World Health Assembly, Executive Board, member states , and the WHO management and administration operate according to divergent political a nd economic influences and priorities. These interests can be moderated via various mechan isms such as through debate on resolutions and their wording, internal resource allocation, pol icy and programme development and implementation both within the organisation an d on national levels. 5.3.2:2a) Resolution WHA44.34 (1991) This resolution recalled the previous resolutions in relation to TR M, acknowledged the importance of TRM to health care, the potential medical and econom ic value of plant substances, and the fact that many medicinal plants were threaten ed by ecological and environmental changes. Both economic and environmental concerns were dual factors pushing TRM consideration, and the emphasis shifted from an almost exclusive focus on manpower to one of medicinal plants (and acupuncture). Member states were urged to increase funding and accelerate acti vities to strengthen co- operation between TRM and biomedical health care providers, particul arly in relation to the use of \u0093 scientifically proven , safe and effective traditional remedies to reduce national dr ug costs\u0094 and the regulation and control of acupuncture. The Director -General was requested to continue to recognise the importance of the TRM Programme and to \u0093e nsure that the contribution of scientifically proven traditional medicine is fu lly exploited within all of the WHO programmes where plant derived and other natural products may l ead to the discovery 176of new therapeutic substances\u0094.69 TRM practitioners considered as manpower to extend basic health care services were diminished in importance in comp arison to the 1970s, and became almost invisible. The economic value of TRM remedies was paramount \u0096 t hey could potentially reduce the cost of health care in the South while providing exploitable biomedical pharmaceuticals for the North. This trend continued the focus from previous years, but inflated phytotherapy (ethnobotany) above manpower considerations. 5.3.2:3) Programme development and promotion Throughout the 1990s, the TRM programme, essential drugs scheme and PHC a ll had various successes and failures. By the turn of the century, PHC and TRM as discrete organisational objectives ceased to exist. In contrast, essentia l drugs took a more prominent role. The WHO appeared to conceive of TRM purely as an adjunct to essential drugs (as it had to PHC earlier in the decade). This view considered TRM only fr om the perspective as to how it could be utilised primarily as a source of pharmacologically active raw materials, and \u0093overlooks the potential for wider involvement and appears not to valu e ancient and well-documented traditions and knowledge of [TRM] which may be a ble to manage some chronic and debilitating disorders better than [biomedicine]\u0094 (Bodeke r & Bichan, 1996:395). 5.3.2:3a) Traditional Medicine Programme The TRM Programme had been moved into the newly established Drugs Policy and Management Division in the late 1980s (Akerele, 1988:359), alongside essentia l drugs. Later, TRM was located within the Department of Essential Dr ugs and Medicine Policy. The downgrading of the TRM Programme may have been undertaken as part of t he general administrative and organisational re-structuring of the WHO, prom pted by their financial and management crisis. According to the WHO, this administrative change signalled \u0093the importance of plants as sources of products of medicinal value\u0094 ( Zhang, 1994:141). It also reflected the subordinate status of TRM to biomedical authori ty, and a technical, biomedical, reductionist view on TRM systems. The TRM Programme was subject to a progress report in 1991, a revie w of activities in the African Region in 1993, and was due for its first formal evaluation a t the WHO Executive 69 Only 1 100 of the earth\u0092s 265 000 species of plant s had been studied by scientists, and as many as 40 000 of them may have medicinal or nutritional value (accordin g to the Director of the New York Botanical Garden\u0092 s Institute of Economic Botany) (Dharmasiri, 1997:175). Plants form the basis of many prescription medicines, betw een 1959 and 1980 approximately 25% of all prescriptions in th e US contained material from plants (Farnsworth & S oejarto, 1985). 177Board meeting in January 1996.70 The 1991 progress report by the Director General appeared to sanction a more restrained stance on TRM, and was a marked dif ference in attitude to Mahler whom he had recently replaced: there are limits to the scope of the WHO TRM Programme. It receives innumerable requests which, if acted upon, would involve it in activitie s for which it is not prepared or which are contrary to its objectives. WHO is often asked to san ction all kinds of traditional and alternative medicine practices, many of which are of h ighly dubious value and some of which are outright dangerous (Nakajima, Director General of W HO in 1991 progress report on the TRM Programme, in Velimirovic, 1992:77). The first formal evaluation was foremost in the minds of those attending the meeting of Directors of TRM Collaborating Centres in late 1995, and they were r eminded that the outcomes of that meeting would be of great importance in determini ng the fate of the TRM Programme (WHO, 1996e:6). However, no record of the evaluation at that Executive Board meeting, or any subsequent meetings, could be located. The TRM Progr amme was only mentioned by a representative of the World Federation of Proprietary Medicine Manufacturers, which had an obvious commercial interest in promotin g the use and distribution of non-prescription medicines. He was impressed with the efforts and achievements of the Programme, particularly the development of guidelines for herbal medicines.71 In light of increasing international trade that demanded standard isation, he hoped that this importance would be reflected in future financ ing of the Programme (WHO, 1996a). Despite such appeals and the resolution of 1991 calling for increased acti vity and co- ordination, throughout this decade the TRM Programme was progressi vely scaled back in staff and financial input, with a total budget of only US$180 000 in 1996 (Bodeke r & Bichan, 1996:395). In the budget for 1996-1997 it was proposed to reduce the activit ies at headquarters in relation to TRM. The lowering priority of TRM wit hin the WHO in the mid- 1990s seemed to paradoxically correspond with the increasing gl obal functional strength of TRM/CAM. The TRM Programme had already been weakened by the lack of a d edicated and permanent Programme Director, following the retirement of Akerele in the early 1990s. Akerele was replaced with Dr. Zhang, in an acting (temporary) co-ordinating r ole and the position of Director was downgraded to programme officer. Emasculated by mi nimal funding, the TRM 70 None of these progress reports or evaluations (199 1, 1993, 1996) could be located. 71 In 1989 this group (WFPMM) had collaborated with the TRM Programme in a working party on herbal medicines, which led to the development of guidelin es for their assessment. 178Programme now also lacked a senior advocate ( policy entrepreneur ) within the Organisation. The discrete re-shuffling of programmes resulted in \u0093almost sile ntly\u0094 placing TRM in Drug Policies and Management where it was \u0093dying a slow death\u0094 (Ventevoge l 1996 in van der Geest, 1997:904). The low priority given to TRM at WHO Headquarters was c onsidered indicative of a lack of international leadership in this policy f ield despite the massive growth in popularity of TRM/CAM, and the WHO instead left a \u0093vac uum in the face of a vast plebiscite [in favour of it]\u0094 (Bodeker, 1996:325). The scope of the programme became more tightly defined in the 1990s, which is evide nt in the report of the third meeting of the Collaborating Centres for TRM ( WHO, 1996e). A focus on activities related to the dual priorities of medicinal plants and acupuncture was mentioned at least half a dozen times throughout the body of this report. They w ere considered significant areas that efforts should be directed towards, as they were the \u0093most important\u0094 to national health services (WHO, 1996e:5, 11, 26, 28, 53, 54). While manpower a nd training received attention in the 1970s, in the 1980s an emphasis on herbal medicines was obvious, and this now also explicitly included acupuncture. This was not completely unforeseen, considering the referen ces to acupuncture from the initial technical report on traditional medicine (WHO, 1978b), the recommendations of the second meeting of Directors of Collaborating Centres (WHO, 1988: 17) which encouraged acupuncture alongside herbal medicines, and the resolution in 1991 (WHA44.34). The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific had convened meetings on acupun cture since 1981, and produced a series of documents on standardising acupuncture nomenc lature as well as testing, training and (Bergstrom Mocumbi, 1996; WHO, 1984, 1991b, 1991c, 1993b, 1999, 2002a). These meetings and publications had the goal of standardis ing acupuncture for global application, as well as encouraging clinical st udies to validate it and improve \u0093its acceptability to modern medicine thus extending its use as a simple, inexpensive and effective therapeutic option\u0094 (Bergstrom & Mocu mbi, 1996). The guidelines were designed to assist in training programmes for biomed ical practitioners who wished to adopt acupuncture as a clinical practice (WHO, 1999), a proc ess which could be seen to support and promote the trend for biomedicine to absorb it into their therapeutic range. The elevation of acupuncture alongside herbal remedies as a WHO Pro gramme priority can be considered a coup for the Chinese government, which had energeticall y promoted the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture since the 1970s. Now the WHO was en couraging and assisting the global dissemination of this particular treat ment modality, specific to traditional 179Chinese medicine (TCM). There can be a number of reasons co njectured for this development. Clearly, the influence of the Chinese government on programme and policy development on TRM within the WHO may be considered a factor. Beyond i nspiring the initial promotion of TRM on an international level, it continued to host and sponsor meetings, exchanges of health professionals and to actively prom ote the merits of TCM.72 In addition, acupuncture had received great clinical interest and sci entific validation for treatment of certain conditions, which provided legitimacy to biomedi cal practitioners. According to the WHO, the efficacy of acupuncture to treat conditions such as pain and nausea had been \u0093conclusively demonstrated and acknowledged worldwide\u0094 ( WHO, 2002e:23). Acupuncture also shared techniques common to biomedical prima ry resources (needles), despite the underlying philosophy of energy meridians bei ng completely outside the boundaries of the Western scientific paradigm. Finally, by the 1990s , acupuncture had become increasingly popular in the North and therefore generated sec ondary resources that biomedical practitioners were keen to access and therefore incorpo rate into their practice (Easthope et al., 1998; Easthope, Tranter, & Gill, 2001; Saks, 1992b, 1995b) .73 This specific interest in acupuncture was reflected in the WHO TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e), which made over a dozen references to acupuncture as opposed to two pas sing references to spiritual therapies and four similarly negligibl e references to manual therapies. Amongst all therapeutic techniques used in TRM, acupuncture was succ essfully promoted as a pre-eminent treatment modality and the only one endorsed by th e WHO for global transfer. This illustrates the trend Lee (1982) observes \u0096 that a TRM therap y (e.g. acupuncture) may try to increase structural strength through the adoption of scientif ic discourse and professionalisation, but that this ultimately facilitates abso rption within biomedical systems (which in turn serves to further increase the structural strength o f biomedicine). How this endorsement was regarded in other regions, such as Afric a or the Eastern Mediterranean, is not clear. It appears to move beyond the boundaries o f the TRM Programme as initially proposed and espoused at the PHC meeting in Al ma Ata, which was to encourage the use of local resources to supplement health care. While the attention given to acupuncture can be traced to the 1978 technical report on TRM, it had n ot been singled 72 The success of the Chinese promotion of TCM was re cognised by competitors: \u0093China has achieved officia l recognition of acupuncture treatment and has succes sfully captured a large chunk of the herbal medicine market in the US. It is high time the government of India, Ay urvedic medical community and the Ayurvedic industry aggressively seize the opportunity and make a mark in the frontiers of medicine\u0094 (Shah, 2003). 73 In Switzerland, nearly 50% of biomedical doctors h ad used some form of CAM \u0096 mainly acupuncture and homeopathy, in Belgium 74% of acupuncture treatment was administered by biomedical practitioners, and in the UK 46% of biomedical doctors either used acupuncture o r recommended it to patients (WHO, 2002e:11-12). 180out but mentioned as only one among various TRM treatments considere d to have therapeutic merit. Other therapies and TRM systems mentioned in that report included moxibustion, Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and yoga. It appeared that the very trend that the technical report had warned against \u0096 that of reducing the therape utic value of TRM to medicinal plants (WHO, 1978b:10) had materialised, with the addition only of acupuncture as a treatment modality. China actively capitalised on the endorsement of and interest in a cupuncture. For example, The WHO Collaborating Centre in Beijing sent instructors to Chile, India, Japan, Mauritius, Papua New Guinea, Spain and Turkey to train biomedical doctors, and held various courses which trained over 2500 people from 70 different countries (WHO, 1996e:40). Four Collaborating Centres were significantly or solely devoted to cl inical research in acupuncture, demonstrating its scientific basis and effectivene ss in biomedical terms (particularly as an analgesic). For example, areas of research inc luded identifying the scientific basis of yang and yin deficiency (WHO, 1996e:45) and control led biomedical studies on the validity and strength of various acupuncture points (WH O, 1996e:47). The third meeting of the Directors of the Collaborating Centres on TRM was held in China in 1995 (WHO, 1996e). Only 17 of the 25 Directors could attend, due to financial s tringency. The Report did not publish the full details of their activities, but inst ead chose only to include selected excerpts due to constraints of space (WHO, 1996e:31-52). Regional activities were also reported on, but only from the African, Ea stern Mediterranean and Western Pacific Regions (WHO, 1996e:17-30); reflecting the geographic d istribution of TRM systems still heavily patronised by populations. The reports of the collaborating centres and regional offices are nota ble for their heavy use of biomedical and scientific discourse to describe their activi ties and outcomes. The biomedical effectiveness of TRM was considered necessary to ensure its role in health care systems (WHO, 1996e:25), enhancing its acceptance and improving its applic ation (WHO, 1996e:28). None of the Centres made reference to policy or health system iss ues, or regulatory issues related to TRM in their reports of activiti es. Activities were almost exclusively centred on screening, identifying, extracting and t esting plant compounds. This tone was set in the progress report from China, the only single country to pr esent a report which was provided as part of the preparatory statements. This als o reflected the paramount position achieved by China in guiding and setting parameters of discus sion. In 1987, TCM had been proclaimed the \u0093most highly developed\u0094 of TRM systems in the Western Pacific 181Region (WHO, 1988:39), a status practitioners of other systems (such as A yurveda) may have found contentious. In the presentation from China, achievements were couched in ter ms of what TRM had contributed to biomedicine. The biomedical terminology is so profuse tha t large sections of the report would be incomprehensible to a lay-person or most TRM p ractitioners74 and Chinese remedies were translated into and ranked against a biomedical framework. The adoption of scientific techniques (such as extraction and artific ial synthesis of compounds, artificial cultivation, classification and examination for quality control) were viewed as promoting TRM. Future development and accomplishments were consi dered possible with collaboration from scientists (WHO, 1996e:10). Efforts to increas e yield, standardise and simplify cultivation, genetically modify and selectively br eed plants to reduce variability and produce more uniform raw materials, and standardise and regulate ac tive ingredients were both necessitated by and facilitated further industrial product ion and commercialisation of TRM. The growing nexus between science, technology, TRM and market imperatives can be illustrated with the Chinese progress report (WHO, 1996e:7-10) whic h described their policy to promote scientific research of TRM, and the transfer of this research into pragmatic outcomes including economic benefits. This policy was an extremely inventive approach that tied salary and professional status and prestige (secondary res ources) to contributions made to scientific research projects. Operating on a five year cyc le, the state determined and assigned key projects to various groups, supported by a science fund. The research outcomes were then ranked according to academic value and profits obta ined, and were accordingly awarded honours of different grades. Salaries were linked to the contributions of individuals to the awarded projects, and it was noted that this initiative had spu rred the expansion of scientific research institutes and personnel.75 Most of the recognised achievements used Western scientific m ethods (including biomedicine) and were based on clinically analysing and systemati sing TRM (WHO, 74 semi- synthesised into 654-2. The latter is comparable in effectiveness to the natural 654 in the treatment of fulminating epidemic encephalo-spinal meningitis An anti-chol inergic drug, anisodine hydrobromate, for oral or p erenteral administration, has been prepared. It is effective i n vaso-spastic conditions (e.g., central retinipathi es, obstructive cerebro-vascular disorders ) Huperzine A, a new Huperzina serrata (Thunb) Trev. and Pinus massoniana Lamb., which were screened from more than 3000 diff erent Chinese medicinal herbs, is superior thenia gravis. Biphenyl-dimethyl-dicarboxylate and Sc hizandrol, designed to the pharmacologi cal actions of Fructus Schizandrae are indicated for chronic hepatitis \u0094 (WHO, 1996e:8). 75 At the end of 1994, there were over 10 000 profess ional technicians, and 170 TCM institutions which in cluded 77 independent scientific research institutions. Over 1300 prizes had been awarded (WHO, 1996e:7). 1821996e:7-8). Both TCM and biomedicine were therefore sharing secondar y resources (status, economic benefits), although the status of TCM was defined only in r elation to biomedical parameters. Therefore their primary resource base was indirectl y controlled by biomedical practitioners, and secondary resources contingent upon conformity to biomedical standards and frameworks. This use of Western science to validate and \u0093modernise\u0094 TCM appear ed to have ultimately aided in its successful global export (especially as this fac ilitated industrial production and regulatory compliance). For example, the use of scientific ap proaches had enabled quality control, so that TCM products could enter the international ma rket and compete with other botanical products (particularly in Europe) (Eskinazi & Mindes, 2001: 21). Whatever the origins or motivations of this technique, demonstrating scientific validity was most successfully embodied by the Chinese government. It made an extraor dinary political and financial commitment to this mission, which was now paying fina ncial dividends as TCM became the most widely exported TRM system. While this strat egy may have resulted in domestic economic savings in the form of low cost health services from the 1950s to the 1970s, between the 1980s and 1990s it also generated considerable revenue. In 1995, th ere were 1500 factories processing raw plant materials and nearly 700 facto ries producing patent TCM remedies, exported to more than 100 countries (WHO, 1996e:30) and generating US$1.8 billion in annual sales within China alone (see Chaudhury, 1992; WH O, 1996e:27). Other regions and collaborating centres were less active and profi table, and were severely constrained by a lack of funds. Headquarters was not providing financ ial support (WHO, 1996e:12), and the Collaborating Centres were urged to become self-suff icient or seek funds from their respective national governments (WHO, 1996e:53) or even exter nal donors. The WHO identified one role in relation to TRM as guiding the Centres t o locate financial assistance from other agencies (WHO, 1996e:54). The African region noted that their funds were inadequate to meet the challenges posed in terms of requests f or policy assistance from member states (WHO, 1996e:17). In Nigeria, medicinal plants had not been pharmacologically screened due to the lack of funds for extract ion (WHO, 1996e:33). The Western Pacific region also mentioned the need for financial ass istance (WHO, 1996e:30). National level activity is discussed in more detail later in the chapter (section 5.5), with a general observation here that the Collaborating Centre reports an d regional activities demonstrated the extremely wide variability on national levels in both political commitment and financial support. While 25 centres were operating in 1996, thi s had contracted to 19 Centres by 2002. Nigeria, Sudan, India and two European Centres had al l either ceased 183operating or were no longer affiliated with the WHO, leaving the E astern Mediterranean Region unrepresented, and South East Asia with one Centre. Meanwhil e, over 60% of the Centres were located in the Western Pacific Region with 7 alone in China.76 There were no further meetings of the Directors of Collaborating Centres following the downgrade in TRM Programme status, with a total of only three meeti ngs in 25 years of operation. At least a dozen meetings would have been held in the same period if the meeting schedule initially proposed had been adhered to. This can be interpr eted as reflecting the low priority of TRM within the Organisation, although some may furthe r contend that it (whether inadvertently or deliberately) served to weaken and fragment TRM collaboration and centralise policy power in China, which had benefited from a dominant position in TRM policy development from inception. In the meantime, while AIDS remained an urgent health problem a nd absorbed increasing amounts of funding and attention, the direct association between HIV/AIDS and the TRM Programme (as mentioned in the previous chapter) became tenuous . The initial efforts at using TRM remedies or practitioners (WHO, 1989b, 1990b, 1990c) did not transl ate into a solid programme objective during the 1990s. AIDS became a huge priority w ithin the WHO, and grew to the single largest programme by the mid-1990s account ing for a third of the organisations entire budget (Peabody, 1995:731). However, in 1993 the United Nation s removed the Global AIDS Programme out of the sole control of the WHO, and it became a multi-agency programme jointly managed by the WHO and two othe r United Nations bodies (the UN Development Programme and the UN Population Fund). This wa s interpreted by some as a vote of no-confidence in the WHO, and in its ability to tack le complex health issues while operating from such a narrow technical base (Godlee, 1994a: 1493) \u0096 a factor which may also be relevant in explaining difficulties the organi sation faced in addressing the role of TRM in health care systems. The fact that the Global AIDS Programme was no longer under the sole purv iew of the WHO may be a factor for the lack of co-ordination between it and oth er WHO Programmes, such as the TRM Programme. The budgetary restrictions of the TRM Progr amme and its downgraded status within the WHO could also explain a reduced role . The co-operation required between TRM and biomedical practitioners to clinically explore TRM remedies may also have been difficult to encourage and sustain. For w hatever reason, AIDS and TRM 76 The regional breakdown of Collaborating Centres wa s Africa (3), Americas (2), Europe (1), South East Asia (1) and Western Pacific (12) (WHO, 2002e:49). 184did not continue to be directly linked within the WHO as earlier demons trated, in terms of clinical screening for potential treatments or programme devel opment using TRM practitioners in prevention or support efforts.77 However, AIDS did continue to impact on TRM systems of health on national levels. For example, many people a fflicted with AIDS sought treatment from TRM practitioners, and a lack of affordab le and accessible biomedical treatments encouraged people to desperately seek altern ative remedies. Surveys revealed that over three-quarters of AIDS patients in Africa, North America and Europe used traditional or complementary medicine for various symptoms (WHO, 2002f). This new demand for TRM had broader and unanticipated impacts \u0096 for example , stocks of wild African potato ( Hypoxis hemerocallidea ) were threatened with extinction after it received publicity as an AIDS treatment (WHO, 2002e:25), and TRM/CAM remedies interacted in sometimes negative and dangerous ways with biomedic al treatments for AIDS (WHO, 2002e:27).78 It was argued that despite a lack of official recognition, TRM was carrying the burden of the AIDS epidemic in the South and this role was be ing overlooked by national governments and international agencies (editorial, 2002a; WHO, 2002e:13). Some countries and agencies did see the potential for greater co -ordination between TRM and biomedical practitioners, albeit belatedly and without direct gui dance or assistance from the WHO (see Burford et al., 2000). For example, in South Africa TRM practitioners were trained in AIDS diagnosis and biomedical referral, while they provided psychological and spiritual support (du Venage, 2003). The AIDS Foundation in South Africa (a non-governmental organisat ion) trained over 6000 local practitioners in this role, which was only a small part of the \u0093informal hospice\u0094 TRM practitioners often offered to AIDS patients \u0096 including food, shelt er, compassion, and even caring for children left orphaned. Dispensing anti-retrovir al drugs was considered the ultimate goal, but one that seemed distant (du Venage, 2003). This wa s probably not only due to the demonstrated general reluctance of biomedicine to share its primary resource base with TRM practitioners, but also because of the expense and limited supply of these drugs in the South due to patent and intellectual property rights disputes (di sputed access to secondary resources). The pharmaceutical monopoly on production a nd pricing limited the 77 The joint programme on AIDS did explore the use of TRM practitioners later in the decade (UNAIDS, 1999) - after AIDS became a joint UN programme and not the sole r esponsibility of WHO. 78 For example, if an AIDS patient was taking the herb St John\u0092s Wort and also taking indinavir (an HIV pr otease inhibitor), the levels of indinavir in the blood woul d be reduced to below the level required to block HIV multiplication (WHO, 2002e:27). The trend to \u0093pick and mix\u0094 treatment s from biomedicine and TRM/CAM could therefore result in unanticipated health consequences. The primary resou rce bases of TRM/CAM and biomedicine were not always compatible. 185potential for generic drugs to be cheaply produced and supplied, and the need for an affordable alternative became even more pressing. Aside from environmental threats posed by uncontrolled harvesting o f plants to meet the escalating need for alternatives, there were also economic thre ats and challenges. There was a serious concern about the commercial potential to patent plant r emedies that would ultimately price them beyond the financial reach of communities (Bodeke r, 2000; WHO, 2002c:17). For example, African communities feared that another indi genous plant that offered a cheap, natural AIDS treatment ( Sutherlandia frutescens microphylla ) could be patented by drugs companies (Independent, 2001). A month\u0092s supply of this dr ug cost only US$2.50, but if patented it would be subject to the monopoly pricing of other pharmaceuticals and thus out of reach of the communities it coul d effectively treat. In seeking to maximise secondary resources (economic benefits ), pharmaceutical companies were therefore restricting access to primary resources (drugs) - ironically to the very communities who may have been the original custodians of those re sources and in most need of them. Biomedical capitalisation of TRM knowledge and primary resources wa s a threat that TRM practitioners were aware of in the initial consultations held on A IDS, which was why some practitioners were possessive of their remedies and decided to keep t hem secret (WHO, 1990c:37). So in protecting their own primary and secondary resources, t hey were also preventing the broader distribution of such remedies through biomedical c hannels. The secondary resources attached to treating HIV/AIDS were signifi cant. For example, Ethiopian women who had used plants to treat AIDS-related opportunisti c infections received both financial and political benefits, with some achieving the position of community leader (Burford et al., 2000:10). AIDS was mentioned in the TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e), so indirectly it was a factor that forced TRM back on the agenda even though this relationship ap peared neglected by the WHO throughout the decade. While the WHO TRM Programme did not take an a ctive role in AIDS prevention and cure, malaria assumed a greater importan ce. Although research on anti-malarials was undertaken in the 1980s (WHO, 1988:41), the prominence give n to it increased in the 1990s, evidenced in the Report of the third meeting of Di rectors of Collaborating Centres. It is mentioned frequently (WHO, 1996e:5, 8, 32, 37, 41), and listed 186as a distinct area of activity in three centres.79 It had re-emerged as an important public health issue due to the development of strains of malaria that were resistant to standard biomedical treatments (primary resources), while the natural s ource of these synthetic biomedical compounds was still effective (Bodeker, 1994b:12). By 2004, biomedical treatments were 90% ineffective, deaths from malaria were esti mated by some to be over 2 million per year and it was consuming up to 40% of African health budgets ( Henderson, 2004). TRM was still being widely used to combat malaria. In Ghana, Ma li, Nigeria and Zambia, herbal medicine was the first line of treatment for more than 60 % of children with malarial fever, and clinical studies on anti-malarial herbal medicines show ed they could remove the parasites within one week (WHO, 2002f). In Ghana and Kenya, biomedical a ntimalarials cost several dollars (when total per capita out of pocket health exp enditure annually was US$6) while the cost of self-treatment with herbs was estimated a t 10c. Payment in kind was also possible in TRM health systems (WHO, 2002e:13). What had been emphasised in the 1970s was st ill relevant in the 1990s - TRM was more affordable, accessible and appropriate for many communities in the South, and may of fer a viable alternative to treat some intractable problems. Ironically, malaria eradication programmes had failed in the 1970s due to increasing DDT resistance (now banned for environmental reasons) and lack of biomedic al infrastructure, and this was one of the failures that had originally pushed PHC onto the a genda (Mull, 1990:28; Newell, 1988:903; Walt, 1994). Two decades later, malaria again defeat ed biomedical vertical interventions (such as the roll-back mal aria campaign), and inspired the push to look for alternative, cheaper and more effective solution s that cast TRM back under the biomedical gaze. However, in this case, it was to be used for the develo pment of more potent pharmaceuticals rather than in delivering comprehensive, pr eventative community based health care (drugs, not manpower or public health campaigns). In comparison to the new emphasis on malaria, a passing referen ce to AIDS was made by only one Collaborating Centre, which acted as a clearing house for sec ondary information, and was not involved in clinical testing. Both AIDS and malaria w ere mentioned with an almost equal number of references in the TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e), and were the only 79 A new anti-malarial drug had been developed from a TCM remedy ( Artemisia annua ) and this was now being commercially produced in Europe following a licensi ng agreement with the Chinese government, a feat th ey were proud of on both economic and medical grounds. In 2 004, another (cheaper, synthetic) anti-malarial dru g was developed from the same TCM remedy (Henderson, 2004). 187medical conditions to receive a separate listing in the index and the strat egy objectives. AIDS and malaria represented a large burden of disease in the Sou th, were the two leading causes of mortality and were crippling national health systems a nd economies \u0096 making them priority areas for TRM (Bodeker, 2001c:46). In sub-Saharan Africa in 1999, there were 6,027 deaths a day due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and 2,345 deaths a day du e to malaria (with 8,181 deaths a day from diarrhoea) (Burford et al., 2000:13). They w ere still inadequately addressed by biomedical primary resources \u0096 as were many other diseases, which required access to either essential drugs or cheaper local ly produced alternatives. What the history of HIV/AIDS and malaria demonstrated was that f or some conditions, neither biomedicine nor TRM were independently fully effective.80 Both systems required an interaction and co-operation with the other to tackle problematic public health issues. 5.3.2:3b) Essential Drugs Scheme The focus of the WHO in the TRM field was most clearly illustrated by the TRM Programme\u0092s absorption within the Department of Essential Drugs and Medicine Policy. At first glance, the link between these areas may not be obvious and TRM and essential drugs may even appear inherently contradictory. However, the genesis of both programmes was common and they were originally linked in intent. In the 1970s, these programmes derived from the objective of encouraging the development of low cost health serv ices in the South, equity of access, and rationality in resource allocation. They wer e all members of the PHC family, and interlinked spokes of the WHO policy platform that evolved in the 1970s to achieve HFA by the year 2000. The programmes were closely related \u0096 the initial essential dr ugs report recommended that \u0093the benefits and safety of traditional medicines, including me dicinal plants\u0094 be evaluated (1977:18), and therefore TRM was always meant to be one aspect of the ess ential drugs approach. The common ground between them was the development of c heaper, culturally appropriate plant based alternatives to treat preventable health conditions in the South. They were both directed to achieving affordable, accessible and ap propriate health care, the principles of PHC in operation. However, the international regulat ory environment was not conducive to the development and use of natural products (TRM) as essential drugs 80 It could be argued that family planning and materna l/child health initiatives of the 1970s, which were an original impetus propelling TRM onto the health care agenda, demonstrated the same thing. In the North, chronic diet and lifestyle related conditions (such as obesity, diabe tes, heart disease, anxiety, stress and depression), and conditions associated with aging, also demonstrate this. All r equire a focus on health education, prevention and/ or psycho- social support mechanisms. While clinical intervent ions may also be necessary; prevention, education and support (of which TRM/CAM systems focus) are equally or more im portant aspects. A focus on upstream, not downstrea m approaches may prove more effective in the long-term . 188(Bodeker, 1996:325). For example, over two decades of medicinal plant resear ch in Africa had not led to the development of a single medicine produced for nat ional distribution (Burford et al., 2000:7) and the WHO did not show any interest in enco uraging the necessary research in this area (Chaudhury, 1992:79). The apparent co-ordination between the two programmes within the WHO in the intervening years had also not been strong. There is little reference in TRM programme documentation to essential drugs, and vice versa. This is also reflected on com mentary on the essential drugs programme. For example Drugs Policy in Developi ng Countries (Kanji et al., 1992) analysed the implementation of this policy on national levels, but only referred to TRM in the context of TRM practitioners misusing biomedical drugs such as antibiotics (Kanji & Hardon, 1992:102). Essential drugs policy certainly had a higher profile, and was ge nerally restricted in interpretation to pharmaceuticals. While essential drugs expanded its ambit and grew more robust over time, eventually celebrating 25 years in operation, the adoption of the concept in over 150 countries and even its own newsletter (WHO, 2003a), the TRM Progr amme progressively atrophied and was eventually subsumed by its thrivi ng sibling. This may have been partly related to the nature of the WHO as an orga nisation, which was more comfortable and familiar with essential drugs as a concept . It was easily quantified, evaluated and implemented and a more compatible match wit h the technical, vertical, biomedical foundation of the WHO. In addition, as mentioned in the prev ious chapter, a bleak economic environment dominated by neo-liberal philosophies relea sed contradictory forces which affected the evolution of these programmes differently. While such an environment was a positive force for the essential drugs concept, it w as negative for TRM and community based health care approaches more broadly. These same restrictive economic conditions meant that at community levels, people who were unable to afford or access biomedicine (under privatised healt h systems) resorted to TRM. For example, a survey in Abidjan, Cote d\u0092Ivoire found that 13.5% of households had replaced biomedicine with TRM for health care after the Ivoria n franc was devalued, and in some regions of Africa people used TRM more often after the introducti on of user fees for previously free government biomedical services (Bodeker, 1996:324; Bodeker, 2001c :54; Tsey, insurance schemes for biome dical services can also lead to the uninsured seeking more TRM services (Bodeker, 2001c:57) \u0096 r eimbursement or subsidies under private and public insurance schemes affects access t o and utilisation of TRM/CAM in complex ways (Bodeker, 2001c:57-58). 189This example illustrates the multidimensional nature of the f actors linking these policy fields, and operating in a sometimes conflicting fashion. While TRM received less political and economic support at international and national levels, on comm unity levels it was being sustained as a pragmatic response to the operational failures of the higher profile programmes \u0096 essential drugs, and the struggling PHC concept. Neo-li beral health policies which flourished internationally during the 1980s and 1990s caused a con traction of biomedical services and encouraged TRM use for practical economic grounds at the local level. The increasing cost of modern drugs coupled with the declin e in the purchasing power of the African people caused by the weakening of the African curre ncies and the limited national resources make it mandatory that efforts should be intensi fied to produce drugs from plants in Africa (Sofowora, 1996:371). While the essential drugs programme was an organisational succe ss, fully achieving its objectives remained elusive. In 2002, about a third of the world\u0092 s population, and 50% in Asia and Africa, lacked regular access to essential drugs (WHO , 2002d:3). Paradoxically, this very failure assisted in forcing TRM back onto the agenda, and f or exactly the same reasons present in the 1970s. People in the South were dying from preventa ble diseases, the distribution and supply of biomedical facilities (primary resources ) had proven inadequate to meet their needs, costs were escalating and communities we re using TRM regardless of whether this was officially mandated or regulated. Why the essential drugs programme failed to really redress the ineq uities in supply and delivery is a separate (although related) issue that cannot be ful ly addressed here. Again it is associated with entrenched vested interests, powerful interest groups, as well as economic, political and social issues and their complex interactions o n different policy levels that all affect access to and provision of resources (see Chowdary, 1995; Kanji et a l., 1992 for more detail). A large factor was pharmaceutical industry (biomedica l) protection of patent and IPR rights (secondary resources) which was played out in forums such as the W TO, and the economics of drug development and supply.81 The WHO commented in relation to the stark statistics on access to essential drugs: \u0093[t]he reasons [for t his] are well known and include 81 The industry did not have incentives to develop dr ugs for which there was \u0093great need but from which one can derive little profit\u0094 (Bello, 2004). In 2001, after pressure from the South, the WTO declared that publi c health concerns overrode IPR - but this battle is far from w on. A lot is at stake, not only in terms of lives, b ut in terms of profits (secondary resources) \u0096 the pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable one in the US and g rowing (Angell, 2005). Biomedical industries have become on e of the most important areas of competition in adv anced capitalism. \u0093Technological innovation, once offered as a weapon against disease, is now an economic we apon in the struggles between capitalist states\u0094 (Moran & A lexander, 1997:594). For a detailed discussion of TR IPS and essential drugs see Mecurio (2004). 190inadequate financing and poor health care delivery\u0094 (WHO, 2002e:25). Impr oving access to essential drugs was included as one aspect of the Millennium Devel opment Goals in 2000, which can be seen as an acknowledgement of market failure in the equitable provision and distribution of pharmaceuticals. Once the TRM Programme was absorbed within the Department of Es sential Drugs, there was a subtle change of tone and direction of publications, perhaps most clearly reflected in the medicinal plant monograph series. Those on China (WHO, 1989a) and Vie tnam (WHO, 1990a) were to impart ancient and valid information about herbal medicines and medicinal plants as alternatives to biomedicine.82 In contrast, the monographs on the Republic of Korea (WHO, 1998c) and South Pacific (WHO, 1998d) were produced after the Prog ramme was incorporated within Drugs Policy and Management, and were dire cted to the specialist scientific community (ethnobotanists, phytochemists and pharma cologists) to disseminate data on clinical uses of plants.83 In the latter case, the plants were potential sources of biomedical compounds and not alternatives to them. The clinical, pharmacological expertise of the Drugs Policy and Management Division was perfectly suited to the growing need to oversee the international s tandardisation and regulation of herbal remedies for mass production. This need to as sess and monitor the production and use of herbal remedies resulted in publications incl uding Guidelines for the assessment of herbal medicines (WHO, 1991a, 1996d), Research guidelines for evaluating the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines (WHO, 1993a), Good Manufacturing Practices: Supplementary guidelines for the Manufacture of Herbal Medicinal Products (WHO, 1996c); Quality Control Methods for Medicinal Plant Materials (WHO, 1998e); Basic tests for drugs: pharmaceutical substances, medicinal plant materials and dosage forms (WHO, 1998a); Guidelines for the Appropriate Use of Herbal Medicines (WHO, 1998b) and General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medici ne (WHO, 2000b). These documents all attempted to standardise and promo te common procedures, terms and methodologies for research and evaluation in order to facilitate production and regulation, which was a pre-requisite for globa l trade. In these publications and activities, the development and promotion of low-cost alternati ve drugs for use in PHC seemed marginal. 82 \u0093[T]o communicate knowledge about herbal medicine that has accumulated over thousands of years, has bee n confirmed through both empirical experience and scie ntific evaluation, and yet has rarely been publishe d ... The book also responds to increasing respect for the val ue of medicinal plants as a source of efficacious and inexpensive new drugs that offer an important alter native to chemically synthesized medicines .\u0094 83 \u0093Addressed to ethnobotanists, phytochemists, and ph armacologists to document traditional clinical us es and bring these to the attention of the international s cientific community, while also preserving knowledge about distinctive indigenous practices.\u0094 1915.3.2:3c) Primary Health Care In the 1990s, the PHC concept had not been implemented as envisaged i n 1978 at Alma Ata, and contributing factors for this policy demise were being analy sed (see Macdonald, 1992).84 In the 1970s, many expectations had been attached to this promising reo rganisation of health care. It was to be a new way to develop basic services, and alleviat e the suffering of underserved populations in the South. Now, those who had been optimistic ally committed to the concept stood back and bitterly reviewed the lack of progress and t he worsening conditions in the South at the dawn of a new century. Instead of \u0093Health f or All by the Year 2000\u0094, the gaps had only widened. One consequence of globalisation wa s a worsening of socio-economic, political and environmental problems (Dodgson, Lee , & Drager, 2002:8), and the increasing disparities in wealth distribution within an d between countries had a regressive impact on global public health (Werner & Sanders, 1997:108). T he HFA goal seemed even less probable by the mid-1990s than it had in 1978 (Bergst rom & Mocumbi, 1996). Around that time, the WHO seemed to abandon both PHC and HFA a s achievable objectives. HFA by the Year 2000 subtly transformed into a vague \u0093Hea lth for All in the 21st Century\u0094, considered an abstract, longer term ideal, and the or iginal notional deadline for this goal passed without comment. In 2000, \u0093New Universalism\u0094 be came the new mantra, and PHC was condemned: Despite its many virtues it gave too little attention to pe ople\u0092s demand for health care, and instead concentrated almost exclusively on their perceiv ed needs. Systems have foundered when these two concepts did not match, because then the su pply of services offered could not possibly align with both (WHO, 2000f:overview). While the WHO appeared to overlook any critical assessment or obje ctive evaluation of the PHC failure (apart from determining it was a mismatch between supply an d demand), others were more vocal in their criticism and in identifying culpab ility. Werner (1995) considered three main reasons were responsible for \u0093sabotaging\u0094 the PHC poli cy concept \u0096 selective primary health care, structural adjustment programmes as impos ed by the World Bank, and the paradigm of health introduced by the World Bank in 1993 when it rel eased Investing in Health to guide policy formulation. These inter-related factors were al l corrosive to the very foundations of PHC and acted as counter-forces to both improving living conditions in the South, and providing the necessary fertile political and economi c ground for establishing 84 The failure of the NIEO could be considered a majo r factor, as the PHC movement itself was premised o n this (economic redistribution between North-South) and i t had also failed. 192comprehensive, basic health care. While the concept was viable ( as practically demonstrated in some countries), the neo-liberal international context wa s not favourable: Community-based interventions that demonstrate the need for an integrated approach to health appear to offer great promise. Such programs require close coll aboration across health, economic and social sectors and broad population partici pation and education. Such \u0091development-focussed\u0092 and fine-tuned interventio ns are less predictable, more laborious, and do not lend themselves to the development of commercial products [secondary resources]. As a result, they are less likely to be promoted in this global environment (Zielinski Gutierrez & Kendall, 2000:86). With PHC taking a lower profile, the specific focus of using TRM as initially proposed was reduced. Instead, TRM became almost exclusively viewed as a raw material for the creation of biomedical drugs, and not as an intrinsically valid health car e system in its own right (Bodeker, 1994b:11). The trend to view TRM as a source for biomedical pharma ceuticals overlooked the development and promotion of TRM as low-cost health care alternative for communities in the South (its original constituency and the ini tial objective), but instead used TRM knowledge to meet the growing demand for new drugs in the North f or conditions such as heart disease and cancer (Bodeker, 1994b:11). Obesity, depression , arthritis, dementia and a host of other conditions related to changing lifestyle, demographics and morbidity and mortality patterns in the North could be added to this li st. \u0093There has been no attempt in addressing the [PHC] needs of the populations in the area s from which the plants come\u0094 (Bodeker, 1994b:11). Millions of dollars were instead being spent on identifying, isolatin g, clinically testing and then marketing new drugs in the North, rather than addressing the cond itions that were still decimating populations in the South. Economic incentives (secondary resour ces) for the pharmaceutical industry were skewing research and development from the use of TRM in PHC, towards production of profitable drugs for markets in industrial ised countries. A few examples can illustrate this trend. A medicinal plant from Madaga scar (rosy periwinkle plant) was used to develop two drugs to treat cancer ( vincristine and vinblastine ), sales of which quickly exceeded US$100 million (Barsh, 1997:28). In Nigeria, T RM ethnobotanical knowledge was used in the development of a drug for sickle-cell anaemia (Raufu, 2003). Similarly, millions of dollars were invested developing a s ynthetic anti-obesity drug from a compound found in a cactus ( hoodia gordonii ). This South African plant was used by indigenous San peoples as a natural and powerful appetite suppressant an d thirst quencher. While they now live in poverty, the Pfizer pharmaceutical company can expect very handsome returns when the product reaches the market in the North in 2007. The traditional custodians were described as \u0093a sad, impoverished and displaced tr ibe, still unaware they are 193sitting on top of a goldmine\u0094 who \u0093smoke large quantities of marijuan a, suffer from alcoholism, and have neither possessions nor any sense of the value of money\u0094. Meanwhile the lawyer trying to negotiate royalties on their behalf envisaged \u0093Hood ia cafes\u0094 in London and New York, serving hoodia sliced like cucumber salad to overweigh t and wealthy patrons keen to sample the exotic (Mangold, 2003).85 This is not an isolated or unusual case. An Indian community (the Kani f rom Kerala) used the Arogyapacha plant ( rejuvenating properties. Scientists who \u0093stumbled upon\u0094 this developed a drug claimed to have immune enhanci ng and anti-fatigue properties. In 1995, this formula was sold to a company which was then inundated with orders from around the world. International drug companies also show ed commercial interest, the business potential of which was compared to K orea\u0092s ginseng. Despite the Kani\u0092s \u0093good fortune\u0094, government bureaucracy prevented any money being tra nsferred to the community for over two years. More drugs including a herbal sp orts medicine (Kumar, 1999), tea for osteoporosis, and cough syrup with anti-oxidant proper ties (Nandakumar, 2004) are now being developed from their knowledge. The Indian domestic pharmaceutica l industry keenly monitored international markets and soon began ex porting other products based on TRM knowledge including a brain tonic and a herbal remedy for e rectile dysfunction (Kumar, 2000a; see also Sofowora, 1996:369-370 for African e xamples). Foreigners come down here, they do research. We tell them this plant [primary resource] is for this, this plant is for that. Then they go and make an anti-cancer drug, an HIV drug and what will we get? Nothing. No money, no credit, no thanks [s econdary resources]. Nothing. (Wayland, 2003) The biomedical pharmaceutical coalition had recognised that TRM primary resources would enable them to gain access to more secondary resources (status, economic benefits), which is required to motivate the adoption of primary resources from a com peting medical system (Unschuld, 1976b:8). While markets in the South were huge and demand fo r drugs at PHC level high, returns for developing and distributing medications for commu nicable diseases were low. As the economics of pharmaceutical supply and demand (secondary resources) continued to drive private sector production efforts, some nationa l Governments persisted 85 That they had been able to enter into negotiations for royalties at all was very fortunate. The pharmace utical company had strongly denied their existence and insist ed the nomadic peoples had \u0093died out\u0094. About 100,000 San still populate regions of Angola, South Africa, Bot swana, and Namibia and after proving their existenc e, secured legal representation. \u0093The San thought nobody was i nterested in them. Now Hoodia gordonii cactus has come along. They are excited and have even become a bit se cretive about their use of plants that could chan ge now that there is this mass market of the developed worl d wanting to use their discovery for body [enhancemen t]. What struck them was that anybody would want to use such medicines to lose weight \u0094 These media reports from the National Geographic, Guardian, BBC and Times are us ed as a sales pitch on a United Kingdom website sell ing the diet pills, which promised that coming soon would be hoodia tea, hoodia fruit juices and hoodia snack b ars: http://www.hoodiadietp ills.org/ 194with the ideal of using TRM in a form of PHC. For example, the L aotian Government produced Medicines in Your Garden and in Thailand the Ministry of Health published a Manual of Medical Plants for Primary Health Care. The Philippines, Vietnam and Guatemala also undertook government sponsored promotion of medicinal plan ts. In India 10 TRM remedies were approved in 2000 for use in a family welfare program me partly funded by the World Bank. These remedies were to treat conditions associat ed with pregnancy and post-partum care such as anaemia, pain, nutritional childhood diarrhoea (Bodeker, Although the PHC concept was presenting challenges in implementati on, the WHO had not totally abandoned the idea of using TRM in PHC in the early 1990s. It contin ued to promote the concept by publishing two guides on using practitioners as PHC worker s in the mid- 1990s: Guidelines for Training Traditional Health Practitioners in Primary Heal th Care (WHO, 1995a) and Traditional Practitioners as Primary Health Care Workers (WHO, 1995b). These reports were part of a contracted research project, with the latter consisting of case studies (Ghana, Mexico, Bangladesh) which had informed the development of the guidelines. The guidelines also drew on an unpublished document review ing traditional healers and community health (WHO, 1991d). It consisted of clear step -by-step procedures for planning, training and evaluating TRM practitioners in PHC progra mmes. However, as little implementation of PHC seemed to be occurring on national levels , the practical use of such guides was debatable and they appeared long overdue. According to Unschuld\u0092s theory of contested resources (1975; 1976b), w ithout any secondary resources, it would be very difficult to recruit and ma intain TRM practitioners as PHC workers. In Unschuld\u0092s perspective, social and economic benefi ts (secondary resources) are necessary to encourage the adoption of a differen t primary resource base (such as activities related to PHC). The guidelines recognised this w ith the suggestion to offer some form of remuneration or reward (WHO, 1995a:11). It was acknowledged th at there was often a lack of payment for undertaking extra PHC duties, and theref ore minimal incentives for participation. It was suggested that communities could make a payment-in-kind (such as food, labour, or building a clinic) and agencies could assist the TRM practitioner trained as a PHC worker with establishing income generating activities (e.g. be e-keeping) (WHO, 1995a:11). The case-study report was prefaced with the reasons for the review , mentioning the by now monotonously familiar argument that the WHO had promoted the use of TRM from the 1970s and without mobilising all resources for health care, HFA co uld not be achieved. It 195also noted that over the past decade \u0093the gulf of misunderstanding betw een modern and traditional practitioners has begun to narrow. A growing realizat ion has developed that it is possible for traditional and modern medicine to work hand in ha nd\u0094 (WHO, 1995b:3). The introduction perhaps inadvertently revealed the extent of mistr ust, antipathy and long delay in formalising the role of TRM, considering it had been nearly two dec ades since the original WHO recognition of TRM: There has been a broad gap between the need of the family for prevention and intervention, and the view of many Western health practitioners who beli eve healers are charlatans and profiteers preying on the superstitions of local families . Now because of ... worldwide health problems combined with shrinking resources, the importa nce of the traditional healer is undergoing a gradual re-evaluation (WHO, 1995b:4). The review of activities asked some very pertinent questions inclu ding whether the differences between TRM and biomedicine were surmountable, and if t he two groups of practitioners were able to collaborate effectively to provide a sus tainable health care system (WHO, 1995b:4). However, the comprehensive global overview of programmes and the case studies did not directly address such issues. Despite the hundre ds of documents reviewed, very few evaluations of programmes involving TRM practitioners were ac tually located (WHO, 1995b:39). Overall, it was concluded that involving TRM practitioners in PHC prog rammes produced positive outcomes and was cost-effective (WHO, 1995b:40-43). Constraint s to national level implementation included those mentioned in the previous chapter \u0096 a lack of policy guidance and government commitment, lack of dialogue and co-operation be tween the two groups of practitioners, conflict between practices and paradigms of heal th, poorly defined roles, lack of organised representative groups for TRM practitioners, and l ittle practical evaluation of existing programmes (WHO, 1995b:43-45). As the emphasis on PHC diminished within the organisation througho ut the remainder of the decade, so did further specific activity on PHC and TRM at headquarte rs. The TRM Strategy 2002-2005 (WHO, 2002e) only mentioned PHC in terms of priorities and activiti es in some regional areas, and no reference was made to PHC in the objective s and components of the TRM strategy (WHO, 2002e:45). This is logical considering that strengthening PHC had ceased to exist as a distinct organisational objective in 2000 an d \u0093new universalism\u0094 was now the new directive for health systems development. The main em phasis on using TRM in the 1970s to improve health service delivery (specifically PHC, HFA and also TBAs) had disappeared by the turn of the century. 196Other factors and problem s were behind the propulsion of TRM back onto the policy agenda in 2002. While the tone and content of the TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) was very different from the technical report on TRM in 1978 (WHO, 1978b), they ultimately share d core underlying principles, as the analysis in the next chapter (chapter 6) demonstrates. Concurrent with the escalating WHO activities prompted by commerc ialisation of the TRM/CAM field, the World Bank was addressing economic and corpor ate interests in the TRM arena. 5.4 World Bank activities As mentioned, the influential World Bank World Development Repo rt Investing in Health (1993) signalled a significant shift in global health policy development , and had a major impact on policy formulation and programme implementation. The polic y context became dominated by neo-liberal economic tenets, which filtered through to the health field. Combined with increasing loans for health projects, the 1990s marked a turning point where the World Bank began to overshadow the WHO in guiding and influencing debate and activity in the health policy arena (Abbasi, 1999a; Buse, 1994; Buse & Wal t, 2000; by Abassi (1999a; 1999b; 1999c; 1999d; 1999e; 1999f) examines in detail the changing international role of the World Bank in relation to health. Between 1995- 1996 health lending doubled from $1160 million to $2350 million (11% of total bank lending) and the World Bank eclipsed the WHO in terms of resource al location (Abbasi, 1999a:868). While the World Bank, as previously mentioned, had set the tone for health policy with the 1993 Development Report \u0093 Investing in Health \u0094 it now also became the major funding body and determined the parameters and principles of heal th system development (often directly through conditions attached to loans ). However, some were critical of World Bank activities in the he alth sphere (Ramprasad, 1994:134-135) and argued that debt servicing requirements and structural a djustment programs were countering efforts to improving the health status of populations in the South (Bello, 1994; Rich, 1994; Werner, 1995, 1998). The values and objectives of Investing in Health were also criticised, with some contending that the World Bank was exceeding its mandate as a development and lending institution and promoting \u0093a ma rket-friendly version of Selective Primary Health Care, supplemented by privatization o f medical services and user financed cost recovery\u0094 (Werner & Sanders, 1997:107). 197 The World Bank explicitly entered the TRM policy domain in the 1990s, linke d to their recognition that indigenous knowledge systems can be utilised in development efforts (see for example World Bank, 1998). This attitude marked a new direction in development theory, one that considered education, knowledge and health (investmen t in \u0093human capital\u0094) the keys to future sustainable social and economic development. Thes e sentiments were expressed in the 1998/99 Development Report Knowledge for Development , and the launching of the Indigenous Knowledge for Development Program in the same yea r. Wolfensohn, the then President of the Bank clarified this p osition in his statement: \u0093We need to learn from local communities to enrich the development proces s\u0094 (in Gorjestani, 2000:1). The first World Bank publication specifically related to TRM was Traditional Medicine in Sub-Saharan Africa: Its importance and Potential Policy Options (DeJong, 1991). This document has a more overt political and economic overtone than the WHO publica tions, of which it made little reference. Out of over 60 references, only a few of these were WHO documents, which may have indicated a lack of familiarity with t he WHO policy history in the field and poor co-ordination or dialogue between the two ag encies. TRM was a \u0093valuable resource\u0094 which \u0093should be incorporated into a country\u0092s he alth care system\u0094 and there were various policy options to do so. Paralleling options reminiscent of th ose raised by Dunlop (1975), the first was to simply leave TRM in the informal sector altho ugh that would \u0093not take full advantage of the positive contributions [TRM] can make\u0094 a nd would not allow regulation and control of their activities \u0093in the interests of their patients\u0094. More \u0093active\u0094 options included encouraging professionalisation through lice nsing, professional associations and providing them with access to drugs and \u0093better techniques\u0094 (im plicitly, biomedical primary resources) (DeJong, 1991:i). The most compatible areas identified for co-operation we re with TBAs, to treat psycho- somatic and psychological conditions, counselling those with termin al illnesses, or as community health workers (providing primary health care). It is ironic that Traditional Medicine in Sub-Saharan Africa: Its importance and Potential Policy Options (1991) could have easily been dated as a product of the 1970\u0092s \u0096 which is indicative o f the lack of policy development and programme implementation that had taken place in the meantime. However, it provides a comprehensive overview of the policy issue, which realistically assesses the obstacles and complexities of the matter. It c oncludes that professional competition between the groups is likely to intensify (especial ly if traditional medical practitioners adopt the primary resources of biomedicine) and that pol icies to address this conflict would need to be developed (DeJong, 1991:15). 198 In the mid 1990s, the reports on TRM became more overtly economically a nd environmentally orientated. This focus correlated with inter national trends. Medicinal Plants: An Expanding Role in Development (Srivastava, Lambert, & Vietmeyer, 1996) and Medicinal Plants: Resc uing a Global Heritage (Lambert, Srivastava, & Vietmeyer, 1997) reflected this new development and conservation focus. The former report acknowledged that to date, medicinal plants were \u0093hardly a priority in the Worl d Bank\u0094 and found only six references in the World Bank Lending Operations Database and Report Bibliography Service to medicinal plants or traditional medicine between the period 1979 a nd 1996 (Srivastava, Lambert, & Vietmeyer, 1996:9). However, it recommended that a strate gy on medicinal plants should be developed because they were likely to continue to i ncrease in importance in both industrialised and developing countries as \u0093rising popula tion growth and falling economic levels will probably make [them] more important than t oday\u0094 (Srivastava, Lambert, & Vietmeyer, 1996:11). The latter report had a more explicit commercial tone. For examp le, in noting that many medicinal plants were in danger of extinction from over harvesting it concluded that \u0093Nonetheless, what looks like a problem actually provides numerous oppo rtunities for developing nations to advance rural well-being. After all, medici nal plants are one of the few (legal) developing-country natural products that sell at premiu m prices\u0094 (Lambert, Srivastava, & Vietmeyer, 1997:v). This document provides one of the most thorough and concise overviews of the medicinal plant field, from both a r egulatory and commercial perspective. In contrast to WHO documents, the World Bank assess ments contained solid market data, politically astute observations, historical and s ocial contexts, and information on the current relevant activity of a range of bodies and various nati onal governments. By the mid-late 1990s, it was clear that medicinal plants and conse quently TRM had secured a firm place in the international policy agenda. Its position at the confluence of environmental, conservation, development, health and indigenous knowledge is sues resulted in TRM being afforded a prominent place in many debates and activi ties across a broad spectrum of organisations. It was no longer relegated to being a quaint a nachronism in the health field, but suddenly became a commercial force that took the centre stage of several prominent contemporary policy imperatives. The World Bank activity was an effective gauge of this new found re spect for TRM. While only a handful of references to TRM had been made prior to 1996, in the lat ter half of that decade the World Bank produced several reports on the issue, established ind igenous 199knowledge research centres and supervised projects (as an implementing body of the Global Environment Facility) for the conservation and commercial culti vation of medicinal plants.86 TRM now had economic clout, and this new found status significantly increased its political leverage in the policy domain. Section 3: Activity at national levels 5.5 Debate and activity in the policy stream Activity by policy communities (such as academics and stakeholders) accelerated in the mid- late 1990s, with much commentary on the role of TRM/CAM and techniq ues to evaluate and formalise it in health care systems. Many of the same questions a sked in the 1970s were being asked again in the 1990s \u0096 What does integration and PHC mean? (Bish aw, 1991). How is this achieved? (Bruce, 2002; Hesketh & Zhu, 1997). Does it represent a f easible solution to biomedical delivery and supply failures? (Freeman & Mots ei, 1992). How are various medical systems classified and evaluated? (Cassidy , 2002; Tataryn, 2002). How does medical pluralism operate in practise? (Gilbert, 2004; Haram, 1991; H adopt? (Bodeker, 2001b; Brekke, 1996; Leckridge, 2004). How are conceptual gulfs bridged and a common language developed to enable co-operation? (Anderson, 1999; Bauer, 1998; Christie, 1991; Vora & Tokar, 1999). Lock felt such discussion was simply a \u0093red herring\u0094 \u0096 as it side- stepped the more important issues of social and economic origins of illness es, a fact Elling had already noted when he concluded that the actual mixing of biomedicine and TRM or tec hnical nature of their policy relationship was less important to the health status o f communities than the distribution of resources across that society (Elling, 1981a). Pove rty and inequality in access to social services such as education, housing, water and basic h ealth care would always create poor health status regardless of the nature of health ca re service structure (issues addressed by WHO in the context of \"social determinants of health\", see for example Wilkinson & Marmot, 1999; 2003). 86 The Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded at lea st 8 projects on the conservation and sustainable development of medicinal plants Sri Lanka, India, Et hiopia, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Jordan and the Caribb ean. 200Van der Geest (1997) notes that by the 1990s, there was \u0093a library of publicat ions advocating or rejecting the idea of integrating traditional and biomedical ser vices\u0094 but that \u0093amazingly, the question of whether local communities favour [this] has hardl y been raised, let alone investigated\u0094 (1997:904). He suggested that a community perspective wa s required in the debate \u0096 the only question that needed to be asked was what the commu nity would gain from any integration process. Van der Geest argued that such a process provided f ew tangible benefits to the community (they would be indifferent to integration) as basic health care would not improve anyway. Improving basic heath care was thus the crux of the problem, and not integration as such. The actual implementation of integration to date was considered to be ba sed on a \u0093donor- deficit model\u0094 (Airhihenbuwa, 1995:57), where the guiding belief is one th at TRM practitioners are \u0093deficit\u0094 in knowledge and can be modernised by having biomedical practitioners train them. In the process however, biomedical practitione rs find out what TRM practitioners know (their primary resources) and apply (or absorb) it into biomedical practice. The fundamental assumption is that TRM practitioners nee d training and can make no reciprocal contribution to biomedical skills. seldom has the traditional healer been viewed as a heal th provider with adequate or superior knowledge in certain aspects of health care that w ill be of benefit to the [biomedical doctor] The sources of the traditional healers\u0092 conco ctions and pharmacopoeia, however, are eagerly, even exploitatively Instead of recei ving proper and due recogn ition for the areas in which they are known to be efficient and effecti ve, healers are encouraged to surrender their herbal lore for the advancement of science (Ai rhihenbuwa, 1995:57). Chaudhury (1992:80) argued that national governments should focus on develo ping an infrastructure for research on medicinal plants, and that in t he field of primary health care governments allow TRM practitioners to work outside the formal fram ework of national health services controlled by biomedical practitioners. Inste ad, state assistance should involve access to training by their own teachers and specialists, en suring they have a regular and good quality supply of herbal medicines, and giving them recognition f or their service. It is interesting that this report was a WHO publication, as it was not consistent with the general WHO policy position towards integration and reflected cont inued ambivalence about the formalisation of TRM in health care services: This will be much more rewarding than insisting that all m edicines used by them should undergo clinical evaluation for efficacy, that the two systems [biomedicine and TRM] should be integrated and that the traditional medical practition ers be brought within the existing framework of national health services (Chaudhury, 1992:81). 2015.5.1 National level implementation While countries in the South continued to struggle with inter pretation of WHO directives, very few managed to achieve actual implementation of integratin g TRM into formal health care structures (Pigg, 1995:52) (see appendix 7; page 361 for an excerpt of WHO co untry reports, or Islam and Wiltshire (1994) for a discussion of practical a nd conceptual difficulties encountered). However, informal integration in the private sphere had taken place in the North, as consumers embraced TRM/CAM in the health market. Go vernments in the North quickly began to allocate funding to assess CAM. For example, the f unding allocated in the US to research CAM increased from $2 million in 1992 to $68.3 million in 2000 (WHO , 2002a:18). The recognition of TRM/CAM was often explicitly linked to economi c factors: \u0093In 1996, the Australian Minister of Health pointed out that it was very difficult to argue that an industry that generated A$1 billion in turnover and had directly affected 50% o f the population in the past year should not be considered an integral part of Australian health care\u0094 (WHO, 2002c). Informally, the sector was a significant aspect of health care sys tems and the economic value of it was frequently used to give weight to the proposition to for malise its role. In addition, CAM offered potential cost savings to the state through reducing pha rmaceutical bills and reliance on biomedical technology, and promoting preventive measures (E asthope, 1993:299; Jonas & Levin, 1999:11; Sharma, 2000:217). If improvements in people\u0092s heal th and capacities are factored in, the country reaps a financial d ividend about six times the market value of the plant products themselves (Srivastava, Lambert , & Vietmeyer, 1996:4). Reports from various countries in WHO documents reveal that the pr oblems already prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s remained equally pervasive in the 1990s, with intellectual property rights now also joining the fray and driving the policy proc ess. There still existed a lack of mutual understanding between traditional healers and biomed ical practitioners; insufficient communication between governments and healers; a scarcity of \u0093evidence\u0094 based on scientific research (which was considered a pre-requis ite to formalisation); and minimal funds and human resources as well as a lack of measures to p rotect intellectual properties and patents (WHO, 2000a:11). The lack of relevant legislation, political commitment and profe ssional organisation of TRM was a major detriment to formalising the role of TRM in health car e. The weak position of TRM in policy was reflected by the fact that in Africa, if TRM wa s recognised officially at all, it was often in the Ministry of Culture and not Health (Burford et al., 2000:8). The policy 202on integration of TRM appeared to have no traction on national levels in the South \u0096 it remained bogged down in what appeared to be irreconcilable differenc es stemming from conceptual gulfs and practical difficulties, and hindered by a lack o f budgetary appropriations despite statements of support. Often, only around 2-3% of health budgets were allocated to TRM even in countries committed in principle to TRM (e.g. Nepal and Sri Lanka) (Singh & Foran, 2002). When funds were allocated to the trad itional medicine sector in resource-poor countries, resentment was generated in under-fu nded sections of the conventional medical sector (Bodeker, 2001c:55; Bodeker & Kronenberg, 2002). Competition for diminishing state resources worked to divide rathe r than unite the differing medical systems. Meanwhile, the rapid rising use of CAM in the North resulted in state c oncern regarding how to regulate and incorporate such modalities in the existing hea lth services infrastructure and markets. The practice of TRM had expanded beyond its original ethnic boundary (WHO, 2000a:12) which left governments in the North with some particularly difficu lt policy conundrums. The main issues revolved around how to accommodate T RM/CAM in rational- legal frameworks, whilst also mediating various economic and political interests (see Easthope, 1993:296-299). Efficiency and cost benefits needed to be clear ly established for formal inclusion in health services (Bodeker, 2001c:53-60), as well as saf ety and efficacy \u0096 reinforcing both scientific ideology/methodology and economic rationali sm as guiding principles in evaluating and funding research in TRM/CAM. Physicians, insurance plans, medical centres and hospita ls, managed care organisations and government policy makers should base decisions regarding incorpora tion of and payment for alternative medicine therapies on evidence based research and objective cost-effective analysis rather than consumer interest, market demand or co mpetition or political pressures (Fontanarosa & Lundberg, 1998:1618). Around the turn of the century, TRM/CAM had moved firmly into the mai nstream \u0096 these systems of health care were strictly no longer either \u0093alte rnative\u0094 or \u0093complementary\u0094 but more obviously direct competitors to biomedicine for secondary re sources, reflected in media coverage and health insurance schemes. For example, the Journal of the American Medical Association (1998), the Archives of Internal Medicine (1998), American Journal of Public Health (2002), and the British Medical Journal (December 2002) devoted entire issues to it. CAM/TRM were cover stories of Newsweek , Time (January 2003) and Readers Digest (August 2003). By 2004, health insurance companies in the North offered cove rage for a wide range of modalities beyond standard biomedical treatment s, including naturopathy, acupuncture, massage, herbalism, aromatherapy, reflexology , yoga and 203hypnotherapy. Secondary resources were flowing to TRM/CAM regardl ess of the lack of formalisation in national health care systems. 5.5.1:1 State issues in development and adoption of TRM policy State pressures to formalise the roles of TRM/CAM were now widespre ad in both the North and South, but were different in nature. While many of the relevant is sues in the South were mentioned in the last chapter, a new one emerged related to sustain able development of TRM as an export commodity. The rush to now regulate TRM was fuell ed by dual economic and environmental priorities. The rapid commercial growth of the TRM/CAM sphere had serious environmental consequences for the management of biologic al resources in the South. On national levels in the South, global economic forces had a varie ty of impacts (as mentioned). People could not afford essential medicines and there fore used TRM; and economic stringency in health care systems meant that it also beca me more important to find cheap, local alternatives. In addition, the new interest in TRM f rom the North generated revenue and therefore it became a valuable export and source of for eign exchange (Kumar, 2000b; Mhame, 2000; Sofowora, 1996:371). In the South (e.g. India, Nepal), new for eign interest was used to argue for increased funding for TRM, but often to service international demand and not for basic PHC (Janes, 1995; Singh & Foran, 2002). Safety, eff icacy and quality standards were some hurdles to be overcome in this new op portunity of massive export markets for TRM/CAM. A focus on safety, efficacy and qu ality to develop marketable products (while leading to potentially large seconda ry resources) diverts resources away from constructing TRM in PHC programmes on commun ity levels in the South (Bodeker, 1994b). TRM was now a marketable commodity, a tool which could be used t o build export industries and enhance local capacity building (if IPR could be se cured). This potential had been recognised in the late 1980s when herbal medicines and plants were c onsidered an economically exploitable resource for the South, but one that needed sci entific regulation in order to standardise and enhance genetic qualities: The application of modern scientific methods in the cultiva tion, selection, manufacture and clinical trials of herbal medicines is the most appropri ate way to transform traditional trade into modern industrial practice. In this connection, the Japanese and Chinese models could be considered by other countries when developing their own systems. Industrial production would require the adoption of appropriate agro-industrial technol ogy in order to obtain adequate quantities of medicinal plants of standard physical and che mical quality. Thus there 204is a need for the large-scale cultivation of such plants an d to devote attention to their genetic improvement (Akerele, 1988:359). The need to regulate TRM/CAM due to economic, environmental and public health grounds, whilst maintaining the integrity of primary resources and balanci ng competing interests, was a fraught exercise. Around 1990 new regulations on herbal medicine manufa cture were introduced in Germany. This squeezed 85% of small-scale producer s out of the market, with the remaining 15% of producers being partly or wholly owned by multinationa l pharmaceutical companies. Many observers believed such leg islation (imposing high standards on manufacture and production) was a monopolistic techniq ue by the biomedical fraternity to control the market (Anonymous, 2001). The German model was later promoted as a global standard. In a meeting held in India in 1999, health minis ters from the South called on the WHO not to impose the German standard on them (Anonymous, 2001) . Economic imperatives that pushed for the global industrialised, comme rcial development of TRM also fostered the transformation of TRM in new cultural set tings: Whereas the active co-operation of various systems of medic ine is an important goal, a hasty integration will limit us to a \u0093Disneyworld\u0094 version of the se vast and varied medical approaches. That is, we may find ourselves using only some of the form and some of the substance of complex traditional systems of natural medic ine squeezed into easily marketable and saleable forms (Vora & Tokar, 1999). This transformation and reconstruction of imported TRM systems had already began to occur in the North in the 1970s when TCM was first exported (Taylor, 2004) and al so occurred in the South (Hsu, 2002). New and often simplified forms of TRM theorie s and concepts, or mixtures of different TRM traditions in eclectic versions of \u0093n ew\u0094 forms of health care were offered to eager consumers. For example, mixing Ayurveda with a cupuncture (Ros, 1997), and books based on a synthesis of western herbalism and Ayurveda and/ or TCM (Jagtenberg & Evans, 2003:325). Other examples of copyrighted synthesised therap ies are \u0093yogalates\u0094 (a hybrid of yoga and pilates), Maharishi Ayurved (a specific form of meditation blended with Ayurveda), Bikram Y oga (yoga in a room heated to a certain tem perature), Y oga Nidra (yoga with a type of relaxation technique). These inventive adaptations and modifications enabled copyri ght to be obtained, as the new discipline was then not purely \u0093traditional\u0094 but based on \u0093new discoveri es\u0094 or new applications of the TRM knowledge. This caused dismay and consternat ion in some TRM/CAM sectors, who argued these disciplines were in the public doma in and thousands 205of years old.87 Despite ethical concerns, it was a legal application of tradema rk laws and appealed to consumers in the North who constantly sought new health care t echniques and products in a saturated and increasingly competitive health care market. The integrity of the conceptual foundations of TRM/CAM was therefore threatened by cross -cultural export that simplified and extracted only profitable aspects of the health c are modalities for commodification: the economic potential of growing [CAM] markets has mean t that much business and research interest to date has been focused on specific tec hniques and products that can be marketed. On the other hand, the \u0091healthcare industry\u0092 or even ac ademia, have rarely paid attention to conceptual and philosophical principles on w hich the use of those products and techniques are based. This trend is even reflected in gove rnment sponsored research (Eskinazi & Mindes, 2001:22). International research efforts are increasingly driven by industry and other groups seeking to produce products for the growing world market We must k eep in mind that our research should be true to the great healing traditions and be care ful not to tease the pieces apart for sale on the global market in a way that is appealing to vari ous audiences, but compromises the provision of medicine in the complex manner and the hol istic framework in which it is practiced (Kronenberg, 2001:25). Acupuncture clearly illustrates this trend to modify, simplif y, mix and/or ignore fundamental concepts based on economic or political expediency. In contrast to th e Western use of acupuncture, in China it is rarely performed alone but is only one of vari ous simultaneous treatments. Needles used are traditionally made of various metals, usually gold and silver depending on the effect required (Scarpa, 1981:319). This is usually overlooked in the North, where needles are often only stainless steel, it is used as and has bec ome a distinct profession (or an adjunct to biomedicine); and biomedical anatomy and physiology is of ten used along with Western terms, rather than original TCM nomenclature a nd concepts. In the transfer, acupuncture became underpinned by neuro-physiological and biomedical causa l explanations, such as the release of endorphins for pain control (Saks, 1995a:112; Saks, 1995b). The Western understanding of acupuncture is not based on qi (or chi), the traditional understanding of invisible energy (Jonas, 1999:319). Globalisation led to a rationalisation and standardisation of terms and practices as well as primary resourc es, to conform to new and foreign contexts. In the North, Governments made rapid moves to try to ascertain t he extent of CAM use and how to manage it within existing health systems, raising both p ractical and ethical issues (Thorne et al., 2002). In the United States, a new research centre f or alternative medicines (OAM) was established within the National Institutes for Healt h (NIH) in 1992. Its budget 87 See for example http://www.yogaunity.org/ which is a non-profit organisation to fight Bikram Y oga copyright. 206was doubled by 1995 to US$6 million which still represented only a fraction ( 0.05%) of NIH appropriation \u0096 but even this did not go uncontested (Marshall, 1994). This organisation was succeeded in 1999 by the National Center for Complementary and Alter native Medicine (NCCAM). According to Cant and Sharma (2000:436), only certain therap ies received government support \u0096 those that had altered their organisational struc ture and limited their medical claims \u0093thus reducing their competition with approved me dical approaches to health care\u0094 (in Freund, McGuire, & Podhurst, 2003:187). Significantly, both of these bodies were dominated by biomedical prof essionals (Baer, 2002). Despite that, some of the initial research was scorned by the biomedical community for both research methods and scope: hypnosis to speed bone healing, music therapy for brain injury, dance for treating cystic fibrosis, yoga for heroin addiction, prayer for drug abuse (Marshall, 1994:2001). The congress and general public have \u0093consistentl y put pressure\u0094 on the OAM (and later the NCCAM) to fulfil its manda te while the National Institutes for Health \u0093has been reluctant to progress too fast in a f ield it does not consider \u0091scientific\u0092\u0094 (Eskinazi & Mindes, 2001:21). A White House Commission o n CAM policy was also established in 2000. Important aspects of these (and other govern ment sponsored research and inquiries) was the education and training, professio nal regulation and efficacy of primary resources of TRM/CAM (White House Commission on Com plementary and Alternative Medicine Policy, 2001). In 2000 the United Kingdom government assessed CAM, and the House of Lords (Se lect Committee on Science and Technology) produced a controversia l report (Bodeker, 2001a; McIntyre, 2001). The main point of contention was on the use of scientific validity (efficacy) to rank and categorise TRM/CAM, which went beyond the terms of refe rence. The Committee devised three groups to define TRM/CAM, based on fa ctors such as their level of professionalisation, and adherence to or compatibility with biome dical tenets.88 The criteria used for categorising TRM/CAM revealed an underlying assumption about t he superiority of biomedicine. The Committee was explicitly ranking TRM/CAM a ccording to how closely it had assimilated to or was compatible with biomedical ideals. 88 Group 1 was considered professionally organised (a cupuncture, chiropractic, herbalism, homoeopathy, osteopathy); Group 2 was considered supplementary to biomedicine (Alexander technique, counselling, hypnotherapy, shiatsu, reflexology, yoga); while Grou p 3 was considered \u0093indifferent to the scientific p rinciples of biomedicine\u0094 and divided into (a) ancient traditiona l systems (e.g. Ayurveda, TCM) and (b) those lacking a ny credible evidence base (crystal therapy, dowsing, iri dology, radionics). (Note that acupuncture has been separated from TCM and is presented as an independent therapy in group 1) (House of Lords Select Committee on Scien ce and Technology, 2000). 207The Indian government immediately sent a delegation to the United Kingd om to present scientific evidence of the efficacy of Ayurveda, to no av ail. This case was viewed by Bodeker as an extension of hostile colonial attitudes and power plays bet ween biomedicine and TRM that had existed for over 165 years based on \u0093linguistic, cu ltural, and epistemologic [sic] differences between the traditions, leading each side to view that the other has no sound basis in theory or practice\u0094 (Bodeker, 2001a:390). Contested aspects of TRM/CAM now came to a head, as the regulation process establishe d the boundaries of primary resources and therefore, crucially established the acces s to secondary resources (economic benefits, prestige). Regulation required the classification of primary resources and d efining the boundaries of primary resource bases. In regulating TRM primary resources, the question of whether it is it a food, herb, vitamin, drug or weed needs to be objectively asked and a nswered. This is not a clear-cut process, and the categories may not be mutually exclus ive. In Korea, India, Japan and China (amongst other cultures and countries) food has been used for thousands of years for medicinal purposes (Grivetti, 2003). This concept became popular in the Nor th in the 1990s as \u0093functional foods\u0094 and \u0093nutraceuticals\u0094 \u0096 scientifically appr aised common food items from which active compounds are identified and then transf ormed into supplements or commodities (Dow, 2003),89 the global market for which was US$80 billion in 2004 (Nandakumar, 2004). The issue of regulation and classification of primary resources is political as it allocates benefits to particular groups, rather than technical (neutral, with no sectional interests served). This question needed to be addressed in the North (Mill s, 2002; Mitka, 1998) as well as the South (Burford et al., 2000:8). It remained problematic in the South, as there was often no distinction between food and medicine \u0096 food therapy was a c ore component of TRM systems. Different assessments and value judgements res ulted in different classifications. For example: Gingko Biloba, St. John\u0092s Wort, cha momile, guarana, and kava were given different labels such as medicine, supplement or health prod uct depending on location (Pollock, 2000:5). 89 For example, scientists recently discovered that blu eberries lower cholesterol more effectively than bio medical drugs prescribed for that purpose. They believe blue berries may hold the key to fighting obesity and heart disease \u0096 and are currently developing a new product (nutrace utical) from the compound isolated (pterostilbene) ( Anonymous, (1996:325) provides the example of Chromolaena odorata , listed as one of the most serious weeds affecting coconut, rubber and oil palm cultiv ation in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nigeria. However, these crops are amongst the l owest earning commodities while the \u0093weed\u0094 is a medicinal plant used as an antimi crobial to treat burns and wounds. A tube of the herbal medicine costs around US$0.25c, while the imported biomedical equivalent costs between $US5-6. [W]hich is the real cash crop here: coconuts or Chromolaen a? Could it be that some of the world\u0092s worst weeds, if only we looked, might turn out to be so me of the world\u0092s best medicines? (Bodeker, 1996:325) The necessity to define and categorise foods, herbs, plants and drug s was driven mainly by commercial incentives. It was required to enable standardi sation, regulation, commodification, quality control and mass production and distributi on. Globally, it became more urgent to undertake this classification as consumers were buying prod ucts in the unregulated private sphere, or in a public sphere which was lagging in sup ervision capacities. In the 1990s there was a sudden imperative to regulate the trade of fo ods, plants and herbs associated with burgeoning domestic and international consumer demand. This defining and categorising was also a process of exclusion and restriction of TRM/CAM primary resources (Jagtenberg & Evans, 2003). In China, regulations for \u0093functional foods\u0094 (foods with medicinal value) were introduced in 1996/1997 after which the market expanded rapidly, as production moved fr om small family/local industries to large scale manufacturing en terprises. There are now more than 2000 such enterprises, with a market capacity of US$6.3 billion and over 4000 func tional foods registered with the Ministry of Health. The registration proc ess involves scientific proof of the active ingredients to demonstrate efficacy or healt h functions, and quality control specifications. No therapeutic claims can be made (Jun sheng, 2003). Functional foods are therefore nutritional supplements, not medicines (in cont rast to no such distinction being made in TRM conceptual frameworks). TRM/CAM therefore needed to conform to economic and regulator y frameworks that could not fully comprehend or accommodate its primary resources and under lying principles (e.g. spiritual aspects, the conflation of food/medicine). This also was ev ident in legal jurisdictions (Okoth-Owiro, 1994), which were being presented with di fficulties in interpretation and application of principles in TRM/CAM cases. F or example, in New Zealand a man was charged with driving under the influence of kava, but wa s acquitted as kava had not been registered or recognised as a drug (Pollock, 2000:2). In British Columbia, 209a person sued TRM practitioners who had forced him into a TRM ther apy (\u0093spirit dance\u0094), without his consent but according to traditional practices. The judge agreed that it constituted assault, battery and false imprisonment and awarded damages to the plaintiff (Waldram, 2000:618). These examples illustrate that there is a fine line between de termining or demarcating food/drugs/weeds and healing/hoax (placebo)/assault, that the categorisation is subjective, and allows allocation of different secondary resources to diffe rent recipients. This direct clash of TRM/CAM and biomedicine in legal or regulatory arenas us ually resulted in favour of biomedicine. As Saks presents it, TRM/CAM and biomedicine are two sides of the same coin \u0096 but when tossed it always lands heads up (biomedicine) (Saks, 2003a: 143).90 It is very difficult to apply the same regulations to TRM/CAM as applied to biome dical devices and products, especially those used in traditional practices from ot her cultures (Eskinazi & Mindes, 2001:21), and it was not always easy to understand the logic and w ide variation in approaches (Chaudhury, 1992:73). The structurally weaker TRM/CAM was still perceived as inade quate or unsafe in comparison to biomedicine. There appeared to be a distortion in public and media perception about safety and efficacy of TRM/CAM in comparison to biomedi cine. For example, in Australia panic ensued when an herbal medication caused the hospit alisation of 19 people. It absorbed much media attention, caused the largest product re-cal l in Australian history and crippled the CAM industry, when 219 CAM medicines were pulled from shelves ( costing millions of dollars) (Harris & Gottliebsen, 2003; Tobler, 2003). A few months later, a study was released (cited by Steketee, 2003) w hich found that in Australia, 16.6% of hospital admissions (representing 470 000 patien ts) resulted in an \u0093adverse event\u0094 and caused 18 000 deaths and 50 000 cases of permanent disabi lity annually. It was conservatively estimated that at least 25% (4 500) of the de aths could have been prevented. These statistics compare to 122 deaths from AIDS and 1721 fat al car accidents per year. A health economist was quoted, declaring that biomedical error was the major epidemic of our time, preventable errors cost $4.5bn a year and public know ledge of this would cause a major scandal (Steketee, 2003).91 However, this report went largely unnoticed 90 Saks proposes that this coin may have become more eq ually weighted after the mid-twentieth century with th e resurgence of TRM/CAM, but it could be argued that t his is clearly evident only functionally (at communi ty level) not structurally (in health policies, programmes, resou rce allocation). 91 \u0093If this was known, all hell would break loose I magine the outcry if 1 in 10 customers of restauran ts were poisoned or 13 jumbo jets crashed each with 350 [ passengers] or there were 45 Bali bombings with 100 [people] killed [in each incident]\u0094 (Steketee, due to iatrogenic effects of 210and inspired limited press coverage. Similarly, in the United Kingdom more than a quarter of a million patients were admitted to hospitals annually due to advers e drug reactions (Hitchen, 2006). The seriousness of biomedical iatrogenesis was overl ooked, and iatrogenesis of TRM/CAM exaggerated. Many of the complexities arising from the state regulation, tensi ons between local-global spheres of use, and market imperatives of TRM can be highlighted wit h a detailed example. Appendix 8 (page 362) offers an overview of some of the issues discus sed in this chapter in relation to a particular location, with reference to kava. The positions of interest groups and stakeholders (biomedical and TRM/CAM practitioners) are detailed b elow, in a generalised way. For example, these groups were not always in direct \u0093conflic t\u0094 or \u0093opposition\u0094 to each other \u0096 throughout the 1990s examples of biomedical and TRM practitioners wo rking together and co-operating did occur, usually in mutually benefici al (albeit often unequal) arrangements where both obtained secondary resources (see Sof owora, 1996). Biomedical practitioners sometimes did make patient referrals to CAM, parti cularly for chronic illnesses and conditions biomedicine had proven ineffective in treating (Astin e t al., 1998; Cant & Sharma, 2000:430). However, in general the interest groups are distinct an d are presented as such for clarity. 5.5.1:2 Interest group: Biomedical profession The rising use of TRM/CAM in the 1990s represented a serious threat to the biomedical profession, on two fronts. Firstly, their primary resource base was being challenged with alternatives that were readily embraced by consumers. In addi tion, their secondary resources were being depleted as TRM/CAM practitioners gained more stat us and prestige as well as economic and social benefits from their practice. This decade represe nted a \u0093watershed\u0094 where \u0093it was more in the interests of the [bio]medical professi on to incorporate [TRM]/CAM on its own terms rather than reject it\u0094 (Saks, 2003a:144). Therefore, the biomedical profession strengthened control of the integration process, and responded to this challenge in multiple ways to maintain their st ructural professional dominance and authority. These responses were \u0093based on tion thope, 1993:294). The biomedical profession responded with scepticism about the scienti fic validity of anything biomedicine, and properly delivered biomedical trea tments are the sixth leading cause of death in the W est (Jonas & Levin, 1999:5). 211outside their own boundaries, and attempted incorporation of some of t he techniques (Gabe, Kelleher, & Williams, 1994:xv). Such strategies had been commonly employed by the biomedical profession in the past (Baer, 1981; Fairfoot, 1987; Janes, 2002; Jon as & Levin, 1999; Leslie, 1980; Lock, 1990). Whereas in the 1980s, the dangers and risks associated with CAM/TRM h ad been emphasised by the biomedical profession, in the 1990s the attitude generall y became more positive (Saks, 2003a:144) to enable selective incorporation of CAM/ TRM primary resources. \u0093So after dismissing CAM therapies as quackery for th e better part of a century, the medical establishment now finds itself racing to evaluate them \u0094 (Cowley, Underwood, & Braiker, 2002). This was done under the rubric of \u0093evidence based medicine\u0094 (Gu yatt, Cairns, & Churchill, 1992), where a medicine or therapy had to demonstr ate improved patient outcomes with randomised controlled clinical trials. On ly those treatments that had clearly demonstrated this were to be absorbed within the reperto ire of biomedical primary resources (Dalen, 1998:2180; Harlan, 2000:13, 14). The application of scienti fic discourse thus continued to be used as a filter to exclude or incorpora te TRM/CAM primary resources, and allowed biomedicine to exert control and authority over the legit imation of competing health care discourses. Lewis (2003) analysed how this shifting attitude is reflected in biome dical literature, and found that a rhetoric of danger was constructed about herbal medic ines which served as a tool to legitimate biomedical hegemony. Safety and danger are key conc epts in disputes between medical systems (O'Neill, 1994) as this enables restrict ion over the use of primary resources by potential competitors. Lewis (2003) assessed the Medical Journal of Australia between 1968 and 2002 and found that any acknowledgement of the benefits of herba l medicines did not appear until 1997 and had been totally absent in the 1980s. How ever, by the turn of the century, \u0093efficacy\u0094 rather than \u0093danger\u0094 became the m ore prominent discourse (Lewis, 2003). As already mentioned (and discussed in more detail in the following c hapter on the WHO TRM Strategy ), the safety, efficacy and evidence based medicine agenda all ows more stringent control over economic resources directed to CAM/ TRM research, as the biomedical coalition can control funding and the focus of research through t he expertise and qualifications required to undertake tests. The efficacy agen da absorbs massive amounts of funding while neglecting public health concerns (Bodeker & Kronenberg, 2002), a nd limits the secondary resources channelled to their competitors. Kennedy and O lsson argued that 212\u0093for effective integration to occur both traditional and biomedical approaches to medicine would need to compromise on the use of safe and effective cures\u0094 (1996 :45). While there is much literature on the topic of efficacy that is be yond the scope of this research to discuss, a limited number of observations are relevant and worth making. The dismissal of anything functioning as a placebo can be seen to serve a political purpose by the biomedical coalition: \u0093[it] is an intentional act and part of biomed icine\u0092s quest to identify those aspects of human experience over which it can claim authorit y and therefore assert control\u0094 (Waldram, 2000:617). It also serves to greatly limit what is recognised as the legitimate primary resource base of TRM/CAM. An emphasis on eff icacy is therefore an effective strategy to limit and reject the scope of alternative healing modalities (primary resources), which directly impinges upon the secondary resources (econom ic and social benefits) that can accrue to TRM/CAM. It also overlooks the demonstr ated limited and questionable effectiveness of many biomedical treatments (Da len, 1998; Peabody et al., 1999:127; Smith, 1991), as well as the sheer scope of the task (Chaudhury, 1992:77; Las t, 1986:4). Similarly the differential and disproportionate emphasis on \u0093sa fety\u0094 places biomedicine above the very standards of safety and efficacy that the profession imposes on other groups within the health care sphere, and gives them the authority and power as ga tekeepers to exclude their own competitors from the market. Domination by biomed ical interests was one reason integration was resisted by TRM practitioners in the 1970s \u0096 int egration would mean they would be controlled by competitors whose interest lay in putting them out of business (Kleinman, 1978:84 ). This control could now be expressed in calls for s trict market regulation based on \u0093benign\u0094 and \u0093neutral\u0094 safety and efficacy grou nds, in the patient\u0092s best interests. This easily combined with economic rationalist co ncerns to fund only clearly demonstrated efficacious and cost-effective treatments from the public purse. In the 1980s CAM had been criticised as \u0093unscientific\u0094 by the British Medical Association (Fairfoot, 1987; Saks, 1998:207; Sharma, 2000:214), but in the 1990s the stance was moderated. In 1993, the British Medical Association released a re port on CAM which proposed that biomedical practitioners improve their knowledge of CAM. Howe ver, it also argued for increased professional regulation of the sphere, contin uing biomedical responsibility for the patient, greater biomedical input into courses on CAM and no 213additional research funding (Saks, 1998:211).92 The report stressed the authority of biomedical doctors to assist the community to evaluate the competi ng claims of CAM (Sharma, 2000:215). The new interest in and scrutiny of CAM by the biomedical professi on was reflected in a surge of articles on this field in mainstream medical literat ure (Barnes et al., 1999:938; Barrett et al., 2003). Annual MEDLINE citations of CAM increased progressively from 156 in 1990, to 906 in 1999 (Barrett et al., 2003:938). Barnes et al. conducted a system atic search of medical literature to see if there was a growth of interest by the professional scientific community in areas of alternative medicine, traditional medic ine, acupuncture, homeopathy and chiropractic (Barnes et al., 1999). They found that from 1966 to 1996 t he total number of articles rose significantly to a peak of 400 000 additions per annum in 1996. Th e proportion of clinical trial-type alternative medicine articles was l ow but increased significantly from 1987 to 1996. They suggested that the plateau of new articles reached in 1996 coul d reflect a reduction in the rate of submission to more specialised CAM journa ls or a reluctance of mainstream medical journals to devote more coverage to the issue.93 At the same time, there was a massive increase in the promotion of biome dical primary resources demonstrated by the rising proportion of expenditure in advert ising. Whereas in 1989 the spending on advertising of pharmaceuticals in the US was US$12 mill ion, in 1999 in had jumped to US$13 billion (Jobst, 1999:107). While heavily promoting their own primary resources, the biomedical profession also began to modify professional association rules and paradigms to enable the selective absorption or the exc lusion of CAM/TRM. The biomedical paradigm was modified in two significant ways in the 1990s, the first being with the adoption of \u0093evidence based medicine\u0094 already mentioned. Thi s enabled scientific methods to determine efficacy to become the standard criteri a to assess validity of treatment modalities. Therapies or that did not have an adequate scientific evidence base could thus be dismissed or excluded from \u0093legitimate\u0094 medical practice or formal health care services. The second paradigm shift was in the development of a new school of thought, re flected in new biomedical terminology that became prevalent in the 1990s such as \u0093mind- body medicine\u0094 and integrative or integrated medicine (using biomedicine with selected facets of TRM/CAM such as acupuncture or medicinal plants) (see Anderson, 1999; Ba rrett, 2003; 92 This biomedical professional attitude was also evid ent elsewhere, for example in Australia biomedical practitioners sought to exclude CAM from government funding and criticised it as \u0093unscientific\u0094 (Eastho pe, 1993). 93 Research into TRM/CAM was still a contentious matte r, with some academics discredited or threatened if they associated with CAM practitioners (Eskinazi & Mindes, & Relman, 1999). These new schools of thought developed rapidly, overcoming the mind-body split inherent in the biomedi cal Cartesian conceptual foundations and evolving from Engel\u0092s bio-psycho-social model of health care (Engel, 1977). It was sometimes referred to as psycho-neuro-immunology (the study of mind-body interaction) (Easthope, 1993:295; Macdonald, 2005; Ta taryn, 2002:884), which clinically validated some of the premises of TRM/CAM.94 Historically, the paradigms of traditional knowledge syst ems have been viewed as \u0091primitive\u0092 by modern or Western science, including [bio]medicine. Howe ver, recent advances in environmental sciences, in immunology, medical botany and p harmacognosy have led to a new appreciation of the precise descriptive nature and ef ficacy of the treatments employed (Bodeker, 1994b:6). The modification of biomedical conceptual and professional boundari es to enable selective absorption of TRM/CAM was concurrent with an increase in scient ific validation, and the dropping of professional restrictions against practice or c ollaboration (Saks, 2003a:144). It was recognised by some that such developments, fostering selective incorporation of TRM/CAM into the biomedical sphere, were primarily motivated by ec onomic considerations \u0096 an effort to \u0093expand market share in a com petitive environment\u0094 (Kaptchuk & Miller, 2005:288) and a response to growing demand which provided an opport unity to expand responsibilities and seize profits (Gilbert, 2004). This occu rred in the 1990s (as Unschuld theorised) when it was recognised that using the primary resources of competing medical systems would be advantageous to secure more second ary resources such as economic benefits, status or prestige (Unschuld, 1976b:8). The requir ement for secondary resources to encourage co-operation was expressed in the World Health Forum Journal : Doctors should be rewarded with salary increments for coll aborating with ethnomedical practitioners [economic benefits], who in turn should be re warded for their collaboration with training courses, equipment, certificates and diplo mas [status, prestige] (Bastien, 1994:136). Therefore, biomedicine still demonstrated a reluctance to a ccept aspects of CAM/TRM without economic incentives (secondary resources), but were more re ceptive to accepting 94 Psycho-neuro-immunology (PNI) was \u0093attractive to [biomedical] doctors because it enables them to continue to legitimate occupational closure using a rhetoric of science. That rhetoric is central to their occupat ional claim to monopoly and professional status PNI appears to o ffer the possibility of incorporating the insights of alternative practitioners and social science about the contextua l nature of illness without abandoning the biomedic al scientific model \u0094 (Easthope, 1993:295). 215those treatments or therapies that demonstrated scientific val idity and profitability such as acupuncture (Easthope & Tranter, 2000; Saks, 1992b, 1994, 1995a). For other as pects of TRM/CAM \u0093[t]here is a lack of desire to research complementary a nd alternative therapies because often the therapeutic entity cannot be patented, a nd therefore no commercial profitability exists\u0094 (Giordano et al., 2002:902). There is no commercial incentive to produce drugs that use natural ingredients (Bodeker, 1994b:102; Jobst, 1999:107), unles s patent protection (exclusive access to secondary resources) can be obtaine d from locating, extracting, synthesising and modifying the natural substance. 5.5.1:3 Interest group: TRM/CAM practitioners In the 1990s, TRM/CAM practitioners were simultaneously presented wi th both a threat and an opportunity. Their primary resource base was adopted by consumer s, and this surge of interest necessitated increased public sphere oversight and regula tion. Suddenly, small scale local production was being subsumed by mass production on a global scale and their primary resources were moving into previously foreign markets (Jagte nberg & Evans, 2003). Competition to secure contested resources was expressed in foru ms such as the WTO and TRIPS (patent disputes and ownership claims) and in the biomedical spher e by recourse to demands for scientific validation and safety and efficacy agenda s. By the mid-1990s, a sense of dissatisfaction with the WHO approach to TRM was being articulated, such as the focus on TRM use only in PHC and only on cli nically efficacious remedies. At a meeting in 1996 of TRM practitioners and advocates, \u0093[t]he re was reluctance to accept the apparent WHO restriction of [TRM] to primary health car e\u0094 (Bodeker & Bichan, 1996:393) and TRM practitioners in Africa sought greater inc lusion in state health programmes and called for a global representative council to be formed (editorial, 2002a). In seeking greater secondary resources, they were still keen to s hare the primary resources of biomedicine: The healers did want to come to the hospital and work han d in hand the traditional healers would be very, very happy. Most of them thought they would have power an d the Ministry of Health would pay them [secondary resources] (Upvall 1992:34). During the 1990s, TRM and CAM practitioners realised the economic value of their primary resource base and began to quickly lay claim to ownership. This was mainly visible with tactics of professionalisation and the adoption of scientific disc ourse. While these tactics 216were employed, they were not free of controversy and difficulti es in application and as Lee (1982) argued, they may hasten the absorption of TRM/CAM into the bi omedical sphere. The most obvious activity was in the area of professionalisation . Wahlberg (2006) mentions a number of studies that indicated various forms of TRM and CAM wer e undergoing rapid professionalisation, \u0093involving the creation of practitioner associa tions, registers, ethical codes of conduct and disciplinary committees, not unlike those fou nd in the biomedical profession\u0094 (2006:127). Th e acceleration of professionalisation was evident in Afri ca (Kagwanja, 1997; Last 1986), Europe (Saks, 2003b; Sharma, 1992) , Asia (Kim & Lim, 2003; Wahlberg, 2006), and North America (Baer et al., 1998; Kelner et al., 2004; Welsh et al., 2004). However, the professional development of T RM was hindered in some countries by a lack of legal recognition of TRM practiti oners (Okoth-Owiro, 1994:53). The intensification of professional activity was also reflecte d with an increase in journals, articles, conferences and other publications related to TRM/CAM, a ccreditation of courses and formalisation of training and education. The attitudes of biome dical stakeholders to the professionalisation of CAM in Canada were analysed by Kelner et al. (2004). They noted that several strategies were adopted by the biomedical coaliti on to constrain the professional development and jurisdiction of CAM. These strategies included demanding scientific evidence of safety and efficacy; redefining what integration w as (blocking and controlling the process of integration); and opposing government funding being alloca ted for research. Such strategies were deemed to protect the dominant position of biomed icine and maintain existing \u0093jurisdictional boundaries\u0094 (Kelner et al., 2004), and wer e evident elsewhere, such as the US (Fontanarosa & Lundberg, 1998), UK (Saks, 1998) and Australi a (Easthope, 1993). These findings are consistent with Lee\u0092s assertion that both p rofessionalisation and the use of scientific discourse were key aspects in obtaining or maintaini ng structural dominance (Lee, 1982). Biomedicine can use these techniques to block or control integrati on (structural recognition of TRM/CAM) and TRM/CAM can use them to increase leverage. For example, the use of both scientific discourse and professionalisation was de monstrated by acupuncture. The World Federation of Acupuncture-Moxibustion Societies w as formed in 1987 and boasted nearly 60 000 members \u0096 however, 70% of these members (35 000) were either biomedical doctors or had graduated from an accredited in stitution recognised by national government (WHO, 2002e:40). Secondary resources were obtained by a cupuncture through the use of these techniques but also enabled biomedicine to domi nate/absorb it via 217professional organisations (or the development of them), the tran slation of the knowledge base into biomedical scientific terminology, and adopting it as an adjunct to biomedical practice. While some embraced the concept of professionalising to gain offic ial recognition, others did not want to be included in official health care plans and were sti ll reluctant to rationalise their primary resources (via demonstrating safety and effic acy, accumulating an evidence base and adopting scientific discourse) or professionalisation (regu latory standards and accreditation for training and education, codes of conduct and offici al oversight). For some, this process meant set fees and taxation, meeting state requir ements for lodging official paperwork and so on (Kale, 1995; Young, 1994:67). The inherent dangers of both professionalisation and adoption of biomedical scientific discours e loomed large \u0096 specifically the threat of co-option (losing control over primar y resources) (see Eby 1998, Jagtenberg & Evans 2003). The need to demonstrate efficacy and validity in scientifi c terms in particular presented dilemmas for CAM/TRM (Dalen, 1998; Thorne et al., 2002:128; Wahlberg, 2006) . Apart from lacking the funds or expertise for conducting such clinical rese arch, and the inappropriateness of some of the measures \u0096 this discourse w as foreign, and ceded control and authority to the biomedical fraternity. Some argued that \u0093scie ntific proof\u0094 was a biomedical construct that ignored valuable methods of healing and tr eatment and ignored many TRM/CAM therapeutic techniques: \u0093Perversely, modern medic ine has often acted as if nature could be ignored and the answers to all that ails humanity c ould be found in the laboratory\u0094 (Akerele, 1993:393). Others felt that scientific research was \u0093unne cessary, wasteful and sometimes even harmful\u0094 (Elkadi, 1994:172). The stringent needs for clinical testing and demonstrable effi cacy (and the required funds and expertise to undertake this) were seen by some to be so onerous as t o be impossible to meet, and even beyond what biomedicine itself could demonstrate (D alen, 1998; Janes, 1999:1808).95 For example, many simple herbal remedies have been used over thous ands of years yet may not be able to satisfy the requirements of evidenc e based medicine (Chang, 1999:183). The lengthy and costly processes for clinical testing preve nted the adoption of such herbal remedies despite \u0093proven\u0094 therapeutic effectivenes s based on practical rather than clinical grounds. 95 \u0093It is clear that many of the therapies prescribed by Western-trained (biomedical) physicians are not evidence based as currently defined\u0094 (Dalen, 1998:2130). 218 it is also reasonable to ask what the point of such researc h might be from the perspective of the country of origin. After all Ayurveda is already an offi cial health care system within India. Is research evidence a realistic basis for the forma l acceptance of specific Ayurvedic medicines and therapies when so many thousands of these exi st? Clearly it would be impossible to evaluate them all clinically (Bodeker, 2001a :391). Calls for the testing requirements to be relaxed or modified w ere met with the WHO eventually agreeing that if a traditional medicine is in customa ry use with no reported side effects, a fast-track toxicology regime (testing on two spec ies of animal for a six-week period) with documentation was an adequate basis for star ting Phase III clinical trials. However, many major Northern funding bodies and peer reviewers rejecte d this approach (Burford et al., 2000:11). In the US in 1996, a research centre was esta blished to co-ordinate and facilitate the evidence base of CAM, although it was acknowledged t hat a language bias may exist in the information as much scientific research wa s published in other languages (Ezzo et al., 1998), and a substantial body of research into toxicity and efficacy had already been produced in languages other than English that was being overlooked by t he biomedical and scientific community (Bodeker, 1994b:13-14). While debating or criticising the limits of scientific validation (Gerke & Jacobson, 1996; Waldram, 2000) or lamenting the lack of ab ility of TRM/CAM to develop suitable scientific methods (Godik & Friedman, 1998), the need for scientific validation to meet WHO and state endorsed \u0093safety and efficacy\u0094 agendas was pressing. If T RM/CAM practitioners wished to be formally included in health systems and obtain the economic and professional privileges (secondary resources) of operating fully in the public spher e, then they needed to adopt the necessary discourse and form professional associatio ns for political representation. Despite difficulties presented by the requirements of \u0093evidence bas ed medicine\u0094, a growing body of literature demonstrating clinical efficacy was being es tablished throughout the decade, and CAM increasingly resorted to scientific concepts and m ethods to describe their practices (Cant & Sharma, 2000:434). Policy discourse in this arena is still conducted by appeal s to evidence and causal inference. The success of more \u0091democratic\u0092 therapies, like herbali sm, depends on the successful use of this discourse: those who advocate alternatives to high t echnology medicine have to show they are better at curing sick people (Moran & Alexander, 1997:593). The views on the safety and efficacy agenda were not shared acr oss the entire spectrum of TRM/CAM. Various practitioners and groups had different perspectiv es, with some embracing it readily and others rejecting it outright. For exam ple, the attitudes of three CAM groups were analysed in Canada (Kelner et al., 2002). Chiropracti c, homeopathy and Reiki 219practitioners were questioned on their beliefs and striking differenc es were found. \u0093The chiropractors agreed that it was essential for their group to provid e scientific evidence that their interventions work, are safe and cost-effective. The l eaders of the homeopathic group were divided on these points and the Reiki respondents showed virtually no inter est in undertaking such research\u0094 (Kelner et al., 2002:235). Kelner et al. (2002) concluded that the CAM groups that are more formal ly organized are most likely to recognize the importance of scientific research t o verify their practices and therapies. However, it could also be concluded that this demon strates that both professionalisation and use of scientific discourse are dual m ethods used by TRM/CAM to obtain more political recognition and secure a role in health care s ystems (obtain secondary resources). The adoption of these methods may reflect the outco me of weighing up whether further secondary resources will be obtained from resorting to t hese measures (or whether primary resources will be threatened). TRM/CAM groups that ma y potentially gain secondary resources could be more willing to submit to the need to pro fessionalise and scientifically validate their primary resource base. The vexed problems of scientific validation and determination of s afety and efficacy are explored further in the following chapter, which specifically foc uses on how these and other issues were dealt with in the WHO TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e). How some of these conflicts and issues were played out on national levels is discuss ed below, with reference to South Korea, Mexico, South Africa, and Tibet. The issues of defining primary resource bases and professionalisation are common themes on many national levels . 5.5.1:4 National examples of implemention Korea provides a particularly vivid and interesting example of the resource model in action. TRM ( Hanbang , practiced by hanuisas ) had obtained an independent legal status parallel to biomedicine after many decades of struggle, and maintained a com petitive position in the health system (Kim & Lim, 2003:1999).96 In 1975, some pharmacists began selling herbal remedies (TRM primary resources), and TRM practitioners petitione d the government to restrict this to the TRM profession only. As the market for herbal medicines expanded in the 1980s and 1990s and became more lucrative (increased secondary resourc es), biomedical pharmacists again began to seek access to TRM primary resources th rough seeking rights to 96 In Korea, health insurance is available for TRM, an d TRM practitioners typically earn more (greater sec ondary resources) than biomedical practitioners due to the popularity of Hanbang (Bodeker, 1994b:7). 220prepare and dispense herbs (Cho, 2000a:506). In 1993, this led to the relev ant legislation being amended to allow pharmacists to sell both biomedical a nd herbal preparations, which resulted in massive demonstrations by thousands of hanuisas (Cho, 2000a:506). Following this conflict over the access to Hanbang primary resources, a period of negotiation commenced and a proposal was developed to allow only pharmac ists who had already sold herbal remedies for a year and passed a qualifying ex am to continue. However, when this proposal was incorporated into the legislation, pharma cists rejected the restrictions and called a national strike in which they were joined by biomedic al doctors \u0096 who also protested a new government policy to support Hanbang medicine (Cho, 2000a:506-507). Specifically, biomedical practitioners opposed the creation of a s eparate administrative unit for TRM, funding for a research institute and other measures (i ncreased secondary resources for TRM). This conflict lasted for several years, with Hanbang students particularly militant in resistance and calling a strike for over two years. This perhaps reflected the threat to their future secondary resources (economic benefits, prestige) if biomedical pharmacists succeeded in their bids to claim rights to dispense their pri mary resources (herbal remedies). The main points of contention can be seen to revolve around the de marcation and control of primary and secondary resources: Would the new department of herba l drugs be affiliated with the College of Pharmacy, or the College of Hanbang ? How would examiners for the qualifying pharmacists or hanuisas be selected? What would be the extent of pharmacists\u0092 rights in prescribing and dispensing herbal remedies? (Cho, 2000a:507). The TRM practitioners took China as their model, rejecting claims that Hanbang was unscientific and that pharmacists\u0092 biomedical knowledge was sufficient for dispens ing herbs. The biomedical practitioners followed the Japanese example, asserting the unity of sc ientific knowledge and that Hanbang concepts and theories were obsolete but their herbs may yi eld empirical uses suitable for biomedical exploration (Cho, 2000a:508). Ultimately bot h sides won concessions in securing secondary resources \u0096 pharmacists managed t o maintain their right to prescribe herbs while hanuisas received institutional recognition.97 In Mexico , the potential for integration was explored by anthropologists (Kennedy & Olsson, 1996). They concluded there were significant differences in knowledge bases (primary resources), but still room for active co-operati on. The authors concluded that there were two main obstacles to effective integration: the fir st was the assumption that scientific 97 For more detail on the manoeuvring of biomedical an d TRM practitioners, and political/professional conf lict over reform in the pharmaceutical industry see (Cho, 200 0b; Kwon, 2003). 221knowledge would inevitably replace traditional systems of knowledge \u0096 \u0093whe n one adds the irresistible lure of high technology and the asymmetrical power rel ations common to the First World/Third World encounters, it is easy to understand why s o few (in the South) have rushed to embrace integration.\u0094 The other obstacle was the chasm sep arating TRM/biomedicine in terms of theory and concepts; the former being root ed in the local and the latter claiming universality (1996:42). Kennedy and Olsson (1996) proposed that the systems of knowledge should be viewed as equal, and offered jointly within community clinics. An expe rimental clinic had already been set up in 1988, and was supported enthusiastically by practitioners and pat ients but funding for this project was ceased by the Government (1996:42-43). Integration took place effectively at the consumer level, even if this did not occur in s ervice delivery infrastructure. Sophisticated medical pluralism operated, with people using bo th TRM and biomedicine depending upon health condition (1996:43-44). Kennedy and Olsson claimed that effe ctive integration could take place through mutual referral systems , which was endorsed by the community. They desired the ability to access either TRM or biomed icine at the same health care facility due to convenience. About half of the small sample of bi omedical practitioners favoured this (1996:44-45). In the post-apartheid phase of the early 1990s, South Africa found itself in a similar position to other countries which had undergone decolonisation in the 1970s. The rol e of TRM in formal health care systems was questioned in a similar vein to that in the previous decades elsewhere on the continent (Freeman & Motsei, 1992; Gilbert, 2004; K ale, 1995). TRM practitioners were banned by an Act of Parliament in 1974 which was not repealed until 2004 \u0096 a move greeted with enthusiasm by black parliamentarians (Sidle y, 2004). In the meantime, many thousands of TRM healers practiced privately and ha d formed professional associations. The government found developing a dialogue with TRM pr actitioners difficult, which was also hindered due to rules of biomedical professional a ssociations which precluded co-operation. One official asked at a meeting: How do I distinguish between a [TRM practitioner] who [is trained] and o ne [who is bogus]? They said, \u0091It is easy. You just find out whether he has slau ghtered a goat.\u0092 Now, I am a [bio]medical doctor, and all this tells me is that they wo rk in a completely different sphere, and that we cannot have the same rules for them To integr ate them, and to give them the same status and privileges [secondary resources] as [bio]m edically qualified doctors is just not on but we cannot ignore them, especially if we want to d eal with problems like AIDS and HIV (Kale, 1995). Thus, there were difficulties and tensions in professional recognit ion, and scarce evaluative information to guide the integration process in South Africa. Co mmonly, the neighbouring 222countries of Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Swaziland were dered, with few encouraging 1992; Kale, 1995). Incorporati ng TRM at PHC level would mean that they would have to accept a \u0093secondary rol e\u0094 and a limit their sphere of influence, as well as accepting the \u0093superiority\u0094 of biomedicine, a reduction in status, and probably a reduction in income due to regulation and taxation (Ka le, 1995). The government made no mention of TRM in PHC plans, the dangers of TRM primary res ources were highlighted and only after the \u0093weeding out\u0094 of the \u0093charlatans\u0094 through professional regulation could it be determined if TRM was an \u0093asset or a liabi lity\u0094 in South Africa (Kale, 1995). HIV/AIDS was a significant motivating factor in seeking to re gulate TRM practitioners and one section of the South African 2004 law on TRM practitioners prohibited unregistered healers from claiming cures or relief for cancer or HIV/AIDS. Biomedical doct ors were concerned that patients were being encouraged to try traditional methods, causing delays in the uptake of biomedical treatment (Sidley, 2004). Sidley notes that other mot ives were the desire to standardise and regulate TRM remedies, which was expec ted to meet with \u0093fierce resistance\u0094 and a need to protect consumers from dangerous pr actices such as traditional circumcision (2004). The legislation can therefore be seen as a rea ctive and restrictive move by the government. It still caused some concern in the health insurance business, which is worth around US$7.8 billion annually, as they felt that their funds would be diminished by claims for treatment from TRM healers. The South African government is now identifying healers, categorising them, setting standards and registering the m, which as Sidley notes is by definition a process of exclusion. In Tibet , Janes has extensively studied medical pluralism, globalisati on and the transformation of local healing practices (Janes, 1995; 1999; 2002). Jane s presents a detailed history of TRM in Tibet, but developments in the 1990s are focussed on her e. Health care reforms introduced in China in the mid-late 1980s affected Tibet mainly through financing, structure of and access to biomedical and PHC services (Janes, 1999:1813-1814). The main factory for TRM remedies became an independent fiscal entity a nd was encouraged to gear production to profit, with international and domestic demand placing pressure on production standards as well as supplies. Rural shortages became common by the late 1990s. However, a clinic for foreign tourists was opened in 1993, catering to increas ing international demand for TRM: With the expectation that the Tibetan hospitals and cli nics generate more of their own revenue, these institutions are responding by diverting [primary] resources away from rural areas, where medicine is less profitable [minimal secon dary resources exist] to the urban 223areas Responding to the potential for profit represent ed by this vast [tourist/international] market [they] are rushing to establish clinics and expo rt medicines, all at a cost to health care in Tibet. The better doctors, the more expensive pil ls, are being diverted medicine factories responding to increasing demand are raising pri ces. This results in local shortages (Janes, 1999:1815). Janes also discusses the role of scientific discourse as part of the rationalisation process that began in prior decades. \u0093Scientism\u0094 is considered a powerf ul force in both Tibetan and Chinese societies, and TRM was now subject \u0093via a host of avenues, t o cosmopolitan, scientific principles\u0094 (Janes, 1999:1815). Reconciling these two bodies o f knowledge had the consequences of the theories and concepts of Tibetan medicine being de fined or explained according to modern physiology, and accepting scientific standards f or evaluating efficacy (Janes, 1999:1815). Research efforts also attempted to blend classical theory or texts with modern scientific methods, following the Chinese process. The motive for compiling i nventories and descriptions of TRM medicines was to enable scientific scrutiny . However, Janes concludes that efforts to integrate TRM with biomedicine in Tibet have never b een \u0093systematic or sustained\u0094 and are more \u0093rhetorical and symbolic\u0094 (1999:1816). The need to professionalise to maintain the \u0093integrity\u0094 of TRM whilst also protecting st andards for this from \u0093narrow and competing interests\u0094 is also important in the Tibetan conte xt (Janes, 1999:1817). The conundrums associated with the use of scientific discourse and p rofessionalisation are clearly illustrated in the Tibetan case, in the face of globalisation (dev elopment of global markets and the pressure from economic imperatives). 5.6 Conclusion In the 1990s, the broader context again re-shaped the policy of integra tion of TRM in formal health care systems. As in previous decades, political, soc ial and economic trends filtered through to international and national health policy agendas. Th is influenced the case of TRM in a variety of complex ways and served to push TRM back onto the pol icy agenda and entrench it as a matter of priority. The main global themes a nd problems of the decade were environmental conservation and sustainable development. In developmen t efforts, indigenous knowledge systems came under closer appraisal as offering tec hniques that could be harnessed in establishing sustainable income generation and ex port markets. TRM featured prominently in this new focus, because the use of plants , herbs and other primary resources of TRM systems became a largely unregulated massive international 224market, and medicinal plants offered a lucrative resource as ca sh-crops to meet the rapidly expanding demand for TRM/CAM in the North. This demand presented an envi ronmental concern related to protecting biodiversity. Medicinal plants were in danger of extinction through over-harvesting and environmental degradation, represent ing a serious threat. In implementing measures to protect the environment (such as cultivat ion schemes), medicinal plants also simultaneously offered economic benefits to indigenous com munities. TRM could therefore be fortuitously tied to several high profile and popu lar concepts on the international policy agenda \u0096 efforts to protect biodiversity and p romote conservation, protection and recognition of indigenous knowledge, and sustainable developmen t/local capacity building. This new focus was a marked shift from the emphasis prevalent in the 1970s which had been the development of low cost health care in the form of PHC. While this had been a paramount issue initially promoting TRM on the health policy agenda, in the 1990s environmental and economic factors caused the problem to be reframed. This was reflected in the presentation of TRM as a valuable resource, TRM practitio ners as custodians of indigenous knowledge, and plants as having a quantifiable economic value. The environmental and economic value of TRM (specifically medicinal pl ants) therefore became prominent in policy and programme documents, anchoring TRM firmly to the broader political and economic agenda. To capitalise on market growth, regulatory aspects urgently nee ded to be addressed (for example, standardisation, quality control, industrial production an d cultivation). The WHO facilitated this, by publishing guidelines on use, assessment and ma nufacture (WHO, 1996c, 1996d, 1998b), clinical research (WHO, 1998a, and e fficacy (WHO, 1991a, 1993a, 1998e). The technical, clinical and tightly restricte d focus of these issues suited their new organisational climate. In the 1990s, the WHO was overwhelmed with financial, administrative and political turmoil and experi enced mounting criticism over failures in major policy goals such as HFA and PHC (which TRM had or iginally been aligned with). Under these conditions, the WHO scaled back its commitment to revolutionising health systems development and instead concent rated on narrow, technical issues guided by neo-liberal economic principles such as e ffectiveness and efficiency. As the WHO objectives of HFA and PHC became less relevant on the hea lth policy agenda, the terminology and jargon associated with them gradually disappeare d or became less significant in TRM policy and programme documents. Throughout the 1990s, t he emphasis of the WHO in the TRM arena became one of mostly guiding strictly cli nical and technical 225aspects of production and manufacture of medicinal plants, and standa rdisation of acupuncture, as part of the global health market. This direction in polic y and programme development was expressed by the co-ordinator of the WHO TRM P rogramme (Zhang, 1999; Zhang, 2001:22): With the tremendous expansion of traditional medicine wo rldwide, safety and efficacy , as well as the quality control of herbal remedies and therapies, have become important concerns Various traditional medicine practices have been deve loped in different cultures in different regions without a parallel development of international standards and appropriate methods of evaluation . The challenge now is to ensure that traditional medicine is used properly and to determine how research and evaluation should be ca rried out. WHO will continue to elaborate technical guidelines and support global information exchange (Zhang, 2001:22, emphasis added). While TRM was still obviously a health issue (Zhang, 1999), the econom ic and environmental aspects of TRM/CAM overshadowed it and became centr al policy concerns. These issues are formally beyond the scope of the WHO and ot her international bodies stepped into the breach. The World Bank, World Trade Organisation , United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and World Intellectual Proper ty Organisation were the lead organisations for issues of trade, development, and int ellectual property; and other bodies such as the World Conservation Union and World Wide Fund for Nat ure addressed matters such as conservation and biodiversity.98 The new environmental and economic catalysts also compelled s tate governments and interest groups to act. National level regulation, especially re garding intellectual property (WHO, 2000c), became more important as international conventions did little to protect countries from economic exploitation of medicinal plant resour ces (Bodeker, 2000; Mbeva, 2000) and TRM knowledge was being \u0093appropriated, adapted and patente d by scientists and industry, with little or no compensation [secondary resources] to i ts original custodians\u0094 (WHO, 2002e:25). TRM/CAM and biomedicine professional groups needed to modify their s trategies to cope with the new context. While consolidating their power and protectin g their primary resource base through professionalisation and the use of scientific discourse presented an avenue of control and power for TRM/CAM (such as access to international m arkets and state recognition), it also presented the danger of having to conform to and be co-opted by biomedical interests. Once scientific legitimacy was demonstr ated, the biomedical coalition 98 See (WHO, 2002e39-41) for a list of some of the my riad international bodies, non-governmental organisa tions and professional associations involved in the polic y arena. 226could absorb the primary resources and claim secondary resources that flowed from them (for example, in the case of acupuncture). The progression of the policy on integration of TRM/CAM can be seen a s a rational outcome of interest group interaction, with both exploiting openings in the problem or politics streams . Attaching the policy proposal of integration to emerging problem s took advantage of windows opening in the problem or politics streams . However, existing power relations ultimately influenced their ability to promote or defend their int erests as biomedicine had entrenched structural control of and authority in the formal health c are sphere. Incrementally, biomedical interests consolidated their authority (for example , through applying rhetoric of evidence based medicine, safety and efficacy) and TRM eithe r had to conform to biomedical structural dominance to claim secondary resources or be marginal ised and exploited. In the following chapter, the WHO policy on traditional medicine \u0096 culminating after an approximately 25 year gestation, is analysed. This policy document represents the end point of the policy process from inception in the 1970s to final outcome in 2002. As the foregoing analysis has demonstrated, the history of this policy has been lon g and complex, over an extended timeframe and with many intervening and changing politic al, economic and social forces. Whilst it appeared to atrophy in the 1980s and stagnate in ad vancement, new vigour was brought back to the policy concept during the 1990s. However, the lack of polic y activity in the 1980s now meant that many pressing issues were inade quately resolved and the need to formalise the role of TRM/CAM became urgent. How best to do this, according to the WHO, forms the basis of the TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) (chapter 6). 2276. WHO TRM Strategy 2002-2005 As we enter the new millennium, the promise of the traditional medicine sys tem has n ever had greater potential or a greater burden attached to it. It should not be a competi tion between \u0091scientific\u0092 modern biomedicine and traditional medicine. Bot h have their place, role and value. (Kronenberg, 2001:29) In 2002, the WHO released the Traditional Medicine Strategy 2002-2005 (WHO, 2002e), which defined its role in TRM/CAM and guided member states on formul ation of policy. The articulation of this strategy followed efforts to ascerta in the global regulatory (WHO, 1998f) and legal status (WHO, 2001b) of TRM/CAM, which found wide variati ons in national level legal recognition and regulatory frameworks. The TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) built on discussions held as part of consultations on Methodologies for Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine (WHO, 2000b) and was the result of repeated requests from member states for guidelines and assistance on TRM/CAM poli cy issues (WHO, 2002e:19). The release of the TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) by WHO headquarters was preceded by increasing regional activity on policy and regulatory aspects of TRM . All of these documents explored various conceptual and regulatory challenges in using TR M/CAM in formal health care systems. The Western Pacific Regional Office published Development of National Policy on Traditional Medicine (WHO, 2000a), Traditional and Modern Medicine: Harmonizing the Two Approaches (WHO, 2000d) and Regional Strategy for Traditional Medicine in the Western Pacific (WHO, 2002c), while the WHO Kobe Centre for Health Development published the proceedings of meetings exploring policy , services and utilisation of TRM (WHO, 2000e, 2001a, 2001c). The increasing public demand for TRM/CAM forced a range of issues on the policy agenda. By the turn of the century, social and economic trends had produced a r ange of health policy issues in relation to TRM/CAM that had yet to be adequately addresse d. The failure to reorient health care systems towards an emphasis on PHC, and in corporate TRM as envisioned in the 1970s, resulted in the policy process coming full circl e by 2002. TRM was thrust back under the spotlight from the sheer weight of consumer utilis ation, which had created an unregulated and informal integration in the health ser vices sphere. 228 There had been a convergence in the North and the South of demand for T RM/CAM, for totally different reasons. Those in the North sought alternatives, a s deficiencies in biomedical conceptual foundations and techniques (primary resour ces) led to unsatisfactory therapeutic experiences and outcomes. Meanwhile those in the South continued to patronise TRM due to deficiencies in biomedical primary resource distribut ion and supply. Dimensions of the biomedical system were found wanting in both cases and \u0093the public are voting with their wallets in the industrialized countries and w ith their feet in developing countries\u0094 (Bodeker, 1996:325). [T]he wealthier sectors of Western societies are switching to natural approaches to health care, [but] there is little policy or public awareness that the poorer sectors of the world\u0092s population are turning more and more to [TRM] for entir ely different reasons. The trends converge as a global demand for natural health care as we ll as in the environmental pressures that are associated with the growing demand for medicinal plan ts (Bodeker, 1996:324). The WHO must have been aware of these converging trends and how they f orced the need for attention, reflected in the increasing volume of publications r egarding policy at regional levels. By 2002, it could no longer remain silent at headquarters, espec ially as other international agencies as well as national governments worldwide were taking an interest in TRM/CAM. In what appeared to be a reactive rather than proactive i nitiative (as it had also been with other policy issues, such as tuberculosis (Ogden, Walt, & Lus h, 2003) where other agencies had taken the lead), the global TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) was launched \u0096 revealing some disquieting statistics. For example, over two de cades after its conception, the objective of formalising the role of TRM in healthcare had only be en acted upon in 25 countries. This was only around one-sixth of the replication or t ransfer rate achieved by the essential drugs scheme. The information presented in the TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) could be viewed as an indictment on the lack of guidance, direction and funding provided by the WHO to member states to formulate policy frameworks over the previous decades, desp ite the fact that this was one of the main objectives of the TRM Programme. While the Collab orating Centres had been busy clinically and scientifically investigating TRM medi cinal plants, very little work had been done on legal or regulatory aspects. This trend w as clear in the 1980s when it was noted that not a single Centre had terms of reference related to policy and l egislation (WHO, 1988:10) but was st ill not addressed by the mid- 1990s (WHO, 1996e). 229By the 1990s, the singular focus on scientific and biomedical evaluati on had only become more marked. This distortion in research priorities meant th at when the use of TRM/CAM surged in the 1990s, most countries were unprepared from a regulatory or health systems development aspect, with many still not monitoring even basic aspec ts of TRM/CAM use and scope. For example, the WHO headquarters review of legal status of TRM/CAM took nearly a decade to finish due to insufficient collection of data, an d even then was not complete (WHO, 2001b:ix). The TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) was produced within the Department of Essential Drugs and Medicine Policy, and made no reference to the long policy evol ution of TRM within the organisation. It was presented in a manner that was divorced from an y historical context, perhaps because in doing so the failures (PHC, HFA, TRM policy) and lack of priority accorded to TRM within the WHO may have been revealed. While it was specifically titled a TRM strategy , it made reference to CAM within the body of the report and grouped the m together as one on the global level. TRM/CAM was presented a s a health care \u0093choice\u0094 for the consumer, and TRM/CAM sources of health care that could have their \u0093 potential maximised\u0094 if the objectives of the TRM Strategy were addressed \u0096 echoing the sentiments of \u0093new universalism\u0094. Just as the initial technical report on TRM (WHO, 1978b) and WHO suppor t of integration had attracted criticism (Velimirovic, 1984b, 1990), the release of the policy was not universally welcomed. Some criticised the inference that by endors ing integration, the WHO was encouraging the use of \u0093non-scientific\u0094 systems of health and allowing potential economic gains (secondary resources) to be made without sufficie nt evidence to support health claims.99 99 \u0093Folk beliefs may influence the willingness of peop le to cooperate with licensed practitioners offerin g science- based treatments. It is important for scientificall y oriented caregivers to respect the folk beliefs of their patients, not in order to encourage the preservation of their beli efs, but to build patient-provider relationships ba sed on cooperation. Without showing respectful attitudes, many patients will reject science-based care and re strict themselves to using the charms, spells and rituals in grained in their cultures for invoking the supernat ural In the health marketplace we must require healthcare pro viders and health-product promoters to be accountab le to their customers regarding issues of safety and effectiven ess. We must ensure sellers meet the standards of manufacturing practice and professionalism. Promoter s of treatments with superstitious or implausible r ationales deserve no exclusion from this burden. Whenever a trad itional practice is commercialized through advertisi ng, sales, promotion, or labelling with implicit or expl icit medical claims not backed by objective supporti ve evidence, it is neither complementary nor alternative. It\u0092s quackery .\u0094 (editorial, 2002b) 2306.1 TRM Strategy objectives The TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) objectives bore a striking similarity to the original essential drugs list (WHO, 1977), which was driven by the need to promo te rational use and access. The principle characteristics of essential drugs as defi ned in that report were safety, efficacy, need and affordability (Walt & Harnmeijer, 1992:27). Th e four objectives of the TRM strategy were policy development; safety, efficacy and q uality; access (availability and affordability); and rational use. While these objectives may be fairly clear (although still pro blematic) in relation to rationalising and regulating biomedical pharmaceuticals, i n application to TRM/CAM they present a multitude of anomalies and inherent contradictions. Ma ny of these are related to global-local tensions and conceptual differences between biomedi cine and TRM (Jagtenberg & Evans, 2003). The international movement of TRM and wider transfer led to \u0093problems of interpretation and application\u0094 in interaction with other cul tures and biomedicine (WHO, 2002e:22). These are exposed when the objectives of the TRM strategy are assessed, with the inappropriateness of the underlying biomedical concepts becoming evident. As previously mentioned, the WHO is composed largely of biomedical professio nals, and so can be seen to align with the biomedical coalition in perception and orientatio n. The application of these principles is therefore a natural outcome of the administrative f ocus. The objectives and some of the difficulties they raise are discussed below (6.1.1.pol icy development; 6.1.2. safety, efficacy and quality; 6.1.3. y and affordability); and 6.1.4. rational use). 6.1.1 Policy development The first objective was policy development to enable TRM/CAM to be i ntegrated in national health care systems \u0093as appropriate\u0094, and the WHO defined its ro le as facilitating this (WHO, 2002e:5) most urgently in the South where populations depend upon TRM for health care needs. Apart from the obvious question of why large segments of entire populations still lacked access to basic biomedical health care, the reasons why rela tively few of the member states had developed a policy were not considered, nor were the rea sons why only Communist/Socialist countries had achieved \u0093fully\u0094 integr ated systems commented on. The WHO had been advocating integration for at least twenty-five yea rs, so would have been some insight into the difficulties this concept presented from a pol itical and economic perspective. 231 However, evaluating organisational policy performance or the policy i mplementation issues on national levels did not feature in the TRM Strategy . The tenor and substance of the policy document suggested that integration was conceived as a purely a tec hnical issue, a matter of administration, something to be bureaucratically organised and ac hieved through regulation. The attainment of \u0093integrative\u0094 systems was presented as a na tural evolution, and all countries with an inclusive system (parallel) were ultimatel y expected to achieve this (WHO, 2002e:9). The notion that integrative systems would ultimately evol ve worldwide was expressed in other policy documents \u0096 \u0093Worldwide only four countries h ave integrative systems In the future [countries with inclusive systems] will b e classified as having integrative systems As the exclusive [monopolistic] system is a lmost nonexistent, it will not be mentioned\u0094 (WHO, 2001c:20-22). The information presented reflected the asymmetric power relati onship between biomedicine and TRM in policy and programme development. For example, of 25 Afric an countries, only 16 had a legal framework and 8 a national budget allocation for TRM. Th e WHO was therefore advocating national biomedical collaboration with sys tems of medicine that may not even be legally recognised, and which had negligible funds app ortioned for any of the safety, efficacy or quality \u0093prerequisites\u0094 for this incorpora tion. While advocating policy development appeared straightforward, it disregarded any lesso n drawing from the policy history of integration, cost-burdens of the recommended approach, practical realities based on the economic position of countries in the South, and political position o f TRM/CAM in national health care systems (especially power differential s, and conflict and resistance exhibited between groups of health care professionals). These di fficulties in formulation and obstacles in implementation had become increasingly apparent over the previous two decades (WHO, 1986a:54-66; 1988:31; 1995b:43-45; 1996e; 2000a:11), but the TRM Strategy was presented in a manner divorced from political, historical a nd cultural context. 6.1.2 Safety, efficacy and quality The WHO proposed to promote this objective by developing and promoting a n evidence base, regulatory systems and guidelines. However, once the use of TRM moved beyond its local boundaries and into the international global healt h marketplace; safety, efficacy and quality issues changed fundamentally in nature and necessitated different considerations. These objectives can actually be seen to constrain and prev ent the radical formal reorganisation of TRM/biomedical health care resources that integration may otherwise entail. 232 Many safety concerns emerge from the use of TRM remedies in situations far re moved from their original contexts. For example, for different uses, in conc entrated extracts, produced in larger volumes or using different techniques, and mixed with an inc reasing range of biomedical pharmaceuticals by consumers in the North. For exam ple, Kava ( Piper methysticum ) has been used ceremonially in the Pacific Islands for more than tw o millennia with no recorded adverse impact. When used for stress and anxiety in Europe, it resulted in cases of liver toxicity (Moulds & Malani, 2003). Ma Haung (Ephedra sinica ), used in China as a tea for asthma amongst other conditions, was used in the US in conc entrated forms for weight reduction and to improve athletic performance. Risks from these uses of ephedra included nervous system problems, seizure, stroke and heart at tack (Shekelle et al., 2003). Garlic may lose cholesterol lowering effects if produced in c ertain ways (WHO, 2002e:26), while ginseng and St Johns wort can interact negatively with part icular pharmaceuticals (WHO, 2002e:27). Aside from problems posed by such interactions, industri ally produced herbal medicines may pose new safety risks such as contamination , misidentification and counterfeiting (Wahlberg, 2006:135). In localised contexts and with traditional modes of production a nd consumption (distribution and supply), safety issues are arguably minimal.100 Therefore, while safety is clearly important there appears to be conflicting needs and divergent prior ities at the local and global levels. Safety can also be considered a flexible and value-laden judgemen t. As mentioned previously, the dangers presented by many biomedical primary resources are equally, if not more, serious than those safety concerns presen ted by TRM/CAM primary resources (Bodeker, 1994b; Ernst, 2003:14).101 Therefore, an adequate safety and evidence base for biomedicine is equally important, and is not already clea rly established (Airhihenbuwa, 1995; Dalen, 1998; Last, 1986:4; Peabody et al., 1999:127; Smith, 1991), a s implied by the TRM Strategy . It could be argued that stringent adherence to safety and toxici ty studies retarded the development of the herbal product industry, impeded integratio n and absorbed limited 100 According to Lock (1990), iatrogenesis associated with herbal medicines in Japan only appeared when T RM was appropriated and rationalised by biomedicine, which raises questions as to whether biomedical producti on and distribution systems that have an important role in iatrogenesis. 101 \u0093Even though herbal medicines are not devoid of risk, t hey could still be safer than synthetic drugs. Between 1968 and 1997, the [WHO] collected 8985 reports of adverse events associated with herba l medicines from 55 countries. Although this number may seem impressively high, it amounts to only a tiny fraction of adverse e vents associated with [biomedical] drugs held in the same database At present the relative safety of herbal medicines is undefinable, but many of the existing data indicate that adverse event s, particularly serious ones, occur less often than with prescription drugs.\u0094 (Ernst, 2003) Barsh concludes that clinical studies suggest that a majo rity of remedies used in traditional medicine are effective and requ ire careful preparation to have strong, selective a nd non-toxic impacts (Barsh, 1997:32). 233research funds.102 The Guidelines on the Appropriate Use of Herbal Medicines recognised that safety requirements may be onerous and unnecessary in many ca ses, and that the history of use should be adequate evidence of safety (WHO 1998:56). However, th is moderation of the stance on clinical assessment of safety was not reflected in the TRM Strategy in 2002, and instead it was recommended that scientific research on saf ety and efficacy be stepped up. The lack of adverse effects reported from herbal medicines were r eported as potentially a reflection of poor monitoring rather than indicating that few adver se effects actually exist (2002:24). Efficacy is an extremely tricky area to navigate objectively, and difficulti es associated with the concept of efficacy in relation to TRM/CAM have been mentioned in previous chapters. Medical anthropology has grappled with this for decades, and some of t he problems determining, isolating and measuring efficacy are related to th e cultural and social dimension of healing (Fabrega, 2002; Waldram, 2000). Efficacy may even be compr omised by removing the TRM/CAM system from its localised context and transform ing it into a marketable product, or using modern methods of production. Industrial processing and production to increase volume actuall y changes the nature of the original remedy and totally removes or modifies the patient-healer therapeutic relationship \u0096 which may be a key in the healing process (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:544; Thorne et al., 2002:911). Individual preparation is often considered a significant aspec t of the healer- patient encounter. In Tibetan medicine, consecration of raw mat erials and blessings are seen as essential contributions to the remedy (Gerke & Jacobson, 1996), which is a lso a major feature of African TRM (Koumare, 1983:26). The therapeutic effectiveness of some remedies therefore cannot be reduced to strictly biological terms. For example, secrecy is sometimes considere d a key factor in efficacy \u0096 if the secrecy is compromised, the efficacy or potency of the remed y is deemed to be diminished (Perara, 1985:95; van der Geest, 1997:905). The subtleties of TRM/C AM systems are sacrificed during the commodification process. The sc ientist (positivist) fails to recognise the value of the relationship between patient-healer, healer-herb or herb-place (Jagtenberg & Evans, 2003:327), and these subtleties must be disregar ded to enable larger- scale production and distribution. 102 In terms of Unschuld\u0092s concept of professionalisat ion, the safety and efficacy agenda can be viewed as a strategy to block the professionalisation of TRM/CAM by biomedical coalition, as they were determining wh en it was appropriate or permitted to apply TRM/CAM knowledge a nd techniques. 234The narrow biomedical concept of efficacy is premised on the not ion of a single therapeutic agent that can be identified, and that isolating this molecule verifies clinical validity.103 In contrast, TRM belief systems often use more than one plant, and process them in complicated ways to produce a compound that may differ greatly from that found in each individual plant. Biological catalysts used in herbal remedies ma y have obscure biochemical mechanisms that are difficult to clinically isolate or ident ify (Barsh, 1997:32). The plant or plant parts in their natural form are also considered important, and extracting certain molecules from them may reduce ultimate effectiveness (Bodeker, 1994b:11-12; Scarpa, 1981). Taking the raw forms of herbs may be far more effective than co nsuming a concentrated or processed extract. For example, a study on Ayur vedic medicine in Sri Lanka found herbal drugs brewed in a simple clay pot were more powerful t han the version produced en masse and in a much briefer span of time in a high-tech, stainles s steel machine (Anonymous, 2001). Strength or potency of herbs or plants varies widely between spe cimen (Chang, 1999:185; Chaudhury, 1992) and according to locale, soil, season, time picked an d other factors including the type of vessel the remedy is prepared in, what it is mixed with, temperature and preparation processes (see for example Jagtenberg & Evans, 2003:327). This local knowledge of bioactive fluctuations and interactions has been clinicall y verified (Bannerman, 1982:10; Barsh, 1997:31-32). Biochemical mechanisms may theref ore remain unclear, and the effect of a drug may be influenced by other fact ors such as diet (Barsh, 1997:32). The focus on proof of efficacy removes the potential role of placebos, w hich have been dismissed from a biomedical standpoint as having no legitimate role in health care provision, but which may actually be extremely potent and powerful resources from a practitioner standpoint. Placebo action does not indicate ineffectiveness, on the contrary it is simply a \u0093residual category\u0094 for what scientific discourse cannot explain (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:543). Placebos work, but biomedical doctors and scientists don\u0092t know w hy or how (Moerman, 2002). It remains one of the intriguing areas of mind-body int eraction beyond the realm of scientific measurement. Some pharmaceuticals (bi omedical primary resources) have been found to be no more effective than placebos.104 Many biomedical practitioners (up to two thirds) regularly use placebos although publicly disapproving of th eir use and 94% felt 103 This also has economic imperatives. A single ingre dient that can replicated, synthesised, patented an d mass produced is necessary for commercial purposes (Bodek er, 1994b:11); this requires a synthetic analogue a nd marketing (Kumar, 2000b:7). 104 German doctors admitted that around 40% of drug pre scriptions were unnecessary, ineffective or harmful (Xingzhu, 2003:6) . 235they were generally or occasionally effective. The use of placeb os is not only frequent, but rising and may have a genuine role in patient care (Lichtenberg, 2004). Techniques used to scientifically evaluate efficacy of TRM/CA M may be difficult to apply in practice (Bodeker, with particular difficu lties presented by the randomised controlled trial which is promoted as the standard methodology for evidence based medicine (Easthope, 2003; Thorne et al., 2002). Randomisation, bli nding and the use of placebos in experiments present ethical and practical proble ms, with the philosophical origins of TRM/CAM making them \u0093inappropriate for simple (rand omised controlled trials) testing and, if such trials are conducted, can render the results mean ingless\u0094 (Thorne et al., 2002:910-911). Other criteria for scientific research can also present hurdles. For example, research ethics that require that biomedical treatments be give n to all subjects means that TRM remedies can not be evaluated in isolation, limiting the ab ility to assess the full therapeutic potential of TRM (Bodeker & Kronenberg, 2002). Prevention is the main focus of many forms of TRM/CAM, with die t and nutrition as well as forms of exercise (e.g., yoga, tai chi) and stress reduction use d to promote balanced health and well being. This presents research difficulties as it is a longer -term, methodologically difficult, and usually expensive process \u0096 however, benefits could be subs tantial (Bodeker & Kronenberg, 2002). The ease with which biomedical, curative tr eatments can demonstrate and quantify results in comparison to preventative methods is one reason it obtained preference in health delivery (Foster, 1977:530). The conceptual and phi losophical approaches to maintaining health and preventing disease are a vit al and valuable part of TRM/CAM, and are overlooked when an emphasis is placed on products (Eskinazi & Mindes, 2001:22), or on specific, isolated remedies and their clinical efficacy. A narrow focus on efficacy may lead to \u0093botanical medicine being used in the same manner as conventional drugs, as \u0091magic bullets\u0092 for the treatment of specific medical conditions\u0094 (Eskinazi & Mindes, 2001:22). There is no \u0093singular view notion is \u0093shifting a nd fluid\u0094 (Waldram, 2000:619). In addition to theoretical and methodological difficulties, and costs involved in establishing efficacy, the ultimate objective of only demonstra ting efficacy neglects the social and cultural dimensions of healing. Although these are not able to be clinically demonstrated or verified, they still have an important and valuab le role to play. TRM/CAM is most often used for symptomatic relief in treating chronic dis eases that biomedicine offers no cure for, and provides patient satisfaction comparable to biome dical treatments (Peabody 236et al., 1999:127). Efficacy as the only criteria for determining the validit y of a remedy is therefore problematic, if the social, psychological and cultura l dimension of healing also has a legitimate place. While some local remedies may be [clinically] nonefficac ious, their use constitutes a coping strategy Now deaths from pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and even AIDS are reduced to \u0091outside\u0092 social, economic and political explanations. Although lo cally meaningful remedies have existed, they are simply no longer being provided (Zie linski Gutierrez & Kendall, 2000:95). And finally, quality is also an issue which is value laden and open to interpretation. The unique individual reaction to TRM/CAM treatments, idiosyncratic variation in provision of treatments and the natural variations in plant and herb products all tend to prevent standardised regulation based on particular \u0093quality\u0094 considerat ions. This need to standardise systems based on externally imposed quality standards is again a fraught exercise that serves to enable regulation and mass production (Jagtenberg & Evans , 2003). As Berliner and Salmon explored, the intrinsic nature of TRM/CAM in itself defie s such categorisations: Subjective nature of response to therapy tends to frustra te quality control Since they are purportedly objective, [biomedical] therapies can be stan dardized by their very nature and self-definition, holistic-styled modalities cannot (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:539). The issues of safety , efficacy and quality are therefore not as straightforward or neutral as they appear and raise a number of stubborn philosophical and practica l dilemmas in application to TRM/CAM systems. Resolving such issues are political activities, and practitioner interest groups have much at stake in the outcomes. Applyi ng similar standards for determining efficacy and safety across all forms of TRM/CA M may be inappropriate or inequitable (Thorne et al., 2002:912). The notion of \u0093evidence\u0094 in support o f efficacy, safety or quality is also contested \u0096 the questions of \u0093What evidenc e?\u0094 and \u0093Whose evidence?\u0094 need to be asked (Wahlberg, 2006:128). TRM/CAM may be more appropriatel y studied and evaluated on its own terms as coherent knowledge systems, rather than b eing driven by how much scientific-biomedical knowledge can be \u0093salvaged\u0094 from such practi ces (Pearce, 1986:255). Wahlberg (2006) argues that the focus on safe, proper and appropriate forms of TRM is actually a: continuation of the bio-medical hegemony of the colonial days i n a different guise, that herbal medicine in Vietnam has been \u0093scientifically col onized\u0094 or co-opted, stripped of its original value as a \u0093natural\u0094, \u0093eastern\u0094 or epistemologi cally distinct form of medicine [TRM] is currently being bio-politicized \u0096 i.e. appropriat ed by expert bodies of knowledge that make authoritative and often contested claims as to what constitute the most \u0093appropriate\u0094, \u0093effective\u0094, \u0093safe\u0094 and \u0093responsible\u0094 ways of practising and utilizing it in the service of public health (Wahlberg, 2006:140). 2376.1.3 Access Access is considered only in the context of TRM in the discussion (WHO , 2002e:24-25), and making it both available and affordable. This appears an odd objec tive as in the South, it could be argued that full access already existed and the service d elivery problem related to the dearth of biomedical services. For example, in Africa TRM wa s \u0093perhaps the only health service that is accessible to everyone\u0094 (Airhihenbuwa, 1995:47). It ma y have also been important to address access to CAM in the North, considering that most practitioners work in the private sector (Saks, 2003a:145). Tied to this objective were the safety, efficacy and quality i mperatives. In other words, TRM was to be more extensively monitored and scrutinised to ensure t hat \u0093quality\u0094 services that were safe and effective were delivered. Increased provisio n of \u0093appropriate\u0094 TRM/CAM in health services, the development of associations for TRM/CAM, and criteria and indicators to measure cost-effectiveness were expected outcomes of t his objective (WHO, 2002e:45). The trends of efficiency and effectiveness (economic rational ism) in delivery of health services were applied to TRM in this context. As governments cons idered the role of TRM/CAM \u0093the question inevitably arises as to whether these w ill result in cost savings and whether consumers will be willing to pay for such services\u0094 (Bodeker , 2001c:53). Economic policies and regulatory mechanisms that affect access to hea lth services (such as insurance schemes) may undermine the role of TRM \u0093as serving as the first and last resort for available health care for the poor\u0094 (Bodeker, 2001c:55). Access to affordable TRM is jeopardised by the rapidly increasing gl obal demand (which encourages over harvesting from wild sources) and also from environment al degradation (Schokman, 2004; WHO, 2002e:25). Domestic supply of and access to TRM products and services at the PHC level may therefore be diverted to mee t foreign markets, and the commercial appropriation of TRM knowledge and primary resour ces threatened to reduce access to TRM at community levels. Unresolved intellectual prop erty rights therefore remained a contentious problem (WHO, 2002e:25) and needed to be address ed in legal frameworks. The issue of access illustrates the complexitie s of interaction and interdependencies of economic, environmental, trade, legal and healt h care policies and how these affect access to and utilisation of services. The WHO did not directly confront or mention issues such povert y, education, or the economic reform of health services that impact on access issues to both biomedical and 238TRM services. It encouraged the improving and upgrading TRM/CAM pra ctitioner skills and the conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants (WH O, 2002e:25, 45). However, the WHO emphasised that increasing or improving access to T RM should not supplant the existing biomedical services or priorities in using biome dicine: Evidently, increasing access to safe and effective [tradit ional medicine] should not mean displacing programmes to increase access to allopathic m edicine [biomedicine]. Rather opportunities to improve co-operation between [TRM] pract itioners and allopathic medicine practitioners, should be created, to enable patients to dra w upon both [TRM] and allopathic therapies to best meet their needs (WHO, 2002e:25). 6.1.4 Rational use Rational use of TRM/CAM was to be facilitated via qualifications a nd licensing of practitioners, \u0093proper use\u0094 of products of \u0093assured quality\u0094, provi sion of scientific information and guidance for the public, and information exchange between biomedical and TRM/CAM practitioners (WHO, 2002e:26). Such measures were to \u0093promot e the therapeutically sound use of appropriate TRM/CAM\u0094 (WHO, 2002e:45). Rationality in the use of health care resources is another extreme ly contentious issue. It is generally taken to mean the use of the most effective resource at lowe st cost. However, consumers are considered unable to distinguish between the effe ctiveness and quality of various resources and services, or weigh up various benefits and costs \u0096 which is used to justify state intervention in filtering the health resources a ccessible to the public (Coulter, 2006; Palmer & Short, 2000:24) and the use of biomedical authority to guide consumers (Hufford, 1995). Rationality and its application to health care services and syst ems is confused by the fact that many people (it has been estimated up to 70-80%) seek medical care for c onditions that have no known biological origin (Good et al., 1979:150), and many conditions (perhaps more than 50%) spontaneously heal regardless of the type of intervention of fered (Glasser, 1988:1462; Scarpa, 1981:323). The production, prescription, use and transaction of health care resources has both symbolic and social functions, that provide healing with meaning \u0096 and this is common to both biomedical and TRM systems (van der Geest & Reynolds Whyte, 1989; van der Geest, Reynolds Whyte, & Har don, 1996), although is rarely acknowledged within biomedicine. 239This symbolic social and cultural dimension of health care may produc e what appears to be an inherent \u0093irrationality\u0094 in resource utilisation. However, it can be argued that patients are able to make rational decisions and actually have exclusive acc ess to information in weighing up the benefits of various services. For example, Hufford ( 1995) claims that biomedical practitioners may be able to assess probable outcomes, phy sical risks, amount of pain and so on, but only the patient can give weights to those outcomes, and only the patient can say what effect the treatment had (1995:59). Hufford proposes tha t the mixing of biomedical and TRM/CAM resources by consumers are efforts to \u0093p lace reasonable limits on [bio]medical authority and to maximise overall resources for de aling with illness\u0094 (1995:59). Therefore, despite appearing \u0093irrational\u0094 from a biomedical standpoint, the use of TRM/CAM can fulfil functions that may not be immediately apparent and be a reasonable and pragmatic use of health care resources. The selection and organisation of different health resources varies be tween individuals and according to health conditions, and can be considered as rational pro blem solving (Hufford, 1995:60). Such decision making is sophisticated, and may include e conomic cost-benefits but also goes beyond considerations of cost or scientific evidence o f validity, to include symbolic, social, and cultural values (Craig, 2000; Crandon-Malamud , 1991; Wayland, 2004). This strategy objective implies that there is, and can be a uni versal \u0093rational\u0094 use of such resources (tied to the problematic efficacy and quality o bjectives), when rationality is a socio-culturally constructed phenomenon (Kanji & Hardon, 1992:102-103). Just as the WHO\u0092s definition of essential drugs were tied to fina ncial and biomedical terms, this objective in TRM/CAM use overlooks that \u0093people have their ow n rationalities for deciding on therapies. Irrationality, defined from a [bio]medical v iew, may be totally rational from the consumer\u0092s point of view\u0094 (Kanji & Hardon, 1992:102-103). Kanji and H ardon describe many beliefs and behaviours rooted in TRM concepts, including diverging notions of efficacy and the individualised nature of therapy. What is rat ional treatment for one person in these contexts may not be rational for another. They als o point to economic factors that guide (and sometimes force) resource selection. In doing so, sa ving both time and money is paramount and may conflict with \u0093rationality\u0094 from a biom edical perspective. Rationality in health care can be seen to vary depending upon who the s takeholder is. What is completely rational from a biomedical conceptual perspective ma y be irrational from a TRM/CAM one. Rationality in service provision is undermined by the r ational drive for TRM/biomedical practitioners to provide or supply primary resources to consumers if that ensures secondary resources, regardless of \u0093efficacy\u0094, \u0093vali dity\u0094 or \u0093equity\u0094 considerations. 240Rationality in drug production and supply is driven by rational economic co nsiderations of pharmaceutical industry stakeholders. It is similarly rational fo r consumers to mix primary resources of different medical systems in complicated pattern s. This depends on different variables including income, age, gender, education, ethnicity, rel igion, location and health condition amongst others (Barrett, 2003:418) that affect access to, knowledge of and choice of primary resources. This concern with rationality raises the question that Nichte r asks when he notes that the present pattern of drug production and sales don\u0092t match the epidemiol ogical profile in India: \u0093rational for whom and rational in what contexts? Given the soci al and microeconomic environment in which practitioners function, clinically irrational practices may make economic sense\u0094 (Nichter, 1996:252). Rationality is therefore not a s ingular concept \u0096 there are multitudes of rationalities that conflict and/or coalesc e, producing irrationalities depending on perspective at the health service distribution, supply, and ac cess and/or utilisation levels. 6.2 Discussion and conclusions All of the objectives of the TRM Strategy clearly express underlying biomedical conceptual foundations, values and bias. Navarro criticised the original adopti on of integration based on a modified barefoot doctor approach, as a profoundly political ex perience that was stripped of its political significance \u0096 the de-politicisation of that b eing in itself political (Navarro, 1984:469). The same could be said of the TRM Strategy , in that social, economic, cultural and ethical issues were conflated into a scientific and econom ic rationalist framework (implicitly \u0093value free\u0094) which has political outcomes. The inherent hegemony of the biomedical profession within health care was unquestioned, and ultimately reproduced and perpetuated through the values embedd ed in the objectives. What Lee had anticipated twenty years previously \u0096 that the WHO promoting TRM could accelerate the process of the structural absorption of TRM/ CAM within biomedical systems (Lee, 1982:639)105 was now manifesting. The WHO was promoting certain values and serving particular interests, and the TRM Strategy aims were considered: 105 \u0093In view of the world-wide movement of modernizatio n through science, the [promotion of TRM by WHO, amongst other forces] might turn out to accelerate the absorption, both technically and organizational ly, of the numerous alternative approaches into the scientific biomedical system which will keep on strengtheni ng the structural status of biomedicine\u0094 (Lee, 1982:639) . 241eloquent proof of the need for urgent consideration of the c onsequences of globalization on herbal medicine The assumptions underlying this app roach seem to promote the interests of a global herbal industry over the protection of local tradition al practice (Jagtenberg & Evans, 2003:322). If the seed of this Strategy is taken to be the first resolution o f the World Health Assembly that referred to TRM in 1969, it is not surprising that when it finall y fully germinated as a global policy, it reflected the inherent principles of rationalisat ion of TRM through science and the structural superiority of biomedicine. Resolution WHA22.54 (1969) conce rned the establishment of pharmaceutical production in developing countries, and while \u0093being aware of the differences in the development of therapeutic pra ctices\u0094 it expressed concern about the \u0093hazards and economic wastage connected with the empiric al use of [TRM] as long as their efficacy and safety have not been established.\u0094 However, this was with the awareness t hat \u0093scientific research in this field may yield valuable pha rmaceutical products.\u0094 The principles of scientific validation, safety and efficacy, and biomedical author ity guiding this process, continued throughout the rest of the century and were prominent the mes in many WHO policy and programme documents between the 1970s and 2002. Reissland and Burghart (1989) noted in reference to the original technical report on TRM (WHO, 1978b), that the formulators of the policy acted as \u0093agents of [b io]medicine\u0094 and \u0093rigidly circumscribed the terms of integration\u0094106 and this role was maintained in the TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e). However, biomedical scientific views intrinsic to t he TRM Strategy on the valid production, application and acquisition of medical knowledge and t echniques contrast sharply with the philosophy and practices of many TRM /CAM systems (see Fabrega, 2002; Pearce, 1986; Reynolds, 1986). The policy circle had come full circle by 2002, and even narrowed its ambit despite substantial research into medical pluralism, health economics an d the function and operation of TRM/CAM systems. In 1970s, it had been stressed that the tendency t o give the impression that TRM was limited to medicinal plants exclusively in the health-giving process must not be allowed to continue (WHO, 1978b:10). However, aside fr om the addition of acupuncture, the WHO had concentrated activities largel y on medicinal plants, scientific validation and standardisation. This may be because the W HO accepts the notion 106 \u0093Certain features of [TRM], such as the use of nat ive drugs, were thought to be of benefit but only a fter their efficacy had been proven by the methods of science [TRM] works, but only [bio]medicine knows why\u0094 (Reis 1989:43). biomedical profession \u0096 the belief that scientifi c inquiry produces ideology free knowledge, which is one of the most influential beliefs of o ur times (Young, 1981:379). Allopathic [biomedical] practitioners emphasize the sci entific approach of allopathic medicine, and contend that it is free of cultural values . [TRM systems] have developed rather differently, having been very much influenced by the cult ure and historical conditions within which they first evolved (WHO, 2002d:2, emphasis added). TRM was eventually forced back onto the agenda in order to address the interests of stakeholders, and it appears to mainly serve dominant ones. A very diff erent policy scope and objectives may have resulted if TRM/CAM and biomedicine wer e more equitably weighted in deliberations. For example, Peabody et al., concluded in their review of health policy and system development in Asia that maximising TRM resour ces at PHC level and biomedical at secondary and tertiary levels could be appropriate (s ee Peabody et al., 1999:252). This proposal rationalises health care resources and ser vice structure, but would be met with strong resistance from the biomedical group, as rel inquishing primary resources (such as antibiotics) would entail the loss of secondary resources .107 For many elements of primary care, such as prevention, healt h promotion, and psychosocial support, the evidence suggests [TRM] is comparable and sometimes s uperior to [biomedicine]. For curative care of acute illnesses, [biom edicine] is superior in many areas but [TRM] could be substantially enhanced by training [TRM] providers in the appropriate use of antibiotics [transferring biomedical primary resou rces to TRM] (Peabody et al., 1999:129). The WHO TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) demonstrates subtle management and control of the policy domain by the biomedical profession, who have determined the param eters and priorities of activity. The manipulation of policy formulation was facilitated by biomedical structural dominance in formal health care systems, and org anisational domination within the WHO. The principles of biomedicine permeated the ethos of the organisation \u0096 biomedicine underlies the foundation of the WHO and steered its role from ince ption as a modernising health development body of the UN. Biomedical values and concepts wer e a clear factor influencing policy and programme development on integration bet ween the 1970s and 2002, illustrated by the focus on TRM as an adjunct to biomedicine (initial ly to extend health care services and later as primarily sources for pharmaceuticals), the application of scientific discourse to the TRM realm and sanctioning biomedical authority i n the integration process. 107 Skirmishes over the rights to prescribe or dispens e biomedical primary resources are ongoing, and do not only involve TRM practitioners. For example, in Australia i n 2003 biomedical practitioners strongly resisted g overnment reforms which enabled pharmacists to directly dispe nse emergency contraceptives, circumventing a consult ation with a general practitioner. 243 The following chapter considers the implementation of the integr ation policy in more detail on a national level. A case study of Sri Lanka explores the global-loca l transfer of the policy on integration, how the concept of integration of TRM has been inter preted and applied, what the outcomes are, and how interest groups have influenced or r esponded to the process. 2447. National Case Study: Sri Lanka It may be interesting to see how the indigenous medicine is gradually disappearing in Sri Lanka, even though it has a fully established o fficial status as such. The process of its demise is so subtle enough to go unnoticed. The dominant factor i s, of course, the advent of the western culture. However, though there are many dedicate d souls who are making desperate attempts to preserve and practice it, subtle manoeuvrings can be seen in operation showing the nefarious and potent nature of the antagonistic forces. (Dharmasiri, 1997:178) The model of agenda setting developed by Kingdon (1984) is based on three process streams , and their coupling or intersection, which enables particular policy issues to aris e on the political agenda. This was explained in more detail in the int roduction. Kingdon proposes that this model can be applied to any decision making unit, wheth er an organisation or a national government. Previous chapters have explored the operati on of these streams within an organisation (World Health Organisation), and how their movemen ts have influenced the destiny of WHO traditional medicine policy and its implementati on at national levels. The shifting fortunes of that policy within the organisation can be rel ated to the shifting ebbs and flows of the politics , problems and policies streams . This chapter explores these streams at a national level. This analysis aims to offer insight into the transfer of policy concepts from the international to nation al level, and to demonstrate how the framework formed for analysis from the synthesi s of political science and anthropology theories is valid at both macro (international) and micro (national) levels. In doing so, it becomes immediately apparent that a potential ob stacle in policy transfer is the difference in streams at the international and national levels . The factors shaping and influencing those streams at a national level may vary markedly from that at the international level, resulting in diverse and even conflicting agendas. What appears to be a feasible policy internationally may not transfer coherently at the national level . As mentioned previously, the combination of the theories and framew orks described in the methodology \u0096 primarily Unschuld (1975; 1976b) and Kingdon (1984), but also drawin g on Lee (1982); allows this policy issue to be considered as an intrinsical ly political exercise that has been stimulated by global social and economic forces. A crit ical relationship is focused on \u0096 biomedical and TRM practitioner groups, who operate as interest groups within both the 245politics and policy streams . These groups are motivated by a desire to maintain and incr ease access to primary and secondary resources, apart from their common goa l of providing health care to the community. Tactics to preserve and increase access to secondary resources include professionalisation and the use of scientific discourse. The politics, problems and policy streams surrounding traditional medicine in Sri Lanka are charted in this chapter, again with an emphasis on the politics stream (specifically the interaction between interest groups). While the focus is on the c urrent situation, some history is necessary to place it in context. As Kingdon also noted, the role o f entrepreneurs (advocates) and catalysts are factors and will be considered. The detailed assessment of t he situation in Sri Lanka helps illuminate the difficulties in for mulating and implementing a policy on integration of TRM, and offers insight into why an apparent \u0093 rational\u0094 policy goal is beset with complications and obstacles despite enthusia stic Government statements of support. As described in more detail in the methodology (chapter 2), the impleme ntation of \u0093integration\u0094 and attitudes of stakeholders was explored mainly via an assessment of legislation; resource allocation; policy and programme documents ; activities of professional, research and education/training organisations; and interview s. Appendix 2 (page 354) lists the people interviewed. Information was also gathered from papers given at various conferences, seminars and workshops; and journals, books and newsp apers. 2467.1 Sri Lanka - Background Population 18.7 million Life expectancy 70.7 years (male) 75.4 years (female) Maternal mortality 46.88 per 100 000 live births Infant mortality 12.2 per 1000 live births Crude birth rate 18.9 per 1000 Crude death rate 5.9 per 1000 Literacy 92.5% (male) 87.9% (female) Health expenditure 1.65% of GNP Chikitsa plus a variety of specialists (e.g. bone-setters, those who treat snake bites, burns, mental health, skin diseases). Ayurveda is currently t he official umbrella term for all indigenous forms of medicine. Homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine are also practiced. Use of TRM: Informally estimated to be 75-80% of population at le ast occasionally; 30% first choice (Abeysekera, interview, 25/3/2003). The figure of 75-80% was also cited by others (Samarasekera, interview, 25/3/2003; Wijesekera, interview, 31/3/2003)(Machiko, 1996). While these figures provide a partial and basic overview of Sri Lanka, s tatistics on health, such as these, are almost meaningless in isolation. Despite a low national income, the population of Sri Lanka enjoys a relatively high status of health in co mparison to other countries in the South, especially in mortality, lifespan and social indicators (Perera, 1985:94). For this reason, it has been the subject of some curiosity parti cularly in the matter of constructing low cost health services (Caldwell et al., 1989; Hal stead, Walsh, & Warren, 1985) and was considered by the WHO (1978b) in their initial assessment o f TRM in health systems. The biomedical health infrastructure was established unde r British rule, and the fact that it is universal and free has been considered a major contribut ory factor to the good 108 Statistics were sourced from the \u0093Sri Lanka Health Atlas\u0094 (WHO, 2003d). Accurate statistics are diffic ult to obtain due to a lack of official record keeping and data c ollection, and the frequent omission of figures fro m North/Eastern provinces. 247health indices (see Caldwell et al., 1989). There is a particular ly strong emphasis on maternal and child health at the community level, with a broad network of nurse s/midwives. Commitment to a variety of social democratic principles (such a s compulsory, free education; voluntary family planning; some subsidised foo d items) means that it is actually very difficult to isolate the factors responsible for the impressi ve health gains evident between independence in 1948 and the 1980s109 \u0096 was it due to the biomedical infrastructure, the fact it is free, the midwives at community level, the educatio n system, declining fertility levels, the mixing of TRM and biomedicine or some other factor/s ? Others also questioned the causal relationship between these factors \u0096 for example the decrease in infant mortality may not have simply been due to supervision during birth: [W]hy [was it] claimed that it was solely because births we re professionally supervised that infant mortality decreased in Sri Lanka? If there were a ro ad and a school, as well as a maternity ward, how [was it known] that they, and nutriti on, had nothing to do with the improvement? (Mackenzie, 1978:118) The civil war between Tamil separatists and the majority Sinha lese in the North and East of Sri Lanka over the past three decades has diverted funds from social policy to military and defence (see UNDP, 2004). The universal biomedical infrastructure h as suffered partly as a consequence , particularly in the war afflicted North and East regions (Hsiao, 2000: 88-89), which represents approximately one quarter to one third of the land ma ss. Outside of urban areas, the biomedical infrastructure is unevenly distributed.110 In contrast, the traditional system of medicine (Ayurveda) is widespread, with a practit ioner in almost every village (Schokman, 2004). Ayurvedic and biomedical services are provided in a parall el form by the Government, at no charge. However, the formal Ayurvedic service is m uch smaller in comparison and the majority of Ayurvedic practitioners operate i n the private sphere. In their study of the factors responsible for the health indices in Sri L anka, Caldwell et. al. (1989) argued that this was more or less solely due to the densit y of the universal provision of biomedical care, and the education system which enabled eff ective utilisation of health services. The only role that Ayurveda was deemed to have played was in paving the way for more ready acceptance of biomedicine and providing a receptive aud ience to public health 109 Sri Lanka (along with Costa Rica, China and Cuba) achieved exceptional health indices despite being a l ow income country and investing comparatively small amount s in health. Mortality and morbidity statistics, pop ulation growth rates and literacy are above average for Sou th Asia. However, these improvements appeared to pl ateau by the end of the century (Jayasinghe, 2002:6). 110 For example \u0096 there are only 3.1 government hospital beds per 100 000 people in Sri Lanka. The three la rge, urban districts (Colombo, Kandy, Jaffna) have a hig her percentage of beds, while in Vavuniya district t he bed strength is only 1.7 per 100 000. Fifteen districts have no facilities for hospitalised care of psychia tric patients (WHO, 2003d:29). See also (Jayasinghe & Mendis, 2002 ) for an overview of the operation of the health sys tem. However, Hsiao (2000:83) concluded it is \u0093highly effi cient\u0094 in its use of resources from an international perspective. 248measures (as in Kerala, India - which also enjoyed unusually low mort ality indicators, a high level of literacy and female education, and a strong tradition of Ay urveda) (Caldwell et al., 1989:366). The \u0093massive and continuing\u0094 trend towards the utilisation of bi omedicine was despite the \u0093financial and moral support\u0094 given by the Government to A yurveda (Caldwell et al., 1989:373). While this observation implied a naturally evolving prefe rence for biomedicine, the differential and lesser status of Governmental suppor t accorded to indigenous systems of medicine was not acknowledged. The study by Caldwell et. al. is extremely comprehensive, but has drawn some conclusions which may be arguable. For example, it was noted that treatments employed usually consisted of both home remedies and biomedicine, although home remedies were not considered part of TRM knowledge systems. This was despit e the fact that these are based on Ayurvedic pharmacopeia known in families, and utilised more fre quently than biomedicine as a first resort. Also, factors that may have inf luenced the behaviour noted and health outcomes achieved - such as dietary and lifestyle habits/be liefs, and the recognition of sickness symptoms that prompted fast treatment were not traced to the influence of Ayurveda. Ayurveda has detailed knowledge systems and principles on thes e, amongst other health issues. However, the fact that TRM is an inextricable pa rt of the social and cultural fabric makes it very difficult to determine and measure its influence.111 Despite some anomalies in data collection (such as the ambiguous distinction between home remedies and Ayurveda) which may have led to an overestimation of the role of biomedicine and underestimation of TRM, the Caldwell study (1989:377) provides an overview of utilisation of health services in the 1980s. The finding that biomedic al services were cheaper and more accessible than TRM may not be current in light of the ongo ing civil war, and subsequent fragmentation of social services outside of urban are as. The study clearly demonstrates the complexity of isolating factors responsible for good health, the difficulties of analysing data, the complicated patterns of health care utili sation where TRM and biomedicine co-exist, and causal directions or proportionate roles when a cluster of social services are provided. For example, while it is concluded that the biomedical services were responsible for the health outcomes, it was also concluded that th is system would not have been \u0093very effective on its own\u0094 (Caldwell et al., 1989:377). As well as providing a model of parallel integration of TRM, Sri La nka also presented an early example of an \u0093essential drugs\u0094 programme prior to the ad option of this scheme by the 111 See (Obeyesekere, 1976) for more information on ind igenous medicine in Sri Lanka. 249WHO in 1977. It may therefore have presented an inspiration or model to the international community for both the utilisation of TRM as well as the adoption of an essential drugs approach. Sri Lanka was very progressive in both areas. Strictly speaking, the Sri Lankan case cannot be considered an example of policy transfer between global-local levels as the policy on traditional medicine already existed domestically prior to international endorsement, although in a different form to that promoted by the WH O (parallel, not integrative) and not extensively articulated.112 The reform of the pharmaceutical industry in the 1970s did not go unchal lenged (Lall & Bibile, 1978), and proved ominously prophetic for the later experie nces of the WHO and other nations who attempted to emulate this scheme (see Chowdary, 1995; Kanji et al., 1992; Reich, 1987). Just as witnessed later with the essential drugs sche me, in Sri Lanka the biomedical profession and pharmaceutical companies strongly resi sted reform throughout the 1970s. Those observing the implementation of the program to rationalise t he production and distribution of pharmaceuticals in order to reduce costs warne d others to \u0093proceed with great care and immense caution\u0094 (Lall & Bibile, 1978:299) and drew some very s alient conclusions (Lall & Bibile, 1978:324-326). This included noting that it was d ifficult to foresee genuine reform of this sector being undertaken \u0093without a long term and powerful socialist ideology base\u0094 (Lall & Bibile, 1978:325) and an assessment th at very few countries actually met the requirements to successfully launch such a conce pt (Lall & Bibile, 1978:326). It is interesting that the commitment to the provision of social serv ices has often been tied to Buddhist principles (not socialist ideology) in commentary by some Sr i Lankan nationals. For example, Obeyeskere (in Mackenzie, 1978:118) referred to the Bud dhist notion of providing these services to the poor as \u0093meritorious\u0094 and Perara (1985) similarly traced the establishment of health care to Buddhism. The culture of Sri Lanka is thus tightly linked to and identified with Buddhism, the protection and promotion of which w as enshrined in the controversial 1972 Constitution. There also appears to be a strong link be tween Buddhism and TRM systems of health care (see Liyanaratne, 1999). For examp le, temples and clergy have an historical and contemporary role in the preservation o f Ayurvedic knowledge; as authors, teachers and practitioners; in the provision of some services, awareness and education campaigns; and distribution of some TRM remedies and he rbal preparations (which is supported by the Government). 112 The concept of global-local transfer could more accurately be considered local-global transfer, as models or concepts appear to be inspired from one or more loca tions, adopted at an international level and then tr anslated and implemented in a variety of other contexts globally. Essential Drugs, PHC and TRM policies all display thi s pattern. 250 According to the Government, Ayurveda is an umbrella term that inc ludes all systems of indigenous medicine (such as Siddha , Unani and Desiya Chikitsa ) as well as any medicine practiced in Asia, so is broader in scope than the normal definiti on of Ayurveda. This reflects the heterogenous context of multiple TRM systems in Sri Lanka, whic h is partly an outcome of ancient trading routes. The indigenous system ( Desiya Chikitsa ) resulted from traditions (Ranaweera, This flexibility in definition also allows other sys tems of medicine (e.g. traditional Chinese medicine) to be included in the ambit of officia lly recognised TRM \u0096 or indigenous systems of medicine (ISM) as it is referred to in Sri Lanka. There is currently a proposal to restrictively re-define \u0093Ayurveda\u0094 and make the broad er and more representative \u0093ISM\u0094 an umbrella term instead. Ayurveda itself is more accurately divided into two groups who compe te with each other (Kasturaratchi, interview 1/12/04). Desiya Chikitsa can be seen as a localised form of Ayurveda, while Ayurveda itself is Indian in origin and more formal ised in education and practice. While all systems of medicine mentioned have a role in health care, this analysis considers only Ayurveda in the strictest sense \u0096 that form of TRM which originated in India and is taught in state recognised institutions. This is for purposes of clarity, due to limitations of time and space, and also because Ayurveda is the most direct and str ongest competitor to biomedicine in Sri Lankan health policy. Therefore, Ayurveda is t he focus of this analysis and the main form of TRM considered whilst acknowledging that a sim ple dichotomy between Ayurveda and biomedicine does not exist in Sri Lanka. In the national health care system, while indigenous and biomedical systems operate in parallel form and there is consumer utilisation of both, it does no t mean this relationship is necessarily harmonious. As in other countries, while the confli ct and competition between medical systems may be covert it is evident in policy and programm e development. This subtle battle may not be clearly articulated or apparent to those observing the interaction of medical systems at practitioner levels \u0096 for example, Waxler (1984) con cluded there was no competition. This idealistic conclusion developed in the er a when anthropologists were assessing the operation of pluralistic medical systems, and m ay have led to a premature assumption of an amicable relationship. The development, forms and use of TRM in Sri Lanka have been studi ed by several anthropologists besides Waxler (1984; 1988) including Wolffers (1988; 1989) an d Nordstrom (1988). Sri Lanka is considered an \u0093interesting laborato ry\u0094 to examine pluralistic 251medical systems, as Ayurveda and biomedicine formally coexist (W axler-Morrison, 1988:531). The focus of this research is on the institutional relationsh ip between the two systems of medicine and TRM policy and programme development, ra ther than the dynamics and rationales of consumer utilisation or the functioning of individual pr actitioners. Therefore, the political relationship between medical systems as e xpressed in government policy and health system development is concentrated on, with reference to practitioners and professional representative bodies as relevant interest groups. 7.1.1 Development and status of TRM in formal health care Sri Lanka was subject to continuous colonisation for over 400 years \u0096 firstly from the Portuguese (from 1505), later the Dutch (from 1658) and then British (1796-1948). Under colonial rule, Ayurveda was neglected and biomedicine became structura lly dominant (see Dharmasiri, 1997; Perera, of existence\u0094 (Goonewardene, 2004). This was an anomalous situation. The modern system of medi cine which was adopted and encouraged by the government catered to only a small fracti on of the population. The indigenous system which a great majority of the population pract iced was not given due recognition. There was very little awareness at least am ong the ruling classes and the elite of the value of Ayurveda as a science. The higher classes in so ciety, faithfully imitating the West, looked down upon indigenous culture as something inferior. Even the pr actitioners of Ayurveda medicine were referred to by a term generally considered to be derogatory \u0096 quite in contrast to the position that prevailed some centuries previ ously (Wanninayaka, 1982:9). However, as a corollary to the \u0093freedom movement\u0094 to obtain independence , indigenous systems of medicine were promoted (Ranaweera, 2001:13). Along with ag itation for political independence, some concessions were made for the development of Ayurved a (Wanninayaka, 1982:11). The timeline of significant events in rel ation to TRM (appendix 9; page 366) reveals three phases of development: 1900-1940s was a period of lobb ying, assessment and obtaining official recognition; 1950-1960 was a period of a pparent inactivity at the regulatory and legislative level (perhaps a consolidat ion of previous gains made and a reflection of political effort and resources being devoted to inde pendence activities); 1960s- 2000 was a period of gradual expansion and enhancement of professional status and official recognition. This activity rapidly increased at the turn of the ce ntury. These approximate epochs are of course generalised, as the status of TRM waxed and waned throughout and the course of progress was not smooth. 252After independence, formal legislative recognition was achieved and a parallel infrastructure developed under a Department of Ayurveda within the Ministry of Healt h. In 1980, a Ministry was created (without Cabinet representation) giving Sri La nka the distinction of being the only country in the world with a Minister of Indigenous Medicine ( Wolffers, 1988:545). However, this Ministry did not always operate as a discrete body an d its fortunes were closely tied to the political complexion of the government o f the day. While a distinct department for indigenous medicine was a politic al asset, being placed within the Ministry of Health allowed for continuing structural domina tion by biomedicine. Ayurveda was alluded to as intervie w, 31/3/2003) or \u0093poor whenever it was placed a longside the biomedical fraternity in the Ministry of Health. In any statute or r egulation regarding Ayurveda, the term \u0093Minister\u0094 always meant the Minister of Healt h (not the Minister of Indigenous Medicine), who was also responsible for appointments to Ayurvedi c statutory bodies (Wanninayaka, 1982:13). Administratively and politically, the domina nce of biomedicine was embedded in the regulatory mechanisms governing the Ayurvedic sector. Bureaucratically, there has been an ongoing struggle for funds an d status (secondary resources) and Ayurveda was moved between Ministries according to the government of the day. In 2000, a separate Cabinet Ministry for Indigenous Medicine (IM) was c reated. This meant that at Cabinet level, for the first time, Ayurveda had independen t status and was not within the general health portfolio or any other Ministry. This in creasing political power corresponded with a rapid increase in power of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party, with a socialist and nationalistic agenda. However, although na tionalistic sentiment gained strength, it is not clear if there is a direct correlation between this and the establishment of an independent Ayurvedic portfolio. The growing economic strength (seconda ry resources) of this sector may also have been an impetus. By the late 1990s, the po tential value of the rapidly increasing export market had been realised and Ayur veda acquired an elevated status attached to the newly acquired foreign demand. The Indigenous Medicine Cabinet Ministry was short lived, and after 10 mon ths there was a Cabinet re-shuffle and Ayurveda was placed into a new Ministry of H ealth, Nutrition and Welfare. This constant re-shuffling continued due to political ins tability, with Indigenous Medicine being placed with Disaster Relief (2003) before again achie ving an independent Ministry in 2004. The lack of political power and status of Ayurveda with in government is illustrated by the fact that in the six year period between 1998 and 2003, there were as many changes at Ministry level, with new Ministers, and/or new portf olios. While Ayurveda was 253recognised as an important part of Sri Lankan heritage and health c are provision, the portfolio seemed precarious, and appeared to be moved on whim accor ding to political sentiment which could rapidly change. This was assisted by the fact that it was not compulsory to appoint a Minister for Indigenous Medicine and so Ayurveda co uld \u0093float\u0094 between Ministries, and not all Ministers achieved Cabinet repres entation. The history and operation of the formal indigenous medicine sector de monstrates that the politics and problems streams (such as changes of government, manoeuvring within parliament, the development of new issues such as environmental conse rvation and economic growth of the sector) directly affected the status and f ortune of TRM at the national level. Status and resources allocated to the sector were closely related to the contemporary political situation, from the time of official r ecognition earlier in the century aligned with the independence movement, right through to the more rece nt changes of fortune. The political instability of the national government contin ued to affect the formal and consistent development of the TRM sector. For example, with each successive ministerial change, there we re corresponding budgetary and administrative changes which meant that policy and programme development was delayed or interrupted. Legislative development was also hindered by this insecurity and volatility at Central Government level. In 1998, amendments to the Ayurveda Act of 1961 were drafted. This was to take into account the growth of markets (requiring standardisation of herbal remedies) and the new tourism based activity which could not be regulated under the auspices of the original legislation. Therefore, the growth of se condary resources (economic benefits) attached to the TRM sector necessitated incre ased regulation and oversight. It was considered easier and faster to amend the 1961 Act than to repe al it and draft a new legislative code. A new Act was also drafted for Ayurvedic Drugs, Cos metics and Devices which meant Ayurveda was covered by two Acts (one for practitioners, on e for drugs), as well as a code for intellectual property. However, although this had a lmost reached approval stage in 1998, in 1999 there was a change in Government and for one year it remained in limbo with no action taken. The subsequent Minister appointed then r e-considered it, subjected it to further review and made some changes before another c hange of Government and cabinet shuffle. Responsibility for drafting the legislation on intellectual property was then transferred from the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine to the Ministry o f Commerce and then Trade, reflecting the shifting focus of this issue from one of hea lth to one of economics. 254Currently, this legislation is still pending finalisation and Ca binet approval. The further development of Ayurveda is impeded by the lagging policy formulation and implementation, and delayed regulatory frameworks. It was estimated that it would re ceive cabinet approval in the first quarter of 2005, but it is st ill being finalised. Alongside this increasing legislative and regulatory status is an anticipated increase in fiscal appr opriation, in recognition of both recent policy formulation undertaken and tourism and industry growth . The government was willing to allocate more resources to the sector as it became cle arer that this sector can generate income (indicating that resources will be provided if sec ondary resources such as economic benefits are returned) (Abeysekera, interview, S Karunasena, interview, 25/10/04). As demonstrated on the global level in the case of the WHO, the budget ary position and power of TRM in central decision making aspects of health policy is min imal. However, status in policy making has been enhanced with economic leverage ( such as the potential for secondary resources to be generated via health tourism and commercia l cultivation) and with heightened nationalistic sentiment. Policy formulation and imp lementation were also highly dependant upon specific entrepreneurs (advocates) who guided or pushed the policy process further, as well as receptiveness at senior bureaucratic lev els. This is similar to the development of TRM policy on an international level within the WHO, where similar obstacles and impetus were observed. The changing political fortunes of Ayurveda at central government level can often be linked to certain people or policy platforms of particular parties. For example, particular Ministers (Lokubandara, Soysa, Bandranaike) or Presidents (Kumaratunga) who ar e favourable or sympathetic to TRM are often cited as being responsible for improved s tatus and support. The initial establishment of the Indigenous Medicine Department in 1980 was the result of a push from a senior parliamentarian who was an Ayurvedic practitioner (WHO , 2001b:139). President Kumaratunga urged provincial councils to establish medicinal herb gardens and Ayurvedic laboratories to increase the production of Ayurvedic medicine s (Schokman, 2004). Just as Mahler was crucial in the WHO at the international l evel, certain entrepreneurs (advocates) and catalysts were essential to promote such policies within the Sri Lankan government. While appealing to popular sentiment is unproblematic, transform ing the platitudes to substantial programme development backed with budgetary commitment is more difficult. For example, in early 2003, the Minister for Indigenous Medicine and Disa ster Relief (Rajakaruna) announced an initiative where all hospitals would have an Ayurvedic ward 255staffed by an Ayurvedic practitioner (Gampaha group correspondent, 2003). Howe ver, by late 2004 no steps had been taken to implement this initiative and it a ppeared to be a discarded political gesture. Another example of this type of gesture occurred in 2004 when an Ayurvedic clinic was opened in the national Parliament at the instigation of the speaker (Lokubandara) \u0096 who was also a previous Minister for Indigenous Medicine . Such symbolic rather than practical measures may be resorted to in order to gain c onstituent support, yet avoid politically contentious or sensitive resource reallocation issues. Officially, the Ayurvedic sector is usually overlooked. Most policy an d planning documents regarding health refer only to biomedicine. For example, the most recent WHO country plan for Sri Lanka makes no mention of traditional medicine. The Heal th Atlas, an official overview of health infrastructure and status, likewise does not recogni se Ayurveda. On the basis of such documents, it could easily be concluded that no form of TRM exists in Sri Lanka, and that the thousands of practitioners are not officially co nsidered health care personnel. Despite political recognition, TRM has limited structural st rength in the health care system. Health development in Sri Lanka is generally restric ted to the narrow ambit of those areas that fall within the purview of the Department of Hea lth (such as disease control and prevention), and strictly to biomedicine (Wanasinghe, 2002:12). 7.1.2 Current organisation and distribution Sri Lanka operates with central, provincial (8) and district (22) levels of government. Within each district, local government areas operate. Functions vary betw een levels of government, with both biomedical and Ayurvedic hospitals and dispensaries unive rsally provided free of charge. Biomedicine dominates the health care system stru cturally and absorbs around 96- 98% of the health care budget. About 85% of total expenditure is absorbed in tertiary care (hospital based) (de Mel, 2002:70). This budgetary allocation is a clear indicator of structural strength and power of the sectors in the formal health care syste m. Under the constitution, Ayurveda is devolved to provincial level, although the Central government retains responsibility for some functions (e.g. research , education and training). There are 3 central government teaching hospitals, 46 provincial counc il hospitals, 121 provincial council dispensaries and 230 local government dispensari es. There are also four herbal gardens, a drug production facility and a research institut e. An organisational chart for Ayurvedic public sector administration is attached (appendix 10; page 367). This complicated administrative arrangement may have led to what c an be considered a lack of 256cohesiveness between training and service delivery, an uneven distr ibution of facilities, and a lack of clear responsibility for co-ordination. Table 4: Public sector health sector fac ilities (Sri Lanka) No. of facilities No. of beds No. treated Biomedicine 855 48 632 40 066 528 Ayurveda 147 2 203 957 932 Table reproduced from (Liyanage, 2002:114) Table 5: Budget allocation for Ayurvedic sector (in Sri Lankan rupees, 000) 1998 1999 2000 2001 Health (total) 11135 16668 17869 17406 Ayurveda 172 213 521 744 Table reproduced from (Ranaweera, 2001:8) It can be seen from the above tables that the formal, public Ayurvedic sector is dwarfed by the biomedical sector. It should be noted that the private Ayurve dic sector is much larger than the public sector, although accurate data on both the public and pri vate sectors is difficult to obtain. For example, statistics and figures vary widely between documents as to the number of public Ayurvedic institutions and patients treated. Ran aweera (2001), when Secretary of Indigenous Medicine, quoted figures of over 400 indigenous medical health institutions (including both dispensaries and hospitals) treating over 4 million patients. However, it is acknowledged that indigenous medicine is largely in the pr ivate sector and mainly home and community based (MoH, 2003:6.39). Regardless of varied statistics, it is clear that there is a very skeletal formal Ayurvedic sector, with an ongoing struggle to maintain services and resources. T he government assessment of Ayurvedic infrastructure acknowledges that the facilities are unevenly spread across regions, and that there is a need for more resources and more effective networking (MoH, 2003:6.24). Furthermore, the draft health master plan concedes that TRM in the public sector has not been fully utilised for health care delivery, and that demands for T RM have not been adequately met (MoH, 2003:6.29). So, while biomedicine is absorbing t he vast majority of funds and dominating service delivery, TRM infrastructure has been negl ected to the detriment of sufficient supply. 257The budgetary allocation to indigenous medicine has significantly incre ased (Table 5), especially in 2000 when Ayurveda achieved Ministry status. This new pol itical power appeared to enable a larger appropriation, and funds allocated more than doubled from the previous year. In proportion to the total health budget, Ayurveda was alloc ated 1.54% in 1998, and then nearly doubled to 2.91% in 2000 before climbing to 4.27% in 2001. Despite rapidly increasing, the proportion of secondary resources alloc ated to Ayurveda is still quite small and the vast amount of health expenditure is dedicated to biomedicine. Most people interviewed who mentioned the budget for Ayurveda provided a figure of 2% or less (Jayasinghe, interview, 20/12/04; Samarasekera, interview, 25/03/03). In terms of personnel, there is approximately double the number of A yurvedic practitioners than biomedical practitioners. However, many more practitioners ( both Ayurvedic and biomedical) are not registered. It is estimated that there are 6800 gov ernment biomedical doctors (about half of which may be engaged in private practice aft er working hours), and 600-800 full time private biomedical practitioners. There are 15000 registe red Ayurvedic practitioners (Jayasuriya, 2002:66). This figure is disputed by some, who believe the figure may be inflated by the registration of Ayurvedic doctors who are not fu lly qualified (Kasturaratchi, interview 1/12/04). The variety of TRM systems operating within Sri Lanka adds considera ble complexity to the situation. While all systems of TRM are represented by the Ayurved a Act 1961, they are not administratively equal. The hierarchy and domination by Ayurveda i s most obviously reflected in the nomenclature used to describe TRM \u0096 Ayurveda as a n umbrella term is neither accurate nor universally accepted. The suggestion to change the um brella term to \u0093indigenous systems of medicine\u0094 is considered a political manoeuvre as it allows the inclusion or exclusion of various groups according to political whi m (Kasturaratchi, interview 1/12/04). The majority of resources within the TRM sec tor are also allocated to Ayurveda. The small budgetary allocation to TRM is therefore apport ioned internally along political lines. It is unclear whether Ayurveda is the largest TRM prac titioner group compared to Desiya Chikitsa , but formal government support has enabled the structural expansion of it and subsequent domination over other indigenous systems. It is interesting (although not unexpected) to find that the vari ous systems of TRM within that sector form a hierarchy of power. This reflects their ethnic /class origins and the corresponding size of their constituent community and its political and economic power. Ayurveda dominates followed by Desiya Chikitsa (Sinhalese), Siddha (Tamils) and Unani Besides these more form alised systems are 258various specialties (often hereditary in professional lineage) \u0096 the lowest in ranking of power and prestige due to their fragmentation, diffusion, lack of orga nisation and institutionalisation. This includes bone-setters and those who tr eat snake bites, burns, mental health, and skin conditions. As the theory developed by Unschuld proposes, power relations and co nflict for resources between medical systems can be seen to distort health system deve lopment not only in relation to Ayurveda and biomedicine ( between sectors), but within the TRM sector as well. There is a perpetual struggle to secure primary and secondary reso urces, the success of which is directly related to the political power enjoyed by that sector \u0096 seen here as parallel to that of the ethnic group from which the system originates. The hier archy of power and status is thus clearly Ayurveda, Desiya Chikitsa , Siddha , Unani ) and directly linked to the proportion of secondary resources secured (statu s, funding). Another example of how power relations between ethnic groups influen ce the interaction between the indigenous systems of medicine is obvious in relation t o Ayurveda and Siddha (which is practiced mainly by Tamils). After communal riots i n 1983, the Siddha teaching faculty at Colombo University was transferred to the Jaffna cam pus in the Tamil dominated Northern region. This can be seen as a form of educational partitio n, and Siddha receives far less formal support than Ayurveda. The interaction and exchange of in formation between these systems is limited and difficult (D. Perera, interview 9/ 12/2004), reflecting the tensions between Tamil and Sinhalese ethnic groups more broadly. Currently, the organisation and distribution of the health care sys tem suffers from a variety of challenges including under-funding, a lack of strategic policy developm ent, and administrative confusion as a result of devolution (Hsiao, 2000:89-90). Such factors have contributed to sub-optimal functioning, which is also impeded by a lack of reliable information, fragmented financing, poor regulatory structures and i nadequate responses to emerging needs (Jayasinghe & Mendis, 2002:124-126). Biomedical structural domina tion of the health care system has enabled it to secure the vast majo rity of secondary resources, and has distorted the development of integrated delivery incorpor ating TRM. The dominant ideology is biomedical and the funding is biased towards the curative/te rtiary sectors (Jayasinghe & Mendis, 2002:126) regardless of stated government support for TRM over several decades, and despite the fact that it offers a cost effect ive approach for long term care management (MoH, 2003:6.39). 2597.1.3 National policy and programme development Policy and programme development in relation to Ayurveda has been impeded by a lack of political commitment and resources. The current organisational s tructure of Ayurvedic services has also hindered effective co-ordination and operation . The government has been criticised for paying \u0093lip service\u0094 to the promotion and develop ment of TRM (Wijesekera, interview, 31/3/2003). Policy often takes a more symbolic than practical dimension, with the first national policy proposed in 2004. This is still in draft form . Despite the international support for this concept and continuing national government stateme nts of support for integration, progress is slow and the national TRM policy is stil l in embryonic stages. The difficulty of political instability and lack of will is c ompounded by a lack of human and financial resources, and historically weak strategic policy abil ity within the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine. For example, it lacked a planning and development unit until 2004. In addition, the multidimensional nature of TRM means that issues are often split between or across portfolios. For example, agriculture, environment, scie nce and technology, trade and tourism now all have a role in TRM, and central co-ordination is vital. As long as the Indigenous Medicine Ministry lacks political power and financial and ma npower resources, this is beyond its capacity operationally. As at the global level , TRM is being pulled in different directions by different interests, making local (comm unity level) development problematic. In government planning documents, the integration of TRM and biomed icine is still referred to as a vague concept, a future activity, and cautiously worded : Integration of the services of both allopathic [biomedical] and indigen ous sectors is expected to be carefully done in relevant areas with the understan ding and consent of both sectors based purely on the benefit of the patients without contradi ctions in the basic concepts of both systems of medicine (MoH, 2003:6.30). Such ambiguous statements hint at the practical difficulties in formalising the role of TRM in the health care sector in an equitable manner. It is also a covert re cognition of the lack of progress in integration since the 1970s. The piecemeal and symbolic f ormal development of the Ayurvedic sector is recognised by academics and commentators as well as other organisations. For example, Dharmasiri notes \u0093The government is sa id to support [Ayurveda]. But it is minimal and nominal\u0094 (1997:160) and Edirisinghe comme nts that \u0093the gulf between the policy support and the actual task of putting into prac tice the policy decisions remain as wide as ever\u0094 (1987:168). The World Bank (1997:4) considere d the 260weakness of policy and programme implementation, and lack of resour ce commitment, to result from an emphasis on other political and economic priorities. The Health Master Plan, which was drafted by the Government in 2003, regarded the highest priority in the TRM sector to be the administrative restructuring of the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine (MoH, 2003). This included the establishment of poli cy, project management, legislation and intellectual property rights sections . Such structural changes would improve institutional capacity to develop the appropriate progra mmes and ensure regulatory frameworks were adequate. Also high on the list of prior ities was developing an Ayurvedic formulary to guide the manufacture, quality control and f ormulation of products under specified standards. This reflects the need to address rapid market growth. Over the last decade, numerous Ayurvedic clinics catering to increas ing foreign demand for natural health treatments have been established. This market has grown concurrently with an export market for herbal products. Around 60% of raw materials for Ay urvedic remedies are imported from India or Nepal and supply is failing to meet curren t demand for both domestic and international markets (MIM, 2001:20-21; Schokman, 2004). This has be en compounded by international environmental conventions (e.g. Convention on Intern ational Trade of Endangered Species) which prohibit trade in threatened species . India is gradually introducing restrictions on the export of raw herbs, which may se riously affect the Sri Lankan market (MIM, 2001:21). For example, red sandalwood can no longer be so urced from India and saplings planted to make up the shortfall will take around 4 de cades to mature. The resource base of TRM is thus under extreme pressure, and ther e is a need to effectively balance and prioritise environmental, economic and lo cal health matters. Between 1995 and 2000, the sales of Ayurvedic medicinal products approxi mately doubled (see table 6). The middle column of table 6 was unlabelled, but it ma y be the volume of production. Production reached an optimal level in 2000 under current f acilities, and cannot expand further without equipment upgrade and improvements in the supply of raw m aterial (MIM, 2001:19-23). The main problem encountered by the Ayurvedic Drug s Corporation is inability to supply demand, with only around 70% of the demand from the public s ector met and a large portion of the open market remaining unserved (MIM, 2001:20, 21). In order to address problems in supply of raw materials, the Ministry propos ed to promote the cultivation of herbs as an economic crop (MIM, 2001:21). This corresponds w ith international trends from the mid to late 1990s to commercialise T RM. 261Table 6: Value of production of Ayurved ic medicinal produc ts (rs. million) Year Sales 1995 Table reproduced from (MIM, 2001:19) The rapid increase in sales was fuelled by a surge in demand fr om foreigners \u0096 a market growth that was stretching the domestic production capacity. This unant icipated market development opened a window of opportunity for Ayurveda on the domestic pol itical agenda. More government support for the Ayurvedic sector could be garne red when economic returns (secondary resources) were assured (Abeyseker a, interview, 25/03/03; interview, 25/10/04). Therefore, increased funding was directed to the indigenous medical sector in order to improve production capacity and deve lop the required regulatory frameworks. This accounts for more than a quadrupl ing of funding between 1998 (when the accelerating value of the export market was realise d) and 2001 (see table 5). A burgeoning export market exposed the weaknesses in existing policy, m anufacturing and research programmes. While the production and use of Ayurvedic medic ines for local use did not have to conform to strict regulations (NSTC, 2002:11) such as quali ty control, labelling and packaging requirements, handling, storage and so on \u0096 e xport markets were a different matter. This new imperative to industrialise a nd commercialise medicinal plant crops was dependant upon establishing scientific validation of s afety and efficacy as well as resolving issues such as intellectual property rights. The assess ment of industry capacity in 2002 repeatedly emphasised medicinal plants as source of foreig n exchange and the need to meet international standards to capitalise on foreign market s (NSTC, 2002: 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15, 31, 41). Scientific validation was also deemed essential to adequate ly integrate TRM into the health care system, as stated in both the Health Master Plan (2003) and d raft National Policy on Indigenous Medicine (2004). Strengthening the research capacity of the sector was crucial in order to \u0093make the ISM sector more scientifically evidenced base d\u0094 and this data is required for effective integration (MoH, 2003:6.58). 262 There is an urgent need to establish the safety and effica cy of ISM therapies and drugs on the basis of experimental evidence for the ISM to be integrated i nto the healthcare system in modern Sri Lanka (MIM, 2004) The neglect of such research had therefore hindered both the i ntegration of TRM on the domestic level and also now threatened the ability to respond to and develop an export market. As Lee (1982) argued, the role of scientific discourse is c rucial in order to gain structural strength in the modern state. Scientific validation provides credibility and a rationale for resource allocation. In this case, the adoption of sc ientific ideology and values is directly linked to the global market evolving for the products. T he catalyst was economic and related to the generation of lucrative secondary resources. H ence, increased activity in the policy arena for TRM was visible in the late 1990s and from 2000 includin g drafting a national policy and attempting to resolve intellectual property r ights issues. This corresponded with the situation observed on an international level within the WHO as well as in a variety other countries with a history of traditional medicin e. While progress in policy and programme development had been tardy in the period between the 1970s and mid 1990s, it was suddenly propelled by the international grow th in demand for herbal health care products in the mid-late 1990s. To develop expo rt markets necessitated an intensification of activity in domestic policy, and a range of act ivities across a variety of portfolios. Therefore, resources were finally allocated and policies to address pressing issues were drafted. This also tied in with international conservation and environmental agendas. The politics stream became conducive to developing the sector nationally, and the international demand for such products was acknowledged as a factor at the forefront of political activity. The politics , problems and policy streams therefore merged and TRM was elevated on the political agenda. This was evident with Indigenous M edicine achieving Cabinet representation in 2000, the rapid increases in funding allocated to the sector and the drafting of policy and legislation in relation to TRM. 7.2 WHO Activities It is difficult to effectively gauge the activities of the WHO in r elation to TRM in Sri Lanka. It does not appear to be a priority or to be even taken into account in policy and programme development. The WHO is dominated by the biomedical profession and con sidered inactive in the field of TRM (Dharmasiri, interview, 14/12/04). For example , there is no WHO officer responsible for TRM, even as a partial task. The WHO library in Col ombo has very few 263documents on TRM, including none of the key documents issued by Headqua rters. In contrast to reference sections dedicated to particular diseases or health issues (such as tobacco use) there was no corollary for TRM. The WHO country doc uments on Sri Lanka also made no reference to TRM. The exclusively biomedical focus (and continuing emphasis on vertical interventions) was clearly reflected in staffing, s tructure, funding allocation and information resources. At country level, the resolutions of the World Health Assembly may therefore not be accorded high status or implemented fully. However, in the 1980s some i nitiatives were undertaken which reflected the international interest in and com mitment to TRM practitioners as \u0093human resources\u0094 to expand the PHC effort. Pha se 1 of a WHO/UNDP project for the development of TRM was undertaken between 1985 and 1988. Thi s project emphasised human resource development and focussed on developin g the teaching skills of 8 instructors of TRM, and the ability of over 1000 practitioners to provi de community advice on the preventive and promotive aspects of PHC and treating common ailm ents (WHO, 2001b:140). Details on phase 2 of this project, or any outcomes and evaluat ions, are not available. The same project provided incentives to establish the National Ins titute of Traditional Medicine, which carries out educational and training programmes for traditional and Ayurvedic practitioners, school children, and the general public. The In stitute does not offer opportunities for advanced training or postgraduate educatio n, so in 1993 the Department of Ayurveda began to provide alternative resources for Ayurvedic Medical O fficers to obtain postgraduate qualifications through the Institute of Indigenous Medi cine at the University of Colombo, Rajagiriya (WHO, 2001b:140). The WHO has been involved in minor programmes, such as assisting with the training of TRM practitioners in biomedical anatomy and basic technology in diagn osing diseases (MIM, 2001:13). As can be seen from these examples, the emphasis of the WHO has been on manpower training and education and not on service delivery or polic y development. In addition, the training has taken the form of basic biomedical theory be ing taught to TRM practitioners, rather than a collaborative cross sector educati on or transfer of information. Recently the WHO was approached by the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine seeking assistance to draft the national policy and translate it i nto Sinhala (Karunasena, interview, 25/10/2004). 264While it is difficult to locate information on WHO activities in the s phere of TRM in Sri Lanka, budget allocations in 1998 provide an indication of emphasis withi n the organisation. While the entire annual allocation for TRM totalled US$37 000, th is was about half the amount allocated to the programme on essential drugs (US$70 000) and s imilar to the proportion given to the promotion of a healthy lifestyle (US$32 000). Howe ver, this information was not provided in WHO documents but in the Action Plan for the Development of the Health Sector by the Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Health which listed foreign aided projects (1998:92). It is not clear how the fund s were spent, again reflecting a lack of transparent and consistent record of data on the T RM sector as well as the fragmentation between agencies and bodies with an interest in o r responsibility for traditional medicine. In terms of the WHO, it is apparent that while there was a strongly a rticulated global policy promoting the use of TRM at headquarters, on the national level the re was only a vague and incoherent strategy. In contrast, biomedicine was clearly dominan t in policy formulation and programme implementation, and little co-ordination or co-ope ration between the sectors had been developed or promoted by the WHO. TRM had a minimal status a nd was not included in mainstream programme activity in any form. Unfortunately , it appeared that the directives of headquarters and resolutions of the World Health Assembly i n relation to TRM were not practically adhered to on the national level by the WHO in Sri Lanka an d were effectively ignored or overlooked. 7.3 World Bank activities As happened on the global level, the World Bank took the lead in policy and pr ogramme development in the sphere of TRM and became actively involved in proje ct development in Sri Lanka. Whereas the WHO barely showed any formal recognition of the sector beyond some piecemeal small scale training on national levels, the World Ba nk invested millions of dollars in development of the sector. It filled the vacuum left by the W HO and focussed on Sri Lanka as offering a potentially lucrative commercial opportu nity. The impetus for this was not for health service delivery but for a comb ination of economic and environmental reasons. Reflecting the broader mandate of the Wor ld Bank, the rapid international market growth for herbal health care products in the 1990s created an opportunity for commercial development that it quickly attempt ed to capitalise on. The global commodification of herbal medicines had created a massive dem and that had not been 265met, and was projected to increase. The Convention on Biological Divers ity (CBD) had been signed in 1992, establishing an atmosphere of heightened sensitivity to environmental issues while \u0093sustainable development\u0094 was the new economic agenda. In 1997, at the peak of the World Bank interest in the medicinal plant a nd herb market and when it recognised that the use of indigenous knowledge could play a pivotal role i n economic development (Lambert, Srivastava, & Vietmeyer, 1997; Sri vastava, Lambert, & Vietmeyer, 1996), it announced a project in Sri Lanka called the \u0093Cons ervation and Sustainable Development of Medicinal Plants\u0094. This five year pr oject was allocated US$4.57 million with the aim of developing a programme that preserved and cu ltivated specific medicinal plants. This project neatly tied in with the international objectives current at the time of sustainable development, environmental preservation and protection of biodiversity . Therefore, it can be argued that these problem streams on the international agenda enabled such a project to gain legitimacy on the national agenda of Sri Lanka. This was a for tuitous coincidence for the TRM sector and allowed an unprecedented provision of secondary resources (both status/prestige and economic benefits). The window of oppor tunity had opened, and the process streams ( problems , politics and policies ) merged to allow the project to gain political prominence and economic support on the national agenda. The problems were developing sustainable industries, preserving the environment and protecting bi odiversity \u0096 and the solution ( policy ) was the project for the development of sustainable use of medicinal pla nts. This simultaneously addressed several pressing problems and provi ded a solution that conveniently garnered support from a variety of interests who had dive rse objectives. This project provides an interesting example of some of the pract ical difficulties in implementing such a programme as well as priorities on the agenda. It was primarily considered an environmental and poverty alleviation project, not a heal th services development scheme. At the time of approval, the World Bank gave \u0093pri ority to promoting the \u0091western model\u0092 of health care\u0094 (World Bank, 2004:2) and emphas ised the environmental and income generating potential of the scheme. While dependency on TRM for health care (especially amongst the poor and rural populations) was recognised, the objectives of the project were not related to access to health services. Instead , the objective was couched in purely developmental and environmental terms \u0096 protection of nat ural resources and generation of income (World Bank, 2004:2-3). 266The presentation of the issue as an environmental and agricultural one was politically expedient for both the World Bank and the government of Sri Lanka. A fo cus on this perspective allowed the funds to be accessed from the recently crea ted GEF (Global Environment Facility, of which the World Bank was an implement ing agency) and also avoided contentious and complex issues related to the health syst em structure and development of the TRM sector. It seemed incidental that these pla nts were used for health care \u0096 the outcomes of the project were presented as exclusively envi ronmentally or developmentally related.113 The fact that they were part of the TRM system only increased their economic value. Medicinal plants were basically a cash crop, bu t one that needed to be managed sensitively for environmental reasons. This correlated wi th the economic rationalist trend in health policy the World Bank had promoted in 1993 with the report Investing in Health (World Bank, 1993). Despite the World Bank changing directions in the 1990s and embracing the conce pt of a \u0093human face of development\u0094 (which emphasised issues such a s the environment, health and education as keys to future economic growth), the Conservation and Sustainable Development of Medicinal Plants project seemed to remain purely e conomic rationalist in tone and content. For example, the links between health and developme nt were not directly referred to, even in this project which had a clear health compo nent. The jargon of the World Bank in the 1990s did not appear to match the practical activities, which enabled it to avoid complex social and political problems in borrowing countries. The GEF and World Bank priorities were evident in the scope and language of the project, whi ch concentrated exclusively on easily measurable economic objectives guided by e nvironmental conservation. The medicinal plants project also illustrated a problem previo usly mentioned in relation to policy transfer from the international to national levels. While an international consensus had been agreed in relation to the environment, this did not always match the agenda on national levels. Just as the global PHC and integration of TRM policies suffered in implementation when national level priorities diverged, the project on medicinal pla nts demonstrated that international agencies and national governments may not have co rresponding concerns. This point was raised in the project evaluation \u0096 despite a strong internati onal consensus on the 113 For example, in the project description provided by the World Bank public information centre, benefits were listed for the global, national and local levels. At the g lobal level, this included conservation of medicinal plants and preservation of unique ecosystems and knowledge on cul tivation and use. At the national level benefits we re improved supply of medicinal plants, market analysi s to improve efficient production and distribution and sustainable use of resources. At the local level, increased choi ces of livelihood and opportunities, income generati on, employment, equitable sharing of natural resources a nd resource management were listed. Health care did not feature directly in any of the outcomes or benefits. 267environmental agenda \u0093the national development agenda and institution al structures may not have been fully prepared to absorb such initiatives\u0094 (World Ba nk, 2004:18). Agendas are not always synchronised. Problems identified and their solutions may not be the same for international and national bodies, or proposed solutions may not hav e the institutional and administrative capacity to implement (e.g. legal and regulat ory frameworks). While the World Bank and other institutions such as IUCN may have been eager, political and economic realities in Sri Lanka presented a stumbling block to sm ooth implementation of the project. Factors impeding the project included: political vola tility (which led to ministerial changes as well as changes in the senior administration of the responsible government unit); the lack of a legislative framework for the protection of intellectual property in relation to TRM; and administrative and institution al weaknesses. This meant the international \u0093issues and agenda for action were not totally in ph ase with the institutional capacity\u0094 (World Bank, 2004:12). The divergence between global and local priorities and the probl ems mentioned above meant that external bodies took a disproportionate control over the project an d national government determination and ownership of the project was diminished (World Bank, 2004: 12) and the project appeared driven by external interests: The high degree of international advocacy of biodiversi ty conservation in the \u0093global interest\u0094 also fuelled national public debate over the p rospects of the loss of national control over indigenous knowledge and bio-resources. The impact of this was to further reduce the perception of national ownership and national interest in the pr oject (World Bank, 2004:12). While the large provision of funds was significant, it was not direct ed to improving service delivery or alleviating the fragmentary nature of Ayurvedic insti tutional infrastructure and training, and the project was not clearly defined as a TRM or a health project as such. Initially (as hinted at above) it was not even welcomed in the sector or by target communities who instead considered it a neo-colonial attempt to steal indigenous pl ant knowledge (D. Perera, interview, 1/4/03). This was compounded by the lack of clear regulatory mechanisms which safeguarded intellectual property, and identified the bene ficiaries of any commercial application or use of such knowledge. Therefore, the project further demonstrated that external age ndas or priorities which are agreed at the global level by funding or advisory bodies can be difficult to implement on national levels (as also illustrated in the PHC case and the WHO). T his project was both a practical example of the World Bank taking a strategic lead in p olicy development in TRM, 268and reflects some of the barriers to implementation experienc ed with international priorities in national settings. For example, the implementation of the pr oject preceded the necessary national regulatory frameworks. Therefore, on national levels, th e institutional capacity and legal frameworks to implement internationally endorsed progra mmes may be lacking or inadequately established. Political volatility and other factors impeded the development of essential legislation in this case, which the World Bank had mistakenly assumed would be address ed in a timely manner. This may have been a result of underestimating the contenti ous yet subtle political position of TRM in the health care sector, and inadequately assess ing the historical administration of indigenous medicine. In addition, issues surrounding the professional status of practitioners and the development of the sector may have bee n insufficiently canvassed. An exclusive focus on economic and environmental factors a nd a lack of assessment of social and political issues, may have given an unreal istic impression of the ease of implementation and achievable outcomes of the project. 7.4 Professional interaction Despite the international growth of demand for TRM products and services and the heavy reliance nationally on this sector for health care, Ranaweera wh en Secretary of the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine considered that at best the current relati onship between biomedicine and indigenous medicine was an \u0093 uneasy truce \u0094 (Ranaweera, 2001:13, Ranaweera, undated:11, emphasis added). In contrast to Waxler (1984; 1988), who concluded that the division of labour between biomedical and TRM sectors involved litt le conflict, it was eloquently described by Dr. Ranasinghe (an Ayurvedic practitioner) as a battlefield: Today Ayurveda having acquired most of the valuable techniques of the age-old traditional systems faces boldly the modern, so called scie ntific medicine for its last battle. There was a time for Ayurveda, we may say, its golden era when no other system of healing posed a threat to its existence, much less to its principl es. That period has receded to the past never to return. Ayurveda having rejuvenated during the period of re naissance tries to recover the ground it had lost. Nevertheless [biomedicin e] not only does not yield an inch of its acquired territory but engages in its normal advance h urling ever increasingly its new armoury in the face of Ayurveda. Thus an ideological confrontation has set in . A confrontation that was raging ever since Ayurveda recovered fro m its hibernation (Ranasinghe, 1987:115, emphasis added). The conflict between the sectors is therefore more subtle than that visible at practitioner level, and can be more clearly discerned at research, education, a nd policy and/or programme development areas. Competition, jealousy, and tensio n are recognised between practitioners (Somaratne, interview, 30/11/04) and a lack of co-operati on is evident 269(Goonerwardene, interview, 15/12/04). Whereas on the surface the medica l systems may appear to function and interact in harmony, the parallel system o perates on a historical base of mutual distrust and rivalry (Aluwihare, 1986). This becomes c learer when the current professional interaction between biomedical and Ayurved ic sectors is considered more closely. The power imbalance evident between biomedicine and Ayurveda reflec ts the colonial origins of biomedicine, which continues to overshadow the relatio nship 14/12/04). \u0093The attitude which glorified western medicine almost to the exclusion of other medicines persists to a large extent today ... It\u0092s going t o be a hard grind to turn it around\u0094 (Goonewardene, 2004). The relationship between these sectors is discussed in more detail below, with a section on each system to elaborate on profes sional attitudes and interaction. 7.4.1 Biomedical profession As in other countries, the biomedical profession is strongly organis ed and enjoys a high social and economic status. A thorough background and history of the biome dical profession in Sri Lanka is provided by Pieris (2001). Her study commences with the introduction of biomedicine in Sri Lanka and the subsequent professional development of practitioners. The Sri Lankan Medical Association (SLMA) is the professional represe ntative body, which was originally a branch of the British Medical Association. It has ope rated for 117 years and currently has around 2000 members (Epa, interview, 5/12/04). 7.4.1:1 Relations with Ayurveda According to Ranaweera (2001:13), the lack of understanding and respe ct between the systems is exemplified by the Sri Lankan Medical Council (SLMC) , a body responsible for the registration and professional conduct/discipline of biomedical doctors. In the early 1990s, the SLMC passed a resolution which prohibited biomedical doctors fr om practising other systems of medicine or healing modalities, or collaboratin g with such practitioners, under the 270threat of de-registration. While this has never been enfor ced (Panditharatne, interview, 20/12/04), it acts as a powerful symbolic deterrent.114 This resolution has never been imposed according to the SLMC as it first requires a complaint by a member of the public against the biomedical professional concerned. The fact that no member of the public has ever complained, and the resoluti on was not initially instigated due to public complaint, indicates that the issue of professional interaction is more a professional concern of the biomedical group, rather than one re lated to public safety or quality of care. It mainly acts as a formal barrier to collabor ation, and a strong commitment to the principle of non-integration drives the continued adheren ce to this regulation. It is an adamant position of the SLMC that there is no mixing between medic al systems in any form and that a parallel and not integrated system operates (Pandi tharatne, interview, 20/12/04). The current registrar of the SLMC argues that biomedical practiti oners should not practice Ayurveda and Ayurvedic practitioners should not practice biomedicine, a s any type of integration will inevitably lead to the death of one system. In this case, TRM is presumed to be vulnerable to demise as the superiority of biomedicine will be dem onstrated in treatment. Therefore the measure is promoted as protective of indigenous forms o f medicine (Panditharatne, interview, 20/12/04). Regardless of government polic y on integration, professional associations or representative bodies have therefore e xerted a str ong influence on the implementation of this goal through enacting misconduct rul es that bar integration in a practical sense. Another practical barrier to integration is in place at the level o f practitioner education. In addition to barring biomedical doctors from practising Ayurveda or c ollaborating with these doctors, they are also prevented from teaching any biomedical subject s at Ayurvedic tertiary institutions. Therefore, while Ayurvedic students desire to learn bi omedical subjects such as anatomy and physiology, they are not allowed to be taught by a register ed biomedical practitioner. There is very strong hostility within the biomedical profession to including any biomedical subjects in the Ayurvedic curriculum (Kasturaratchi, in terview 1/12/04). This necessitates recourse to biomedical doctors who are not registered w ith the SLMC and who 114 Some people referred to the famous case of Dr. Jay asuriya as a practical outcome of this prohibition. He was a well known biomedical doctor who was de-registered by the SLMC in 2001. It is suspected (and reported) that his popular acupuncture practise was the reason for thi s, although the official reason was that he failed to respond to SLMC correspondence or provide a current residential address thus breaching professional misconduct rule s (Panditharatne, interview, 20/12/04; Jayasuriya, 7/12/04). Dr Jayasuriya ran an acupuncture cl inic in a government biomedical hospital until his death in 20 05. He was also a very strong and outspoken proponen t of integrated medicine, at the practitioner level. It i s interesting to note his acupuncture students have adopted some biomedical primary resources, such as white coats an d stethoscopes \u0096 a practice noted by biomedical pra ctitioners (Goonewardene, interview, 15/12/04). 271have trained as teachers overseas in India, China or the former USSR (S omaratne, interview, 30/11/04). In contrast to the desire of Ayurvedic students to learn biomedical subj ects, there is not great enthusiasm amongst biomedical students to learn Ayurveda. Recent ly, this option has been included in biomedical curriculum, but is not compulsory. The most popular subject is panca karma , practical physical therapies (Somaratne, interview, 30/11/04). T here seems to be little genuine interest in learning about Ayurveda, except as a \u0093cu riosity\u0094 similar to a museum relic, and to enable them to discredit it. It provides them with s ufficient knowledge of Ayurveda to give them the \u0093weapons\u0094 to later destroy it (Kasturaratchi , interview 1/12/04). Again, this ban on teaching is a powerful symbolic statement that rei nforces the boundaries between the professions. \u0093The battleground for integration of medic ines is in the training of students\u0094 (Goonewardene, 2004). Some believe the real fear of the SLMC is that Ayurvedic graduates will use their biomedical knowledge (Jayansinghe, interview , 20/12/04; D. Perera, interview, 01/04/03), thus presenting an economic threat to biomedical doc tors (C. Fonseka, interview, 15/12/04; Somaratne, interview, 30/11/04). There is an underlyi ng concern that Ayurvedic doctors will prescribe biomedical drugs (use biomedical pri mary resources, therefore obtaining secondary resources) (Panditharatne, inte rview, 20/12/04; Kasturaratchi, interview, 1/12/04). The actions by the SLMC to prevent or deter biomedical doctors fro m sharing primary resources (knowledge, facilities) is therefore clearly linked to preserving existing secondary resources (economic benefits, status, prestige). Such responses by the SLMC are a formalised outcome of professional resistance to the concept of integration, and are methods to control, restrict and re-define the process of integration. Sta unch opposition to integration exists amongst the biomedical fraternity (Epa, interview, 5/12/04). As integration provides secondary resources (status, prestige, economic benefits), this re luctance is not unexpected and has also been demonstrated elsewhere (as mentioned in previous chapters). A final example of biomedical aversion to the concept of integra tion and sharing primary resources (facilities, techniques, knowledge) relates to hospital facilities. It can be assumed that the proposed initiative of an Ayurvedic ward in every hospital (that did not eventuate) would have met with opposition. Around the same time, an assess ment of hospital facilities revealed that some were underutilised. In an effort to rationalis e resources, it was suggested that a biomedical hospital could be transferred to the Government Ayur vedic sector. 272However, this idea did not meet with approval of the biomedical professi on (Epa, interview, 5/12/04). These are all examples of the biomedical profession protecting prim ary resources with the intent of preserving secondary resources. According to C. Fonseka, they are reflective of a broader class struggle (interview, 15/12/04). While Ayurveda engages i n a struggle to seek greater status and resources, biomedicine actively resists such ef forts. Dr Epa proposes the struggle is more over status than economic benefits (interview, 5/12/04), but it is recognised by many that there is a reluctance to share secondary resources whet her of the tangible or intangible variety (Wijesekera, interview, 31/3/2003; Goonerwardene, . Dr. C. Fonseka believes that the biomedical profession will continue to exert professiona l leverage to prevent integration unless there is strong political pressure. He anticipate s that the SLMC may make some concessions because of the rapidly increasing power of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Party which has a policy of improving health care services an d promoting Ayurveda. 7.4.1:2 Professional recognition The resistance of the biomedical profession to practical integr ation is further exemplified by the fact that no official links or formal relationships exist be tween the SLMC and any organisations that represent Ayurveda or other systems of medici ne. The objective of the SLMC is to prevent association of any type \u0096 administratively, prof essionally, or in education and training. This barrier to professional recognition of TRM extends to the Ceylon Medical Journal , which had few references to Ayurveda or other forms of indigenous medicine. In approximately 15 years of publication, only sever al passing references were made to Ayurveda and it would be natural to conc lude from this publication that no system of medicine other than biomedicine exists in Sri Lanka. One comment made clearly illustrates the status of Ayurveda in r elation to biomedicine. A doctor wrote about his biomedical education and on being discovere d reading a specialised section of a biomedical textbook by a lecturer who was a senior surgeon: he said that I have read the most irrelevant section in the book, and added that since I am only interested in rare things, I should read on indigen ous medicine, meet all the veda mahattayas [Ayurvedic doctors] in the area, and present in class wha t I had found (Bulugahapitiya, 2002:136). 273This anecdote reflects the sentiment prevailing at the time, base d on modernisation and development discourses \u0096 TRM and Ayurveda were outmoded relics o f an uncivilised era and practitioners were objects of curiosity rather than respe ct. In this journal, as was the case with Government and WHO documents, overviews and commentary on the hea lth system exclusively focused on biomedicine.115 However, one article did acknowledge the importance of Ayurveda whilst not including it in the health sector ana lysis: I have left out much that is important in health care in o ur country. Ayurvedic and other indigenous forms of medicine enjoy an important place in ou r health care system but constraints of time available and my unfamiliarity with t his subject prevents me from including these (De Silva, 1990:100-101). Any references to Ayurveda or TRM in the Ceylon Medical Journal were scarce and incidental, which also describes biomedical referral patterns t o TRM. None of the biomedical doctors interviewed acknowledged referring patients to A yurvedic practitioners. Some acknowledged that referrals did occur, but very rarely and usua lly in response to a direct patient request (Epa, interview 5/12/04) or to a specific doct or for psychosomatic complaints (Weerasekera, interview, 7/12/04). It is extremely un common for a biomedical doctor to prescribe Ayurvedic drugs, except perhaps to recommend to t he use of some balms or oils (Jayansinghe, interview, 20/12/04). The irony of this situation was noted by several interviewees, co nsidering that biomedical practitioners may personally use Ayurvedic (Wijesekera, 17/12/04). While professionally they may ignore or disparage Ayurvedi c drugs, personally they may resort to them, or have relatives who are TRM practitione rs. There appears to be no conflict in this approach of personal use/professional criticism, a gain reflecting Ayurveda as an inherent part of the culture even if professional training and riva lry later excludes their serious consideration for use as practitioners. Despite this professional blindness to Ayurveda, the biomedical professi on has recently begun to more critically examine their model of health, and beco me more receptive to other modes of healing and broader determinants of health. This reflects international trends in the 1990s to realign biomedical conceptual paradigms. For example, the Sr i Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) annual conference in 2003 was on Spiritual Health \u0096 A New Dimension 115 Pieris noted that the local folk healers did not p ose a threat to biomedicine and therefore attracted no comment at all in medical journals. However, Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Desiya Chikitsa did have their own theorie s of disease and prescriptions for healing and therefore provided competition (Pieris, 2001:75). 274in Health . This radical departure from strictly biomedical parameters wa s in response to a growing body of evidence linking emotional and spiritual factors t o health status. Epa, the then President of the SLMA, gave a paper at the conference on mind-body i nteraction, which he acknowledged was an \u0093unusual topic for a scientific forum\u0094. An a rticle on the same theme was also published in the Ceylon Medical Journal (Epa, 2003) and the development was reported in newspapers (Karunaratne, 2003; Malawaraarchchi , 2003). While the SLMA Conference may have broken new ground in discussing e motional and spiritual aspects of health, it did not go as far as recognising thi s as an inherent aspect of indigenous systems of medicine (TRM). While religious activity an d rituals, and meditation were mentioned, the fact that these are often components of indigenous S ri Lankan healing systems was not. Some questions from the floor addressed this anom aly \u0096 why had mind- body interactions only recently been discovered and acknowledged by biomedic ine when it has been an important part of Sri Lankan culture for decades? Why are indigenous models of health which incorporate a mind, body, spirit connection (such as Ayur veda) overlooked? Unfortunately, these questions were not fully discussed by the pa nel apart from mentioning that the biomedical mode of education has previously precluded such a n understanding developing. Maybe a good place to start would be right here at home with the Easte rn philosophy that [linked mind, body, spirituality] several thousand years ago. Can w e overcome our need to get the answer from a Western, \u0093modern\u0094 source? How high has the killing rate got to get before we shed our colonial awe of the \u0093white man\u0094 as the font of all wisdom and technological advance? (Karunaratne, 2 003). The reason for this lack of direct acknowledgment of Ayurveda or othe r forms of TRM appears to be the extreme nature of the departure from the biomedical m odel and the necessity to abandon long held and deep seated beliefs about the infer iority of such medical systems entrenched during colonisation (Jayasinghe, interview , 20/12/04). Openly acknowledging the advantages of Ayurveda or TRM is a drastic move fr om formally ignoring or suppressing it and also gives secondary resources (stat us, prestige) to their professional competitor. Once the mind-body link is well establi shed in the biomedical field, the biomedical profession may be more receptive to exploring indigenous traditions that exist locally (Epa, interview, 5/12/04). However, wide professional acceptance of the mind- body link is a pre-requisite, from which greater biomedical inter est in Ayurveda may develop in the coming years. Growing interest in the West in Ayurved a (enhancing its status, secondary resources) may gradually increase biomedical support an d respect for it domestically (Epa, interview, 5/12/04; Goonerwardene, interview, 15/12/04). 275Generally, it appears that any increased support and interest in A yurveda due to foreign demand is from the government rather than from biomedical practitioners (Epa, interview 5/12/04; Somaratne, interview, 30/11/04). It may be that secondary resour ces generated by Ayurveda are not significant enough to stimulate biomedical intere st in their primary resources, or that this recognition is taking some time to filter th rough and accommodate professionally. There is also little government support and lack of research to scientifically validate the benefits and validity of TRM (Goonerwardene, intervi ew, 15/12/04). TRM mainly serves the poor and rural populations and foreign deman d for TRM is still minimal \u0096 meanwhile, domestic health service provision is still overw helmingly biomedical. So while a small niche tourist market has recently develop ed, income and benefits from this are not yet significant enough to encourage biomedical professiona l interest (Kasturaratchi, interview 1/12/04). Biomedicine retains structural control, and s ignificant status and economic benefits from the current organisational domination of the fo rmal health sphere. 7.4.2 Ayurvedic profession The Ayurvedic profession in Sri Lanka has an ambiguous position. Whi le Ayurveda enjoys the honour and respect of being part of the valued heritage of the country, i t is also considered an anachronism in some senses and often a \u0093seco nd choice\u0094 as a profession to biomedicine (Jayawardhana, interview, 17/12/04) because the privileges a nd status of biomedical practice (secondary resources) are greater than those a vailable in the Ayurvedic sphere (Jayasinghe, interview, 20/12/04). The history of relations betwe en Ayurveda and biomedicine has been one of an ongoing struggle by the Ayurvedic sector to pl ace it firmly alongside biomedicine and obtain the same status and benefits as the biomedical profession. The complex historical relations and active competition between t hese sectors is detailed by Pieris (2001), who describes the sustained efforts by Ayurveda to eleva te its status and the poor professional image of practitioners (2001:79-98). 7.4.2:1 Professionalisation & scientific discourse One explanation for the low official status of the Ayurvedic professi on may be the lack of organisation and discipline within it (Pieris, 2001:84). The het erogenous nature of the group prevented an easy professional formalisation. As early as 1947 a nd at the time of independence, the Commission of Inquiry into Indigenous Medicine recommended t he organisation of the Ayurvedic sector along lines that resembled the bi omedical sector and 276found formal education of poor quality with the profession \u0093despised\u0094 a nd ridiculed. It suggested the formation of professional associations and publicati on of journals to improve the status of the profession (Pieris, 2001:87). Following independence the greatest opposition to tradi tional medicine came from the western educated medical men of Sri Lanka. The commonest a llegation was that traditional systems of medicine were unscientific, based on assumptions ... Counter arguments of the followers of traditional medicine were ineffective due to the power and influence the western educated possessed at that time (Edirisinghe, 1987:167). However, the formal professional status of Ayurveda changed when (as pro posed by Unschuld), the process of professionalisation in order to secure re sources gathered pace in the TRM sector in 2003. Professional activity prior to this had also o ccurred, for example with the publication of journals, institutionalisation of educati on and delivery of services, registration of practitioners and development of professional conduc t rules. However, Ayurvedic doctors formed a professional association in 2003 to strengthe n their lobbying ability with the Government and enhance their professional str ength. While the biomedical profession formed such an association over one h undred years ago, the Ayurvedic sector lagged considerably behind it and only formed a corre sponding body in 2003. The Sri Lankan Ayurvedic Medical Association aims to enhance d ialogue with government and biomedical bodies (D. Perera, interview, 1/4/03) and me t with its biomedical counterpart (the SLMC) for the first time in 2004. It was agreed at that meeting to form a joint committee to review the causes of the poor relations between the sectors and how to improve them (D. Perera, interview, 19/12/04). Further evidence of professionalisation beyond the formation of a representative body is the establishment of a group to promote the interests of the TRM sector. An alliance was formed in 2004 called the Action Committee for Ayurvedic and Indigenous Medical Ed ucation and Professional Development. The main impetus for this allianc e was to protest against a government ordinance which meant as a profession, they were isola ted, discriminated against and neglected (D. Perera, interview, 9/12/04). Membership is a broad spectrum of various professional bodies and associations, forming a coalition of about 8 or ganisations.116 116 Members of the Alliance include the Alumina Associ ation of the Institute of Indigenous Colombo; Alumina Association of Ayurveda Ayurveda Medical Off icers\u0092 Association; Indigenous Medical Practitioners\u0092 Association; Indigenous Medical Association. 277The most contentious regulation that the Action Committee is prot esting is Medical Ordinance (chapter 105, number 34) which states that: In any written law, whether passed or made before or after t he commencement of this Ordinance, the words \u0091legally qualified medical practiti oner\u0092 or \u0091duly qualified medical practitioner\u0092 or \u0091registered medical practitioner\u0092 or a ny words importing a person recognized by law as a practitioner in medicine or surgery shall be con strued as meaning a medical practitioner registered under this Ordinance. The outcome of this ordinance is that Ayurvedic doctors are not legall y recognised as medical practitioners, and that this status is reserved for biomed ical doctors only. Therefore, the alliance was formed to secure secondary resources includi ng the status of formal recognition as medical practitioners (Jayawardhana, interview, 17/12/04) allowing them to have the same responsibilities as biomedical doctors includi ng issuing medical certificates (D. Perera, interview, 9/12/04). The alliance is also protesting against a monopolistic heal th system which it argues is the result of a colonial heritage and is now a neo-colonial outcome of globali sation. In 2004, this newly formed alliance launched a massive publicity campaign invol ving the distribution of thousands of protest posters. These posters argued that Sri Lanka ha d a variety of medical systems in the health sector, and that the pluralistic system sh ould be adequately recognised in official health care policy as well as with modification to col onial health legislation. They were placed in prominent locations throughout Colombo, including in front o f the Health Ministry (which is biomedical in orientation and composition). The entrenched structural control of biomedicine in the formal health care system has given the previously loosely associated bodies a common goal and allowed t hem to unite in order to secure more government funding and recognition (secondary resources) . The formation of the professional association and an alliance are significant political steps and an essential requirement to securing status in negotiations over resources. The c olonial legacy which enabled biomedicine to secure domination of the health ca re system and degraded the status of indigenous medical systems is considered a form of colonisation of t he mind (Fanon, 1978), which is extremely difficult to overcome and enables asymme tric power relations to be maintained. The consciousness that biomedicine is inherently superior, and a symbol of progress and modernisation is pervasive and ingrained (but also re sisted): The White Male has trained and indoctrinated their acolyt es in our countries, the doctors, to brand our own medical system as primitive and quackery Thus our nat ives lose all their sense of self-respect and their own potential creativity a s our people. They lose their very soul and become mere puppets of their colonial masters [We ] do not know that instead of being apes of the White Man, our tradition has the potenti ality to teach the white male who is digging his own grave in the name of western medicine (Dharmasiri, 1997: 162). 278 Biomedical domination is embedded in regulatory and administr ative structures. The biomedical sector always assumes control or oversight of the TRM se ctor, as well as almost total allocation of resources. For example, some key administra tive positions in Ayurvedic institutions are filled by biomedical doctors \u0096 such as the head of t he Institute of Indigenous Medicine at Colombo University. There is currently a proposal made by the Ayurvedic sector for the Ayurvedic Research Institute and National Institu te of Traditional Medicine (which are both primarily research and education organisations) t o become independent statutory bodies (D. Perera, interview, 01/04/03). Independence from biom edical control in administrative and legal arrangements is crucial to the TRM sec tor in asserting professional power and status as a medical system in its own right and with equ itable weight in health sector development. The Ayurvedic sector is aware that it is not respected by the biomed ical profession because it is \u0093unscientific\u0094 (Amarasinghe, interview, 19/11/04; Malimage, int erview, 25/10/04), despite having scientific research bodies undertaking development of the sect or. The research bodies (Ayurvedic Research Institute, and the National Institute of Tra ditional Medicine) have the objective of scientifically testing and developing Ayurvedic products, but the research output has been sporadic and piecemeal. For example, there has been no orga nised plan or research policy regarding priority areas (Edirisinghe, 1987:168). Organised culti vation and propagation of medicinal plants and herbs to prevent wild stocks b eing over harvested has been on a small and limited scale (Schokman, 2004). The research bodie s may have been restricted in operation by a lack of adequate resources, expe rtise, co-ordination with other research bodies, the professional biomedical restrictions on collabor ation and education of Ayurvedic practitioners, and low political commitment. The re appears to be more status, prestige and economic benefits for scientists to work in the biomedic al or technology sector. It is ironic that the scientific development of Ayurveda in term s of an evidence base has been hindered by the restrictions placed on the training of practitioner s (mentioned above). This means that skills and knowledge such as scientific methods are not ta ught comprehensively in Ayurvedic tertiary institutions and there is a lack of qualifie d staff with both a scientific and Ayurvedic knowledge base. This restriction is partly due to the fear o f the biomedical profession that Ayurvedic doctors actually have a \u0093fundamental desire \u0094 to be biomedical practitioners, and that those who fail to qualify for biomedical training instead undertake Ayurvedic education (Pandutharatne, interview, 20/12/04; D. Perera i nterview, 3/12/04). 279Therefore, the desire to learn biomedical and scientific subject s is perceived as a technique to become quasi-biomedical practitioners that is market driven (Ka sturaratchi, interview 1/12/04). The adoption of biomedical techniques and jargon (primar y resources) by TRM practitioners is viewed as an overt threat. Training in biom edical anatomy and basic technology in diagnosing diseases has proven popular among TRM practitione rs (MIM, 2001:13). One medical anthropologist claims that this extends to Ayurvedi c practitioners \u0093overwhelmingly\u0094 prescribing biomedical drugs (Waxler-Morrison, 1988) . However, most Ayurvedic doctors interviewed state they do not use biomedical pharma ceuticals or refer patients to biomedical services except in emergencies of acute c onditions (Somaratne, 30/11/04, N. Fonseka, interview, 9/12/04; J. Perara, interview, 29/10/04). This is estimated to represent approximately 10-15% of cases (Amarasinghe, interview, 19/ 11/04). The adoption of scientific discourse has therefore been impeded by p rofessional restrictions placed on biomedical practitioners which prevents the teaching of and direct professional collaboration with Ayurvedic practitioners. However, as mentioned previously, rapid market growth now necessitates documentation of safety and efficacy , and has promoted the \u0093scientific\u0094 development of the sector. Adopting scientific jargon and scientifically evaluating remedies and treatments is increasing amongst the Ayurve dic profession. For example, the professional journal Ayurveda Sameekshawa is dominated by clinical studies and scientific assessment of the efficacy of certain remedies for p articular conditions. Another research journal, Ayurveda Pradeepika also clearly reflected the influence of Western scientific method in research designs and terminology (P ieris, 2001:86). As mentioned in the methodology (chapter 2), the adoption of scientifi c discourse and professionalisation to secure legitimacy and power in formal he alth care spheres is a pattern recognised in other TRM/CAM systems including osteopathy (Bae r, 1981; Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:544), homoeopathy (Cant & Sharma, 1995, 1996; Lee, 1982; Taylor, 1979a:83), chiropractic (Coburn & Biggs, 1986), acupuncture (Baer et al., 1998) and naturopathy (Gort & Coburn, 1988). 7.4.2:2 Growth in secondary resources Ayurveda has increased in political and economic status with an inc rease in international interest and therefore foreign income. Increasing government suppor t can be discerned with this rapidly growing market and source of foreign exchange (Jaya singhe, interview 20/12/04; Amarasinghe, interview, 19/11/04; Goonerwardene, interview, 15/12/04). The i nternational 280interest in and demand for Ayurveda became particularly evident from t he mid 1990s, especially from Germany (Somaratne, interview, 30/11/04). This co rrelated with international trends for citizens to seek CAM/TRM as an alter native or adjunct to biomedicine. However, this increased foreign interest has not translated i nto increased professional recognition for Ayurveda within Sri Lanka by biomedical doctors (Somar atne, interview, 30/11/04) and biomedicine still displays a lack of professional respec t for TRM (Chandralatha, interview, 25/03/03). According to biomedical profess ional attitudes, Ayurveda is still a marginal health care system that offers litt le to modern health sector development and is generally formally ignored. As previously men tioned, secondary resources generated by Ayurveda may not yet be significant enough to st imulate biomedical interest in their primary resources, and biomedicine currently e njoys large secondary resources from its organisational domination of the formal health s phere (which has not been effectively threatened by Ayurveda, in terms of diverting secondary resources from biomedicine). Regardless of this lack of secondary resources in the form of loc al professional status or prestige, Ayurveda did manage to secure rapidly increasing economic a llocations domestically and from foreign funding bodies such as the World Bank. The budge tary allocation to indigenous medicine has significantly increased, however the proportion dedicated to Ayurveda is still quite small and the vast amount of hea lth expenditure is absorbed by biomedicine. Despite being a minimal fraction of the tot al health budget the increasing allocation is still a significant milestone and rep resents a rapid and unprecedented accumulation of resources \u0096 government budget allocations nearly tripled between 1998 and 2001. Combined with funding from the GEF/World Bank project on the conse rvation and cultivation of medicinal plants, the TRM sector secured an extrao rdinary financial commitment to the development of the sector and enhanced visib ility, and thus an increase in a range of secondary resources (economic benefits, status, prestige ). The massive growth of secondary resources for the Ayurvedic secto r due to the new Western interest in natural therapies can be illustrated with referenc e to an individual practice (J. Perera, interview, 29/10/04). After graduation, Dr Jaanaki Perara w as a resident Ayurvedic doctor at the Hotel Paragon in Unawatunu catering mainly for for eign tourists. She established her own clinic in the popular resort town of Hikkaduwa in 1999. Dr Perara now operates three clinics there, employing four doctors as well as the rapists and assistants. In 2003 she began expanding her business further along the coastal tourist stri p and now has a 281chain of eight clinics in total. This expansion has been partly funde d by German business partners, and German tourists make up a large proportion of her fore ign clientele. Although she has several clinics in the small coastal town of Hikkadu wa, her business does not have a monopoly on supply of Ayurvedic services. In an approximately 2-3km strip, she estimates there are around fifteen Ayurvedic doctors practising and there are at least half a dozen shop fronts advertising treatments. These clinics compe te to capture the seasonal influx of tourists. At the main clinic in Hikkaduwa, Dr Perera say s she has consultations with 15-20 local people per day and 20-30 tourists during the tourist season. She estimates overall that the number of foreigners treated is double that of locals. The main conditions they sought treatment for are vague chronic categories like low ene rgy, poor immunity and also beauty therapies. Throughout the 1990s Ayurveda was obtaining increasing sec ondary resources from both the private sector and the government. If the value of Ayurvedic primary resources was unrecognised or not per ceived as a credible threat to the status of the biomedical profession in the formal health s ector, it was not being ignored by external interests. Sri Lanka experienced the first recorded case of biopiracy in 1999 (see Samath, 1999b). The export of medicinal plants or their extrac ts is banned in Sri Lanka, however bio-piracy was increasing and the high profile case of a university professor being detained for bio-piracy and charged with smuggling gained much prom inence (Sriyananda, 2004). A lack of adequate intellectual property law and fra meworks for the protection of indigenous knowledge, as well as insufficient inventories o f rare medicinal plants (Kumar, 2000b; Samath, 1999a; Schokman, 2004; Sriyananda, 2004) of TRM primary resources by foreign pharmaceuti cal (scientific and biomedical) interests: Loopholes in existing laws and other legal snags are robbi ng the country of millions of dollars that is rightfully ours since the country does not have the hi-tech scientific equipment to analyze chemical components of indigenous pla nts or the capacity to pay the international patent fee of $60,000, wealthy countries are taking a dvantage (Samath quoting Sirimal Premakumara, a scientist at the Ceylon Institute o f Scientific and Industrial Research) (Samath, 1999a)117 The rapid growth in secondary resources, mainly spurred by foreign in terest in TRM, therefore fuelled the professional development and political levera ge of Ayurveda in Sri 117 \u0093Many other patents, like from the plant Weniwalgeta - used effectively as a herbal remedy for fever, co ughs and colds - have been registered by Japanese, European and U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers although th e law requires that a patent can be obtained only if it is an economically valuable invention created through a methodology, most multinationals have somehow obtaine d patents for products used in our country for thous ands of years.\u0094 (Samath, 1999a) 282Lanka. Legislative frameworks to protect intellectual property, a national policy on indigenous medicine and updated regulations were all required to acc ommodate the sudden market growth. The catalyst of environmental conservation and p reservation of biodiversity also enhanced the role of TRM on the policy agenda, and around the turn of the century it had achieved unprecedented secondary resources. Concurrent with t his growth in secondary resources was an increase in professional activity and adoption of scientific discourse. 7.5 Conclusion The policy developments in Sri Lanka regarding the integration of TRM have mirrored broader global trends and patterns. This is evident historicall y and in contemporary developments \u0096 from the suppression and exclusion of indigenous medicine in the colonial era, the adoption and promotion of biomedicine as a modernising agent, to the re-emergence of TRM as an expression of cultural heritage with independence, the comm ercialisation of the TRM sector during 1990s, and the increasing pressure to address polic y and regulatory aspects to meet market growth from mid-late 1990s. While TRM is officially sanctioned and promoted as part of government he alth policy and is functionally strong, it has been formally marginalised and dom inated by biomedicine which still secures structural control in Sri Lankan health care s ystem and policy development. Formal recognition of TRM has not translated into power or status in t he formal health services sphere, or an equitable distribution of resources or repres entation in health policy. The country case study has demonstrated in more detail the ope ration of the analytical framework on a national level. The hypotheses put forward by Kingdon (1984), U nschuld (1975; 1976b), and Lee (1982) can be seen to be operating in the policy domain of indigenous medicine in Sri Lanka. The policy notion of integrati on floated around on the domestic political agenda for several decades and gained some adva nces at politically opportune moments \u0096 when the politics or problem streams were conducive to pushing it onto the agenda. This is most evident at independence and in the 1990s whe n a foreign market developed for TRM therapies and remedies. However, as Unschuld proposed, medical systems usually do not co-op erate voluntarily to share resources (Unschuld, 1976b:8). In this case, interest group int eraction may have impeded the agreed government goal of integrating indigenous medic ine into the formal health care system. While a type of parallel system has been es tablished and operates 283effectively, it is a hierarchical system which reflects asy mmetric power relations. This power imbalance was established during colonisation and persists to th is day, reflected in the distorted and subordinated development of the indigenous medical sect or which is dominated administratively, structurally, politically and economically by the biomedical field. Power and political manoeuvring is exerted in health policy formu lation, service infrastructure and in education and training, by professional orga nisations in the competition to secure or maintain resources. The biomedical profession has i mplemented barriers to integration and co-operation at practitioner level through res trictions on practice and education. These professional restrictions impede practical integration despite political recognition of Ayurveda and state expressions of support. The \u0093unscien tific\u0094 nature of Ayurveda is one factor in the biomedical professional rejection and exc lusion of it from health services development, and competition appears to be another. However, the biomedical profession also recently began to modify conceptual par adigms to incorporate spiritual and psychological dimensions of health (an implicit recognition o f primary resources of TRM). The Ayurvedic profession formed a representative professional body in 2003 and has adopted scientific discourse at an increasing rate. These strategies facilitate the acquisition of structural strength. Professionalisation and adoption of scientif ic discourse allows TRM primary resources to be legally identified, verified, and promot ed, therefore allowing institutionalisation, funding, status and commercialisation (second ary resources). The techniques used by the biomedical profession to constrain and cont rol the integration process, and by the TRM sector to secure more status and benefits ( secondary resources) in Sri Lanka are common themes demonstrated elsewhere in biom edical and TRM/CAM relations. 2848: Discussion and Conclusions 8.1 Introduction This research analysed the contested issue of integrating TRM in f ormal health care systems, and explored the history of policy development in this field in an in ternational health organisation (WHO). This was prompted by the intriguing development of the policy on TRM which appeared to lack consistent progress within the WHO as an organisation, and weak implementation on national levels. The release of the TRM Strategy by the WHO in 2002 presented a unique opportunity to examine a complete life cyc le of the TRM policy from the first inception of the concept in the 1970s (WHO, 1978b) to its culmina tion as an articulated global strategy in 2002 (WHO, 2002e). While the benefits of formalising the TRM in health care systems ha d been established by 1978 (WHO, 1978b), by 2003 \u0093systematic efforts have not yet been made to achieve integration of TRM/CAM with conventional health care delivery for the wider benefit of communities\u0094 (WHO, 2003c:97). This was despite almost universal recognit ion \u0093that unless traditional health practitioners are properly recognized, utili zed and articulated within the national health system, countries will never be able to achieve ad equate health coverage for all their people\u0094 (Roh, 2004:170). The anomalous situation of widespread recognition and support for the p olicy concept of integration, yet lack of tangible implementation, appeared to b e irrational \u0096 as what was proposed seemed to offer a feasible solution to addressing health c are needs in the South, as well as accommodating increasing consumer demand in the North. Formalising the role of TRM/CAM in health care seemed to rationalise health care resour ces in a manner which would benefit key stakeholders such as citizens and the state. There fore, lagging national policy formulation and implementation of the concept of integrati on hinted at peculiar difficulties such a policy may face. 8.2 Conclusions about the main research questions The central questions of why the issue of integration first arose o n the international policy agenda in the 1970s, why it seemed to languish and be resistant to im plementation in the 1980s, why it was regenerated in the 1990s and then reappeared in 2002 as a globa l policy constituted the main field of inquiry. This investigation explores t he lifecycle of the policy of integration and traces its changing fortunes on the international he alth agenda. 285In addressing this question, it became apparent that standard me thods of policy analysis were not suited to providing an adequate explanation for the peculiarit ies of the policy history. The intricacies of health policy and of TRM specifically m eant that what appeared to be a straight forward question was soon overwhelmed with complexi ties from a range of diverse fields such as anthropology, political science, sociology, health sci ences and economics. Each field represents a huge body of literature and encompa sses complicated issues. Therefore it quickly became apparent that not only did standard meth ods of policy analysis present difficulties, but also that evaluation would require some broad generalisations or abstractions to enable a simplification of data gathering and ass essment. As mentioned in the methodology chapter, these broad generalisations we re used to facilitate a more coherent and structured analysis, despite being based on \u0093artificial\u0094 dichotomies that some may reject as simplistic. The first is in the use of North and South . The other is in the use of TRM/CAM and biomedicine . These generalisations were theoretical abstractions which enabled both a macro (international) and micro (national) le vel analysis, over a long term period of approximately thirty years during rapid globalisation (1970s-2002). Over this time frame, a range of social and economic forces began operating an d interacting in complex ways which affected the policy domain. A policy analysis tool developed by Kingdon (1984) was used to hypothesise that these forces were affecti ng the initial appearance and disappearance, and then re-appearance of TRM/C AM on the international agenda. 8.2.1 Kingdon\u0092s multiple streams model Kingdon\u0092s (1984) \u0093multiple-stream\u0094 theory provided one way of interpreti ng the life cycle of the policy on integration. The multiple streams are problems , politics and policies . According to this policy analysis tool, the appearance of TRM/ CAM on the health policy agenda must be due to the \u0093coupling\u0094 of these streams when \u0093windows\u0094 of o pportunity open. Therefore, in the 1970s when it first appeared and in 2002 when it re-emer ged, there would be evidence of the problem , politics and policy streams merging. This was borne out in the analysis of literature over this period. It required a systematic assessment of the broader political, social and economic environment over three distinct era s (1970s, 1980s and 1990s). Many different factors came into play, and it can be concluded that the history of this policy within the WHO was not fortuitous but the result of the linking of these streams in a variety of ways. 286In the 1970s the political climate was very conducive to the concept of integr ation. There had been an awakening of nationalistic sentiment following a surge of independence in previously colonised states. Expressions of culture which had be en repressed or neglected under colonial expansion were embraced and celebrated, including indigeno us systems of medicine. These newly independent nations gained membership to int ernational bodies such as the WHO, and began to form blocs to promote their own economic and s ocial interests. The 1970s therefore represented a decade where the South achieved an unpr ecedented level of representation at the international level. At the same time, modernisation theories and the path of \u0093development \u0094 were being questioned. Modern technology, such as that represented by biomedicine, w as failing to meet the needs of populations in the South. Academics began pointing out the l imits of biomedicine, and critically exploring the links between biomedici ne and colonisation. Human rights, equal opportunity and social justice became prominen t themes. The problem of equitably delivering basic social services in resource poor co untries became paramount, as the era was also characterised by concern with longer term resour ce management. In relation to the WHO, these broader trends were reflected in th e problem of providing basic universal health care in the form of \u0093Health for All\u0094 (HFA) an d the policies of providing primary health care (PHC) and essential drugs were endor sed on a global level. Attached to these policies was the concept of utilising the manpow er and resources of TRM, as a form of delivering more comprehensive health care at a comm unity level. The use of TRM was promoted by new members of the WHO with China providing wha t was seen to be an inspiring model. It was an optimistic and idealistic era, and many believed that using TRM was a practical and feasible solution to the problems of cos t and access to biomedical services. Therefore, the policy of using TRM met an identified problem and the politics stream was amenable to the idea. The streams coupled and the issue gaine d prominence and support on the international health agenda. In the 1980s, these streams drifted apart and the window of opportunity closed. A paramount issue was the global recession, which forced a scaling back of exp enditure and caused attention to be diverted from social policy issues to one of economic im peratives. The role of the government in providing social welfare programmes such as health and education was questioned. Neoliberal economic rationalism gained hold of th e policy agenda and with it such concepts as cost recovery, \u0093user pays\u0094 and privatisation. In a ddition, other concerns such as environmental issues took priority later in the decade. In this new p olitical context, the problems became one of financing public services, resource management, increas ing the 287effectiveness and efficiency of existing programmes, an d addressing the impacts of recession such as unemployment. TRM managed to stay afloat during the 1980s by attaching itself to newl y emerging problems such as HIV/AIDS and environmental conservation. This approach w as explicitly encouraged by the WHO TRM programme director, who exhorted that \u0093pra gmatism should be encouraged and opportunities for linkages with other interes ts must be seized\u0094 (Akerele, 1988:358). However, despite attempts to attach it to high profile problems and contemporary issues, TRM suffered on the policy agenda as the primary programm es it was related to (PHC, HFA) floundered in implementation. The political and economic climate favoured more easily eva luated and implemented vertical interventions. Difficulties were presented by a climate of financ ial stringency and confusion as to how to effectively integrate TRM into health care sy stems. There was a lack of clarity as to how to implement such a goal, and ambiguities surrounding differ ences in the paradigms of TRM and biomedicine. It presented many problems in pract ical application, and the politics stream was clouded with debate and uncertainty as to how to proceed on national levels. Lacking financial and political commitment, TRM t ook a subordinate role on the agenda and little progress was made. In the 1990s, the problem stream changed rapidly in unforseen ways and TRM again arose on the agenda. New problems were recognised and gained in importa nce \u0096 such as protection of the environment and biodiversity, sustainable development (including t he role of indigenous knowledge), and the rapid and unregulated increase in the use of CAM in countries in the North. All these problems bore a strong relationship to TRM, and this merger of high profile agenda issues focussed attention back onto TRM and formalising its role in health care systems. Whereas in the 1970s access to health ca re and provision of low cost health services had been the paramount problem, in the 1990s, the problems became more closely tied to environmental protection, income generation fo r indigenous communities (sustainable development) as well as the provision of affordable health care services. The concept of using TRM was again suddenly pulled out of the policy stream in 2002 as it represented a solution to a variety of politically recognis ed pressing dilemmas. Over the twenty-five year history of the policy of formalising TRM in health care systems, it can be seen to flow on and off the agenda according to surrounding polit ical, economic and social climates. The policy content and objectives were al so shaped and influenced by the politics and problems streams . This history illustrates the premise of Kingdon\u0092s theory 288(1984) that the policy process is like a \u0093primeval soup\u0094 and the conception, survival and parameters of a policy are dependant upon the climate it evolves within . If a policy achieves great prominence on the agenda, then either one or both of the surroundi ng problem and politics streams must have coupled to enable it to gain weight at the political le vel. These problems may even vary over time, but the policy solution can remain the same . The fate of a policy may be dependant upon its ability (guided by its entrepreneurs or advocates) to quickly attach itself to emerging problems, to present itself as a feasible solution that appeals to current political, economic or social situations. While the evolution and final outcome of this policy initially appeare d ambiguous and intriguing, using Kingdon\u0092s (1984) multiple streams approach allows the history of this policy to be percieved as rational. It presented a practical solut ion to current problems of the day, and the political climate was right for change at those points i n time. So while in 1978 the rising use of CAM in the North had never been envisaged, and trying t o replicate a barefoot doctor scheme in the South seemed to be a worthwhile and achi evable goal, by 2002 TRM had become a massive business with huge economic weight and regul ating trade and protecting the environment rose to the fore as the key issues. The first technical report produced by the WHO on TRM in 1978 and the global TRM Strategy in 2002 seem worlds apart in scope, but match in their language and intent with the broader political and economic environments. The policy had evolved an d survived, re- emerging from the \u0093primeval soup\u0094 \u0096 adapting to the surrounding political, economic and social milieu and rising to the top of the policy agenda again nearly three decades after its initial conception. 8.2.2 Interest group interaction The WHO proposed in the global TRM Strategy (2002) that monopolistic health care systems had ceased to exist and that \u0093ultimately countries operat ing as inclusive (parallel) system can be expected to attain an integrative system\u0094 (WHO, 2002e:9). Howe ver, this assessment may fail to adequately take into account the politics stream , specifically interest group activity. Professional interest groups and the manner in which they interact have an i mpact on how the policy on integration is shaped, developed and implemented. While incorporating interest group interaction adds complexi ty to analysing the issue, it also offers an explanation for the fate of the policy on TRM and provide s further depth to understanding why it arose on the agenda in 1978, disappeared in the 1980s and then gained 289prominence again in 2002. It enables greater detail to be added to the frame work provided by Kingdon (1984) as it offers motives for the behaviour of significant inter est groups. How this operated is summarised in a generalised form below, and worked in combination with the factors described above operating in the problem and politics streams . The motives of interest groups were only one factor in the politics stream , but a crucial one. Using a synthesis of theories developed by Unschuld (1975; 1976b) and L ee (1982), biomedical and TRM/CAM interest groups can be perceived to be in comp etition with each other to secure resources. Unschuld (1975; 1976b) argued that these groups embark on a process of professionalisation in order to secure a monopoly on their pri mary resources and therefore gain exclusive right to the secondary resources that a ccumulate from their use. Lee (1982) proposed that the use of scientific discourse was also an imp ortant variable in this process, as discussed in the methodology. Therefore, these groups can be seen to compete to gain or maintain structural strength (secondary resources) in health care systems through techniques associated with professionalisation and scientific discourse. Lee hypothesised that certain social forces had emerged that encouraged the development of TRM/CAM such as the publicity given to Chinese medicine, the rise of nationalism, the advocacy of PHC and the promotion of TRM by the WHO (Lee, 1982:639). According to Lee, \u0093in view of the world-wide movement of modernization through s cience, the above various forces might turn out to accelerate the absorption of [TRM/CAM] into biomedicine\u0094 (1982:639). This hypothesis was also tested, by applying the theories provided by Unschuld and Lee within the framework offered by Kingdon. If these theories w ere correct, increasing professionalisation and the application and use of scientific di scourse would be observed over the timeframe, and competition for both primary and seconda ry resources would have a role in the formulation and implementation of TRM policy. These professional groups operate within a broader policy environmen t. Economic, social and political contexts influence their ability to promote or prote ct their interests and access to resources. The relationship of exchanging and transferring primary resources between medical systems has occurred throughout history (as described by Un schuld 1976:3-5), however colonisation, modernisation and globalisation have c reated a range of forces that have influenced this process, redefined the rules of engagement and presented particular obstacles and opportunities. In the 1970s biomedical primary resources were seen to be both ineffective an d expensive to treat common health conditions in the South. The primary resources of TRM were seen to 290offer a feasible alternative. While this idea gained support, it threatened biomedical interests as it endorsed the use of primary resources of competing medical syste ms and therefore sanctioned secondary resources to TRM. In addition, the use of TRM as pro posed in the 1970s implicitly promoted the use of manpower to deliver biomedical prima ry resources or extend basic biomedical services. As a result, tensions arose between interest groups in the 1980s and a stalemate ensued. The biomedical profession was reluctant to cede either primary or secondary resources to their rivals. They acted instead as gatekeepers to the integration proces s, demanding scientific validation of TRM and rejecting the use of manpower as auxiliary personnel in biomedical health care delivery systems. The biomedical primary resource base w as reasserted as offering the safest and most effective way to provide health car e. TRM practitioners were likewise unwilling to work in the limite d or subordinated capacity of health care auxiliaries without an increase in secondary resourc es. While enthusiastic to access biomedical primary resources, they were not as willing to pr ovide unlimited biomedical access to their own primary resource base. In the absence of any clear gain of secondary resources from the integration process, they obtained more from continuing to operate in the unregulated and informal private sphere. In the 1990s, their functional strength rapidly increased as consumer s in the North embraced TRM/CAM. Secondary resources accorded to TRM/CAM experienced a massive growth spurt, and the practitioners were anxious to protect them. To do so, the y needed to secure control over their primary resource base by professionalising and also conforming to demands to scientifically validate it. This was due to the need to identify, document, verify, and institutionalise primary resources in order to secure state r ecognition, funding, status and access to markets (secondary resources). Industrial producti on and distribution depends upon factors including regulation, standardisation and quality c ontrol. In the 1990s scientific discourse was therefore adopted with more frequency, and widespread pr ofessionalisation in the form of associations, conferences, journals and standards for tr aining and education gathered pace. The unanticipated establishment of a global market for TRM/C AM in the 1990s is a vital development, as it generated and intensified competition for contro l over primary resources and access to secondary resources. The growth of markets provi ded economic incentives (secondary resources) to practitioners for integration. Shifting primary resources (knowledge, techniques, drugs) from one group to another is possible onc e it is \u0093recognised 291that these resources will be of use in gaining access to mor e secondary resources\u0094 (Unschuld, 1976b:8). Some TRM/CAM practitioners accepted that in order to secure i ncreased secondary resources (status, prestige, and economic benefits), sci entific (biomedical) vocabulary and methods might have to be adopted. In seeking increa sed structural strength and dialogue with the state (and the WHO), they needed to conform t o dominant paradigms. While some medical anthropologists may view the adoption of biomed ical discourse as \u0093an unplanned and unconscious process of cultural imitation\u0094 (Anderson, 1999: 165), critical medical anthropologists would look more closely at the political and economic imperatives and antecedents of this trend. Accommodation on the part of TRM/CA M to reductionist biomedical concepts is compatible with capitalist ideology (Baer , 1989) and the commercialisation of TRM is facilitated by institutionalisat ion (Lock, 1990). Accepting a scientific agenda (for example, safety and effic acy) and undergoing professionalisation processes allows access to markets and s tate support (enhanced secondary resources) for TRM/CAM but facilitates its absorption into the biomedical coalition. Mass production, standardisation and regulation (commod ification) within commercial and rational-legal frameworks that are attuned t o biomedical, corporate philosophies also undermine core TRM/CAM principles. Therefore , in seeking to maintain or increase secondary resources and structural strength, their pr imary resources may ultimately be compromised and/or appropriated by the biomedica l profession. As the secondary resources of TRM/CAM grew in the 1990s, biomedical practi tioners began to see advantages in selective incorporation of TRM/CAM pri mary resources as this could provide them with secondary resources (economic benefits, prestige). Th ey therefore modified the biomedical paradigm, imposed \u0093evidence based medicine\u0094 requirements, developed \u0093mind-body\u0094 medicine, and began practising \u0093integrative medic ine\u0094. These techniques can be interpreted as efforts to consolidate and ma intain their structural monopoly in health care systems as this facilitates absorption and subord ination of TRM/CAM. Biomedical stakeholders dominated the integration policy process t hrough the application of western scientific discourse. This extends their structural domi nance in health systems through limiting the primary resources (and therefore flow-on se condary resources) available to TRM/CAM whilst inflating their own. The biomedical coalition at tempted to restrict secondary resources of TRM/CAM by first emphasising safety/dange r of their primary resources and by later strengthening calls for effectiveness and e fficiency to be 292demonstrated. This can be seen as moves to block and control the inte gration process and legitimation of TRM/CAM primary resources. The lifecycle of the WHO policy of integration from the 1970s to the present can be seen as part of the \u0093dance between biomedicine and [CAM/TRM] evidence of the still incomplete hegemony of biomedicine in its efforts to eliminate or control the competition\u0094 that Waldram describes as occurring in North America (2000:618). Saks refers to t his manoeuvring as a \u0093fluid battleground\u0094 where biomedicine preserves and enhances thei r position in health care using ideology, disciplinary and/or other levers (Saks, 1998:202-203). The dance or fluid battle revolves around constructing, preserving and extending the boundar ies of primary resources, and attempting to maximise the secondary resource s that accumulate from it. The policy agenda on integration on both an international and a national l evel can therefore be viewed as being manipulated by interest groups (stakeholders), who ar e motivated to secure resources \u0096 the rights to use various primary resources, as well as g ain power, money, status and authority (secondary resources). The long gestation and delayed implementation of the WHO polic y on integration may therefore be partly explained by competition between diff erent medical systems (interest groups), which required economic incentives (secondary resources) t o overcome. Development of a global market, combined with demographic and health transitions, changed the nature of the problem stream , allowing the policy of formalising the role of TRM to gain more influence and be revived on the internationa l agenda in 2002. This synthesised conceptual model based on Kingdon (1984), Unschuld (1975; 1976b) and Lee (1982) allows us to see that the process of integration in forma l health care systems is not neutral or technical, but political in nature. It involves allocating benefits to certain groups, and mediating the knowledge and authority of different medical s ystems in state funded health services. The timing of this issue on the agenda was no t co-incidental; it was the outcome of particular social, economic and political forces oper ating in tandem with interest group activity. These forces intensified with globalisa tion and resulted in TRM coming to the fore on the agenda of international organisations like the World Bank and the WHO. The WHO and other UN bodies play a significant role in th is process by setting policy guidelines and priorities in relation to TRM/CAM. Through international bodies, various interests and values are mediated and ultimately legitimi sed. 2938.2.3 The politics of medical pluralism If the state attempts to formalise the role of TRM/CAM (or TRM/CAM seek a formal role), then norms and principles for training, registration and practic e require standardisation and conformity to rational-legal state frameworks. Integration requires s ome level of professionalisation, which permits state involvement in defining or restricting access to the TRM/CAM primary resource base. For example, certain criteria may be required for qualification as a practitioner, which may exclude tradition al training methods. Accreditation, validation and standardisation (rationalisation) of education and training redefines the scope of practice and the knowledge base (primary resourc es). Setting standards for education in TRM/CAM can be interpreted as a n expression of \u0093biomedical dominance\u0094 or a reflection of \u0093turf wars\u0094, and play an important role in market control and exclusionary strategies (Shahjahan, 2004:409). Just as f ormalising education and training can present inherent difficulties, the process of profession alisation is also not universally considered a positive development in the context of TRM/C cousins in the North (Cant & Sharma, 1995:744), TRM may only reluctantly professionalise and jettison aspects and modes of their practice (such as those that cannot be scientifically verified) in a bargaining st rategy with the state and biomedicine. Some of the TRM/CAM groups appear to use strategies in seeking stru ctural strength that facilitate co-option by and subordination to biomedicine. Why do t hey lust for this \u0093fatal embrace\u0094? (van der Geest, 1985). Adopting these strategies may be \u0093rational\u0094 as there is only one process available to gain structural strength and secure fu rther secondary resources, such as access to markets and state funding: entering into dialogue wi th the state which necessitates unity/cohesion (identifying themselves as a profession or a group, documenting and codifying their primary resource base) and speaking a common language (scientific discourse). In practise, this is almost impossible, and such codif ication can serve as a means to exert or maintain control and authority. Once scientific discours e is adopted and training, education and practice is standardised and regulated (rationalised) T RM/CAM primary resources can be automatically co-opted by the biomedical professi on. The new \u0093profession\u0094 118 For example, Kleinman considers that \u0093professionali sation tends to distance practitioners from patient s, and prioritizes \u0093concern for disease ahead of interest in illness\u0094 (1984:147). Others note that it extends authority and control, and redefines the boundaries of the healin g system. 294can then be subsumed or marginalised within the lower echelons of th e biomedical sphere and/or adopted as an adjunct to biomedical practice. Therefore, the strategies used by TRM/CAM to obtain seconda ry resources \u0096 professionalisation and adoption of scientific discourse, may paradox ically serve to threaten and weaken control over their primary resources. These tac tics can eventually act against the interests of TRM/CAM, as they do not result in an equitable shari ng of secondary resources and result in limited structural strength (and may even weaken f unctional strength by alienating citizens), ultimately serving mainly biomedical, co rporate and/or other interests (see Cant & Sharma, 1995; 1996 for a description of this process with o steopathy). However, competitors to biomedicine appear to continually enlist these str ategies while seeking structural strength, sacrificing aspects of their primary reso urce base in the process and becoming subordinate or captive to biomedical/corporate/state in terests. Resisting professionalisation and scientific discourse could be s een as a counter-hegemonic strategy, but one less often pursued probably due to the sacrifice of potentially substantial secondary resources. For example, aromatherapists and reflexologist s have not made efforts to professionalise (Saks, 2003a:144) and Reiki shows no interest in sci entifically demonstrating efficacy and safety (Kelner et al., 2002). In doing so, these therapies will continue to be marginalised in the formal health care sector ( will never gain structural strength) but will maintain the integrity of primary resources. N ot all practitioner groups are likely to accept organising themselves, and formalising practice s and education, which will pose a challenge to the policy of integrated health care services (Thorne et al., 2002:912). Contrary to claims that the rising development and growth of CAM pr ofessions demonstrate that biomedicine was never \u0093hegemenous\u0094 (hegemonic) (Coburn & Biggs, 1986), the outcomes of CAM/TRM demarcating primary resource boundaries in the pursuit of secondary resources demonstrate that biomedical hegemony and their st rategic alliances can actually be augmented. This augmentation is a consequence of the automa tic subordination of the new professions, and the appropriation and commodification of their primary resources. This ultimately serves to enlarge the biomedical pri mary resource base and channels secondary resources to the biomedical coalition, th erefore enhancing and maintaining their structural strength. This leaves the question asked by Janzen (1978): How can CAM/TRM gr oups form associations sufficiently powerful enough to engage in dialogue with state bodies, without being co-opted or losing distinctive boundaries in that process? (i n Donahue, 1990:87). An 295intrinsic problem is that the modern state only speaks rational-l egal scientific language (in which biomedicine is fluent and uses to its advantage), does not recogni se non-professionals, and has already formed historical alliances with biomedicin e. Biomedicine has a legal structural monopoly on formal health care provision, and marke t domination (Freund, McGuire, & Podhurst, 2003:214; Kelner et al., 2004:917; Lee, 1982; Saks, 1998, 2003a; Waldram, 2000), which gives it much power and control in the health s phere and a status that is intimately linked to the modern state (Kleinman, 1995:39). Regulatory recognition is therefore simultaneously a threat and opportunity, which is difficult to navigate in asymmetric power relationships. Values and ideologies cannot be divorced from the process of official incorporation of TRM/CAM into f ormal health care systems. The scope of integration policies, the manner in which i ssues are defined and programmes proposed to achieve this will enshrine particular be liefs. The values embedded in the policy process (reflected in content, consultation and re source allocation), usually represent the interests of dominant groups and the power relations b etween stakeholders: \u0093even policy based on the best motives might yield unexpected and undesirable results: namely bringing [TRM/CAM] more under control of the biomedical professi on\u0094 (Kleinman, 1984:159). For example, as discussed throughout the body of the thesis, empha sising scientific validity, toxicity or safety and efficacy of TRM remedies may be seen a s an effort by the structurally dominant biomedical profession to limit and control the resource base of TRM practitioners. Over-emphasising the safety of patients in regulating TRM/CAM d isregards widespread errors in biomedical practice and impacts of pharmaceuticals th at can result in serious health problems to extend legitimac y to remedies that cannot conform to biomedical therapeutic models and demonstra te causality or efficacy restricts the scope of TRM/CAM practices. As Elling notes, power relations determine what is defined as effi cacious and acceptable (1981b:93).119 Scientific discourse is not neutral \u0096 it embodies social, poli tical and economic values, and ideologies that reflect and reproduce power relations ( Cunningham & Andrews, 1997; Navarro, 1980, 1984). Underneath claims of scientific authority and legitimacy/efficacy are political and economic interests whic h guide the interaction of 119 Last (1986:4) regards assessing drugs for their sa fety and efficacy as an enormous task. In Britain, 11 000 out of the 43 000 drugs on the market have not been reviewe d. The narrow, technical approach of biomedicine an d its concept of efficacy is a standard that Janes observe s biomedicine itself may not be able to meet (1999:1 808). 296medical systems (Janes, 2002:273). The orthodox biomedical paradigm is soc ially constructed (Dean, 2004), therefore it is \u0093contextual\u0094 not \u0093objective\u0094 (Jones, 2004), and scientific research is subject to bias and conflicts of intere st (Quah, 2003). Kelner et al. (2004) noted that the biomedical coalition constrained the professional development and jurisdiction of CAM in Canada by demanding scientifi c evidence of safety and efficacy; redefining what integration was; and opposing government funding being allocated for research. This protects the dominant position of bi omedicine and maintains existing \u0093jurisdictional boundaries\u0094 (Kelner et al., 2004). The ta ctics enlisted by the biomedical profession can be interpreted in Unschuld\u0092s framewo rk as having one goal: to preserve their primary and secondary resource base, in direct respon se to increasing CAM professionalisation. The \u0093jurisdictional boundaries\u0094 which Kelner et al. conclu de are what is at stake in the relations between biomedicine and CAM can be considered demarcatio ns between primary resource bases, and rights to secondary resources. Therefore, it i s not surprising that the biomedical practitioners in the study by Kelner et al. (2004) refused to endorse or encourage the professionalisation of CAM and instead presented obstacles an d stalling tactics. Similar tactics were evident elsewhere, in both the North and the So uth. Issues like efficacy and professionalism presented difficulties to structurally wea ker medical systems gaining legitimacy (Kennedy & Olsson, 1996:42), and therefore an increased shar e of secondary resources. Likewise, Coburn and Biggs (1986) found that the main conflic t between chiropractors and biomedical practitioners centred on such issu es as the validity of chiropractic theory and philosophy, the efficacy of technique s, and their scope of practice (Coburn & Biggs, 1986:1042). TRM and CAM overtly threaten the \u0093jurisdi ctional boundary\u0094 of biomedicine \u0096 the supremacy of their primary resource base and state sanctioned access to secondary resources. Janes (1999) and Eeuwijk (2000) consider that biomedical dominance in defi ning acceptable health care is one aspect of the larger process of globalisation. T hey fear that this dominance will obliterate local healing modalities and decrease medi cal pluralism. TRM is reduced to \u0093repositories of herbal concoctions where assumptions of effi cacy rest in scientific understanding of biochemistry\u0094 (Janes, 1999:1804). Co-option via a process of scientific modernisation even \u0093strip\u0094 TRM/CAM of therapeutic value ( Wahlberg, 2006:128). Scientific discourse tends to have a corrosive effect on comp eting traditions (Riley, 1977:551); it disaggregates, de-contextualises, and imposes a reduc tionist frame. Plans to \u0093rationalise\u0094 medical systems in many countries share the sa me goal of: 297 making local medical systems standardized components o f a larger structure that is ultimately linked to a world wide system of [biomedicine]. This goal is a powerful force in modern history because it expresses the dream of a future go od society in which modern science will be used benevolently and rationally to reliev e human suffering and distress (Leslie, 1980:191). 8.3 Conclusions about supplementary questions This case study on integration of TRM also aimed to illuminate s ome of the broader questions raised by researchers in relation to health policy a nd globalisation. These questions revolve around the processes of global health policy formulation and tr ansfer, and cannot be fully answered on the basis of a single case study. However, they can be clarified in relation to a specific health policy issue (namely, the integration of TR M in formal health care networks) as this thesis has demonstrated. 8.3.1 How appropriate are universal policy models? The global transfer of biomedical systems could be arguably one of the earliest examples of the use of universal policy models. In the 1970s, the application of the univers al policy model of health care based solely on biomedicine was found to be unrea listic. In the South, formal health care systems built on biomedical primary resources we re found to be inefficient and ineffective. The biomedical policy model wa s exported and entrenched with colonialism and imperialism, but foundered and by the mid-late twen tieth century was replaced with a more pragmatic approach advocating traditi onal medicine: By the late 1970s, national and international health managers wer e beginning to question the capacity and ability of Western medicine alone to deal wi th the health problems of the world. During the same period, Chinese and Indian traditional med icine systems were gaining popularity and prominence in the international arena. Hence, in 1978, th e International Conference on Primary Health Care, held at Alma Ata urged M ember States to (recognise) traditional medicine (Mensah, 2000:300). Therefore, it became clear throughout the twentieth century that a mono polistic biomedical policy model was not appropriate or feasible in all contexts \u0096 ini tially in resource constrained countries in the South, and later in countries in the North where new public health issues emerged and consumers embraced other health care modalities . The \u0093superior\u0094 biomedical model which had been transplanted worldwide, partly with WH O\u0092s advocacy and assistance (Lee, 1997) on the basis of \u0093universality\u0094 and with the assumption it woul d inevitably replace all other systems of medicine and healthcare, was the refore revealed to be flawed and medical pluralism was instead recognised and endorsed. 298 The concept of integrating TRM into formal healthcare system s was based on a model offered by China, which had achieved great success in improving h ealth indices and was considered a prototype by the WHO for other countries needing to con struct basic, low cost health services. This model was especially appealing to countri es experiencing the same problems faced by China, like many nations in Africa: \u0093All the problems mentioned in connection with health care delivery systems and methods in China i n the 1950s are with us in Nigeria today.\u0094 These included a shortage of manpower, mal-distr ibution of resources, and patterns of utilization (availability, accessibility, acc eptability) (Ademuwagun, 1979 [1975]:159). That is, TRM was widely accessible and socially accepta ble, and still extensively utilised in the informal health care sphere. While the WHO later recognised that each country needs to take a uniqu e approach to integration of TRM and that contexts would vary,120 it both explicitly and implicitly endorsed the model adopted by China. In the initial technical r eport on The Promotion and Development of Trad itional Medicine (WHO, 1978b), the committee considered that China demonstrated \u0093effective\u0094 integration, which was defined as a synthesis of traditional medicine and biomedicine \u0093through the application of modern scientifi c knowledge and techniques\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:16). Whilst details of TRM in other countries ha d been included in deliberations, only China was specifically mentioned as having al ready achieved integration \u0096 while other countries such as Sri Lanka and India wer e still \u0093advancing satisfactorily\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:12). The term \u0093integration\u0094 in the technical report (WHO, 1978b) was us ed in some places as a synonym for \u0093synthesis\u0094. As mentioned in the introduction (chapter 1), the formal integration of TRM in health care systems may take the form of an inclusive (or parallel) model where two or more systems of health and medical care co-exi st. This is separate formal recognition and the systems maintain distinct institutions for practitioner education and service delivery, such as in India and Sri Lanka. The other met hod for integration is integrative (integrated) systems where biomedicine and TRM are merged in medical education and service delivery, and jointly practiced (China). Th e inclusive or parallel systems are considered to preserve the identity of TRM, wh ile integrative approaches corrode it (van der Geest, 1985:12). 120 \u0093Traditional medicine should not be integrated into health care systems just because it is fashionable to do so or because other countries have adopted it. It has to b e integrated into a country\u0092s health system in the l ight of each country\u0092s unique circumstances.\u0094 Inaugural address by Nakajima (Director of the West ern Pacific Regional Office) at the Second Meeting of the Directors of Collaborating C entres (WHO, 1988:6). 299 The initial WHO consideration of formally incorporating TRM i nto healthcare systems in the most effective manner (WHO, 1978b) may have been clouded by the terminol ogy, as integration appeared to have been equated with synthesis rather than simply formal recognition (which may take different forms). The notion that an int egrative model was the superior form of integration may have also been heavily influenced by the information from China which dominated proceedings, and automatically linked to the im pressive health gains they had achieved. China was the \u0093shining example\u0094 of the \u0093potentia l which lies in integration\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:17), \u0093If China could succeed within one genera tion, then the whole world could likewise achieve some success in providing the entire population with adequate health care services\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:29). The parallel system of integration as adopted by India and Sri Lanka wa s presented in the report as a less effective method. The main problem ident ified with parallel models was that \u0093the practitioners \u0091borrow\u0092 freely from one another when the health s ituation indicated that such a practice would be advantageous\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:16-17) and that the \u0093need for integration then arose\u0094 (WHO, 1978b:17). Implicitly, parallel system s were deemed precursors to effective integration or \u0093synthesis\u0094, which is a po sition WHO appeared to maintain in the TRM Strategy : \u0093ultimately countries operating an inclusive [parallel] system can be expected to attain an integrative system\u0094 (WHO, 2002e:9). The notion that \u0093integrative\u0094 systems are the natural evolution or the ultimate policy goal when integrating TRM/CAM is contentious. This form of integratio n is only one method used to formalise the operation of pluralistic medical sys tems, and has rarely been achieved. The WHO recognises that only China, the Democratic People\u0092s Repub lic of Korea, the Republic of Korea and Vietnam have integrative systems (WHO , 2002e:9).121 Whether it is realistic or feasible to achieve equitable \u0093integrative\u0094 systems globally, is also controversial (Islam, 1994:83; Young, 1994). For example, biomedicine dominates all orga nisational relationships between medical systems in formal health ca re, and many aspects of TRM are excluded (Leslie, 1983:316). For these reasons, monopolistic and inte grative systems are very similar in practise (Young, 1994:66) despite the latter appearing to encompass medical pluralism. 121 The terminology used by WHO is ambiguous, as \u0093integr ative\u0094 systems are only defined as systems where TRM/CAM are officially recognised and incorporated in to all areas of health care provision (WHO, 2002e:8) , yet this term is usually more specifically used in the litera ture to refer to merging in education and delivery. However, by using these countries as an example it can be infer red that the WHO is advocating their processes used to achieve integration. In most cases, it was not clear which concept of integration was being proposed but integ rative and not parallel systems was generally implied (van der Geest , 1985:12). 300 Regardless of differences in the definition or application of the term \u0093i ntegrative\u0094 (that is, whether it means merging or synthesising disparate systems of m edicine in delivery and practice, or whether it means recognising and incorporating dif ferent systems of medicine into all areas of healthcare provision), this goal is beset with a host of conceptu al and practical difficulties. Addressing many of these questions is oner ous and they cannot be easily resolved, and universally encouraging (or anticipating) a ll countries to adopt this policy concept is problematic. The actual rate and degree of integr ation will vary according to location, as well as political and economic forces and other fac tors including the values and attitudes of individuals holding key decision-making positions in govern ment and healthcare institutions (Barrett et al., 2003:944; Saks, 2003b:162). Foreca sting \u0093how swiftly, to what extent, and in what forms integration will proceed\u0094 is very difficult (Barrett et al., 2003:944). The path to development of formal services in TRM will vary from country to country according to many factors. These include the existing st atus of TRM and its relationship with the mainstream medicine sector; the level of political wi ll within government to mobilize resources and accelerate change, often in the face of o pposition from established health care professional groups; and a research and training infrastructure If planned and developed appropriately for the national and cultural context, [TRM ] can be an effective and cost-saving means of providing culturally meaningful health care (Bodeker, 2001c: 64). The pursuit and adoption of simplistic models in the integration proc ess was warned against very early in the policy development process (Good et al., 1979:152), and som e forms of TRM may function more effectively outside of formal treatment settings (Kleinman, 1978). The process of \u0093bureaucratization may not only contribute little to biomedical care but undermine\u0094 specific forms of alternative healing (Kleinman, 1978:85). Fu lly integrative systems may not be viable in practice, and present a host of insur mountable difficulties in implementation. Feasible mechanisms for deciding which pract ices should be formalised and regulated and which are best left to private or informal spheres ha ve yet to be created (Thorne et al., 2002:913). The model eventually proposed by the WHO for integration of TRM w as considered by some to be a replication of the Chinese system (Bibeau, 1985:943), and the initial technical report on TRM (WHO, 1978b) did appear to promote it as the pre-eminent exa mple to follow. The supremacy of the Chinese model and the methods they had take n to achieve it \u0096 specifically and most prominently \u0093modernisation\u0094 through scienc e and technology, became embedded in WHO policy prescriptions on TRM. This was referred t o numerous times throughout the technical report (WHO, 1978b:41,30), and the importance o f applying 301modern science and technology in research on traditional medicine was emphasised repeatedly from the 1970s onwards. According to Bibeau (1985:940), the two main principles of the Chinese strategy were the development of TRM under the supervision of biomedicine, and a recognition of some technical aspects of TRM with a denial of the theoretical and conceptual foundations underlying it. These two principles formed an ideological prism and w ere also prominent guiding values evident in WHO policy and programme develop ment. The WHO focussed mainly on biomedical scientific enquiry into TRM drugs and te chniques. The safety, efficacy and quality of specific remedies and treatments were to be clinic ally verified by scientific methodology which was intrinsically held to be objective, superior and universally applicable. However, many aspects of TRM are considered beyond the realm of scienc e and are \u0093theoretically inexplicable within the domain of scientific discourse\u0094 (Berliner & Salmon, 1980a:543; Wahlberg, 2006:128). The approach of legitimising TRM via scientifi c validation may be extremely challenging as well as ultimatel y detrimental to the integrity of TRM/CAM philosophy, as it encourages the assimilation of on ly certain aspects into biomedicine (Unschuld, 1993:53). The pressure to comply with official health regulations, and the \u0093inability to succeed under the ethos of science\u0094 presented a n onerous challenge to the traditional Chinese medicine community (Quah, 2003). In addition, the model of integration adopted in China suppressed o r ignored the magico- religious aspects of TRM, and shamans, diviners and spiritual healer s were 1986:240; P illsbury, 1982:1827; van der Geest, 1985:11). Ignoring and excluding the religious or spiritual dimension of TRM was also endorsed by WH O. Healers using supernatural or spiritual techniques were beyond the scope of policy fo rmulation as \u0093their methods and beliefs are so diverse as to preclude their incorporatio n in any formal system\u0094 (Akerele, 1986:9) and the WHO had an \u0093objective and scientific approa ch\u0094 (WHO, 1986a:62). Therefore, while avoiding directly articulating a specific poli cy model to adopt, the WHO did actively and universally promote integration with the aim to a chieve \u0093integrative\u0094 systems, and endorsed the basic parameters of the Chinese process of doing so. These parameters included the central role of science and technology to verify TRM according to biomedical constructs, the control and regulation of this process by biomedical practitioners, and a recognition of some aspects of TRM (such as herbs and some therapi es) with a 302rejection of underlying conceptual foundations (including religious or spiritual dimensions). These principles can be seen to accelerate the absorption process o f TRM/CAM as Lee hypothesised (Lee, 1982:639), ultimately serving to amplify biomedical st ructural strength. The universal policy goal of \u0093integrative systems\u0094 driven by a top-d own approach may prove elusive even over a very long timeframe. In a top-down approach \u0093it i s assumed that policy formulation occurs within national governments, or at the inter national level, between donors and national policy makers. Once devised it is largely a technica l process to be implemented by administrative agencies \u0094 (Walt, 1994:153). However, the integration of TRM/CAM is far from a simply technical process, and implementation cruciall y depends on a range of factors including interest group interaction. As demonstrate d, the implementation of such a policy is fraught with obstacles. In contrast to a \u0093top-down\u0094 appr oach, the policy of integration is actually driven by a \u0093bottom-up\u0094 process. In botto m-up models, the implementers play a vital role in the implementation process an d interest groups have a role in influencing the policy outcomes (Walt, 1994:155-156). An integration policy driven by a top-down process which attempts to control implementation through regulatory mechanisms could theref ore be impractical. Achieving \u0093integrative systems\u0094 where TRM/CAM are officially recognis ed and incorporated into all areas of health care provision (WHO, 2002e:8) may not be technically or politically feasible, and overlooks the validity or appropriateness of informal integrati on already occurring at consumer and practitioner levels. Wolffers (1990:14-15) and van der Gees t (1985:13) argue that formal efforts to integrate TRM into health care systems are p ointless, as integration at the consumer level already exists and the interaction between medical systems is beyond regulatory control. The development of integrated systems i nvolves \u0093bottom up\u0094 processes, and the degree and form of integration achieved is partly the ou tcome of factors beyond direct bureaucratic command. Buse et al. caution against the wides pread transfer and adoption of universal policy models driven by top-down approaches as the y may be conceived from ideological preferences and lack an adequate evaluati on of whether the policy works, and under what conditions (2002:267). Top-down processes to achieve integration may be more effecti ve in communist or socialist countries where authority is centralised and interest group ac tivity is less able to intervene or influence policy formulation and implementation. For exampl e, in communist and socialist countries the biomedical professional lobby often has much les s power and autonomy (Maclean, 1986:16) and the governments \u0093refuse to allow the battles of profes sionals over the carving up of the medical arena to interfere with the delivery of health\u0094 (McDonald, 3031981:106). According to Unschuld\u0092s theory of medico-cultural conflict , biomedical and TRM practitioners require close government supervision or coercion t o co-operate, unless they gain an advantage (secondary resource) from doing so (Unschuld, 1976b:8). The presence of close supervision and political pressure may there fore be a crucial factor that contributed to China, the Democratic People\u0092s Republic of Korea , and Vietnam achieving integrative systems. 8.3.2 What are some of the forces be hind convergence of policy proposals? In relation to the policy proposal of integration of TRM into formal h ealthcare systems, a multitude of economic, social and political forces acted togethe r to create the environment for policy convergence (see Bodeker, 1994a; Islam, 1994). This occurred t wice, the first time in the 1970s when the use of TRM in delivering basic health care services w as proposed for wider application in the South. The second time was in 2002, when the int egration of TRM/CAM was proposed worldwide. The economic, social, cultural and political forces varied in t he North and South, but acted in a complementary manner to push the policy proposal of integration fir mly onto the international health policy agenda. Many of these were mentioned above ( 8.2.1 Kingdon\u0092s multiple stream model), which demonstrated how the problem and poli tics streams interacted over time. When the problems are shared across a variety of c ountries, or when different problems can be addressed by the same policy, there is a greater l ikelihood that policy proposals will converge. The same policy may offer promise in a ra nge of different contexts and be adopted to address diverse problems. Different objectives may t herefore exist in different settings despite common policy prescriptions (McPake, 2002). Economic forces acted strongly in creating the climate for convergence. Res ource constraints are highly relevant in the context of encouraging the need to consider low cost alternatives in health care delivery (Bodeker, 1994b:98). When restricti ng healthcare costs or working within limited budgets, TRM/CAM were able to gain more leverage on the policy agenda and were considered more seriously as policy solutions. Most c ountries in the South faced the situation of extremely limited budgets in the 1970s when the pol icy concept was first raised for transfer. At the turn of the 21st century countrie s in the North were faced with growing substantial costs related to chronic, lifestyle related cond itions that were not effectively treated by biomedicine. For example, obesity and depres sion threatened to become major costs to the state by 2020 (Janes, 1999:1807). 304 The need to restrict health care budgets in an environment of fiscal stringency was one factor in the convergence of the policy of integration, as TRM/CAM can offe r more cost effective ways to treat particular conditions and also place an emphasis on pre ventative measures. This emphasis on prevention, and benefits of therapeutic social relationships that many forms of TRM/CAM offer, presents both social and economic benefits to healthcare. Formally incorporating TRM/CAM can therefore expand the deliver y of basic health services as well as reduce the burden on biomedical infrastructure. A separate economic force also contributed to convergence of the polic y concept of integration \u0096 the growth of a massive economic market for herbal r emedies, and therapeutic products and services of TRM/CAM. This multi-billion dollar int ernational market created regulatory pressures and gave weight to TRM/CAM on the policy agenda . Governments in the North could no longer ignore the informal health sector which mo re people were patronising and which was growing rapidly. Governments in the South a lso needed to act on this trend, as establishing intellectual property rights became crucial in order to protect economic profitability and access to markets. The rapid commodif ication of traditional knowledge and biological resources generated new revenue streams in the So uth, which required legal protection. The growth of these international markets enabled new economic trends and development theories of the 1990s (sustainable development and the use of indigenous knowl edge for furthering development efforts), to be put into practise. Genera ting income, encouraging self-reliance and self-sufficiency while conserving and protec ting natural resources, were the main themes of sustainable development. Servicing markets in the No rth allowed the South to benefit from the notion of \u0093sustainable development\u0094 as plants, herb s and biological resources could be developed as cash crops. Capitalising on the mar ket growth for herbal products, which the World Bank projected would be worth US$3 trillio n by the middle of the 21st century (Bodeker, 2000), became another incentive to formalise the rol e of TRM/CAM for a variety of interests in both the North and the South. Social and cultural forces interacted with economic trends, to create a climate f or convergence. In the 1970s in the South, the use and practice of TRM emerged as a valid cultural expression, linked to nationalistic sentiment and the prese rvation of heritage. The use of TRM had been sustained on social levels during the years of colonisa tion, and this public use in informal spheres was recognised and sanctioned when the pol icy concept of integration arose. Later, in the North, the new social trend of r ecourse to alternative forms of 305health care created an increase in the use of TRM/CAM and the need to f ormally recognise this. The surge in use of TRM/CAM correlated with a social moveme nt of growing environmental awareness and requirements to conserve biodiversity, and also created pressure on existing biological resources. This encouraged closer m anagement and regulation of the use of TRM/CAM and the need to incorporate these considerations into policy frameworks. Demographic trends and associated epidemiological and public health issues rein forced the need to consider TRM/CAM as health policy op tions internationally. In the South during the 1970s, family planning and maternal/child health issues were crucial matters, reflecting concerns of the day with population growth and infant mortality. Condi tions that were causing high mortality rates were infectious and preventable (di arrhoea, malnutrition, malaria), and did not require expensive biomedical technology to tr eat. Prevention, education and public health measures were increasingly viewed as having mor e important roles to play. Later, HIV/AIDS and malaria became significant public health concer ns. In the North, diet and lifestyle related conditions (such as obesity, depression, diabet es, heart disease, cancer) as well as an increasingly elderly population emerged as serio us health burdens. All of these public health matters are complex problems that canno t be addressed or managed with sole reliance on biomedical infrastructure. Tech nical, curative interventions were increasingly ineffective to meet the emerging health need s of populations. Such conditions require a focus on health education, prevention and/or psyc ho-social support mechanisms. While clinical interventions may be necessary, prevention, education, diet and support (of which TRM/CAM systems focus) are equally or more impor tant aspects. Intractable public health issues that are not readily resolved by biom edical measures therefore created a need in the North and the South to review and incorporate ot her approaches. All these economic, social and cultural forces inte racted in complex ways: aging populations, suffering from degenerative and chron ic diseases will turn increasingly to non-biomedical alternatives for biomedical treatmen t. Yet the very same social and historical processes that produce the health transition a lso entangle indigenous medicine in social forces that seriously impede its ability to develop w ithout complete accession to the authority of Western science. Nations with viable and well develope d indigenous systems face the prospect of losing the core features of these system s, and in the process, losing the elements of diagnosis, treatment and care that have bee n argued to comprise the greatest benefit and which may provide highly desirable options under the curre nt contexts of neoliberal health reform (Janes, 1999:1817). Social and economic forces were given political weight with widespread legal recognition of TRM/CAM by the 1990s. In the 1970s, the revival of TRM was partly a political response to 306post-colonial developments, and was related to asserting indepe ndence and validating nationalistic sentiment. Later in the North, political recogniti on of the popular demand for CAM encouraged the allocation of resources for research, and es tablishment of government sponsored institutions or inquiries dedicated to TRM/CAM. For exa mple, political interventions played a significant role in the development of CAM in the US (Eskinazi & Mindes, 2001:21). Economic, social, cultural and political forces acted toge ther to create a climate for convergence, although the nature of the forces differe d temporally and geographically. By 2002 when the integration of TRM/CAM was proposed f or global application, the variety of forces interacting in the North and So uth made the policy concept appear to be both a viable and desirable development worldwide. 8.3.3 What are the requirements for successful transfers of he alth policies? One of the difficulties with successfully transferring healt h policies is that they are often indivisible from the broader political, social and economic environment f rom which they originated. What may appear promising in one country may not produce the same outcomes elsewhere, because a myriad of factors contribute to population hea lth outcomes and specific health policies and programmes may only be one contributory factor . This is particularly evident with the case of integration of TRM, where some argued that the economic and political situation in China was unique, and that their particula r health policies could not be simply transferred to other contexts (Blendon, 1979; Doyal, Rosenthal, 1981:612; Sanders & Carver, 1985:183). The health policies of China were like a \u0093new species which have a dapted precisely to a particular ecological niche\u0094 and were thus considered to be ra rely (if ever) directly transplantable (Geiger in McQueen, 1985:934). Whether health policies are broadly transferable therefore depends on the nature of the policy itself and the context within which it was initiated. T he complication with this, as mentioned above, is being able to determine conclusively what the links are be tween the health policy or programme, and its outcomes in isolation from any othe r influencing factors. In some cases, particular enabling conditions are required for succes sful transplantation of a policy concept. These particular conditions may not always be apparent without sufficient time to observe and evaluate outcomes, or undertake comparativ e analysis. For example, using volunteer community health workers was considered unac hievable in the absence of precise conditions (Walt, Perera, & Heggenhougan, 1989) and essential d rugs schemes also had pre-requisites for implementation (Lall & Bibile, 1978). The ci rcumstances for 307successful transfer may be difficult to replicate and inclu de distinctive social, cultural or political factors. In looking at broader requirements for successful transfers of hea lth policies, the factors that Hogwood and Gunn (1984) list for \u0093perfect implementation\u0094 offer an indicat ion of some of the pre-requisites (see also Walt, 1994:154-155). While they are referri ng to policy in general, the conditions are also applicable to health policy more specifi cally. Hogwood and Gunn emphasise that \u0093perfect implementation\u0094 is unattainable , but that certain conditions act to increase the likelihood of success (1984:198-206). These include: circumst ances external to the agency do not impose crippling constraints; adequat e time and resources are available; the required combination of resources are available; the policy is based upon a valid theory of cause and effect; that the relationship between cause and e ffect is direct; that dependency relationships are minimal; there is an understanding and agreement of objectives; that the tasks are fully specified in correct sequence; there is perf ect communication and co- ordination; and that those in authority can demand and obtain perfect co mpliance. It can be seen that many of these conditions are difficult or even impos sible to obtain. This is especially the case with regard to complex policy fields li ke health - where there are many participants, the relationships between cause and effect are somet imes obscure or indirect, and there are many agencies that contribute to outcomes observed . Some health policies may be easier to transfer than others, particularly those that match as closely as possible those factors mentioned above for \u0093perfect implementation\u0094 (Hogwood & Gunn, 1984:198- 206). Converting these conditions to health policies, would lead to clearly a rticulated, narrow, vertical (disease specific) interventions. Such policies have cl ear objectives, a set list of defined tasks or activities, are based upon a theory of cause and eff ect that is direct, and are implemented by single (or limited) agencies within a determ ined timeframe. Communication and co-ordination is therefore clearer, objectives agreed and mea surable, authority usually hierarchical, and compliance easier to enforce and supervise. This may be one reason why health policies and programmes that are ba sed upon vertical interventions (or that are restrictive in scope) are more e asily transferred than policies which are longer term, require major organisational restructuring an d substantial allocations of funds. Narrowly defined and clearly articulated policies are eas ier to obtain agreement on, to determine and fund costs, and to implement and monitor. For examp le, the essential drugs (Chowdary, 1995) and tuberculosis (Ogden, Walt, & Lush, 2003) programmes achi eved success in replication partly because they were specific prob lems with specific solutions. They also employed branding and marketing strategies, which wer e considered important 308factors for success (Ogden, Walt, & Lush, 2003:44; Walt & Harnmeijer, 1992). It is unfortunate that most health problems are socially complex an d cannot be addressed by such narrow technical solutions, addressing single issues (or the \u0093ma gic bullet\u0094 approach) (Macdonald, 2005; Peabody, 1995:741). In contrast, broader concepts such as PHC and integration of TRM were hind ered in their transferability as they lacked clear strategies, there were wide divergences in definitions of central terms which led to confusion about meaning, and the policy cou ld be interpreted differently by different actors in the policy process (van der Gee st, Speckmann, & Streefland, 1990:1025; Wolffers, 1990). Flexible and abstract notions like PHC and integration are thus very difficult to translate and transfer successfully into workable policies. Ambiguity may help achieve international consensus, but i s not helpful in making difficult decisions at national levels (Reich, 1987:49). In addition, s uch interventions require close collaboration across health, economic and social sectors, a nd community level participation and education. These types of interventions are l ess predictable in outcome, and more laborious to implement (Zielinski Gutierrez & Kendall, 2000: 86) and thus require high levels of political support and allocation of substantial resources. Therefore, it was a practical development for PHC to be redefined a s \u0093selective PHC\u0094 (Walsh & Warren, 1980) in terms of the policy process, even though this m ay have eventually undermined the ultimate goals of PHC (Macdonald, 1992:72; Newel l, 1988:904; Walt, horizontal org anisational structure; selective PHC replicated a hierarchical vertical managemen t. The programmes were run as separate projects, with their own staff, facilities, logos and acc ounting systems (Walt, 2001:682). This approach appealed to bodies responsible for implementation a s it strictly defined activity; did not require radical re-organisation of hea lth care systems; absorbed designated resources and was easier to evaluate and monitor. As s uch, it was easier to garner both economic and political support, and implementation was clear er and more direct. In summary, the successful transfer of health policies firstly requires sufficient objective and detailed comparative information, to determine the extent that other economic or social policies may have produced or contributed to the observed health outcom es. If the health policy in question was implemented at the same time as a cluster o f policies or reforms across sectors, this may affect the validity of the health polic y or programme to achieve the desired goals. Clearly observed cause and effect needs to be d etermined, and central terms of the health policy clearly and unambiguously defined. 309The common criteria between countries that have successfully adop ted the policy need to be isolated, and whether this matches the conditions in countries where the p olicy is to be transferred need to be assessed. Whether the required legisl ative and regulatory frameworks exist for policy and programme development has to be determined (fo r example, in some countries TRM is still not legally rec ognised). Obstacles in execution, how these were overcome, and timeframes and costs to achieve full implementati on are also relevant in assessing the practicality of replication elsewhere. Finally, p olitical commitment, co- operation of key stakeholders, consistent guidance and support, a nd sufficient resources are required. 8.3.4 What is the impact of intern ational initiatives at country levels? The impact of international initiatives at country levels can vary widely. In relation to TRM, the impact at national levels could be argued to be minimal. For ex ample, the critical indicators identified in the TRM Strategy 2002-2005 (2002e) demonstrate that very little progress had been made on national levels between the 1970s and the e nd of the century. Only 25 out of 191 member states had a TRM/CAM policy (13%), 65 member state s had laws and regulations on herbal medicines (34%), and 19 member sta tes had a national research institute for TRM/CAM (10%). The international initiative to integrate TRM into health care systems in the 1970s therefore appears to have made nominal impact on national levels in the following de cades. This may be partly related to the complexity and contentious nature of the po licy issue (which was not purely technical in nature), but also because adoption of the policy as envisaged had onerous requirements that acted as a deterrent. For example, the faci lities and resources required to undertake the scientific testing to determine safety and efficac y (which were considered prerequisites to incorporation) were lacking in countries in the South. Many countries were severely constrained by a lack of funds \u0096 for example, in Nigeria me dicinal plants were not pharmacologically screened due to the lack of funds for extract ion (WHO, 1996e:33), the Philippines were cautious in committing funds, and Kuwait argu ed that funds were not available to introduce TRM practices into their healthcare sy stem (WHO, 1986a). Resources were therefore often unavailable or absorbed by other priorities. [O]ne needs the facilities of pharmacological laborator ies, which do not exist in most of the countries of the Third World, because multinational corpo rations are not doing any research work there or providing the necessary technology (Said, 1982:22). 310The primary requirement for integration, as articulated by WHO, was therefore a major stumbling block at national levels. The scientific expertise and technology needed to undertake inventories and assess clinical efficacy or determine \u0093appropriateness\u0094 was simply unavailable, ironically in those countries that were to benefit the most from the development of low cost health care services. It was a paradox that although i ntegration of TRM was a cost-saving strategy in the longer term, it could not be implemented due to expense incurred in the short term (van der Geest, 1985:11). The \u0093low technology\u0094 solutions were being implemented through a very high technology approach, which may have be en unrealistic to expect or demand from member states in the South. The international initiatives of PHC and integration of TRM can be se en to have internally contradictory and conflicting philosophies. This may be one reaso n why they were unable to be effectively reconciled at national levels. For example, W elsch (1986) points out that the definition of PHC provided by the WHO had an emphasis on communit y participation and self determination, with a simultaneous demand for scientific s oundness. This calls for the \u0093bottom-up\u0094 development of health services, yet is structured as a \u0093top-down\u0094 approach, where the experts oversee and guide the \u0093uninformed\u0094 comm unities. Similarly, the principles provided by the WHO to guide and encourage the integration of TRM were r esource intensive, and required scientific expertise that was lack ing in target countries. Many of the questions raised by the integration of TRM/CAM are conce ptually complex, and there is little practical information to guide their resoluti on. While presented as straightforward by the WHO, all of the policy objectives of the TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e) present inherent complications. For example, in achieving \u0093integr ative systems\u0094 where TRM/CAM is officially recognised and incorporated into all ar eas of health care provision (WHO, 2002e:8), raises the questions (amongst many others) of which t ypes of TRM/CAM should be offered in public health delivery? How is that to be determined ? What should be reimbursed under health insurance? What should be included in nation al drugs policy? What form should the education of practitioners take, and how does this accom modate non- conventional forms of training? Countries were still grappling with the considerable practical implications of integration in 2000 (see appendix 7, page 361, for an excerpt of a WHO (2000a) regional report). Even decades after the policy concept of integration was rai sed, the main difficulties facing national governments in implementation (according to the WHO) were a lack of mutual understanding between TRM and biomedical practitioners, a lack of com munication between governments and TRM practitioners, a lack of evidence based on scient ific research, and a 311lack of funds and human resources as well as a lack of measures to protect intellectual properties and patents (WHO, 2000a:11). In 2000, non co-operation and a la ck of understanding between practitioner groups was still evident and the same conceptual questions asked in the 1970s were again being raised \u0096 for example, whether \u0093integrating the knowledge of traditional healers into the western system and vice versa was feasible\u0094 (WHO, 2000a:26). To date, the most significant impact of the WHO policy of integrati on of TRM on national levels could be seen to be symbolic. A policy usually has two component s \u0096 a verbal component (statement of purpose, pledge and intention), and an effectiv eness component (regulatory rules, grants and resources). If a policy lacks the effectiveness component, it can be termed \u0093symbolic\u0094 (Eyestone, 1978:15), and in the vast majority of m ember states no practical measures had been taken to implement a policy on integra tion policy even 30 years after it was initially proposed. Hours called this form of passi ve acceptance of TRM an \u0093alibi\u0094 or \u0093smokescreen\u0094 which costs very little but offered many institutional advantages (1986:48). Regardless of practical outcomes, it was symbo lically significant for the WHO to recognise TRM and later CAM. The biggest impact on one level could be seen as t he recognition and validation of medical plurality, an acceptance of dive rse healthcare traditions and alternative healthcare modalities. This was a turning point for the WHO as an organisation, which had previously only promoted biomedicine and the modernisation of healt h care through the adoption of biomedical models. However, despite this validation, it was also symbolically important that it maintained the rubric of biomedical ascendancy an d thus perpetuated and reinforced the existing hierarchical and asymmetric power r elationships between medical systems. 8.3.5 Is there \u0093lesson-drawing\u0094 in health policy development? The process of lesson-drawing \u0093starts with scanning programmes in effect elsewhere, and ends with the prospective evaluation of what would happen if a progr amme already in effect elsewhere were transferred here in the future\u0094 (Rose, 1991:3). Lesson- drawing specifically refers to determining how practical and desirable it is to transfe r policies. The critical analytical question is \u0093[u]nder what circumstances and to wha t extent would a programme now in effect elsewhere also work here?\u0094 (Rose, 1991:4). 312The WHO was lesson-drawing in the 1970s by \u0093scanning\u0094 (or observing) pr ogrammes and policies that had addressed the problem of delivering basic healthcar e services in environments of resource constraint. In the 1970s the WHO was actively see king comparative information on how successful low cost healt h care services had been implemented, especially in those countries that had achieved good outcomes in health indices (Djukanovic & Mach, 1975; WHO, 1975). From these evaluations came t he ideas of community health workers, primary health care, and integrat ion as part of a lesson-drawing process also involves determining likely success in other settings \u0096 how and why a programme works in one country and the likely success or fa ilure in another country (Rose, 1991:23). While such policy concepts and programmes as PHC and integration of TRM might have been desirable in other settings, whether they were practical was another matter. Distinguishing between desirability and practicality is an impo rtant aspect of lesson-drawing (Rose, 1991:25). According to Rose, the most interesting confrontat ion between political desire and technical expertise occurs when there is a highly de sirable programme but the specific conditions for replication or transfer do not exist (Ro se, 1991:26). The attractiveness of a Japanese programme associated with its economic miracle may be as compelling to Western policy makers as the call of the femal e sirens was to sailors in Greek mythology. However, the siren call of mythology lured sailors onto roc ks; the siren call of Japanese success may attract policy makers to a programme that is likely to fail, because the preconditions for effectiveness in Japan are not met elsewher e (Rose, 1991:26). It could be argued that the Chinese model of integration and the u se of community health workers in the form of barefoot doctors was an extremely strong \u0093 siren call\u0094 in the 1970s. These policy concepts were associated with the public health m iracles achieved in China. For example, between 1952-1982 China\u0092s average life expectancy incr eased from 35 to 68 years, and infant mortality was reduced from 250 to 40 deaths per 1000 li ve births (Hsiao, 1995:1047). These outstanding improvements were achieved with a large po pulation, low per capita income, lack of professionally trained health personnel and limited biomedical infrastructure. The Chinese success was a result of a new way of organising and distributing limited resources, rather than of increasing expenditure (Cox, 1989:44). The lure of achieving such striking positive health outcomes with re stricted resources must have been incredibly strong to international health policy ma kers and in countries facing similar conditions to those experienced in China. While China of fered a particularly inspiring or compelling example, the utility of the model may have had less validity in other 313settings. Particular policy models may offer great incentive or stimulus, especially when other countries face similar problems . However, it may take some time to realistically assess what the outcomes of the policy were, and how effective it was indepe ndent of other social or economic policies. In some respects, it could be argued that complete lesson-dr awing did not occur in the WHO with regard to using TRM practitioners as community health work ers, and the integration of TRM. While the desirability of policy transfer was considered, the required conditions and probability of replication was less prominent in analysis. Firstly , it was assumed that the impressive health gains witnessed in China had been achieved l argely through the integration of TRM and the use of community health workers (barefoot doctors). W hilst these were undoubtedly factors, they were not solely or independently responsib le for improvements in population health. A range of various economic and social policies con tributed to overall improvements in health indices (Cox, 1989:44; Sanders & Carver, 1985:180-183; Si del & Sidel, 1975:11). Beyerstein and Sampson (1997:3) argue that the utility of barefoot doct ors was exaggerated and they were really equivalent to \u0093first aid attendants\u0094. H erbal remedies and TCM therapies contributed much less to the improvement of population health than thei r efforts in communal health projects such as sanitation, access to safe dr inking water, the control of several parasitic epidemics, containment of sexually transmitted diseases, and improvements in diet and immunisation rates (Beyerstein & Sampson, 1997:3). In ad dition, the equitable distribution of food, housing, and social services was a major co ntributing factor to improved health indices (Cox, 1989:44). Has the use of large numbers of primary health workers \u0096 an d particularly barefoot doctors \u0096 been responsible for the unparalleled advances in the health of the Chinese population? And can the barefoot doctor experience be somehow isolated from the social process in which it evolved and, by implication, be successfully transplanted to societies whose po litical and economic conditions are quite different? The answer to the first [is that there was] a wide range of h ealth promoting interventions \u0096 many from outside the health sector before the substanti al strengthening of primary health care As to the second question: the underlying answer re sts in the fundamental change in the organisation of the Chinese economy [which enabled free , universal health care, and sanitation and immunisation programmes] (Sanders & Carver, 1985:180) Secondly , there were unique conditions present in China that enabled successful implementation of the policy on integration and the use of barefoot d octors. The presence of very specific social and political conditions were found to be requi red for the introduction of successful volunteer community health worker schemes elsewhe re (Walt, Perera, & 314Heggenhougan, 1989). While the Chinese example provided inspiration and hop e for other developing countries (Leslie, 1985b:929), they lacked some of the crucial pre -requisites that provided fertile ground there (Sanders & Carver, 1985:180-183). For examp le, particular economic factors (Blendon, 1979), an extremely strong political counter force to the domination and resistance of the biomedical profession (Rosenthal , 1981:612), and a TRM profession that was highly organized and more unified and already part ially institutionalised. Traditional Chinese Medicine was based on a written history and mor e uniform in theory and practice \u0096 whereas for example, the diversity of systems and stand ards of knowledge in Africa presented more challenges to incorporation (Oppong, 1989:609; S emali, 1986:95). Thirdly , while the idea of barefoot doctors was seized upon as offering a potenti al solution to the delivery of low cost health care, it was simplified and mo dified in a manner which may have made it unworkable in practise or far more difficult to im plement. Barefoot doctors were not TRM practitioners given basic training in biomedicine, but an entirely new volunteer manpower category (Pillsbury, 1982:1832; Velimirovic, 1984b:69). Creati ng a new and separate category of community health workers was a prag matic method to overcome the difficult task of forging relations between biomedical a nd TRM practitioners (Pillsbury, 1982:1830). A distinctive attribute of the barefoot doctor scheme was the strongly altruistic and ideological commitment they displayed (Ronaghy & S olter 1974:1331 in Doyal, 1979:288). However, the WHO instead determined that rather than create a new category of personnel trained in both systems to fill roles in the PHC sphere as the Ch inese had done, the training and development of existing TRM manpower categories in basic biomedicine was preferred (WHO, 1978b:21). This objective overlooked the political tensions and str ongly entrenched historical ambivalence between biomedical and TRM practiti oners. It was also unrealistic to expect that heath services could be extended at no cost using volunt eers or TRM practitioners trained as community health workers. While these workers were unpaid in China, it was optimistic to anticipate that volunteers would be a ble to support the expansion of such programmes elsewhere. As articulated by Unschuld\u0092s theo ry of contested resources (1975; 1976b), without any secondary resources (economic benefits, status) it w ould be very difficult to recruit and maintain TRM practitioners as PHC worke rs. The WHO later recognised this, with the suggestion to offer some for m of remuneration or reward (WHO, 1995a:11), as the lack of payment for undertaking extra P HC duties produced minimal incentives for participation. Constraints experience d on national levels in the implementation of community health worker schemes, and in using T RM practitioners in this 315role, reflected the lack of adequate \u0093lesson-drawing\u0094 from either the Chinese experience or other countries. There was considered to be a lack of policy gui dance and government commitment, lack of dialogue and co-operation between the two groups of practitioners, conflict between practices and paradigms of health, poorly defined r oles, lack of organised representative groups for TRM practitioners, and little practical evaluation of existing programmes (WHO, 1995b:43-45). Finally , the assumption that complete integration had been attained i n China may have been inaccurate, and it would seem that the form of integration achieve d was not universally supported. By the late 1980s, it was being argued that the integration of TRM had never been fully achieved (Chen 1989 in Janes, 1999:1812). Although China was often classi fied as system (Bodeker, 2001b; Stepan, 1983; WHO, 2002e), Hesketh and Zhu (1997) described the status of the systems as one of \u0093co-exist ence\u0094 with integration only a \u0093possibility for the future\u0094 and conditional upon demonstrated clini cal effectiveness. This was recognised by the Chinese government when it was noted that \u0093[o]bviously, there is not complete integration: it is still too early to expect that I n effect, there are now three systems: traditional, Western and integrated\u0094 (WHO, 1986a:35). The Chinese model institutionalised domination of TRM by biomedicine an d there was not genuine equity between medical systems (van der Geest, 1985:12). The true synthesis of both systems of medicine was considered by some to be \u0093doomed to failure \u0094 mainly due to the lack of conceptual compatibility (Unschuld, 1976a:315; Unschuld, 1976b: 15). The achievement of \u0093real\u0094 integration was therefore questionable, as a bias to biomedicine was inherent in the model and certain aspects of TRM were excluded. The approach of legitimising TCM via scientific validation can be eventuall y negative (Unschuld, 1993:53), despite enabling mass production, commercialisation and globa l export. The processes and impartiality of techniques used in China to achieve integration w ere critically questioned by academics and practitioners, and implementation found to be a ver y long and complicated process. A difficulty with objective lesson-drawing in the case of integr ation of TRM was that there appeared to be a lag in critical analysis of the Chinese expe rience. While some early commentators were reflecting on the broader validity of the situatio n in China in the late 1970s (Blendon, 1979; Doyal, 1979:288; Good et al., 1979:152), it was not until the 1980s that more evaluative information began filtering through the po licy & Carver, 1985; van der Geest, 1985). The vast majority of information analysing the situation in China was 316not produced until after it had been endorsed by the WHO as a model to e mulate (WHO, 1978b). Perhaps the problems were so pressing and political sentimen t on the issues of low cost health care so strong, that the practicalities of transfer may have been overlooked. The merits of integration and processes to achieve it may also have been overshadowed by a wave of nationalistic sentiment propelling TRM onto the agenda as an effective means to address health issues in the South. China definitively reorientated the question of traditional me dicine back to one of national pride. The Chinese had no intention of demanding or even p assively accepting Western medicine as other developing nations had. They were instead emph atic about bringing their own health care practices into the world spotlight. Follow ing the Chinese lead, during the World Health Assemblies of 1973 and 1974 delegations from Zaire, Dahomey , Congo, Guinea, the United Republic of Cameroon, Sri Lanka, India and Malawi , may of which had never before mentioned the topic, began speaking of their t raditional medicine as a positive affirmation of their native cultures (Lee, 1997). The nature of the WHO as an organisation may also have hindered its ab ility to effectively lesson-draw in the case of policies like the integration of TRM. T he WHO is dominated by the biomedical profession, and it did not recruit sociologists or an thropologists (Foster, 1987; Godlee, 1994a:711; Walt, 1993:138, 139). Information from the social sciences that c ould have informed the policy formulation and evaluation process w as thus peripheral to the focus of the WHO. The almost exclusively biomedical and technica l boundaries of the WHO created an environment where integration was viewed as an adm inistrative exercise, and contributing political and economic factors were ignored or overlooked. For example, conflict and tension between TRM and TRM practitioner groups was downpl ayed and only mentioned obliquely (if at all) in most policy and programme docu ments.122 The WHO attempts to maintain an \u0093apolitical, neutral stand\u0094 ( Chowdary, 1995:138) and refrains from directly commenting on political and economic policie s that had an impact on health. It seemed to consider that the relationship between polit ical systems and health system organisation was remote (Elling, 1981a:87) which may expl ain why, in relation to the situation of TRM in China, including the use of barefoot doctors, the political nature and significance of the exercise were overlooked (Navarro, 1984:469). Thi s neglect of the political dimensions of the structure of health care systems, a nd avoidance of political issues and tensions in integration of TRM/CAM was also was evident in t he TRM Strategy (WHO, 2002e). 122 Science was upheld as the objective intermediary i n any cases of discord: \u0093Conflicts between the Weste rn- trained doctor and the traditional practitioner are bound to occur, in any society, but [Vietnam] looks to science to resolve this problem. Let us use science wisely to t est the values of the past.\u0094 (WHO, 1986a:64) 317 Whether the WHO actually is non-political and strictly concerned wit h technical health issues is discussed below. Remaining aloof from political issues is di fficult (or even impossible) in the contested environment of health policy, and wh en health issues have an inherently political dimension \u0096 in spite of the fact that the W HO was based on and guided by the principle of \u0093studiously (avoiding) political or cultural contr oversy\u0094 (Godlee, 1994a). 8.3.6 Are values transmitted through international organisations? The WHO is usually considered to be an impartial agency, advising on technical health issues and is perceived to be \u0093neutral\u0094 (Walt, 1994:131). The WHO secu res much of its influence and legitimacy from the perception that it is a techni cal professional body that operates on a basis of apolitical scientific consensus (Peabo dy, 1995:737; Walt, 1994:134). Any country can join the WHO as long as it contributes financially acc ording to an agreed formula (Walt, 1994:131), and there were 191 member states in 2002. However , the employees of this organisation do not always act objectively \u0096 the y may be influenced by the government of their nation (Walt, 1994:133) or biased by professional affiliat ions (Lee, 1997). A significant amount of the WHO\u0092s: authority is derived from its professional core of medica l doctors. Not only does the medical profession have a high status among other professions but it serves a s an internationally cohesive group. Doctors have common bonds and common global standards (Walt , 1994:134). According to Peabody, two key myths give the WHO strength as an org anisation. The first is that it \u0093is a politically neutral, technical agency that se ts an international standard of social justice by improving health\u0094 and the other is that it \u0093is uniquely q ualified to improve health in the vast and complicated international arena of divergent po pulations besieged by overwhelming diseases\u0094 (Peabody, 1995:736). However, the biomedical basis of the WHO has created a homogenous work force operating within a rigid str ucture, viewing health issues through a \u0093single lens\u0094 (Peabody, 1995:737). As many health issu es are not amenable to technical-biomedical solutions, the WHO has limited capacity to address increasingly complex and multidisciplinary matters (Peabody, 1995:737-739). The n arrow biomedical orientation thus influences and restricts the manner in which the W HO perceives and responds to health issues (Lee, 1997). Navarro contends that the WHO, through its reports, reproduces id eologies and political positions (Navarro, 1984). How it interprets health issues, and the s olutions proposed to 318address them, therefore reproduce particular values and ideologies. In relation to the integration of TRM in formal health care, it has been demonstrated that a biomedical focus clearly influenced the development of this process, and that the bi omedical paradigm was the dominant ideology promoted by the WHO. For example, within the policy of integration, biomedical concepts, scientific methodology and the supervisory positi on of biomedical expertise were assumed. A reductionist, secular frame was use d in which herbs and plants (biological resources) were a prime focus, and clinical validi ty was a core concern. Objectives that the WHO promoted and supported as neutral (such as safet y, efficacy, quality, appropriateness, proper use) are in fact embedded with value judgements. As mentioned above (section 8.2.2), power relations determine what is defined a s efficacious and acceptable (Elling, 1981b:93) and scientific discourse is not impart ial, it embodies values and ideologies that reflect and reproduce power relations (Navarro, 1980, 1984). Claims of scientific authority and legitimacy/efficacy re present political and economic interests (Janes, 2002:273) and dismissing or approving of TRM on account of its \u0093scientific\u0094 basis is motivated by ideological and political f actors (Unschuld, 1976b:7). Scientific discourse is a medium through which power, dominatio n, and control can be expressed and maintained. By endorsing biomedical authority and expertise in the process of integration, the WHO was accelerating and institutionalising a movement that some c ontend is a part of a larger process of globalisation \u0096 that of biomedical dominance in definin g acceptable health care (Eeuwijk, 2000; Janes, 1999; Wahlberg, 2006). The promotion of TRM by the WHO according to t hese strict parameters was therefore encouraging the subordina te absorption of TRM/CAM into biomedicine (Lee, 1982:639), and reproducing and entrenching hierarchica l relations in medical pluralism. 8.4 Implications for theory The implication of the \u0093resource model\u0094 used for analysis in thi s thesis, is that it offers an alternative mechanism to scrutinise health policy formulation and implementation. It presents a mediating framework based on broader theory that is connected to a specific policy issue (Ham, 1993:183). The framework focuses on stakeholders and a ctors in the policy process, specifically interest groups. It assists in the gener ation of knowledge about actors (stakeholders, interest groups) in the policy process \u0093so as t o understand their behaviour, intentions, interrelations, agendas, interests\u0094 (Brugha & Varvasovszky, 2000:239). Such information can then be used to both guide or evaluate the polic y process, 319to develop strategies, facilitate implementation, understand the pol icy context and assess the feasibility of programmes and policies (Brugha & Varvasovszky, 2000:239). Like other tools for policy analysis, such a framework provides desc riptive, predictive and explanatory tools (Reich, 1996). As a descriptive tool, it enables the sy stematic collection and organisation of information about a specific health policy. I t allows the content of the policy, goals and objectives, the positions of key players (interest groups or other actors) and the opportunities and obstacles to policy change to be assessed. As a prescriptive tool it provides a method to design strategies for implementation, assess th e impact of policy and programme options and the feasibility of reform. As an explanatory tool, it can explain health policy outcomes, and interest group responses, and identify underlying interests served by policy objectives or pro gramme goals. Its efficacy in this regard has been demonstrated by its application t o the policy of integration. As has been demonstrated, it has offered an explanation for why the policy goal of integration proved difficult to execute on national levels, despi te apparent international consensus and support \u0096 the first aim of this study. The use of the \u0093resource model\u0094 as a framework for heath policy ana lysis enables both a micro and macro level of assessment. The framework is flexible in application, so can be used at local (community) levels, national levels, or at organisa tional levels including international organisations. A micro-macro approach is facilitat ed by observing how power and authority are used to legitimate, structure and allocate health care resources (Janzen, 1978:124, emphasis added), making Unschuld\u0092s theory of medico-cultural conflict (Unschuld, 1975, 1976b) based on contested resources particularly applica ble in this context. It offers a way to conceptualise health care resources, and how th ese health care resources are defined, legitimised and allocated by the state and by interes t groups in a medically pluralistic health care system. This analytical framework combines political science tools of po licy theory and interest group interaction, with anthropological insight into the inter action of medical systems. As a multidisciplinary tool, it offers a theoretical construct wh ich may be useful in disciplines such as critical medical anthropology. Such a framework addre sses an obstacle in the theoretical development of critical medical anthropology, as i t provides a methodology to explore the political dimensions of medical pluralism. The us e of macro-micro models to explore medical pluralism, that take into account broader poli tical and economic contexts, have been encouraged by medical anthropologists (Janzen, 1978; Singe r, 1986, 1990): 320 critical medical anthropology struggles to synthesise the macr o level understandings of the political economy of health with the micro level sensiti vity and awareness of conventional medical anthropology (Singer, 1986:128). In this way, the use of the \u0093resource model\u0094 contributes to the understandi ng of policy processes within the complex, contradictory and contested health fi eld \u0096 the second aim of this study. 8.5 Implications for further research The \u0093resource model\u0094 used for analysis in this thesis could be u sed in a variety of ways in future research. It could be applied at national levels to provide str ucture to the context of health policy formulation, implementation or evaluation. This may be with reference to policies of the integration of TRM/CAM, or more broadly to other heal th policies or programmes (such as primary health care, or essential drugs) or in rel ation to specific health conditions (e.g. malaria, HIV/AIDS). The analytical framewor k may offer particular promise as an explanatory tool for health policies or programmes that have been resistant to implementation. It can guide research that is historical in na ture (assessing health policy development of a specific type or in a specific location), or ass ist in feasibility studies of different policy and programme options. As limitations of space and the large timeframe covered necessi tated a superficial analysis of many of the issues involved, the analytical framework could also b e applied in more detail over specific epochs (such as each decade, or even prior to the 1970s), or to some of the subjects or themes raised (such as traditional medicine, intelle ctual property and TRIPS; the commodification and industrialisation of TRM; the World Bank proje cts on the conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants; the export of specific TRM systems to new locations; evidence based medicine and TRM/CAM). 347 Appendices 348Appendix 1: WHO ACTIVITIES \u0096 TRM (resolutions, documents, meetings) 1969 World Health Assembly resolution 22.54 (establishment o f pharmaceutical production) 1972 International survey of 20 countries and the use of TBAs 1973 Consultation on the role of the TBA in maternal and child hea lth and family planning, Geneva Organisational study on methods of promoting the developme nt of basic health services Official Records No.2206 Geneva 1974 Interregional Seminars on the Training and Utilization of Traditional Birth Attendants in Maternal and Child Health (San Salvador 29 September \u0096 5 Oct; Phillipine s 2-6 Dec). 1975 Verderese, M & Turnbull, L.

October 16 1974 On the one hand we have the persistence in tens of millions of people of such diseases as cholera, malaria On the other we have we have the gigantic modern mac hinery geared up to the treatment of a whole range of disease up to the point of obfuscating the d istinction between life and death. In one sophisticated city more than 70% of all so-called health exp enditure is used on people who are going to die within the next twelve months. In another a networ k of sophisticated renal dialysis centres catering to the needs of a few hundred patients with chronic k idney disease was given priority over a network of rural health centres catering to the needs of hun dreds and thousands of women and children. These examples reflect, in my opinion an obsession al concern of the medical profession \u0096 my own profession \u0096 with marginal disease and tend to pervert t he very concept of health. Countries further down the scale are busy imitating this ki nd of perversion. In a developing country, which constitutionally declares health a universal human r ight, you find in one province 80% of the health budget being used to support one teaching hospital, whereas in outlying parts complete coverage is supposed to be achieved by one general purpose di spensary for half a million people and the costs are spir alling ov er the last 20 years the cost of medical care rose by 300-500 %. While in the same year period the population in such countr ies increased by 10-20%, hospital utilization rose by three and a half times that figure. Paradoxically, with such stupendous cost increases and disease addiction has gone increasing dissat isfaction with the health care system because serving champagne to the few while many do not get t heir daily bread is hardly promoting confidence. (Elling, 1981b:90-91) 356Appendix 4: China as a model China provided an inspiration to the international commun ity in the 1970s, and a main factor in the health gains achieved was deemed to be the novel incorporati on of TRM into health service delivery. The prominence given to China\u0092s experience is clearly reflec ted in the WHO original policy and programme development, and continues to the present day. For example, the Western Pacific Region of WHO (of which China is a part) has produced far more report s on TRM than any other region; the distribution of Collaborating Centres for TRM is weighted t o China (in 2002 there were 7 centres in China alone compared to 1 for the entire South-East Asia Regi on); two of the three meetings of Directors of these Collaborating Centres were held in Chin a, and WHO publications on TRM also have an emphasis on TCM, specifically acupuncture. A brief overvi ew of the development of TRM and biomedicine, and the form of integration implemented in C hina is described below. History 123 For over 2000 years, TCM124 was both the functionally and structurally dominant medica l system. In the 19th century, despite the import of biomedicine, TCM mai ntained structural and functional strength through continued social and political support. However, in the early 20th century, an epidemic of plague allowed biomedicine to assert superiority and clai m structural dominance. The success of biomedicine in dealing quickly with this epidemic encourag ed official recognition and support, and \u0093made many social and political elites realize the urgency of medical modernization through science\u0094 (Lee, 1982:632). In the first half of the 20th century, biomedicine became t he structurally superior form of medical care in China. TCM strongly resisted their diminished reputation , and there was a lot of tension between medical systems throughout this period. A younger generat ion of intellectuals aided the increasing biomedical status, by rejecting TCM as a potent symbol of outm oded traditional culture that had to be eradicated to ensure China\u0092s growth and development (Croiz ier, 1976:342). The organisation of a national professional association of TC M in the early 20th century can be seen (according to Unschuld\u0092s paradigm) as a direct response to the increasing structural competition from biomedicine. Biomedical doctors formed a National Medica l Association in 1915, and successfully lobbied the government to promote biomedicine and restric t TCM (Lee, 1982:632). The Institute for National Medicine, founded in response to a Government res olution in 1927 to eliminate TCM, was able to block attempts to regulate and reduce its scope (Cro izier, 1976:346). However, although biomedicine was able to achieve structur al strength it was never able to achieve functional dominance. Despite official recognition and su pport, it was not able to gain widespread social popularity beyond the elite \u0096 particularly in rural areas. A comprehensive biomedical infrastructure could not be effectively established, and t he resource intensive nature and specialised training requirements for personnel were obstacles to thi s goal. In this period, neither TCM nor biomedicine were functionally strong, as many depended upo n localised healing traditions (Lee, 1982:632-633). 123 provide detailed overviews the history o f TCM, and the relationship between TCM and biomedicin e in China. Lee (1982), Chi (1994), Bibeau (1985), Jingfeng (1988) and Purcal (1989) provide briefer accounts. Quah (2003) looks specifically at the ethos of scie nce applied to TCM, and Taylor (2004) looks at the influence of the W est on Chinese medicine. 124 TCM is the majority TRM system in China, but not t he only one. It is a collective term that refers to many different systems created by different Chinese minorities. The term TCM usually refers to that used by the Han na tionality, which accounts for up to 95% of the Chinese populat ion (Cai, 2000:140). TCM is the traditional form of medicine developed and promoted in state institutions, post 1 956 in mainland China (Taylor, 2004:98). 357Incorporation of TRM in the formal health system Following the Communist revolution in 1949, a main priorit y became improving the health of the population. Despite the communist emphasis on modernisat ion through science and technology, TCM became a central aspect of the health strategy (Sidel & Sidel , 1975). This was in line with the Maoist emphasis on using indigenous resources to achieve modern go als (Croizier, 1976:347), and self reliance. It also corresponded with the patriotic importa nce given to national heritage and customs, and desire to democratise health care. Integration was guided b y the principle of modernisation of TRM through science and technology (Jingfeng, 1988; Taylor, 200 4). In the early period of Communist rule, the use of TCM was base d on an expedient and pragmatic attitude of mobilising all medical resources, and it was pro moted \u0093because it was readily available, rather than because of any inherent value it had\u0094 (Bibeau, 19 85:939). Initially, this urgent practical need to expand the resource base was the motivating force for government policy on the recognition of TCM (Chi, 1994:315) and it was considered a \u0093stopgap\u0094 measur e until the biomedical infrastructure could be expanded (Croizier, 1976:347). However, in the mid -1950s, this was augmented with an ideological commitment to China\u0092s unique medical heritag e as part of an upsurge of nationalistic sentiment (Bibeau, 1985; Croizier, 1976). The health strategy used by the Chinese was to develop both TCM and biomedicine, and also integrate them at both the operational and theoretical l evels (Lee, 1982).125 This was called a health policy of \u0093walking on two legs\u0094 \u0096 using both biomedicine and TRM in health care. On a theoretical level, TCM theory was scrutinised using modern scientific techniq ues, in order to establish the efficacy of remedies. This clinical work was intensively undertaken in the 1950s and by 1958 both systems of medicine were officially accorded equal status in the healt h system (Hesketh & Zhu, 1997). At an operational level, thousands of new health workers were tr ained in both basic biomedical and TCM principles. These \u0093barefoot doctors\u0094 were responsib le at the village level for disease prevention and education, and were considered the showpiece of the Cultur al Revolution in the mid-1960s. Biomedical and TCM doctors were also educated in the basic concepts of eac h others systems and encouraged to co-operate with each other, while TCM infrastructure was exp anded. Equity of TCM and biomedicine? In practise, some commentators questioned the equity of TCM a nd biomedicine in the health care system and the extent of success in their synthesis. Lee comm ents that although resources were directed to TCM, biomedicine maintained power over health affairs and therefore remained structurally superior (1982:633-634). By the 1960s, although integrati on was still advocated, it appeared that TCM had been relegated to a \u0093supplementary and inferior posit ion\u0094 (Croizier, 1976:350). In this period, th condescension and contempt\u0094 (Bibeau, 1985:940). Unschuld states that by 1976, the pressure on b iomedical practitioners to use TCM \u0093vanished almost completely\u0094(1993:52) and by the late 197 0s, attempts to reconcile TCM with biomedical concepts had failed (1993:53). From the late 19 70s, China commenced a program of international exchange emphasising science and technolo gy fields, including biomedicine. Lee proposed that these efforts would continue to strengthen th e structural position and functional strength of biomedicine in formal health care delivery in the futu re (Lee, 1982:634). The true synthesis of both systems of medicine was considered by some to be \u0093doomed to failure\u0094 mainly due to the lack of conceptual compatibility (Unschu ld, 1976a:315; Unschuld, 1976b:15). Later, 125 Only a simplified outline of the complex history of T CM in health care has been presented here. Efforts t o integrate TCM did not only emerge post Communist rule . Various strategies had been considered from the 19th century in response to the challenges presented by t he import of biomedicine (Chi, 1994:315). Unschuld discusses three main approaches to legitimize the continued exi stence of TCM, and traces their origins and shifting emphasis from the 19th century throughout the 20th century. These were a \u0093na\u00efve idea of combining the best practices of both traditions\u0094; an effort to \u0093join [TCM] to experimenta l science and Marxist dialectics\u0094; and a strategy t o \u0093present [TCM] in a conceptually restructured version adapted to sp ecific cognitive values of Western medicine\u0094 (1993: 46-47). 358proposals to merge the two systems were not politically supp orted. Instead, a parallel system was advocated with co-operation encouraged only where viable ( Unschuld, 1993:52). This was promoted as \u0093Three Roads\u0094: the independent development of both sys tems (two separate roads), with them coming together (third road) where practicable. Therefore, the idea of merging primary resource bases of both systems was replaced by the concept of allowing each m anpower group to use different primary resources while working within a single health care system (Unschuld, 1976b:15). Others have questioned the contribution made by TCM to the h ealth gains achieved, and considered the success of the barefoot doctor scheme as not directly att ributable to dual training in both systems of medicine. Rather, their role in massive public health ed ucation campaigns and programs is considered more significant. Beyerstein and Sampson (1997 :3) consider the training of barefoot doctors as equivalent to \u0093first aid attendants\u0094 and argue t hat herbal remedies and TCM therapies contributed much less to the improvement of population heal th than their efforts in communal health projects such as sanitation, access to safe drinking water, the control of several parasitic epidemics, containment of sexually transmitted diseases, and improv ements in diet and immunization rates.126 In addition, the equitable distribution of food, housing, an d social services was a major contributing factor (Cox, 1989:44). Integration? Although some have classified China as effectively demonst rating an integrated system (Bodeker, 2001b; Stepan, 1983; WHO, 2002e), Hesketh and Zhu (1997) desc ribed the status of the systems as one of \u0093co-existance\u0094 with integration only a \u0093possibil ity for the future\u0094 and conditional upon demonstrated clinical effectiveness. According to Bibeau (1985:940), the two main principles of the Chinese strategy were the development of TRM under the super vision of biomedicine, and a recognition of some technical aspects with a denial of the theoretical foundations underlying it. The integrity of TCM was threatened by the approach of selective ly choosing specific remedies (guided by biomedical principles) and neglecting conceptual foundat ions. \u0093Genuine\u0094 integration was therefore questionable, as a bias to biomedicine was inherent in the m odel. It was not until 1999 that there was legal recognition of equal status of TRM and biomedical pract itioners (WHO, 2000e:12). This approach of using scientific methods to evaluate and \u0093 refine\u0094 TCM was considered by Chi as the \u0093most fortuitous\u0094 of approaches, as it was less problemat ic than that experienced with earlier approaches or in other countries such as India (1994:315). I n India in the mid-1960s, many schools that had been established to train practitioners in a synthe sis of biomedicine and Ayurveda were closed by student riots. The unrest was due to the graduates wanting the same recognition and salary (secondary resources) as that provided to biomedical gradu ates. Most of the colleges converted to granting biomedical degrees, others reverted to teaching \u0093pure Ayurveda\u0094 (Taylor, 1976:290). Perhaps officially endorsing biomedical control in asses sing the resource base of TCM removes potential for overt conflict between practitioners, and av oids addressing complex issues such as theoretical synthesis. In contrast, Unschuld considers t he approach of legitimising TCM via scientific validation as ultimately detrimental, as it encouraged the assimilation of only certain aspects of TCM into biomedicine and the rejection of the rest (1993:53). This illustrates Lee\u0092s argument (1982:640) that TRM may increase structural status through adopting a scien tific basis and rationalising training and education, but this may ultimately facilitate the proces s of their selective absorption and subordination into biomedicine. 126 Bayerstein and Sampson (1997) argue integration was a politically motivated and economically convenient move by Mao, who continued to use biomedicine for his pe rsonal health care. Mao stated in 1944: \u0093We cannot solve our problems be merely relying on the doctors of the new [biomedical] school. Of course, the doctors of the new school are superior to those of the old [TCM] school; but they do not concern themselves about the sufferings o f the people \u0094 (Bibeau, 1985:939) . 359Appendix 5: Extract from Traditional Birth Attendants - A field guide to their training, evaluation, and articulation with healt h services (WHO, 1979b) Allusion has been made at times to the notion of \u0091integrat ing\u0092 the TBA into the organized health system. This has been viewed with mixed feelings of enthusias m and trepidation. Integration has been openly enunciated and discussed in several countries, but a s yet there is no known systematic framework for this. If by integration is meant that TBA\u0092s sho uld be so intimately connected to the organized health system that they might finally lose thei r identity as perceived in the traditional sense, this might well lead to conflict between TBAs and other categ ories of health personnel in the organized services, as well as between TBAs and the communities they w ould be expected to continue to serve. Integration in this, the true, sense of the term should be av oided at all costs, since it would defeat the purpose of programmes to extend health services to underser ved populations. In order to ensure that the identity of the TBA remains intact and that the TBA continu es to serve the community, only informal and flexible links should be developed between her and the or ganized health system. Thus, the question should not be one of defining the role of the TBA in t he modern system of health care delivery but one of defining the role that the modern system can play in helping TBAs to perform more safely those tasks they generally perform on the basis of the princ iples of mutual self-help and humanitarianism. In this context, the concern should not centre of integrating the TBA into the modern system but rather on ensuring that, within the TBA as a person, modern and traditional concepts and modes of practice are so integrated as to eliminate only trad itional practices and rituals that are clearly shown to be harmful, and to instil only modern concepts an d techniques that are absolutely essential to the safety of the persons under care of the TBA. For the above-mentioned reason, those who have been closely i nvolved in the preparation of this guide decided to use the term \u0091articulation\u0092 rather than \u0091i ntegration\u0092. \u0093Articulation\u0094 according to Webster\u0092s Dictionary of Synonyms, implies \u0093organizatio n in which each part fits into another in a manner comparable to the fitting into each other of two bo nes at a moveable joint and a structure so built that it functions as a whole yet without any loss of fle xibility or distinctness in any of its component units or without any conflict between them. (WHO, 1979b:7-8) 360Appendix 6: The Chiang Mai Declaration - Saving Lives by Saving Plants We, the health professionals and the plant conservation spe cialists, who have come together for the first time at the WHO/IUCN/WWF International Consultatio n on Conservation of Medicinal Plants, held in Chiang Mai, 21-26 March 1988, do hereby reaffirm our comm itment to the collective goal of \"Health for All by the Year 2000\" through the primary health care appr oach and the principles of conservation and sustainable development outlined in the World Conser vation Strategy. We: recognise that medicinal plants are essential in primary he alth care, both in self-medication and in national health services; are alarmed at the consequences of loss of plant diversity ar ound the world; view with grave concern the fact that many of the plants tha t provide traditional and modern drugs are threatened; draw the attention of the United Nations, its agencies and Me mber States, other international agencies and their members and non-governmental organisations to: the vital importance of medicinal plants in health care; the increasing and unacceptable loss of these medicinal pla nts due to habitat destruction and unsustainable harvesting practices; the fact that plant resources in one country are often of crit ical importance to other countries; the significant economic value of the medicinal plants use d today and the great potential of the plant kingdom to provide new drugs; the continuing disruption and loss of indigenous cultures, which often hold the key to finding new medicinal plants that may benefit the global community; the urgent need for international co-operation and co-ordi nation to establish programmes for conservation of medicinal plants to ensure that adequate quantities are available for future generations. We, the members of the Chiang Mai International Consultatio n, hereby call on all people to commit themselves to Save the Plants that Save Lives. Chiang Mai, Thailand 26 March 1988 (http://users.ox.ac.uk/~wgtrr/chiang.htm ; accessed 1 May 2004) 361Appendix 7: Extract of national level reports From: Development of National Policy on Traditional Medicin e (WHO, 2000a) The promotion and integration of traditional medicine encou nter many hurdles in Asian countries. Cambodia, for one, is burdened by financial problems. In th e Cook Islands, the lack of legislation for changes in the national health agenda has stifled traditio nal medicine in spite of the fact that majority of the population patronize it. It was, however, proposed tha t the Cook Islands situation could be solved through advocacy. T he Fiji delegate recommended that a movement in traditional m edicine should be initiated [professional association] and dialogues with g overnment officials should be started. The issue of intellectual property rights remained controversial an d according to the delegate from Fiji, this issue should be looked into. The report of the delegate from French P olynesia drew questions inquiring if criteria in selecting traditional healers existed. In Fiji t here was none. The Malaysian delegate mentioned that the criteria were made by \u0093God\u0094[religious dimensions], thus, making it difficult to question their validity. The delegate from Hong Kong, China, added that criteria for traditional healers were important for accreditation and credibility. Malaysi a faced a peculiar problem in that scientists involved in the research and development of herbal medicine s did not want to share data and knowledge. A question was raised about how strict legislation for trad itional medicine should be in comparison to food legislation. The general opinion was that food legisla tion did not require such high standards as legislation on medicines did. Dr Chen Ken gave a summary [of] the main difficulties [facin g] governments: \u0095 a lack of mutual understanding between [TRM] healers and modern medicine; \u0095 a lack of communication between governments and healers; \u0095 a lack of evidence based on scientific research; and \u0095 a lack of funds and human resources as well as a lack of meas ures to protect intellectual properties and patents. Creation of a better understanding between traditional he alers and modern medicine seems to be one of the important goals. In many countries, traditional m edicine is not accepted by the [bio]medical society (e.g. the Philippines). (WHO, 2000a:10-11). As a s olution to the problem of lack of understanding of [TRM] and non co-operation between practi tioners of Western and [TRM], it was discussed whether integrating the knowledge of tradition al healers into the western system and vice versa was feasible. Introduction of [TRM] curricula in the w estern system has, however, only been possible in some countries, e.g. in China, but not in the Rep ublic of Korea. For this reason the group proposed as a solution either to encourage practitioners t o practise both systems of medicine to complement each other, where applicable, or to introduce t raditional medicine curricula in the western system, where applicable. Furthermore, introduction of edu cation and training to traditional health practitioners as well as an attempt to convince other health care providers that traditional medicine does not intend to compete but to safeguard public health co uld be potential options. (WHO, 2000a:26) 362Appendix 8: Kava \u0096Traditional resources as tradeable commodities The example of kava encapsulates many of the complicating factors surrounding traditional plants and their use beyond original cultural, social and economic sph eres. It is presented in detail to illustrate the intricacies of the issues, and can be seen as a microcosm of what was occurred with TRM and globalisation on the international level. This material i s mainly from Pollock (2000), observations and information gathered during a visit to Vanuatu in November 2 002, and from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community website. The botanical garden in Vanuatu h as a large section dedicated totally to kava, including information on the cultivation, preparati on, and socio-cultural aspects of use. Background Kava ( Piper methysticum ) is one among several closely related species selectively c ultivated over thousands of years for use in Pacific Island communities as a beverage. It has a social (\u0093ceremonial\u0094) role in their lifestyle, which varies slightly in expressi on between Islands. It is highly significant as a symbol of social cohesion and a valued part of their heritag e, inherently embedded in the cultural fabric of these nations and recalled in legends, songs and poems (Po llock, 2000:5). Today it is considered the \u0093national drink\u0094 of Vanuatu and men gather to drink it at dusk in dimly lit and very quiet kava bars (nakamel), although women also consume it (less publicly an d not as widely). Over the centuries, ritualised cultural expressions were attached to it and it e volved multifaceted social uses. For example: the uses include as a symbolic gift; marking of particular occasions and expressing communal unity; it has special grinding plates for the roots , and bowls for mixing and serving it; huts for consuming it; servers to distribute it; seating, serving a nd consumption patterns indicating social status; and gestures and protocols that govern preparation and consumption, affecting its potency. Therefore, its use was regulated and controlled by tradition al methods (traditional legitimacy) which were bound up with honour and respect and also imbued the dr ink with some of its physiological influences, as well as social and spiritual meaning. Kava was banned by missionaries in the early 20th century, b ut made a strong return to use in Vanuatu after independence in l978 (Pollock, 2000:3). Wit h urbanisation and modernisation, some aspects of kava cultivation, preparation and usage were mod ified. For example, it was processed and pre-packaged in bags for mixing at home, usage broadened in t he population, and there was simplification of the associated rituals. The expanding us e with urbanisation was driven by the need of communities to preserve their ties to traditional herit age (Pollock, 2000:7). Today, expatriate communities of Samoans in New Zealand par ticularly prize the whole root, which is treasured if they can get through quarantine (Pollock, 2000 :5). The export market for it was partly driven by expatriate communities keen desire to maintain s ocial and cultural meanings in new settings (Pollock, 2000:7). Kava is considered by anthropologists t o have ritualised significance expressing power, unity and identity. During t he failed Fijia n coup in May 2000 to restore indigenous power in the perceived face of the growing ethnic Indian minority contr ol, the leader (Speight) held nightly kava sessions for the entire two month occupation of the Parliam ent in Suva (Pollock, 2000:4). Pharmaceutical interest German pharmaceutical companies showed interest in Tonga\u0092 s kava in the late l9th century, and again late in 20th century (Pollock, 2000:4). The bioactive compou nd isolated in kava by scientists is kavalactones. They induce relaxation and assist sleep, and c an be effective in reducing stress and anxiety. \u0093These are the desirable qualities by western st andards\u0094 (Pollock, 2000:2). European pharmaceutical companies manufactured the main bioactiv e component into more convenient pills, to meet the new demand in the 1990s for natural alternatives to synthetic biomedical drugs. 363The Kava Growers Guide (SPC, 2001) provides a detailed descri ption of the kava plant. Clinical trials with vity comparable to valium). Kava has have muscle relaxant, anaesthetic, antimycotic, and anxiolytic properties. Kav a products are a natural substitute for these pharmaceuticals, and have fewer side effects and have not be en shown to be addictive or to lead to dose tolerance. Kavalactones have little or no effect on cog nitive performance and visuomotor tests, and do not linger on the breath, but may be detected by a blood o r urine test (Pollock, 2000:6). The chemical make-up of the plant is complex. Fifteen differ ent kavalactones are present, each with a different physiological effect. Each part of the kava plant has a different mix of kavalactones. Kavalactone concentration, taste and action differs accor ding to the part of the plant, soil it was grown in, moisture content, age (generally a minimum of 3 years is r equired for sufficient concentrations), type of preparation, and what is consumed with it. How you p repare the drink and even what you drink afterwards changes the physiological effect (for example, hot water magnifies effects). The harvesting, handling and drying of kava also impacts on quality. Kavalac tones efficacy increases when they are given in combination, and not in islolation. Efficiacy is therefore not based on a single active substan ce, but from a blending of several kavalactones. Scientists have not been able to identify th e mixture required to achieve a particular effect. Naturally produced kavala ctones are st ill much stronger than the synthesised kavalactone, which do not induce the same physical results. This is signif icant as it means synthetically manufactured kavalactones are inferior to the natural sour ce, and it\u0092s difficult to reduce to a specific bioactive compound (and therefore it cannot be easily be pat ented or artificially mass produced) \u0096 a monopoly on production and IPR remains firmly with the tra ditional custodians by a chance of nature. This scientific data demonstrates that the Islander populat ion actually had highly specialised knowledge of particular kava varieties they were selectiv ely cultivating, their efficacy and strengths, and that the rituals of preparation and consumption also ha d a \u0093scientific basis\u0094 designed to enhance potency. Prior to international trade, information on qua lity of the kava was assessed purely from physical examination. A few simple tests could be perform ed, beyond appearance and odour, such as taste. However, trade necessitated standardisation and r egulation. In the 1990s, plants were analysed and categorised according to their particular configurati on of kavalactones, known as a chemotype. Particular varieties of kava could be classified by chemoty pe, which were of different values for pharmaceutical interests. While the chemotype was not important for local use, the p harmaceutical industry in Europe only wanted kava with a particular chemotype and of a particular q uality (which was difficult to standardise considering the natural variation in plants and plant part s). And they only wanted the raw material, to \u0093value add\u0094 and \u0093quality control\u0094 themselves; they did not want to invest in lo cal processing facilities. The profit margins explain this: raw materials account fo r about 8% of the product\u0092s final price, processing adds 17%, wholesale margin is 25% and retail mar gin is 50% (TF, 2002b). Therefore, in only taking the raw material, foreign pharmaceutical fir ms profits are maximised and most kava was sent off-shore for processing. Some products were being pro duced and trialled in Vanuatu, including water and fruit juices infused with kava, and kava confectio nary. The kava plant quickly became a lucrative cash crop. It became a major source of revenue for four Pacific Island nations, and land used for cultivating coco nut was replaced with kava in some places. The Islanders in Pohnpei even encroached upon previously unc ultivated land in the foothills to grow kava, arousing the ire of ecologists and environmentalists (Pollock, 2000:5). However, these nations had few sources of external revenue, and kava represented on e of the only tradeable commodities available. The need for revenue in this case was difficult t o balance with environmental concerns. Their environment presented an advantage as it was an indigenous plant that required unique growing conditions, and they were therefore able to form a natural m onopoly on supply (effectively giving price control to Islanders). Despite that, Hawaii soon attempte d to establish a kava industry cultivating only the preferred chemotypes of the pharmaceutical industry. The Pacific Islands went to considerable 364lengths to inform and guide their growers on the cultivatio n needs according to new industrial demands (including production, harvesting, storing and drying), e videnced by the growers guide in 2001. Local versus global use In moving into global markets, kava raised interesting que stions beyond environmental or sustainable development issues. The use of kava product internationally was in direct contrast and conflict with its customary usage as a ritual summons to the gods, and honori fic of status (Pollock, 2000:1). It was also in forms (pills, powders) and for uses (stress, insomnia, an xiety, depression, premenstrual syndrome) beyond that in the local sphere. Therefore, classifying kav a presented some conceptual difficulties. Is it a plant, drink, supplement, narcotic or medicine? It has to be one or the other to fit into rational-legal frameworks, and each category has associated conditions an d regulatory requirements regarding processing, labelling, testing, quality control and clai ms made. Or is kava simultaneously all of these, and yet none of them \u0096 and really a cultural or religious symbol that transcends all of these uses, but which becomes meani ngless in the global market? Pollock comments that in the original communities, the use could be classified as more religious than medicinal, and notes that \u0093Kava is a drink based on s haring and sociab ility, rather than as a pill to be popped by an individual\u0094(Pollock, 2000:7). Differences in judgements about categorisation were reflected in international variations in classification . In France and Germany, kava was a prescription drug. In the US it was a non-prescription herbal remedy cla ssified as a nutritional supplement (SPC, 2001). Pollock questions the classification of kava as a drug (Poll ock, 2000:6). According to the resource- model, debate around classification (food, plant, herb, dr ug) are about demarcating primary resources. If it is a drug, it has to conform to biomedical conceptual fo undations (i.e. demonstrate causality, mechanisms of action and efficacy) and it is then a biomedic al primary resource and with substantial increases attached to its secondary resources. If in any oth er category, it belongs to TRM/CAM with use as a dietary supplement or food/plant product. The classification of this primary resource therefore depen ds entirely on who is looking at it and what use they have for it: from a biomedical gaze, it was a drug, a psycho-active compound, and it was used, packaged, labelled and promoted as such. But from an Is lander perspective, it was a plant-drink; and the processed products, powders or pills stri pped of the surrounding ritual and social aspects were something very different. Kava powder and pills had differe nt strengths and potencies than the root in raw form, and locals called them NesKava (Pollock, 2000:7 ). The name is a simultaneous allusion to the multinational appropriation and instant fix/commodi fication approach of Western mindsets. As a commodity, it acquired new symbolic uses. It has been trans formed and redefined within a Western, industrial, capitalist, biomedical framework. As Pollock notes, the use of kava was culturally constructed (Pollock, 2000:2), and this served various eco nomic and social interests. Pollock concludes by questioning whether this new market w as just a temporary fad, and if it was sustainable over the longer-term (Pollock, 2000:6). Two par allel markets now existed - the local and the global. These markets were very different, with one based on localised, individual production and preparation and consumed in communal social settings (Sout h); and the other processed, packaged and sold in a variety of forms for prescription or over the cou nter for individual self-medication (North). The market demand in the North was driving local production : of particular kava varieties, with higher and higher quality (strength) and locals had to balance th e new demand with existing land uses and environmental issues, with limited arable land. 365Trade and economic outcomes This question soon proved to be irrelevant. In 2002, the glo bal market collapsed. Trade bans and restrictions were placed on kava based on a single German re port which had linked 32 cases of liver toxicity to kava. The clinical evidence of this was very ten uous, including double-counting and disregarding heavy alcohol consumption, other life-style factors, or the use of biomedical pharmaceuticals (TF, 2002a). In the UK, the Medicines Contro l Agency found \u0093[t]here is no evidence to support a safe dose of kava\u0094 (Hopkins Tanne, 2004). The US had be en concerned about the use of kava from at least 1999 (following a surge of use in 1998) whe n the US National Toxicology Programme announced that they would be testing aloe vera, g inseng, kava, and milk thistle for carcinogenic activity (Gottlieb, 1999). Once reports were made of toxicity, regulators moved quickly and without any warning or advice, almost immediately ceas ed import from the four main kava traders (Vanuatu, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga), and enforced bans, product re calls and issued consumer warnings and alerts. These countries mob ilised to fi ght the trade restrictions. They formed the Pacific Kava Cri sis Committee, and asked Fiji to approach the WTO (as only Fiji had WTO membership, a compulsory pre-requisite to request action) and raise the matter unde r the auspices of provisions for technical barriers to trade or phyto-sanitary agreements. The strateg y also included appealing to the Commonwealth Secretariat, trying to establish a brand fo r kava, obtaining funding in order to develop internationally accepted standards for kava and undertaki ng clinical research so that disputes over quality or safety could be refuted. This needed \u0093expert neut ral consideration\u0094 but a WHO expert suggested that \u0093this approach would not achieve the desire d outcome\u0094 (TF, 2002a). The Secretariat of the Pacific Community requested the WHO to help assess kava a nd establish an expert panel to assess the scientific validity of the adverse claims made (S PC, 2002b). The WHO remained virtually silent on the issue. The WHO Kobe Cen tre lists kava and liver toxicity as an example for the need for safety guidelines in TRM, and kava w as presented as a case study to illustrate safety issues relat ed to herbal products in a WHO Pharmaceuticals Newsletter ( WHO, 2003b). It was reported there that the Centre for Business Development in Brussels commissioned a study to explore the claims of toxicity and found only 4 out o f a total of 76 reported cases were possibly linked to kava consumption. The pharmaceutical processing a nd use of different plant parts may have played a role in toxicity, and it was concluded that unbias ed assessment and evaluation including extraction and processing methods of the kavalactones was needed (WHO, 2003b). The safety issues therefore seemed to point potentially to the pharmaceuti cal handing of the raw product than to the plant itself, and even to the disregard of expert tradition al knowledge regarding concentration, consumption and preparation that had been determined over generations. PUBLIC STATEMENT BY KAVA INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES AT THE PACIFIC HERBS BUSINESS FORUM The Pacific Island Countries are growers and exporters of ka va, and more importantly come from a tradition where kava has been consumed for many hundreds of y ears. Kava is very important to our tradition, to our ceremonies and to our economies. The amount of kava consumed in the Pacific Island Countries greatly exceeds the dose in herbal medicine, yet n o pattern of liver disease has been linked over all those years to kava consumption. We believe that t he medical authorities in some European countries have acted in haste without an adequate scientifi c basis for their decisions. We call upon these authorities to immediately conduct a scientific rev iew of the alleged medical cases that led to this situation We bring to your attention the fact that consum ption in the Pacific Islands is many times the recommended dose in an herbal preparation, but this dose is taken in the form of the natural plant. The actions in Europe will not influence the kava drinkers o f the Pacific Islands but our small vulnerable economies need all the export income that we c an earn. The loss of export sales will impact on our economies and on the subsistence farmers for whom ka va offers one of the few opportunities to generate a cash income (SPC, 2002a). 366Appendix 9: Timeline of significant events (TRM, 1900-1920 Organisations formed to re-establish (rehabilitate) TRM 1919 Site offered to Oriental Medical Science Society for a hos pital and college in Colombo, but they did not have funds to take up offer 1922 Supreme Court ruled that Ayurvedic practitioner could not use title \u0093doctor\u0094 1924 Oriental Science Medical Fund gazetted to send students for Ayurvedic education in India 1927 Constitutional Assembly establish a Committee to develop proposals for the incorporation of TRM into health care system; consider training of practiti oners and medicinal value of remedies 1928 Board of Indigenous Medicine formed 1929 Ayurvedic Hospital, Pharmacy, College of Indigenous Med icine established in Colombo 1935 Ordinance 46: Ayurvedic Medical Council incorporated t o prepare register of practitioners, hold examinations, issue certificates, develop code of reg ulations 1936 Committee appointed to report on Board of Indigenous Medic ine and make recommendations for the administration of the College, H ospital, Pharmacy Late 1930s Local government councils begin to provide free Ayurvedic treatment 1941 Indigenous Medicine Ordinance 17: Board of Indigenous M edicine granted corporate status 1945 Indigenous Medicine Ordinance 27 1947 Commission of Inquiry into Indigenous Medicine \u0096 recommen ded organisation of Ayurvedic sector along lines that resembled biomedical se ctor; found education poor and profession \u0093despised\u0094 and ridiculed.
