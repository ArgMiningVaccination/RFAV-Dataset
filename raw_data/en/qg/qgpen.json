ORIGINAL/OMICRON? ORIGINAL/OMICRON is a vaccine which stimulates the body's natural defenses (immune system). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. It uses a substance called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to carry instructions to cells in the body that are used to make the spike protein that is also on the virus. The cells then make antibodies against the spike protein to help fight off the virus. This will help to protect you against COVID-19 disease. SPIKEVAX BIVALENT ORIGINAL/OMICRON is used as a booster dose to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is given to individuals aged 18 years and older. 2.

Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, a noticeably rapid, strong, or irregular heartbeat and chest pain.

Seek immediate medical attention should these occur. During treatment, you may be at risk of developing certain side effects. It is important you understand these risks and how to monitor for them.
