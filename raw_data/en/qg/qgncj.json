It can address physical illness and emotional or mental disorders, and can also promote high-level wellness and peak performance. The body heals by activating its natural healing energies, by restoring energies that have become weak, disturbed, or out of balance and by eating foods that are charged with natural nutritional energy. Energy Healing Therapy (a.k.a. Energy Medicine) is used to enhance the natural healing ability of the body, to relieve pain; to stop the onset of illness as soon as it begins, stimulate immune function, relieve headaches, release stress, improve memory, enhance digestion, relieve arthritis, neck, shoulder, and low back pain, and cope with electromagnetic pollution.
