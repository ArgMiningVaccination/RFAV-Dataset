They can also optimise skin health. Essential oils, extracted from plants, are thought to possess distinctive properties, which may be used to improve overall emotional and spiritual health imbuing the user with a sense of relaxation and calmness. In a typical, initial, aromatherapy session I will ask questions about previous medical history, general health, wellbeing and lifestyle. This helps me to choose and blend the safest and most appropriate essential oils for the individual. Depending on the value of the treatment I will then blend you an aloe gel blend infused with essential oils and /or a diffusion blend bespoke to your needs. Prior to a clinical aromatherapy session I will get in touch with you, for a brief overview of your requirements. Aromatherapy may be found to be helpful to those wanting to reduce everyday stress and so help with the ability to cope, relax and sleep. There are many valuable properties found in pure essential oils, and I am passionate about utilising these for optimal effect, All my essential oils and carrier oils are sourced from companies belonging to the trade association "}
