Health Service The Indian Health Service (IHS), an Agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the principal Federal Agency charged with the mission of raising the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of American Indians and Alaska Natives to the highest level. The IHS provides comprehensive primary health care and disease prevention services to approximately 2.6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a network of over 600 hospit als, clinics, and health stations on or near Indian reservations. Facilities are predominantly located in rural primary care settings and are managed by IHS, T ribal, and urban Indian health programs. United States Government and Indian Nations The provision of federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives is based on a special relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States. The Indian Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, as well as numerous treaties and court decisions, have affirmed this special relationship and the plenary power of Congress to create statutes that benefit Indian people. Principal among these statutes is the Snyder Act of 1921, which provides the basic authority for health services provided by the F ederal Government to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Indian Health Service and Its Partnership with Tribes In the 1970s, federal Indian policy was re-evaluated leading to adoption of a policy of Indian self- determination. This policy promotes Tribal administration of Federal Indian programs, including health care. Self -Determination does not lessen any federal obligation, but provides an opportunity for Tribes to assume the responsibility of providing health care for their members. IHS partners with Tribes on health care delivery in the context of regular Tribal consultation. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA), as amended, and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976 (IHCIA), as amended, provided new opportunities for the IHS and Tribes to deliver quality and accessible health care. The IHCIA includes specific authorizations such as improvements for urban Indian health programs, Indian health professions programs, and the aut hority to collect from Medicare and Medicaid and other third -party insurers for services rendered at IHS or Tribal facilities. Under the ISDEAA, many Tribes have assumed the administrative and program matic roles previously carried out by the Federal Government. Tr ibes currently administer over half of IHS resources through ISDEAA contracts and compacts. The IHS directly administers the remaining resources and manages programs where Tribes have chosen not to contract or compact health programs. CJ - 1 INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE Fiscal Year 20 22 Budget Submission to Congress Overview of Budget The fiscal year (FY) 2022 Indian Health Service (IHS) Budget encompasses the overall goals of: 1) ensuring comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people; 2) promoting excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization; and 3) strengthening IHS program management and operations in carrying out the agency mission to raise the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of Am erican Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) to the highest level. The Budget conveys the President's commitment to provide high -quality health care services for AI/ANs. The budget reflects the importance of providing health care, consistent with statutory a uthorities, to AI/ANs. This budget also fully supports the IHS Strategic Plan 2019 - 2023 1. In addition, the budget supports the HHS Secretary's priorities to advance health equity, address pressing public health issues such as HIV/Hepatitis C and matern al mortality, and ensure adequate oversight and integrity in the administration of Federal programs. The IHS provides a wide range of clinical, public health, community, and facilities infrastructure services to approximately 2.6 million AI/ANs who are me mbers of 574 federally recognized tribes in 37 states. Comprehensive primary health care and disease prevention services are provided through a network of over 600 hospitals, clinics, and health stations on or near Indian reservations. These facilities are predominately primary care settings and are managed by IHS, t ribal, and urban (I/T/U) Indian health programs. The IHS meets the annual statutory requirement to consult with, and solicit the participation of, AI/AN Tribes and tribal or ganizations in the development of the budget for IHS. Likewise, IHS confers with urban Indian organizations. The consultation and confer input informs the IHS budget formulation process. The core of the agency's formulation process consists of the priorities and recommendations developed in consultation with Tribes through this independent annual budget process led by the National Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup. 2 IHS is strongly committed to this process and it ensures that th e IHS budget is relevant to the health needs and priorities of AI/AN s. The t ribal priorities identified in the consultation process are also instrumental to inform senior officials of other U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies of the health needs of the AI/AN population, so that they have the opportunity to reflect those priorities in the Department's budget requests. The t ribal budget consultation process is a key component of the IHS strategic objectives to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships (Objective 1.2); improve communication within the organization, with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public (Objective 3.1); and secure and effectively manage the assets and resources (Objective 3.2); objectives that advance the IHS mission. Summary of Budget Submission The Administration is committed to fulfilling America's promise to Tribal Nations by taking bold action to redress systemic inequities in Indian Country. The total FY 2022 discretionary 1 https://www.ihs.gov/strategicplan 2 The requirements for consultation are contained in statutes and various Presidential Executive orders including the: Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law (P.L.) 93 -638 as amended; Indian Health Care Improvement Act, P.L. 94 -437, as amended; Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies from President William J. Clinton, April 29, 1994; Presidential Executive Order 13084, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, May 14, 1998; Presidential Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, November 6, 2000; and Presidential Memorandum, Government -to-Government Relationship with Tribal Governments, September 23, 2004. CJ - 2 budget authority for IHS is $8.5 billion, a historic increase of +$2.2 billion, or 36 percent, above FY 2021 enacted. from FY 2021 Enacted include: Current Services: +$207 million to offset the rising cost of providi ng direct health care services, including tribal and federal pay costs ($96 million), medical and non- medical inflation ($24 million), and population growth ($87 million). These resources will help the IHS to maintain services at the FY 2021 levels by sho ring up base operating budgets of IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs in the face of increasing costs. Staffing and Operating Costs for Newly -Constructed Health Care Facilities: +$125 million for staffing of nine newly constructed health care facilities. These funds support the staffing packages for new or expanded facilities, which will expand the availability of direct health care services in areas where existing health care capacity is overextended. Indian Health Services Account Changes from FY 2021 Enacted include: Hospitals & Health Clinics General Program Increase : +$190 million to expand access to direct health care services. These resources will support efforts to reduce health disparities and improve the overall health status for American Indians and Alaska Natives by increasing the availability of health care services in Indian Country. The IHS estimates that these resources will support 39,000 inpatient admissions, and 12 million outpatient visits. Ending HIV and Hepatitis C (Hospitals & Health Clinics): +$22 million, for a total of $27 million, to address the disproportionate impact of HIV, Hepatitis C, and STDs in Indian Country. These additional resources will improve access to testing and treatment for HIV and Hepatitis C, and prevent new HIV infections by increasing the availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). National Community Health Aide Program (CHAP) (Hospitals & Health Clinics) : +$20 million, for a total of $25 million, to support the expansion of CHAP to the lower 48 states. These additional resources would support the training, certifying, and hiring of health aides, as well as national program management activities. Assessments (Hospitals & Health Clinics) : +$27 million to offset the increasing costs of central assessments charged to the IHS since FY 2014. To address the growing costs of shared services at HHS, the IHS has delayed hiring and investments in critical systems, working to shield direct health care ser vices to the maximum extent possible. However, the IHS is now at a point where it can no longer sacrifice oversight and management of national health programs to absorb these rising costs. Electronic Health Record Modernization : +$250 million, for a total of $285 million, to improve the quality of health care in Indian Country, and health status of American Indians and Alaska Natives by modernizing the IHS Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. These resources will support efforts to stabilize the aging IHS EHR while modernization is underway, and support the initial build activities for the EHR environment, as well as initial site transition planning. Dental Health: +$50 million, to expand access to dental health services in American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The IHS estimates that these funds will support CJ - 3 an additional 1.1 million dental health services across Indian Country. Opioids Grants (Alcohol & Substance Abuse): +$5 million, for a total of $15 million, to expand access to opioid use disorder prevention, treatment, recovery, and aftercare services in Indian Country, as part of the HHS- wide initiative to combat opioid use disorder. Purchased and Referred Care: +$190 million to support additional contract health care services that are not available in IHS or Tribal health facilities, providing an estimated 8,312 additional inpatient admissions, 195,465 additional outpatient visits, and 10,086 additional patient travel trips. Indian Health Care Improvement Fund: +$243 million to provide additional health services and address resource disparities across the Indian health system. Urban Health: +$34 million to increase funding for urban Indian health programs to $100 million. These funds will provide additional culturally competent direct health care services for American Indians and Alaska Natives living in urban areas. Indian Health Professions: +$25 million to offer additional IHS Scholarship and Loan Repayment awards, bolstering recruitment and retention efforts through these two high demand programs. Direct Operations: +$23 million to support the efficient and effective administration and oversight of national and Area- level functions like financial management, human resources, grants management, acquisitions, ISDEAA contracting and compacting administration, contract support costs and tribal lease payments administration , performance management, and other administrative supports and systems. Indian Health Facilities Account Changes from FY 2021 Enacted include: Maintenance and Improvement: +$50 million, for a total of $223 million, for major projects to reduce the Backlog of Essential Maintenance and Repair (BEMAR), as well as routine maintenance and repair to sustain the condition of federal and Tribal healthcare facilities buildings, and environmental compliance projects to meet changing healthcare delivery needs. Sanitation Facilities Construction: +$150 million, for a total of $351 million to improve the potable water supply, wastewater disposal, and solid waste infrastructure for nearly 38,184 eligible American Indian and Ala ska Native homes. Health Care Facilities Construction: +$266 million, for a total of $5 26 million, to support the remaining projects on the 1993 IHS Health Care Facilities Construction Priority List, and to construct additional Staff Quarters and Small Ambulatory Facilities . These health care facilities will improve access to direct health care services. Facility & Environmental Health Support: +$13 million, for a total of $300 million, to support an extensive array of real property, health care facilities and staff quarters construction, maintenance and operation services, as well as community and institutional environmental health, injury prevention, and sanitation facilities construction services. CJ - 4 Equipment: +$71 million, for a total of $101 million, for maintenance and upgrades for existing medical equipment, and procurement of new medical equipment to replace units that are at the end of their useable lifecycle at IHS and Tribal healthcare facilities. FY 2023 Advance Appropriation For the first time, the FY 2022 President's Budget proposes advance appropriations for the IHS at $9 billion in discretionary budget authority for FY 2023. Advance Appropriations will protect IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs from the impact of government shutdowns and the uncertainty of the annual appropriations process. Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, which receive substantial mandatory funding, and the Veterans Health Administration, which receives an advance appropriation, IHS is currently funded primarily through annual discretionary appropriations. Advance appropriations will provide s table, predictable funding, allowing IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs to effectively and efficiently manage budgets, coordinate care, and improve health outcomes for American Indians and Alaska Natives. FY 2023 Contract Support Costs and Section 105( l) Lease Agreements In addition, the Budget propos es reclassification of the appropriations for Contract Support Costs and section 105(l) lease agreements beginning in FY2023. Specifically, the Budget proposes that, beginning in FY 2023, these accounts will continue to be funded through the Appropriations process but will be reclassified as mandatory funding. At present, Congress provides f unding for these costs through an indefinite discretionary appropriation. These costs are more appropriately funded from mandatory appropriations, because they arise f rom the operation of law . CJ - 5 Overview of Agency Performance The IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023 sets the direction of the agency over the next five years and includes a mission and vision statement, three goals, and eight objectives.1 IHS's strategic goals are focused on: access to care, quality of care, and strengthening management and operations. The FY 2022 budget supports the three IHS s trategic goals and improvement of AI/AN health outcomes in some of the following ways:2 Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people. Objective 1.1: Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce. The Indian Health Professions narrative includes several measures related to recruitment and retention. ( HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 (HHS SP) Objective 1.4, Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs.) Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships. IHS collaborates with tribes and Urban programs in the delivery of healthcare services, see the Self-Governance and Urban Health narratives for an overview. ( HHS SP Objective 1.3, Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options.) Objective 1.3: Incr ease access to quality health care services. In FY 2022, IHS anticipates the opening of two newly constructed healthcare facilities. (HHS SP Objective 1.3) The IHS budget provides critical support in meeting targets for clinical measures, including, maintaining or exceeding targets for childhood and adult immunizations; breastfeeding rates ; critical health screenings; access to dental services and preventive procedures such as, dental sealants and topical fluorides; and several diabetes care measures. (HHS SP Objective 2.2, Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions.) Funding for Alcohol and Substance Abuse and Mental Health supports five screening measures to promote early intervention. (HHS SP Objective 2.3, Reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders through prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery support.) Goal 2: To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization. Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization. By December 31, 2021, IHS ambulatory care facilities are required to obtain Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) certification/ recognition . The PCMH models of care promote care standardization across the agency. ( HHS SP Objective 1.3.) Objective 2.2: Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Culturally appropriate care and best practices are routinely provided and shared across the Indian health care system, the budget narratives include several examples. (HHS SP Objective 2.1: Empower people to make informed choices for healthier living.) Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations. Objective 3.1: Improve communications within the organization with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public. 1 See the \"IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023 Goals and Objectives\" diagram at the end of this section . The IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 is Strategic Plan FY 2019 with the HHS Strategic Plan FY IHS Strategic Plan Strategic Plan and IHS Strategic Plan Crosswalk , the plans are aligned according to strategic objectives. The IHS FY 2021 budget support s the IHS and HHS Strategic Plan objectives, as referenced in parentheses and italics. CJ - 6IH S, tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations provide critical health care services. IHS continues to strengthen tribal consultation and urban confer efforts to ensur e s takeholders have the opportunity to provide input and are informed of system or policy changes . (HHS SP Objective 1.3.) Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources . IHS continues to improve business processes to inform decision making and strengthen partnerships to maximize patient health care options. (HHS SP Objective 1.3.) Objective 3.3: Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions. In FY 2022 , IHS will continue Electronic Health Record (EHR) system modernization efforts tha t w ill ultimately replace IHS's current m edical, h ealth, and b illing records s ystems. The informati on t echnology infrastructure is central to management and operations of the health care system. (HHS SP Objective 5.3, O ptimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency a nd e nable innovation to advance program mission goals.) T he FY 2022 budget request provides critical support in assuring the availability and expansion of health care services, assuring the quality of services, and in providing operational support for the Indian health care system. In addition to the above referenced budget measures, IHS has implemented the following performance reporting and management processes to monitor agency progress. P erformance Reporting T he IHS budget measures support the agency's strategic goals and objectives and are focused on monitoring population health (clinical measures) and strategies to assess program trends and management (non- clinical measures). The FY 2022 budget includes sev eral budget related measures as reported in each narrative and in the outcomes and outputs tables, evaluation results may also be reported in the narrative sections. For FY 2020 the IHS is reporting an \"interim result\" for each clinical GPRA/GPRAMA measure, pending verification of final patient registration data. I HS reports valid and reliable aggregated clinical measures using a centralized reporting system to meet the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and GPRA Modernization Act (GPRA MA) requirements . IHS annually reports GPRA/ GPRAMA clinical measure results. Tribes administer over 62.1 percent of IHS resources through I SDEAA contracts and compacts and may choose to participate in IHS GPRA/ GPRAMA performance reporting. Many Tribal programs operate EHR systems that differ from the IHS EHR, Resource and Patient Management System ( RPMS ). S ince 2002, IHS has reported electronic population level results for GPRA/GPRAMA clinical measures. Over time, as more Tribes assumed responsibility of providing health care for their members and adopted non-RPMS EHR systems , the agency's clinical performance measure results primarily reflected IHS programs. Prior to FY 2018, IHS clinical measure results reflected only RPMS data as non- RPMS data could not be verified or validated for budget- related performance reporting . Beginning in FY 2018, the IHS clinical results were reported from a new system, the Integrated Data Collection System Data Mart (IDCS DM ). 3 The IDCS DM provides those Tribes using non -RPMS EHRs the opportunity to report data for GPRA/GPRAMA purposes ; reporting is optional for Tribes . The IDCS DM calculates measure results using any data (RPMS, non-RPMS or Fiscal Intermediary) submitted to the IHS National Data Warehouse 3 The IDCS DM uses all data exported to the NDW, including non -RPMS tribal and urban data . Budget measures previously reported from RPMS cannot be compare d to IDCS DM results because: IDCS DM standardizes the use of user population estimates as the denominator for clinical GPRA/GPRAMA measures, and the reporting year changes from July 1 -June 30 (GPRA/GPRAMA year) to October 1 -September 30 (to match the user population estimate report year). CJ - 7 (NDW) and assures reporting of valid and reliable clinical measure results. The FY 2020 clinical GPRA/GPRAMA measure results are reported from the IDCS DM and reflect aggregated Federal, T ribal, and urban (I/T/U) results. Tribal programs have the option to participate in IDCS DM reporting and aggregated results include participating Tribal programs. The FY 2022 budget request includes anticipated targets based on most recent year results and projected funding . Performance Management IHS cascades performance goals and objectives and performance -related metrics agency- wide, and aligns them with the agency's strategic plan. Specific measures cascade from senior executive performance plans to those of subordinate managers and supervisors. From there , they cascade into employee performance plans, which ensures that performance of all employees relates to key agency performance objectives. Agency leadership periodically reviews progress in meeting these agency performance objectives, holding regular discussions with senior executives to identify challenges to success and determine feasible solutions. Agency leadership then implements those solutions, making specific adjustments or taking corrective actions that eliminate or minimize obstacles preventing the achievement of desired results. The connection between performance objectives, performance measures, and employee accountability enables agency leadership to direct the efforts of the workforce more accurately, and to make more informed and effective decisions. The impact is greater success in meeting the full array of agency mission requirements. COVID -19 Impact During FY 2020, the Indian health care system has experienced fewer in -person visits as many patients postponed prevention and health maintenance appointments to reduce coronavirus (COVID-19) exposure risk. Several sites also transitioned from in -person primary care to virtual care or reduced services to minimize the risk of COVID -19 transmission, and prioritize COVID -19 testing and response. While patients with acute illnesses or the need for emergency care are still seen at IHS facilities, many patients may be unable or unwilling to have in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic due to limited services available or to reduce personal risk. The changes in health care delivery may impact clinical GPRA measures results for FY 2020. T he IHS has several examples of how the system modified its delivery system to address COVID -19, including: Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer: Consistent with agency policy on tribal consultation and urban confer , the IHS communicated regularly and shared critical information with I/T/Us. Weekly Indian Country COVID-19 Update calls with tribal and Urban Indian Organization leaders call hosted by the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Federal partn ers began March 5, 2020. On April 7, 2020, the IHS launched weekly COVID-19 Update calls for UIO Leaders. Call frequency for tribal and Urban Indian Organization leaders has fluctuated from weekly to monthly based on the requirements for COVID -19 situati onal awareness in Indian country. Telehealth Expansion: In March 2020, IHS formed a COVID-19 Telehealth Team that provides outreach to areas and guidance to healthcare providers. IHS expanded its use of telehealth across federal facilities to provide p atients with the opportunity to stay home and reduce their risk of infection and keep health care workers safe. IHS released interim guidance to virtual check -in and visit for adults with diabetes. The Increase Tele-behavioral Health Encounters Nationally among American Indians and Alaska Natives is an HHS GPRAMA measure reported in the HHS Annual Performance Plan and Report. Demand for these services has steadily increased. Tele- behavioral visits in the IHS experienced such an increase in services that the IHS revised its FY 2021 target from 26,647 tele -behavioral health encounters to a target of 46,000 encounters. CJ - 8 Clinical and Administrative Guidance: IHS issued clinical and administrative guidance and recommendation documents to support the delivery of timely, quality, and safe care. IHS focused on sustained care in the Indian health system through developing interim guidance documents. The Division of Oral Health distributed interim guidance for dental clinic operations beyond emergency care as well as for re -opening dental clinic operations. Interim guidance documents were prepared for optometry clinics. Interim guidance was prepared for the role and response of Community Health Representatives/Community Health Workers and later for their virtua l home visits during the COVID -19 pandemic. Code Updates: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) added new reimbursement codes for telehealth and teledentistry visits, those codes were added to measure logic definitions so that facilities using those codes could count those visits.

SUMMARY OF THE BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2022 Indian Health Service (IHS) Budget submission for Clinical Services is $5.2 billion, which is $1.3 billion above the FY 2021 Enacted level. This funding level includes additional resources for: Current Services (+$169 million), Staffing of N ew Facilities (+$11 0 million) , Electronic Health Record (+ $250 million), Hospitals and Health Clinics ( +$190 million) , The HIV/Hepatitis C Initiative (+$22 million), National Community Health Aide Program Expansion (+$20 million), Assessments ( +$27 mill ion), Dental Health (+$50 million), Opioid Grants (+$5 million), Purchased/Referred Care (+$ 190 million), and the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (+$243 million). The budget narratives that follow this summary include detailed explanations of the request. Hospitals and Health Clinics , supports essential personal health services and community based disease prevention and health promotion services. Health services includ e: inpatient care, routine and emergency ambulatory care ; and medical support s ervices including laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, medical records, physical therapy, and other services . Specialized programs are conducted to address : diabetes; maternal and child health ; youth services; communicable diseases includi ng human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune and hepatitis; women's and men's health; geriatric health ; disease surveillance ; and healthcare quality improvement. Electronic Health Record (EHR) , holds an extremely high degree of mission criticality given the ability to provide much -anticipated clinical and administrative capabilities used in modern systems for the delivery of timely and impactful healthcare. Expected benefits from adopting and implementing a modernized or new system include but are not limited to improved patient safety, improved patient outcomes, better disease management, enhanced population health, improved clinical quality measures, opioid tracking, patient data exchange, third party revenue generation, agency performance reporting, etc. By identifying and properly selecting the best match for proposed system capabilities, the system will support the IHS mission. Additionally, the IHS aims to obtain interoperability CJ - 66with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense , tribal and urban Indian health programs, academic affiliates, and community partners, many of whom are on different Health Information Technology platforms. The IHS must consider an integrated EHR system solution that will allow for a meaningful i ntegration to create a system that serves I HS/Tribal/Urban beneficiaries in the best possible way. Dental Health , supports preventive care , basic care, and emergency care, with approximately 90 percent of services covering basic and emergency care. Basic services are prioritized over more complex rehabilitative care such as root canals, crowns and bridges, dentures, and surgical extractions . The demand for dental treatment remains high due to high dental caries rate in American Indian and Alaska Native ( AI/AN) children; however, a continuing emphasis on community oral health promotion and disease prevention is essential to impact long-term improvement of the oral health of AI/AN people. Mental Health , supports a community- oriented clinical and preventive mental health service program that provides outpatient mental health and related services, crisis triage, case management, prevention programming, and outreach services. Alcohol and Substance Abuse , supports an integrated behavioral health approach to collaboratively reduce the incidence of alcoholism and other drug dependencies in AI/AN communities. Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) , supports the purchase of essential health care serv ices not available in IHS and Tribal healthcare facilities including inpatient and outpatient care, routine emergency ambulatory care, transportation, specialty care services (mammograms, colonoscopies, etc.), and medical support services (e.g., laboratory , pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, physical therapy, etc.). The demand for PRC remains high as the cost of medical care increases. The PRC program continues to emphasize adherence to medical priorities, enrolling patients in alternate resources available to them (such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance), negotiating discounted rates with medical providers, and implementing improvements recommended by Tribes and oversight authorities. The majority of clinical services funds are provided to 12 Area (regional) Offices that distribute resources, monitor and evaluate activities, and provide administrative and technical support to approximately 2.6 million AI/ANs through a network of over 600 hospitals, clinics, and health stations on or near Indian reservations 1 in service areas that are rural, isolated, and underserved. Performance Summary Table The following long- term performance measures are considered overarching because they are accomplished through a variety of programs and activities in the IHS Services budget. 1 The over 60 0 number represents actual health care facilities that can be found in the OP DIV-Specific section of the Fiscal Year 2021 Congressional Justification publication titled: \"Number of Service Units and Facilities Operated by IHS and Tribes, October 1, 201 8.\" CJ - 67 OUTPUTS/OUTCOMES Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2021 Target FY population (Outcome) FY 2010: 93.7 Target: Not Defined (Target Not In Place) Not Defined Not Defined Maintain 71 Childhood Weight Control: Proportion of children, ages 2 -5 years with a BMI at or above the 20 20: Defined (Historical Actual) Not Defined 22.6% N/A 2 Interim result.

The Indian Health Service (IHS ) provides medical and surgical inpatient care , routine and emergency ambulatory care, and medical support services including laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, medical records, and physical therapy. The IHS direct health care services supports the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 and integrates the Department's Strategic Goal to protec t the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018- 2022, Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Empower people to make informed choices for healthier living , 2.2 P revent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions , 2.3 Reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders through prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery , & 2.4 Prepare for and respond to public health emergencies) . The IHS and tribes primarily serve small, rural populations with primary medical care and community health services, relying on the private sector for much of the secondary and most of the tertiary m edical care needs. Some IHS and tribal hospitals provide secondary medical services such as ophthalmology, orthopedics, infectious disease, emergency medicine, radiology, general and gynecological surgery, and anesthesia. The IHS system of care is unique in that personal health care services are integrated with community health services. The program includes public/community health programs targeting health conditions disproportionately affecting AI/AN populations such as diabetes, maternal and child health, and communicable diseases including influenza, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ), and viral hepatitis. The health status of AI/AN people has improved significantly in the past 60 years since IHS' s inception . However, CJ - 69AI/AN people born today have a life expectancy th at is 5.5 years less than the U.S. all races population, 73.0 years to 78.5 years, respectively .1 More than 60 percent of the H&HC budget is transferred under P.L. 93-638 contracts or compacts to tribal governments or tribal organizations that design and manage the delivery of individual and community health services through 22 hospitals, 280 health centers, 79 health stations , 59 Alaska village clinics, and six school health centers. The remainder of the H&HC budget is managed by direct federal programs that provide health care at the service unit and community level. The federal system consists of 24 hospitals (23 hospitals have emergency departments), 50 health centers, 24 health stations , and 12 school health centers. Collecting, analyzing, and interpreting health information is done through a network of t ribally - operated epidemiology centers in collaboration with a national IHS coordinating center leading to the identification of health conditions as well as promoting interventions. Information technology supports personal health services (including the Electronic Health Record and telemedicine) and public health initiatives (such as Baby Friendly Hospitals and Improving Patient Care ) that are primarily funded through the H&HC budget (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018- 2022, Goal 4, Objective 4.1 Foster sound, sustained advances in the sciences). The H&HC funds provide critical support for direct health care services, ensures comprehensive, culturally appropriate services, provides available and accessible personnel , promotes excellence and quality through implemented quality improvement strategies, and strengthens the IHS program management and operations to raise the health status of AI/AN populations to the highest level ( IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people; Goal 2: To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization; Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 1: Reform, strengthen, and modernize the Nation's healthcare system; Goal 2: Protect the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play; Goal 3: Strengthen the economic and social well-being of Americans across the lifespan; Goal 4: Foster sound, sustained advances in the sciences; Goal 5: Promote effective and efficient management and stewardship. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The following are examples of specific activities funded through H&HC that improve the quality of services throughout the IHS healthcare system: Office of Quality - Established in FY 2019, the IHS Office of Quality (OQ) has made significant quality and patient safety improvements across the Agency. The OQ has three divisions: 1) Quality Assurance; 2) Patient Safety and Clinical Risk Management; and, 3) Innovation and Improvement that lead the work on oversight of policy and accreditation standards, implementation of quality improvement strategies, and monitoring accountability of federally- operated facilities. The establishment of the OQ met the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization; IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3 To Strengthen IHS program management and operations; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. 1 Data comparing the AI/AN population to the U.S. general population are documented and updated annually by the IHS. CJ - 70 The novel coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic has disproportionately impacted the AI/AN population IHS serves and has caused the Agency to rethink and redesign the traditional approaches to providing health care to adapt to circumstances changed by the pandemic. The IHS rapidly redesign ed service delivery methods and is leveraging local, tribal, state and federal resources and guidance to safely and efficiently meet new challenges and health care needs of AI/AN people while maintaining its commitment to the mission of the IHS . The OQ has led this redesign by staffing the planning s ection for the IHS Incident Command Structure (ICS); developing and disseminating three Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for COVID-19 response, contact tracing, and recovery; collected situation and resource status information, analyzed it, and process ed for use in developing the Agency's action plan . The planning section supports daily ICS operations, disseminating of information through daily response documents like the Incident Action Plan, Common Operating Picture, and situation reports; as well as in formal briefings and map and status board displays. The OQ also leveraged its clinical experts in drafting and approving clinical and administrative guidance documents. In FY 2020, the Agency distributed over 150 guidance documents on items such as managing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), use of medical equipment, and triaging patients. The OQ provided The Joint Commission (TJC), Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) , and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) accreditation updates on a monthly basis to provide awareness of changing standards and assist facilities to maintain compliance with updated and new standards and accreditation requirements during the pandemic. In addition, the OQ completed 35 Infection Control Assessment and Response (ICAR) hospital assessments at IHS and tribal locations in part nership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These assessments assess and identify any infection control gaps and provide remedial resources. The continued work of the OQ to address COVID- 19 meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization; IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3 To Strengthen IHS program management and operations; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Strategic Objective 1. 2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. Other OQ FY 2020 activities and accomplishments include the following: Quality Assurance - The Division of Quality Assurance focused intently on ensuring quality of care in IHS facilities through external accreditation and certification. The OQ supports all IHS facilities through collaboration, assistance, and participation in the facility Mock Survey process. Mock surveys use the accreditation standards to evaluate facility preparedness to ensure a state of continual readiness to achieve accreditation standards to provide high quality safe patient care. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. The OQ supported and provided assistance to IHS facilities in all 12 IHS Areas to achieve and maintain The Joint Commission ( TJC) and Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Centers ( AAAHC ) accreditation standards and Centers for Medicare and Medicai d (CMS ) regulations for IHS Hospitals, Health Centers, Behavioral Health facilities, and Critical Assess Hospital s (CAH). The IHS has also directed that all ambulatory care facilities attain Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) designation by the end of calendar year 2021. In FY 2020, 18 surveys occurred in IHS facilities, including: 3 TJC hospital surveys, one CAH survey, 12 CMS CJ - 71certification or CMS Infection Control surveys in ten hospitals, and 1 AAAHC Health Center survey. As of September 2020, 100 percent of all IHS hospitals and CAHs have achieved and maintain ed CMS conditions of participation, 21 of 24 hospitals and CAHs have TJC accreditation, and 12 of 24 hospitals and CAHs have PCMH designation, and 90 percent of the IHS Health Centers and 50 pe rcent of IHS hospital with ambulatory care services have attained PCMH designation. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Strategic Objective 1.3, Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options. In addition, t he IHS has modernized its credentialing and privileging process through the implementation of ASM Products credentialing and privileging software, which is being used in all Areas to facilitate the hiring and ongoing monitoring of qualified practitioners. The credentialing process evaluates the qualifications and practice history of a provider such as education, training, residency, and licensing. Privileging authorizes a healthcare practitioner to practice within a specified scope of patient care services. The OQ managed the rollout and training of the new software system, and continuously monitored processes and system changes for improvements. In FY 2020, the system completed a monthly check on an average of 3,000 active medical staff provider credentials, flagging any negatively changed items. The system also processed nearly 800 initial appointment applications and roughly 1,500 reappointment applications. This improved process provides real time situational awar eness to governing boards on providers. The automation of the software also funnels information to Area and IHS Leadership allowing oversight capability. This is a critical effort in facilitating the timely hiring of appropriately qualified providers and ensuring patient safety. The improved credentialing and privileging process meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.3 Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5, St rategic Objective 5.3, Optimize information technology investments to improve efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals. Patient Safety and Clinical Risk Management - In FY 2020, the IHS transitioned to the IHS Safety Tracking & Response (I- STAR), a system for reporting adverse event s. The I -STAR replaced the legacy WebCident platform, a system originally developed in 2002 that was intended for tracking worker injury reporting. After a phased rollout of I -STAR , including a pilot session , the system has now successfully launched across the Agency offering improved reporting of patient safety data and increased analytic capability . The OQ ma naged the rollout and continues to monitor the implementation of I- STAR. This activity meet s the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2: Objective 2.2, Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1: Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. The OQ also focused on increasing infection control capacity. The Infection Prevention and Control program developed resources for CEO oversight of infection control programs and presented on common infection control accreditation findings and worked with the I- STAR team to incorporate infection control breaches and adverse incidents within the new reporting system. The Infection Prevention and Control c oordinator facilitated American Hospital Association Certified Healthcare Environmental Services (EVS) Training (CHEST) (Train the Trainer) workshop for 50 multidisciplinary IHS staff throughout the IHS (February 4-6). Training promoted standardization of evidence based infection control best management practices throughout t he IHS. This is the first EVS certification training deployed nationally within the CJ - 72IHS. The OQ also provided guidelines to all IHS Area facilities to improve patient safety and compliance with new and upcoming US Pharmacopeia (USP) requirements for comp ounding sterile preparations. In addition, the OQ has collaborated with the CDC to provide infection control training to IHS areas to help meet industry standards for infection control, including sterilization and decontamination of surgical instruments u sed in patient care within hospitals, ambulatory care and dental facilities. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strate gic Plan Goal 1 , Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. Innovation and Improvement - The Division of Innovation and Improvement has increased quality improvement capacity within the Agency. A survey was developed to assess the experience and satisfaction with the care provided. This Patient Experience of Care Survey was established to dev elop a standardized survey instrument for use at all IHS health care facilities. These anonymous surveys are administered and the results analyzed individually by each IHS healthcare facility to determine what improvements, if any, are required to improve the patient experience. Expansion of the number of facilities implementing this tool will continue throughout FY 2021. By directly gathering the opinions and experiences of our patients, the survey directly supports improved quality of care provided by the IHS. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2: Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1: Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. The OQ continued implement ation of the accelerated model for improvement (AmiTM) improvement science framework, and supported the training Healthcare Improvement Professionals (HIP) to support quality improvement initiatives throughout the IHS areas. There are 45 HIP s implementing various improvement projects and AmiTM and as of September 2020, over 120 quality improvement projects have been started or completed across the Agency. The projects focus on improving both administrative and clinical processes, all project information is housed on a server that allows for sharing across the Agency resulting in increased transparency of new best practices. This activity meets the IHS St rategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2., Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization; IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and, the HHS Stra tegic Plan Goal 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. The OQ manages the Innovations Project , which was implemented for the 4th year on Oct ober 1, 2020. The purpose of the project is to develop and implement quality improvement innovation initiatives to address the social determinants of health in AI/AN communities. These projects strengthen the link between clinics and communities and explore the application of quality impro vement science to address one or more social determinants of health in education, transportation, housing or employment to improve community health. 2020 Innovations Project Awardees: Ft. Hall Service Unit, Improving the Lives of Patients with Uncontrolled Diabetes through Collaborative Practice with Continuous Glucose Monitoring and Patient Focus Groups; Wellpinit Service Unit: WSU Telehealth Collaboration with BIA Spokane Indian Reservat ion; Oklahoma City Indian Clinic: Expanding Women's Health Services by Creating a Comprehensive Women's Health Center . Funded project teams will use the Ami model to guide and implement their projects. Ami is a proven quality improvement method support ed by the Office of Quality that uses an Actionable Improvement Plan and Charter to accelerate results due at the end of the project year . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2 , Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization and CJ - 73IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 , Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Improving Patient Care (IPC) Program - The purpose of the IPC Program is to promote the development and application of the quality improvement processes and to promote the implementation of the PCMH model of care to improve the health and wellness of AI/AN people. The IPC program provides a model of collaborative learning to develop proficiency in quality improvement. Data management and analysis are used to drive improvements. Success will be measured by achievement of clinical and process industry -benchmarks, as well as ultimate recognition or certification of participating sites as PCMHs. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Strategic Objective 1.3, Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choic es of care and service options. In 2020, the IPC program has provided 1,000 subscriptions to the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Open School to support I/T/U facility staff in their quality improvement efforts with enrollment of over 900 staff. The IPC program has awarded over 3,400 Continuing Education Units (CEU) and over 310 Certificates in Quality and Patient Safety for I/T/U staff to date. In 2019, the IHS implemented a web based collaborative learning environment , the Quality Portal, to support quality improvement and PCMH information dissemination and knowledge exchange. The portal includes subscription and notification settings, integration of a calendar invitation, the ability for the IHS staff to create \"affinity groups\" to manage quality improvement work , and the ability to upload resources when replying to a request in the Community Exchange. In FY 2020, there was an increase of 4 2 percent of its membership from FY 2019 and portal members have viewed over 845 times resources in the Quality Portal, averaging over 80 views a month of those resources, and members have uploaded over 200 resources to the portal. The IPC Program completed a gap analysis and identified multiple process improvement and functionality enhancements for development in FY 2020 and has develop ed a process to further improve the costumer experience of the active members of the portal utilizing the Community Exchange . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal : Objective 2 .1, Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization; Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. The IPC program supports I/T/U facilities in providing them with the tools and resources needed to determine when a change is an improvement and to monitor the spread and scale-up of change using PCMH measures. The IPC program continues to develop an ambulatory care measure set integrated in the health information system in collaboration with the IHS Office of Information Technology (OIT). There are currently 21 approved measures and in FY 2020, the majority of these measures were available in our population health management tool (iCare) for facilities to view, monitor, and use to guide quality improvement measures. The IPC program in FY 2020 worked with IHS OIT to enable IHS and Tribal practices participating in the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) model offered through the CMS Innovation Center and in the CMS MIPS program to report on required electronic clinical quality measures at a practice level. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization; Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1: Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. CJ - 74Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) - In January 2020, IHS established a National Compliance Program in the immediate Office of the Director overseen by the IHS Chief Compliance Officer in the new Compliance Program. ERM drives the A123 annual internal control assessment, and also the completion of HQ Oversight Reviews of each IHS Area, each year. In FY 2020, IHS identified two programs that received CARES Act funding and performed risk assessments, Purchase Referred Care (PRC) and Telehealth assessing both programs as low risk for improper payments. The ERM program at IHS also addressed the impact of the COVI D-19 public health emergency on the Agency. As part of the OMB A-123 Appendix A Self- Assessments, program offices assessed additional questions specifically geared to risk associated with addressing the COVID-19 public health emergency. Selected program offices assessed whether the public health emergency had led to the implementation of new controls to mitigate risk of the COVID- 19 health emergency or if the operating effectiveness of existing controls had been impacted. The COVID -19 public health emerg ency was assessed to have a low impact on the ERM Program at IHS. To address the pandemic, IHS contracted for a special ERM project to prepare a Recovery Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and a Contact Tracing CONOPS for the AI/AN community. The se documents provide a compilation of information from the CDC, National Institute of Health (NIH), and other sources that provide safety recommendations and best practices for people and communities to follow in order to combat COVID-19 and keep the AI/AN population safe by minimizing risk of infection from COVID-19. IHS also continues to focus on data for improved reporting, collection, and decision making during this health crisis and future crises. In FY 2020, IHS selected three risks to begin risk response planning; Hospital Accreditation, Retention, and Quality of Care. IHS engaged senior leaders to conduct qualitative and quantitative research to uncover root causes for these risks, validate and prioritize these root causes and develop response action plans t o address them. Response tactics were then aligned to those root causes, emphasizing that one tactic could help address multiple root causes. Overall, there were over 80 recommended actions across three risk response plans, enabling IHS to take action and address its top risks. Also in FY 2020, IHS established the Quality Assurance Risk Management Committee (QARMC) to provide senior level oversight and management of complex, adverse patient safety events and administrative matters involving fraud, waste, abuse, and employee misconduct within IHS-operated hospitals and clinics; and perform Agency -wide clinical and administrative risk management to identify systematic changes needed to improve the quality of health care services and IHS- operated hospitals an d clinics. The QARMC is a component of the overall ERM governance structure and is intended to ensure enterprise- wide accountability and effectiveness of those internal and external reporting systems, necessary management responses, and swift and effective corrective action . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.2, Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5, Strategic Objective 5.1, Ensure responsible financial management. Patient Wa it Times - the IHS continued monitoring wait time standards for both the Emergency Department (ED) and Primary Care Visits. The ED wait time consists of two standards: 1) Median Time from ED Arrival Time to ED Departure Time for discharged ED patients of 120 minutes or less; and 2) \" Left Without Being Seen \" rate of two ( 2)% or less (both measures align with industry standards). Access to the e- dashboards and reports for Wait Times Primary Care Visit went live on June 10, 2019 and monthly reports continue t o be generated to monitor progress. The ED wait time standards automation process (access to the e- dashboard for select CJ - 75IHS stakeholders) went live on June 24, 2019. Subsequently, ED Communication Memorandum and process flow were sent to Area Directors and Chief Medical Officers and monthly reports are also being generated and disseminated for ED wait times. Finally on July 2, 2020, IHS provided access to the Primary Care Visit e- dashboard for all stakeholders that were able to access a PDF report. Since t he ED wait time went live, there has been improvement and both wait time standards continue to be monitored. Improving patient wait times ensures that timely primary care is available and accessible to IHS patients; this is a direct response to the GAO rec ommendation to improve oversight of patient wait times which has since been closed as of March 2020. In addition, in 2020 there was increased collaboration with the Assistance Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) to review the wait time's data from January 2017- January 2020. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. Nursing - Nursing represents the largest category of health care providers in the Indian h ealth system and has a major impact on patient safety and health care outcomes. Nurses ar e actively engaged in the transformation of the health care system by placing more emphasis on prevention, wellness, and coordination of care. As part of the Let's Move! In Indian Country (LMIC), the Indian Health Service (IHS) launched the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) in 2011. This IHS initiative promotes breastfeeding to reduce the risk that children will develop obesity, diabetes, and other obesity- related conditions in the future. 1 The BFHI is a quality improvement initiative to increase breastfeeding (BF) initiation and duration, thereby creating a healthy start in life and preventing childhood obesity. Exclusive BF protects against obesity and type II diabetes, conditions to which American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are particularly prone. The BFHI initiative requires the following: establish a written BF policy; train all staff in the skills necessary to implement the policy; inform pregnant women of the benefits and management of BF; assist mothers initiate BF within 1 hour of birth; show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation; give infants no food or drink other than breast- milk, unless medically indicated; allow mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day (rooming in); encourage breastfeeding on demand; give no pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding infants; and, foster the establishment of BF support groups and refer mothers to them upon discharge. Ten IHS federally operated obstetrical (OB) hospitals are designated as Baby -Friendly. Baby Friendly designated facilities are required to be surveyed and re- designated every five years. The following obstetric hospitals have successfully completed Baby Friendly Re-designation assessment: Claremore Indian Hospital, Phoenix Indian Medical Center, Quentin N. Burdick Memorial Health Care Facility, Zuni Comprehensive Health Center, and Pine Ridge Service Unit; and, five IHS obstetrical hospitals are engaging in the re-designation process in 2019. One hospital, Blackfeet Community Hospital located in Browning, MT, has Re-Designation Pending. This activity meets IHS Objective 1.3 Access: Ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alask a Native people and the HHS Goal 2.2 Prevent, treat and control chronic conditions Collaborations have been established with Tribal health care systems with the goal of providing safe and quality care for Native communities. A collaborative agreement was formed between IHS and the Chickasaw Nation Medical Center, Ada, Oklahoma, to enhance clinical competencies for IHS Emergency Department, Perioperative Room, and Labor and Delivery CJ - 76Registered Nurses ( RNs). The agreement is designed to enhance IHS special ty nurses ' clinical competency through preceptored clinical rotations offered at the T ribally-managed Chickasaw Medical Center, which maintains higher patient volume. Factors that impact IHS' s capacity to assist RNs to maintain their level of clinical com petency, beyond initial licensure, credentialing, and continuing education, are attributable to geographically isolated IHS hospitals that are further challenged with fluctuating patient volume. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goals 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality Healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. The Division of Nursing Services (DNS) implemented the Rural Obstetrical Nurse Residency Program (RONR). The purpose of RONR is to facilitate a structured professional nursing experience for new and inexperienced obstetrical nurses in an effort to alleviate critical shortages of practicing nurses within the Indian Health System. To sustain the RONR, DNS led a workgroup to develop and draft a RONR charter. The workgroup consisted of Area Nurse Consultants through the agency. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goals 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality Healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. DNS made available 400 subscriptions to the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) web -based course. The web course was offered to Registered Nurses and Advanced Practice Nurses who care for patients in the emergency department, urgent care or other critical care settings, as well as nurses who provide additional coverage for these units . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goals 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality Healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. HIV Program In 2018, 37,968 people received an HIV diagnosis in the Unit ed States and dependent areas. O f those , approximately 3,600 were American Indian or Alaska Native. According to the CDC's HIV Surveillance Report using data reported through December 2019, the undiagnosed rate for AI/AN living with HIV is about 18 percent compared to the national average at 13 percent . An estimated one out of five AI/AN with HIV had been diagnosed. Although there is a slight variation from year- to-year, the new HIV diagnosis trend for AI/AN demonstrates stability from 2014-2018. The HIV diagnosis rate is approximately 8 per 100,000 for AI /AN compared to 5 per 100,000 for Whites. A high majority, 84 percent , of the reported HIV diagnoses in AI/AN people were among men. Most of the documented HIV transmission among these men was male -to-male sexual contact, accounting for 75 percent of new diagnoses. The second most common transmission route was from injection drugs combined with male- to- male sexual contact, accounting for 15 percent of new diagnoses. Among AI/AN women, the main transmission route was heterosexual contact, accounting for 57 percent of new diagnoses, followed by injection drug use at 43 percent of new diagnoses. Among AI/AN women, the main transmission route was heterosexual contact, accounting for 57 percent of new diagnoses, followed by injection drug use at 43 percent of new diagnoses. In this same CDC report, the death rate among AI/AN people living with HIV in 2018 was 30 percent lower than in 2014. 2 While IHS cannot infer direct causation on a national scale, the 2 CDC.

CJ - 77largest HIV treatment programs like those at the Phoenix and Gallup Indian Medical Centers show outstanding HIV testing, linkage to care, and viral suppression outcomes among their HIV patients. These sites use intensive and specialized case management to initiate care, adherence, and support for co-morbidi ties and social barriers that are unique to their patients' social and cultural contexts. In IHS, HIV screening increases are plateauing at 50 percent to 60 percent of those who have used IHS clinics in the past three years, especially in large IHS hospitals. Some of IHS' primary care facilities reach screening rates over 90 percent , but not all IHS patients access primary care and th erefore go unscreened for HIV. It is important to remember that while HIV screening programs in emergency departments, urgent care, and other non -primary care settings is crucial, these programs are difficult to start and sustain. (IHS Clinical Reporting System). IHS data shows that from 2005-2014, there were 2,273 HIV diagnoses in IHS facilities. 3 CDC data ranks AI/AN people fourth in the nation for the estimated rate of new HIV diagnoses when compared with all other races and ethnicities. Diagnosing HIV quickly and linking people to treatment immediately are crucial to achieving further reduction in new HIV infection s. Primary care providers are the front line for detecting and preventing the spread of HIV. People with HIV who are aware of their status should be prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART ) and, by achieving and maintaining an undetectable (<200 copies/mL ) viral load, can remain healthy for many years.4 ART is now recommended for all people with HIV, regardless of CD4 count.5 Studies show that the sooner people start treatment after diagnosis, the more they benefit from ART. Early diagnosis followed by prompt ART initiation6: Reduces HIV -associated morbidity and mortality; Greatly decreases HIV transmission to others; and May reduce risk of serious non- AIDSrelated diseases. A new analysis from CDC shows the vast majority - or about 80 percent - of new HIV infections in the U.S. in 2016 were transmitted from the nearly 40 percent of people with HIV who either did not know they had HIV, or who had been diagnosed but were not re ceiving HIV care. There is no reason to believe this statistic is different among American In dian and Alaska Native people. These data underscore the impact of undiagnosed and untreated HIV in the nation and also the critical need to expand HIV testing and treatment throughout Indian Country. While IHS has done excellent screening in primary care, annual increases in screening are experiencing diminishing returns, and we are looking at ways to better screen patients who do not 3 Reilley B, Haberling DL, Person M, Leston J, Iralu J, Haverkate R, Siddiqi AE.

According to the CDC, from 2010 to 2017, the annual number of HIV diagnoses increased 39 percent among AI/AN overall, but trends varied by age and gender. While HIV diagnoses for AI/AN women remained stable, CDC's most recent data shows a 54 percent increase for men. When looking at age grouping among AI/AN, CDC data shows a 67 percent increase in HIV diagnoses for thos e in the 25-34-year-old group. Most new diagnoses were among gay and bisexual men - a group that accounted for 77 percent of all AI/AN diagnoses. In the same report, the CDC also stated that when compared to other people overall with HIV, AI/AN people have lower viral suppression rates. For every 100 AI/AN with HIV, 60 received some HIV care, 46 were retained in care, a nd 49 were virally suppressed. 7 AI/AN living in the U.S. Southwest have more than 50 percent of all HIV diagnoses in the IHS system. Over 500 IH S patients are currently in HIV treatment in the Southwest, with over 85 percent viral suppression. IHS programs supported by the Minority HIV/AIDS Fund in the Southwest include PIMC, GIMC, Chinle, and Northern Navajo Medical Center (Shiprock). Data from the Southwest show that viral suppression rates are above 85 percent and moving the needle positively on statewide AI/AN HIV statistics in those states. The HIV Program goal is to prevent new HIV infections and ensure access to quality health services for AI/ANs living with HIV (IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce , 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care ser vices ; Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization & 2.2 Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs; Goal 2 Objective 2.1 Empower people to make informed choices for healthier living, 2.2 Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions , 2.4 Prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. Integrating the Depar tment' s Strategic Goal to protect the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play) . IHS increased overall prenatal HIV screening to 87 percent in FY 2016 - a 15 percent increase over FY 2006 data (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Empower people to make informed choices for healthier living ). To improve AI/AN access to health care in remote areas, the IHS HIV Program provides technical support to IHS, tribal, and urban Indian health sites on screening and treatment , and the use of telehealth (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high -quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service op tions, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs) In spring 2020, the IHS National HIV/HCV Program received $8.4 million from the HHS Minority HIV/AIDS Fund to expand partnerships between the IHS and Native communities for End the HIV epidemic in the U.S. National- level projects include the following: 1. National Technical Assistance and Outreach for HIV and HCV ($750,000); 7 https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/racialethnic/aian/index.html CJ - 792. Project Red 3. Enhancing Telehealth ($1,670,822); 4. Clinical Innovations ($1,771,770) a. Alaska Area Health Tech Case Management for HIV Care ($157,534); b. Chinle Health Tech Case Management for HIV Care ($55,382); c. Shiprock Health Tech Case Management for HIV Care ($55,382); d. GIMC: Health Tech Case Management for HIV Care, HIV Pharmacist, and HIV Case Manager ($442,848); and e. PIMC: HIV Pharmacist, HIV Case Manager, and Pharm 5. Empowering Healthier Tribal Communities ($2,925,000) a. IHS published and funded a $2.4 million limited competition notice of funding opportunity for the TECs to support tribal communities in reducing new HIV infections and relevant co- morb idities, specifically STD and HCV infections, improve HIV- , STI - and HCV-related health outcomes, and to reduce HIV- , STI - and HCV- related health disparities among AI/AN people. (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and r etain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce , 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 -2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high- quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs) . The TECs will provide resources to help Native communities address the four main pillars of the Ending the HIV Epidemic plan: Diagnose, Treat, Protect, and Respond ( HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 4, Objective 4.1 Improve surveillance, ep idemiology, and laboratory services ). Only current TEC grantees were eligible to apply for the competing supplemental funding under this announcement and had to demonstrate that they have complied with previous terms and conditions of the TEC program. Th ere were two separate, but related no tices in the Federal Register. The first was for those Tribal Epi Centers that do not provide services in the 48 counties or 7 southern states of t he EHE Phase One Jurisdictions. These \"Group A\" applicants could apply for up to $100,000. The second announcement - for \"Group B\" applicants - was for those TECs whose constituency contains one or more of the 48 counties or seven southern states in the Phase One jurisdictions of the EHE. These \"Group B\" applicants could ap ply for up to $275,000. b. The National Native HIV Network operated by the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Board for boots-on-the-ground coordinating and program direction to IHS ($100,000); c. IHS Office of Public Health Support, Division of Epidemiology and Disease Prevention (OPHS/DEDP) for STD work ($200K); and d. The Cherokee Self- and PrEP\" the IHS National HIV/HCV program submitted a propos al to OIDP for $1,500,000 as a congressionally mandated Tribal set -aside within the Minority HIV/ AIDS Prevention and Treatment program. The proposed project will allow AI/AN stakeholders to formulate their own response to HIV in their own communities by incorporating local leadership and knowledge w ith federal strategic plans and best practices. This proposed strategic planning project will address national- level strategy planning to End ing the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. by CJ - 80using an environmental scan and community- based assessment framework, working across all Indian Health Service Areas and including Urban Indian Organizations. In addition, the FY 2021 final appropriation includes \"$5,000,000 for the HIV and Hepatitis C initiative.\" The IHS is conducting tribal consulation and urban confer to understand priorities of Tribal and Urban Indian Organization leaders before making final decisions on funding allocations. In mid -January 2021, IHS released the HIV Primary Care Treatment Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents. The new guideline offers advice for the care of AI/AN persons with HIV and provides (1) guidance on HIV care specific to the AI/AN population, including tuberculosis prevention and diabetes screening; (2) recommendations for treatment utilizing drugs on the IHS Formulary; (3) specific advice on the care of transgender and gender non -binary persons in Indian Country; and (4) a single site resource that consolidates HIV, TB, STI, and primary care advice in one place for I/T/U care providers. The National HIV/HCV Program continues to c ollaborate with OIDP to ensure IHS pharmacies and patients have the best possible access to PrEP drugs under the Ready Set PrEP (RSP) program. OIDP and IHS have a draft RSP fact sheet for potential AI/AN PrEP users and a draft algorithm for IHS and tribal prescribers to help them navigate the RSP protocols. All of IHS' HIV projects and activities are supported by the Minority HIV/AIDS Fund, and that includes the $2.4 million in cooperative agreements to Tribal Epidemiology Centers. Following are some of their recent achievements: The Albuquerque Area Southwest Tribal Epidemiology Center developed an HIV/AIDS Resource Guide for the 27 tribal communities in New Mexico and southwestern Colorado. The guide contains data on HIV, Hepatitis C Virus, and othe r sexually transmitted infections in the geographic regions and highlights area resources in the communities that provide HIV testing and PrEP. The Alaska Native Epidemiology Center executed the Global Network of People Living with HIV Stigma Index survey in Alaska Native communities. The Urban Indian Health Institute's Trial Epi Center created a survey on HIV and PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs for staff at 41 urban Indian health organizations. The Oklahoma Area Tribal Epidemiology Center (OKTEC), in coordination with Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, launched a campaign to train providers and increase access to PrEP prescribers. The effort now counts more than 50 providers and represents 34 different tribes and tribal facilities. OKTEC and the Cherokee Nation are increasing HIV testing access through a text messaging system already in place and operational. This text messaging system will deliver HIV self -testing kits to doorsteps throughout Indian Country. OKTEC has a goal of a statewide reach by 2021; and a national reaching program by 2022. The Northwest Tribal Epi Center is using race- corrected HIV data from the Washington State Department of Health better to understand the HIV disease burden within NW tribal communities. Northwest Portland will use these data, along with virtual and in -person CJ - 81training on prevention, control, and outbreak investigation, to adopt HIV prevention and control methods on a local level that are de- stigmatizing and culturally appropriate. The IHS National HIV/HCV Program continually searches for ways to help the Area Offices and Service Units achieve their HIV and HCV goals. In the summer of 2020, the IHS National HIV/HCV Program created IHS Area- wide and Service Unit -specific report cards for nationally monitored HIV and HCV screening measures. In August, IHS, in partnership with the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, released the fourth and final course in the learning module called \"PrEP Navigator Training for Community and Public Health Staff.\" The learning module is available online. Go to www.ihs .gov and search \"PrEP Navigator.\" The Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board's Healthy Native Youth collaborative launched a Talking is Power campaign to help American Indian and Alaska Native parents and caring adults initiate difficult conversation s about sexual health topics with their teens and young adults. Caring adults can text the word \"EMPOWER\" to 97779 to receive weekly text messages that include culturally appropriate tips and resources, covering sexual health, pregnancy, HIV/STDs, condoms, and consent. Northwest Portland recently began it's second cohort of a six -month Trans & Gender- Affirming Care ECHO designed for IHS, tribal, and urban Indian health care providers. To assess the impact of COVID -19 on our HIV services, in May, August, and December IHS conducted a three-question survey of the clinical leads at our major anti- retroviral therapy programs - specifically those facilities receiving Minority HIV/AIDS Fund support. In total, we interviewed seven sites. The overall impressio n is that the impact of COVID has been moderate on the overall health of our patients with HIV as well as the impact on ART. However, many providers signaled that the quality of care is suffering and the effects will be manifest in time. A lack of in -person visits means some clinical indicators will go undetected. COVID is causing these HIV medical teams to work in silos more than ever before, and at least one site has reported new HIV patients since COVID -19. Still, one facility noted that resources going towards COVID-19 had actually improved ART adherence, as a proportion of their HIV patient cohort were homeless, but emergency housing was made available as part of the COVID- 19 response to stabilize their housing situation. Hepatitis C V irus (HCV) infections can result in illness varying in severity from mild (lasting a few weeks) , to serious (a lifelong illness ending in death by liver failure). The likelihood of liver damage is related to the duration and severity of untreated infection. The CDC estimates that 3.5 million persons in the U.S. have HCV; approximately 120,000 of whom identify as AI/AN.8 The IHS National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) data identifies 29,803 IHS patients from 2005-2015 with HCV, and estimates near ly 200 new cases each year; 53.4 percent were among persons born 1945-1965. The overall HCV burden was higher among males than females. This data does not include up to 50 percent of patients who remain undiagnosed. AI/AN people have the largest increase in liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer compared to any other race/ethnic groups. IHS data also identifies fewer than 1,000 HCV patients currently undergoing 8 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Edlin+Toward +amore+accurate+estimate CJ - 82treatment. HCV death rates among AI/ANs are more than twice the national average compared to other ethnic groups.9 The CDC and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that all persons born from 1945-1965 should be screened for HCV. The I HS has sustained a steady increase in HCV screening. The national recommendations since 2012 are to screen persons born 1945- 1965, or 'baby boomers.' More recently, the IHS screening recommendations were expanded to all persons 18 years and older - called 'universal screening' - in large part because of data emphasizing the importance and effectiveness of early diagnosis, treatment, and cure. IHS tracks both the baby boomers and universal screening measures nationally. For boomers, IHS screening coverage increased from 11 percent in 2012 to 66 percent in 2019. These improvements in screening go hand- in-hand wi th changes at I/T/U facilities. Many have added clinical 'reminders' to ensure that patients who have never been tested are offered an HCV test. Just as important, if a patient tests positive, I/T/U facilities can treat in -house, rather than referring out. Drugs for HCV treatment are free to IHS patients and treatment for most patients is simple enough (a course of 1-3 pills per day, for 8 to 12 weeks) that it can be done in primary care. This course of treatment has more than a 95 percent cure rate. IHS al igned program initiatives with the National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan (NVHAP) 2017- 2020, to eliminate new viral hepatitis infections, increase knowledge of hepatitis diagnoses, improve access to high quality health care and curati ve treatments, and eliminate stigma and discrimination (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce , 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high -quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs). IHS clinical data shows that screening for HCV among AI/ANs born from 1945-1965, increased from 8 percent in 2012, to 54 percent in 2017. This achievement is due in part to the integration of the Department's Strategic Goal One to reform, strengthen, and modernize the Nation's Healthcare System through the development of technical support tools like electronic health record (EHR) clinical reminders, publication of IHS policy guidelines for HIV and HCV, and creation of clinical linkages to care (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs ). IHS anticipates higher costs associated with HCV care in FY 2018 and FY 2019 associated with the increased rate of diagnosis (based on increased screening of Baby -Boomers and women of reproductive age) and the substantially high cost of curative medications. In FY 2019, IHS established universal screening for HCV for all patients over the age of 18 years at least once in their lifetime, followed by guideline- based treatment, as appropriate (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce , 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018- 2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high- quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and 9 https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2016surveillance/commentary.htm CJ - 83service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's dive rse needs ). Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) rates continue to rise in Indian Country, and recurrent STDs can increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Gonorrhea and syphilis often present as co - morbid conditions with HIV diagnosis, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). Data show that the incidence rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea among AI/AN people are approximately four times that of whites, and AI/AN have the second highest overall rates for both conditions when compared to all ot her races and ethnicities.10 Regional differences in STDs in Indian Country are also observed, and AI/AN youth and AI/AN women, particularly women of reproductive age, have a disparate and increased STD burden.11 Recent and sustained outbreaks of syphilis have also been observed among AI/AN communities, some related to injection drug and methamphetamine use, and both are recognized risk factors for HIV transmission. Domestic Violence Prevention (DVP ) - Domestic and intimate partner violence has a disproportionately large impact on AI/AN commun ities. According to a 2016 report by the National Institute of Justice ,12 more than four in five AI/AN women (84.3 percent) have experienced violence in their lifetime. In fact, Data from the National Institutes for Justice and the Center for Disease Control show that more than 1.5 million American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence, including sexual violence in their lifetimes13 with 66.4 percent of AI/AN reported having experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner. Intimate partner violence is preventable and many of the projects supported by the DVPP address this public health problem. Awarded DVP projects have prioritized prevention, providing services, increasing community awareness and identifying resources to address high rates of missing and murdered indigenous women (MMIW ) and girls. The DVP program was established in 2015, as a nationally coordinated program that provides culturally appropriate domestic violence and sexual assault prevention and intervention resources to AI/AN communities with a focus on providing trauma informed services. The DVP program supports IHS Goal 1 to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people and Goal 1, Ob jective 1.2 to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships. The DVP program funds a total of 83 projects that focus on domestic and sexual violence prevention, advocacy, and education about domestic violence and sexual violence, coordinated community responses, as well as provid ing forensic healthc are services to victims of domestic and sexual violence. On March 2, 2020, the IHS Director issued a decision on the funding mechanism to continue distribution of the DVP program funds through a new competitive funding cycle. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the DVP notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) will be released in the spring of 2021. This new funding opportunity will support Tribes in their continued efforts to offer domestic violence and sexual assault intervention and prevention services as they recover within their community . 10 https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/minorities.htm 11 the DVP program are as follows : 1. Build Tribal, Urban Indian Health Programs, and Federal capacity to provide coordinated community responses to AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence, 2. Increase access to domestic and sexual violence prevention, advocacy, crisis intervention, and behavioral health services for AI/AN victims and their families, 3. Promote trauma- informed services for AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence and their fam ilies, 4. Offer health care provider and community education on domestic violence and sexual violence, 5. Respond to the health care needs of AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence, and 6. Incorporate culturally appropriate practices and/or faith -based services for AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence. Data collected through the fifth year of the DVP program indicates an approximate 94,454 direct service encounters from projects focused on coordinated community responses, advocacy, forensic healthcare, integration of traditional healing, faith-based and culturally competent services. Review of most recent data indicate projects have experienced an e xpansion of services delivered to victims of domestic violence and intimate partner violence. More than 70% of service encounters are those offered to youth ages 17 and under and adults 25- 54 years of age. As the DVP emphasizes the important of community- based, culturally tailored projects, recent data shows that 18,640 individuals received cultural and faith -based services. Each year, select DVP grantees participate and present in the monthly DVP webinar series, which is a platform for collaborative learning , however due to the pandemic, ma ny of these webinars were cancelled. In FY 2020, IHS hosted a \"Safety Planning Basics\" webinar to enable programs across tribal communities to offer safety plans for domestic violence victims facing confinement due to the spread of COVID-19. IHS also rel eased an information sheet \"Sexual Assault Awareness Month and the Impact of COVID- 19\" as a resource document for Tribal communities. In addition, these funds support the Forensic Health Care (FHC) team within IHS HQ. The Forensic Health Care program established in 2009 has developed multiple policies within the Indian Health Manual to increase recognition of and prevention of sexual assault and child maltreatment (all forms including sexual abuse). The FHC team works wit h the DVP program to enhance intimate partner violence efforts , and strategy and resources to address human trafficking . The FHC team provides subject matter expertise and high -quality staff training, assistance to local facilities to create or sustain appropriate acute forensic care services, and strengthen on- going comprehensive services that enhance survivor healing. In FY 2020, IHS released a trauma informed care policy and has worked to implement the principles of trauma informed care to ensure its system understands the prevalence and impact of trauma, facilitates healing, avoids re -traumatization, and focuses on strength and resilience. Through the DVP program, more than 2,108 health professionals have received training in Trauma Informed Care. In addition, the FHC program has established a strong partnership with the International Association of Forensic Nurses. The services provided through this agreement include didactic and clinical forensic examination courses, quarterly educational webinars, and technical assistance to sexual assault programs operating within the I/T/U system. National Community Health Aide Program (CHAP): provides a network of health aides trained to support licensed health professionals while providing direct health care, health promotion, and disease prevention services. These providers work within a referral relationship under the supervision of license d clinical providers that includes clinics, service units, and hospitals. The program increases access to direct health services, including inpatient and outpatient visits CJ - 85through a focus on primary, emergency, behavioral, and dental health to equip Triba l communities with a network that expands the system of care and aids in the mobilization of healthcare in America's most rural and remote communities where access to care is few and far in between. In 2016, the IHS begun the efforts to expand the program nationally and in July 2020, the IHS announced the policy that formally established the national CHAP which sees to the use of health aides in the field of primary care, behavioral health, and oral health. There are currently X Tribes in the contiguous 48 ready to begin operating a CHAP. This number is increasing daily as more Tribes advocate at both the state and federal level for the services of CHAP to be a part of their local health care delivery system. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be ho spitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non- Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID -19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID- 19 Response. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount TRIBAL SHARES H&HC funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume responsibility for operating associated programs, functions, services, and activities, unless otherwise specified in the annual appropriations bill. A portion of the ove rall H&HC budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2022 budget submission for Hospitals and Health Clinics is $ 2.7 billion , which is $465 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level . FY 20 21 Base Funding of $2.2 billion - suppo rts the largest portion of clinica l care at IHS and Tribal health facilities, including salari es and benefits for hos pital/clini c administra tion; sala ries and benefits for physici ans, nur ses, a nd ancillary sta ff; pharm aceuticals; and m edical suppli es. These funds make up the lump sum r ecurring base distribution to t he Ar eas each fiscal y ear. CJ - 86Funding to support IHS facilities to promote efficient, effective, high quality care to the AI/AN population is also included in the base. FY 2022 Funding Increase of $465 million includes : Current Services : +$115 million for current services including: o Pay Costs +$ 66 million - to fund pay increases for federal and Tribal employees, of whom approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing health care and related services. o Inflation +$8 million - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. o Population Growth +$42 million - to fund the additional service need s arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. Staffing for New Facilities : +$92 million - These funds will support staffing and operating costs for new and replacement projects listed below. Funding for new/renovated healthcare facilities allows IHS to expand provision of health care in those areas where capacity has been expanded to address health care needs. The following table displays this request. New Facilities Amount FTE/Tribal Positions Yukon -Kuskokwim Primary Care Center (JV), Bethel, AK 1,000 Health Center (JV), Naytahwaush, MN NEACC (Salt River) Health Center, Scottsdale, AZ $33,234 ,000 265 Phoenix Indian Medical Center Central, Phoenix, AZ $2,254 ,000 30 Ysleta Del Sur Health Center (JV), El Paso, TX $4,455,000 38 Alternative Rural Health Omak Clinic Memorial Health Center (JV), New Town, ND $875,000 8 North Star Health C linics General Program Increase : +$190 million - to expand access to direct health care services. These resources will support efforts to reduce health disparities and improve the overall health status for American Indians and Alaska Natives by increasing the availability of health care services in Indian Country. The IHS estimates that these resources will support 39,000 inpatient admissions, and 12 million outpatient visits . Elimination of HIV, Hepatitis C, and Sexually Transmitted Diseases +$22 million , for a total of $27 million, to support efforts to diagnose all HIV -positive IHS patients as early as possible after infection, treat those living with HIV rapidly to achieve and sustain viral suppression, and protect individuals at high risk of HIV using pre -exposure prophylasis (PrEP). These resources will also help the IHS to effectively identify, treat, and prevent related conditions and risks for HIV infection, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and sexually transmitted disease (STD) infections, and respond rapidly to growing HIV clusters to prevent new HIV infections. CJ - 87Rates of STDs other than HIV also continue to rise in Indian country and can increase risk for HIV transmission. Additionally, IHS serves a population that is disproportionately affected by HCV \u2014the AI/AN population has more than twic e the rate of HCV incidence and nearly three times the rate of HCV -related mortality as the general U.S. population (CDC 2018). Without concerted intervention that includes expanded HIV, STD, and HCV prevention, testing, and treatment, along with increased clinical and public health resourcing and infrastructure, including associated pharmaceuticals and data generation and analysis capacity , rates of AI/AN HIV, STDs, and HCV will likely continue to increase in FY 2022 and beyond. Additional health statist ics about these priority diseases are provided in the program accomplishments section of this narrative. The additional $22 million requested above FY 2021 would: Expand patient screening and treatment for those living with HIV, STDs, and HCV, Provide targeted PrEP and expedited partner therapy to those at greater risk for acquiring HIV and other STDs, Effectively screen and treat those patients living with HIV and HCV, Sufficiently staff and resource oversight activities to ensure success, Bolster public health surveillance and data infrastructure , Evaluate these efforts, and Support outreach, education, and training. The proposed funding level directly supports IHS's efforts to provide high quality health care across the Indian health system, as well as IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships, & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high- quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and e xpand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs). IHS will concentrate efforts on building up its HIV and HCV infrastructure in the 12 Area Offices and Service Units. National Community Health Aide Program: +$20 million, for a total of $25 million, to expand the Community Health Aide Program (CHAP) to the lower 48 states, consistent with the Indian Health Care Improvement Act ( 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1616l (d) (l) -(3)), which authorizes the HHS Secretary acting through the IHS to establish a national CHAP outside of Alaska. The funding would support to training, certifying, and hiring health aides, in addition to managing the national program. The proposed spending would: Provide funding to IHS and Tribal Health Programs to establish their own CHAPs, after receiving required training and certification, Expand the training center network supported by Tribal Colleges and Universities and other Tribally -operated training programs. o The training center network consists of partnerships with Tribal Colleges and Universities as well as institutions specialized in culturally adapted health care curricula to serve as regional training centers for behavioral, community, and dental health aides, and to provide community education on using CHAP in CJ - 88Tribal communities. Support a new cohort of CHAP Tribal Assessment and Planning Grants and the CHAP Tribal Planning and Implementation Grants. These grants are designed to provide assistance for infrastructure planning to ensure sustainability and healthcare delivery system support of the CHAP workforce model. Create sustainable program infrastructure including maintenance, management, and operations of National and Area Certification Boards, setting national standards and procedures, as well as data and evaluation of workforce trends to respond effectively to health care needs in Tribal communities across the nation. The proposed funding level directly supports IHS's efforts to provide high quality health care across the Indian health system, as well asthe HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1: Objective 1.4 as this newly expanded program strengthens and expands the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs. HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2, 2.3., 2.4 as health aides play a critical role in the Indian health system to p revent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions. The behavioral health aide works to r educe the impact of mental and substance use disorders through prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery support. All health aides are required to train in emergency preparedness so they may prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. Finally, the system of health aides erects a paraprofessional workforce that ultimately supports HHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.1 to strengthen the economic and social well-being of Americans Across the Lifespan while eliminating barriers to promote economic opportunity through job creation. Assessments : $27 million for a total of $27 million, to offset the increasing costs of central assessments charged to the IHS since FY 2014. To address the growing costs of shared services at HHS, the IHS has delayed hiring and investments in critical systems, working to shield di rect health care services to the maximum extent possible. The FY 2022 estimate for IHS central assessment costs is $ 84 million. T he IHS is now at a point where it can no longer sacrifice oversight and management of national health programs to absorb these rising costs. By providing additional resources to address these costs, the IHS would be able to redirect its base funding to strengthen its quality system, ensure alignment with national standards for quality and patient safety, support recruitment and retention, and other critical administrative, support, and oversight activities of direct health care programs.

Cooperative Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service (IHS) Tribal Epidemiology Center (TEC) Program was first authorized by Congress in fiscal year (FY) 1992. The IHS program supporting TECs was first funded in FY 1996. The program was founded to develop public health infrastructure by augmenting existing Tribal organizations with expertise in epidemiology and public health via Epidemiology Centers. Funding is distributed to the TECs through cooperati ve agreements to Tribes and Tribal organizations such as Indian Health Boards. The TECs play a critical role in IHS' overall public health infrastructure. Operating within Tribal organizations, TECs are uniquely positioned to provide support to local Tribal disease surveillance and control programs, and assess the effectiveness of public health programs. All TECs monitor the health status of their constituent Tribes, produce a variety of reports annually or bi-annually that describe activities and progress towards public health goals, and provide support to Tribes who self -govern their health programs. The TEC program funds eleven TECs that provide compre hensive geographic coverage for all IHS administrative a reas and one additional TEC serving American Indian and A laska N ative (AI/AN) populations residing in major urban centers nationally. The IHS Division of Epidemiology and Disease Prevention (DEDP) functions as the national coordinating center and provides technical support and guidance to TECs. The DEDP and TECs collect, analyze, interpret, and disseminate health information in addition to identifying diseases to target for intervention, suggesting strategies, and testing the effectiveness of implemented health interventions. The TEC Program supports Tribal communities by providing technical training in public health practice and prevention -oriented research, and promoting public health caree r pathways for Tribal members. In FY 2020, a significant portion of TEC activities were devoted to supporting Tribes in confronting the COVID -19 public health emergency . Annually, 90 percent of the TEC Program budget is distributed through cooperative agreements based on a 5- year competitive award cycle. In the current 5- year award cycle beginning CJ - 94FY 2016, the average annual award across all 12 TECs w as $380,341. The next 5- year competitive aw ard cycle begin s in FY 2021. The TECs are fundamental to the IHS' partnership with Tribes by supporting epidemiology and public health functions essential to the delivery of healthcare services. Independent TEC goals are set as directed by their constituent Tribes and health boards. The DEDP tracks these goals and objectives as written in their cooperative agreements ( e.g., surveillance of disease and control programs ; collecting epidemiological data for use in determining health status of Tribal communities). The TEC funds provide critical support in strengthening the collaborative partnerships among the 12 TECs' constituent AI/AN communities as a part of the agency's work to address the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2 019-2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2 ( Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships) and the HHS Strategic Plan 2018-2022 Goal 4.1 ( Improve surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory services ). The work of the TECs to collect data relating to, and monitor progress made toward meeting, each of the health status objectives of the Service, the Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations in the service area is an essential part of meeting the IHS Goal 1, Objective 1.3, Strategy 7 ( Reduce health disparities in the AI/AN population ) by highlighting disparities in the AI/AN population so they can be reduced through Public Health efforts. This includes the significant health impact of the Opioid crisis in Indian Country and the disproportionate burden of HIV/AIDS, HCV , and sexually transmitted diseases in AI/AN communities. Significant improvements in reducing the burden of disparities in this population would strongly address the HHS Goal 2: Protect the Health of Americans Where They Live, Learn, Work, and Play . PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The TEC funds provide critical support in strengthening the collaborative partnerships among the 12 TECs and AI/AN communities (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2) . Below are key TEC activities. Data Projects that Engage Local Resources Data generated locally and analyzed by TECs enable Tribes to evaluate Tribal and community-specific health status for planning the needs of their Tribal membership. Immediate feedback is provided to the local data sy stems and leads to improvements in Indian health data overall. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (Section 130) includes language t hat designates the TECs as public health authorities in regards to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) o f 1996. This designation permits TECs to access IHS -generated data sets used to support various public health activities. TECs assist Tribes with projects such as conducting behavioral risk factor surveys to establish a base of measurement for successfully evaluating intervention and prevention activities related to behavioral health needs. Because national surveys (e.g., Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey, Youth Risk Behavior Survey) do not consistently capture representative data for AI/AN populations, TEC s have had an essential role in piloting adapted versions of these national surveys to include AI/AN populations. These surveys provide baseline and trend data used by Tribes and Urban Indian organizations (U IOs) to identify health -related needs and to prioritize interventions and prevention services. For example, one TEC combines these survey s and other CJ - 95data to generate reports on the health disparities of urban Indians and distributes nationally to all UIOs to identify health priorities, seek opportunities for new data collection, and support competitive, evidence-driven applications for funding opportunities to address these priorities. Improving Public Health Reporting for AI/AN Communities In public health administrative records, AI/AN people are often misidentified as another race, called racial misclassification. Racial misclassification occurs more often in AI/AN records than in records from other racial groups, which makes it hard to ac curately measure and describe the health status of AI/AN people. A specific effort by the Urban Indian Health Institute TEC recently drew attention to the omission or misclassification of American Indian and Alaska Native people in current standard data collection practices by many federal, state, and local entities in the report entitled, \"Best Practices for American Indian and Alaska Native Data Collection .\" To further TEC efforts to correct for racial misclassification to improve public health data quality, in 2019, IHS launched a pilot project with one TEC perm itting the use of IHS patient data to correct records within numerous existing public health data sets for AI/AN race. This work is currently underway and directly supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.3, Strategy 8 ( Assure system of data sharing to solidify partnerships with Tribal and urban Epidemiology Centers and other Tribal programs and Urban Indian Organizations ). This increase in information sharing with our TEC partners acknowledges and strengthens the statutory Public Health functions of the TEC program and builds on the expertise developed over the life of the program. Disease Surveillance and Evaluation In the expanding environment of Tribally- operated health programs, TECs provide additional public health services, such as disease control and prevention programs, in areas such as sexually transmitted disease control, HIV, and cancer prevention. Since 2019, nine TEC programs have been awarded funding to support the Elimination of HIV, Hepatitis C, and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Initiative . TEC efforts build capacity in the Indian health system by evaluating and monitor ing the effectiveness of health and public health programs. This allows TECs to assess access, use, and/or assess quality of care , and to develop recommendations for the targeting of services needed by the populations served. They manage public health information systems, investigate diseases of concern, manage disease prevention and control programs, communicate vital health information and resources, respond to public health emergencies, and coordinate these activities with other public health authorities. Collaboration The DEDP collaborates with the National Institutes of Health , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , and other federal agencies to supplement TEC activities , create stronger interagency partnership s, and prevent costly duplication of effort. TECs support national public health goals by working to improve data for the Government Performance and Results Act, agency performance reports, and monitoring of the Healthy People 2030 objectives at the Tribal level. Health status reports across all TECs will lead to a more comprehensive picture of Indian health. In the long term, these activities create opportunities for IHS to improve the delivery of services by calling attention to health disparities or concerns experienced by the population the Agency serves. CJ - 96COVID-19 Response As part of the Public Health Response to the COVID- 19 emergency, TECs coordinated across their centers to hold weekly calls sharing best practices and workshopping concerns, linked their websites for one C OVID -19 response page, and shared new tools and materials as they were developed to improve the speed of the collective response. Using existing dollars, TECs conduct a range of response activities, incl uding: 1) Direct responses to tribal technical assistance requests. 2) Publishing case report and contact tracing tools. 3) Publishing community- specific fact sheets. 4) Identifying gaps in existing fact sheets and communications. These include coding data and how to talk to young children about C OVID . 5) Developing fact sheets and communication materia ls to address Tribal needs for community education. 6) Reporting to local command teams. 7) Coordinating a Tribal public health listserve. 8) Developing and releasing situational awareness reports. 9) Partnering with State and County Public Health Departments. 10) Partnering with local IHS facilities and Area offices. 11) 24 hour hotline staffed for technical assistance requests. 12) Increasing comprehensive community planning. 13) Produced educational materials for their tribes on managing governments while teleworking. 14) Launched Weekly C OVID -19 teleecho clinic call for providers. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount * 2018 $4,433,361 2019 $4,433,361 budget. REQUEST The FY 2022 budget submission for the TECs under Hospitals and Health Clinics (H&HC) is $11 million and is $360,000 above the FY 2021 Enacted level. The FY 2022 funding increase includes: Current services +$360,000 as follows: o Pay Costs +$280,000 - to fund pay increases for federal and Tribal employees, of who approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing health care and related services. o Inflation +$80,000 - to fund inflationary costs of providing services. CJ - 97The funding per TEC covers the salaries of a Director, one full -time Epidemiologist, administrative assistance /support, comprehensive local Public Health planning efforts, specia l projects specific to disease states or local outbreaks, and the execution of additional pressing disparity projects or tribal priorities. OUTPUTS / OUTCOMES DISCUSSION The TECs provide critical support to the communities they serve. In FY 2020, TECs responded to 5,928 requests for technical support (EPI -4) and completed 137 TEC -sponsored trainings for tribal public health capacity building (EPI -5). The increase in technical assistance efforts may reflect the additional resources made available during the COVID -19 response. Additionally, while the overall funding amount allocated to the TECs increased by $5 million starting in Tribal Epidemiology Centers and Location s 1 Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium Anchorage, AK 2 Albuquerque A rea Indian Health Board Albuquerque, NM 3 Great Lakes Inter -Tribal Council Lac du Flambeau, WI 4 Inter -Tribal Council of Arizona Phoenix, AZ 5 Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council Billings, MT 6 Navajo Nation Division of Health Window Rock, AZ 7 Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Health Board Northern Plains - Great Plains Area Rapid City, SD 8 Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board Portland, OR 9 Southern Plains Tribal Health Board Foundation Oklahoma City, OK 10 Seattle Indian Health Board Seattle, WA 11 United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc.

These essential activities promote compliance with federal laws and regulations to improve efficiency and effectiveness of all IHS HIT portfolio investments. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Office of Information Technology (OIT) successfully provided a secure and effective suite of technology solutions to support the agency and its mission throughout the country. CJ - 102Collaboration with tribal health programs and other federal agencies is key to the success of the HIT P ortfolio. IHS works closely with the ONC, CMS, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, VA, and other federal entities on IT initiatives to ensure the direction of its HIT systems are consistent with other federal agencies. In addition, IHS has routinely sha red HIT artifacts (e.g., design and requirement documents, clinical quality logic, etc.) with both public and private organizations. The Health Information Technology Systems and Support (HITSS) program completed development for the 2015 Certified Electronic Health Record criteria. Deployment of the certified software is nearly complete and will be completed by the end of FY2021. The HITSS program supported rapid development and deployment of software updates in response to the COVID -19 pandemic to support new diagnoses code sets, laboratory testing and resulting, and vaccine administration and reporting to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The program's work to support COVID includes major development to provide mechanisms for centralized reporting through the AIMS portal for COVID lab testing, as well as the development of a centralized COVID vaccine reporting system, which also feeds a national dashboard available to IHS stakeholders. As part of the Agency effort for stabilization and modernization , the HITSS program continues work on the 4 Directions Hub pilot project focused on health information exchange within government as well as the eHealth Exchange. Pilot sites have started to onboard and testing is underway with the Veteran's Administration. The HITSS program certified our software to the FY2021 eCQM certification requirements, as well as completed the bi- annual re - certification of EPCS in February that directly supports our provider's ability to electronically prescribe controlled substance s. The HITSS program completed a major software infrastructure database upgrade, which facilitates the ability for sites to participate in planned health information exchange and interoperability requirements that will be delivered with the 21 Century Cure s Act initiative. HITSS also successfully implemented a replacement for the Immunization Forecasting software used across our facilities. In addition to the high velocity response to COVID, our HITSS program staff delivered 14 full version updates and 96 r equired maintenance updates across the health IT portfolio for FY2020 and 4 full version updates and 19 required maintenance updates as of January FY2021. In response to the social distancing guidance, IHS adjusted the delivery of training to focus on virtual offerings. The program provided 309 HIT training courses to 9,331 I/T/U users in FY2020. As of January 2021 for FY2021, the program provided 104 HIT training courses to 9,075 I/T/U users - the number of participants greatly increased as additional C OVID focused trainings were provided. Over 458,500 messages were exchanged between patients, providers, administrators, message agents and received from external HISPs through approximately 40,250 unique direct e-mail addresses since Sept 2015. The IHS P ersonal Health Record (PHR) has approximately 35,650 total users, and 57 percent of these registered PHR users were verified/linked to their IHS Medical Record. The remaining 43 percent are registered but not yet verified/linked. The National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) investment leveraged its agile rapid application development and deployment lifecycle model to support the development of the IHS Disease Surveillance solutions in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. In Q2 of FY2020, NPIRS assessed various software solutions and made recommendations to senior leadership on the path forward to automate the IHS COVID-19 data collection and reporting effort. NPIRS led the design, development and implementation of the C OVID -19 data collection and national surveillance reporting solution which completely automated the initial manual process of managing Abbott inventory, data collection and COVID-19 test administration and reporting across the IHS user population. NPIRS a lso collaborated with OEHE on the COVID Data Collection Portal design and provided support with the onboarding of I/T/U sites to both testing solutions. The COVID -19 Testing solution supported over 300 federal, tribal and urban users and CJ - 103provided immediat e insight into testing results at the site, area and national levels. NPIRS also created customized BI reports that are auto -generated and distributed to tribal and urban partners unable to access the national dashboard. The COVID-19 testing solution aut omated the process by 95% and alleviated massive amounts of manual data collection and reporting. NPIRS also collaborated with HHS and developed a custom data feed to support HHS Protect reporting. As part of the COVID- 19 vaccination initiative, NPIRS wo rked closely with the HITSS Investment and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to define the strategy for immunization collection and reporting. NPIRS developed several business intelligence/business analytic solutions to support vaccine administration (patient and employee), vaccine manufacturer, dosage, demographic and population information. In addition, a file management and tracking dashboard was developed that provides near real-time information on the submission of standard HL7 v2.5 messages containing patient vaccination information sent to IHS and CDC. All of the NPIRS BI/BA products enable federal, tribal and urban programs to track individual and national views (area, state, headquarters) of COVID data and enables users to validate data and identify gaps data in reporting to CDC. As part of this effort, daily office hour sessions and virtual training in the use of these products was provided to users. NPIRS developed an Opioid Surveillance dashboard for the National Committee on Heroin Opioid s and Pain Efforts (HOPE) to promote appropriate and effective pain management, reduce overdose deaths from heroin and prescription opioid misuse, and improve access to culturally appropriate treatment. In support of this effort, a BDW -C Scorecard was cre ated which provides information on data provisioning from the sites to support Opioid Surveillance. Iteration 2 of this effort continues into FY2021. NPIRS continues to maintain and support the Enterprise BI/Analytic solutions within the Qlik Enterprise Environment to include user access support, data refresh activities and enhancements for the agency. Enterprise BI solution support is provided to headquarters program offices, tribal, urban, area, service unit, and facility stakeholders. This support enables reporting, data discovery, data mining, predictive analysis and trending of key performance indicators supporting patient care and patient care management by providing strategic actionable information to key stakeholders. NPIRS continues to facilitate and improve reporting capabilities for programs, such as the Office of Urban Indian Health Program (OUIHP) Uniform Data Set (UDS) reporting requirements, the Office of Clinical and Preventive Services (OCPS) GPRA/GPRAMA national reporting, Maternal Child Health, Partnership to Advance Tribal Health, Behavioral Health, Pharmacy reporting, and Quality initiatives. Quality initiatives include, but are not limited to the Inpatient/Outpatient Quality Reports, National Accountability for Quality, Wait Time and Improved Patient Care. In addition, extensive support has been provided to the Office of Finance and Accounting (OFA) national reporting efforts for budget execution and monitoring solutions. These efforts are continuing in FY 2021. IT Operations complete d over 400 projects and acquired over 100 products and services. Notable projects and accomplishments are as follows: Expanded the ServiceNow platform to standardize processes, capabilities, and service alignment across IHS. This project implemented a ServiceNow Knowledge Base and created over 250 articles to allow more efficient self -help options for IHS staff. Expanded the Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to meet the increased telework demands caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Completed the em ail migrations to the new Microsoft Exchange Online cloud service. The email upgrade project was a multi- year effort. Sustained above 99.9% network availability across all WAN and Internet connections used by HQ and Area Offices. Upgraded network circuits to increase bandwidth to approximately 25 IHS facilities. CJ - 104 Enabled Network Access Control (NAC) at Headquarters facilities and data centers to prevent unauthorized network access. Deployed an Enterprise Wireless Authentication Service to provide mo dern authentication controls on wireless networks to prevent unauthorized access. Streamlined datacenter operations by re- designed the Rockville Data Center (RDC) to use the same technologies as the Albuquerque Data Center (ADC), provide new critical application redundancy capabilities, and optimize data center leadership by consolidating two data center manager positions into one. IT Security and Compliance has three new cybersecurity policies pending approval: Security Assessment and Authorization; Audit and Accountability; and Identification and Authentication. Implementation of these new policies will help ensure cybersecurity activities are defined and executed consistently across the IHS enterprise to protect both information and information systems. In response to cybercriminal efforts to launch coronavirus- related scams, the IHS Cybersecurity Program developed a COVID Vaccine Cybersecurity Awareness Website that provides education about coronavirus scams, phishing attacks, and telework dangers employees might encounter. The website is located at: https://www.ihs.gov/oit/security/covid -vaccine- cybersecurity -awareness . The IHS Cybersecurity Program won the award for Best Security Awareness Website in the 2020 Security Awareness and Training Contest at the annual Federal Information Systems Security Educators' Association (FISSEA) conference hosted by the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST). The winning website provided information regarding the hazards of seemingly harmless but sensational web content. The IHS Cybersecurity Program implemented a new GEO -IP blocking solution that reduces the attack landscape for various command and control malware variants, malicious websites, and denial -of- service attacks targeting IHS. The new solution disrupts traffic bound for IHS from non -NATO countries or sent to non-NATO countries from IHS resulting in a significant reduction in denial-of-service attacks. D ata from over 380 network devices was successfully imported into Splunk to search, monitor and analyze IHS network traffic. The IHS Cybersecurity Program successfully implemented nine Office of Inspector General recommendations from previous audits and closed out twenty Plan of Action and Milestone weaknesses from system security assessments and waivers; managed creation of more than 100 IHS facility backup/recovery plans for patient- care IT systems; and processed 317 new firewall rule requests and 751 ann ual firewall renewals. IT Management has improved IT governance through enhanced utilization of the Planview Portfolio Management System that provid es an enterprise IT portfolio and project management capability enabl ing IHS to improve project performance oversight and monitor corrective actions through to completion. The Planview system also provides a comprehensive Enterprise Architecture capability enabling line of sight linkage between IHS strategic goals & objectives, business capabilities, and the IT requirements needed to support those capabilities. These continued enhancements provide management tools to help ensure IHS prioritizes IT spend on investments that directly support strategic goals. OIT staff provided virtual present ations on HIT initiatives at various tribal or tribal health board conferences and meetings such as TribalNet , National Tribal Health Conference, Tribal Technical Advisory Group, National Indian Health Board (NIHB), NIHB Medicare, Medicaid, and Health Reform Policy Committee, IHS Tribal Self Governance Advisory Committee, and the Direct Service Tribes Advisory Committee quarterly meetings, etc. OIT staff regularly participated virtually in Tribal Delegation Meetings and the Alaska Area Pre- negotiation/Negotiation meetings to address IT/HIT issues. The OIT Healthcare Connect Fund Program provided support to 111 federal and 70 t ribal locations. The IHS Enterprise Mobile Services Program was established and accomplished the requirements of M-16-20 by establishing enterprise contracts with AT&T FirstNet and Verizon, and has transitioned over 80 percent of all IHS mobile devices to these contracts achieving both cost CJ - 105savings and cost avoidance by eliminating unnecessary MiFi devices and duplicative acquisition actions. Immediate Priorities and Challenges The IHS HIT P ortfolio continues to face increased demand for systems improvements and enhanc ements, rising costs, and increased IT security requirements driven in part by medical advances, and ever-growing and more complex requirements for health information technology capabilities. These requirements come from government and industry initiatives, needs of health programs, and operational requests of I/T/U health care facilities. Each new program initiative has information technology requirements for functionality, modality, data collection, and reporting which then must be added to a clinician's work flow and managed within the HIT portfolio. The largest priority and challenge involves the IHS RPMS system and its dependency on the VA for software development. RPMS is impacted by the VA's announcement to adopt the Military Health System \"Genesis\" solution to replace its current legacy Health IT platform, VistA. This move will impact IHS as the RPMS system is dependent on the VA's VistA system through shared software development. The IHS adopts software developed by the VA and adapts it for use in RPMS. Thus, the VA's decision means that a significant supplier of software source code that modernizes and supports RPMS will decline over time. The IHS previously adopted the VA software with minimal funding expenditure in support of a similar but different agency mission. The loss of the VA as a source of software code will raise the cost of continuing to use the RPMS system, and/or require IHS to procure commercial-off-the- shelf replacements for RPMS. CyberSecurity challenges include minimizing unsecured systems and data to reduce the possibility of data loss, identity theft, risk to patient health data, system breaches , and loss of business continuity in the event of a disaster. System breach or intrusion into an unsecure network puts patient data at risk, impacts the IHS mission by delaying or halting patient care, and harms IHS patients lead ing to a lack of trust in patient services. Human resource shortages and slow staff backfill contributes to challenges in keeping up with evolving technology and new Federal, Department and Agency projects/initiatives including FITARA Implementation. OIT has a persistent vacancy rate of 40 percent . FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount1 2018 represents the total cost of HIT within IHS federal programs. The majority is from Hospitals & Health Clinics budget line with a small amount from Direct Operations for federal personnel and travel. CJ - 106TRIBAL SHARES H&HC (IT is funded out of H&HC) funds are subject to tribal shares , currently at approzimately 25 percent , and are transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for carrying out the associated programs, functions, services, and activities. A portion of the overall H&HC budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retain ed by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 20 22 budget submission for Health Information Technology of $182.1 million is the same as the FY 202 1 Enacted level . This funding will continue progress made in past years by minimizing infrastructure costs and maintaining a high level of productivity and commitment by both federal and contractor staff supporting the IHS-developed health information solutions. IHS uses open source tools where possible to minimize acquisition costs and is reducing use of more costly assisted acquisition providers such as the General Services Adm inistration. However, following the announcement by the VA, the IHS is considering the sustainability of the entire RPMS HIT platfo rm. Efforts are underway to examine alternatives to replace or modify RPMS as the IHS HIT platform. The HHS - IHS HIT Modernization Research Project was completed in FY 2020 to examine alternatives to replace or modify RPMS as the IHS HIT platform. The IHS Modernization Project will change the current EHR platform and positively impact the quality of direct patient care, increase cost recovery and promote continuous health improvements such as, expanded telehealth care services and predictive population health analytics. These potential returns highlight the value of health IT and its impact on the agency mission.

Permanent Allocation Method .............. Direct Federal; PL 93 -638 Tribal Contracts/Compacts , Tribal shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Electronic Health Record System Modernization - The IHS has a significant opportunity to dramatically improve health care in Indian Cou ntry, and the health care status of American Indians and Alaska Natives, by modernizing the IHS Electronic Health Record, called the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS). RPMS is over 50 years old, and the GAP identifies it as one of the 10 most critical federal agency legacy systems in need of modernization. The system operates on the Veteran Health Administration's ViSTA system, which is soon to be replaced by the modernized Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense EHR. The system's aging code cannot be supported over the next decade, nor can it be sustained with the current hardware and network. RPMS is a comprehensive health information technology (HIT) system that supports a broad range of clinical, population health, and business processes from patient registration through the billing cycle. The IHS relies on its EHR for all aspects of patient care, including the patient record, prescriptions, care referrals, and billing public and private insurance for reimbursable health care services (ov er $1 billion annually). The IHS developed RPMS internally, leveraging a decades-long collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and is certified to the 2015 Edition criteria published by the Office of the National Coordinator for Healt h Information Technology (ONC). In recent years, advances in health - related standards and technologies, an increasingly complex regulatory environment around HIT, and the decision of the VA to move to a commercial off-the- shelf HIT solution, have combined to make the current approach to IHS HIT development and support non - sustainable going forward. In 2018-19, IHS, in collaboration with HHS, engaged in comprehensive research and analysis of the current state of its HIT infrastructure and options for modernization. Informed by the outcomes of that project, IHS has published its intent to move forward with modernization by CJ - 108 transitioning from its legacy RPMS to state of the art, commercial off -the-shelf systems. The approach to modernization is not limited to an Electronic Health Record (EHR), but must support a true enterprise approach to HIT, enabling the highest quality inpatient, ambulatory, behavioral health, dental, pharmacy, laboratory, imaging, referral, and revenue cycle services, with standards-bas ed interoperability and analytics capabilities, positioning IHS in the best possible way to accomplish its mission in the coming years. In early FY 2021 the IHS partnered with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Alliance to Modernize Healthcare Federally Funded Research and Development Center (Health FFRDC) to formally launch the IHS health IT modernization initiative. The Health FFRDC, managed by the MITRE Corporation, is responsible for standing up the Program Management Office, supporting the governance structure for the initiative, assisting with acquisition planning, market research, stakeholder engagement, communication, and numerous other aspects of the initiative. IHS expects to issue Requests for Information (RFI) from industry and one or more subsequent Requests for Proposals (RFP) before the end of FY 2021, with an intent to award initial HIT modernization contracts in early FY 2022. In the meanti me IHS will add permanent staff to manage the various aspects of HIT modernization that are inherently federal and will need to be sustained for the foreseeable future. IT Infrastructure and Operations Modernization - Significant improvements are required in order for the information technology ( IT) infrastructure at IHS to fully support the deployment of a new, modern HIT solution. IHS must enhance cybersecurity, improve IT service management, expand storage and computing capacity, and increase network bandwidth at dozens of rural locations to enable a successful EHR transformation. IT operations throughout IHS will need to be managed and coordinated more effectively to successfully execute a complex modernization project. Part of the work tasked to the Health FFRDC referenced above is a comprehensive analysis of infrastructure gaps, conducted in collaboration with the IHS technology operations staff. This analysis will facilitate planning and prioritization of infrastructure upgrades in preparation for EHR modernization. Current active projects in support of the modernization goal include establishing a national hub for connection to the eHealth Exchange in order to support health information exchange (HIE) with the VA, Department of Defense, and other external partners, as well as leveraging the experience of COVID -19 to improve the agency's capabilities for enterprise reporting of immunizations, laboratory results, and public health notifications to state and federal entities. The IHS Modernization of Health IT System & Support (mHITSS) investment is the primary mechanism IHS will utilize to modernize HIT in support of IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.3, \"Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions\" . This investment also supports HHS Goal 5, Objective 5.3, \"Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals\" . FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2018 $0 109 REQUEST FY 2022 budget submission for E lectronic H ealth Record Modernization is $285 million . This is an increase of $250 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level . This funding will lay the groundwork to improve the quality of care, reduce the cost of care, promote interoperability, simplify IT service management, increase the security of patient data, enhance cybersecurity, and update infrastructure across rural locations to enable a successful Electronic Health Record transition. This will include the continuation of project management operations, acquisition planning, EHR selection, additional tribal consultation, initial infrastructure build, site implementation p lanning, and continued RPMS stabilization and support. The project will follow industry standards for modernization or replacement of Electronic Health Record systems to leverage expertise and experience in the private sector. This effort directly support s IHS's entire Strategic Goals structure. Health Information Technology Modernization - The IHS Health Information Technology Modernization effort will use the additional FY 2022 resources to execute several core activities in FY 2022. Specifically, the IHS expects to address the following: o RPMS Stabilization: IHS will complete updates to the legacy systems to achieve compliance with the 21st Century Cures updates for 2015 Edition ONC certification. Significant development, testing, patching, rollout an d training efforts will be required, using expanded contract resources. o Interoperability: The IHS will complete its interoperability pilot in FY 2021, and then begin a national rollout to enable exchange both within the IHS enterprise and with external referral network partners. This effort will require sub stantial testing with partners as sites are on -boarded in order to ensure seamless and accurate interoperability. o Immunization Infor mation Systems: The IHS is planning additional initiatives to move certain capabilities from the local to the enterprise level, including centralized systems to accomplish exchange with state immunization information systems and reporting to public health agencies. o Initial Build of EHR Environment: With a vendor selection for the new EHR system in early FY 2022, work will begin on the design and build steps, to prepare the commercial system for operation in the IHS environment. This activity typically takes twelve months with significant resources required to convene and gather input from subject matter experts across a range of disciplines and move decisions that could number in the thousands through governance processes to meet the agency's configuration requirements. o Local Needs: Once the IHS selects an EHR product, the Agency can define the the technology architecture required for optimal performance of and support for the system. The IHS can then target identified gaps at local facilities and in the wide area network and hosting systems.. This effort will include both capital (equipment) and resource (contract) costs. o Initial Site(s) Transition Planning : Resources will support the development of a core planning template and master deployment schedule. This will also accommodate individual site planning using the template to address technology infrastructure remediation, site configuration, end user training, change management, communication, and stakeholder engagement at the local level near the deploym ent target for each site. Many of these activities need to be completed in a short amount of time immediately prior to a site's go -live. CJ - 110 The IHS anticipates going live at the first site late in FY 2022. o This project holds an extremely high degree of missi on criticality given the ability to provide much- anticipated clinical and administrative capabilities used in modern systems for the delivery of timely and impactful healthcare. Expected benefits from adopting and implementing a modernized system include, but are not limited to : improved patient safety, improved patient outcomes, better disease management, enhanced population health, improved clinical quality measures, opioid tracking, patient data exchange, third party revenue generation, agency performance reporting, and more . Additionally, the IHS intends to achieve the best possible interoperability with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Tribal and U rban Indian health programs, academic affiliates, and community partners, many of whom use different HIT platforms. The IHS must acquire a state-of-the- art EHR system that supports a true enterprise approach to HIT, enabling the highest quality inpatient, ambulatory, behavioral health and other ancillary healthcare and business office services, with standards- based interoperability and analytics capabilities, positioning IHS in the best possible way to accomplish its mission in the coming years. During the estimated 10 -year implementation, IHS expects to temporarily increase the HIT workforce to acquire and implement this system. IHS Legacy EHR System Modernization - The current IHS EHR, Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), has been identified by the Government Accoun tability Office as one of HHS' s top three systems in most need of modernization due to lack of development and enhanc ement work over the past decade. IHS must maintain the existing EHR system until implementation of the new system is complete. IT Infrastructure and Operations Modernization - These IT Infrastructure Modernization initiatives are required to provide the platform for which the EHR operates and support redundancy capacity . IHS Strategic Goal 1 , Objective 1 .2, \"Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships.\" IHS will b uild a mature governance body to ensure the enterprise HIT investment is properly maintained and configured nationwide. IHS Strategic Goal 2 , Objective 2.1 \"Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization\" , and Objective 2.2, \"Prov ide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities.\" The Dentrix software will be upgraded nationwide to coordinate care in a national enterprise HIT environment. Addit ionally, f unding will al low for improved r ecruitment and retention of providers and r educed industry risk by adopting standards and systems used by a broader base of healthcare systems IHS Strategic Goal 3, Objective 3.3, \"Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions.\" Funding will all ow for i mproved revenue from third party payers , improved training through standardized user interfaces and integration across health facilities, r educed workload to support the infrastructure, and i mproved quality and operational oversight through improved national reporting and data analytics.

Direct Federal , P.L. 93 -638 Self- Determination Contracts, Tribal shares, Grants, and Self -Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The purpose of the Indian Health Service (IHS) Dental Health Program (DHP) is to raise the oral health status of the American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) population to the highest possible level through the provision of quality preventive and treatment services, at both community and clinic sites. The DHP is a service-oriented program providing basic dental services (e.g., diagnostic, emergency, preventive, and basic restorative care) , which represents approximately 90 percent of the dental services provi ded. In FY 2020, the dental program provided a total of 2,595,059 basic dental services, a 36 percent decrease from FY 2019. This decrease, the largest ever measured in the IHS system, was due entirely to routine dental care shutting down in mid- March 2020 and most dental facilities not resuming routine dental services for the remainder of FY 2020. More complex rehabilitative care (e.g., root canals, crowns and bridges, dentures, and surgical extractions) is provided where resources allow and accounted fo r the additional 180,319 dental services in FY 2020, a 34 percent drop from FY 2019. The DHP provided these services through 915,426 dental visits in FY 2020, a substantial drop of 37 percent from FY 2019, the largest such decrease ever recorded and direc tly attributed to the aforementioned effects of COVID -19 on IHS dental programs throughout the country. Across all age groups, AI/ANs suffer disproportionately from dental disease. When compared to other racial or ethnic groups, AI/AN children 2- 5 years old have more than double the number of decayed teeth and overall dental caries experience as the next highest ethnic group, U.S. Hispanics, and more than four times that of U.S. white children. 1 In the 6- 9 year -old age group, 8 out of 10 AI/AN children have a history of dental caries compared with only 45 percent of the general U.S. population, and almost half of AI/AN children have untreated tooth decay compared 1 Phipps KR, Ricks TL, Mork NP, and Lozon TL.

CJ - 113to just 17 percent of the general U.S. population in this age group.2 In the 13-15 year-ol d age group, three out of four AI/AN dental clinic patients have a history of tooth decay, compared to half of 13-15 year-olds in the general U.S. population, and almost three times as many 13 -15 year-old AI/AN youth have untreated decay compared to the general U.S. population.3 In adults, the disparity in disease is equally as pronounced. 64 percent of AI/AN adults 35 -49 years have untreated decay compared to just 27 percent of the general U.S. population, and across all other age groups studied (50-64 y ears, 65 -74 years, and 75 and older), AI/AN adults have more than double the prevalence of untreated tooth decay as the general U.S. population. In addition, the rate of severe periodontal disease in AI/AN adults is almost double that of the general U.S. population.4 Prevention activities improve health and reduce the amount and cost of subsequent dental care. The DHP measures performance in part through the delivery of preventive services. The DHP maintains data and tracks three key program objectives: 1. Increase the proportion of 2- 15 year -olds with dental sealants; 2. Increase the proportion of 1- 15 year -olds receiving at least one application of topical fluorides; and 3. Increase access to care across all age groups. The DHP funds provide critical support for direct health care services focused upon strengthening the collaborative partnerships among direct care providers, patients, communities, and internal and external stakeholders. Funds are utilized to ensure IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health organizations have comprehensive, culturally appropriate services and personnel available and accessible, promotes excellence and quality through implemented quality improvement strategies, and strengthens the IHS program management and operations to address health disparities and raise the health status of AI/AN populations to the highest level possible. The DHP provides critical services in support of the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 (IHS SP) and the HHS Strategic Plan FY 201 8-2022 (HHS SP). Dental services are important in ensuring comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available to AI/AN people (IHS SP Goal 1). DHP implements several efforts to improve quality (IHS SP Goal 2) of denta l health services and in strengthening management and operations (IHS SP Goal 3). C entral to DHP efforts is support of cross-collaboration and partnerships among I/T/U stakeholders (IHS SP Objective 1.2). The DHP provides essential services to increase dental health access and education which supports the HHS SP Goal 1: Reform, strengthen, and modernize the nation's healthcare system, and Goal 5: Promote effective and efficient management and stewardship. The program accomplishments section below provides details about DHP efforts. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Early Childhood Caries Collaborative 2 Phipps KR and Ricks T L.

Indian Health Service data brief. Rockville, MD: Indian Health Service 2016. CJ - 114The IHS Early Childhood Caries (ECC) Collaborative was a nationwide initiative that was conducted from 2009 to 2017 and focused on preventing tooth decay in AI/AN children under the age of 71 months. Dental caries are the most common health problem in children, almost eight times more common than childhood asthma, and have significant consequences such as delayed speech development, more missed school days when children begin school, poor self- esteem, and a greater chance of tooth decay in permanent teeth. 5 As previously described , AI/AN children suffer disproport ionately from this disease, with more than double the number of decayed teeth as the next highest minority population, U.S. Hispanics, and more than 3 times the number of decayed teeth as U.S. White children.6 The ECC Collaborative began with the goal of reducing dental caries in the AI/AN population through a coordinated, nationwide collaborative utilizing not only dental programs but also medical and community partners such as medical providers, public health nurses, community health representatives, pharmacists, and Head Start teachers. (Suppo rts IHS SP 1.2 and HHS S P Objective1.2: Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition.) By the end of this collaborative, the IHS had increased access to dental care for AI/A N children under 71 months by 7.9 percent and significantly increased prevention and early intervention efforts (sealants increased by 65.0 percent, the number of children receiving fluoride varnish increased by 68.2 percent, and the number of thera peutic fillings increased b y 161 percent) . (Supports IHS S P Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services; and HHS SP Objective 1.3: Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options. ) This resulted in a 5 percent reduction in caries (tooth decay) experience from 2010 to 2019, and a 14 percent reduction in untreated decay in 1- 5 year -olds (with statistical significance) at a national level; in addition, the Navajo, Oklahoma City, and Phoenix Areas had statistically significant reductions in caries experience from 2010 to 2019. ( Supports the IHS SP Goal 2: To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization, IHS Objective 2.2: Provide care to bett er meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities ; and HHS SP Objective1.2 .) This represents the first recorded decrease in tooth decay in young children in the IHS and is evidence of success of the Early Childhood Caries Collaborative. Furthermore, this success has impacted older children: the 2016-17 survey of 6-9 year-old children showed that caries experience decreased from 92 percent to 87 percent in this age group from 1999 to 2016- 17, while untreated caries decreased from 73 percent to 47 percent over the same time period . These data represent the first recorded decrease in tooth decay in this age group as well and reflects positively on the ECC Collaborative and the ongoing prevention efforts of the DHP focusing on schoolchildren. Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Centers In recent years, the DHP has utilized field dental program s in conjunction with its Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Centers (DSC) to achieve national performance objectives, support IHS Area initiatives, and support the IHS Strategic Plan for FY 2019-2023. ( Supports IHS S P Objective 1.2 and HHS SP Objective1.2.) The DSCs were designed and implemented in FY 2000 to augment the dental public health infrastructure necessary to best meet the oral health needs of AI/AN communities. The current five- year funding cycle began December 1, 2020, with six DSCs funded through grants and two DSCs funded through program awards. In FY 2021, the Division of Oral Health received an additional $1,000,000 to increase the number of DSCs. This increase in funding will allow for the establishment of a ninth DSC and w ill allow each DSC to have an increased amount of annual funding resulting in an expansion of services to AI/AN communities. Expansion of the DSCs, utilizing best practices learned from programs of the existing DCSs will assist in controlling oral disease and oral health disparities experienced in CJ - 115susceptible or high-risk populations. The primary purpose of a DSC is to provide technical support, training, and assistance in clinical and preventive aspects of dental programs providing care to AI/AN communitie s. As a direct result of the advocacy efforts of the DSCs, the number of key preventive procedures has increased significantly in recent years. For example, the number of dental sealants placed per year has tripled in the last decade, and the number of patients receiving topical fluoride treatments has more than doubled in the last five years. In FY 2013, the DHP began tracking the coverage or prevalence of children and adolescents receiving sealants and topical fluoride, rather than simply counting pro cedures. These assessments allow improved comparisons with data from the U.S. population compiled by the Healthy People 2030 initiative. DSCs were initially funded in FY 2000. In the ensuing years, these DSCs have had an immediate positive impact on the direct delivery of dental care in a number of ways: All centers advocated for an appropriate focus on the dental Government Performance and Results Act ( GPRA) performance objectives to increase specific clinical services. All centers provided continuing education opportunities for clinical staff to enhance the quality of care delivered. Several centers provided on -site clinical and community based program reviews to enhance the quality of care, assuring that field programs maintained a high level of exper tise with respect to challenges such as infection control, preparing for program accreditation and certification reviews, and patient scheduling practices aimed at maximizing access to care. Several centers provided an array of health education materials or designed materials customized to the specific needs of the IHS Areas they serve. These materials have increased the quality and quantity of IHS oral health education efforts throughout Indian Country. Several centers provided or arranged for direct clinical services that otherwise would not have been provided. The aggregate accomplishments of the DSCs have resulted in an increase in clinical preventive care, an increase in overall clinical services, and an enhancement of the quality and quali ty of clinical and community based care delivered by the dental field programs. Dental Health Data Access to dental services is a prerequisite to the control of oral disease in susceptible or high -risk populations. The access to care GPRA objective is aligned with the Healthy People 2030 methodology as a percentage of patients who have visited the dentist within the previous 12 months. ( GPRA measure data supports the IHS S P Objective 1.3 and HHS S P Objective 1.3.) The access to care goal in FY 2019, was 2 7.2 percent and the DHP achieved 30 percent, meeting the goal for the first time in two years and increasing from FY 2017 when the final result was 28.24 percent . Unfortunately, the COVID- 19 pandemic greatly affected dental care to the AI/AN population. Most IHS facilities ceased routine care, including preventive services, beginning in mid-March 2020, and while a few began to re-open routine care in late May 2020, a substantial number of dental facilities continued to provide emergency or s caled back services well into FY 2021. The dentist to population ratio in the IHS system continues to be very low when compared to the ratio in the U.S. private sector. This low dentist to population ratio and an increase in population growth in the AI/AN population will continue to present a challenge in achieving the access rate goal. The IHS has 1,023 dentists (including part -time) in the system, CJ - 116according to the IHS Dental Directory.7 In 2017, there were 2,895,571 AI/AN in the U.S., according to the most recent user population estimate.8 That means that the IHS system has approximately 1 dentist per 2,830 patients served. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were an estimated 153,500 dentists in the U.S. in 20169 serving a population of 325,719,178,10 meaning that there is approximately 1 dentist per 2,122 people served. Topical fluorides and dental sealants have been extensively researched and documented in the dental literature as safe and effective preventive interventions to red uce tooth decay. In FY 2013, the tracking of dental sealants and the tracking of patients receiving topical fluoride measures changed from simple counts of procedures or patients to the percentage of children receiving either sealants or topical fluorides. New annual targets were set for these two objectives as of July 1, 2013. In FY 2019, 32.10 percent of 1-15 year -old children received topical fluoride, an increase from 16.3 percent when this measure was first tracked in FY 2015 , and surpassing the annual goal of 30.0 percent. In FY 2019, 15.9 percent of 2-15 year-old children received sealants, a slight decrease from 16.04 percent in FY 2018, barely missing the national goal of 16 percent. The DHP continues to assess the care pr ovided by its programs through a robust, continuing oral health surveillance program that started in 2010 and is planned through 2025. ( Supports the IHS SP Goal 3: To Strengthen IHS program management and operations through Objective 3.3: Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decision. It also supports the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4: Foster sound, sustained advances in the sciences through HHS Objective 4.1: Improve surveillance, epidemiology, and laborator y services. ) 0-5 year -old AI/AN children were surveyed in 2010, 2014, and 2018-19; 6- 9 year -old children were surveyed in 2011 -12 and 2016-17: 13-15 year-old youth were surveyed in 2013 and 2019- 20; and AI/AN adults were surveyed in 2015. The surveillance program has been used as a model nationally and helps highlight disparities in disease burden and distribution in the AI/AN population. Results of all surveys can be found in data briefs located on the IHS Dental Portal at www.ihs.gov/doh , and data from this surveillance program is also included in the CDC National Oral Health Surveillance System, allowing public health advocates to compare AI/AN disease prevalence with individual state or national data. Dental Health Service Delivery Improvements The DHP has also made significant improvements in the way dental services are delivered. Through the implementation of an electronic dental record (EDR) , over 73 percent of IHS and tribal dental programs have been transitioned to an electronic dental record system that will support the delivery of effective quality dental services. The IHS Dentrix Enterprise (DXE) Electronic Dental Record EDR program has been successfully implemented at 2 59 IHS Federal, Tribal, and Urban dental clinics. The EDR provides accurate data collection and dissemination through the IHS National Data Warehouse. This data supports evaluation of Oral Health Initiatives such as the Early Childhood Caries collaborative and future data development could improve outcome measurements. In FY 2020, the DHP received a $2M appropriation to supplement the DHP-provided funds for the EDR project to complete additional implementations. Despite the pandemic- related travel restrictions, the DHP EDR Implementation and Support contract (EDR Contract) was able to install the IHS version of Dentrix for 5 new locations and expects to add 4 more new EDR implementations by the end of FY 2021.

CJ - 117increased $2 million funding allowed the DHP to assist 64 I/T/U clinics to upgrade to Windows 10 supported Dentrix versions. This upgrade to Windows 10 supported versions is necessary for all 259 IHS Dentrix- using sites to ensure patient data is safely processed and archived. As the funds are expected to be recurring annually, the plan is to enhance the EDR as follows: in addition to the 10 more new EDR implementations each year, the DHP expects to support approximately 60 clinics to upgrade to the Windows 10 supported and most current versions of the IHS D entrix Enterprise EDR system. The additional funding will also be used to enhance reporting capability for the recently developed (FY 2018-2020) IHS individual patient- based Oral Health Status (OHS) metric that allows the local clinic to identify patients in need of urgent and/or preventive oral health care. Additional IHS-specific EDR development in FY 2020 included the development of a capability to generate non- standard [dental] claim formats required by multiple states in order for IHS clinics to rece ive the Medicaid encounter rate reimbursement , the 837i electronic claims form. Further improvements in billing capabilities could increase third party collections. ( Supports IHS SP Goal 3: To Strengthen IHS program management and Operations through Objective 3.3: Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions. It also supports the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5: Promote Effective and Efficient Management and Stewardship through Objective 5.3: Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals.) A second improvement was the release of 20 new dental clinic efficiency and effectiveness standards by which IHS and t ribal dental programs can measure clinical productivity, staffing ratios, and specific clinical efficiency indicators against national averages. A third way the DHP has improved the delivery of care is through the development of new national protocols for the early screening and treatment of periodontal disease in adults. ( The implementation of dental clinical and efficiency standards and the national periodontal health screening protocols support the IHS SP Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capabi lity at all levels of the organization through strategies that focus on providing training, coaching, and mentoring to ensure quality improvement and accountability of staff at all lev els of the organization. These 2 accomplishments also support the HHS S P Objective 1.2: Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encouraging innovation and competition.) A fourth way the DHP has improved the delivery of care is through ongoing support of long- term training (LTT) of general dentist to build the cadre o f dental specialists in the IHS and t ribal dental programs. (The DHP LTT program supports the IHS SP Objective 1.1: Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, and HHS S P Objective1.4: Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs. ) Dentists completing DHP - sponsored LTT to become specialist such as pediatric dentists, periodontists, and endodontists have a service payback obligation to serve AI/AN patients. In the past 6 years, an Oral Maxillofacial Surgeon, an endodontist, six pediatric dentists, and a periodontist have returned from LTT to serve A I/AN patients. A fifth way the DHP is improving the delivery of services is through the adoption of an integrated care model, specifically in promoting depression screenings by dental health providers through a collaboration with the IHS Behavioral Health Program. ( The collaborative efforts between the DHP and the IHS Behavioral Health Program to improve the delivery of service s support the IHS S P Objective 2.1 . These 2 accomplishments also support the HHS S P Objective 1.2: Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encouraging innovation and competition.) The DHP continues to improve the delivery of services is throug h a sustained (20+ years) continuing dental education (CDE) program. The IHS CDE program provides American Dental Association Commission for Continuing Education Provider Recognition approved quality education with almost 300 clinical and public health courses to IHS and t ribal dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, and dental public health leadership. The total number of CDE courses offered has increased from 149 in FY 2014, to 295 in FY 20 20 and, despite numerous cancellations of planned CDE events due to COVID-19, so far 267 were accomplished in CJ - 118FY 2021. Between 201 6 and 2020, a total of over 135,000 hours of CDE were awarded, an estimated value of up to $27 million ($200/hour). During the COVID -19 pandemic, the IHS CDE Program continued to provide vital networking and educational opportunities by shifting from in -person courses to virtual courses, and many of these courses were directly related to this public health emergency, helping provide IHS, tribal, and urban dental programs with the tools and knowledge to reopen their dental programs to provide essential oral health services. In addition, through a concentrated effort to train alternative dental workforce models, since 2016 the CDE Program has trained over 400 dental assistants in expanded functions, thereby increasing productivity and efficiency of IHS and tribal clinics. The models of expanded function dental assistants have been shown to increase access to dental care in the DHP by up to 3.0 percent , increase total services delivered by dental programs up to 5.1 percent , and increase the total services per patient visit by up to 14 percent . (The DHP CDE program supports the IHS SP Objective 2.1 through strategies that focus on providing training, coaching, and mentoring to ensure quality improvement and accountability of staff at all levels of the organization. The DHP continues to evaluate training efforts and staff implementation of improv ements, as appropriate. The DHP CDE program also supports the HHS SP Objective 1.2.) The DHP continues to be on the forefront of hot issues in public health dentistry. Public health issues such as antibiotic stewardship, opioid overdose reversal in dent al settings, managing opioid use disorder through medication -assisted therapy, the growing threat of e- cigarettes in adolescents, community water fluoridation, the new periodontal disease classification standards, improving oral health literacy, issues rel ated to COVID -19 and oral health, silver diamine fluoride, and the U.S. Surgeon General's priorities were all topics addressed by the DHP through continuing education and, in some instances, policy/guideline development. The guidelines are available at the IHS Dental Portal at www.ihs.gov/doh . Another hot issue is the lack of understanding patients have regarding their own oral health, and the DHP has worked to promote oral health literacy through outreach activities and educational materials developed for AI/AN patients through a series of monthly e- mails . (The IHS Pain Management Guidelines and promotion of health literacy support the IHS SP Objective 1.3 and HHS S P Objective 1.3.) COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be ho spitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non- Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID -19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID- 19 Response. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2018 $197,949,000 Budget $287, 326,000 TRIBAL SHARES Dental funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to t ribes when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities, unless otherwise specified in the annual appropriations bill. A portion of the overall Dental budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2022 budget submission for Dental is $287 million which is $ 73 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level . FY 20 21 Base Funding of $215 million will support oral health care services provided by IHS and t ribal programs, maintain the program's progress in raising the quality of and access to oral care through continuing recruitment of oral health care professionals to meet workforce needs, and to meet or exceed agency targets. FY 2022 Funding Increase of $73 million includes : o Current Services : +$11 million for current services including: o Pay Costs +$7 million - to fund pay increases for federal and Tribal employees, of whom approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing health care and related services. o Inflation + $626,000 - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. o Population Growth +$11 million - to fund the additional service needs arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. Staffing for New Facilities +$12 million - These funds will support staffing and operating costs for new and replacement projects listed below. Funding for new/renovated facilities allows IHS to expand provision of health care in those areas where capacity has been expanded to address health care needs.

For a five- year cycle starting December 1, 2020, six grant awards were made, at an annual funding level of $250,000 each, with the purpose being to establish DSC Programs. $1,000,000 of new FY 2021 funding for DSCs will be utilized to increase the number of DSCs, resulting in an expansion of services to AI/AN communities. The DSCs combine IHS and tribal resources and infrastructure in order to address broad challenges and opportunities associated with preventive and clinical dental programs. The DSCs also rigorously measure and evaluate their work with the goal of demonstrably improving dental health outcomes through the technical assistance and services they provide. The DHP has created an online reporting system which will streamline the process by which the DSCs will submit their quarterly progress reports, and will allow the DHP to efficiently collate and analyze DSC achievements. Centers may work simultaneously to improve many different dental programs in a region, providing support, guidance, training, and enhancement to these programs, which then provide services to patients. 11 Interim result. 12 Interim result. 13 Interim result.

The MH/SS program supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2, to provide care that better meets the health care needs of American Indians and Alaska Native communities. The most common MH/SS program model is an outpatient service staffed by one or more mental health professionals providing individual, family, and group psychotherapeutic services and case management. After hour s emergency services are generally provided through local emergency departments a nd contract s with non-IHS hospitals and crisis centers. Inpatient services are generally purchased from non -IHS hospitals or provided by state or county hospitals providing mental health services. Intermediate level services such as group homes, transitional living support, intensive case management, and related activities are typically offered through state and local resources. Additionally, slightly more than one- half of the t ribes administer and deliver their own mental health programs. IHS continu es to support tribal communities in their ability to address the mental health disparities experienced among the AI/AN population. IH S Mental Health initiatives and grant programs support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 that ensures comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible. In partnership with tribal community partners, a collaborative community of learning will support IHS efforts to promote excellence and quality through the develop ment of innovative, community- based projects to expand mental health services and treatment in integrated clinical settings . CJ - 123PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Suicide Prevention: Suicide rates among AI/AN s are historically higher than those of the total U.S. population. In 2018, the suicide rate for AI/AN adolescents and young adults has increased since 2003. AI/AN aged 15 to 34 (19.5 per 100,000) were 1.3 times higher than the national average for that age group (14.5 per 100,000). Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death among all AI/AN across all ages.1 Strategies to address behavioral health, alcohol, substance use disorder, and suicide prevention require comprehensive clinical strategies, and approaches. In 2017, AI/AN adolescents had the highest prevalence (16.3 percent ) of major depressive episode with or without severe impairment compared to other ethnicities. 2 In addition in 2017, AI/AN adults had the highest prevalence (8.0 percent ) of major depressive episode with or without severe impairment compared to other ethnicities.3 Furthermore in 2017, AI/AN adults had the third highest prevalence (18.9 percent) of serious mental illness among U.S. adults compare to other ethnicities. 4 The IHS utilizes and promotes collaborations and partnerships with patients and their families, including t ribes and tribal organizations, Urban Indian organizations, federal, state, and local agencies, as well as public and private organizations. The 2017-2022 National AI/AN Suicide Prevention Strategic Plan advances the 2012 National Suicide Strategic Plan with culturally relevant approaches and strategies specific for AI/AN communities. 5 The IHS is initiating a suicide surveillance data protocol focusing on suicide related behaviors to identify suicide within the IHS Electronic Health Records (EHR) in a standardized and systematic fashion. The suicide surveillance protocol will capture data rela ted to suicide ideation; suicide attempts; and other suicide related behaviors through the use of a universal screening and associated clinical pathways to better understand local facility challenges, identify risk factors and target resources and services appropriately. Ten percent of those who die by suicide had visited the emergency department within 2 months of death . In FY 2019, the IHS and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) partnered by way of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to address the high rates of suicide impacting the AI/AN communities. With this three year partnership (FY 2019 - 2021), IHS and NIH will work together to implement the Ask Suicide Screening Questions (ASQ) and its accompanying toolkit for universal screening wi thin IHS Emergency Departments (EDs) and Primary Care . The ASQ is a suicide screening resource developed by NIMH for medical settings to help nurses 1 US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In FY 2019, IHS conducted a site visit and staff training on the ASQ, and partnered with IHS OIT to fully integrate the validated suicide risk screening instrument into the IHS electronic health records system for field implementation. In FY 2020, IHS began reviewing related surveillance dat a and released the ASQ screening and the associated suicide risk assessment to the field. The implementation of the ASQ has allowed for identification of crisis situations within the pilot sites and supported immediate response by the Area office to ensure quality of care. To date, the pilot sites have registered over 21,000 screenings completed. In addition, due to the impact of COVID -19, suicide screening has increased and has shown an increase in need for behavioral health services such as telehealth and virtual outreach to augment traditional service modalities. These efforts support several IHS Strategic Plan including Goal 1 Objective 1.2 to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships and Goal 3, Objective 3.3 to modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions . Zero Suicide Initiative: In FY 2017, IHS received $3.6 million to fund 8 pilot IHS and tribal sites to participate in its first cohort of the Zero Suicide Initiative. The Zero Suicide\" philosophy is a key concept of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (NSSP) and is a priority of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (Action Alliance). Zero Suicide focuses on developing a system -wide approach to impr oving care for individuals at risk of suicide who are currently utilizing health and behavioral health systems. Health care systems are uniquely poised to identify those struggling with thoughts of suicide considering 50 percent of those who die by suicide had contact with a primary care provider within 1 month of suicide. Furthermore, 80 percent of those who die by suicide had contact with a primary care provider within 1 year of suicide. In FY 2020, ZSI projects trained over 1,015 Staff in evidence based suicide risk/assessment practices and over 8,000 patients received a positive suicide risk screening. Additionally, 100 percent of all ZSI projects established a Suicide Team and developed a Zero Suicide Work Plan. IHS funds eight facilities in total, five tribal and three federal facilities, at $400,000 to implement the Zero Suicide Model within their healthcare system. Each project plan includes utilizing evidence -based treatments in suicide care, initiating safet y plans with patients at risk for suicide, implementing intensive follow -up upon missed or cancelled appointment s, universal suicide screening of all at -risk patients, increasing restriction of lethal means, implementing intensive case management, and initiating follow up with patients within 24 hours of transition of care. In year two all project sites ha ve successfully established a Zero Suicide policy a nd have developed suicide risk screening procedures, clinical pathways, and data collection plans to enhance surveillance and analysis capabilities . Similar to other grant programs, t he COVID -19 pandemic placed an unforeseen hardship on all facilities implementing Zero Suicide in their Emergency Departments . Accordingly, the IHS authorized ZSI grantees one additional project year to continue their approved project activities. The new end date for the ZSI grantees will be October 31, 2021. Finally, i n FY 2021, IHS anticipates funding an additional cohort of Zero Suicide grantees with a primary focus on promoting collaboration with the local, regional and federal health partners. These efforts support several IHS Strategic Plan including Goal 1 Objective 1.2 to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships . CJ - 125Trauma -Informed Care : Trauma Informed Care supports the IHS Strategic Goal 2, Objective 2.2, by providing care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities . IHS has worked to implement the principles of trauma informed care to ensure its system understands the prevalence and impact of trauma, facilitates healing, avoids re-traumatization, and focuses on strength and resilience. Developing and implementing a trauma informed care approach to address childhood trauma, including historical trauma, is necessary to comprehensively address the root causes of violence, suicide, depression, anxiety, self -harm, and chronic physical diseases. In September 2016, the MH/SS and Improving Patient Care and the Johns Hopkins University developed the Pediatric Integrated Care Collaborative (PICC) pilot project. The PICC focus ed on increas ing the quality and accessibility of child trauma services by integrating behavior and physical health services in patient -centered medical homes. Initially, ten PICC pilot sites were selected to attend in -person and virtual quality improvement learning collaborative sessions where they received tailored technical assistance to integrate trauma informed care into pediatric primary care. The goal of the pilot project wa s to harvest lessons learned t hat improve implementation o f screening for trauma among the pediatric population, engaging families, and developing policy recommendations for the Indian health system. In FY 2019, IHS continued to support seven sites established in FY 2018, alongside the previous ly selected tribal and IHS sites to develop a quality improvement model. In addition, these supported sites completed site assessments, developed implementation plans and have shared best and promising practices for trauma informed care. In FY 2020, l essons learned from the PICC were used by I HS to incorporate into a new standalone trauma informed care policy in the Indian Health Manual , accompanied by on-demand online training for clinical and non- clinical staff . In 2019, IHS continued to partner with the University of New Mexico (UNM) to develop an online training curriculum related to tra uma and trauma -informed care tailored for IHS staff, clinical staff, and supervisors. UNM adapt ed the Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC) model to be culturally appropriate and for use with in AI/AN communities. The training seeks to increase staff knowledge of the impact of historical trauma on American Indian/Alaska Native populations, the types of trauma, the impacts of trauma on physical and behavioral health, and the principles and implementation of Trauma Informed Care. The UNM CCTIC is now available as an online on-demand webinar series for clinical and non- clinical staff. The goal of the CCTIC is to facilitate organizational change built around five core values: safety, trustworthiness, choice, colla boration, and empowerment. Staff training focused on recognizing trauma and its impact, becoming trauma informed, treating trauma, and ensuring supervisors at all managerial levels understand the impact of trauma and historical trauma in employee performance, coworker relationships, and well-being. In FY 2021, IHS will expand the training to incorporate additional modules for healthcare professions. Behavioral Health Integration Initiative (BH2I) : IHS supports changing the paradigm of mental health and substance abuse disorder services from being episodic, fragmented, specialty, and/or disease focused to incorporating it into the patient -centered medical home. The statistics facing AI/AN p eoples for suicide, alcohol -related deaths, domestic a nd sexual violence, and homicide require the Indian health system to develop a system of comprehensive screening and effective intervention to reduce morbidity and early mortality. In FY 2017, IHS received $6 million to launch the Behavioral health Integration Initiative, which is on a three-year funding cycle through FY 2020. BH2I supports the IHS Strategic Goal 1, Objective 1.3, to increase access to quality health care services. In FY 2020, IHS continued funding for 12 IHS, tribal, and urban Indian organizations to integrate behavioral health with CJ - 126primary care services in their local health facilities. A primary goal of the BH2I is to formalize integration across the system, develop care teams, strengthen infrastructure, and enhance clinical processes including increased depression screenings in primary care clinics. Additionally, IHS contracted with a technical assistance (TA) provider to guide this pilot project through the implementation of their integrated care efforts with expertise from psychiatrists, primary care physicians, and social workers. The TA provider has also develo ped and implemented a cross - site evaluation of the BH2I initiative to help IHS determine the impact of BH2I. While the initiative focuses on increased implementation of depression screening in primary care clinics, this project will include additional measures that reflect organizational change for behavioral health integration beyond focusing solely on screening r ates. Thus far, BH2I projects have reported successes such as new behavioral health integration policies and procedures including same day access to behavioral health providers within primary care and emergency room settings. Sites have also reported increased screening rates for depression, anxiety, trauma and early childhood development disabilities and reduction in wait times to see a mental health counselor and psychiatrist. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in FY 2020 IHS provided an additional year for all BH2I grantees. This final year will allow flexibility in the project period to complete proposed activities with a focus on meeting the needs of the community as well as developing sustainability plans for their work. In FY 2021, IHS will award approximately 15 new BH2I grantees, which will be on a five-year funding cycle through FY 2026. Additionally, IHS will contract with a technical assistance provider to support grantees with the implementation of integrated care efforts. Reflective of the Agency 's priority to raise the mental health of the AI/AN population, in FY 20 20, IHS report ed 41.1percent of AI/AN adults over the age of 18 screened for depression using a standardized screening assessment for depression. In FY 2020, this same measure was reported for youth ages 12 -17 and data indicated 32.5 percent of eligible youth were screened for depression. For FY 2020 , targets were based on prior year results and results indicate the targets were not met for both measures. T he FY 2022 targets are set in consideration of the most recent results. According to CDC, racial and ethnic minority groups have experienced disparities in mental health and substance misuse related to access to care, psychological stress, and social determinants of health. In FY 2021, IHS partnered with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board to launch a free 24/7 Crisis Text Line for AI/ANs, which includes texting the keywords \"Native\" and \"Indigenous\" to 741-741. The Crisis Text Line connects individuals to a live, trained Crisis Counselor allowing for an increase in access to care and support during the COVID -19 pandemic. TeleBehavioral Health and Workforce Development : The IHS TeleBehavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) was established in 2009, utilizing funds from the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative, to assess the feasibility of providing behavioral health services via televideo. Due to the rural nature of many IHS and t ribal facili ties, I/T/U patients face many issues surrounding access to care, particularly specialty care. P roviders working in these remote areas often face barriers to maintaining the required c ontinuing education (CE) credit s required for licensure and remaining up to date on current clinical guidelines . The TBHCE assists IHS, tribal, and urban Indian organizations providers and facilities in overcoming these challenges by providing a range of telebehavioral health services and virtual training. There are 2 6 sites receiving direct care services through the TBHCE. These services include, adult counseling, child counseling, family counseling, trauma/P ost Traumatic Stress Disorder (P TSD ) counseling, child psychiatry, adult psychiatry, and addiction psychiatry. In FY 2020, the TBHCE provided more than 4,627 hours of telebehavioral health services. CJ - 127 Additionally, the TBCHE host ed webinars designed to meet the specific training needs of IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian (I/T/U) health care providers. More specifically, IHS utilizes tele - education (otherwise known as distance learning) to deliver national continuing education (CE) programming to I/T/U healthcare providers. In FY 2020, TBHCE provided 56 webinars that resulted in 6,100 attendees and 2,124 people receiving CE hours or a certificate of attendance. In FY 2020, to assist communities in their response and recovery efforts due to COVID- 19, IHS hosted 36 webinar trainings with for I/T/U healthcare providers on topics such as adapting behavioral health care services, transitioning to telehealth services, compassion fatigue, self -care, cultural resilience, and supporting the mental health of healthcare providers. In FY 2021, IHS will support the new trauma informed care policy by developing on-demand online training for clinical and non- clinical staff. This training will provide guidance to IHS facilities in delivering trauma -informed care services along with promoting self- care to prevent secondary traumatic stress, which can lead to compassion fatigue and burnout. Finally , TBHCE developed and maintains the online IHS Essential Training on Pain and Addiction. In FY 2020, 355 I/T/U providers completed this five-hour training. Additionally, 289 I/T/U providers completed the TBHCE hosted Essential Training on Pain and Addict ion Refresher course. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be hospitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non- Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID -19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID- 19 Response.

Direct Federal; P.L. 93-638 Self- Determination contracts and compacts, Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Alcohol and substance abuse and addiction are among the most severe public health and safety problems facing American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals, families, and communities. The purpose of the Indian Health Service (IHS) Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is to raise the health status of AI/AN communities to th e highest possible level through a comprehensive array of preventive, educational, and treatment services that are community-driven and culturally competent. The ASAP addresses the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2 by building, strengthening, and sustaining collaborative relationships with I/T/Us and 1.3 increasing access to quality health care services. These collaborative activities strive to integrate substance abuse treatment into primary c are. For instance, the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program provides prevention and intervention resources developed and delivered by local community partners to address the dual crises of substance abuse and suicide in AI/AN communities. In general, AI/AN populations suffer disproportionately from substance use disorders (SUD) compared with other racial groups in the United States. Research has consistently found that AI/AN experience higher rates of substance use compared with the U.S. general population. Findings from the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reported the rate of AI/ANs with an alcohol use disorder (7.2 percent ) is higher than that of the total population (5.1 percent ).1 In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the AI/AN population had the second highest overdose rates from all opioids (15.7 deaths/ 100,000 population), and the highest rate from prescription opioids (7.2 deaths/100,000 population) during 2016-2017. The overall rate of overdose deaths for AI/ANs increased by 13 percent between 2015-2017. In 2017, the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths was 9.6 percent higher than the rate for 2016. During that time, deaths rose more than 500 percent among AI/ ANs. Due to 1 https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt23246/1_AIAN_2020_01_14_508.pdf CJ - 132misclassification of race and ethnicity on death certificates, the actual number of deaths for AI/ANs may be underestimated by up to 35 percent.2 The services and functions of the IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse program supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 to provide care to better meet the health care needs of AI/AN communities and Goal 1 to ensure comprehensive, culturally appropriate services in the prevention, treatment and recovery of alcohol and substance use disorders . PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS As alcohol and substance abuse treatment and prevention have transitioned from IHS direct care services to local community control via t ribal contracting and compacting, IHS' role has shifted to providing support to enable communities to plan, develop, and implement culturally informed programs. Organized to develop programs and program leadership, the major IHS ASAP activities and focus areas are: Integrated Substance Abuse Treatment in Primary Care : IHS continues to support the integration of substance abuse treatment into primary care and acute care services. Integrating treatment into ambulatory health care offers immediate and same- day opportunities for health care providers to identify patients with substance use disorders, provide them with medical advice, help them communicate the health risks and consequences, obtain substance abuse consultations, and refer patients with more severe substance use- related problems to treatment. 3 One integration activity is the implementation of the Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) instrument . SBIRT is an early intervention and treatment service for people with substance use disorders and those at risk of developing these disorders. IHS has broadly promot ed SBIRT as an integral part of a sustainable, primary care- based activity that aims to support and int egrate behavioral health into overall care. SBIRT is eligible for reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). IHS has incorporated SBIRT as a national measure to be tracked and reported. In FY 2020, the SBIRT screening measure was utilized in 14.8 percent of the patient visits for those between ages 9 through 75. The target for this measure was 12.2 percent, therefore IHS efforts exceeded the expected percent of patients to be screened using the SBIRT. At the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic, IHS increased efforts to expand telehealth capacity across I/T/ Us to continue coordination of treatment and services to patients. Additionally, IHS continues to monitor the SBIRT administered through telehealth methods. IHS continues to provide annual national training on SBIRT including guidelines for improved clinical documentation in the electronic health record. In FY 2020, IHS continues to increase efforts that broadly promote the SBIRT measure to achieve targets at the regional and local levels including a more focused education campaign on the importance of early detection and intervention using SBIRT screening among IHS operated programs. In addition, the IHS is actively working to expand local SBIRT measures to include a focu s on substance use in women of childbearing age to assist in early identification and referral for treatment for risky use and to reduce illicit perinatal substance exposure for infants. Increasing access to Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) : The In dian Health Service is committed to assuring access to Medication Assisted Treatment for patients struggling with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) . The IHS continues to host training sessions for clinicians to receive their Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) 2000 waiver to prescribe buprenorphine and 2 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/ss/pdfs/ss6619.pdf 3 U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy. Integrating Treatment into Healthcare. Available at http://ww w.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/integrating -treatment -and-healthcare. IHS National Core Formulary. In FY20, the IHS continues to evaluate new long- acting MAT therapies for inclusion on the National Core Formulary and creates formulary briefs and technical assistance to incorporate these new treatments into practice. In June 2019, the IHS released the Special General Memorandum Assuring Access to MAT that requires Federal Indian Health Service Facilities to create an action plan to identify local MAT resources and coordinate patient access to these services when indicated to assure equitable access to MAT services. In addition, the IHS has created workforce development strategies that include SUD training for healthcare workers and technical assistance materials to support sites with creating integrated SUD approaches to care. These efforts have resulted in a 37 percent in buprenorphine prescriptions between 2018-2019. To address challenges that limit access to recovery services in remote and rural IHS locations and villages, the IHS released an Internet Eligible Controlled Substance Prescriber Designation (IECSP) Policy in the Indian Health Manual (Chapter 38) to assure access to MAT using telemedicine models for remotely located Tribal members. In January 2020, an IHS telehealth toolkit for MAT services was created and shared on the ihs.gov/opioids website. These resources assist prescribers and sites with creating tele -MAT services and implementing provisions within the IECSP policy. Additionally, a webinar was hosted in February 2020 to describe available MAT resources and policies. In March 2019, the IHS released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on American Indian/Alaska Native Pregnant Women and Women of Childbearing Age with Opioid Use Disorder developed in collaboration with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) Committee on American Indian and Alaska Native Women's Health. This resource will help providers improve maternal participation in early prenatal care, improve screening for substance use disorder, and increase access to MAT for pregnant women and women of child- bearing age. The goal of these clinical recommendations is to foster relationships and improve awareness surrounding trauma-informed approaches to maternal opioid use that may lead to recovery, hope, and healing. Additionally, the IHS and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Native American Child Health (CONACH) recently released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome that includes clinical recommendations on the prevention and management of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. These recommendations provide standards of care for screening, diagnosing, support, and treatment of pregnant mothers and infants affected by prenatal opioid exposure The IHS has also partnered with the Northwest Portland A rea Indian H ealth B oard and the Clinician Consultation Center to facilitate I /T/U clinician access to free Substance Disorder tele- consultation services. These services are intended to assist clinicians with patient treatment planning, facilitate didactic learning, and provide support for health systems that desire to create local protocols. The IHS has expanded access to harm reduction interventions that include increased access to the opioid overdose reversal medication, naloxone. In 2015, the IHS signed a memorandum of agreement with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The agreement allows IHS to provide BIA Law Enforcement Officers (LEO) with training and naloxone rescue kits for responding to incidents of opioid overdose. Between 2015 and 2017, this partnership trained and put naloxone in the hands of 324 BIA LEOs, who are often the first responders to incidents of opioid overdose in Tribal communities. In 2017, IHS turned the naloxone training program over to the BIA after certifying 48 BIA LEOs as naloxone trainers. The IHS continues to support this program by re- supplying naloxone rescue kits to BIA LEO first responders as needed. In 2019, IHS conducted first-responder train -the-trainer sessions on naloxone and harm reduction strategies for CJ - 134community health worker s from IHS and tribal sites from across the country. During that training 86 community workers were supplied with naloxone kits and certified to offer naloxone training within their local communities. The IHS also supports naloxone co-prescribing and has created sample collaborative practice agreements to engage pharmacists in naloxone distribution efforts and has hosted an IHS 'Grand Rounds' on naloxone co- prescribing to increase this life-saving procedure. A \"First Responder Toolk it\" that includes a training video, a law enforcement testimonial video, customizable forms, and a train- the trainer curriculum was created to support naloxone deployment in tribal communities. The IHS formally expanded access to naloxone in March 2018 through a policy titled \"Prescribing and Dispensing of Naloxone to First Responders\" that require IHS Federal pharmacies to provide naloxone to all Tribal law enforcement agencies and other trained first responders. These efforts have resulted in a 143 perc ent increase in naloxone procurement across IHS facilities that utilize the Prime Vendor. The IHS has further adapted the toolkit and strategy to equip community first responders and paraprofessionals with training on opioid overdose response and naloxone . These expanded collaborations with local law enforcement and community first responders resulted in an initial pilot community -health naloxone train-the-trainer program to include naloxone distribution. In addition to the naloxone distribution, the I HS expanded harm reduction strategies to include an evaluation of Safe Syringe Services. In FY 2020, IHS will develop and release a Safe Syringe Services toolkit that includes sample patient education pamphlets, a review of available resources, and inform ation related to creating program financial sustainability. These expanded harm reduction services will support IHS Hepatitis C Elimination and HIV/AIDS efforts Proper Pain Management , Opioid Stewardship and Training: The IHS has created and released a comprehensive Opioid Stewardship workbook to assist sites with creating best practices surrounding safe opioid prescribing and increasing access to integrative pain treatments. The workbook emphasizes utilizing opioid surveillance strategies to evaluate population health outcomes, target opioid interventions, enhance clinical decision support, and create professional practice evaluation strategies. The IHS opioid stewardship program evaluation considers metrics that evaluate trends in Morphine Milligram Equivalents versus a restricted focus on total opioid prescription fills. A total of fifteen opioid prescribing metric definitions have been proposed for inclusion in the IHS Opioid Prescribing dashboard. Finally, the Opioid Prescribing dashboard development phase was completed in FY 2020 with release and roll -out anticipated in FY 2021. The IHS has also increased access to non -pharmacologic pain management approaches. The IHS has collaborated with the Defense Veter ans Center for Integrated Pain Management to expand access to focused auricular acupuncture through the creation of sample credentialing and privileging processes, protocols, documentation standards, and sustainability recommendations. Access to addition al integrative pain management strategies such as dry needling, deep tissue mobilization, and electrical stimulation have increased. The IHS has created agency policy and clinical practice recommendations to improve patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary opioid exposure. In June 2014, the IHS implemented Indian Health Manual Chapter 30 policy titled Chronic Non- Cancer Pain Management to promote appropriate pain management with revision in 2018 to align with CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. This policy will be revised in FY 20 to include enhanced recommendations related to de -prescribing and medical cannabis. The impact of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) on safe opioid prescribing is well documented. The IHS CJ - 135implemented Chapter 32 State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs requiring providers to check state PDMP data bases prior to prescribing opioids and requiring IHS federal pharmacies to report opioid prescribing data to these state PDMPs. Ongoing improvements to automate reporting electronic integration and audit reporting are planned for FY 2021. The IHS has also addressed acute pain prescri bing through the development of clinical guidelines to assist dentists with selecting the safest pain control option. The Recommendations for Management of Acute Dental Pain will limit opioid prescribing for patients who cannot safely use alternative pain medication. The guidelines also include a decision tree for pre- and post- operative pain management, as well as recommended dosage limits for analgesics based on the degree of anticipated operative pain. The IHS has also created a robust workforce development strategy to include didactic training. In September 2019, the IHS launched its Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder Continuing Medical Education webinar series. The IHS has hosted learning sessions in this series that include buprenorphine pre scribing in pregnancy, dental acute pain management recommend as well as an auricular acupuncture- training program. Imple menting an Integrated MAT Model -A Review of Resources, Assessment and Treatment of Pain and Co -occurring OUD In Individual with Serious Mental Illness, and Treatment of OUD in the ED, Should it be a Choice? In May 2016, the IHS implemented a policy on mandatory opioid training requiring all federally controlled substance prescribers to complete the \"IHS Essential Training on Pain and Addiction\" with required refresher training every 3 years. This training is now available on demand with continuing medical education credits. The IHS released its Refr esher training course in January 2018 including four sessions of its mandatory five-hour training course for providers on proper opioid prescribing. In FY 2019, 302 new clinicians completed this course. The mandate also includes an additional refresher t raining after three years. In FY 2019, 7251 clinicians completed the Essential Training on Pain and Addiction Refresher course. In FY 2020, course content was updated based on prescriber evaluation. These revisions include expanded modules on managing pain in special populations (e.g., older adults, pregnancy, SUD) as well as content on effective de- prescribing strategies. Improved Communication Related to Opioid Strategies: Enhanced communication during the opioid crisis response is vital to program development, policy implementation, and ongoing evaluation. The IHS creat ed and released an Opioid Information Sheet that will serve as a public-facing logic model to share opioid- related measure, agency goals, and available resources for both clinicians and tribal stakeholders. The IHS opioid strategy and a host of available resources is ho used on IHS HOPE Committee web page that support a unified user experience in addition to publication of a quarterly opioid newsletter (https://www.ihs.gov/opioids/hope/). In FY2020, the IHS expanded websites to include a new technical assistance page that will share best and promising practices related to clinical documentation, sample documentation templates and How-to guides, and links to clinician supports. Future content consolidation will include funding opportunities and promising clinical practices. In FY 2020, IHS provided Pain Skills Intensive trainings in the Phoenix and Tucson Area and the Navajo Area. These trainings focus on assessment and treatment of myofascial pain, including non-pharmacological interventions. Additionally, they include the half -and- half DATA Waiver training for buprenorphine MAT. A total of 35 clinicians attended these trainings In FY 2020, IHS provided three webinars that addressed pain management, opioids, and opioid misuse with a total of 326 attendees. CJ - 136 Implementing an Integrated MAT Model- A Review of Resources Assessment and Treatment of Pain and Co -occurring OUD In Individual with Serious Mental Illness Treatment of OUD in the ED, Should it be a Choice? The IHS has created agency policy and clinical practice recommendations to improve patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary opioid exposure. In June 2014, the IHS implemented IHM Chapter 30 policy titled Chronic Non-Cancer Pain Management to promote appropriate pain management. Finally, t he Indian Health Service released new clinical guidelines to assist dentists with selecting the safest pain control options. The Recommendations for Management of Acute Dental Pain will limit opioid prescribing to patients who cannot safely use alternative pain medication. The guidelines also include a decision tree for pre- and post-operative pain management, as well as recommended dosing of systemic analgesics based on anticipated operative pain. Pain and Opioid Use Disorder Case Consultation Services: To provide ongoing clinical support for providers, IHS, in partnership with the University of New Mexico Pain Center, provides a weekly Chronic Pain and Opioid Management ECHO. ECHO is a case-based learning model in which consultation is offered through virtual clinics to primary care clinicians by an expert team to share knowledge and elevate the level of specialty care available to patients. In FY 2019, 178 IHS, tribal, and urban clinicians participated in 34 ECHO sessions with over 1,000 attendees. Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTCs) : YRTCs are facilities which provide medically managed care, including detoxification, and other es sential treatment and recovery services to AI/AN youth experiencing substance use disorders.. Congress authorized the establishment of YRTCs in each of the 12 IHS Areas, with two (northern and southern) specifically authorized for the California Area. The YRTCs provide quality holisti c behavioral health care for AI/AN adolescents that integrate traditional healing, spiritual values and cultural identification. In FY 20 20 all federal YRTCs in operation 18 months or longer have achieved accreditation status. COVID -19 significantly imp acted service delivery across all YRTCs . In response to the challenges YRTCs experienced to maintain facility operations, YRTCs partnered with the IHS, SAMHSA's Office of T ribal Affairs and Policy and the Addic tion Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network Coordinating Office to identify and develop r esponse and recovery resources specific to YRTCs continuity of care. This document \"Guidance for Caring for Patients in Youth Regional Treatment Centers During the COVID -19 Pandemic\" was developed to support the delivery of care among the YRTCs during this ever -evolving situation . Indian Children's Program (formerly, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD)): Training and technical assistance on FASD is provided through the IHS Tel eBehavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) Indian Children Program (ICP). The focus of the ICP is training clinicians on developmental and neurobiological issues that can affect AI/AN children. To this end, ICP developed and posted a nine- session tra ining series on FASD in AI/AN populations. ICP is currently piloting a four-hour, introductory course on FASD and another course on Autism Spectrum Disorder. The target audience of these trainings are Community Health Representatives, school staff, and other community members. In FY 2019, ICP produced a nine- session training series, Substance Use and the Adolescent Brain. The ICP also provides additional clinician supports. For example, clinicians can take advantage of the bi -weekly, Pediatric Neurodevelopmental & Behavioral Health Consultation Clinic. This virtual clinic is designed to help clinicians successfully diagnose, manage, and/or treat AI/AN youth with FASD, ASD, and other neurodevelopmental issues. CJ - 137Information Systems Supporting Behavioral Health Care : The Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) includes functionality designed to meet the unique business processes of behavioral health ( BH) providers and support BH- related initiatives. Standardized instruments and clinical decision support tools are available to support routine and effec tive screening for alcohol and substance use, depression, domestic violence and smoking status. Additionally, surveillance tools are available to capture suicide data at the point of care. Aggregate national RPMS behavioral health data is maintained to s upport local, national and other program reporting requirements as well as quality performance measurements for numerous screening and prevention initiatives including screening for alcohol and substance use, depression, domestic violence, smoking, and sui cide data collection. Partnerships: IHS is collaborating with other agencies working in the field of substance disorders such as S ubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services A dministration (SAMHSA ), Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Resources and Ser vices Administration, Office of National Drug Control Policy, and CMS to ensure that the best available information, training s, protocols, evaluations, performance measures, data needs, and management skills are incorporated and shared with all agencies an d organizations working on substance use disorders. The Department of the Interior (DOI) through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and the IHS ha ve a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention, which was amended in 2011 as a result of the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Through this MOA, BIA, BIE, and IHS coordinate and implement plans in cooperation with t ribes to assist t ribal governments in their efforts to address behavioral health issues. The MOA includes coordination of data collection, resources, and programs of IHS, BIA, and BIE. The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) r equires interagency coordination and collaboration among HHS (IHS and SAMHSA), DOI (BIA/BIE), Department of Justice (Office of Justice Programs/Office of Tribal Justice), and the Office of the Attorney General. The coordination of Federal efforts and resources will assist in determining both the scope of alcohol and substance abuse problems as well as effective prevention and treatment programs. The MOA required by Section 241 of the TLOA was signed on July 29, 2011, by the Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services and the Interior and the Attorney General to: (1) determine the scope of the alcohol and substance abuse problems faced by t ribes; (2) identify and delineate the resources each entity can bring to bear on the problem; (3) set s tandards for applying those resources to the problems; and (4) coordinate existing agency programs. In April 2019, the IHS expanded collaboration with the Defense Veterans Center for Integrated Pain Management to explore feasibility of creating an IHS auricular acupuncture program utilizing the Veterans Health Administration Battlefield Acupuncture proto col. The IHS has created a pilot program that includes credentialing and privileging processes, clinical practice protocols, documentation standards, patient education materials, and a sustainability plan. The initial training session was hosted in Novem ber 2019 and 23 IHS clinicians were certified in this modality. Ninety -six community-health workers completed training as naloxone trainers for their tribal communities in one week. CJ - 138ASA Grant and Federal Award Programs The IHS Division of Behaviora l Health administers community- based grants and cooperative agreements that promote the use and development of evidence- based and practice- based models that represent culturally -appropriate prevention and treatment approaches to substance ab use from a comm unity-driven context. In particular, the IHS Community Opioid Intervention Pilot Program and the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention program (SASP) will support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2 to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships and Objective 1.3 to increase access to quality health care services. IHS Community Opioid Intervention Pilot Program (COIPP) : In FY 2021, IHS awarded $16 Million in funding to combat the opioid epidemic in American Indian and Alaska Native communities . The IHS Community Opioid Intervention Pilot program awarded 35 grants to support the development of innovative, locally -designed, culturally-appropriate prevention, treatment, recovery, and aftercare services for opioid use disorders. Awarded projects will focus on increasing public awareness and education about the impact of opioid use disorder on individuals, families and communities. Grantees will also create comprehensive support teams to strengthen and empower families address ing the opioid crisis. Finally, all projects will prioritize efforts to reduce unmet needs and opioid overdose deaths through increased access to medication assisted treatment. The IHS Community Opioid Intervention Pilot is a three year program and part of the Department of Health and Human Services' five- point strategy to fight the opioid overdose epidemic in America. Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program (SASP): The SASP is a nationally -coordinated $31.97 million program providing funds for culturally appropriate substance use and suicide prevention programming in AI/AN communities. The program funds 174 projects . IHS administration of the SASP grants supports the HHS Strategic Plan, Goal 2 to protect the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play. In August of 201 9, IHS initiated Tribal Consultation and an Urban Confer regarding behavioral health initiatives and the National Tribal Advisory Committee on Behavioral Health recommendations regarding the distribution of funding for the SASP program. In total 22 comments and recommendations were received and reviewed by IHS . On March 2, 2020, the IHS Director issued a decision to continue distribution the SASP program funds using a competitive grant mechanism. However, d ue to the COVID -19 pandemic, the SASP notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) originally set to be released in Spring 2020, will be published in FY2021. The goals of SASP are to: 1. Increase IHS, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) capacity to operate successful substance abuse prevention, treatment, and aftercare and/or suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention services through implementing community and organizational needs assessment and strategic plans; 2. Develop and foster data sharing systems among I/T/U behavioral health service providers to demonstrate efficacy and impact; 3. Identify and address suicide ideations, attempts, and contagions among AI/AN populations through the development and implementation of culturally appropriate and community relevant prevention, intervention, and postvention strategies; 4. Identify and address substance use among AI/AN populations through the development and implementation of culturally appropriate and community relevant prevention, treatment, and aftercare strategies; CJ - 1395. Increase pro vider and community education on suicide and substance use by offering appropriate trainings; and 6. Promote positive AI/AN youth development and family engagement through the implementation of early intervention strategies to reduce risk factors for suicidal behavior and substance use. SASP projects were awarded funding in at least one of four purpose areas and work to address the corresponding SASP goal listed above. SASP Purpose Areas are: 1. Community Needs Assessment and Strategic Planning; 2. Suicide Prevention, Intervention, and Postvention; 3. Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Aftercare; and 4. Generation Indigenous (Gen- I) Initiative Support. Of the projects funded, 19 projects specifically focus on substance use prevention, treatment, and aftercare, while 107 focus on substance use and suicide prevention among Native youth. IHS established the Universal Alcohol Screening (UAS) as a national measure to increase screening and improve detection and intervention strategies among patient s' ages 9 through 75 years of age. In FY 2020, 33.8 percent of eligible patients were screened for risky alcohol use. In 2020, the pandemic impacted IHS primary care and emergency departments clinical settings, therefore the IHS did not meet the expected screening target of 42.4.0 percent. The SASP program had an anticipated project period ending on September 29, 2020. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the majority of the 174 SASP projects reduced and/or ceased activities. Only a limited number of projects continued to operate and did so according to their local, state, and federal guidelines for COVID-19 by modifying in-person activities to virtual events. In June 2020 , the IHS requested and received a 1 -year extension for all SASP grants from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) due to the impact of COVID-19. The new end date for all SASP grants will be September 29, 2021. In the fourth year, 100 percent of projects submitted progress reports as a requirement of funding. Positive strides in the delivery of substance use services have been accomplished and reported in preliminary data monitoring for SASP program activities. Successful outcomes during the fourth year of the program include expanded behavioral health services offered through school settings and home visiting with a total of 1,475 patients receiving care. Over 270 providers were trained in behavioral health integration with 163 of those providers locate d within a primary care setting . Project accomplishments include 67,168 individuals screen for suicide ideation, 54 percent of the SASP program suicide prevention projects implemented an enhance d process for suicide screening, and over 11,003 community members have been trained in suicide and/or substance use prevention . Fifty three percent of projects hosted a successful prevention education community event, and 59 percent reported their traini ngs to have expanded staff knowledge (a 12 percent increase from year 2) . Twenty nine percent reported implementation and documentation of a system change. In addition, among projects supported, a total of 76,054 individuals received cultural services, a high percentage of projects have continued to offer integrated traditional healing into care, extended service hours, provision of follow- up care, new counseling and case management services. In summary, the SASP program continues to support tribes, tribal organizations, urban Indian organizations, and federal facilities offering care. Preventing Alcohol -Related Death s (PARD) : In the 2017 Senate Appropriations Committee Report 114-281, the Committee directed IHS to \"allocate $2,000,000 of the increase provided for the alcohol and substance abuse program to fund essential detoxification and related services.\" CJ - 140Specifically, in th e report the number of alcohol related deaths in the community of Gallup, New Mexico was addressed with the report stating, \"these deaths underscore the urgent need for substance abuse treatment, residential services and detoxification services\" in this co mmunity. In response, the IHS used the increased appropriated funds to address the urgent need in the city of Gallup, New Mexico. In addition to Gallup, New Mexico, IHS was aware of the urgent need for alcohol detoxification services in the Great Plains Area after the removal of liquor licenses and alcohol sales in White Clay, Nebraska, leading to the potential for increased mortality if services were unavailable for alcohol detoxification. As a result, funds were also made available to address this urge nt need. The funds provided to Gallup, New Mexico and the Great Plains Area (specifically the Oglala Sioux Tribe) to address the need for social detox ification services were made available in FY 2017 through a competitive cooperative agreement. The fundi ng announcement was released in FY 2017 and two projects were selected and funded. The project period is for 5 years and will run from September 15, 2017, to September 14, 2022. With the additional funding, the Gallup NM site reported detoxification serv ices to 9,482 unique individuals with over 75 percent of those clients including males. In addition to services offered for monitoring, supervising and managing detoxification, this site has increased coordination and transportation with the Emergency Department ; and establish ed a contract with the Gallup Police Department to transport patients to the detoxification center. The Great Plains' site has used the funding to increase coordination with behavioral health programs, provide screenings and brief interventions to individuals incarcerated in jails, and serve as an immediate placement for individuals who are in need of treatment services following detoxification. In FY2020, the nearly 100 percent of individuals held in detoxification for more than two weeks were successfully admitted into a higher level of residential treatment care for their SUD. While services were temporarily interrupted at the City of Gallup detoxification site, the PARD site in the Great Plains Area was able to continue operations. IHS continues to work with both sites to ensure each has adopted guidelines provided by the local and state health departments, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. YRTC Aftercare Pilot Project: In December 2017, IHS utilized $1.8 million to implement a pilot project for aftercare services for AI/AN youth discharged from residential substance abu se treatment. The Project focus is to identify appropriate aftercare services that can be culturally adapted to support AI/AN youth in their recovery journey once they leave YRTC care. Two YRTCs , Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center and Healing Lodge of the Seven Nations , were selected and to develop approaches to aftercare, recovery, and other support services for AI/AN youth that can be used across other YRTCs. These facilities are tasked with implementing best practices around effective reintegration processes while establishing a collaborative partnership community-based approach to reduce alcohol and substance use relapse. With the additional funding the two YRTCs have engaged tribal and urban programs that refer adolescents to the YRTCs , to identify best practices for aftercare. This has resulted in improved coordination around aftercare and case management, increased training of community supports for the adolescents, improved identification of transitional living, increased awareness of the use of social media, and improved follow -up with data collection after discharge. Best practices and lessons learned from the YRTC Aftercare Pilot Project will directly support discharge recommendations and guidance in the \"Guidance for Caring for Patients in Youth Regional Treatment Centers During the COVID -19 Pandemic\" document. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 CJ - 141times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be ho spitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non- Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID -19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID- 19 Response. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount SASP I 2018 $224,188,000 ($16,500,000) TRIBAL SHARES Alcohol and Substance Abuse funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to tribes when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities, unless otherwise specified in the annual appropriations bill . A portion of the overall Alcohol and Substance Abuse budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2022 budget submission for Alcohol and Substance Abuse is $267 million, which is $ 16 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level. FY 20 21 Base Funding of $251 million - This funding will maintain the program's progress in addressing alcohol and substance abuse needs by improving access to behavioral health services through tele-behavioral health efforts and providing a comprehensive array of preventive, educational, and treatment services. FY 2021 Funding Increase of $16 mi llion includes: Current Services : +$9 million for current services including: o Pay Costs +$4 million - to fund pay increases for federal and Tribal employees, of whom approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing health care and related services. o Inflation +$790,000 - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. o Population Growth +$4 million - to fund the additional service needs arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. CJ - 142 Staffing for New Facilities: +$ 2 million - These funds will support staffing and operating costs for new and replacement projects listed below. Funding for new/renovated facilities allows IHS to expand provision of health care in those areas where capacity has been expanded to address health care needs.

Direct Federal, PL 93- 638 Tribal Contracts and Compacts, Commercial contracts, and Tribal shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Snyder Act provides the formal legislative authority for the expenditure of funds for the \"relief of distress and conservation of health of Indians.\"1 In 1934, Congress provided the specific authority to enter into medical services contracts for American Indians and Alaska Natives.2 These, among other authorities3 established the basis for the Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Program.4 The PRC Program is integral to ensure comprehensive health care services are available and accessible to eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) (IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 ). The Indian health system delivers care through direct care services provided in an IHS, Tribal or Urban Indian Health Program (I/T/U) facility (e.g., hospitals, clinics) and through PRC services delivered by non-IHS providers to increase access to quality health care services (IHS Strategic Plan 1.3) . The general purpose of the PRC Program is for IHS or Tribal facilities to purchase services from private health care providers in situations where: 1) No IHS or Tribal direct care facility exists, 2) The direct care element is not capable of providing required emergency and/or specialty care, 3) The direct care element has an overflow of medical care workload, and 4) Full expenditure of alternate resources (e.g., Medicare, private insurance) has been met and supplemental funds are necessary to provide comprehensive care to eligible Indian people. In addition to meeting the eligibility requirements for direct services at an IHS or Tribal facility, PRC eligibility is determined based on residency within the service unit or Tribal PRC delivery Area; 1 The Snyder Act, Public Law 67-85, November 2, 1921, 25 U.S.C \u00a7 13. 2 The Johnson O'Malley Act of April 16, 1934, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 452. 3 Transfer Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2001; Indian Health Care Improvement Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C \u00a7 1601, et seq. 4 The Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2014, Public Law 113-76, January 18, 2014, adopted a new name for the IHS Contract Health Services (CHS) program to Purchased/Referred Care (PRC). The IHS will administer PRC in accordance with all law applicable to CHS. CJ - 145 authorization of payment for each recommended medical service by a PRC authorizing official; medical necessity of the service and inclusion within the established Area IHS/Tribal medical/dental priorities; and full expenditure of all alternate resources (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, state or other health programs, etc.). Alternate resources must pay for services first because the IHS PRC Program is the payer of last resort.5 Services purchased may include hospital, specialty physician, outpatient, and laboratory, dental, radiological, pharmaceutical, or transportation services. When funds are not sufficient to purchase the volume of PRC services needed by the eligible population residing in the PRC delivery area of the local facility, IHS PRC regulations require IHS or Tribal PRC programs to use a medical priority system to fund the most urgent referrals first. Medical priority (MP) levels of care are defined as follows: MP Level I: Emergent or Acutely Urgent Care Services are defined as threats to life, limb and senses. MP Level II: Preventive Care Services are defined as primary health care that is aimed at the prevention of disease or disability. MP Level III: Specialty Services are considered ambulatory care which include inpatient and outpatient care services. MP Level IV: Chronic Tertiary and Extended Care Services are defined as requiring rehabilitation services, skilled nursing facility care. MP L evel V: Excluded Services are services and procedures that are considered purely cosmetic in nature, i.e., plastic surgery . A PRC rate, a capitated rate based on Medicare payment methodology, is used to purchase care, and Medicare participating hospitals are required to accept this rate as payment in full for all hospital -based health care services (Public Law 108- 173). This allows IHS to purchase care at a lower cost than if each service were negotiated individually increasing access to quality health care services and provide care to better meet the health care needs of AI/ANs ( IHS Strategic Plan 1.3.4 - Increase access to quality community, direct, specialty, long- term care and support services, and referred health care services and identify barriers to care for AI /AN stakeholders ). Physician and non-hospital providers of supplies and services are purchased at the PRC rate. However, if a physician or non -hospital provider does not accept the PRC capitated rate, agreements or contracts can be negotiated with individual providers of supplies or services using the provider's most favored customer rate as a ceiling for negotiation (42 CFR 136 Subpart I) (IHS Strategic Plan 3.2.7 - Develop policies, use tools, and apply models that ensure efficient use of assets and resources). Program funds are administered and managed at IHS Headquarters, at each of the 12 IHS Areas, and at IHS and Tribal facilities across the nation. The regulation has demonstrated that IHS is able to stretch the same amount of money to cover additional necessary health care services and improve access to care. This meets the IHS Str ategic Plan Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people . Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services. The PRC P rogram also administers the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF). Created in 1988, the CHEF was established for the sole purpose of meeting extraordinary medical costs associated with treatment of victims of disasters or catastrophic illnesses. 6The CHEF is used to reimburse PRC programs for high cost cases (e.g., burn victims, motor vehicle crashes, high risk obstetrics, cardiology, etc.) after a threshold payment amount is met, the current threshold is $25,000. The CHEF is centrally managed at IHS Headquarters. The PRC Program contracts with a fiscal intermediary (FI), currently Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New 525 U.S.C. CJ - 146 Mexico, to ensure payments are made in accordance with IHS' payment policy, and coordinate benefits with other payers to maximize PRC resources. (IHS Strategic Plan 3.2.7 - Develop policies, use tools, and apply models that ensure efficient use of assets and resources ) All IHS-managed PRC programs and some tribally -managed PRC programs use the FI to ensure the use of PRC rates for inpatient services and PRC or negotiated rates for physician and non-hospital providers of supplies and services. PRC funding provides critical access to essential health care services and remains a top request by Tribes in the budget formulation recommendations. ( IHS Strategic Plan 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services) Note: On February 28, 2019, IHS updated the Indian Health Manual, Part 2, Services to Indians and Others, Chapter 3, Purchased/Referred Care. In this IHM update IHS adopted the policy that PRC funds may be used for staff administrating the PRC program at administrative levels. This adopts the GAO recommendation for the use of PRC funds for PRC staff where appropriate. This policy change requir es Areas to ensure they are funding requests through Priority Level II before these PRC administrative expenses can be charged. This policy meets the ( IHS Strategic Plan 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce.) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Rates - The PRC rates for all hospital -based services implemented in 2007 and the PRC rates for physicians and non- hospital providers of supplies and services implemented in 2016 have increased access to care by allowing I/T/Us to purchase additional services with these Medicare methodology capitated rates, referred to as PRC rates. PRC rates were originally referred to as Medicare- like rates (MLR) for hospital based services but are now identified as PRC rates. PRC rates are based on the Medicare payment methodology for all hospital based services, physician and non-hospital providers of supplies and services. The PRC rates rule (42 CFR 136 Subpart I) for physicians and non-hospital providers of supplies and services applies to I/T/Us but only to the extent the tribally -operated PRC programs agree to \"opt-in\" via its Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act contract or compact. The rule has flexibility that allows PRC programs to negotiate rates that are higher than the PRC rate based on Medicare methodology , but equal to or less than the rates accepted by the provider or supplier's most f avored customer rate; in the absence of Medicare payment methodology for a service, the IHS payment amount is calculated at 65 percent of billed charges from the provider or supplier. Medical Priorities - Recent PRC program increase in purchasing power through the PRC rates described above have allowed most of the IHS and Tribally -managed PRC programs to approve referrals in priority categories other than Medical Priority I (life or limb), including some preventive care services, thus increasing access to patient care services. In FY 2020, 93 percent of IHS-operated PRC programs were able to purchase services beyond Medical Priority II - Preventive Care Services. Prior funding increases and Medicaid expansion have enabled programs to purchase preventive care beyond emergency care services, such as mammograms or colonoscopies. The IHS PRC Workgroup helped IHS develop a more accurate form for annually reporting denied and deferred PRC services. In FY 2020, PRC programs denied and deferred an estimated $1,070,238,593 for an estimated 265,785 services for eligible AI/ANs. Because Tribally -managed programs are not required to report denials data, it is difficult to provide a verifiable and complete measure of the total unmet need for the entire I/T/U system. Therefore, the denied services estimate is based on actual data from federal programs and estimated Tribal data. CJ - 147 Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF) - In FY 2020 , all high cost cases submitted for reimbursement from the CHEF have been reimbursed. It is estimated that more cases may qualify for CHEF reimbursement but were not reported by local IHS and Tribally -managed PRC programs. Catastrophic case requests are reimbursed from the CHEF until funds are depleted. The implementation of PRC rates for inpatient and non-hospital providers of supplies and services as well as the increase of I/T/U beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid, Medicare and Private Insurance has enabled the CHEF to reimburse PRC programs for high cost catastrophic events and illnesses that occur through the end of the fiscal year. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non-Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be hospitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non -Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19.

Permanent ........................................................ Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 contracts and compacts, Tribal shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 authorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (IHCIF) for purposes of eliminating deficiencies in health status and resources of all Indian tribes, eliminating backlogs in health care services to Indians, meeting the health needs of Indians in an efficient and equitable manner, eliminating inequities in funding for both direct care and Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) programs, and augmenting health services where deficiencies are highest. The IHCIA specifies that the IHS take into account the actual cost of providing health care services given local geographic, climatic, rural, or other circumstances. The IHS received a total of $259 million in IHCIF resources from FY 2000 - FY 2018. Prio r to the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2018, which provided $72 million in a new IHCIF budget line, IHCIF increases were included in the Hospitals and Health Clinics budget line. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS A formula to allocate appropriations for the IHCIF was initially developed through the work of a Tribal/IHS Workgroup in 2000. The formula, which later became known as the Federal Disparity Index (FDI), or synonymously, the Level of Need Funded (LNF), measured the LNF for IHS and Tribal facilities relative to a benchmark level of funding. The formula was revisited once in 2010, prompted by the reauthorization of the IHCIA, which included an update to the IHCIF provision, expanding the list of services that the IHCIF may support, establishing a reporting requirement, and reaffirming that IHS must consider services and resources provided by Federal programs, private insurance, and programs of State and local governments. While technical improvements were made to the data used in the calculation, the IHS did not to ch ange the formula at that time. In late 2017, in recognition of the considerable changes in the health care environment since the 2010 Tribal consultation on the IHCIF, in response to Tribal requests, a nd the funding increase for the IHCIF in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, another IHCIF Tribal/IHS Workgroup (Workgroup) to the existing formula and make recommendations for improvement. CJ - 150 The IHS updated the funding distribution formula based on the recommendations of the IHCIF workgroup, and allocated an additional $72 million in IHCIF resources to 40 sites across eight IHS Areas that were at or below a 34.84 percent Level of Need Funded. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount* 2018 $72,280,000 2019 2022 President's Budget requests a total of $317 million for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund, an increase of +$245 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level.

Hepatitis B and Haemophilus Immunization Programs (Alaska) will support the provision of vaccines for preventable diseases, immunization consultation/ education, research, and liver disease treatment and management through direct patient care, surveillance, and education for Tribal facilities throughout Alaska. The Immunization Alaska Program budget supports these priorities through direct patient care, surveillan ce, and educating Alaska Native patients. These Preventive Health services contribute widely to the performance measures that fall under the auspices of Hospitals & Health Clinics. PHN clinical services directly contribute to community health and wellness through immunizations, case management, and patient education. CHRs are also community -based and contribute to follow up care and lay health education. Health Education activities permeate the Indian health system and are integral to the fulfillment CJ - 152of the performance screening measures. The Immunization Alaska Program plays a key role by tracking immunization rates through specific immunization registries throughout the State of Alaska, and such efforts contribute to the national immunization rates.

The PHN Program provides quality, culturally sensitive health promotion and disease prevention nursing care services through primary, secondary and tertiary prevention services to individuals, families, and community groups: Primary prevention interventions aim to prevent disease and include such services as health education/behavioral counseling for health promotion, risk reduction, and immunizations. Secondary prevention interventions detect and treat problems in their early stages. Examples include health screening of high -risk populations, screening for diabetes and hypertension, fall risk assessments, and school health assessments. Tertiary prevention interventions prevent or limit complications and disability in persons with an existing disease. The goal of tertiary prevention is to prevent the progression and complications associated with chronic and acute illness by providing optimal care for the patient. Examples include chronic disease case management, self -management education, medication management , and care coordination. The PHN program aligns with the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1 to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people by increasing access to quality health care services (Goal 1, objective 1.3). The PHN Program funds provide critical support for direct health care services in the community which improve Americans' access to health care and expand choices of care and service options (The HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022, Goal 1: Reform, Strengthen, and Modernize the Nation's Health Care System, objective 1.3) . PHNs support population-focused services to promote healthier communities through community based direct nursing services, community development, and health promotion and dis ease prevention activities. PHNs are licensed, professional nursing staff available to improve care transitions by providing patients with tools and support that promote knowledge and self-management of their condition as they CJ - 154transition from the hospital to home. The PHN expertise in communicable disease assessment, outreach, investigation, and, surveillance helps to manage and prevent the spread of communicable diseases. PHNs contribute to several agency's primary prevention efforts such as providing community immunization clinics, adm inistering immunizations to homebound AI/AN individuals, and through public health education, inspiring AI/AN people to engage in healthy lifestyles and ultimately live longer lives. PHNs conduct nurse home visiting services via referral for such activities as follows: Maternal and pediatric populations, including childhood obesity prevention through breastfeeding promotion, screening for early identification of developmental problems, and parenting education; Elder care services including safety and health maintenance care; Chronic disease care management; and Communicable disease investigation and treatment. PHNs perform a community assessment to identify high -risk populations and implement evidenced based interventions to address identified areas of need . This activity targets fragmentation in patient care services and improves care continuums, including patient safety . Interventions are monitored with data collection and evaluated for outcome with an emphasis on producing a good return on investm ents in terms of service(s) provided . PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS As part of the Agency's Public Health Response to the COVID -19 emergency, the PHN Program hosted the sharing of best practices, developed the agency's Recommendation for Home and Community Health Care Workers during COVID-19 Pandemic in March 2020, and shared tools and materials as they were developed to improve care response. As the COVID -19 pandemic spread, it became necessary to institute strategies to attempt to reduce transmission of the virus within AI/AN communities, the PHN Program encouraged compliance with CDC guidance(s) and recommended the creation of clear protocols which were communicated to staff and supervisors. For example, the implement ation of protocol to prioritize home visits to provide services to the greatest need, if resources become strained by use of local PHN Program Priority, Intensity and Timeliness of follow up policy and procedures. PHNs are engulfed in the COVID- 19 crisis by providing such services as contact investigation and surveillance of patients in the community. Several webinars have been hosted to share PHN specific electronic health record templates for COVID -19, case management via Icare to follow COVID 19 patient contacts for surveillance and supporting the agency's Contact Tracing Concept of Operations (CONOPs) which highlights the principles of establishing a contact tracing program. The Contact Tracing CONOPs aims to assist I/T/U communities to start organizing, developing, and/or refining their contact tracing capabilities in accordance with Federal, State, local, Tribal and other guidance. Towards the end of FY 2020, the PHNs prepared for a new phase against the pandemic, the implementation of the c oronavirus vaccine. Existing best practices such as collaborating with a team that includes a designated point of contact for each tribe, the Primary Care Physicians and utilization of an established PHN patient referral system; and, tribal programs for as sistance in monitoring patients was key in planning for vaccination administration. Hosting weekly calls with tribes to provide information and updates regarding plans for vaccination efforts, sharing of high risk elder list established prior to COVID pandemic, and planning to replicate prior PHN activity to high risk elders with influenza vaccines were used to define plans for administration of the COVID vaccine. Other established PHN avenues of services dictated plans for PHN COVID vaccination efforts su ch as home visitation for home bound elders and drive through influenza vaccines. Prior to COVID, PHN's were already visiting elders and others in the home for safety CJ - 155and medication assessments. When influenza vaccines arrived PHN's began re- visiting known high risk elders and high risk patients with the help of the community health representative (CHR). The home visitations included providing up to date COVID i nformation, safety COVID education, and planning for a home visit COVID vaccine once it became av ailable. The PHN Program aligns with the Agency's priorities and contributes to patient care coordinati on activities and access to quality, culturally competent care that aims to promote health and quality of life through a community population focused nurse visiting program which serves the patient and family in the home and in the community (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023, Goal 1, Objective 1. 3). The PHN Program assesses the services provided in meeting the agency's priority Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) measures and integrates the Department's Strategic Goal to protect the health of Americans where th ey live, learn, work, and play (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022, Goal 2, Objective 2.1, to empower people to make informed choices for healthier living) . Using a variety of methods to educate the AI/AN population such as via individual and group patient education sessions, screening activities and referring high- risk patients, and immunizing individuals to prevent illnesses , the PHN works to improve the ov erall wellness of Americans. Preventative health care informs populations, promotes healthy lifestyles and provides early treatment for illnesses. The PHN Data Mart report for FY 2020 reflects a total number of individual PHN patient related encounters was 391,738; PHN accomplishments in GPRA screening documented activities include the following encounter numbers : Tobacco Screening (2,921) Domestic Violence Screening (7,674) Depression Screening (8,530) Alcohol Screening ( 9,275) Adult Influenza Vaccines ( 47,766) In 2020, the PHN Program continued efforts to meet the IHS' s goal to decrease childhood obesity and prevent diabetes by supporting Baby Friendly re -designation by accomplishing the following activities: providing patient education, assessment and referral services for prenatal, postpartum and newborn clients during home visits , and utilizing a standardized PHN electronic health record template to document intervention (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2 to promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization, Objective 2.2: provide care to better meet the health care needs of AI/AN communities ). The PHN data mart provides a mechanism to evaluate how the PHN program delivers this evidence -based prevention service of promoting breastfeeding during the nurse patient encounter. For FY 2020, there were a total of 8,086 PHN patient encounters related to the Baby Friendly Hospital I nitiative . These patient encounters included 23,615 documented patient education topics provided by the PHN during prenatal, postpartum and newborn encounters, which included the following topics: breastfeeding, child health for the newborn, immunizations, family planning, sudden infant death syndrome, tobacco use/prevention, postpartum depression, formula feeding, and child health. As part of this initiative, IHS is encouraging clinicians in Indian Country to support policies and practices that foster breastfeeding as the exclusive feeding choice for infants during their first six months of life. By doing so, clinicians will reduce current and future medical problems and decrease health care costs. In 2019, the Clinton PHN Program, Clinton, OK, initiated a PHN best practice project to promote breastfeeding. The Clinton PHNs are addressing access to care by seeking lactation certification to support breastfeeding education services to patients in various settings including the home. They complet ed 90 hours of lactation management courses (60 hours of online education followed by 32 hours of classroom) to become International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs) specializing in breastfeeding management. They reached the goal to have all Clinton PHNs be IBCLC certified by October 2020. CJ - 156To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people by increasing access to quality health care services (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023 , Goal 1) , the PHN Program continues to support caregivers of individuals suffering from dementia. Caregivers supported by the PHN program includes screening for depression, the effect of depression on daily life, and caregiver burden and frustration. For FY 2020, there have been 4,381 PHN encounters to patients with dementia , and services provided at these PHN encounters include the following: Immunizations ( 1,187) Medications ( 412) Communicable disease prevention (499) Life adaptation ( 590) Safety and fall prevention ( 216) Tobacco use prevention (118) During the se visits , patient encounters documented by the PHN included the following : medication, hypertension, dementia, diabetes, long term drug therapy, opioid dependence, and counseling. The goal to continue to implement these service in Tribal communities in 2021 and future e fforts to adapt this intervention to deliver and sustain the program in AI/AN communities is ongoing. The Pine Ridge PHN Mental Health Case Management Program was established to focus on suicide prevention in the local community during 2016 to 2018; and , this program will begin again in 2020-2021 This intervention serves as a best practice for improved health outcomes of high risk patients through a community case management model that util ized the PHN as a case manager. The program billed for this service, leveraging revenue to support services in the community; served to supplement data collection reports on the PHN data mart to report outcome; and, in FY 2019 collaborated to establish similar services at the Standing Rock Service Unit PHN Program. During FY 2020, this activity was shared as a best practice resource for the PHN grant program for tribal and urban grant recipients (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.2). In support of the Million Hearts campaign to prevent heart attacks and strokes, PHNs provided 21,353 patient encounters in FY2020 that encompassed patient education on tobacco cessation at 3,166, hypertension at 18,785, and sodium reduction at 1,599. Additional education provided during these PHN encounters include tobacco use, immunizations, diabetes, and medications. PHNs provide services to enhance quality care and support patient safety during transitions of care settings by follow up on hospital discharges in an effort to decrease hospital readmissions. In FY 2020, PHNs documented patient encounters with patients who were discharged from the hospital and provided a total of 12,792 follow-up visits; some of these patients had multiple post discharge follow -up visits . Top patient education topics provided during these encounters include immunizations, community disease preven tion, lifestyle adaptation and medication. In FY 2019, the PHN Program aligned efforts to integrate Relationship Based Care (RBC) as a means of improving quality care and meeting the needs of the AI/AN population (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 2, Objective 2.2) . To build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships, RBC is linked to the 2019-2023 IHS Strategic Plan which is to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to the AI/AN people. Investing in a transformation of the program's culture will promote cost- savings with decreased cost burden of staff turnover and labor relations issues. Aggressive RBC training was put on hold due to the pandemic; however, to suppo rt staff retention and staff development, an evidenced based preceptorship program with proven training CJ - 157materials, preceptor development, and an evidenced based repository of training material w as initiated in 2020. In March 2020, the PHN Program hosted the Vermont Nurses in Partnership for a week long training in Albuquerque, New Mexico to establish evidence- based transition programs, competence validation, and experiential learning for the PHNs. In FY 2020 planning for ongoing trainin g to support this activity will continue . The PHN program continues to review the delivery of service for safe and quality standards of various accrediting bodies. This activity will focus on the Joint Commission to define the PHN services as an integrated IHS service for review and continued efforts to host webinars to share practices on safe and quality care with a focus on the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care survey. This activity will continue into FY 2021 to promote quality PHN services are provided in a safe manner. A s the primary care system is foundational to achieving high - quality, accessible, efficient health care for AI/AN clients, expanded PHN engagement will be made to support the patient -centered medical home (PCMH) efforts to enhance quality care. PHN programs will engage in FY 2019-2020 efforts to meet the IHS national target of one hundred percent of IHS ambulatory care facilities achieving PCMH by 2021. In 2019, the PHN program continued identification of interventions which target ed prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (ST D) to improve quality care. In collaboration with the IHS ST D Consultant (Office of the Public Health Service), this activity was monitored with the use of the PHN data mart tool as a performance measurement in support of practicing population based health management. The PHN data mart provides critical support in assessing improvement activities such as the provisio n of patient education, and the surveillance and treatment of ST Ds. Due to the pandemic, such planned activity as the PHN support of the Elimination of Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS in Indian Country Initiative was minimized ; however , the PHN data mart reports are available to monitor prevention, patient education and surveillance activities provided by PHNs. In FY 2017, the PHN grant program awarded 9 grants; these awards have a narrow and defined area of focus, seeking to improve specific behavioral health o utcomes and to support the efforts of AI/AN communities toward achieving excellence in holistic behavioral health treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention services for individuals and their families (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.2) . The purpose of this IHS PHN grant is to improve specific behavioral health outcomes through a case management model with the PHN as a case manager. In addition to reducing the cost of health care, case management has worth in terms of improving rehabilitation, improving quality of life, increasing client satisfaction and compliance by promoting client self- determination. The community based case management model addresses the PHN scope of practice of working with individuals and families in a popula tion-based practice to provide nursing care services in the community setting. Currently, there are 8 grant programs which are focusing on patient care services for behavioral health and coexisting conditions such as chronic disease management, maternal ch ild health care, and medication patient education services. A PHN Consultant was hired (March 2020) to oversee the PHN grant program particularly to provide technical assistance and share best practice for replication. In FY 2020, the program increased co ordination and collaboration with the local Behavioral Health Department to improve overall patient services. The FY 2019 target for the PHN Program measure was 381,314 encounters. The final FY 2020 result of 391,738 patient encounters exceeded the target by 10,424 encounters, a 3 percent increase. The PHN impact during the COVID- 19 pandemic is reflected in the top ten patient encounters addressing communicable disease and surveillance. Historically, d ata exporting processes have impacted the overall PHN performance outcome as several tribal programs have CJ - 158migrated away from the IHS Patient Management System (RPMS) resulting in less visits being exported to the agency's National Data Warehouse database ; however, in FY 2020 the pandemic crisis impacted the PHN workload with testing, patient monitoring and vaccine planning activities. The end result has been an increase in the number of PHN activities being reported in regards to services provided to address the COVID -19 crisis . In FY 2020, additional PH N data briefs are being created and posted on the PHN data mart to reflect the PHN activity in meeting several Agency goals ( specific to COVID -19 crisis) and to supplement the PHN program 's accomplishments report. These reports provide an avenue to monitor the PHN program's support of the health care delivery services in the community , and provides available data to inform I/T/U decision -making (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.3). In FY 2020, the updates to the PHN Documentation Manual was not completed due to heavy workload in responding to the pandemic. This will be a goal for FY 2021 and include in the manual PHN electronic health record templates and information on the PHN data mart reports to improve reporting of outcome. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be ho spitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non- Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID -19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID- 19 Response.

Self -Determination Contracts , Self -Governance Compacts, and Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service (IHS) Health Education Program has been in existence since 1955 to educate American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) patients, school age children and communities about their health. The program focus es on the importance of educating patients in a manner that empo wers them to make positive choices in their lifestyles and how they utilize health services. Accreditation requirements at IHS and tribal facilities specifically require the provision and documentation of patient education as evidence of the delivery of quality care. In FY 2020, there was a decline of 19.49 percent or 594,453 patient visits from the previous year . COVID -19 along with s taffing shortages significantly impacted provision of patient services, which was reflected in the decrease in documented patient education encounters for FY 2020. Data exporting process es have impacted the overall Health Education patient education encounters as several tribal programs have migrated away from the IHS Resource Patient Management System (RPMS), resulting in less encounters being exported to the agency's National Data Wareh ouse database. The end result of the migration has been a decrease in the number of Health Education patient education encounters being reported. The Health Education funds provide critical support for direct health care services focused on strengthening the collaborative partnerships among direct care pr oviders, patients, communities, and internal and external stakeholders. Funds are utilized to ensure IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health care programs have comprehensive, culturally appropriate services, available and accessible personnel, promotes excellence and quality through implemented quality improvement strategies, and strengthens the IHS program management and operations to address health disparities and raise the health status of AI/AN populations to the highest level possible. CJ - 162PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Health education is weaved throughout the Indian health system, as it is essential for all patients and disseminated among each discipline. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, health education materials were developed and disseminated, including patient education to mitigate risk of transmission, and shared best practices focused on prevention within the community. Critical patient contact occurred in clinical setting s and community f acilities to increase health knowledge, literacy, address myths, expand clinical outreach, and provide informal counseling, for patients. Both clinical and community- based services were tailored to meet the needs of the most rural communities. Using a health education/health communications approach the following materials were developed in partnership with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for American Indian Health (CAIH) aligning with the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts, Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Community Health Representatives (CHRs) program began in 1968 and was established to meet the following four goals: (1) greater involvement of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN ) people in their own health and in the identification and treatment of their health problems; (2) greater understand ing between AI/AN people and IHS staff; (3) improving cross- cultural communication between the AI/AN community and health service providers; and, (4) increas ing basic health care and instruction in AI/AN homes and communities . The CHR programs supports the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.1 and 2.2 to empower CHR patients to make informed choices for healthier living through the prevention, treatment, and control of communicable diseases and chronic conditions . Today, CHRs play a critical role i n care coordination and case management link ing the patient to the Indian health care system to prevent avoidable hospital readmissions and emergency department visits through home visits to patients with chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes , and hypertension. The aim of the CHR Program is to help AI/AN patients and communities achieve an optimal state of well -being by addressing health disparities related to chronic diseases providing health promotion and disease prevention, wellness and inj ury prevention education, translation and interpretation, transportation to medical appointments , and delivery of medical supplies and equipment within their tribal community. CHRs are the frontline workforce focusing on improving Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) for underserved populations to decrease health inequities across the country using a place- based approach. CHR activities impact SDoH with access to care and coverage, social/cultural cohesion, transportation, food access, environmental quality, social justice, housing and educational training opportunities. CHRs are trusted members of the community and serve as a link between the Indian h ealth system , including associ ated health programs , and AI/AN patients and communities. Importantly, this community based delivery of care is provided in coordination with tribal health departments and programs, thereby supporting IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, CJ - 167Objective to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people . PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS As CHR programs have transitioned from IHS direct care services to local community control via Tribal contracting and compacting, IHS's role has transitioned to providing support f or training CHRs and providing technical assistance to expand cohesion and greater understa nding of the full potential of CHRs to improve health, support individual and community development, and access to systems of care. In FY 20 20, CHR measures for all reporting categories exceeded targets in all (3) performance areas. Tribes who provided data reported 626,853 CHR patient contacts. This is an increase of 125,253 patient contacts above the target measure equating to a 25 percent increase. In addition, CHR reported patient contacts for visits made to patients with ch ronic diseases was 244,163. This is an increase of 42,763 patient contacts above the target measure for a 21 percent increase. IHS trained 376 CHRs through an online training platform on Basic CHR Series certificate and/or Advanced courses. This equates to an increase of 141 CHRs trained above the target measure for a 60 percent increase. Additionally, a total number of 9,762 completed courses were taken across all CHRs during FY 2020. Of the 376 CHRs, 56 completed the Basic CHR Series. Basic training provide s CHRs with general health education to build and support an integrated sustainable CHR workforce with the aim to promote health and prevent disease and disability in AI/AN communities. CHRs are required to successfully complete the CHR web -based modules within one year of employment. Advanced training increases CHRs health knowledge on a variety of public health related topics designed to improve outreach capacity to meet Tribal health system and IHS national goals. CHRs must have completed three years of continuous service as a CHR to be eligible to take the advanced modules. Specialized training expand s the CHRs knowledge base. Examples of specialized training include but are not limited to: Motivational Interviewing, Case Management, Maternal Child Health, Mental Health, Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, and CHR documentation training. With \"Protecting the Health of Americans Where They Live, Learn, Work and Play\" as one of the priorities identified in the Department of Health and Human Services 2019-2023 Strategic Plan, IHS offered training to CHRs across the nation in the Family Spirit curriculum, an evidence- based maternal child health home visiting program with the goal of assisting paraprofessionals in their ability to help young parents learn skills to address emotional and behavioral functioning including substance abuse prevention. In addition, this training includes curriculum materials with positive parenting techniques and health promotion material to strengthen families. The following is a summary of tasks for the Family Spirit Option Year 3 (2019 -2020) contract: 1. Transferring the in-person training to a virtual format to accommodate COVID-19 Pandemic. Nineteen total participants. 2. Providing technical assistance support on a quarterly basis for all three cohorts from 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. 3. Family Spirit affiliate summary data for FY 2020 reports: 40 sites submitted at least 1 quarterly affiliate report; sites reported in 2020 that 111 trained home visitors completed 7,025 home visits and supported 1,772 children from ages newborn to 3 years old. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CHR program shifted gears and aided with mobilization, including implementation of virtual home visiting to mitigate risk of transmissio n, conducted community surveillance, and tailored community- based programs and services within their communities. The quick pivot in service delivery provided critical patient contact, coordination with health care providers, and enhanced contract tracing. CHR programs have CJ - 168been highly engaged in COVID- 19 response efforts in spite of Tribal government shut -downs to all but essential services and challenges related to providing service while maintaining social distancing and personal protective protocols. In addition, to best position CHRs for COVID-19, the National CHR Program developed and submitted two guidance documents onto the IHS Quality Portal. ( Recommendation for Role and Response of Community Health Representatives/Community Health Workers during COVID-19 Pandemic . May 6, 2020; IHS COVID -19 Interim Guidance for Community Health Representatives/Community Health Workers Virtual Home Visits during the COVID -19 Pandemic . May 21, 2020). In particular, the role and response outlined four key areas CHRs impact Tribal Communities: (IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.1 Improve communication within the organization with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public ) Understand the disease and stay current with recommendations Communication Service coordination Empowerment A four-part series of educational webinars to build capacity of Tribal CHR /CHW program staff and improve health within tribal Communities was developed. The IHS National CHR program was able to impact 1,057 participants during the month of May. COVID -19 101: Information & Impact in Tribal Communities Home Visiting During Social Distancing CHR COVID -19 Best Practices Individual & Community Resiliency The CHR pro gram targeted the followin g activities in FY 2020 which aligns with the IHS Strategic Plan 2019 -2023, ( Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce. Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services) all e quipped CHRs to assist patients by increasing health knowledge and providing care to prevent avoidable hospital readmissions and emergency department visits. Additionally, the training allowed CHRs to be more effective in home visits, case finding and case management of patients with chronic health conditions. In February 2020, the IHS Division of Clinical and Community Services onboarded the Community Health Program Team Lead/Community Health Represen tative (CHR) Consultant.

( IHS Strategic P lan Goal 3, Objective 3.1 Improve communication within the organization with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public )) COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be ho spitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non- Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID -19.

Self-Governance Compact , Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Hepatitis B Program - The Hepatitis B Program was initiated in 1983 because of the need to prevent and monitor hepatitis B infections among a large population of Alaska Natives with or susceptible to the disease. It continues to provide this service in addition to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness and the medical management of persons with hepatitis and liver disease. Haemophilus Immunization (Hib) Program - The Hib Program started in 1989 with a targeted Haemophilus Influenzae type b prevention project in the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta and now focuses on maintaining high vaccine coverage in a continued effort to prevent communicable disease by providing resources, training, and coordination to Tribal facilities throughout Alaska. Alaska's geography necessitates innovation in p rogram delivery and use of technology as many Tribal facilities are located in remote areas off any continuous road system. The P rogram maintains immunization practice procedures in partnership with Alaska's statewide Community Health Aide Program to ensur e Health Aides working in both urban and remote Tribal facilities have the resources needed to provide high quality vaccination services where Alaska Native families live and play (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022, Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions ). Through strong collaboration with local Tribal health partners and regional immunization coordina tors, the State of Alaska Immunization Program and the IHS Area Immunization Program, the Hib Program offers clinical expertise in advancing vaccine reporting and data management capacity in an environment of evolving and expanding electronic health record systems (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.3 Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions ). In collaboration with statewide partners, the Hib Program advocates for continued access to afforda ble vaccine through public vaccine funding programs (HHS Strategic Plan 2018-2022, Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition ). The program works with Tribal public relations to CJ - 173 address pare ntal immunization hesitancy and highlight the importance of vaccines, utilizing locally developed culturally appropriate marketing materials and social media campaigns (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1 Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships ). In alignment with the President's Management Agenda priority of information technology modernization (PMA Goal 5.3), the Hib Program continues to focus on optimizing available information technology to advance capacity in maintaining high vaccine coverage rates, through refining electronic health record processes and expanding capacity for training, social marketing and consultation throughout Alaska statewide. The Hepatitis B Program and the Hib Program of the Alaska Native T ribal Health Consortium, in collaboration with Alaska Tribal Health Care System partners, provide s clinical expertise and consultation, trainings, research, evaluation and surveillance with the goal to reduce the occurrence of infectious disease and improv e access to healthcare in the Alaska Native population. The programs support immunization, patient screening, development of electronic health record reminders and systems, providing an infrastructure to maintain high vaccine coverage, and high clinical management coverage of hepatitis B and C in Alaska Natives. The program also manages patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and nonalcoholic fatty liver NAFLD that hav e nonalcoholic steatoh epatitis (NASH) we have recently begun periodic screening and will be including these in future outcome measures. The Program promotes semi -annual screening of chronic hepatitis patients for both liver cancer and liver function (enzym e testing). The p rogram s' activities support the IHS priorit ies on quality and partnerships as delineated in the IHS Strategic Plan . Working with partners within the Alaska Tribal Health System to meet IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 and the HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 the programs provide both direct and telehealth patient care and health provider education to not only increase access to quality care, but also expand the options available (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services, IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities , and HHS Strategic Plan 2018 -2022, Goal 1, Objectiv e 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options). Both programs are actively engaged in preventing and treating communicable and chronic diseases (HHS Strategic Plan 2018-2022, Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions ). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Immunization Alaska P rogram comprised of both the Hepatitis B and Hib Programs has several performance measures to monitor progress in achieving the goal of high vaccine coverage for Alaska Native people as described below . Hepatitis B Program The Hepatitis B program continues to prevent and monitor hepatitis B infection among a large population of Alaska Natives with or susceptible to the disease. The progra m evaluates hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination coverage of Alaska Natives, and the total number of Alaska Native patients targeted for screening and the total number of patients screened for hepatitis B and hepatitis C as well as other causes of liver disease that disproportionately affect the Alaska Native population. Due to the opioids crisis , new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections have increased 69 percent from 2015-2018 compared to the 2011-2014 time period. In response to this crisis, the Program is actively engaged in a statewide HCV elimination project. This involves recruiting CJ - 174 patients for treatment through our local outpatient clinic, field clinics and video clinics (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities) as well as performing provider in- person and webinar education seminars on treating hepatitis C to build capacity (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services) . The Program website (www.anthc.org/hep) provides online treatment documents and a treatment algorithm for Alaska Tribal healthcare providers. Also, Program staff conduct monthly A laska HCV E xtension for Community H ealthcare O utcomes (ECHO) collaboratives providing remote assistance for hepatitis C case review and treatment recommendations. Since 2014 , over 975 American Indian/Alaska Native persons have been treated for HCV through the Alaska Tribal Health System (HHS Strategic Plan 2018 -2022, Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions) . The Program has two non- invasive elastography devices allows for the safe, non- invasive monitoring of liver disease progression without having to perform an invasive liver biopsy. One is a portable machine that is transported to field clinics thus reducing the nee d for patients to travel to Anchorage or alternative site for their care (HHS Strategic Plan 2018-2022, Goal 1, Objective 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options) . With the onset of COVID -19 pandemic, the Program is monitoring persons with liver disease who test positive for COVID-19 to track their health outcomes and assess any complications related to their liver disease. In FY 2020: Hepatitis A vaccination coverage did not achieve the t arget, and hepatitis B vaccination coverage exceeded the target. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage was 86 percent (90 percent target) and hepatitis B vaccination coverage was 9 6 percent (90 percent target). Overall, at least 74 percent of AI/ANs with either chronic hepatitis B (6 8 percent screened ) or hepatitis C ( 78 percent screened ) infection were screened for liver cancer and for liver aminotransferase (enzyme) levels. Haemophilus Immunization (Hib) Program The Hib program continues to provide resources, training and coordination to Tribes in Alaska to maintain high vaccine coverage among Alaska Native people. Vaccine coverage data is collected for each Tribal region and measured in collaboration with regional Tribal health immunization coordinators (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization) . Technical consultation for the varying electronic health record (EHR) systems within each Tribal health organization is provided to support improved vaccine coverage for all Tribes. Statewide Alaska Native vaccine coverage rates (including influenza) are reported to IHS National Immunization Program for infants 3 -27 months, 19-35 months, adolescents, adults. Flu vaccine coverage rates for healthcare personnel working at Tribal facilities are also reported to IHS Nation al Immunization Program. Efforts pursuing information technology to advance capacity in maintaining high vaccine coverage rates include: participation as clinical experts on national EHR advisory workgroups regarding immunization -related product developmen t; local advocacy for implementation of clinical decision support system (vaccine forecaster) in electronic health record systems; and collaboration with the State of Alaska immunization program in expanding coverage reporting capacity in the state's Immun ization Information System (SIIS) (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018- 2022, Goal 5, Objective 5.3 Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals) . Improvement in vaccine CJ - 175 coverage relies on data capture and quality in electronic health record systems, facilitated by data interfaces, and in conjunction with clinical resources and training. During FY 2020: Immunization Coverage for Alaska Natives age 19-35 months was 7 3 percent, which approach es the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80 percent for child vaccine coverage with 4:3:1:3* :3:1:4 series (4 DTaP, 3 IPV, 1 MMR, 3 Hib, 3 Hep B, 1 Var, 4 PCV). Achieved 90 percent coverage with full series Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) vaccine in children age 19- 35 months, which is much higher than the US all- races 2018 rate of 74.6 percent . Achieved 60 percent Tdap vaccine coverage in all patients 19 years and older who had received Tdap within the past 10 years. Achieved 82 percent pneumococcal vaccine coverage in patients 65 years and older who received pneumococcal vaccine in the past ever. Assisted Tribal facilities using new e lectronic health record (EHR) systems or the IHS EHR immunization package in maintaining or establishing interface connection with the State of Alaska Immunization Information System (SIIS) to share vaccine records. o Provided consultation with four facilities that implement ed new EHRs on immunization documentation and facilitated SIIS interface implementation. Assisted IHS RPMS Immunization Advisory workgroup with gap analysis and provided associated consultation in preparation for IHS EHR transition to new clinical decision support system (vaccine forecaster). Collaborated with State of Alaska Immunization Program to i mprove capacity of Alaska SIIS in adult vaccine and flu vaccine coverage reporting; streamline processes for reporting 3 -27 months, 19-35 months and adolescent's vaccine coverage. o New adult vaccine coverage report expands reporting capacity for a number of Tribal facilities; data was utilized for adult Tdap and pneumococcal vaccine measures for this budget submission. o New flu vaccine coverage report expands tracking of flu vaccine coverage critical for the 2020-21 flu season during the COVID-19 pandemic. Assisted Tribal facilities in utilization of Alaska SIIS patient reminder system. Assisted Tribal facilities throughout Alaska to implement new State policy and procedures associated with vaccine electronic inventory management, delivery systems and documentation. Engaging in early planning for COVID-19 vaccine, including collaboration with Alaska's State and Tribal stakeholders and supporting identification of key participants is critical for strategizing and plan implementation.

Challenges include the diversity of EHRs employed by T ribal organizations that may result in temporary loss or delay of Area-wide reporting of vaccine coverage. Regular r eporting of immunization coverage is critical in assuring sufficient monitoring and follow -up with facilities experiencing vaccination administration issues. Technical assistance to sites will continue to be addressed through coordinated efforts by the Hib P rogram, IHS , State, and Tribes . Vaccine coverage is measured. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be ho spitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non- Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2022 budget submission for Alaska Immunization is $ 2 million, $47,000 above the FY 2021 En acted level . FY 20 22 Funding Increase of $47,000 includes: Current Services : +$47,000 for current services including: o Inflation +$9,000 to cover inflationary costs of providing immunization services in Alaska. CJ - 177 Population Growth +$38,000 - to fund the additional service needs arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. The FY 20 22 funding will provide coordination of vaccine coverage reporting for T ribal facilities, training of Tribal immunization coordinators, and clinic staff in vaccine recommendations and documentation, consultation in the migration to alternate EHRs, and regular notification to hepatitis patients of the need to complete liver function screenings so that program clinicians can identify serious liver disease or liver cancer when it is at an early and treatable stage. Hepatitis B Program - The program will conduct outpat ient clinics five days a week at the Alaska Native Medical Center, travel to regional health centers to conduct outpatient clinics , and will continue its web -based application for video -conferencing (Adobe Connect) that is accessible to the statewide Alaska Tribal Health System (ATHS) audience to provide relevant clinical information to assist in the care and management of hepatitis and liver d isease patients. Continue AK HCV ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) virtual field clinics where primary care physicians collaborate with program staff for the treatment of hepatitis C cases. Annual field clinics will be conducted across Alaska to provide direct patient care, clinical updates to ATHS staff, and to recruit and conduct follow -up on participants enrolled in the program's research studies. Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B vaccine coverage for Alaska Natives will be measured. In addition, the total number of Alaska Native patients targeted and screened will be measured for hepatitis B, hepa titis C , and other liver disease that affects Alaska Natives. Haemophilus Immunization (Hib) Program - The budget request will allo w staff to provide continued expertise and support to regional T ribal programs on- site and for many partner location s, including rural and isolated locations . Funding of these activities allows maintenance of current program support of Alaska Tribal immunization activities, statewide and national immunization advocacy and technical support, and Area reporting to IHS Headquarters. Activities include the maintenance of statewide Alaska Native vaccine coverage rate reporting to IHS Headquarters during current phase of evolving electronic health record systems. Expanding quality of services through provision of technical support for electronic clinical decision support systems (vaccine forecaster), coverage reporting and patient reminder systems. In addition, efficiency of consultations and trainings offered to Tribal facilities will improve through technology optimization such as utilization of widely available videoconferencing systems and local Distance Learning Network. Community outreach and patient education activities will continue to include limited print of media materials while also expanding to digital and elect ronic formats.

Permanent Allocation Method ...................... Formula Contracts and Competitive Formula Grants awarded to Urban Indian Organizations PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian H ealth S ervice (IHS) Office of Urban Indian Health Programs (O UIHP) was established in 1976 to make health care services more accessible to Urban American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. The IHS OUIHP 2017-2021 Strategic Plan guides, support s, and improve s access to high quality , culturally appropriate health c are services for Urban AI/AN people. The OUIHP Strategic Plan aligns with the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023 to support health care solutions that fit the diverse circumstances of Urban AI/AN people and the tribal communities they serve. Urban Indian Or ganization Leaders provided input through the Urban Confer process to help inform the development of the IHS Strategic Plan. The IHS Strategic Plan will guide the work of OUIHP as we continue to strengthen our partnership with Urban Indian Organizations ( UIOs ) to address the three overarching goals of the IHS Strategic P lan to improve access to care, quality of care, and IHS management and operat ions. The IHS enters into limited, competi tive contracts and grants with 41 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations to provide health care and referral services for U rban AI/AN people in 22 states and 11 IHS Areas . These IHS contracts and grants with UIOs address the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 by ensuring that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people . Awarding of these contracts and grants to UIOs also addresses HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, to protect the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play . UIO s define their scope of w ork and services based upon the service population, health status, and unmet needs of the U rban AI/AN community they serve. Each U rban Indian Organization is governed by a Board of Directors that must include at least 51 percent Urban AI/ANs . UIOs provide unique access to quality health care and culturally appropriate services for Urban AI/AN people. The 41 UIOs are an integral part of the Indian health care system and serve as resources to both tribal and Urban AI/AN communities. Urban AI/AN people are often invisible in the urban setting and face unique challenges when accessing health care. A large proportion of Urban AI/AN people live in or near poverty and face multiple barriers such as the lack of quality CJ - 180 and culturally relevant health care services in cities. UIOs are an important support to Urban AI/AN people seeking to maintain their tribal values and cultures and serve as a safety net for Urban AI/AN patients. Social determinants of health play a key role in health and wellness, and UIOs address a wide range of factors contributing to improved health outcomes. For example, Urban AI/AN people in need of substance use disorder treatment commonly exhibit co-occurring disorders, and UIOs integrat e behavioral health into primary care to offer health services within a culturally appropriate framework . In Calendar Year 2019, UIO s provided 729,888 health care visits for 76,760 Urban AI/AN people who do not have access to the resources offered through IHS or tribally operated health care facilities because they do not live on or near a reservation. UIOs vary in size and services - full ambulatory care, limited ambulatory care, outreach and referral, and residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment programs. UIOs are described as follows: o Full Ambulatory Care: Programs providing direct medical care to the population served for 40 or more hours per week. o Limited A mbulatory Care: Programs providing direct medical care to the population served for less than 40 hours per week. o Outreach and R eferral : Programs provid ing case management of behavioral health counseling and education services, health promotion/disease prevention education, and immunization counseling but no t direct medical care services. o Residential and Outpatient Substance Abuse Treatment : Programs providing residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment, recovery, and prevention services. Included in the above 41 UIOs funded through contracts and grants , are the following : o Oklahoma City Indian Clinic and Indian Health Care Resource Center of Tulsa: These two urban sites , initially demonstration projects , are now permanent programs within the IHS's direct care program and must continue to qualify as an Urban Indian Organization under the IHCIA definition , 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1660b. o Former National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Programs: As of FY 2020, the Urban Indian Health Program includes five UIOs that previously received grants originally awarded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (former- NIAAA program) and later administered by the IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP). OUIHP confirmed each of these former -NIAAA programs is an Urban Indian Organization as defined by the IHCIA and fully implemented the administrative transfer from ASAP to OUIHP, as authorized by IHCIA at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1660c - Urban NIAAA transferred programs. Congress approved the transfer of this funding from the ASAP budget to the Urban Indian Health budget line for FY 2020. These Urban Indian Organization contract a ward s address HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.3, to reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders through prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery support . The five UIOs provide high quality, culturally relevant prevention, early intervention, outpatient and residential substance abuse treatment services, and recovery support to meet the needs of Urban AI/AN communities they serve. The other major Urban Indian Health focus areas and activities are: o 4-in-1 Grant Program: In FY 2020, t he OUIHP awarded 4 -in-1 grants to 33 UIOs. The grantees are awarded for a three-year funding cycle from April 1, 2019 - March 31, 2022. These grants provide funding to UIOs to support four health program areas: health promotion and disease prevention services; immunization services; alcohol and substance abuse related CJ - 181 services; and mental health services. Grantees are required to participate in a national evaluation of the 4- in-1 grant program, which addresses IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 to promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization. The national evaluation includes reporting on the cultural interventions integrated into the 4- in-1 program activities, and practice based and evidence based approaches that are implemented to meet the needs of the Urban Indian service population. These grants expand safe, high quality health care options, and encourage innovation and competition, which meets HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2. o Urban Indian Education and Research Organization Cooperative Agreement: Provides national education and research services for UIO s and OUIHP through a cooperative agreement. The cooperative agreement include s five project areas: (1) public policy; (2) research and data; (3) training and technical assistance; (4) education, public relations, and marketing; and (5) payment system reform/monitoring regulations. This cooperative agreement meets IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2, to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships. o Albuquerque Indian Dental Clinic: P rovide s dental services through the Albuquerque Area IHS Dental Program. These services address the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 by ensuring that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people. The provision of dental services also addresses HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, to protect the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play. UIOs are evaluated in accordance with the IHCIA requirements . The program is administered by OUIHP at IHS Headquarters. OUIHP integrates Enterprise Risk Management by annually reviewing Urban Indian O rganization progress with set goals and objectives. The IHS Urban Indian Organization On -Site Review Manual is used by the IHS Areas to conduct annual onsite reviews of IHS funded UIOs to monitor compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulation contractual requirements established through legislation . The re sults are submitted to OUIHP for review and follow -up to ensure correctiv e action plans are successfully completed prior to continuation of funding. R equirements in the manual are based on best- practice standards for delivering safe and high quality health care and are similar to standards used by accrediting organizations. Many UIOs are seeking or maintaining accreditation from several accreditation organizations such as the Joint Commission, Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Healthcare (AAAHC) , Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, and National Committee for Quality Assurance. In F Y 2020, th rough an IHS contract with AAAHC, accreditation services were provided to 15 out of the 41 UIOs to meet IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.1, to create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization; and HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, to reform, strengthen, and modernize the Nation's health care system . PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS UIOs fulfill IHS data reporting requirements including the IHS Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) report and the Diabetes Non -Clinical Audit report. UIO s currently participate in the IHS Improving Patient Care (IPC) I nitiative and are now in the Quality and Innovation Learning Network (QILN) implementing what they have learned across a wider variety of clinical and administrative options. From October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2020, the Urban Indian Organization FY 2020 GPRA cycle accomplishments included: CJ - 182 87 percent of the UIOs reported on 26 of the 26 performance measures; 76 percent of the UIOs reported through the Integrated Data Collection System Data Mart (IDCS DM); 12 (35 percent) have GPRA data specific to their health program available i n IDCS DM; 9 UIOs reported through the Clinical Reporting System (7 of these programs reported both through IDCS DM and through CRS); and 4 UIOs reported manually using 100 percent review of appropriate data source (as opposed to sampling a smaller percentage of records). The IHS will proceed with plans to have all UIO s export data to the IHS NDW. This includes working with UIOs utilizing commercial off the shelf systems to export data to the NDW. The OUIHP will continue to work with the IHS National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) staff to improve the export and accuracy of data for UIOs. The OUIHP , with the assistance of the IHS Office of Information Technology, will continue to provide training and technical assistance to UIOs on accurate and uniform data collection, so as to achieve standardization throughout the system. This work aligns with IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 2.1.1, to improve the transparency and the quality of data collected regarding health care services and program outcomes. It also aligns with HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5, Objective 5.3, to optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals . Design requirements for the IHS' s IDCS DM, include an aggregate Urban report to provide the clinical measure results reported in the Outputs and Outcomes Table of the Urban program's budget narrative. IDCS DM data is only available at the service unit level and IHS is unable to view individual urban program data for some sites sending in data. An aggregate Urban report requires data from individual facility reports to produce national results. IHS will report data from aggregate Urban reports when available. FY 2020 COVID-19 accomplishments include: OUIHP conducted three urban confer sessions on March 25, April 1, and April 29 to seek input on Coronavirus (COVID-19) funding decisions for resource distributions to UIOs. There were a total of 551 participants (187 participants from March 25, 252 participants from April 1, and 112 participants from April 29). The Urban Confer Satisfaction survey results indicated that participants were satisfied with information shared and topics discussed from sessions. OUIHP distributed funding in the amount of $103 million to 41 UIOs from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act; Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act; and Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act for response and recovery to COVID -19. OUIHP approved Urban Emergency Funds totaling $200,000 to address costs incurred during the COVID- 19 crisis. The Indian Health Center of Santa Clara Valley received $172,205, Oklahoma City Area received $18,645, American Indian Health Service of Chicago received $4,150, and $5,000 was used to procure personal protective equipment for 41 UIOs. OUIHP coordinated two distributions of cloth masks totaling 78,500 to UIOs for critical infrastructure employees working in office settings to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, OUIHP received approval to utilize IHS Headquarters Managed COVID -19 funding for a cooperative agreement supplemental ($1 million per year for 2 years) to provide Public Health Support through education and services to 41 UIOs during the CJ - 183 pandemic. The supplemental w as awarded on December 12, 2020 to the National Council of Urban Indian Health. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs hav e infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be hospitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non- Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID -19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID -19 Response.

Authorizing Legislation ......................................................................... 25 U.S.C. 13, Snyder Act; 42 U.S.C. 2001, Transfer Act; Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), as amended 2010 FY 2022 Authorization .................................................................................................... Permanent Allocation Method ................................................................. Direct Federal , Grants and Contracts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) Public. Law 94-437, as amended, authorizes the Indian Health Service (IHS) Scholarship program, Loan Repayment program (LRP), health professions training related grants, and recruitment and retention activities. The IHS made its first scholarship program awards in 1978 when Congress appropriated funds for the Indian Health Professions (IHP) program. The IHP programs work synergistically and directly supports IHS' FY 2019 -2023 Strategic Plan, Goal 1, Objective 1.1 through the recruitment and retention of health care professionals to provide high- quality primary care and clinical preventive services to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The IHP programs also directly support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2 through critical support in continuing to strengthen collaborations between the IHS, Tribes/Tribal organizations, Urban Indian organizations (I/T/U) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to increase the number of sites eligible to participate as National Health Service Corps (NHSC) approved sites for the NHSC Scholarship program and LRP. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The IHP program has seen much success throughout the years including, but not limited to, the following: Recruiting well -qualified health care professionals through various sources: IHS Scholarship Recipients, Peace Corps, US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, U niformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), various social media networking sites and through Career Fair events conducted virtually due to the pandemic. Enhancement and update of the Career Opportunities webpages on the IHS.gov website. CJ - 188 Enabling AI/ANs to enter health care professions through a carefully designed system of preparatory, professional, and continuing educational assistance programs. Serving as a catalyst in developing AI/AN communities by providing educational opportunities for AI/ANs to become health care professionals and return to their local communities to provide health care. Developing and maintaining American Indian psychology career recruitment programs as a means o f encouraging AI/ANs to enter the mental health field. Assisting AI/AN health programs to recruit and retain qualified health professionals. Collaborating with the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program that received an additional funding for loan repayment awards to clinicians working at IHS facilities, Tribally -operated 638 health programs, and Urban Indian programs to combat the nation's opioid crisis. Consulting annually with IHS Area Directors, Tribal health directors, and Urban Indian health directors regarding their health professions priorities eligible for Scholarship and Loan Repayment Program funding. While the IHP programs have seen successes, IHP continues to strive to improve performance and identify areas of risk. Placement of new scholars within 90 days of completing their training continues to be a challenge. The use of online manuals, e- Newsletters, emails, and referral of graduates to recruiters have all been used to facilitate the 90 day scholar placement . In FY 2019, 42 percent of scholars had a hire letter within 90 days (target was 78 percent). Failure to meet this g oal was primarily due to scholars not completing their licensing boards and finding positions within the 90 day period. The Scholarship program continues to seek new ways to assist IHS scholars to meet this requirement. Assuring scholars and loan repayment recipients meet their service obligation is another critical component of the IHP programs. Annual employment verification through personnel rosters and certification by Tribal employers assist in this process. Scholarship program and LRP databases allow staff to identify when health professionals are expected to complete their service obligation and allow for timely follow-up. Loan Repayment Program (Section 108): The LRP is an invaluable tool for recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals by offering them the opportunity to reduce their student loan debts through service to Indian health programs with critical staffing needs. Applicants agre e to serve two years at an Indian health program in exchange for up to $20,000 per year in loan repayment funding and up to an additional $5,000 per year to offset tax liability. Loan repayment recipients can extend their initial two -year contract on an a nnual basis until their original approved educational loan debt is paid. In FY 2020, a total of 1,618 health professionals were receiving IHS loan repayment. This included 515 new two -year contracts, 538 one- year extension contracts and 565 health professionals starting the second year of their FY 2019 two-year contract. Applicants who apply for but do not receive funding, are identified as either \"matched unfunded\" or \"unmatched unfunded\" . The \"matched unfunded\" applicants are health professionals employed in an Indian health program. The \"unmatched unfunded\" applicants are health professionals that either decline a job offer because they did not receive loan repayment funding or those unable to find a suitable assignment meeting their personal or professional needs. In FY 2020, there were 381 \"matched unfunded\" applicants (including 94 nurses, 50 behavioral health providers, 9 dentists, 18 mid -level providers and 157 pharmacists, among others) and 133 \"unmatched unfunded\" health professionals (including 13 behavioral health providers, 9 dentists, 38 mid -level providers and 42 nurses among others). The inability to fund these 520 health professional applicants is a significant CJ - 189challenge for the recruitment efforts of the agency. A more detailed breakout of loan repayment awards in FY 2020 by discipline is included in a table at the end of the narrative. Scholarship Program (Sections 103 and 104) - Section 103 scholarships include the preparatory and pre- graduate scholarship pr ograms that prepare students for health professions training programs. Graduate students and junior- and senior- level undergraduate students are given priority for funding for programs under Section 103, unless the section specifies otherwise. Section 104 includes the Health Professions Scholarship program, which provides financial support consisting of tuition, fees and a monthly stipend for AI/AN students from federally recognized Tribes enrolled in health profession or allied health profession programs. Students accepting funding for programs under Section 104 incur a service obligation and payback requirement. In FY 2020, there were 681 new online scholarship applications submitted to the IHS Scholarship program. After evaluating the application for completeness and eligibility, a total of 266 of these new scholarship applications were considered eligible for funding. The IHS Scholarship program was able to fund 88 new awards. The IHS Scholarship program also reviewed applications from previously awarded scholars that were continuing their education. A total of 178 continuation awards were funded in FY 2020. A detailed breakout of scholarships awarded by discipline in FY 2020 is included in a table at the end of the narrative. Extern Program (Section 105) - Section 105 of the IHCIA, is designed to give IHS scholars and other health professions students the opportunity to gain clinical experience with IHS and Tribal health professionals in their chosen discipline. This program is open to IHS scholars and non- scholars. Students are employed up to 120 days annually, with most students working during the summer months. In FY 2019, the Extern Program funded a total of 34 student externs. A breakout of extern awards in FY 2019 by Area Offices is included in a table at the end of the narrative. In FY 2019, IHS implemented a new standard operating procedure that will actively recruit IHS Scholarship recipients into the Extern Program as well as offering Extern Program positions to non- Scholar healt h professional students. In FY 2020, the Extern Program was cancelled due to the pandemic situation.

Permanent Allocation Method ....................................................................... Discretionary competitive grants to Tribes and Tribal organizations PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Tribal Management Grant (TMG) program was authorized in 1975 under Sections 103(b)(2) and 103(e) of Public Law (P.L.) 93-638, Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), as amended. U nder the authority of the ISDEAA , the program was established to assist all federally recognized Indian Tribes and t ribally -sanctioned t ribal organizations (T/TO) to plan, prepare , or decide to assum e all or part of existing Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, functions, services, and activities (PFSA) and to further develop and enhance their health program management capability and capacity. ( IHS Strategic Goal 1, Objecti ve 1.1 : Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce and Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships .) The TMG program has provided discretionary competitive grants to T/TO , to establish goals and performance measures for current health programs, assess current management capacity to determine if new components are appropriate, analyze programs to determine if T/TO management is practicable, and develop and enhance infrastruc ture systems to manage or organize PFSA. The nature of the TMG program allow ed T/TO the option to enter or not enter into ISDEAA contracts/compact agreements which are equal expressions of self -determination. ( IHS Strategic Goal 3, Objective 3.1: Improve communication within the organization with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public.) The IHS established four funding priorities for the TMG program: Tribes that receive federal recognition or restoration w ithin the last five years with implementing or developing management and infrastructure systems for their organization T/TO that need to improve financial management systems to address audit material weaknesses Eligible Direct Service and Title I Federally recognized Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations submitting a competing continuation application or new application CJ - 194 Eligible Title V Self Governance Federally recognized Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations submitting a competing continuation or new application. The TMG program offer ed four project types with three different award amounts and project periods: (1) Planning - fund up to $50,000 with project periods not to exceed 12 months. A Planning Project allows establishment of goals and performance measures for current health programs or to design their health programs and management systems. (2) Evaluation - fund up to $50,000 with project periods not to exceed 12 months. An Evaluation Study Project determines the effectiveness and efficiency of a prog ram or if new components are needed to assist the T/TO to improve its health care delivery system. (3) Feasibility - fund up to $70,000 with project periods not to exceed 12 months. A F easibility study analyzes programs to determine if T/TO management is prac ticable . (4) Health Management Structure (HMS) grants are funded up to $300,000 with project periods not to exceed 36 months. HMS projects include the design and implementation of systems to manage PFSA, such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems or bil ling and accounting systems, management systems, health accreditation, as well as correction of audit material weaknesses. The IHS Tribal Management Grants program supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN by directly providing Tribes and Tribal organizations grant opportunities to develop systems, support financial management systems, and expand programs to increase access to prevent ive care services and quality health care.

Authorizing Legislation ......................................................................... 25 U.S.C. 13, Snyder Act; 42 U.S.C. 2001, Transfer Act; Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), as amended 2010 FY 2022 Authorization .................................................................................................... Permanent Allocation Self- Determination Contracts, Self-Governance Compacts , and Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Direct Operations budget supports the Indian Health Service (IHS) provi sion of Agency -wide leadership, oversight, and executive direction for the comprehensive public and personal health care provided to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Funds are used to promote the efficient and effective administ ration and oversight of national functions such as: human resources (HR) , financial management, acquisitions, internal control and risk management, health care and facilities planning, health information technology, Contract Disputes Act claims analysis, and other administrative support and systems accountability. These types of direct operations performed at the Headquarters and Area Office levels provide the foundation necessary to carry out the Agency m ission. The IHS Headquarters provides overall program direction, authorities, and oversight for the 12 IHS Areas and 170 Service Units; formulates policy and distributes resources; provides technical expertise to all components of the Indian health care system, which includes IHS direct, Tribally operated programs, and urban Indian organizations (I/T/U); maintains national statistics and public health surveillance; identifies trends; and projects future needs. The IHS Headquarters works in partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and sister agencies to formulate and implement national health care priorities, goals, and objectives for AI/ANs within the framework of its mission. The IHS Headquarters also works with HHS to formulate the annual budget and necessary legislative proposals, respond to congressi onal inquiries, and collaborate with other governmental entities to enhance and support health care services for AI/ANs. By delegation from the IHS Director, the 12 Area Offices distribute resources, carry out policies and internal controls, monitor and evaluate the full range of comprehensive healthcare and community-oriented public health programs, and provide technical support to local Service Units and I/T/U staff. They ensure the delivery of quality health care through the 170 Service Units and participate in the development and demonstration of alternative means and improvement CJ - 197techniques of health services management and delivery to promote the optimal provision of health services to Indian people throughout the Indian health system. Direct Operati ons funding supports all three goals of the IHS Strategic Plan. Recruitment, development, and retention of a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce (Goal 1, Access, Objective 1.1) is the foundation for improving quality (Goal 2) and strengthening management and operations (Goal 3). These funds are essential for sustaining a human resources program that can enhance and retain a workforce to carry out the agency's mission. The f unds also support quality improvement capabilities (Goal 2, Quality, Objective 2.1) to ensure a quality healthcare program that promotes accountability, integrity, and stewardship. Woven through all of these components are the concerted efforts to continu ally strengthen IHS program management and operations through improved communication (Goal 3, Objective 3.1), secure and effective management of IHS's assets and resources (Goal 3, Objective 3.2), and modernization of information technology and systems to support data driven decisions (Goal 3, Objective 3.3). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Direct Operations budget is critical for continued progress in assuring an accountable, quality, and high- performing Indian health system . Examples of significant agency activities made possible by Direct Operations funds are provided below. To establish long term goals for quality implementation and outcomes, the IHS developed a five- year (2019-2023) Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan was published in February 2019 after extensive gathering of stakeholder input. The IHS initiated Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer on the IHS Strategic Plan initial framework and formed an IHS Federal- Tribal Strategic Planning Workgr oup to review all comments and recommend a list of final goals and objectives for IHS leadership review and approval. The plan promotes a culture of accountability, quality, and patient safety across the agency , and serves as a roadmap for continual quality improvement. In December 2018, the Office of Quality (OQ) was formally established within the IHS Headquarters to continue elevation of and national coordination and oversight for quality across the IHS health care system. The focus of the OQ is to pro vide a structure to promote accountability and oversight through quality assurance to promote and sustain compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and accreditation organizations; quality improvement through innovation and implementation of quality improvement science; improve patient safety and reduce all cause harm; and enterprise risk management to ensure that high risk agency systems and processes are identified, monitored, and mitigated. Through the national leadership of the OQ in F Y 2019 and FY 2020, the IHS made significant strides in addressing priority areas for quality improvement including implementing credentialing and privileging software agency -wide; hiring an IHS credentialing program manager at headquarters; and awarding a new contract for an adverse events reporting and tracking system. The IHS is committed to making improvements and ultimately to being removed from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) High Risk list. Although the IHS is still on the list, significant progress has been made. The GAO cited 14 open recommendations in the High Risk Reports. Of those 14 recommendations cited in the High Risk Reports, GAO closed 12 recommendations. In August 2020, the IHS requested GAO to close another recommendation regarding Quality Care. CJ - 198Like other rural healthcare providers, the IHS historically has difficulties recruiting and retaining healthcare providers. To address these challenges, IHS continues to maximize the use of available recruitment and retention tools such as recruitment, retention, and relocation incentives; and use of Title 38 pay authorities. Most recently, t he IHS worked to convert podiatrist salaries to Title 38 to aid in the recruitment and retention of these critical healthcare providers. The IHS has also increased its competitive stance in the healthcare labor market through Title 38 Special Salary Rate (SSR) pay tables and developed a new table for licensed practical nurses and dental hygienists who serve in our hospitals and health centers. Additionally, pay rates have been increased in Title 38 SSRs for physician a ssistants and optometrists to ensure we are able to offer competitive salaries . To strengthen human resource management, t he IHS implemented the Security Manager System . This system supports the entire life cycle of IHS's personnel security and suitability processes, to include capturing and managing background investigations. Security Manager has a customized workflow that ensure s proper case management with a complete audit trail into the personnel security process. Use of this electronic system provides a simplified, streamlined, and standardized personnel security management process across the IHS. In FY 2019, the IHS continued to expand the use of data analysis and visualization tools to enhance reporting and data-driven decisions. Building on the successful completion of the IHS 3rd Party Revenue Dashboard \u2014a Qliksense based application developed to enhance reporting, trend analysis, and monitoring of third- party resources (e.g. Medicare and Medicaid) collected by federally -operated facilities \u2014the IHS completed the \"Follow the Money\" Dashboard. This dashboard allows non- technical users to review funding status and spending data related to Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) instantly. Both applications democratize data previously held only in the proprietary accounting and reporting system s, Unified Financial Management System and Financial Business Intelligence System. Users are able to access data in a non -technical format that can be quickly sort ed and compare d by parameters such as type, Area, Service Unit, month, and fiscal year. This capability eliminates delays in access ing data through production financial systems, provides more financial information more widely, and reduces the requirement for a skilled financial analyst to produce labor intensive report s on demand, thereby freeing valuable time for value added analysis. The IHS is committed to ensuring quality care for all patients and is actively working on deploying innovati ve strategies with a focus on achieving and sustaining improvements in quality of care, accountability and data -driven decision making, and recruiting and retaining a high performing workforce. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2018 $72,338 ,000 2019 $70,788 ,000 budget submission for Direct Operations is $108 million , which is the $ 25 million above the FY 2021 Enacted Level FY 2022 Funding of $108 million - Funding provides for the direct operations of IHS's system - wide administrative, management, and oversight priorities at the discretion of the IHS Director that include : Continuing vital investments to enhance the IHS' s capacity for providing comprehensive oversight and accountability in key administrative areas such as: human resources, property, acquisition, financial management, information technology, and program and personnel performance management. Improving responsiveness to external authorities such as Congress, the GAO, and the Office of Inspector General (OIG); and a ddressing Congressional oversight and reports issued by the GAO and the OIG to make improvements in management of IHS programs, such as the P RC program , quality oversight, and workforce. Addressing requirements for national initiatives associated with privacy requirements, facilities, and personnel security. Continuing analysis and settlement of tribal contracting and compacting Contract Support Costs (CSC) claims and maintaining policies and procedures to accurately determine CSC needs in the future. FY 2022 Funding Increase of $25 million includes: Current Services : +$3 million for current services including: o Pay Costs: +$ 3 million - to fund pay increases for Federal and Tribal employees. o Inflation +$156,000 - to fund inflationary costs. Direct Operations: +$23 million in additional Direct Operations funding is essential for sustaining and bolstering core capacity to promote the efficient and effective administration and oversight of national functions like financial management, human resources, grants management, acquisitions, ISDEAA contracting and compacting administration, con tract support costs and tribal lease payment administration, performance management, and other administrative supports and systems. These resources would support critical hiring and systems needs at the national level, and within the IHS Area Offices. Current funding and staffing levels have led to delays in reporting, contracting, grant making, and hiring, and may lead to increased program risk. Increasing resources for these core management functions is vital for shoring up foundational capacity to support the IHS mission. Additional staff and resources are needed to maintain national and Area- level focus on fiscally responsible, accountable, and effective adm inistration over inherently federal functions such as budget formulation and execution, policy management, workforce management and personnel security, acquisitions and grants management, Government Performance and Results Act and related performance manag ement, and other key functions. CJ - 200The IHS also faces increasing responsibilities associated with expansion of Indian Self- Determination, through which Tribal Health Programs operate over 60 percent of the IHS's appropriated resources. The IHS must have t he necessary resources to provide technical assistance to Tribes and Tribal Organizations, and effectively manage ISDEAA contracts and compacts. Investments in these critical programs can mitigate the potential for missed deadlines with potentially large and recurring financial penalties, facilitate consistency in ISDEAA contract and compact terms to reduce legal risk, and ensure well - prepared and accurate reporting and negotiations.

L. 111-148, title X, \u00a710221(a), Mar. 23, 2010, 124 Stat. 935); the Social Security Act sec. 1880 & 1911, 42 U.S.C 1395qq &1396j and the Economy Act (31 U.S.C 1535). PROGRAM DESCRIPTION In 1976, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorized the Indian Health Servic e (IHS) to collect Medicare and Medicaid (M&M) reimbursements for services provided in IHS facilities to patients with M&M eligibility. The IHCIA was later amended to allow IHS to collet Private Insurance (PI) reimbursements for services provided in IHS facilities for patients with PI. In 2010, the IHCIA was amended to authorize the IHS to be reimbursed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense for services provided through the IH S to beneficiaries eligible for services from either Department. In 2012, the IHS and the VA signed an agreement under which VA agreed to reimburse IHS for direct care services provided through the IHS to eligible American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) veterans. In fiscal year (FY) 2020, $1 billion was collected from third party insurers, of which $941million was IHS Federal M&M collections and $ 137 million was collected from private insurers. The FY 2022 estimates above are based on the FY 2020 actual collections. Public and private collections represent a significant portion of the IHS and Tribal health care delivery budgets. Some IHS health care facilities report that 60 percent or more of their yearly budget relies on revenue collected from third party payers. In order to fulfill the IHS Mission, IHS continues its efforts to improve the revenue generation process by following the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 Goals and Object ives. Collection efforts from all third party payers by IHS facilities supports IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services 1 Due to the effects of the COVID -19 pandemic, the FY 2020 actual collections of $1,084,410,000 was $109,567,000 below the FY 2020 estimated collections of $1,193,977,000. CJ - 207 are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska N ative people as well as Objective 1.3, Increase access to quality health care services. Accreditation - In accordance with IHCIA authorization for collections, the IHS places the highest priority on meeting accreditation and certification standards for its healthcare facilities. Third party revenue is essential to maintaining facility accreditation, certification and standard of health care through organizations such as The Joint Commission and the Accreditation Associatio n for Ambulatory Health Care. Third party collections are used to improve the delivery of andaccess to healthcare for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. This activity supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2: To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization . Feedback obtained from accreditation organizations during the review process is used by IHS facilities to support IHS Strategic Plan Objective 2.1, Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization. Monitoring - In addition to conference calls with IHS Areas, the IHS employs an online system to monitor the third party reimbursement process for IHS operated facilities. The Third Party Internal Controls Self -Assessment Tool provides necessary information for local managers and Headquarters staff to monitor compliance with applicable policies and procedures during the third party revenue collections process so they can take necessary actions and improve overall program activity. The IHS has also implemented Third Party Revenue Collections and Third Party Alternate Resource (health insurance coverage) Dashboards to monitor collections and insurance coverage at the National, Area, State and local level. Training of revenue cycle staff to use the dashboards effectively to identify areas for improvement began in FY 2018 and will continue in FY 2022. In FY 2022, IHS will f ocus on development and implementation of a standard site review/site assessment/site internal auditing template. Impact of COVID-19 - COVID -19 created unprecedented financial stress on the I/T/U health system. Due to the effects of the pandemic, the act ual FY 2020 collections of $1.1 billion were significantly less than the estimated collections of $1.2 billion. Pre -COVID- 19, I/T/U healthcare facilities always faced unique challenges to ensuring their budgets met the needs of the communities they serve. Aside from IHS appropriations, third party collections are the main source of funding to I/T/U health care facilities. I/T/U revenues have declined because of the COVID -19 pandemic which has impacted the utilization of health care services and availability of third party payers. Strict public health driven social-distancing measures, curfews, and stay at home orders intended to prevent the risk of further infection have led IHS patients and health care facilities to cancel elective surgeries, and non -essential medical, surgical and dental procedures. Many AI/AN patients have also had to postpone care. A s a result, overall face to face encounters decreased, and in addition some payers changed their payment methodology when visits were conducted via Telehe alth technology. In addition, rising unemployment has forced many people off of private insurance, a small but reliable part of the I/T/U revenue stream. These are some of the variables that contributed to the decrease in overall Third Party Revenue. T o more closely monitor revenue, IHS began a weekly Collection Monitoring Report/Analysis started in March, 2020 which has assisted in looking at the over all impacts of the Pandemic. The Provider Relief Fund authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, has provided support to I/T/U providers, which has allowed I/T/U healthcare facilities to keep operating, The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) also provided $2 billion in critical funding to offset the impact of lost reimbursements across the I/T/U. The IHS has also benefitted from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) COVID - 19 Uninsured Program Portal, allowing health care providers who have conducted COVID-19 testing or provided treatment for uninsured COVID -19 individuals on or after February 4, 2020 to submit claims for reimbursement. In addition, Ce nters for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) regulatory waivers and flexibilities have also been helpful, especially in terms of expanding access to telehealth. However, despite these efforts, these measures have been not enough to match the pre- COVID -19 reimbursement CJ - 208 levels. Post -FY 2020, IHS will focus on evaluating the total net impact of COVID-19 on our revenue system and make adjustments as necessary to return to a healthy revenue stream. In FY 2022, IHS will continue to strengthen its revenue generation policies and management practices, including internal controls, patient registration, patient benefits coordination, provider documentation training, certified procedural coding training, third party billing, electronic claims processing, accounts receivable, and debt management. Priority activities will include enhancement of third party billing and accounts receivable software to improve effectiveness and to ensure system integration with its business processes, compliance with Medicare and Medicaid , and industr y standards and changes in operational processes. Improvements for IHS operated facilities are coordinated with concurrent enhancements in Purchased Referred Care business practices related to alternate resources. IHS will continue to develop and implement various tools including reports to analyze a facility's service population and identify opportunities to increase revenue. These efforts support IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations, and specifically, Objective 3.2, Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources, as well as Objective 3.3, Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions. In addition, IHS continues to ensure compliance with statutory rules and regulations that impact third party collections directly and indirectly. Rules pertaining to the Medicare and Medicaid programs continue to have a direct impact on revenue generation. IHS reviews new policies and draft regulations prior to publication and provides feedback to CMS. After they are published IHS discusses the impacts with Tribal government representatives and urban programs. In addition, IHS has formed workgroups to maximize the positive impact for all IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health pr ogram facilities, such as the National Business Office Committee, which serves as a subcommittee to the National Council of Executive Officers. These efforts support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations, and Goal 3, Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen and sustain collaborative relationships. Partnerships - IHS continues to develop and enhance partnerships with federal and state agencies in support of IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships. Enrollment and collections depend, in large part, on IHS's successful partnerships and relationships, state participation in Medicaid expansion, and a wareness and willingness of IHS users to enroll in Medicaid and other programs. IHS continues to work with CMS and the state Medicaid agencies to identify patients who are eligible to enroll in M&M and the state Children's Health Insurance Programs. IHS also continues these partnerships in the implementation of provisions in the IHCIA, and the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. In FY2020 IHS senior leadership met directly with the National Association of State Medicaid Directors ( NAMD) to exchange information and educate NAMD on the Indian health system. In pursuit of better relationships with the states Medicaid programs, pursuant to CMS' Stat e Health Offic ial letter in January 2016 (SHO #16-002) IHS Areas have implemented care c oordination agreements between IHS facilities and non -IHS providers, including urban Indian health care organizations for the purpose of facilitating 100 percent reimbursement to the states by Medicaid for payments they make to IHS and tribal health care providers when they treat IHS -eligible and Medicaid enrolled American Indian and Alaska Natives. Some states have committed to dedicate any cost savings to increasing services and access to care for Indians. In addition, IHS anticipates that in -network contracting with health plans may work for many facilities and is working with CMS to identify ways to provide informational resources for implementation. Pursuant to health reform efforts, IHS is continuing to develop materials, presentations and stakeholder outreach for our federal, tribal and urban partners on what is needed to participate in the Medicare CJ - 209 Payment Reform/Quality Initiative efforts by CMS such as the Quality Payment Program (QPP). This includes data calls and working with Areas to determine IHS stakeholders that have reported or planning to report for future years. The IHS National QPP Working Group members collaborate with the Medicare and Medicaid Policy Committee (MMPC), the Tribal Technical Advisory Group (TTAG) and registry to support QPP efforts. Also, the IHS yearly reviews the Electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) and selects new measures for 2022 if needed. In addition, IHS collaborates with CMS and the Tribes on a number of matters, including implementation of and training regarding recent changes in legislation, eligibility policies, covered services policies, reimbursement policies and payment methodologies, claims p rocessing, denials, training and use of information technology resources at IHS and Tribal sites to increase the enrollment of M&M eligible AI/AN patients. IHS continues to coordinate outreach, education, and training efforts in collaboration with other federal, state and Tribal partners. IHS continues to partner with CMS to provide a number of training sessions nationwide for Tribal and IHS employees, focusing on outreach and improving access to M&M programs. During the PHE, guidance and training has be en provided online specifically updated in accordance with AMA and CMS rules, regulations, and waiver authorities. These training activities support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.1, Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce and Goal 3, Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources Recently, and in accordance with 2015 Certified Health Information Technology Standards, IHS launched a collaborative initiative to train staff in the collection of voluntary Sexual O rientation and Gender Identity (SO/GI) data in order to identify essential health services. Collecting this data in electronic health records is essential to providing high -quality, patient-centered care. An opportunity for Two-Spirit and LGBTQ people to share information about their SO/ GI in a welcoming and patient - centered environment opens the door to a more trusting patient-provider relationship and improved health outcomes for our patients. The training and collection of this data supports IHS Strategic Plan Objective 2.2: Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. In December 2012, IHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) signed the VA/IHS National Reimbursement Agreement that facilitates reimbursement by the VA to the IHS and Tribal facilities for direct health care services provided to eligible AI/AN veterans. In January 2017, IHS renewed its interagency agreement with the VA to facilitate the use of the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) Consolidated Mail Outpatient P harmacy (CMOP) System by the IHS. The intent of this agreement is to cost -effectively expand clinical and support capabilities of participating facilities through use of VHA CMOP resources and by combining participating facilities' prescription needs with VHA's. Improved efficiencies were gained through more efficient and effective use of staff, reduction in medication error costs, and reduction in medication error litigation. In June 2018, the IHS and VA signed an amendment to the agreement that extends the period of the reimbursement agreement through June 30, 2022. This was a significant step in continuing to ensure implementation of Section 405 of the IHCIA. The agreement represents a positive partnership to support improved coordination of care and non -duplication of resources between IHS federal facilities and the VA and it paved the way for agreements negotiated between VA and tribal health programs. IHS will continue to work directly with the VA to implement billing and reimbursement practices to ensure IHS receives proper payment for care provided at IHS and Tribal facilities to AI/AN veterans. Recent changes that were added through amendments to the agreement were identifying Telehealth as a direct service and allowing the billing/reimbursement for the COVID- 19 Vaccinations and Antibody Treatment. Monitoring, auditing, and compliance with the agreement will continue to be a focus for in FY 20 22. Current activities include but are not limited to exercising the additional Electronic Billing capabilities, working through system changes (VA) to ensure proper payment CJ - 210 proper denial, and assisting Tribes and IHS facilities in stabilizing their billing programs . These efforts focus on the IHS Strategic Plan Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships. Training - IHS provides continuous training to health care facility staff in areas related to various functions within the revenue cycle, including patient registration, benefits coordination, coding, third party billing, management of accounts receivable and other aspects of the revenue cycle. Programs are expected to ensure sufficient resources and training for staff to capture insurance in the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS ) system and bill accordingly. Area I/T/U staff are highly encouraged to participate in annual CMS trainings. IHS also hosts an annual Partnership Conference to provide the most current information related to finance, information technology, health information management, Purchased/Referred Care, and business office functions; special emphasis is also provided for the specific management needs of Tribes and urban programs. These training activities support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.1, Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce and Goal 3, Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources. Claims Processing Improvements - IHS continues to work to enhance each IHS- operated facility's capability to identify patients who have private insurance coverage and improve claims processing. The local service units utilize private insurance funds to improve services, purchase medical supplies and equipment, and to improve local service unit business management practices in support of maintaining accreditation. The IHS continues to make use of private contractors to pursue collections on outstanding claims from private payers. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS With the Memorandum of Understanding and amended Reimburs ement Agreement between the VA and IHS in place, IHS developed and executed an implementation plan to collect VA reimbursements at all IHS federal sites serving eligible Veterans. The VA has approximately 116 agreements with Tribal Health Programs in addit ion to the agreements at federal sites. In FY 2020 IHS implemented several amendments to the Reimbursement Agreement regarding telehealth, pharmacy and PRC - COVID -19 rel ated testing and treatment. This partnership with the V A and implementation of VA reimbursement at IHS sites serve to support the IHS Strategic Plan Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships, Goal 3, Objective 3.2, Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources and enables IHS to provide further services to local communities funded with these collections. The IHS HQ has also entered into cooperative agreements since 2010 with organizations such as the National Indian Health Board and the National Congress of American India ns to coordinate and conduct consumer centered outreach and education, training and technical assistance on a national scale for the 573 Federally -recognized AI/AN Tribes , and Tribal organizations on the changes and authorities of the new legislation for t he ACA and the IHCIA. The national organization partners have provided well over 100 training sessions and webinars for Tribes and tribal members, helped coordinate numerous enrollment events, created toolkits for youth and elders and offered technical assistance to AI/AN and non-AI/AN enrollment assisters. Through the IHS National Indian Health Outreach and Education (NIHOE) Initiative, the IHS continues to partner with national and regional Tribal/Indian organizations to educate consumers and tribal governments on the health care insurance options available, the process for enrollment, financial assistance, the exemption options for American Indians and Alaska Natives, eligibility determinations, the tribal employer mandate, and maximizing revenue. Durin g FY 2020 IHS partner ed under the NIHOE initiative to conduct several live outreach and enrollment trainings and during the COVID- 19 pandemic, pivoted to online webinars and training specific to operating during the pandemic. In addition, IHS CJ - 211 was able to work with the NIHOE partners to modify the existing work plans to include activities related to COVID -19 response messaging. The NIHOE activities support IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen and sustain collaborative relationships. In June 2019, the IHS Office of Resource Access and Partnerships hosted a joint Partnership Conference with nearly 1000 I/T/U attendees from the Business Office, OIT, Health Information Management, Purchased/Referred Care, Finance, and other components of the Revenue Cycle. The conference convened a series of training sessions showcasing advances and improvements of these mission -critical functions. The Business Office sessions focused on increasing efficiencies in the revenue cycle, business practices and productivity, and using reports to identi fy gaps in the revenue cycle. The Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) sessions included updates to the PRC Chapter of the Indian Health Manual , developments in automating Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund functions, and PRC referral best practices. The Health Information Management (HIM) sessions provide information and best practices on coding and auditing, the electronic health record, operational processes, privacy, and records management. Sessions were also available on leadership training, stress managem ent, quality improvement, and wellness activities. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the July, 2020 partnership was postponed until July of 2021. As an interim solution, at the end of September and early October 2020, IHS partnered with CMS to offer 14 separ ate webinars on topics typically addressed during the annual Partnership conference. IHS was able to partner with CMS to arrange to offer several webinars on topics typically addressed during the annual conference. The IHS HQ provided Area Revenue Cycle training in FY 2017, FY 2018, FY 2019, FY 2020 to IHS revenue staff across the Agency. This training was also available to Tribal and urban program staff. Over 500 attendees have participated in the training, which covered aspects of the entire revenue cycle. This training focused on Third Party Billing and Accounts Management, and the Resource Patient Management System (RPMS) Process. In addition, IHS hosted an Accounts Reconciliation Workshop in FY 2019, which included finance and business office staff from every IHS Area. In FY 2020, several similar trainings were held, and additional ones scheduled but were postponed due to the COVID -19 pandemic. In FY 2019, the IHS revised and updated the Revenue Operations Manual (ROM). The ROM provides a system -wide reference resource available to all I/T/U facilities across the United States, to assist staff with all functions related to business operation procedures and processes. IHS developed training materials for the revised ROM and conducted webinars in FY 2021 to provide an overview of the revised ROM 2.0. IHS continued its strong partnership with Treasury Fiscal Services to further protect, control, and monitor all third party collections. Treasury mandates require that all Federal Agencies move towards an electronic environment for funds transfers and accountability of funds. In 2019, IHS, in Partnership with Treasury Fiscal Services, PNC Bank (Fiscal Agent) and other Financial Institution began laying the gro undwork for converting all paper checks received by the Agency to be settled in a more secure and timely manner. In FY 2020 IHS continued to work towards a complete electronic patient account environment, and actually is surpassed industry standards in this arena. IHS has converted all Federal locations receiving paper check reimbursement (through PNC Lockboxes) to the ECP (Electronic Check Processing) system. This was completed in August, 2020. IHS has met and exceeded Treasury standards in this Conver sion. In FY 2019 IHS drafted a Pharmacy Benefits Manager Contract Review Process in order to more efficiently review, respond, negotiate, and track contract offers, modifications, and amendments. In FY 2021, the process will be fully implemented. CJ - 212 Finally, in FY 2021 IHS will update the Third Party Internal Controls Self-Assessment Tool questions and collaborate internally on the update of the IHS Debt Management Policy.

Authorizing Legislation ......................................................................... 25 U.S.C. 13, Snyder Act; 42 U.S.C. 2001, Transfer Act; Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), as amended 2010 FY 2022 Authorization .................................................................................................... Permanent Allocation .................................................................................................... 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Maintenance and Improvement (M&I) funds are the primary source of funding to maintain, repair, and improve existing Indian Health Service ( IHS) and Tribal health care facilities, which are used to deliver and support health care services. M&I funding supports federal, government-owned buildings and tribally- owned space where health care services are provided pursuant to contracts or compacts executed under the provisions of the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (P.L. 93-638). M&I funds are necessary to achieve and maintain accreditation, to meet building codes and standards, to maintain and repair the physical condition of health care facilities, to modernize existing health care facilities to meet changing health care delivery needs, and to implement mandated requirements (e.g., energy conservation, seismic, environmental, handicapped accessibility, security, etc.). Efficient and effective buildings and infrastructure are vital to delivering health care in direct support of the IHS mission and priorities. Maintaining reliable and efficient buildings is an increasing challenge as existing health care facilities age and additional space is added into the real property inventory. The average age for IHS-owned health care facilities is approximately 37 years, whereas the average age, including recapitalization of private- sector hospital plants, is 9 to 10 years. 1 Many IHS and Tribal health care facilities are operating at or beyond capacity, and their designs are not efficient in the co ntext of modern health care delivery. In addition, as existing health care facilities continue to age, the operational and maint enance costs increase. IHS hospital administrators have reported that old or inadequate physical environments challenged their ability to provide quality care and maintain compliance with the Medicare Hospital Conditions of Participation. Further, the administrators reported that maintaining aging buildings and equipment is a major challenge. Over one third of all IHS hospital deficiencies have 1 The 'average age of hospital plant' measures the average age of the facility including capital improvements, replacement of b uilt-in equipment and modernization. CJ - 217been found to be related to facilities with some failing on infection control criteria and others having malfunctioning exit doors. The physical condition of IHS-owned and many tribally -owned healthcare facilities is evaluated through routine observations by facilities personnel and by in-depth condition surveys. These observations and surveys identify facility, fire- life-safety, and program deficiencies, and are used to develop IHS' estimate of the Backlog of Essential Maintenance, Alteration, and Repair (BEMAR). The BEMAR is a measure of the condition of health care facilities in the Indian health system and establishes priorities for larger M&I projects. T he BEMAR fo r all IHS and reporting Tribal health care facilities as of October 1, 2020, is $944.9 million. When IHS replaces an older, obsolete hospital or clinic with a new facility, all deficiencies associated with the old facility are removed from the backlog. The Facilities Management Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023, Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people; Objective 1.1: Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, and Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services. Additionally, Facilities Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 3: To streng then IHS program management and operations; Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources. M&I Funds Allocation Method The IHS M&I funds are allocated in four categories: routine maintenance, M&I projects, environmental compliance , and demolition: 1. Routine Maintenance Funds - These funds support activities that are generally classified as those needed for maintenance and minor repair to keep the health care facility in its current condition. Funding allocation is formula based. T he Building Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences has determined that approximately two to four percent of current replacement value of supported buildings is required to maintain (i.e., 'sustain') facilities in their current condition. 2 2. M&I Project Funds - These funds are used for major projects to reduce the BEMAR and make improvements necessary to support health care delivery. Funding allocation is formula based. 3. Environmental Compliance Funds - These funds are used to address findings an d recommendations from environmental audits, to improve energy efficiency and water efficiency, to increase renewable energy usage, to reduce consumption of fossil -fuel generated electricity, and to implement other sustainability initiatives. These funds are available to Federal and Tribal health care facilities on a national basis. 4. Demolition Funds - The IHS has a number of Federally-owned buildings that are vacant, excess, or obsolete. Demolition funds are used to dispose of these excess assets. These funds may be augmented with Environmental Compliance Funds as available for demolition and disposal to the extent that the proposed action reduces hazards, environmental concerns, or liability to IHS. Based upon recent interpretation of the Administ rative 2 Committing to the Cost of Ownership - Maintenance and Repair of Public Buildings, The National Academies Press (1990), available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog . CJ - 218Provision related to Demolition of hazardous, obsolete federal buildings, the inventory of this federal inventory continues to grow as does the potential liability. IHS Strategic Plan and how the Facilities programs are implementing : In consultation with Tribes and the Federal healthcare sites, IHS is allocating funding to the IHS Area Offices to complete BEMAR projects t o make renovations and improvements necessary to support health care delivery in the health care facilities and to modernize the health care facilities and staff quarters to expand access to quality health care services. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2018 $167,527,000 2019 $167,527 ,000 2020 $168,952 ,000 2021 Enacted $168,952 ,000 2022 President's Budget $222,924 ,000 TRIBAL SHARES There are no Tribal Shares allocated fro m Maintenance & Improvement funds. Rather, Tribal shares associated with the Facilities Program may be transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities at a Federal or Tribal healthcare site. Tribes may also contract or compact to perform individual Maintenance & Improvement projects that are awarded to federally owned sites. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2022 budget submission for Maintenance and Improvement is $ 223 m illion , which is +$54 million above the FY 2021 Enacted Level. FY 2022 Funding Increase of +$ 54 million includes: Current Services : +$4 million for current services including: Inflation : +$931,000 - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. Population Growth +$3 million - to address the impact of the additional services need arising from the growing AI/ AN. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. Maintenance and Improvement: +$50 million to support additional routine maintenance and repair, BEMAR, environmental compliance, and demolition projects across Indian Country. The total $223 million funding request for FY 2022 would support: Approximately $105 million is the projected amount for routine maintenance and repair to sustain the condition of federal and Tribal healthcare facilities buildings. These funds will support facilities activities that are generally classified as those needed for 'sustainment' of existing facilities and provided to the IHS Area Offices and to Tribe s for daily maintenance CJ - 219activities and local projects to maintain the current state of health care facilities. These Routine Maintenance Funds may be used for Area and Tribal M&I projects to fund smaller elements of the backlog of work to address the old and antiquated facilities plant infras tructure (e.g., mechanical and electrical BEMAR) and program enhancements. Approximately $115 million would be available for major Area and Tribal M&I projects to reduce the BEMAR deficiencies and to improve healthcare facilities to meet changing healthcare delivery needs. The FY 2022 Budget Request continues funding critical projects to address the old and antiquated facilities plant infrastructure (e.g., mechanical and electrical BEMAR) , accreditation standards, and program enhancements , all of which is essential to support health delivery . Approximately $3 million would be available for environmental compliance projects. The IHS places a high priority on meeting Federal, State, and local legal/regulatory environmental requirements, including allocating funding to address findings and recommendations from environmental audits. The IHS has currently identified approximately $8 million in environmental compliance tasks and included them in the BEMAR database. M&I funds, a portion from above categories retained by Headquarters, also provide resources for the demolition of IHS facilities that are no longer needed. The IHS has approximately 120 Federally -owned buildings that are vacant, excess, or obsolete. Many of these buildings are safety and security hazards. IHS plans for orderly demolition of some of these buildings, in concert with transferring others, reducing hazards and liability. Demolition Funds may be used in concert with environmental compliance funds as available for demolition of the Federal buildings to the extent that the proposed action reduces hazards, environmental concerns, or liability to the Indian Health Service. Since F Y 2000 when funds were first set aside for the demolition of Federal buildings, associated demolition costs have risen significantly due to inflation, environmental regulations, recycling and landfill diversion requirements, abatement of hazardous material, etc. For example, many IHS locations are very remote which significantly increases the cost to haul the demolition waste off the reservation to approved landfills and recycling facilities. OUTPUT S / OUTCOME S The Outcomes for this program are measured through BEMAR, i.e., progress in addressing maintenance needs and facility deficiencies. Maintaining effective and efficient healthcare buildings improve the ease and access to care, facilitate successful behavioral health services, and enable the hiring and retention of healthcare professionals by giving them modern space and equipment to deliver services. IHS targets the M&I funding, and supplements these funds with collections where available, towards major projects to reduce the BEMAR and improve the condition of existing Federal and Tribal healthcare sites. A few e xample s of these projects include: renovating/expanding pharmac y space , improvements to dental cl inics to serve more users, remodel ing reception/waiting areas, construction of CT suite and new digital radiology rooms , repaving parking lots, emergency department renovations, new heating- ventilation -air conditions systems, sustainability projects to reduce utility costs, etc. Continued investment in the BEMAR which is currently at $945 million , will enable IHS and the Tribe s to maintain accreditation standards and delivery quality health care services.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Care Improve ment Act (IHCIA) requires the Indian Health Service ( IHS) to identify the universe of sanitation facilities needs for existing American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) homes by documenting deficie ncies and pro posing projects to address their needs. These projects prevent communicable diseases by pr oviding new and existing homes with s ervices such as water wells, onsite wastewater disposal systems, or connections to community water supply and wastewater disposal systems. These projects can also include provision of new or upgraded water supply or waste disposal systems. These outcomes support both the HHS and IHS Strategic Plans . (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 - 2022, Objective 2.2: \" Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions \" and IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services. Strategy 14, \" Develop and coordinate environmental engineering, environmental health, and health facilities engineering services to provide effective and efficient public health services... \"). The four types of sanitation facilities projects funded through IHS are: (1) projects to serve existing housing; (2) projects to serve new or like-new housing, such as Indian homes being constructed or rehabilitated by the Bureau of Indian A ffairs (BIA) -Home Improvement Program, Tribe s, individual homeowners, or other nonprofit organizations; (3) special projects (studies, training or other needs related to sanitation facilities construction); and (4) emergency projects. Projects that serve new or like-new housing are funded based on a priority classification system. Projects that provide sanitation facilities to existing homes are selected for funding in priority order each year from the Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS). The SDS is an in ventory of the sanitation deficiencies of federal ly recognized AI/AN eligible homes and communities; th e sanitation deficiencies include needed water, sewer, and solid waste facilities for existing AI/AN homes. These actions support Strategy 1, \" Improve the transparency and quality of data collected regarding health care service and program outcomes \" (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Objective 2.1: Create CJ - 222quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization ). Project selection is driven by objective evaluation criteria including health impact, existing deficiency level, adequacy of previous service, capital cost, local Tribal priority, operations and maintenance capacity of the receiving entity, availability of contributions from non-IHS sourc es, and other conditions that are locally determined. The SDS priority position of each unfunded project is reevaluated with the Tribe s in each Area annually. Sanitation Facilities Construction (S FC) projects can be managed by IHS directly or by Tribe s that elect to use the Title I or Title V authorization under P.L. 93-638, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Sanitation facilities projects are carried out cooperat ively with the Tribe s that will be served, and construction is performed by either the IHS or the Tribe s (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships ). Projects start with a Tribal project proposal and are funded and implemented through execution of an agreement between a Tribe and IHS. In t hese agreements, the Tribe s also assume ownership responsibilities, including operation and maintenance. The overall SFC goals, reporting requirements, eligibility criteria, project planning, and funding priorities remain the same, regardless of the delivery methods chosen by a Tribe . The SFC Program leverages its capabilities in partnering with Tribes by also partnering with other Federal agencies in co nstructing or financing construction of water supply, wastewater and solid waste disposal projects addressing sanitation deficiencies faced by Tribes. One way in which the SFC Program engages in such partnerships is through the Infrastructure Task Force (ITF), a partnership of Federal agencies focused on finding ways to better serve Tribes through cooperative efforts (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships ). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The SFC Program is an integral component of IHS disease prevention activities. IHS has carried out the program since 1959 using funds appropriated to provide water and waste disposal facilities for eligible AI/AN homes and communities. As a result, infan t mortality rates and mortality rate s for gastroenteritis and other environmentally -related diseases have declined. Research supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states populations in regions with a lower proportion of homes with w ater service, reflect significantly higher hospitalization rates for pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus . 1 Researchers associate d the increasing illnesses with the restricted access to clean water for hand washing and hygiene. The SFC Program works collaboratively with Tribe s to assure all AI/AN homes and communities are provided with safe and adequate water supply and waste disposal facilities as soon as possible. In FY 2020, IHS funded projects to provide service to 37,771 AI/AN homes . IHS also completed construction on 260 projects with an average project duration of 3.9 years. However, at the end of FY 2020 about 7,140, or 1.8 percent of all AI/AN homes tracked by IHS lacked water supply or wastewater disposal facilities ; and, about 112,082 or approximately 28 percent of AI/AN homes tracked by IHS were in need of some form of sanitation facilities improvements. The individuals who live in homes without adequate sanitation facilities are at a higher risk for gastrointestinal disease, 1 Thomas W. Hennessy, Troy Ritter, Robert C. Holman, Dana L. Bruden, Krista L. Yorita, Lisa Bulkow, James E. Cheek, Rosalyn J. Singleton, and Jeff Smith. The Relationship Between In-Home Water Service and the Risk of Respiratory Tract, Skin, and Gastrointestinal Tract Infections Among Rural Alaska Natives. American Journal of Public Health: November 2008, Vol. 98, No. 11, pp. 2072 -2078. CJ - 223respiratory disease and other chronic diseases.2 Many of these homes without service are very remote and may have limited access to health care which increases the importance of improving environmental conditions. The total sanitation facili ty need reported through SDS has increased approximately $0.52 billion or 20.2 percent from $ 2.57 billion to $3.09 billion from FY 2019 to FY 20 20. In FY 2020, the Indian Health Service was appropriated $ 0.20 billion to address sanitation deficiencies and support provision of sanitation facilities to eligible AI/AN homes and communities. The magnitude of the sanitation facility needs increase is due to the IHS implementing a revised prioritization system to indicate the level of project planning. A \"tier \" system was introduced with the publication of the 2019 SDS Guidelines document. Projects considered \"ready to fund\" are assigned tier 1, while projects considered \"engineering assessed\" are assigned tier 2. Projects considered tier 3 are those that are only \"preliminarily assessed\"; previously many of these projects were not reported to Congress. In FY 2020, there was a total of $0.67 billion in tier 3 projects, resulting in an increase in the total sanitation facility need reported through SDS. During FY 2020, 373 construction projects to address water supply and wastewater disposal needs were funded with a construction cost of $220 million using IHS and contributed funds. Once constructed, these sanitation facilities will benefit an estimated 143,0 00 AI/AN people and help avoid over 235,000 inpatient and outpatient visits related to respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and gastro enteric disease over 30 years. The health care cost savings for these visits alone is estimated to be over $259 million . Every $1 spent on water and sewer infrastructure will save $1.18 in avoided direct healthcare cost. These outcomes support Strategy 14, \"Develop and coordinate environmental engineering, environmental health, and health facilities engineering services to p rovide effective and efficient public health services...\". (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services). In FY 2022, t he SFC Program will continue to focus on improving quality of data reported through the SDS on the sanitation facility needs supporting AI/AN homes and communities (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization ). These efforts will ensure the sanitation facilities needs included in SDS are: Adequately documented; Reflect an update of current needs ; and Include only sanitation facilities fun dable by the SFC program for AI/AN eligible homes and communities and consistent with the prescribed Deficiency Levels referenced in the IHCIA . Additionally, in FY 2022, the SFC Program will continue to focus on maintaining average construction project duration to 4.0 years. In order to achieve this outcome, funds will only be obligated to projects that have been certified by the SFC Program Areas as \"ready to fund\" ; this means they have a well- defined scope, a detailed cost estimate, a completed preliminary design and that known potential risks to project construction, operation and maintenance have been considered and mitigated. 2Thomas W.

The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. Sanitation Facilities Construction Increase: +$150.0 million - The disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on Indian Country highlighted the critical need for potable water, water treatment systems, and solid waste systems in American Indian and Alaska Native communities. These additional resources will address the backlog in unfunded sanitation facil ities construction projects reported annually to the Congress. The IHS expects that the additional resources would support potable water and sanitation improvements for approximately 38,184 eligible American Indian and Alaska Native homes. The total of $351 million funding request for FY 2022 would support: Approximately $267 million would support prioritized projects to serve existing homes, based on a formula that considers, among other factors, the cost of facilities to serve existing homes that: (a) have not received sanitation facilities for the first time, or (b) are served by sanitation facilities that are in need of some form of improvement. Another element of the distribution formula is a weight factor that favors Areas with larger numbers of AI/AN homes without water supply or sewer facilities, or without both. Approximately $80 million would serve new and like- new homes, which are non-Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) homes. HUD homes are served under HUD authorities and appropriations. The IHS appropriated funds for sanitation facilities construction are prohibited by law from being used to provide sanitation facilities for new homes funded with grants by the housing programs of HUD. These HUD housing grant programs for new homes should continue to incorporate funding for the sanitation facilities necessary for those homes. A portion of these funds may also be used for sanitation facilities for individual homes of the disabled or sick, with a physician referral, indicating an immediate medical need for adequate CJ - 225sanitation facilities in their home. 3 Priority will be given to projects under the BIA Housing Improvement Program (HIP) to serve new and like-new homes with the exception of \"Category A\" BIA HIP homes, which are considered existing homes and will be served with the funds described in the first bullet of this section. In addition, up to $5 million may be used for projects to clean up open dump sites and upgrade solid waste sites that present a health hazard on Indian lands and Alaska Native lands, pursuant to the Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act of 19944, and pending coordination with the EPA on oversight and evaluation of Tribal solid waste management programs. Approximately $4 million will support emergency and special projects : o Emergency projects address water supply and waste disposal emergencies caused by natural disasters or other unanticipated situation that require immediate attention to avoid a health hazard or to protect the Federal investment in sanitation facilities. Special projects include: Updating the inventory of open dumps currently identified in the IHS data system to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act (PL103 - 399), Incorporating a geographical information system (GIS) functionality into the SFC Program data system. o The primary benefit of incorporating a GIS into the SFC Program's data system is to improve the Program's ability to access, store and update sanitation facilities composite as- built drawings. The graphical interface will allow for the collection, uploading and editing of field- collected data on installed sanitation facilities. It will allow user s to update sanitation facilities as-built drawings for the purpose of aiding in needs identification, planning, design, construction, and technical assistance. Enhancements of the SFC Program data system to facilitate development of an improved user interface, reporting, and program oversight. Research studies, training, or other needs related to sanitation facilities construction.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93- 638 Self - Determination Contracts and Self -Governance Compacts Construction Project Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service ( IHS) Health Care Facilities Construction (HCFC) funds provide optimum availability of functional, modern IHS and tribally operated health care facilities and where required staff quarters. The IHS is authorized to construct health care facilities and staff quarters, support Tribal construction of facilities under the Joint Venture Construction Program (JVCP), provide construction funding for Tribal projects Under the S mall Ambulatory Program (SAP) , and provide funding to construct new and replacement dental uni ts. The construction and modernization of IHS infrastructure through the health care facilities construction program helps ensure the IHS commitment to the Department of Health and Human Services Strategic Objectives 1.2: Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition; and 1.3: Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choice of care and service options. The health care facilities constructed by the IHS ensure access to quality, culturally competent health c are for one of the lowest income populations in the United States, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The focus of the IHS health care service programs provided in these facilities is on prevention and delivery of comprehensive primary care in a community setting. The HCFC program is funded based on an IHS-wide list of priorities for construction projects. During FY 1990, at the direction of Congress , the IHS established the Health Facilities Construction Priority System (HFCPS) methodology. The HFCPS ranks proposals using factors reflecting the total amount of space needed , age and condition of the existing health care facility, if any, degree of isolation of the population to be served in the proposed health care facility , and availability of alternate health care resources. The remaining health care facilities projects on the HFCPS list, inclu ding those partially funded, total approximately $2.00 billion as of January 2021. The reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) includes a provision, \"any project established under the construction priority system in effect on the date of enactment of the Act of 2009 shall not be affected by any change in the construction priority system taking place after that date... \" Total need for the HCFC Program is approximately CJ - 228$15 billion for expanded and active authority facility types according to The 2016 Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Care Facilities' Needs Assessment Report to Congress. The Joint Venture Construction Program ( JVCP ) authorizes IHS to enter into agreements with Tribes that construct their own health care facilities. The Tribe provides the resources, whether from its own funds, through financing, grants, contributions, or a combination thereof, for the construction of its health care facility . IHS health care facility construction appropriations are not used for construction of facilities in the JVCP but may be used to equip the health care facility. Tribes apply for the JVCP during a competitive process and the approved projects are enter ed into agreements with IHS. B ased on the date of projected completion of construction by the respective Tribe, the IHS agrees to request a funding increase from Congress for additional staffing and operations consistent with a fully executed beneficial occupancy of the health care facility. The Small Ambulatory Program (SAP) provides funding for small T ribal health care facilities . The SAP is authorized by Section 306 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, Public Law 94-437, and projects are competitively selected for funding as funds are appropriated. The SAP program is available for AI /AN Tribes or T ribal organizat ions to competitively obtain funding for the construction, expansion or modernization of tribally owned small ambulatory health care facilities. The selected projects will not be a part of the IHS HFCPS. These three programs implement the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 by increasing access to culturally appropriate health care services for American Indian and Alaska Native people. IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 is supported when a new facility is completed . A new facility is designed to meet the demand for health services from a growing population by providing more healthcare providers and exam rooms, dentists and dental chairs, improved imaging systems, and expanded services such as eye care and audiology. Each new facility includes a component to address behavioral health issues. Administration staff is increased to strengthen management, collections and bring health care quality expertise to the replacement facility. Each facility also incorporates additional space for Tribal health programs which compl ements IHS programs and how the HCFC programs are implementing. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Each healthcare facility project that is completed increases access to much needed health care services. Each completed replacement facility is typically larger to meet the increased demand for health services from a growing population. Tribes typically provide land, at no cost to the Federal Government, for the new or replacement health care facility. During FY 2020, no facility was completed , but all of the remaining projects on the grandfathered priority list prog ressed toward completion. The FY 2020 appropriation completed funding for the Rapid City Health Center in Rapid City, SD; Alamo Health Center, Alamo, NM: Pueblo Pintado Health Center, Whiteriver Hospital, Whiteriver, AZ; Bodaway Gap Health Center, The Gap, AZ; and Albuquerque West Health Center, Albuquerque, NM. The FY 2020 appropriation also contributed $25 million to the IHS SAP and $10 million to the Staff Quarters Program. The select ion and agreements to award the funds will be compete in May 2021. CJ - 229The FY 2021 appropriation completed funding for the Albuquerque West Health Center, Albuquerque, NM and contributed to the Whiteriver Hospital, Whiteriver, AZ; Bodaway Gap Health Center, The Gap, AZ ; Albuquerque Central Health Center, Albuquerque, NM and Sells Alternative Rural Hospital, Sells, AZ projects. The FY 2021 appropriation also contributed $25 million to the IHS SAP and $10 million to the Staff Quarters Program. The selection and agreements to award the funds is beginning in late FY 2021. The JVCP has saved the Federal Government over $1 billion dollars in capital expenses since its inception. The outcome of the JVCP provides the same accomplishments as described above. The federal construction and the Joint Venture programs bring new and increased health care capacity to AI/AN communities where there is a great need. These activit ies increase the access to quality healthcare in these underserved communities. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2018 $243,480,000 2019 $243,480 ,000 2020 $259,290 ,000 2021 Enacted $259,290 Budget $525,781 ,000 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2022 budget submission for Health Care Facilities Construction is $526 m illion , which is $266 . FY 2022 Funding includes: Current Services of +$603,000 including: Inflation +$603,000 to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. Health Care Facilities Construction : +$266 million - to support the remaining projects on the 1993 IHS Health Care Facilities Construction Priority List. These health care facilities will improve access to direct health care services. The total $526 million funding request for FY 2022 would support: Phoenix Indian Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ $70 million These funds will be used to begin design of the facility and possibly purchase land if the site evaluation requires. The new Phoenix Indian Medical Center Health Care System is planned to decentralize a substantial portion of the primary care services workload to three new satellite facilities. The three satellite facilities are located in the southwest valley, the southeast valley, and in the northeast valley. The satellite facilities are located closer to the user's communities to provide more access to care. A new Central facility will be a major resource to the satellite facilities. The Central facility will be designed and equipped with full telemedicine support and visiting professionals to provide specialty care services, and will continue to serve as a referral hospital for specialty consultation and procedures. CJ - 230 Whiteriver Hospital, Whiteriver, AZ $100 million These funds will be used to continue construction of the replacement hospital. It will serve a p rojected user population of 36,113 providing 67,000 primary care provider visits and 101,200 outpatient visits annually. This project also includes an estimated 144 staff quarters for health care professionals serving at the facility. Gallup Indian Medi cal Center , Gallup, NM $68 million These funds will be used to provide infrastructure and purchase land for the facility . The proposed replacement G allup Indian Medical Center will provide comprehensive inpatient, ambulatory, behavioral, and preventive health services for the G allup S ervice U nit. The projects will also provide specialty care and inpatient care services to support other Navajo Area service units. Bodaway Gap He alth Center, The Gap, AZ $30 million These funds will be used to complete construction of the 82 staff quarters located in The Gap, AZ. The Health Center will serve a projected user population of 4,646 generating 18,458 primary care provider visits annually. The facility will provide an expanded outpatient and community health department, and a full array of ancillary and support services. Albuquerque Central Health Center, Albuquerque, NM $75 million These funds will be used for construction of the health center located in central Albuquerque, NM. The Health Center will serve a projected user population of 15,500 generating 59,300 primary care provider visits annually. The facility will provide an expanded outpatient and community health department, and a full array of ancillary and support services. Sells Health Center, Sells, AZ $120 million These funds will continue construction of the health center and staff quarters in the Sells , AZ. The Sells Health Center will consist of approximately 210,000 GSF of space. The Health Center will serve a projected user population of 21,400 generating 38,200 primary care provider visits annually. The facility will provide an expanded outpatient and community health department, and a full array of ancillary and support services. New and Replacement Staff Quarters $ 25 million Many of the 2,700 quarters across the IHS health delivery system are more than 40 years old and in need of major renovation or total replacement. Additionally, in a number of locations the amount of housing units is insufficient. The identified unmet need, of housing units in isolated, remote locations is a significant barrier to the recruitment and retention of quality healthcare professionals across Indian Count ry. The amount distributed to each Area will be based on each Area's internal priority list. Small Ambulatory $33 million These resources would support up to 10 small ambulatory facilities in American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Consistent with prior years, the IHS will request applications from interested Tribes. Funds will support for construction, expansion or modernization of non-IHS owned small Tribal ambulatory health care facilities located apart from a hospital. Green Infrastructure: $5 million The Indian Health Service will use these funds to incorporate green infrastructure CJ - 231and the most current energy efficiency codes and standards available in its planning, design, and operations of buildings to the maximum extent practicable. This approach will reduce costs, minimize environmental impacts, and use renewable energy.

Permanent Allocation .................................................................................................... 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts and competitive cooperative agreements SUMMARY OF PROGRAM S Facilities and Environmental Health Support Account (FEHS) programs provide and support an extensive array of real property, health care facilities and staff quarters construction, maintenance and operation services, as well as community and institutional environmental health, injury prevention, and sanitat ion facilities construction services. The programs directly and indirectly support all of the IHS facilities performance measures and improved access to quality health services. The programs and staff at the IHS Headquarters, Area Office, and Service Unit levels work collaboratively with Tribes and other agencies to promote and provide access to CJ - 233 improvements in public health through surveillance, education, intervention activities, construction of sanitation facilities and health care facilities. These activities are aligned in sub - activities: Facilities Support, Environmental Health Support, and Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Support. In addition to personnel salary and benefits costs, funding under this activity is used for utilities, certain non-medical supplies and personal property, and biomedical equipment repair. The IHS may use a limited amount of these FEHS funds for centrally charged assessments that benefit the staff and activities funded through the Indian Health Facilities a ppropriations. To date, the majority of IHS's assessments have been paid through the Indian Health Services appropriation; however, the amount of assessment costs have exceeded the amount of funds available within Services. In order to continue the emphasi s on direct patient care, these FEHS funds that provide other types of administrative support for the Facilities appropriation may share in appropriate assessment charges proportionate to the underlying activities. For example, a centrally managed assessment for payroll services that is charged by the number of employees may be proportionately paid under both the Services and Facilities appropriations according to the number of staff supported by each appropriation. FACILITIES SUPPORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Facilities Support Account (FS) provides funding for Area and Service Unit staff for facilities - related management activities, operation and maintenance of real property and building systems, medical equipment technical support, and planning and construction management support for new and replacement health facilities projects. The sub- activity directly supports the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 priorities: (1) People - Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, caring workforce collaborating to achieve the IHS mission ; (2) Partnerships- Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships that advance the IHS mission ; (3) Quality - Excellence in everything we do to assure a high-performing Indian health system; and (4) R esources- Secure and effectively manage the assets needed to promote the IHS mission. The IHS owns approximately 10,245,000 square feet of facilities (totaling 2,122 buildings) and 1,775 acres of federal and trust land. The nature of space varies from sophisticated medical centers to residential units and utility plants. Facilities range in age from less than one year to more than 168 years, with an average age greater than 40 years. A professional and fully- functional workforce is essential to ensure effective and efficient operations. An estimated 600 Federal positions (fulltime equivalents) are funded under this sub- activity. Typical staff functions funded may include: Facilities engineers and maintenance staff responsible for ensuring that building systems are operated properly, facilities and grounds are maintained adequately, utilities are managed appropriately, environmental compliance requirements are met, and buildings are safe; Specialized clinical engineers and technicians who maintain and service medical equipment; Realty staff that manages the real property requirements and quarters; and Facilities planning , project management, and construction- monitoring that assist in the planning and construction of projects. In addition, FS provides partial funding for related Area and Service Unit operating costs, such as utilities, building operation supplies, facilities-related personal property, and biomedical CJ - 234 equipment repair and maint enance. Accomplishments include supporting health delivery through the attainment of accreditation and the maintenance of the environment of care of buildings, utility systems, life safety systems, and medical equipment. Adequate facilities/maintenance staffing both at the Area Offices and service units are paramount to maintain accreditation, for the continuity of health services, and ensur ing that major building system s function correctly . Workload for the facilities and biomedical staff has continued to increase to meet the Agency's emphasis on accreditation standards and supporting program enhancements/expansion, which is predominately funded with collections. The Facilities Management Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people; Objective 1.1: Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, and O bjective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services. Additionally, Facilities Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023, Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations ; Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources . In consultation with Tribes and the Federal healthcare sites, IHS is coordinating with and allocating funding to the IHS Area Offices to complete BEMAR projects to make renovations and improvements necessary to support health care de livery in the health care facilities and to modernize the health care facilities and staff quarters to expand access to quality health care services including modern medical equipment. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Maintaining effective and efficient healthcare buildings and equipment improve the ease and access to care, facilitate successful behavioral health services, and enable the hiring and retention of healthcare professionals by giving them modern space and equipment to deliver services. This is all integral to quality health care for AI/ANs. The Facilities Support Account and associated staffing level directly supports to the medical equipment, maintenance and repair of, and adjustments/modifications to IHS and Tribal healthcare sites to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus/COVID -19 medical services. In FY 2020, total utility costs were $15 million and total utility costs per Gross Square Feet (GSF) were $2.86/GSF. In FY 2022, the total utility cost is expected to be $15 million re flecting a 2.0 percent annual increase. The cost per GSF is expected to rise to approximately $3.02/GSF. IHS makes conscious efforts to help stem the growth in utility costs to ensure appropriations are sufficient to fund these needs. For example, IHS constructs new space that is at least 30 percent more energy efficient than building code requires and expects LEED Silver certification at those facilities. Additionally, IHS seeks opportunities to fund renewable energy systems at IHS and tribally owned installations. For example, a current project is installing additional solar panels at the Fort Yuma Health Care Center in Yuma, Arizona, which has the potential to make the site net zero electricity. CJ - 235 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Environmental Health Support Account (EHSA) provides funding for IHS Area, District, and Service Unit management activities and environmental health staff which include engineers, environmental health officers, engineering aides, injury prevention spe cialists, and institutional environmental health officers. More than 70 percent of these IHS and Tribal staff live and work in Tribal communities; another 20 percent provide regional services to Tribes or IHS facilities; and less than 10 percent of our st aff are administrative managers. AI/ANs face hazards in their environments that affect their health status, including communities in remote and isolated locations, severe climatic conditions, limited availability of safe housing, lack of safe water supply, and lack of publi c health and safety legislation (e.g., lack of local solid waste ordinances, vehicle safety laws, or food safety laws). In accordance with congressional direction, these funds are distributed to the Areas based upon the workload and need associated with the two programs noted below. Sanitation Facilities Construction Program (SFC) - This program is an integral component of IHS disease prevention activities. IHS has carried out the program since 1959 using funds appropriated for SFC to provide safe water supply and waste disposal facilities for AI/AN people and communities. As a result, infant mortality rates and mortality rates for gastroenteritis and other environmentally -related diseases have been reduced. Research supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states populations in regions with a lower proportion of home s with water service, reflect significantly higher hospitalization rates for pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. 1 Researchers associate the increasing illnesses with the restricted access to clean water for hand washing and hygiene. The absence of clean water to sanitation facilities for tribal households exacerbate concern for the Indian Health Service Clinical Health Care program; fu rther decreasing the quality of life for A I/ANs . Efforts by other public health specialists such as nutritionists and public health nurses are much more effective when safe water and adequate wastewater disposal systems are available in the home. In addition, the availability of such facilities is of fu ndamental importance to social and economic development, which leads to an improved quality of life and an improved sense of well-being. The SFC Program works collaboratively with tribes to assure all AI/AN homes and communities are provided with safe and adequate water supply and waste disposal systems as soon as possible (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships) . Under this program in FY 2020, staff managed and/or provided professional engineering services for 545 new sanitation projects with a total cost of over $ 302 million , including IHS funds and contributions from Tribes and other agencies. The program manages annual project funding that includes contributions from Tribes, states, and other federal agencies. The SFC Program is the environmental engineering component of the IHS health delivery system. Services funded include management of staff, pre -planning, consultation with Tribes, coordination with other federal, state and local governmental entities, identifying supplemental funding outside of IHS, developing local policies and guidelines with Tribal consultation, developing agreements with Tribes and others for each 1 Thomas W.

CJ - 236 project, providing professional engineering design and/or construction services for water supply and waste disposal facilities, assuring environmental and historical preservation procedures are followed, and assisting Tribes where the Tribes provide construction management. Consistent with the 1994 Congressional set aside for \"...tribal training on the operation and maintenance of sanitation facilities,\" $1 million of these support funds are used for technical assistance, traini ng, and guidance to Indian families and communities regarding the operation and maintenance of water supply and sewage disposal facilities. In accordance with the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the staff annually updates its inventory of sanitation f acilities deficiencies for existing Indian occupied homes. 2 This is accomplished through extensive consultation with Tribes. The SFC staff also develops and updates an inventory of all open dump sites on Indian lands as required under the Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act.3 Both of these inventories are widely used by other governmental agencies in their evaluation and funding of sanitation facilities construction projects. Enviro nmental Health Services (EHS) - National priority areas include: food safety, children's environments, healthy homes, vector borne and communicable disease, and safe drinking water. The EHS Program identifies environmental hazards and risk factors in Tribal communities and proposes cont rol measures to prevent adverse health effects. The EHS Program monitors and investiga tes disease and injury . The program provides inspections to identify environmental hazards in homes, healthcare facilities, food service establishments, Head Start cent ers, and many other types of Tribal establishments. In addition, EHS provides training, technical assistance, and cooperative agreements to enhance the capacity of Tribal communities to address environmental health issues. HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, 3 and 5 (see goal descriptions below) EHS provides access to public health services to AI/ANs. Examples include referrals for home investigations to reduce environmental triggers for asthma patients; home investigations to reduce exposure to lead -based paint or other lead hazards (including drinking water sources) for patients with elevated blood -lead levels; animal bite investigations in Tribal communities and potential patient exposure to rabies virus; home investigations to address fall risk for elderly and other patients at risk for falls; and referrals for investigation of community disease outbreaks from multiple patient exposures to contaminated food or water. HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 and 3 (see goal descriptions below) The IHS Injury Prevention Prog ram (IPP) leads IHS efforts to address injury disparities between AI/AN communities and U.S. all races. AI/AN experience injury mortality rates that are 2.5 to 8.7 times higher than the U. S. all races rates 4. The IPP works with AI/AN, other agencies, a nd IHS programs to prevent unintentional injuries (motor vehicle-related, falls, burns, drowning, poisoning) and intentional injuries (suicide and violence- related) through technical assistance, training, and the Tribal Injury Prevention Cooperative Agreement Program (TIPCAP). Technical assistance is provided in the areas of data collection for project evaluation, building partnerships, implementing evidence- based strategies or innovative interventions, and developing tribal injury prevention programs. HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 and 3 (see goal descriptions below) 2 Title III, Section 302(g) 1 and 2 of P.L. 94 -437. 3 P.L. 103 -399. 4 Trends in Indian Health 2017 Edition, IHS, Division of Program Statistics CJ - 237 The IHS Institutional Environmental Health (IEH) Program identifies hazards and risk factors in the built environment and proposes control measures to prevent adverse health effects to patients, staff, and visitors in health care and other community facilities. The IEH program supports development and management of safe, functional health care facilities which contributes to the quality of care and workforce retention. The IEH progra m collaborates with entities such as the National Institutes of Health, Administration for Children and Families, and Uniformed Services University to improve IEH practices in IHS facilities and in our tribal communities. HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 and 3 (see goal descriptions below) HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2: Protect the Health of Americans Where They Live, Learn, Work, and Play by: Preventing and Controlling communicable and environmental diseases; and Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies. HHS Strategic Plan Goal 3: Strengthen the Economic and Social Well- Being of Americans across the Lifespan by Safeguarding the public against preventable injuries and violence or their results. HHS Strategic Goal 5: Promoting Effective and Efficient Management and Stewardship. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Environmental Health Services (EHS) staff have been involved with all aspects and at all levels of the National COVID -19 Pandemic response. The Division of Environmental Health Services has collaborated with Federal partners such as, National Indian Gaming Commission, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of the Interior, and the Bureau of Indian Education by serving as Subject Matter Experts for policy and guidance on the reopening of Tribal gaming facilities and tribal schools nationally. EHS staff remain focused on the community- based environmental health services by assisting tribal operations and businesses plan and prepare to reopen during COVID-19. EHS staff throughout the Indian Health Service are serving in critical leadership positions of the COVID -19 response. For example, many Environmental Health staff serve as Incident Commanders, Safety Officers, Emergency Management Points-of-Contact, Logistics Chief, and Liaisons to state and local emergency management entities. EHS staff accomplishments reduce the need for direct healthcare services when environmentally related diseases and injuries are prevented . For example , the IHS Injury Prevention Program has been instrumental in reducing the injury mortality rate of AI/ANs by implementing a public health approach based upon effective strategies and initiatives to reduce the devastating burden of injuries. Preventing severe, debilitating injuries reduce s the cost and need for healthcare service ; however, the challenge remai ns that unintentional injuries are still the leading cause of death for AI/ANs ages 1 -44. 5 From 1997-2021 the TIPCAP funded 106 fulltime tribal injury prevention positions and provided over $34 million in funding. Through these efforts the IHS IPP has contributed to the 58 percent decrease in injury mortality rates since 197 3 and continues to invest in preventing injuries in the first place, instead of treating the impacts of injury and violence through our health care delivery system. 4 Indian Health Focus: Injuries, 2017 Edition CJ - 238 President's Manag ement Agenda Goal 3 Cross Agency Priority Goal - Develop ing a W orkforce for the 21st Century. The IEH Program provides extensive technical assistance and training to safety and facility management staff as well as the many inter- related medical program and leadership staff. These efforts have led to a reduction in the IHS total occupational injury case rate which has decreased from 4.35 injuries/100 employees in 2004 to 1.54 injuries/100 employees in 2019. The IEH program supports healthcare management by providing local accreditation support including mock environment of care surveys in which regulatory requirements and conditions for general safety, environmental infection control, fire safety, and chemical safety are a ssessed and recommendations for corrective action are provided. The IEH Program works to foster multi- disciplinary engagement amongst all levels of the organization to improve transparency and efficiency. Staff engage Tribal, county, and state public health and public safety officials i n Tribal communities. For example, staff engage local Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement or Tribal police to enhance motor vehicle related injury prevention efforts through child safety seat interventions and enhanced police enforcement activities such as seat belt usage or driving un der the influence checkpoints. Staff work extensi vely with Tribal, county, and state health departments on a variety of public health issues including response to foodborne (i.e., salmonellosis), vectorborne (i.e., bubonic plague, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, hantavirus), and waterborne (i.e. legionellosis) disease outbreaks. Other examples of collaboration include surveillance activities related to emerging diseases and public health emergency preparedness.

CJ - 240 Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2021 Target FY 2022 Protection Manager (CFPM) (Output) In FY 2016, a national baseline was established for EHS -3 and EHS -4 at 64 percent and 5 .1 percent, respectively. In FY 2018, 64 percent of drivers wore seat belts (EHS -3) and 3.4 percent of food borne illness risk factors were out of compliance (EHS -4). In FY 2019, 69.5 percent of drivers wore seat belts (EHS -3) and 3.5 percent of food borne illness risk factors were out of complianc e (EHS - 4). The FY 2020 target is based on 100 percent of all participating Areas distributing best practices and highlighting challenges to Tribes. *The FY 2020 targets are not comparable to FY 2019. FY 21 targets were set from FY 2020 WebEHRS data . Performance Discussion Injury Intervention: During the 2016-2020 performance cycle, in FY 2016, Area EHS Programs identif ied targeted communities from which a national baseline measure of seatbelt use was developed (64 percent). For the FY 2017 target, 8 of 10 (80 percent) of the Area programs implement ed comprehensive interventions using at least three effective strategies to increase seatbelt usage rate in targeted Tribal communities. Examples include: d eveloping or strengthening tribal seat belt laws, increas ing partnerships with T ribal police , provid ing classroom curriculum for motor vehicle crash prevention at reservation schools. For the FY 2018 target, measure interim seat belt use to determine effectiveness of interventions and propose adjustments to interventions based on interim driver seat belt use findings. It was found that 64 percent of drivers wore seat belts (no change from the FY 2016 baseline year) and Areas modified their strategies to address identified intervention barriers. In FY 2019, Area programs conducted their final driver seat belt use rates. It was found that 69.5 percent of drivers used their seat belt. The results show an 8 percent increase in observed seat belt use when compared to the 64 percent baseline. In FY 2020, ninety percent of the Area programs shared their identified best practices and challenges with Tribes and EHS staff highlighted interventions which had the greatest impact in improving driver seat belt usage. The EHS programs are expected to incorporat e the best practices to prevent injuries and deaths due to injuries. Best practices included enhanced trainings; effective interventions; and improved injury prevention outreach and collaboration with tribal partners. IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people. Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services. HHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2.2. Environmental Surveillance: During the 2016-2020 performance cycle, in FY 2016, Area EHS Programs identif ied targeted Tribal Head Start and non -residential day care establishments from which a national baseline of foodborne illness risk factors was calculated (5.1 percent). For the FY 2017 target, 10 of 10 (100 percent) of the Areas implement ed and report ed comprehensive interventions using at least three effective strategies to decrease food risk factor deficiencies at targeted Tribal Head Start a nd non- residential day care establishments. Examples include: develop ing and implement ing active managerial control and corrective action plan processes with local operators , focusing food inspection s urveys on targeted risk factors, and providing a ccess to training through the IHS Online Food Handlers Training Course. For the FY 2018 target, conduct an interim assessment of poor employee health and hygiene foodborne illness risk factors to determine effectiveness of interventions and adjust interventions based on interim findings . It was found that 3.4 percent of food borne illness risk factors were out of compliance (a decrease from the FY 2016 baseline year) and Areas continued their comprehensive interventions. In FY 2019, Area programs conducted thei r final assessments and data collection and found that 3.5 percent of foodborne illness risk factors were out of compliance. The results showed a 31 percent CJ - 241 reduction in foodborne illness risk factors that were out of compliance when compared to the 5.1 percent baseline. In FY 2020. Ninety percent of the Area programs shared their identified best practices and challenges with Tribes. The EHS programs are expected to incorporate these best practices into their delivery of environmental health services. Best practices include conducting training, focused surveys, and audits based on identified deficiencies; and use of data to drive annual performance improvement; IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and publi c health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people. Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services. HHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2.2. The FY 2016 - 2020 EHS performance measures focused on reducing the risk of foodborne illness in children's environments and reducing the risk of motor vehicle- related injuries and deaths through increased use of seatbelts. Barriers that may have impacted the program's ability to meet these targets includ ed competing local, regional and national priorities (e.g., COVID-19), staff turn -over, lapsed vacant positions, and a decentralized approach to program management that can result in non- standardized processes across the country. To help mitigate these ba rriers , EHS provided ongoing competency development through specialized training programs; strategic planning efforts that support uniform program management; and data management tools to support local staff. In FY 2021- 2025, a new performance cycle is established with two new measures. The EHS -5 measure is the number of persons who received injury prevention training. This measure focusses on the importance of injury prevention training in building the capacity of staff and tribes to prevent injuries and deaths due to injuries in tribal communities . In FY 2021, data from the web- based environmental health reporting system, WebEHRS, was used to report the number of people trained in injur y prevention in FY 2020. Because of the focus on COVID- 19 activities in FY 2020 and FY 2021, the target for FY2021 was determined to be to maintain the baseline number of 154 people trained. The EHS -6 measure is the percent of food establishments with a C ertified Food Protection Manager (CFPM). This measure uses WebEHRS to track the number of food service establishments (restaurants and kitchens within other establishments) with a Certified Food Protection Manager (CFPM). This performance measure focusses on a proven strategy in the reduction of foodborne illnesses and with aligns with the DEHS Operational Model and 10 essential environmental health services. FY 2020 WebEHRS data was used to determine the baseline CFPM percent ( 86.7 percent). Because of t he continuing focus on COVID-19, the FY 2021 target was determined to be to maintain the baseline percent (70) of food establishments with a CFPM present at time of inspection. GRANT AWARDS In FY 2020, the TIPCAP 2016-2020 Five year Funding cycle was completed. In FY 2021, the Injury Prevention Program solicited for TIPCAP Injury Prevention projects and awarded 27 Tribes (five year funding cycle) for $2.5 million per year. OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND ENGINEERING SUPPORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION CJ - 242 The IHS Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Support activity (OEHE) provides funds for executive management activities, personnel, contracts, contractors, and operating costs for the OEHE Headquarters. Personnel have manage ment responsibility for IHS facilities and environmental health programs, provide direct technical services and support to Area personnel, perform management functions and have responsibility for all construction contracting in excess of $150,000. Management activities include: national policy development and implementation budget formulation, project review and approval congressional report preparation quality assurance (e.g., internal control reviews, Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act activities and other oversight) technical assistance (e.g., consultation and training) construction contracting long range planning meetings (with HHS, Tribes, and other federal agencies) recruitment and retention efforts. Typical direct support functions are: Project officers and contracting officer representatives for health care facilities construction projects: reviewing and/or writing technical justification documents, participating in design reviews and site surveys, conducting onsite inspections, and monitoring project funding status. Staff support real property asset management requirements. These actions are to ensure management accountability and the efficient and economic use of federal real property. Staff serving as contracting officer representatives and project officers in support of data systems, cooperative agreements, inter- agency agreements, and community -based projects. In accordance with appropriation committee direction, OEHE staff develop, maintain, and utilize data systems to distribute Facilities Appropriation resources to Area offices for facilities and environmental health activities and construction administration and management, based upon workload and need. Also, technical guidance, information, and training are provided throughout the IHS system in support of the Facilities Appropriation. Office of Environmental Health and Engineering (OEHE) Support advances the H HS Strategic Plan Goal 1: Reform, Strengthen, and Modernize the Nation's Healthcare System by increasing access to healthcare and strengthening the healthcare workforce to meet diverse needs. OEHE Support advances the H HS Strategic Plan Goal 2: Protect the Health of Americans Where They Live, Learn, Work, and Play by: Preventing and Controlling communicable and environmental diseases; and Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies. Additionally, OEHE Support furthers H HS Strategic Goal 5: Promoting Effective and Efficient Management and Stewardship. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The following are activities which focus on the IHS mission and priorities: review and approval of P rogram J ustification Documents (PJDs) and P rogram O f Requirements (PORs) CJ - 243 announcement and review of Joint Venture and Small Ambulatory projects awarding and monitoring contracts for all aspects of the Facilities Appropriation, including all types of construction contracts and 638 construction project agreements. OEHE coordinating construction, environmental health, and real property activities through the 12 Area Offices to ensure program consistency, to ensure the most effective use of resources across IHS, and to support field programs through budget preparation and required reporting, thus ensuring the most effective, accountable use of resources to improve access to quality healthcare services. OEHE strengthens the overall management of IHS by reviewing and approving the planning documents for health care facilities construction projects called PJDs and PORs. OEHE also reviews joint venture and small ambulatory projects which address assessing health care and improving health care delivery. These programs include behavioral health services. These programs include behavioral health services. The OEHE facilities programs integrate strategic planning, performance, and program integrity into the office's daily business practices. One example is the Sanitation Facilities Construction Strategic planning efforts and identification of needs ( Strategy 1, \" Improve the transparency and quality of data collected regarding health care service and program outcomes \" from IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization ). Implementation of th is plan has improved project management, reduced project durations and transformed the data system used by IHS and federal partners to manage sanitation programs in Indian country. Another example is the Environmental Health program strategic visioning and the Ten Essential Environmental Health Services as a framework. Implementation of these initiatives is ongoing.

Authorizing Legislation ......................................................................... 25 U.S.C. 13, Snyder Act; 42 U.S.C. 2001, Transfer Act; Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), as amended 2010 FY 2022 Authorization ..................................................................................................... Permanent Allocation .................................................................................................... 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Equipment funds are used for maintenance, upgrades, replacement, and the purchase of new medical equipment systems at Indian Health Service ( IHS) and Tribal healthcare facilities. It directly supports the Agency's priorities of Partnerships and Quality. Accurate clinical diagnosis and effective therapeutic procedures depend in large part on health care prov iders using modern and effective medical equipment/systems to assure the best possible health diagnosis. The IHS and Tribal health programs manage approximately 90,000 devices consisting of laboratory, medical imaging, patient monitoring, pharmacy, and other biomedical, diagnostic, and patient equipment valued at approximately $700 million. With today's medical devices/systems having an average life expectancy of appro ximately six to eight years and rapid technological advancements, medical equipment replacement is a continual process making it necessary to replace worn out equipment or provide equipment with newer technology to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnos is and treatment. To replace the equipment at the end of its six to eight -year life would require approximately $100 million per year. Many of the IHS hospital administrators reported that old or inadequate physical environments challenged their ability to provide quality care and maintain compliance with the Medicare Hospital Conditions of Participation. Further, the administrators reported that maintaining agin g buildings and equipment is a major challenge. O ver one third of all IHS hospitals ' deficiencies have been found to be related to facilities with some failing on infection control criteria and others having malfunctioning exit doors. CJ - 245Equipment Funds Allocation Method In FY 2021, the IHS Equipment funds were allocated in four categories: Tribally -constructed health care facilities, TRANSAM program, Tribal emergency generator, and new and replacement equipment: 1. Tribally -Constructed Health Care Facilities - The IHS provides medical equipment funds to support the initial purchase of equipment for tribally- constructed health care facilities. FY 2021 funds support approximately $5 million for competitive awards to Tribes and Tribal organizations t hat construct new or expand health care facilities space using non - IHS funding sources. Tribes and Tribal organizations will use these funds to serve approximately 500,000 patients with newly purchased medical equipment. 2. TRANSAM Program - Equipment funds may be used to acquire new and like- new excess medical equipment from the Department of Defense (DoD) or other sources through the TRANSAM (i.e., Transfer of DoD Excess Medical and Other Supplies to Native Americans) Program and to procure ambulances for IHS and Tribal emergency medical services programs. 1 FY 2021 appropriations included $500,000 for the TRANSAM Program from the Equipment budget. Under the TRANSAM Program, excess equipment and supplies, at an annual estimated value of $5 million, are acquired for distribution to federal and Tribal sites. 3. Tribal Emergency Generator - The IHS provides medical equipment funds to support the purchase of emergency generators at T ribally -operated health care facilities. FY 2021 funds support approximately $1 million for Tribal Health Programs located in areas impacted by de- energization events. Funding is allocated to the Tribal Health Program using the IHS ISDEAA compact/contract. 4. New and Replacement Equipment - Approximately $23 million will be allocated to IHS and Tribal health care facilities to maintain existing and purchase new medical equipment, including the replacement of existing equipment used in diagnosing illnesses. The funding allocation is formula based. The Facilities Management Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people; Objective 1.1: Recruit , develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, and Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services. Additionally, Facilities Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations; Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources. IHS Strategic Plan and how the Facilities programs are implementing: In consultation with Tribes and the Federal healthcare sites, IHS is allocating funding to the IHS Area Offices to replace and modernize medical equipment to support health care delivery and expand access to quality health care services. 1 The IHS Facilities appropriation limits total expenditures up to $500,000 for equipment purchased through the TRANSAM Program . CJ - 246FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2018 $23,706,000 2019 $23,706 ,000 2020 $28,087 ,000 2021 Enacted $29,087 Budget $100,640 ,000 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2022 budget submission for Equipment is $ 101 m illion , which is $72 million above the FY . FY 2022 Funding includes: Current Services of +$640,000 including: Inflation : +$134,000 to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. Population Growth: +$506,000 to address the impact of the additional services need arising from the growing AI/AN. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. Equipment: +$71 million for maintenance and upgrades for existing medical equipment, and procurement of new medical equipment to replace units that are at the end of their useable lifecycle at IHS and Tribal healthcare facilities. Accurate clinical diagnosis and effective therapeutic procedures depend in large part on health care providers using modern and effective medical equipment and systems to assure the best possible health diagnosis. IHS and Tribal health programs manage approximately 90,000 devices consisting of laboratory, medical imaging, patient monitoring, pharmacy, and other biomedical, diagnostic, and patient equipment valued at approximately $700 million. Today's medical devices and systems have an average life expectancy of approximately six to eight years. The average six year life cycle combined with rapid technological advancements means that medical equipment replacement is a continuous process that requires the replacement of aging equipment, and equipment that does not meet newer technological standards, to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment. To replace equipment at IHS and Tribal health facilities at the end of its six -year life would require appr oximately $100 million per year, growing at an approximate 2 percent inflation rate per year. The FY 2022 funding request would be a substantial investment toward addressing critical equipment needs. Along with aging buildings, aging equipment presents cha llenges for maintaining accreditation, providing high quality care and ensuring patient safety. It also affects the recruitment and retention of high quality health care professionals. Having access to modern equipment and the ability to maintain skills a nd training on particular devices or equipment are important factors in our providers' decisions about working for IHS. CJ - 247The total $101 million funding request for FY 2022 would support: Approximately $94 million for new and routine replacement medical equipment to over 1,500 federally and tribally- operated healthcare facilities; $5 million for new medical equipment in tribally -constructed health care facilities; $1 million for emergency generators at Tribal Health Programs located in areas impacted by de- energization events; and $500,000 for the TRANSAM program. OUTPUT S / OUTCOME S This program measures outcomes through its inventory of medical equipment. Maintaining and fielding modern medical equipment improve the ease and access to care, enhance the diagnostic capabilities leading to better health outcomes, and enable the hiring and retention of healthcare professionals by giving them modern space and equipment with which t o deliver services. IHS targets Equipment funding and supplements these funds with collections where available, toward equipment purchases to reduce the backlog of over -age equipment and field new, state-of- the-art equipment and systems. A few examples of these purchases include: d igital x -ray systems (dental , 3D panora full radiology rooms, 3D computed tomography), optometry equipment (visual simultaneous optical coherence tomography), lab analyzer s for in-house testing, sterilization equipment, specialized microscopes, patient lifting equipment, picture archiving & communications systems (PACS) , central patient monitoring systems, and ultrasound systems. This equipment will improve diagnostic capabilities, provide faster analysis, and facilitate provision of services t o American Indian and Alaska Native communities .

The operation, maintenance, and improvement costs of the staff quarters are funded with this funding designated as Quarters Return (QR) funds, i.e., the rent collected from tenants residing in the quarters. The use of the funds includes maintenance personnel services, security guard services, repairs to housing units and associated grounds, purchase of materials, supp lies, and household appliances/equipment (e.g., stoves, water heaters, furnaces, etc.). In certain situations, Maintenance and Improvement Program funds may be used, in conjunction with QR funds, to ensure adequate quarters' maintenance. For example, this may be necessary in locations with few quarters where QR funds are insuffi cient to pay for all required maintenance costs. The Facilities Management Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people; Objective 1.1: Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, and Objective 1.3: Increase access to qualit y health care services. Additionally, Facilities Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations; Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources. IHS Strategic Plan and how the Facilities programs are implementing: In consultation with Tribes and the Federal healthcare sites, IHS is allocating funding to the IHS Area Offices to complete BEMAR projects to make renovations and improvements necessary to support health care delivery in the health care facilities and to modernize the health care facilities and staff quarters to expand access to quality health care services. CJ - 249 FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2018 $8,500,000 2019 $8,500,000 2020 $9,100,000 2021 REQUEST The FY 2022 Quarters Return budget submission for Rent C ollections is $12 million , which is +$2 million above the FY 20 21 Enacted Level for anticipated rental collections. The IHS has increased the total number of quarters by about 6 percent since 2017, which is approximately 2 percent annually. In addition, the IHS updates rental rates for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) each year, per OMB Circular A -45. In FY 2020, the CP I was 3.5 percent. As a result of the growth in the total number of quarters, and increasing rental rates, the IHS collections were approximately $ 9 million in FY 2020, and anticipates collections of approximately $10 million in FY 2021. As a result, the FY 2022 IHS Budget includes anticipated collections of $12 million to address potential additional growth from FY 2021 to FY 2020. These funds support the following activities: The operation, management, and general maintenance of quarters, including maintenance personnel services, repairs to housing units and associated grounds, purchase of materials, supplies, and household appliances/equipment (e.g., stoves, water heaters, furnaces, etc.). OUTPUT S / OUTCOME S - This program measures outcomes throug h the inventory of staff quarters. Well -maintained and modern housing units are an essential element in recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals at IHS and Tribal healthcare sites. Rent collections, augmented with Maintenance & Improvement funding and collections where available, are used to maintain, repair, and modernize existing quarters. Typically work may include painting, carpeting, new appliances, roof replacement, etc. GRANT AWARDS - This program has no grant awards.

The 1988 amendments to the Act authorized Contract Support Costs (CSC) be paid in addition to the Secretarial amount. CSC are defined as necessary and reasonable costs for activities that T/TO must carry out to ensure compliance with the contract and prudent management but that the Secretary either did not normally carry out in his or her direct operation of the program or provided from resources other than those transferred under contract. The IHS CSC policy was established in 1992 and most recently revised on August 6, 2019, which updates from the October 2016 policy revisions,1 an update to reflect necessary changes. These changes inclu de the method by which Congress has funded CSC, and moves from limited to uncapped awards, and the provision of CSC to an indefinite appropriation. CSC is administered for IHS by the Office of Direct Services and Contracting Tribes (ODSCT), an office wit h responsibility for three primary functions that directly impact the relationship with each Indian T/TO. The ODSCT serves as the primary conduit between the IHS and the Direct Service Tribes, management of P.L. 93 -638 Title I, ISDEAA contracts, and CSC in support of both Title I contracts and Title V compacts. IHS Strategic Plan (SP) Goal 1, Objective 1.2, Building, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships; 1 Indian Health Manual , Part 6 - Services to Tribal Governments and Organizations, Chapter 3 - Contract Support Costs, available at http://www.ihs.gov/ihm/index.cfm?module=dsp_ihm_pc_p6c3 .

IHS developed a SharePoint to track CSC requirements for COVID -19 funds. S eparate data set are maintained for the period of funds availability for each Supplemental Appropriation. IHS SP Goal 1, Objective 1.2. IHS Headquarters reconciles CSC fund requests on a quarterly basis and allocates funds to each Area office to pay tribes. IHS SP Goal 3, Objective 3.2 IHS uses the CSC automated data system to track and monitor all CSC activity. The CSC data set is used to track all CSC funds, including any new and expanded assumption, renegotiation of CSC amounts, and distribution and payment of funds. IHS also uses the system to project CSC need based on the most current data. IHS SP Goal 3, Objective 3.3 - Modernize Information Technology and information systems to support data- driven decisions. IHS continues to use the internal electronic database to monitor each Title I and V ISDEAA negotiation, including CSC negotiations. The database monitors each phase of a negotiation to ensure that IHS uses a consistent agency business approach, meet statutory deadlines, and accurately calculate required funding amounts. In addition, the database tracks new and expanded assumptions and is used to determine the status of funds, workload, planning of resources, and subsequent years' funding needs. IHS SP Goal 3, Objective 3.3 IHS continues to make progress in resolving Contract Disputes Act claims from T/TO for additional CSC funding for prior years. As of August 17, 2020, the IHS has extended settlement offers on 1,567 of the 1,624 claims, with settlement payments of approximately $880 million that has been tentative or confirmed for payment from the Judgment Fund. IHS SP Goal 3, Objective 3.1 FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2018 $762,642, 000 2019 $822,227,000 2020 $820,000,000 2021 252BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2022 Budget submission for Contract Support Costs continues the indefinite discretionary appropriation established in FY 2016, with an estimated funding level of $1 billion , which is $226 million above the FY 2021 Enacted Level. Contract Support Costs General Increase: +$226 million for activities that T/TO must carry out to ensure compliance with the contract and prudent management, but that the Secretary either did not normally carry out in his or her direct operation of the program or provided from resources other than those transferred under contract The overall funding level varies with need that is adjust ed to meet the actual need for each fiscal year, which means that the appropriated amount wi ll continue to fluctuate until the CSC need is fully reconciled for each year . The requested funding level reflects IHS's best current estimate of the need. Contract Support Costs in FY 2023 The budget also proposes an advance appropriation for CSCs in FY 2023. In addition, the budget proposes that, beginning in FY 2023, that CSCs will continue to be funded through the Appropriations process but will be reclassified as mandatory funding. The FY 2023 Budget will include an updated score for FY 2023 CSC. In 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States established a new funding entitlement for Tribal contractors and compactors when they ruled in Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter that the Federal government is responsible for fully reimbursing actual contract support costs, regardless of the previous appropriations limit for this funding. In FY 2016, Congress provided an indefinite discretionary appropriation for contract support costs in the annual appropriations bill. An indefinite discretionary appropriation allows IHS to fund contract support costs at the actual total funding need for the fiscal year, aligning the budget to the Supreme Court's decision in Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter . Thi s funding mechanism avoids the need to redirect funding that IHS would otherwise use to provide direct services to Tribes . These costs are more appropriately funded from mandatory appropriations, consistent with other indefinite authorities.

Authorizing Legislation ................................................................................... 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324( l) Indian Self- Determination Assistance Act, P.L. 93- 638, as amended FY 20 Method .................................. P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contract and Compacts, Lease Cost Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act ( ISDEAA), at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324( l), also referred to as Section 105( l), requires the Indian Health Service (I HS) to enter a \"lease\" upon the request of a Tribe or Tribal Organization furnishing a tribally owned or leased facility used in support of its tribally operated ISDEAA contract or compact. IHS does not directly use or occupy the tribal facility under the lease. Through regulations contained in 25 C.F.R. Part 900, Subpart H, IHS identified elements of compensation included in a Section 105( l) lease. A 2016 Federal Court's decision (Maniilaq Association v. Burwell) prohibits IHS from capping funding under Section 105( l) at the level that IHS would have otherwise spent to operate a facility if it were to carrying out the Federal health programs. There is no statutory or regulatory limitation on when proposals may be submitted to the IHS, so IHS is unable to reliably predict or project annual costs. Lease costs have grown exponentially, since the Manii laq decision, and quadrupled between FY 2018 and FY 2019. Because IHS has not ha d sufficient dedicated funding for leases, IHS has been forced to reprogram funds twice in FY 2019 totaling $62 million and once in FY 2018 totaling $25 million. A funding incr ease in FY 2020 temporarily reduced the likelihood of reprogramming, but a bsent a change, IHS will continue to divert increasing amounts of resources from direct services to pay for leases. IHS cannot legally reduce the amount of funds provided to self-det ermination Tribes and tribal organizations, so the only funds available for reprogramming come from Tribes that IHS serves directly. The prevalence of Section 105( l) leases in FY 2017 was largely confined to the Alaska Area. However, by FY 2020, leases h ave proliferated throughout the IHS system and proposals have been received in 10 of 12 IHS Areas. This new, separate funding source supports IHS Strategic Plan goals and objectives for increasing access to care by establishing a dedicated funding source for these required costs and preventing CJ - 254the redirection of other IHS funds intended for health care services (Goal 1, Access, Objective 1.3, Increase access to quality health care services ). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS IHS has received 304 proposals in FY 2021 to date, with a current total of $128 million. This amount is likely to increase before the end of the fiscal year. At this funding level, costs are 21 times higher than in FY 2017. Based on the exponential growth of Section 105( l) leases from 37 proposals totaling $6 million in FY 2017, to 76 proposals totaling $21 million in FY 2018, to 189 proposals totaling $85 million in FY 2019, and 296 proposals totaling $123 million in FY 2020, costs for future years are expected to continue growing as more Tribes and Tribal Organizations submit additional proposals. In FY 2021, the IHS received an indefinite discretionary appropriation for section 105( l) leases, scored at $101 million. Funding for Village Built Clinics (VBCs) remains in the Hospitals and Health Clinics funding line. Unlike in prior years when section 105( l) lease costs were paid from the IHS lump sum appropriation for the Indian Health Services account, the IHS will not have to reallocate funding from other budget lines to address unanticipated lease proposals. The IHS conducted Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer in FY 2018 and again in FY 2019 on short-term and long-term options for meeting requirements of the ISDEAA related to Section 105( l). Tribal and Urban Indian Organization feedback strongly recommended seeking additional resources, such as through a separate indefinite appropriation, and remained critical of any redirection of existing funding, which diminishes the Indian health system's ability to provide direct health care services. At th e recommendation of Tribes and Tribal Organizations, the IHS established a technical subgroup to help collect and analyze information necessary for developing cost projections. The subgroup includes representatives from the IHS Tribal Self -Governance Advi sory Committee, the IHS Direct Services Tribes Advisory Committee, the IHS Facilities Appropriation Advisory Board, the IHS National Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup (NTBFW), and subject matter experts from the IHS. This subgroup operates under the aus pices of the NTBFW and their on -going work is included in the IHS's annual Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer on the budget. In accordance with FY 2021 appropriations language, IHS is working to finalize a planned approach for conducting Tribal Consult ation to establish a consistent and transparent process for payment of Section 105( l) leases. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2018 $0 2019 $0 REQUEST The FY 2022 budget submission for ISDEAA Section 105( l) leases is $150 million , which is $49 million above the FY 2021 Enacted l evel. Section 105( l) Lease Agreements in FY 2023 The budget also proposes an advance appropriation for ISDEAA Section 105( l) leases in FY 2023. In addition, the budget proposes that, beginning in FY 2023, that ISDEAA Section 105( l) lease will continue to be funded through the Appropriations process but will be reclassified as mandatory funding. In March 2016, the Maniilaq Association v. Burwell decision established a new funding entitlement for Tribal contractors and compactors as authorized by section 105( l) of the ISDEAA. The court ruled that the Secretary must compensate reasonable costs to each Tribe or Tribal organization who enters into a section 105( l) lease agreement. The court also prohibits IHS from capping funding under section 105( l) at the level that IHS would have otherwise spent to operate a facility if it were carrying out the health programs. In FY 2021, Congress enacted an indefinite discretionary appropriation to fully fund these costs. An indefinite discretionary appropriation allows IHS to fund section 105( l) lease agreements at the actual total funding need for the fiscal year, aligning the budget to the court decision s in Maniilaq Association v. Burwell . This funding mechanism avoids the need to redirect funding that IHS would otherwise use to provide direct services to Tribes . These costs are more appropriately funded from mandatory appropriations, consiste nt with other indefinite authorities. OUTPUTS / OUTCOMES -- There are no outputs/outcomes for this funding at this time. GRANTS AWARDS -- The program does not award grants. AREA ALLOCATION - Funds are allocated to Areas as ISDEAA Section 105( l) lease proposals are received and executed each fiscal year .

Expires September 30, 2023 Allocation Method ......................................................................................... Grants and Contracts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) grant program provides funding for diabetes treatment and prevention t o approximately 301 Indian Health Service (IHS) , Tribal , and Urban (I/T/U) Indian health grant programs. Funds for SDPI were first authorized in FY 1998; as such, FY 2022 would be the 25 th year of the SDPI . SDPI is currently authorized through September 30, 2023. The IHS Office of Clinical and Preventive Services (OCPS) Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) provides leadership, programmatic, administrative, and technical oversight to the SDPI grant program. CJ - 257The mission of the DDTP is to develop, document, and sustain public health efforts to prevent and control diabetes in American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) by promoting collaborative strategies through its extensive diabetes network . This mission aligns with Goal 1 of the IHS Strategic Plan , To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people and Objective 2.2 of the HHS Strategic Plan , Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities . The diabetes network consists of a national program office, Area Diabetes Consultants in each of the 12 IHS Areas, and approximately 301 S DPI grants and sub -grants at I/T/U sites across the country . Target Population: American Indians and Alaska Natives Diabetes and its complications are major contributors to death and disability in nearly every Tribal community. AI/AN adults have the highest age- adjusted rate of diagnosed diabetes (14.7 percent) among all racial and ethnic groups in the United States, more than twice the rate of the non-Hispanic white population (7.5 percent).1 In some AI/AN communities, more than half of adults 45 to 74 years of age have diagnosed diabetes, with preval ence rates reaching as high as 60 percent.2 Allocation Method In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress instructed the IHS to use SDPI funds to \"establish grants for the prevention and treatment of diabetes\" to address the growing problem of diabete s among AI/ANs. The entities eligible to receive these grants were I/T/Us . The IHS distributes this funding to approximately 301 I/T/U sites annually through a process that includes Tribal consultation/Urban confer , development of a formula for distribution of funds, and a formal grant application and administrative process. This process is consistent with IHS Strategic Plan Objective 1.2 to \"build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships \". Strategy The SDPI brings Tribes together to work toward a common purpose and share information and lessons learned. The Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee, established in 1998, reviews information on the SDPI progress and provides recommendations on diabetes- related issues to the IHS Director. Through partnerships with federal agencies, private organizations, and an extensive I/T/U network, DDTP undertook one of the most strategic diabetes treatment and prevention efforts ever attempted in AI/AN communities and demonstrated the ability to design, manage, and measure a complex, long -term project to address this chronic condition. Because of the significant costs associated with treating diabetes, I/T/Us have used best and promising practices for their local SDPI funding to address the primary, secondary , and tertiary prevention 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

These efforts increase the availability and accessibility of comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services to AI/AN people, which supports Goal 1 of the IHS Strategic Plan and Objective 1.3 of the HHS Strategic Plan. This collaborative approach supports the strategic planning process necessary to identify the goals and objectives needed to achieve the intended SDPI outcomes. As in Objectives 1.2, 1.3, and 3.1 of the IHS Strategic Plan, the SDPI promotes collaboration and communication with Tribes and Urban Indian Organizations in the development of quality community- based diabetes prevention and treatment programs. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS SDPI: T wo Major Components As directed by Congress and Tribal consultation, the SDPI consists of t wo major components: (1) SDPI Grant Program; and (2) Diabetes data and program delivery infrastructure. 1. SDPI Grant Program The SDPI grant program (formerly called the SDPI Community -Directed grant program) provides $138.7 million per year in grants and technical assistance for local diabetes treatment and prevention services at I/T/U health programs in 35 states. Each of the communities served by the SDPI grant program is unique in that its diabetes treatment and prevention needs and priorities are defined locally. Based on these local needs and priorities, the SDPI grant programs implement interventions to address the diabet es epidemic. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 established statutory authority for SDPI to implement a best practices approach to diabetes treatment and prevention. As such, t he SDPI has incorporated Indian Health Diabetes Best Practices into the SDPI g rant application process used throughout AI/AN communities. This effort is used to promote excellence and quality within the SDPI programs, which aligns with the IHS Strategic P lan Goal 2. Grant programs are required to document the use of one SDPI Diabetes Best Practice, 3 corresponding evaluation measures, and progress in achieving program objectives in order to enhance accountability. Grantees receive training on how to collect, evaluate, and improve their data collection and use it to improve their outcome results. Impact of the SDPI Grant Programs SDPI funding has enabled staff and programs at the local and national levels to increase access to diabetes treatment and prevention services throughout the Indian health system. The following table demonstrates substantial increases in access to many activities and services: 3 Available at https://www.ihs.gov/sdpi/sdpi- community -directed/diabetes -best-practices/ CJ - 259 Diabetes treatment and prevention services available to AI/AN individuals Access in 1997 Access in 2019 Absolute Percentage increase Diabetes clinical teams 30% 95% +65% Diabetes patient registered dieticians diabetes education materials Access to physical activity specialists Adult weight management services 19% 76% +57% Clinical Diabetes Outcomes during SDPI At the same time that access to these diabetes services increased, key outcome measures for AI/ANs with diabetes showed improvement or maintenance at or near national targets. These results have been sustained throughout the inception of SDPI. Examples include: Improving Blood Sugar Control Blood sugar control among AI/ANs with diabetes served by the IHS has improved over time. The average blood sugar level (as measured by the A1C test) decreased from 9.0 percent in 1996 to 8.0 percent in 2020 , nearing the A1C goal for most patients of less than 8 percent. Improving Blood Lipid Levels Average LDL cholesterol (i.e., \"bad\" cholesterol) declined from 118 mg/dL in 1998 to 89 mg/dL in 2020, surpassing the goal of less than 100 mg/dL. Reducing Kidney F ailure The rate of new cases of kidney failure due to diabetes leading to dialysis decline d by more than half (54 percent ) in AI/AN people from 1996 to 2013. This is a much larger decline than in any other racial group in the US. 4 2. Diabetes Data and Program Delivery Infrastructure The IHS has used funding from the SDPI to strengthen the diabetes data infrastructure of the Indian health system by improving diabetes surveillance and evaluation capabilities. The SDPI supports the development and implementation of the IHS Electronic Health Record, and the IHS Diabetes Management System in all 12 IHS Areas, which supports Objective 3.3 of the IHS Strategic Plan . Facilities associated with SDPI programs participate in the annual IHS Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit. The Diabetes Audit is the cornerstone of the IHS DDTP diabetes care surveillance system, tracking annual performance on diabetes care and health outcome measures. Data collection for the Diabetes Audit follows a standardized protocol to ensure statistical integrity and compa rability of measures over time. The 20 20 Diabetes Audit included a review of 130,542 patient charts at 3 25 I/T/U health facilities. The Diabetes Audit enables IHS and the SDPI programs to monitor and evaluate yearly performance at the local, regional, an d national 4 Bullock A, Burrows NR, Narva AS, et al. Vital Signs: Decrease in Incidence of Diabetes -Related End -Stage Renal Disease among American Indians/Alaska Natives \u2014 United States, well as enhance quality improvement capabilities across AI/AN communities. These innovative efforts align with Objective 2.1 of the IHS Strategic Plan . DDTP provides D iabetes Audit training through online and webinar formats. DDTP receives evaluations on all trainings provided to guide improvements for future sessions. Key Performance/Accomplishments Annual SDPI assessments have shown significant improvements in the availability of diabetes clinical care and community services provided over time when compared to the baseline SDPI assessment in 1997 (see table above titled \"Diabetes treatment and prevention services available to AI/AN individuals\"). Ongoing efforts to improve blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol values will continue to reduce the risk for microvascular, as well as macrovascular complications (see \"Outputs/Outcomes \" table below). Reporting In addition to internal monitoring of the SDPI Grant Program, the DDTP has completed six SDPI Reports to Congress to document the progress made since 1997. The SDPI Reports to Congress are as follows: January 2000 Interim Report to Congress on SDPI; December 2004 Interim Report to Congress on SDPI; 2007 SD PI Report to Congress: On the Path To A Healthier Future ; 2011 SDPI Report to Congress: Making Progress Toward A Healthier Future ; 2014 SDPI Report to Congress : Changing the Course of Diabetes: Turning Hope into Reality ; and 2020 SDPI Report to Congress: Changing the Course of Dia betes: Charting Remarkable Progress.

Advance appropriations provide additional stability to programs funded through the annual appropriations process. U nlike th e Veteran's Health Administration, which receives advance appropriations, a nd Medicare and Medicaid, which receive significant mandatory funding, at present, IHS receives the majority of its funding through the annual appropriations process which has complicated its delivery of services under continuing resolutions and during lapses in appropriations. In September 2018, the Government Accountability Office published their report GAO-18- 652, Indian Health Service: Considerations Related to Providing Advance Appropriation Authority1. In this study, the GAO highlighte d the effects of budg etary uncertainty - Continuing Resolutions and lapses in appropriations - on healt h care programs and operations. The GAO highlighted negative impacts of budgetary uncertainty on provider recruitment and retention, administrative burden and costs, and financial effects on t ribes. In December 2018, appropriations for the IHS lapsed as part of the longest government shutdow n in United States history. Under a government shutdow n, IHS- operated h ealth care operations are deemed \"excepted\" activities to protect life and property, and continue in the absence of funding. During the 35- day shutdow n, the IHS took extraordinary steps t o redirect carryover funding and third- party revenues to cover additional costs, including pay for health care professionals providing direct he alth c are services, to the extent possible. However, the IHS was unable to provide funding to Tribally-operate d and Urban Indian Health programs, including Tribally-o perated health programs that receiv e fund ing each Janu ary on a calendar-y ear payment cycle. Tribal and Urban Indian heal th programs are vulnerable to serious impacts fro m a lapse in appro priations. Many are unable to draw on reserves, or have little third-party revenue to rely on to maintain health care operations. In addition, a lapse in appropriations of the unprecedented duration experience d in FY 2019 made it all the more difficult for Tribes and Urban India n health programs to maintain operations. As a result, programs reduced their hours, days or types of services , furloughed staff, faced staff resignations fr om hard-to-recruit po sitions, and as well as other impacts on p atient ca re. After the FY 2019 government shutdow n, Tribal and Urban Indian Organization Leaders renewed their calls for Advance Appropriations for the IHS. The FY 2022 and FY 2023 Tribal Budg et Recommendations include a request for advance appropriations for the IHS. 1 https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694625.pdf CJ - 265 Continuing resolutions also pose operational challenges for IHS, Tribally operated Health programs and Urban Indian Health programs. IHS has received full-year appropriations at the start of the fiscal year only once since 1997. Continuing resolutions can inhibit health programs' ability to make up -front purchases of medication and equipment, harm relationships with vendors due to funding unpredictability, and even result in higher costs on commercial loans. IHS, Tribal and Urban Indian Health programs are faced with difficult decisions in the absence of a timely federal appropriation, including whether to reduce the level of care they provide to American Indian/Alaska Native patients . Advance Appropriations will support stable, reliable, and predictable resources for IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs, providing the IHS parity with other federal direct health service providers. BUDGET REQUEST The IHS Advance Ap propriation Request for FY 2023 is $9 billion, an increase of +$500 million above the FY 2022 President's Budget. These funds would become available on October 1, 2022, and would therefore score as an FY 2023 cost. The FY 2023 request allows for an incre ase of: Current Services (+$207 million) : Current Services funding offsets the rising cost of providing direct health care services, including tribal and federal pay costs, medical and non -medical inflation, and population growth. These resources help the IHS to maintain services at the prior year level by shoring up operating budgets of IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs. For the FY 2023 Advance Appropriations estimate, the IHS uses the most recently available data that was also used to deter mine the FY 2022 President's Budget Current Service request. o Pay Costs $96.2 million - to fund pay increases for federal and Tribal employees, of whom approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing direct health care and related services. o Inflation $24.2 million - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. o Population Growth $86.7 million - to fund the additional service needs arising from the growing AI/AN population. The projected growth rate for FY 2023 is 1.8 percent, based on data used to calculate the growth rate for the FY 2022 President's Budget request. Staffing for New Facilities (+$39 million) : These resources will support personnel and operating costs at eight new or exp anded health care facilities, which will expand the availabili ty of direct health care services for American Indian and Alaska Native Communities. Consistent with the approach taken in the FY 2022 President's Budget and prior years, IHS only requests funding for the portion of FY 2023 in which a facility will reach beneficial occupancy status. New Facilities Amount FTE/Tribal Positions Naytahwaush Health Center (JV), Naytahwaush, MN (Salt River) Health Center, Scottsdale, AZ $10,030,000 73 Phoenix Indian Medical Center Central, Phoenix, AZ $451,000 6 Ysleta Del Sur Health Center (JV), El Paso, TX $1,304,000 10 Alternative Rural Clinic (JV), New Town, ND $2,625,000 22 CJ - 266 North Start Health Clinic (JV), Seward, AK $3,500,000 20 General Services Account Program Increase (+$254 million) : The funding request for FY 2023 Advance Appropriations also includes an unallocated general program increase within the Services account . The IHS looks forward to working with Tribal and Urban Indian Organization Leaders and Congress to identify the highest priority uses for these funds.

These funds have not yet been allocated, but the IHS anticipates a portion of the $420 million will support drug control activities. CJ - 270 MISSION The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for providing Federal health services to American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people . IHS supports substance abuse treatment and prevention services as part of this mission. METHODOLOGY The IHS includes the appropriation for Alcohol and Substance Abuse (excluding the amount designated as Adult Alcohol Treatment) and the portion of Urban Indian Health funds that partially come from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism programs transferred to the IHS under the U rban Indian Health budget. BUDGET SUMMARY In FY 2022, IHS requests $142.0 million for its drug control activities , a $6.7 million increase above the FY 2021 Enacted level . Alcohol and Substance Abuse FY 20 22 Request : $138.4 million In FY 2022, the IHS budget request for its drug control activities supports the O ffice of National Drug Control and P olicy (ONDCP) funding priorities as well as the ONDCP Strategy . The Strategy emphasizes the partnership between Federal agencies and their state, lo cal, tribal, and international counterparts and reduce drug-induced mortality. IHS is also working with Federal partners to implement ONDCP's efforts to address the current opioid crisis and reduce the number of American's dying from dangerous drugs. The Administration's ONDCP Strategy guides and expands Federal government efforts to reduce the size of the drug -using population through 1) prevention and education, 2) increasing access to treatment services for those suffering from substance use disorder , and 3) reducing the availability of dangerous drugs. The Strategy offers a valuable opportunity for IHS to advance its mission by strengthening existing programs to control and reduce substance use and eliminate its deleterious effects on the health and safety of AI/AN patients and communities. The IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse program serves AI/ANs impacted by substance use disorders through IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian operated treatment and prevention programs and Youth Regional Treatment Center s (YRTCs). The IHS established a multi-disciplinary workgroup to form the IHS National Committee on Heroin, Opioids, and Pain Efforts (HOPE). The HOPE Committee is comprised of a multidisciplinary membership to include clinical representation from family medicine, pharmacy, behavioral health, nursing, pediatrics, physical therapy, epidemiology, and injury prevention. The HOPE Committee work plan supports the HHS 5- Point Strategy to Combat the Opioid Crisis with a specific focus on 1) better pain manag ement; 2) improving access to culturally relevant prevention, treatment, and recovery support services; 3) increasing availability and distribution of opioid overdose reversing drugs; and 4) improved public health data reporting and surveillance. In addition to direct services, the IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse grant and federal award program supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 to provide care to better meet the CJ - 271 health care needs of AI/AN communities and Goal 1 to ensure comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people. Particularly , in the prevention, treatment and recovery of alcohol and substance use disorders. The IHS Division of Behavioral Health admin isters community -based grants that promote the use and development of evidence- based and practice- based models that represent culturally - appropriate prevention and treatment approaches to substance mis use from a community-driven context. In particular, the IHS Opioid Grant Program and the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention program will support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2 to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships and Objective 1.3 to increase access to quality health care services. IHS Opioid Grant Program: In FY 2021, IHS awarded a total of $16 Million in grants to combat the opioid crisis. IHS awarded thirty -five grants under the Community Opioid Intervention Pilot Project (COIPP) for AI/ANs targeted at opioid specific activities. This grant initiative ha s three objectives, 1) to increase public awareness and education about culturally -appropriate and family -centered opioid prevention, treatment and recovery practices and programs 2) creating comprehensive support teams to strengthen and empower AI/AN families, and finally 3) reducing the unmet treatment needs and opioid overdose related deaths through the use of Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT ). Eva luation of the COIPP initiative will promote the documentation, and sharing of locally -designed, culturally- appropriate prevention, treatment, recovery, and aftercare services for opioid use disorders in AI/AN communities. The IHS COIPP is a three year program and part of the Department of Health and Human Services' five- point strategy to fight the opioid overdose epidemic in Ameri ca. IHS Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention (SASP) : The SASP is a nationally -coordinated grant program (formerly referred to as the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative (MSPI)) which focus es on substance abuse and suicide prevention providing intervention resources targeted to Tribes, Tribal programs, and Urban Indian communities with the greatest need for these programs. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of the 174 SASP projects reduced and/or ceased activities. Only a limited number of projects continued to operate and did so according to their local, state, and federal guidelines for COVID -19 by modifying in-person activities to v irtual events. In June 2020, the IHS requested and received a 1- year extension for all SASP grants from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) due to the impact of COVID -19. The new end date for all SASP grants will be September 29, 2021. Of the projects funded, 19 projects specifically focus on substance use prevention, treatment, and aftercare, while 107 focus on substance use and suicide prevention among Native youth. IHS established the Universal Alcohol Screening (UAS) as a national measure to increase screening and improve detection and intervention strategies among patients' ages 9 through 75 years of age. In FY 2020, 37.1 percent of eligible patients were screened for risky alcohol use, which is less than the IHS target of 42.4 percent. All projects funded have a training objective to increase and expand the types of healthcare providers trained in SUD screening, assessment or treatment, including Brief Intervention and Motivational Interviewing. Projects also seek to hire additio nal behavioral health staff (i.e., licensed behavioral health providers and paraprofessionals, including but not limited to peer specialists, mental health technicians, and community health aides) specializing in child, adolescent, and family services. These new staff will be responsible for implementing project activities that address all of the required objectives listed. CJ - 272 Successful outcomes during the fourth year of the program include expanded behavioral health services offered through school settings and home visiting with a total of 1,475 patients receiving care. Over 270 providers were trained in behavioral health integration with 163 of those providers located within a primary care setting. Project accomplishments include 67,168 individuals screen for suicide ideation, 54 percent of the SASP program suicide prevention projects implemented an enhanced process for suicide screening, and over 11,003 community members have been trained in suicide and/or substance use prevention. Fifty three percent of p rojects hosted a successful prevention education community event. Twenty nine percent reported implementation and documentation of a system change. In addition, among projects supported, a total of 76,054 individuals received cultural services, a high perc entage of projects have continued to offer integrated traditional healing into care, extended service hours, provision of follow-up care, new counseling and case management services. In summary, the SASP program continues to support tribes, tribal organiza tions, urban Indian organizations (UIOs) , and federal facilities offering care. Preventing Alcohol -Related Deaths (PARD): In the 2017 Senate Appropriations Committee Report 114-281, the Committee directed IHS to \"allocate $2,000,000 of the increase provided for the alcohol and substance abuse program to fund essential detoxification and related services.\" Specifically, in the report the number of alcohol related deaths in the community of Gallup, New Mexico was addressed with the report stating, \"these deaths underscore the urgent need for substance abuse treatment, residential services and detoxification services\" in this community. In response, the IHS used the increased appropriated funds to address the urgent need in the city of Gallup, New Mexico. In addition to Gallup, New Mexico, IHS was aware of the urgent need for alcohol detoxification services in the Great Plains Area after the removal of liquor licenses and alcohol sales in White Clay, Nebraska , leading to the potential for increased mortality if services were unavailable for alcohol detoxification. As a result, funds were also made available to address this urgent need. The funds provided to Gallup, New Mexico and the Great Plains Area (speci fically the Oglala Sioux Tribe) to address the need for social detox ification services were made available in FY 2017 through a competitive cooperative agreement. The funding announcement was released in FY 2017 and two projects were selected and funded. The project period is for five years and will run from September 15, 2017, to September 14, 2022. With the additional funding, the Gallup NM site reported detoxification services to 9,482 unique individuals with over 75 percent of those clients including males. In addition to services offered for monitoring, supervising and managing detoxification, this site has increased coordination and transportation with the Emergency Department; and establish ed a contract with the Gallup Police Department to transpo rt patients to the detoxification center. The Great Plains' site has used the funding to increase coordination with behavioral health programs, provide screenings and brief interventions to individuals incarcerated in jails, and serve as an immediate placement for individuals who are in need of treatment services following detoxification. In FY 2020, nearly 100 percent of individuals held in detoxification for more than two weeks were successfully admitted into a higher level of residential treatment care for their SUD. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic , services were temporarily interrupted at the City of Gallup detoxification site and the PARD site in the Great Plains Area . Services were temporarily disrupted due to tribal ordinances enforcing lock downs and closures of tribal operations. Operations have since resumed and IHS continues to work with both sites to ensure each has adopted guidelines provided by the local and state health departments, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Youth Regional Treatment Centers: The IHS YRTCs provide residential substance abuse and mental health treatment services to AI/AN youth. Congress established these YRTCs in each of the 12 IHS Areas, with two (northern and southern) specifically authorized for the California CJ - 273 Area. The YRTC in Northern California is expected to be operational in early 2021. The 12 currently funded YRTCs provide quality holistic behavioral health care for AI/AN adolescents that integrate traditional healing, spiritual values , and cultural identification. In FY 2020, all federal YRTCs in operation 18 months or longer have achieved and maintained accreditation status. YRTC Aftercare Pilot Project : Two YRTC facilities, Desert Sage and the Healing Lodge of the 7 Nations are in th e last year of an IHS supported aftercare pilot project. YRTCs have an important role in maintaining the health of patients after discharge. This a ftercare pilot emphasi zed developing culture- based treatment that prevent s alcohol and substance abuse relapse among youth discharged. While evaluations are in place, current data indicates that these programs have resulted in improved coordination around aftercare and case management, increased training of community supports f or the adolescents, improved identification of transitional living, increased awareness of the use of social media, and improved follow-up with data collection after discharge. This pilot program will continue to support the YRTC's ability to support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 to ensure comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people. Particularly, in the recovery from alcohol and substance use disorders. The strategic goal is to support Tribal programs and U IOs in their continued substance abuse prevention, treatment, and infrastructure development. These efforts represent an innovative partnership with IHS to deliver services developed by the communit ies themselves, with a national support network for ongoing program development and evaluation. Substance use disorders continue to rank high on the concern list of Tribal partners. IHS believes that a shift in emphasis to earlier intervention is required to be successful in reducing the consequences of substance use disorders. IHS proposes focusing on early intervention with adolescents and young adults and preventing further progression by recognizing and responding to the source of the abuse. IHS co ntinues to support the integration of substance use disorder treatment into primary care and emergency services through its activities to implement the Strategy . Integrating treatment services into outpatient primary care offers opportunities for healthcare providers to identify patients with substance use disorders, provide them with medical advice, help them understand the health risks and consequences, and refer patients with more severe substance use- related problems to treatment. 1 One integra tion activity is Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), which is an early intervention and treatment service for people with substance use disorders and those at risk of developing these disorders. IHS has increased efforts to implement the SBIRT across IHS facilities as an evidence- based practice to identify patients with alcohol related problems. The SBIRT is a Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) measure that IHS reports annually. In FY 20 20, the SBIRT was administered at 12.8 percent for AI/AN ages 9 -75, exceeding the targ et of 12.2 percent screened . IHS promotes the use of this clinical process by training providers in clinical and community settings. IHS currently offers 10 SBIRT on- deman d trainings. SBIRT is intended to meet the public health goal of reducing the harms and societal costs associated with risky use by reducing diseases, accidents, and injuries. As an additional resource, IHS developed an Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program webpage: https://www.ihs.gov/asap/providers/sbirt/ . 1 ONDCP. Integrating Treatment into Healthcare. Available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/integrating- treatment -and- healthcare. CJ - 274 The IHS requires all prescribers to conduct a full patient m edical history and physical examination including review of the patient's current psychosocial status, any history of mental health or substance abuse concerns, and assessment for relevant signs of misuse or abuse of substances. Examination is done at the time of consideration of use of chronic opioid therapy and periodically during a ctive pain management treatment. Patient screening surveys and urine drug tests are helpful in determining the risk of opioid misuse and guiding the frequency of ongoing monitoring. Screening surveys are incorporated into the triage/nurse screening proce ss prior to seeing the clinician. IHS developed a Pain Management website: https://www.ihs.gov/painmanagement/substancescreening/ . Patients treated for substance use disorder s often present with a need to address co-occurring mental disorders. In FY 2017, the IHS Division of Behavioral Health awarded 12 new grantees through the Behavioral Health Integration Initiative (BH2I) , a nationally-coordinated grant program that provides funding to Tribes, Tribal organizations, UIOs and federal facilities to plan, develop, implement and evaluate behavioral health integration with primary care. In FY 2020, IHS continued funding for 12 IHS, tribal, and UIOs to integrate behavioral health with primary care services in their local health facilities. A primary goal of the BH2I is to formalize integration across the system, develop care teams, strengthen infrastructure, and enhance clinical processes including increased depression screenings in primary care clinics. Additionally, IHS contracted with a technical assistance (TA) provider to guide this pilot project through the implementation of their integrated care efforts with expertise from psychiatrists, primary care physicians, and social workers. Thus far, BH2I projects have reported successes such as new behavioral health integration policies and procedures including same day access to behavioral health providers within primary care and emergency room settings. Sites have also reported increased screening rates for depression, anxiety, trauma and early childhood development disabilities and reduction in wait times to see a mental health counselor and psychiatrist. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, in FY 2020 IHS provided an additiona l year for all BH2I grantees . This final year will allow flexibility in the project period to complete proposed activities with a focus on meeting the needs of the community as well as developing sustainability plans for their work. In FY 2021, IHS will a ward approximately 15 new BH2I grantees, which will be on a five- year funding cycle through FY 2026. Additionally, IHS will contract with a technical assistance provider to support grantees with the implementation of integrated care efforts. Reducing the Number of Drug Overdose Deaths: Increasing Access to MAT Services : In June 2019, IHS released the Special General Memorandum Assuring Access to MAT that requires Federal IHS Facilities to create an action plan to identify or create local medication assisted treatment resources and coordinate patient access to these services when indicated. Key components of these approaches include enhanced screening and early identification of Opioid Use Disorders; improved care coordination and patient referral for treatment; and workforce development strategies to increase education and resources surrounding using medications in the support of recovery. The IHS has expanded access to harm reduction interventions that include increased access to the opioid overdose reversal medication, naloxone. Since 2015, the IHS has maintained an ongoing collaboration with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to train and provide naloxone to BIA Law Enforcement Officers (LEO) for responding to opioid overdoses. These initial effo rts have evolved into a robust harm reduction strategy that includes a combination of policy and CJ - 275 workforce development efforts. In March 2018, the IHS implemented a policy in the Indian Health Manual (Chapter 35) entitled Prescribing and Dispensing of Nal oxone to First Responders to require IHS Federal pharmacies to provide naloxone to Tribal law enforcement agencies and other trained first responders. A revision to Chapter 35 was released in 2020 to further expand first responder definitions to community members and to reduce administrative reporting requirements related to requests for resupply. The IHS has also created a naloxone toolkit for tribal communities that includes a culturally responsive training video and a digital story from two LEOs involv ed in a naloxone 'save'. This toolkit also contains a train the trainer curriculum and standardized forms to support first responder initiatives. The IHS has also created sample protocols and pharmacist collaborative practice agreements to expand access to co -prescribed naloxone for patients on long-term opioid therapy or at increased risk for opioid overdose. In November 2019, the IHS developed and released a health education video that shared best and promising practices surrounding naloxone distribution and the way IHS and the Red Lake Nation are responding to the opioid crisis. A companion video was released in August 2020 that shares basic information related to opioids, naloxone, treatment and prevention. The IHS has further adapted the toolkit and strategy to equip community first responders and paraprofessionals with training on opioid overdose response and naloxone. These expanded collaborations with local law enforcement and community first responders resulted in an initial pilot community -health naloxone train-the-trainer program to include naloxone distribution. In FY 2018, buprenorphine and suboxone were added to the IHS Core Formulary. Buprenorphine and suboxone are common medications used to treat opioid use disorder. With these added to the Core Formulary, all IHS facilities with pharmacies have these medications readily available for their patients. Data related to buprenorphine and suboxone will be captured in reporting tools that will suppo rt regional -level efforts to better monitor MAT and SUD treatment across IHS. The IHS does face challenges in providing MAT in certain sectors within Indian Country. The rural and frontier nature of where American Indians/Alaska Natives live creates barriers to accessing health facilities. This is especially evident in Alaska where patients often only have access to a community health aide serving within a village -based clinic, hours away by plane from a larger health center. Additionally, IHS has felt the impact of a declining supply of specific health professionals who could support the IHS workforce and address behavioral health needs. The IHS recognizes that telemedicine is one tool for increasing access to specialized medical services, such as MAT. The IHS has published a policy in the Indian Health Manual (Chapter 38) entitled Internet Eligible Controlled Substance Prescriber Designation to assure access to MAT using telemedicine models for remotely located Tribal members. In December 2019, the IHS processed the first tribal clinician application to receive this designation. In August 2019, ninety -six community-health workers completed training as naloxone trainers for their tribal communities in one week. Increase Mandatory Prescriber Education and Continuing Training on Best Practices and Current Clinical G uidelines: The IHS implemented the \"Chronic Non- Cancer Pain Management Policy\" to promote appropriate pain management as a primary prevention tool. In February 2018, IHS released a revised policy to include clinical practice guidelines contained in the 2016 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain . This revised policy adopts CDC guidance and specifically requires IHS sites to establish and implement local chronic no n-cancer pain protocols and procedures; requires prescribers to complete training on appropriate and effective use of CJ - 276 controlled substance medications; and establishes the requirement to initiate opioid treatment as a shared decision between the prescriber and the patient to respect and support the patient's right to optimal pain assessment and management. In May 2019, the IHS released its \"Recommendations for Management of Acute Dental Pain\" for prescribing opioids for acute pain secondary to common general dentistry conditions and procedures. These g uideline limit opioid prescribing for patients who cannot safely use alternative pain medication. The guidelines also include a decision tree for pre - and post- operative pain management, as well as recommended dosage limits for analgesics based on the degree of anticipated operative pain. The IHS collaborated to create content for a five- part CEU webinar series to influence dental prescribing practices and enhance screening for substance use disorders in general dentistry. The IHS has also implemented IHM Chapter 32 \"State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs\" that establishes policy requirement for Federal facilities to participate with state -based Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP). Controlled substance prescribers working in IHS federal -government -operated must query state PDMP databases prior to prescribing opioids for pain treatment longer than seven days and periodically throughout chronic pain treatment. I n FY 2019, IHS developed and released software programming to automate controlled substance dispensing reports to state- based PDMPs to near real -time reporting to improve the fidelity of IHS dispensing data in st ate PDMP databases. The IHS has been in preliminary planning and design discussions to evaluate feasibility of PDMP interoperability and integration into the IHS Electronic Health Record. These efforts support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.3 Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions. In March 2019, the IHS released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on American Indian/Alaska Native Pregnant Women and Women of Childbearing Age with Opioid Use Disorder developed in collaboration with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) Committee on American Indian and Alaska Native Women's Health. This resource will help providers improve maternal participation in early prenatal care, improve screening for substance use disorder, and increase access to MAT for pregnant women and women of child- bearing age. The goal of these clinical recommendations is to foster relationships and improve awareness surrounding trauma-informed approaches to maternal opioid use that may lead to recovery, hope, and healing. Additionally, the IHS and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Native American Child Health (CONACH) recently released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome that includes clinical recommendations on the prevention and management of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. These recommendations provide standards of care for screening, diagnosing, support, and treatment of pregnant mothers and infants affected by prenatal opioid exposure. In August 2019, the IHS developed and released two additional Clinical Reporting System measures to track implementation of the ACOG recommendations and substance use disorder screen ing in women of childbearing age. Proper Pain Management and Opioid Stewardship Training: The IHS has created and released a comprehensive Opioid Stewardship workbook to assist sites with creating best practices surrounding safe opioid prescribing reco mmendations and increasing access to integrative pain treatments. The workbook emphasizes utilizing opioid surveillance strategies to evaluate population health outcomes, target opioid interventions, enhance clinical decision support, and create professional practice evaluation strategies. In August 2019, the IHS CJ - 277 developed data definitions to support creation of an opioid prescribing surveillance dashboard that will assist with the analysis of opioid -related data on national and regional levels. The IHS opioid stewardship program evaluation considers metrics that evaluate trends in Morphine Milligram Equivalents versus a restricted focus on total opioid prescription fills , include analysis of risk reduction strategies with co -prescribed naloxone, and monitor patient conversion to chronic opioid therapy . These efforts support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.3 Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions . The IHS has also recently facilitated dedicated access to tele- consultation services for IHS clinicians to receive on -demand substance use expert recommend ations and tailored clinical guidance for IHS healthcare providers of all experience levels. This service is also av ailable to assist IHS health systems with creating clinic policies and procedures to support creation of integrated MAT services in IHS facilities. In May 2016, the IHS implemented a policy on mandatory opioid training requiring all federally controlled substance prescriber s to complete the \"IHS Essential Training on Pain and Addiction\" with required refresher training every 3 years. This training is now available on demand with continuing education credits. The IHS released its Refresher training course in January 2018, including four sessions of its mandatory five-hour training course for providers on proper opioid prescribing. In FY 2020, 355 participants completed this course. The mandate also includes an additional refresher training after three years. In FY 20 20, 289 participants completed the Essential Training on Pain and Addiction Refresher course. This course will be updated in FY 2021. The IHS has also created a robust workforce development strategy to include didactic training. In September 2019, the IHS launched its Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder Continuing Medical Education series. The IHS has hosted learning sessions in this series that include buprenorphine prescribing in pregnancy as well as a live instructor-led auricular acupuncture-training pr ogram, implementation of MAT programs, management of co -occurring disorders, and initiating Buprenorphine in the acute care setting. Future session include an intensive training program related to the management of substance use disorders for advanced practice pharmacists and add itional content surrounding integrated MAT models. In FY 2020, IHS provided three webinars that addressed pain management and opioids, and opioid misuse with a total of 326 attendees. Implementing an Integrated MAT Model - A Review of Resources Assessment and Treatment of Pain and Co -Occurring Opioid Use Disorder in Individuals with Serious Mental Illness. Treatment of OUD in the ED, Should it be a Choice? In FY 2020, IHS provided three on-demand . Prenatal on the and Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome. Prenatal Opioid Exposure: Effects in Early Childhood Prenatal Opioid Exposure: Interventions Enhanced communication during the opioid crisis response is vital to program development, policy implementation, and ongoing evaluation. The IHS created an Opioid Information Sheet CJ - 278 that serve s as a public- facing logic model to share opioid -related measure, agency goals, and available resources for both clinicians and tribal stakeholders. The IHS opioid strategy and a host of available resources is housed on two IHS webpages that support a unif ied user experience in addition to publication of a quarterly opioid newsletter. The IHS collaborated in FY 2018 with the CDC to participate in the CDC Opioid Quality Improvement Collaborative to implement five opioid quality improvement measures at four IHS sites. Communication to employees and stakeholders involving best and promising practices and resources addressing pain management and addiction is achieved through our expanded internet presence. The IHS released a combined website for opioids in FY 2018 located at : www.ihs.gov/opioids . In August 2020, the IHS released new clinical decision support tools for RPMS to assist providers in meeting documentation standards outlined in IHM, Part 3 - Chapter 30. The EHR reminders and dialogue note templates facilitate accurate and timely documentation to support patient care and the pain management policy. The tools also address OIG findings from a recent IHS prescribing review. Increase Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) Interoperability and U sage: The IHS is working to improve public health data surveillance and reporting and has developed a data reporting system that will provide prescribing and diagnosis data on national and regional levels. This will enable IHS to track emerging trends, evaluate changes in prescribing practices, monitor overdose rates and emergency department utilization, and assess changes with access to MAT. The IHS will evaluate expanded partnerships and data- related resources with other Federal partners and Tribal Epidemiology Centers in FY 2019. These reporting and surveillance tools will strengthen IHS program management and operations by improving communication within the organization with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.1 Improve communication within the organization, Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public . Finally, in 2019 his hosted the National Combined Councils Meeting (NCC) , an agency wide meeting which provides opportunities for multidisciplinary collaboration focusing on the clinical and administrative needs of the agency. In addition, this meeting offers an opportunity to provide continuing education trainings for healthcare providers, and previous session topics included: 1) Addressing the Opioid Crisis in Indian Country, 2) Exploring Best Practices in Chronic Pain Management, and 3) Evaluating Options for Creating and Sustaining Integrated Primary Care MAT Models. IHS also provided a 4.25 hour training, titled \"Prescriber Data Waiver Training.\" This training session assisted participants with meeting the SAMHSA and DEA requirements to apply for a DATA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disor der. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 NCC was cancelled however IHS will resume NCC meetings and activities in FY 2021. Reducing Availability of Illicit and Dangerous Drugs: The IHS supports the safe and effective disposal of unused pharmaceuticals at the enterprise level through the provision of reverse distributor services at Federal pharmacies for unopened expired controlled substances. The agency has participated in interagency efforts to support proper collection and disposal of pain medications. CJ - 279 I/T/U pharmacies have continued to enroll as DEA collectors and to participate in prescription drug disposal efforts. IHS collaborated with the State of North Dakota to achieve 100 percent of IHS sites in the state (both Federal and Tribal) to b e registered as DEA collectors. In FY 2019, the IHS expanded patient level disposal through the addition of 29 Federal Pharmacy sites as registered DEA controlled substance collectors. This included funding for supplies and technical assistance with DEA requirements. On the IHS pain management website, IHS provides resources for tribal and urban Indian communities on Take -Back Event, Permanent Collection Sites, Mail -Back Programs and Environmentally Safe Options from Home. The website also has two sessi ons focused on safe storage of medications and medication disposal for providers on proper opioid disposal. https://www.ihs.gov/painmanagement/disposal/patientdisposal/ Urban Indi an Health Program - Alcohol and Substance Abuse Title V Grants FY 20 22 Request: $ 3.6 million The 41 UIOs are an integral part of the Indian health care system and serve as resources to both tribal and urban communities. Urban Indians are often invisible in the urban setting and face unique challeng es when accessing healthcare. A large proportion of Urban Indians live in or near poverty and face multiple barriers such as the lack of quality and culturally relevant health care services in cities. UIOs ar e an important support to Urban Indians seeking to maintain their tribal values and cultures and serve as a safety net for our urban patients. UIO s that offer inpatient and outpatient substance use disorder treatment have become reliable referral sites fo r Tribes and Urban Indians. In FY 2022, IHS is proposing $3.6 million for the urban ONDCP budget. AI/AN people who live in urban centers present a unique morbidity and mortality profile. Urban AI/AN populations suffer disproportionately higher mortality from certain causes in sharp contrast to mainstream society. These unique challenges require a targeted response. Existing UIOs see their efforts in health education, health promotion, and disease prevention as essential to impacting the behavioral cont ributors to poor health 2: Alcohol-induced death rates are 2.8 times greater for urban AI/AN people than urban all races. Chronic liver disease death rates are 2.1 times greater for urban AI/AN people than urban all races. Accidents and external causes of death rates are 1.4 times greater for urban AI/AN people than urban all races. Alcohol and drug -related deaths continue to plague urban AI/AN people. Alcohol-induced mortality rates for urban AI/AN people are markedly higher than for urban all races. Al l regions, with the exception of eastern seaboard cities in the Nashville Area, show dramatically higher rates for urban AI/AN people than for urban all races who live in the same communities: the Billings Area is 4 times greater, the Phoenix Area is 6 times greater, the Tucson Area is 6.7 times greater, and the Great Plains Area has a 13.4 times greater alcohol-induced rate of mortality. 3 Urban AI/AN populations are more likely to engage in health risk behaviors. Urban AI/AN people are more likely to rep ort heavy or binge drinking than all-race populations and urban 2 Indian Health Service, Report to Congress: New Needs Assessment of the Urban Indian Health Program and the Communities it Services at 10 (Mar. 31, 2016) (hereinafter New Needs Assessment), available at https://www.ihs.gov/urban/includes/themes/newihstheme/display_objects/documents/ReportToCongressUrbanNeedsAssessment.pdf. 3 Ibid. CJ - 280 AI/AN people are 1.7 times more likely to smoke cigarettes. Urban AI/AN people more often view themselves in poor or only fair health status, with 22.6 percent reporting fair/poor health as compared to 14.7 percent of all races reporting as fair/poor. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is a term used to describe a range of effects that can occur in someone whose mother consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders include disorders such as fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol -related neuro developmental disorder, and alcohol-related birth defects. Interventions are needed in urban centers to address prevention efforts for urban AI/AN people with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder s. The IHS policy that requires the IHS to confer with UIOs \"to develop and implement culturally sensitive assessment and diagnostic tools including dysmorphology clinics and multidisciplinary fetal alcohol spectrum disorders clinics for use in Indian communities and urban centers.\" Heavy drinking during pregnancy can cause significant birth defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading and most preventable cause of intellectual disability. The rates of fetal alcohol s yndrome are higher among AI/AN people than the general population. Screening with intervention has been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol misuse in pregnancy and to reduce the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome. The UIO s emphasi ze integrating b ehavioral health, health education, health promotion, and disease prevention into primary care offered within a culturally appropriate framework, which leads to positive outcomes for urban AI/AN people. Urban AI/AN people in need of substance use disorder treatment commonly exhibit co-occurring disorders. UIOs have recognized the need for more mental health and substance use disorder counselors to adequately address the needs presented by AI/AN people with co -occurring di sorders. Stakeholders reported the need for more age and gender-appropriate resources for substance use disorder outpatient and residential treatment. While male AI/AN people can encounter wait times for treatment admission up to six months, treatment options for youth, women, and women with children can be greater than six months. Some of the most successful AI/AN treatment programs for youth, women, and women with children are administered by UIOs. Affecting lifestyle changes among urban AI/AN familie s requires a culturally sensitive approach. UIOs have operated culturally appropriate initiatives to reduce health risk factors. The continued efforts of UIOs to target behavioral or lifestyle changes offer the best hope for impacting the major health ch allenges of the urban AI/AN population. The IHS has contracts and grants with 41 U IOs to provide health care and referral services for Urban Indians in 22 states. These IHS contracts and grants with UIOs address the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 by ensuring that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people. Awarding of these contracts and grants to UIOs also addresses HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.3, to r educe the impact of me ntal and substance use disorders through prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery support . UIOs provide high quality, culturally relevant prevention, early intervention, outpatient and residential substance abuse treatment services, and recovery support to address the unmet needs of the Urban Indian communit ies they serve. S ocial determinants of health play a key role in health and wellness and UIOs are addressing a range of factors which contribute to improved health outcomes. According to the most recent urban Indian data , 76,760 AI/AN patients access services through UIO programs. Also, UIOs perform ed 729,888 visits for AI/AN patients including medical, dental, behavioral health, other professional and enabling services directly or by paid refer ral. Data also indicates that members from 5 29 of the 5 74 (92 percent ) federal ly recognized T ribes accessed services from at least one of the 41 UIOs. CJ - 281 In FY 2020, the IHS Office of Urban Indian Health Programs awarded 4- in-1 grants to 33 U IOs. The grantees are awarded for a three-year funding cycle from April 1, 2019 - March 31, 2022. These grants provide funding to U IOs to make health care services more accessible for A I/AN s residing in urban areas. Funding is used to support four health program areas: health promotion and disease prevention services; immunization services; alcohol and substance abuse related services; and mental health services. G rantees are required to participate in a national evaluation of the 4 -in-1 grant program, which addresses IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 to promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization. The national evaluation includes reporting on the cultural interventions integrated into the 4 -in-1 program activities, and practice based and evidence based approaches that are implemented or modified to meet the needs of the Urban Indian service population. These grants expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, which meets HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2. PERFORMANCE Information regarding the performance of the drug control efforts of IHS are based on agency GPRA/ GPRAMA documents and other information that measure the agency's contribution to the Strategy. In FY 2022, the IHS will t rack the number of unique patients receiving office- based MAT (buprenorphine or naltrexone) within the Indian Healthcare System. The IHS will continue to track the number of naloxone prescriptions as part of efforts to increase access to naloxone. The table and accompanying text below represent highlights of IHS achievements during FY 2020, the latest year for which data are available. The selected performance measures reported in the table provide targets and results from both Tribally Operated Health Programs and Federally Administered Health Programs. Indian Health Service Selected Measures of Performance FY 20 20 Target FY 20 20 Achieved \u00bb Universal Alcohol Screening 42.4% 37.1% \u00bb Accreditation rate for Youth Regional Treatment Centers in operation 18 months or more 100% 100% \u00bb Report on number of emergency department patients who receive SUD intervention 40,781 44,451 \u00bb Report on number of SUD services in primary care clinics 145,006 137,907 To provide more comprehensive routine screening, IHS retired the alcohol screening measure for female patients and expanded the new alcohol screening measure to include all patients 9 through 75 years of age. The FY 20 20 universal alcohol screening target of 42.4 percent was not met with final results achi eving 37.1 percent screened. The accreditation measure for YRTCs reflects an evaluation of the quality of care associated with accreditation status by either The Joint Commission, the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), state certification, or regional Tribal health authority CJ - 282 certification. For youth with substance use disorders, the YRTCs provide invaluable treatment services. In FY 20 20, all YRTCs in operation 18 months or longer achieved accreditation status. The IHS monitors two program measures on the number of SUD encounters provided in emergency departments and primary care clinics. The final results for the FY 2019 number of SUD encounters provided in emergency department was 44,451 while SUD encounters provided in primary care clinics totaled 1 37,907. IHS monitors the overall SUD encounters provided in all clinical settings across the health system to aid in promoting integrated substance use disorder services. The final results for FY 2020 SUD intervention ser vices provided across all I /T/U clinics that report in the IHS national data warehouse was 718,873 encounters.

The Committee continues to direct IHS to examine its processes, determine needed changes and report to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act. (p. 125) Action taken or to be taken : For the first time, the FY 2022 President's Budget proposes advance appropriations for the IHS. This proposal is consistent with the feedback we have heard from Tribal and Urban Indian Leaders over the last several years. It is also consistent with the findings of GAO Report GAO-18-652, Indian Health Service: Considerations Related to Providing Advance Appropriation Authority. Advance appropriations will ensure a predictable funding source for the Indian health system, avoiding the negative consequences of funding delays under continuing resolutions, and lapses in funding during government shutdowns. With advance appropriations, the IHS could disburse funds more quickly, which could enable IHS, tribal, and urban Indian health program managers to effectively and efficiently manage budgets, coordinate care, and improve health quality outcomes for American Indians and Alaska Natives. This planning stability would reduce unnecessary contract and administrative costs. Funding continuity could also alleviate concerns from potential recruits, especially health care providers, about the stability of their employment. Events like the lapse in appropriations experienced in FY 2019 year undermine IHS's efforts to recruit and retain a quality workforce and provide a continuum of care that our patients deserve. The IHS has examined the issue, and does not believe that any additional authority from Congress is necessary to develop and manage an advance appropriation, beyond the advance appropriation itself. The IHS financial management system and processes are fully equipped to manage an advance appropriation. IHS has also engaged with the Veteran's Health Administration to understand how the agency manages its advanced appropriation, and will leverage best practices learned from those discussions. The IHS is committed to working together with Congress to answer any questions, clarify any points, and provide any other assistance to support enactment of this critical proposal. Current Services. - In fiscal year 2020, the Committee directed IHS to submit the actual estimated costs for current services based on the prior enacted level to the Committee each year at the same time IHS submits its annual budget justification. IHS did not provide this information for fiscal year 2021. The Committee again directs IHS to pr ovide this information at the same time the annual budget justification is submitted. The recommendation includes the Federal portion of current services (p. 123). Action taken or to be taken : The FY 2022 Congressional funding request for Current Services is $ 207,070,000, which would fully fund pay cost, inflation, and population growth needs for IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs in FY 2022. Please see the detailed Current Services request below: CJ - 288 FY 2022/2023 Current Services Estimate Pay Inflation Population Growth Current Services Sub Activity Total Total 1.8% Total SERVICES Hospitals & Health Clinics 65,609 7,607 41,843 115,059 Electronic Health Record 0 0 0 0 Dental Services 6,659 626 3,791 11,076 Mental Health 2,631 291 8,577 Care Improvement Fund 913 2,526 Total, Clinical Services 80,178 Nursing 2,703 Education 589 63 370 1,022 Comm.

The Committee expects the Service to continue including current services estimates for Urban Indian Health in annual budget requests. (p.131) CJ - 289Action taken or to be taken : The FY 2022 Congressional funding request for Current Services is $207,070,000, which includes $3 million for to fully fund pay costs, inflation, and population growth for Urban Indian Organizations. Accreditation Emergencies. - The Committee has heard complaints that not all funds appropriated for accreditation purposes are being distributed. Therefore, the Committee expects IHS to submit, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, a full accounting of the funds provided for accreditation emergencies in fiscal years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, including the amount and purpose of funds allocated to each facility. The Committee is concerned about financial losses from loss of CMS accreditation or of the requirement to divert patients at Service -operated facilities. The Committee considers the loss or imminent loss of accreditation to be an emergency. Funds allocated to a facility may be made available to Tribes newly assuming operation of such facilities pursuant to the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA) and shall be used by such Tribes to cover replacement of third-party revenues lost as a result of decertification, replacement of third -party carryover funds expended to respond to decertification, and reasonable costs of achieving recertification, including recruitment costs necessary to stabilize staffing. Additionally, the Com mittee continues to urge IHS to develop new strategies to improve how IHS programs, including those operated by Tribes under ISDEAA, can be supported to avoid these challenges and to refocus on both the quality of health care delivery and the improvement in health outcomes for, and health status of, Indian health program beneficiaries. This requires full Tribal consultation and the participation of the Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and State Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance programs. (p. 127) Action taken or to be taken : Since our last response to this report language in the FY 2021 Congressional Justification, the IHS has taken a number of steps to develop and implement new strategies to avoid future accreditation challenges. FY 2021 Activities t o Date Strategic Plan Implementation . The IHS Strategic Plan, which includes the elements of the IHS Quality Framework, is now formally assessed for implementation. The IHS Strategic Plan has focused IHS programs and activities on improving quality, safety, and sustained compliance across the IHS healthcare system. FY 2020 Activities Current Accreditation Status. The IHS has supported facilities in all 12 IHS Areas to achieve and maintain The Joint Commission (TJC) and Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Centers (AAAHC) accreditation standards and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) regulations for IHS Hospitals, Health Centers, Behavioral Health facilities, and Critical Assess Hospitals (CAH). o The IHS has also directed that all ambulatory care facilities attain Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) designation by the end of calendar year 2021. CJ - 290o As of September, 2020 100 percent of all IHS hospitals and CAHs have achieved and maintained CMS conditions of participation, 21 of 24 hospitals and CAHs have TJC accreditation, and 12 of 24 hospitals and CAHs have PCMH designation, and 90 percent of the IHS Health Centers and 50 percent of IHS hospitals with ambulatory care services have attained PCMH designation Credentialing and Privileging. The IHS i mplemented a credentialing and privileging software in all IHS healthcare facilities and are currently optimizing the system . The credentialing process evaluates the qualifications and practice history of a provider such as education, training, residency, and licensing. Privileging authorizes a healthcare practitioner to practice within a specified scope of patient care services. IHS Safety Tracking & Response . The IHS transitioned to the IHS Safety Tracking & Response (I- STAR), a system for reporting adverse event s, which replac es the legacy WebCident platform. The legacy WebCident system was originally developed in 2002, and was intended for only tracking worker injury reporting . After a phased rollout of I -STAR , including a pilot session , the system has now successfully launched across the Agency , offering improved reporting of patient safety data and increased analytic capabil ity. IHS Infection Prevention and Control . The IHS Infection Prevention and Control program developed resources for CEO oversight of infection control programs. As part of this effort, the program provided presentations on common infection control accreditation findings . The program also worked with the I- STAR team to incorporate infection control breaches and adverse incidents within the new reporting system. o The Infection Prevention and Control coordinator facilita ted American Hospital Association Certified Healthcare Environmental Services (EVS) Training which promotes standardization of evidence based infection control best management practices throughout the IHS. o The IHS also collaborated with CDC to provide infection control training to IHS areas to help meet industry standards for infection control, including sterilization and decontamination of surgical instruments used in patient care within hospitals, ambulatory care and dental facilities. Wait Time Stand ards . The IHS continues to monitor wait time standards for both the Emergency Department (ED) and Primary Care Visits. The ED wait time consists of two measures that align with industry standards: o 1) Median Time from ED Arrival Time to ED Departure Time for discharged ED patients of 120 minutes or less; and o 2) \"Left Without Being Seen\" rate of two percent or less . The IHS has seen improvements in ED wait times since the measure went live. Improv ing patient wait times ensures that timely primary care is available and accessible to IHS patients. These steps are in direct response to the GAO recommendation to improve oversight of patient wait times , which is closed as of March 2020. CJ - 291 Quality Assura nce Risk Management Committee. The IHS established the Quality Assurance Risk Management Committee (QARMC) to provide senior level oversight and management of complex, adverse patient safety events, and administrative matters involving fraud, waste, abuse, and employee misconduct within IHS- operated hospitals and clinics. The QARMC also perform s Agency -wide clinical and administrative risk management to identify systematic changes needed to improve the quality of health care services and IHS-operated hosp itals and clinics. The IHS is preparing the requested report on the uses of the Accreditation Emergency Funds and expects to transmit the report to Congress in the coming months. Staffing for New Facilities . In fiscal year 2020, Congress indicated IHS is expected to detail the transfer of Staffing for New Facilities funding into the base amount for each facility in its annual budget justification. IHS did not include this for fiscal year 2021. Congress again directs IHS to include this information in future budget justifications. (p. 125) Action taken or to be taken : To better display the base funding amounts for staffing for new facilities, the below table includes an additional Funding History display that shows the total funds provided for each facility, by year. Once a project reaches beneficial occupancy status and receives its staffing package, those staffing funds become part of that facility's recurring base.

N EACC = N ortheast A mbulatory C re 2021 December 2021 CJ - 293Electronic Dental Record . The Committee is concerned that the entire $2,000,000 provided in fiscal year 2020 was not directed towards EDR at additional dental centers. Therefore, the Committee directs IHS to submit an accounting of fiscal year 2020 funds and expects IHS to use the fiscal year 2021 funds only for EDR. In addition, IHS is directed to expand its efforts in planning and developing greater data and information exchange between the IHS EHR system and the EDR system. (p. 129) Action taken or to be t aken: The +$2 million for the Electronic Dental Record appropriated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 were used only for the Electronic Dental Record and were not distributed as tribal shares. FY 2020 funds supported: New Electronic Dental Record Implementation at 9 Sites ($906k) Electronic Health Record Program Enhancements, including key consent forms, quality review, and ot her reports ($615k), Electronic Dental Record Upgrade Support for 64 sites ($400k) , and Other activities including developing new Electronic Dental Record technology and training ($179k). The FY 2020 activities include some base resources, in addition to the +$2 million increase. FY 2021 funds are supporting: New Electronic Dental Record Implementation at 9 -11 Sites ($1.2m) Electronic Health Record Program Enhancements, including charting, note taking, and quality review enhancements ($350k), Electronic Dental Record Upgrade Support for 108 sites ($750k), and Other activities including developing new Electronic Dental Record technology and training ($200k). These amounts are estimates and may change. Indian Health Care Improvement Act . It has been over nine years since the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), yet many of the provisions in the law remain unfunded. Tribes have specifically requested that priority areas for funding focus on diabetes treatment and prevention, behavioral health, and health professions. The Commit tee requests that the Service provide, no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, a detailed plan with specific dollars identified to fully fund and implement the IHCIA. (p. 132) Action taken or to be taken : The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) is the cornerstone legal authority for the provision of health care to American Indian and Alaska Natives. The authorization was made permanent as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) on March 23, 2010. The IHCIA includes a number of authorizations, and a list of those sections is included in Appendix A. Estimating the cost of fully funding those provisions would be a significant endeavor, requiring CJ - 294significant tribal consultation and urban confer. It would also be a resource intensive process that would likely require additional appropriations to conduct appropriately. However, the IHS has several existing methodologies of estimating funding need that can be used as a proxy to estimate the funding needed for the various authorized sections of the IHCIA. Those measures include: Indian Health Care Improvement Fund Workgroup Interim Report. The 2018 Indian Health Care Improvement Fund Formula identified a total funding need of over $16 billion for health care and related services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. This estimate does not take into account facilities funding needs, or funding needs for major projects, like Electronic Health Record modernization. Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Care Facilities' Needs Assessment. Every five years, the IHS transmits the Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Care Facilities' Needs Assessment Report to Congress . This report describes the comprehensive, national, ra nked list of all health care facilities needs for the IHS, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations. The most recent version of this plan was completed in FY 2016, and identifies a $14.5 billion funding need for health care facilities in Indian Country. o This estimate includes the $2.1 billion needed to complete the 1993 Health Care Facilities Construction Priority List. o It also includes the top 5 Tribally -prioritized facility types newly authorized in the IHCIA, listed below. These five facility types total $4.3 billion of the $14.5 billion total. Inpatient mental health/behavioral health and alcohol substance abuse program facilities, Long- term care facilities - Clinical, Long- term care facilities - Non-clinical, Specialty Medical Services facilities, and Dialysis facilities. Annual Report on Sanitation Deficiency Levels for Indian Homes and Communities. Each year, the IHS transmits the Annual Report on Sanitation Deficiency Levels for Indian Homes and Communities to Congress . The information in this report to Congress is used by the Indian Health Service (IHS) to establish budgetary funding requests and to allocate funding resources received. Additionally, the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development, and the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation utilize the information contained in this report to aid in the implementation of their programs that support tribal water, sewer, and solid waste infrastructure. The current Feasible Project Cost Estimate from the IHS Sanitation Deficiency System totals nearly $1 billion, and the total cost of all projects in the Sanitation Deficiency System is over $2.5 billion . Backlog of Essential Maintenance and Repair (BEMAR) . The IHS maintains and regularly updates the BEMAR for IHS and Tribal health programs. The total BEMAR is $945 million. Payment for Tribal Leases. The Committee recommends an indefinite appropriation estimated to be $101,000,000 for Payment for Tribal Le ases incurred by the agency as required by law. The bill includes language making such sums as are necessary to meet the Federal government's full legal obligation and CJ - 295prohibits the transfer of funds to any other account for any other purpose. The Committe e expects IHS to consult with Indian tribes on the implementation of this new budget line. Action taken or to be taken : See response under Payment for Tribal Leases in Joint Explanatory Statement Significant Items section. Health Care Facilities Construction. IHS did not provide an accurate 5-year spend plan to the Committee in a time ly manner. Going forward the Committee expects IHS to submit an accurate, updated 5-year spend plan at the same time the annual budget justification is submitted to Congress. (p. 133-134) Action taken or to be taken : An accurate 5 -year Facilities Plan that reflects the FY 2022 President's Budget funding levels and policies is included in the OPDIV -Specific chapter of the FY 2022 Congressional Justification. Green Infrastructure . The Committee directs IHS to submit a report to the Committee within 9 0 days of enactment of this Act explaining how it proposes to use the funds provided for green infrastructure and renewable energy. Action taken or to be taken : The IHS will support the following green infrastructure activities with the $5 million provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021: Southcentral Foundation LED Conversion for Building 119, Southcentral Foundation LED Conversation for Building 122, Village Clinic Energy Retrofits, Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation Solar and Water Project, Pascua Yaqui Tribe Lighting, Solar Water Heater, and Solar Energy Project, Packer Energy Renovation, Pechanga Indian Health Clinic Solar Energy Project, MCAT Health Bo ard Carport Solar Energy Project, Cass Lake Geothermal Energy Project, White Earth Geothermal Energy, Torres Martinez Clinic Solar Energy, Sacramento Native American Health Clinic Solar and Recharging Project, and Cass Lake Geothermal Energy Project. CJ - 296INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE FY 2022 CONGRESSIONAL JUSTIFICATION Joint Explanatory Statement 116-260 Significant Items Electronic Health Record . - The Committees recognize the need for a new electronic health record system to improve the overall interoperability, efficiency, and security of the Service's information technology system. The Committees also note that the Service has not completed directives on this topic included in previous fiscal years and solicited in hearings. The Committees dire ct the Service to report back within 120 days of enactment of this Act with a list of Tribes that currently maintain their own non - RPMS electronic health record systems along with cost estimates required for those Tribes to implement, maintain, and make an y necessary upgrades to these systems. Further directions and limitations on expenditures are provided in the bill. The Committees understand that many Tribes recently upgraded their systems to be compatible with the new Veterans Affairs' system, and that these systems must be compatible with any new IHS system to the maximum extent practicable. It is the Committees' expectation that the Service will be able to use the compiled information gathered during this recent effort with Veterans Affairs to inform both the Service and the Committees on which Tribes use their own system and the estimated costs. (p. 78-79) Action taken or to be taken : As part of its Health Information Technology Modernization initiative the IHS has designed a brief data call requesting information from Tribes that currently maintain their own non- RPMS electronic health record systems, as directed by the Joint Explanator y Statement (P.L. 116-260). The IHS is currently working through Departmental policies for data collection, and expects to distribute the data call shortly. Consistent with the IHS's current authorities, the IHS cannot require Tribal health programs to respond to the data call. However, the Agency will request that Tribal health programs voluntarily complete it to the best of their ability. The IHS will compile information received from Tribal health programs, and provide that information in a Report to Congress. Payments for Tribal Leases. The bill includes language establishing an indefinite appropriation for payment of Tribal leases under section 105(1) of the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act, which are estimated to be $101,000,000 in fiscal year 2021. The new account provides additional budget authority to fully fund such costs without the need for reprogramming, if actual costs exceed the current estimate. IHS is reminded of the directive to continue to seek a longer- term s olution, as contained in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 116-94. Further direction is provided in the bill under Title IV of this division. (p. 80) Action taken or to be taken : The FY 2022 President's Budget proposes to shift funding for Tribal Lease Payment and Contract Support Costs to an annual mandatory indefinite appropriation beginning in FY 2023. Section 105( l) Lease Agreements. In March 2016, the Maniilaq Association v. Burwell decision established a new funding entitlement for Tribal contractors and compactors as authorized by section 105( l) of the ISDEAA. The court ruled that the Secretary must compensate reasonable CJ - 297costs to each Tribe or Tribal organization who enters into a section 105( l) lease agreement. The court also prohibits IHS from capping funding under section 105( l) at the level that IHS would have otherwise spent to operate a facility if it were carrying out the health programs. o In FY 2021, Congress enacted an indefinite discretionary appropriation to fully fund these costs. An indefinite discretionary appropriation allows IHS to fund section 105( l) lease agreements at the actual total funding need for the fiscal year, aligning the budget to the court decisions in Maniilaq Association v. Burwell . This funding mechanism avoids the need to redirect funding that IHS would otherwise use to provide direct services to Tribes. o These costs are more appropriately funded from mandatory appropriations, consistent with other indefinite authorities. Contract Support Costs. In 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States established a new funding entitlement for Tribal contractors and compactors when they ruled in Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter that the Federal government is responsible for fully reimbursing actual contract support costs, regardless of the previous appropriations limit for this funding. In FY 2016, Congress provided an indefinite discretionary appropriation for contract support costs in the annual appropriations bill. o An indefinite discretionary appropriation allows IHS to fund contract support costs at the actual total funding need for the fiscal year, aligning the budget to the Supreme Court's decision in Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter . This funding mechanism avoids the need to redirect funding that IHS would otherwise use to provide direct services to Tribes. o These costs are more appropriately funded from mandatory appropriations, consistent with other indefinite authorities. Payments for Tr ibal Leases. The agreement incorporates the fiscal year 2021 budget proposal to create separate appropriations accounts for 105(1) Tribal payments along with a general provision directing the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service to devel op guidelines regarding lease costs. The Committees strongly encourage both Departments to engage in meaningful dialogue with one another and Tribes to coalesce around a process to develop policy guidance. (p. 6) The Committees also note that payments for 105(1) leases directly resulting from decisions in the case of Maniilaq Ass'n v. Burwell in both 2014 (72 F. Supp. 3d 227 (D.D.C. 2014)) and 2016 (70 F. Supp. 3d 243 (D.D.C. 2016)) appear to create an entitlement to compensation for 105(1) leases that is typically not funded through discretionary appropriations, and the Committees encourage discussion regarding the funding classification to continue. The Committees are aware of recent litigation in Federal courts regarding what constitutes reasonable lease costs under the 105(1) program. As part of the consultation required by language in Title IV of this Act, the Indian Health Service and the Department of the Interior are expected to consult with Tribes and Tribal organizations regarding agency regulations and policies that determine the amount of space and other standards necessary to carry out federal programs under a section 105(1) lease, and to ensure that such regulations and policies are consistent, transparent and clearly communicated to affected Tribes. The Service and the Department are expected to periodically update the Committees on the status of the consultation. (p. 6) CJ - 298 Action taken or to be taken : The IHS is working to comply with the Tribal Lease Payments bill and report language, which is also consistent with feedback we have received from Tribal Leaders. We have had an initial discussion with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to understand their thinking on how to proceed. We plan to finalize a timeline and approach for tribal consultation in the coming weeks , and will keep the Committees apprised on progress. Senate Report 116-123 Requirements . IHS is expected to comply with the instructions and requirements at the beginning of this division and in House Report 116-448, unless otherwise specified below. Language contained in Senate Report 116- 123 regarding the Alaska Comprehensive Forensic Training Academy, first aid kit enhancements, prescription drug monitoring, and teledermatology is restated. o First Aid Kit Enhancements .\u2014The Committe e is aware that first aid products endorsed by the Department of Defense's Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care [CoTCCC] help to reduce death or trauma as a result of bleeding. The Committee believe these products could help the Service save lives, especially in rural areas where it might take significant time to transport a patient to a hospital and/or healthcare facility for appropriate treatment. Accordingly, the Committee encourages the Service to analyze incorporating CoTCCC's hemostatic dressing of choice in healthcare facilities and vehicles and provide a report to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act. Action taken or to be taken : The use of hemostatic dressings is an element of the standard of care in the initial management o f trauma patients and should be included, along with basic education around the use of such materials, as standard equipment for rural EMS and ED inventories. IHS will provide a recommendation to IHS, tribal, and Urban facilities for EMS and ED to consider adding these materials for EMS and ED use. o Prescription Drug Monitoring .\u2014The Committee is concerned that IHS and Tribally operated health facilities are not participating in State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs and emergency department information exchanges. The Committee strongly encourages these facilities to participate in these programs. Accordingly, within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Service shall provide the Committee with a report outlining by State such facilities that are partici pating and those that are not and any issues preventing facilities from uploading data to these programs or exchanges. Action taken or to be taken : Although there is no federal law requiring IHS to report to state PDMPs, in June of 2016 IHS implemented Indian Health Manual Part 3 Chapter 32 \"State Prescription Drug Monitoring Program\", which requires all IHS federal pharmacies to report controlled prescriptions to their respective state PDMPs. Currently all IHS Federal Facilities, with pharmacies, report to the state PDMP, in the state where they are located. In addition, in May 2019, IHS released PDMP reporting software that reports to state PDMPs automatically, when a prescription is filled, in near real time. IHS does not track the participation of Tr ibally -operated health facilities with State PDMPs. A list of all IHS facilities with pharmacies, and the State PDMPs they report to is included below.

The Committee recognizes that access to specialty programs like tele-dermatology help fill important gaps in the Service to diagnose and treat disease and encourages the Service to expand access to these programs and make needed equipment investments, such as mobile high definitio n cameras, to support them. Action taken or to be taken : Less than 10 percent of all dermatologists practice in rural areas while 40 percent practice in the 100 densest US areas. 1 According to the American Academy of Dermatology, the ideal dermatologist to population ratio is 3.5 per 100,000 (although the appropriate ratio has never been validated) and the mean dermatologist to population ratio of rural counties is 423 per 100,000 people. 1 However, 88 percent of rural counties have zero dermatologists.1 The 26 Nati ve American majority counties have no dermatologists.1 The IHS has considered potential options for expanding tele-dermatology. One cost -effective solution could be to expand the tele-dermatology capacity of the Phoenix Indian Medical Center as well as leveraging private dermatologists who are willing to provide tele -dermatology services pro bono. Long- term solution s like targeted recruiting efforts, and the purchase of mobile high definition cameras would likely require additional resources. 1Vaidya T et al. \"Socioeconomic and Geographic Barriers to Dermatology Care in Urban and Rural US Populations,\" J Am Acad Derm atol Feb 2018: 406 -408.

Because the cost of vaccines for children < 19 years of age is covered by the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program , only the costs for vaccine administration, which are not covered by the VFC program, are included for this age group. Vaccine administration fees were based on an average of the CMS Maximum Regional Charges for vaccine administration , multiplied by the number of doses of vaccine routinely recommended for each age group ( e.g., 25 total vaccine doses for children 2 yrs ). Estimated immunization expenditures include projected costs for routine, on -schedule immunization s among core patient demographic groups based on current age -appropriate 1. The immunization estimates do not include the Hepatitis B and Haemophilus Immuniz ation (AK) program; estimates for these immunizations are included under the Immunization Alaska budget. CJ - 305immu nization schedules . Other individuals outsi de these core patient group s may be regular recipients o f immunizations (e.g., health care workers; patients at specific increased risk for certain vaccine -preventable diseases). Howe ver, there is not currently a methodology to accurately estimate the size or vaccination coverage ra tes for all of these patient groups . Therefore, some special pa tient groups are excluded from these expenditure estimates. Costs for monitoring of immunization coverage were also included and represent a 1.039 percent increase over the FY 20 21 estima te: FY 201 8 Estimated Costs = FY 201 7 cost plus 3.9 percent FY 201 9 Estimated Costs = FY 201 8 cost plus 3.9 percent FY 20 20 Estimated Costs = FY 201 9 cost plus 1.0 percent FY 20 21 Estimated Costs = FY 20 20 cost plus 1.0 percent FY 20 22 Estim ated Costs = FY 20 21 cost plus 1.0 percent For FY 2022, $120,498,813 is estimated for vaccine costs, and $ 149,599 for immunization monitoring costs, for a total of $120,648,412 estimated for all immunization expenditures. This represents a $19,156,028 increase from the FY 20 21 estimate attributable to changes in vaccine costs, shifting population sizes among age categories targeted for immunization , and progress towards immunization coverage goa ls aligned with Healthy People 20 30 targets (i.e., fewer individuals still needing vacc ination which translates to reduced forecasted costs) . Calculations for the costs included as part of the FY 2022 estimated immunization costs were based on the assumptions outlined in the table below: Estimated User Population (FY 2020) Coverage Goal Current Coverage * No. to be vaccinated Vaccine costs (per dose) ** Admin fee (per dose) \u00a7 No. of doses per patient Total Immun . expenditures per patient Total Infants, 2 NA 47,643 NA NA UNK UNK NA NA NA NA NA Vaccine Costs $120,498,813 Monitoring $149,599 Total Costs $120,648,412 Based on Healthy People 20 30, where applicable . CJ - 306 *Coverage estimates based on most current coverage levels available (FY 20 21 Quarter 1); coverage estimates for diabetics ages 19 - 59 years includes those patients immune to Hepatitis B for reasons other than immunization ; HPV estimate is based on 3 dose series ; coverage listed as 'NA' either not applicable due t o age -related cohort turnover each year or recurr ing annual immunization requirement each year (i.e., influenza); coverage estimate noted as 'UNK' is currently unknown and unavailable. **Cost per dose for routine childhood vaccines administered up to and including age 18 are covered by the Vaccines for Children program; c ost per dose determined from the CDC Adult Vaccine Price List dated April 1, 2021. Lowest published price is generally used where multiple products or formulations are available . https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine -management/price -list/index.html \u00a7Based on an average of the state CMS Maximum Regiona l Charges for Vaccine administration. FY 2022 will the first full year of administering the COVID -19 vaccine (s). Due to the rapidly evolving COVID -19 vaccine landscape, a full year estimate is currently unavailable . Overall, the estimated costs above reflect projected costs for routine, on -schedule immunizations but with caveats : 1. Other i ndividuals outside these core patient groups are regular recipients of immunizations (e.g., immunization for health care workers and those at specific risk for other vaccine -preventable diseases) . However, th ere is not currently a methodology to estimate the size of these groups to effectively track vaccination coverage rates . 2. The CMS Maximum Regional Charges for Vaccine administration was used to estimate indirect costs because the re is no specific methodolog y to estimate indirect costs or administrative overhead associated with the administration of immunizations system -wide , or operation of the overall immunization program.

Current Law : Sequestration is the legislatively mandated process of budget control consisting of automatic, across -the-board spending reductions to enforce budget targets to limit federal spending. It was first established by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA, Title II of P.L. 99-177, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 900-922) to enforce ection 255 of BBEDCA (2 U.S.C. \u00a7 905) identifies programs that are exempt from sequestration, and Section 256 of BBEDCA (2 U.S.C. \u00a7 906) establishes special rules. Whi le 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 906(e) ostensibly sets IHS's discretionary funding sequester level to 2% of its total, Section 251A(5), Implementing Discretionary Reductions, does not apply the special rules of Section 256; they are only used in Implementing Direct Spending Reductions (Section 251A(6)), which results in reductions in IHS's discretionary accounts on the same basis as other nonsecurity accounts. Inclusive of the 2% sequestered from the mandatory Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI, limited to a 2% reduction), a total of $219.6 million was sequestered from IHS's budget, which was 5.1% of the resources appropriated in FY 2013 for Indian health programs. Rationale : All programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs are exempt from a sequestration reduction ordered under the BBEDCA and the BCA. Through this exemption Congress e xpressly indicated how critical it is for services provided by the VA not to be disrupted or reduced as a result of sequestration. Se ction 255 of BBEDCA (codified at 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 905) identifies programs that are exempt from sequestration. These include programs providing critical support to vulnerable groups within the United States, including children (Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Child Nutrition Programs, and foster care) and low income persons/families (Medicaid, TANF, Family Support Prog rams), health benefits to retirees, veterans and service members (Veterans Affairs, Annuitants, Employees Health Benefits, Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund, Medical Benefits for Commissioned Officers, Public Health Service). Many of the exempted programs reimburse the IHS for services rendered including Medicaid, Medicare (treated under special limiting rules), CHIP, and Veterans Health program reimbursement. The services provided by the IHS are no less critical. Budget reductions of any kind h ave implications for the services IHS, Tribes, and Urban Indian organizations provide to American Indian and Alaska Native patients and communities. In FY 2013, these reductions resulted in dramatic oversight and administration reductions to maintain servi ce levels, limitations to CJ - 312 patients being able to see outside specialists beyond Priority 1 (emergent or acutely urgent care), and reductions to services paid for through offsetting collections. Future sequesters would not only damage the lives and health of American Indians and Alaska Natives through reduced direct services and care, it would also impair IHS's efforts to improve medical quality, implement improvements/replacement to its Electronic Health Record System, and reduce critical health care staffi ng vacancies among other impacts. The impact of a sequestration on the IHS will be highly variable, both based on the overall sequester level, interpretation of sequester policy (e.g., OMB's decision applying the 2% limitation only to the mandatory SDPI) , as well as the availability of third party resources to ameliorate budget reductions to critical care areas. Additionally, the date in the fiscal year in which it is implemented will add to the effect of the impact. Notice earlier in the fiscal year would allow for a minimal impact, evenly reducing the reduction across 12 full months of the fiscal year, whereas later notice would impact operations more greatly. An illustrative example is included below to demonstrate the impact of a sequestration on IHS. For the purposes of calculating the following estimate, a sequestration reduction percentage to IHS programs (excepting the SDPI program, which is capped at 2 percent) is assumed to be 7.5 percent, in the range of modest reduction levels, applied equally across IHS programs, projects or activities, as implemented in FY 2013. Using FY 2016 performance results as the base, a reduction of $267.5 million would be taken from the IHS's Appropriation, which would result in estimated impacts over the following se lected measures: Es timated Impact on Health Care Delivered by a National 7.5% Sequester Reduction Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Assessment Number Carried out in FY 2016 30,040 Sequester Reduction 2,253 Number of Patients Who Receive Depression Screening Number Carried out in FY 2016 515,692 Sequester Reduction 38,677 Number of Patients Who Receive Colorectal Cancer Screening Number Carried out in FY 2016 165,056 Sequester Reduction 12,379 Number of Patients Who Receive Alcohol Screening: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Prevention Screening Number Carried out in FY 2016 205,952 Sequester Reduction 15,446 Number of Patients Who Receive Mammography Cancer Screening Number Carried out in FY 2016 55,808 Sequester Reduction 4,186 CJ - 313 Number of AI/AN patients (age 19 -35 months) who have received the combined childhood vaccination series Number Carried out in FY 2016 63,423 Sequester Reduction 4,757 Number of AI/AN patients (ages 18+) who have received the influenza vaccine Number Carried out in FY 2016 515,692 Sequester Reduction 38,677 Number of AI/AN patients who have received dental services Number Carried out in FY 2016 1,093,321 Sequester Reduction 81,999 Performance Measurement Explanation https://www.ihs.gov/crs/includes/themes/newihstheme/display_objects/d ocuments/crsv16/GPRA MeasuresV161.pdf Budget Impact : This is a budget related and discretionary proposal that was submitted by the IHS in previous years; however, it was not included in the President's FY 2021 Budget. While resulting in no change to IHS's funding, it would increase the amount of sequestered funding taken from remaining non- exempt agencies. Effective Date: Upon enactment. Impact on Other Agencies: This is noted in the \"Budget Impact\" section of the proposal: While resulting in no change to IHS's funding, it would increase the amount of sequestered funding taken from remaining non- exempt agencies. Other Data: None. CJ - 314 IHS-3 Bu dget FISC AL YEAR 2022 HHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Provide the Indian Health Service Discretionary Use of all Title 38 Personnel Authorities Proposal : The Indian Health Service (IHS) is seeking the discretionary use of all United States Code Title 38 authorities under Part V, Chapter 74, \"Veterans Health Administration - Personnel\", that are primarily available to the Department of Veterans Affairs (V A) in relation to health care positions. The term \"health care occupations\" refers to positions, other than positions in the Senior Executive Service, that provide direct patient- care services or services incident to direct patient -care which would normally be covered by Title 5 of the United States Code. Current Law : Title 38 Part V, Chapter 74, governs all aspects of personnel administration for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) unless expressly overridden by another law or regulation. In many a reas of personnel administration, the VHA is exempt from Title 5 laws and regulations by virtue of Title 38. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), under the authority of section 1104 and 5371 of Title 5 of the United States Code, has authorized the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to use the Title 38 provisions pertaining to pay rates and systems, premium pay, classification, and hours of work. This delegation of authority is described in a delegation of authority between OPM and HHS - the latest version of which was effective March 6, 2019. If HHS, or an HHS Operating Division under the delegation of authority, chooses to use a Title 38 provision, the comparable authority under Title 5 is waived. However, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5371 does not provide authority to apply all personnel provisions of Title 38 in lieu of comparable Title 5 provisions. Rationale : The IHS, as a primarily rural healthcare provider, has difficulty recruiting healthcare professionals. The IHS has critical hiring needs for healthcare professionals in IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian programs including, but not limited to physicians, de ntists, nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. The ability to use Title 38 for pay purposes as noted above is beneficial because the IHS can offer market pay to physicians, dentists, and podiatrists as well as special salary rates to individuals in other health care occupations. However, the IHS's use of these compensation authorities is not adequate by itself to compete with other public sector agencies and private sector organizations. Ty pically, the private sector and the VHA can offer candidates better scheduling options and paid time off \u2014 particularly important benefits to providers who serve in remote and rural locations. The IHS faces specific public sector competition in the area of annual leave accrual. The VHA provides 1 day of annual leave per pay period for all (including new) physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, and chiropractors and 8 hours of annual leave accrual per pay period for all (including new) nurses, physician assistants, and expanded- functio n dental auxiliaries. Due to the limited scope of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5371, the IHS does not have 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421. \"Personnel Administration: in general\" that includes \"leaves of absence of employees\". Thus, when a candidate with just a f ew years of experience is choosing CJ - 315 between the IHS and the VHA, he or she will invariably choose the organization offering 1 day/8 hours of annual leave accrual per pay period, as opposed to just 4 or 6 hours of annual leave accrual per pay period that the IHS offers. Supervisors report anecdotally that the IHS has lost many candidates due to this difference in accrual rates. In addition to better scheduling options and paid time off, the IHS is seeking access to other Title 38 authorities to increase its competitive stance in the healthcare labor market and to create a more efficient and effective human resources program. This would include the potential for instituting two -year probationary periods for staff appointed under Title 38 and to have jurisdic tion over appeals for adverse actions involving professional conduct or competence pertaining to direct patient care and clinical competence instead of going through the Merit Systems Protection Board. Title 38 also exempts the VHA from collective bargaining and associated grievance procedures relating to issues concerning professional conduct competence, and peer review. In contrast, Title 5 permits the establishment of grievance procedures on any issue through the collective bargaining process. Budget Impact : This proposal is budget neutral. The IHS will accommodate funding requirements within existing resources. Effective Date: Upon enactment. Impact on Other Agencies : Not applicable. Other Data: None. CJ - 316 IHS-4 Non-B udget FIS CAL YEAR 2022 DHHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Facilities Renovation for Urban Indian Organizations to the Extent Authorized for Other Government Contractors Proposal : Amend federal law to permit the Indian Health Service (IHS) to make funds available to IHS -funded Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) for minor renovations to facilities or construction or expansion of facilities, including leased facilities, to the extent au thorized for other government contractors. This would allow UIOs the full authority that exists for other Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contractors. Current Law : Current federal law at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1659 permits the IHS to make funds available to UIOs to make minor renovations to facilities or construction or expansion of facilities, including leased facilities, but only to assist UIOs in meeting or maintaining accreditation standards of The Joint Commission (TJC). Because of the specificity of the language in Section 1659, the IHS cannot award funds to an UIO to make minor renovations, construct or expand facilities, unless the UIO is doing so to meet or maintain accreditation specifically from TJC. Rationale: The IHS enters into limited, comp eting contracts and grants with 41 501(c)(3) non- profit organizations to provide health care and referral services for Urban Indians throughout the United States. An UIO is defined by 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(29) as a nonprofit corporate body situated in an urban center, governed by an Urban Indian controlled board of directors, and providing for the maximum participation of all interested Indian groups and individuals, which body is capable of legally cooperating with other public and private entities for the purpose of performing the activities described in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(a). UIOs provide unique access to culturally appropriate and quality health care for Urban Indians. Cur rently, UIOs are seeking or maintaining accreditation from several health care accreditat ion organizations, including TJC, Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Healthcare (AAAHC), and Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). Some UIOs have also achieved recognition as Patient Centered Medical Homes (PCMH), with addi tional UIOs currently working towards PCMH recognition, as well as AAAHC accreditation. In addition, some UIOs must meet standards from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and/or their respective state departments of health. Expa nding the current authority to be consistent with the authority for other government contractors, rather than limiting it under Section 1659 to TJC, would allow UIOs to make renovations, construction, or expansion of facilities necessary to improve the safety and quality of care provided to Urban Indian patients. Currently, only 1 out of the 41 UIOs maintain TJC accreditation. CJ - 317 A large proportion of Urban Indians live in or near the poverty level and thus face multiple barriers to obtaining access to quality and cultura lly relevant health care services in urban centers. They must overcome additional barriers to receiving appropriate care such as lack of culturally appropriate care, lack of respect, lack of visibility, transportation issues, and communication obstacles th at often interfere with the delivery of high- quality health care to Urban Indians. Providing UIOs with broader authority, similar to other FAR contractors, to improve their health care facilities will assist in providing the high quality, safe, and cultura lly relevant health care for the Urban Indian population. Budget Impact : This is a non-budget related and discretionary proposal. Effective Date: Upon enactment. Impact on Other Agencies : Not applicable. Other Data: While there are a few other references in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) to accreditation by TJC, there is no mention of other accreditation bodies in either the IHCIA or Indian Self-Determination Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA). In addition, the Department of Veter ans Affairs' statutes do not make mention of specific accrediting bodies.

L. No.) 93 -638, as amended, which recognizes the unique legal and political relationship between the United States and Amer ican Indian and Alaska Native peoples. Accordingly, the IHS supports Tribal sovereignty: (1) by assisting Tribes in exercising their right to administer the IHS health programs, or portions thereof, and (2) by continuing to directly provide services to Tri bes that choose the IHS as their health care provider. A Tribal decision to enter or not enter into ISDEAA agreements are equal expressions of self -determination. Title I Contracts and Title V Self -Governance Compacts - Titles I and V of the ISDEAA provide Tribes the option to exercise the right to self -determination by assuming control and management of programs previously administered by the federal government. Since 1975, the IHS has entered agreements with Tribes and Tribal organizations to plan, conduc t, and administer programs authorized under Section 102 of the Act. Today, over $ 4.2 billion of the Agency's appropriation is transferred to Tribes and Tribal Organizations through Title I contracts and Title V compacts. Under Title I, there are 219 Tribes and Tribal Organizations operating 249 contracts and annual funding agreements. Under Title V, IHS is party to 105 compacts and 131 funding agreements; through which approximately $2. 6 billion of the IHS budget is transferred to Tribes and Tribal organizations. Sixty -five percent of federally recognized Tribes participate in Title V.

Congress authorized use of the funds for capital acquisitions necessary for the operation of the Department, specifically information technology (IT) and facilities infrastructure acquisitions. Information Technology Accompli shments The Indian Health Service (IHS) Health Information Technology (HIT) Program uses secure and reliable information technology (IT) in innovative ways to improve health care delivery and quality, enhance access to care, reduce medical errors, and modernize ad ministrative functions. IHS HIT provides support for the IHS, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) programs that care for 2.6 million American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people across the Indian health system. IHS provides the technology infrastructure for a na tionwide health care system, including a secure wide area network, enterprise e- mail services, and regional and national Help Desk support for approximately 20,000 network users. IHS HIT also supports the mission- critical health care operations of the I/T /U with comprehensive health information solutions including an Electronic Health Record (EHR) and more than eighty applications. The IHS HIT program directly supports better ways to 1) care for patients, 2) pay providers, 3) refer care when needed 4) recover costs, and 5) distribute information, resulting in better care, wiser spending of our health dollars, and healthier communities, economy, and country. NEF funds have allowed IHS to make capital investments through the Health IT Systems and Support (HITSS) project, enabling targeted upgrades toward its quarterly release schedule for the IHS electronic health records system software applications. New upgrades/accomplishments include: Improving Patient Care Program (IPC): Made critical upgrades to the iC are capability, National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS), and Clinical Reporting System (CRS) as part of IPC to support field level quality improvement activities. Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA): Continued implementation of a VA - developed BCMA solution, which is designed to prevent medication errors in healthcare settings and improve the quality and safety of medication administration, across the Indian health system. 1 Pursuant to Section 223 of Division G of the Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2008, notification is required of planned use. 2 The projects described below are the current list of approved projects through FY 2021. Additional projects may be funded from the FY 2021 notification letter upon approval from OMB. CJ - 324 Emergency Department (ED) Whiteboard : Developed and implemented the ED Whiteboard to facilitate the electronic tracking of patients. The ED Whiteboard will support clinical staff to avoid mistakes that could lead to patient safety issues. Suicide Risk Assessment : Created a report to track results of the RPMS Suicide Risk Assessment, which previously would have been a manual process of counting records. This allows sites to locally track their suicide intervention efforts, which may be used to report on grants, such as the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiat ive (MSPI). New Medicare Card Initiative Phases I & II: Developed and implemented Phase 1 of NMCI facilitating the documentation in RPMS of newly issued Medicare Beneficiary ID numbers; began NMCI Phase II development work. Windows 10 Infrastructure Upgrade : Upgraded the EHR and HITSS components to support migration to modernized platform; successfully tested, on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs and IHS, VistA Imaging (VI) against Win10 and gained FDA approval to use VI across over 400 sit es. Medication Information Management, Prescription Drug Monitoring : Development related to the Medication Information Management and Prescription Drug Monitoring program (PDMP). continued to support final phases for meeting the DEA regulations and HHS O ffice of National Coordinator (ONC) 2014 certification requirements for the IHS mandated project Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substance (EPCS). COVID- 19 Disease Surveillance Reporting: Developed a national disease surveillance dashboard that prov ided insights into COVID testing activity and status to over 300 federal, tribal and urban partners. Additional interface for reporting was developed to support the exchange of critical testing information with HHS. Opioid Surve illance Dashboard: An enterprise business intelligence solution was developed, for the HOPE committee, to promote appropriate and effective pain management, reduce overdose deaths from heroin and prescription opioid misuse, and improve access to culturally appropriate trea tment. Business Intelligence/Business Analytics Security Framework: Matured the enterprise security framework that manages, governs and enforces compliance with agency, privacy and program level security definitions, at the row or data column level. The security model promotes reusable solutions that meet national, area, service unit and individual facility reporting requirements. 2015 Certified Edition of RPMS: The IHS Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) has been certified by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). In announcing the RPMS 2015 Certified Health Information Technology (CHIT) certification, ONC stated that IHS \"meets the certification criteria identified in 45 CFR 170 Subpart C of the 2015 Edition ONC Standards and Certification Criteria.\" This certification ensures that the IHS, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) sites that installed the upgraded software by October 3, 2020 will continue to participate in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Meaningful Use (MU) program and be eligible for Medicare/Medicaid incentive payments and/or avoid payment adjustments. CJ - 325 Facilities Accomplishments The IHS Facility Construction Program has received $328.0 million for 38 projects funded by NEF allocations since 2015.

It will also align the Quality Metadata repository within the enterprise National Data Warehouse (NDW) to support quality and surveillance dashboarding and reporting. This would enhance visibility (surveillance, analytics, reporting) into several initiatives that include but are not limited to behavioral health, suicide risk reduction, opioid reporting and surveillance, clinical quality metrics, drug utilization, and disease management. o Opioid Prescribing Drug Monitoring ($1.5 million): This project will complete implementation efforts of both the core e- Prescribing system, as well as the mandated Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances (EPCS) functionality and processes. It will also to support the collection of pharmacy data and extension of the pharmacy data domain within the N ational Data Warehouse. o IHS Enterprise Business Intelligence Reporting Environment ($2.5 million): This project will improve the Qlik national reporting environment and ensure an ability to support ad hoc enterprise report requirements in support of mission critical reporting initiatives. Adoption of the Qlik business i ntelligence solution for analytics and reporting enables the CJ - 328 agency to quickly develop national reports that meet key stakeholder reporting requirements. Information Technology (IT) Operations Enhancements ($ 11.8 million) : o Modernize Enterprise IT Services ($ 6.3 million): This project will improve the cloud capabilities of IHS Health Information Technology (HIT) systems and improve IT services to support direct patient care. This project is a high priority requirement on the roadmap to modernize the IHS electronic health r ecord system, satisfies recommendations from the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and achieves Department data center consolidation goals. Expanding cloud capabilities enhances the cybersecurity capabilities of IHS and HIT systems and allows IHS to centralize and consolidate IT services. o Improve IT Service Management Maturity ($2.5 million): This project will mature IT Service Management (ITSM) capabilities and improve IT and HIT systems that support direct patient care. This project delivers consistent processes and centralizes ITSM capabilities to improve IHS IT services. This project also allows the IHS to develop a centralized capability to assist in stronger cybersecurity management of IHS IT and HIT systems. o Lifecycle Replacement of Criti cal Hardware ($3 million): This project will replace end- of-life network and data center hardware critical to HIT services that support direct patient care. IHS has thousands of devices that pose a significant cybersecurity risk , are operating beyond the manufacturer's supported lifecycle, and are no longer covered by warranties or service agreements. Additionally, these out of date devices pose a significant cybersecurity risk as they can no longer be patched or secured against threats. This project is part of a multi -year strategy to improve lifecycle management of all IHS hardware. CJ - 329 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK "}
