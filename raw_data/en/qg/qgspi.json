Researchers reviewed 49 previous vaccine studies in humans dating back three decades that document how depression, loneliness, stress, and poor lifestyle behaviors negatively impact the body's immune system to vaccination, while improving health factors is said to enhance the response. Essentially, the impaired immune responses landed in three categories: - Interference with the development of antibodies against the pathogen - More rapid erosion of antibody protection that does develop - Intensification of the vaccination's side effects Researchers suggest the constant stress of the pandemic itself, and the disruption of our routines, work/life balance, and social lives, may have set us back when it comes to maintaining healthy behaviors. In fact, across the globe, fewer steps have been recorded by Fitbit trackers, according to the company's data. Additional numbers report higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, spikes in alcohol sales and overeating, and increased insomnia during lockdown.

Vaccines challenge the immune system; a stronger the immune system will, in turn, produce a stronger response to the COVID-19 vaccine. Wellness enhancements could include: - Changes to nighttime routine to increase sleep - Practicing mindfulness meditation - Nutrition improvement - Quitting or cutting back on tobacco use (long-term, or even short-term right around time of vaccination) - Seeking help if experiencing depression \"When we think of vaccine efficacy, we often think of the vaccine itself,\" says Annelise Madison, first author of the paper and a graduate student in clinical psychology at Ohio State. \"My motivation was to draw attention to the fact that we bring important factors to the table as well\u2014and those factors are modifiable. If we can address them now, when most of the world has yet to receive the vaccine, we have the chance to make our response to the vaccine quicker, more robust, and lasting.\" [ Read: [Young Adults 'Stress Eat' to Cope with Pandemic Discomforts](https://healthecareers.com/article/healthcare-news/young-adults-stress-eat-to-cope-with-pandemic-discomforts) ] Researchers say that even the best vaccines don't work for everyone. Effectiveness outside the confines of highly controlled clinical trials is typically lower than the initial trial's efficacy rate. How effective the vaccine is in the \"real world\" compared to a trial isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. Vaccine efficacy relies greatly on vaccine-related factors, and characteristics of the vaccinated are found to be important as well. Senior author Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, director of Ohio State's Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research and a professor of psychiatry and psychology in the College of Medicine, spearheaded several study reviews. Kiecolt-Glaser and her late husband, immunologist Ronald Glaser, were forerunners in mind-body research that showed how stress impairs physical health in several ways, predominately by hindering the human immune response.
