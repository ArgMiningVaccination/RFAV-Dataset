Stress, poor posture, a snug waistline, and years of shallow breathing are some of the reasons why our breath doesn't make it down to the bottom of our lungs. By consciously breathing 'into' your tummy, you can increase your energy and improve your stamina (aim for at least 5-10 minutes every day or, better still, whenever you think of it) Tip #2: Get a Good Nights Sleep The later in the evening we fall asleep and the later in the morning we wake up, the more out of sync our body clock becomes. Try going to bed before 10pm, and aim for 8 hours of sleep. It may be difficult to get used to, especially if you work late or if night-time is your only downtime, but you'll be rewarded with increased energy. Tip #3: Avoid energy-sappers Not enough alkaline-forming foods in your diet - Foods that are alkaline-forming include figs, green leafy vegetables, almonds, beets, dates, celery, canteloupe, molasses and parsley. Excess sugar - This causes fluctuations in blood sugar, which can result in plummeting energy levels. Avoid all forms of refined sugar as much as you can. Watch out for low-fat foods - many have forms of sugar, such as high-fructose corn syrup, added to make the food more palatable. Insufficient protein - With high-protein, low-carb diets being so popular, it's hard to believe but insufficient protein is a common reason for fatigue. Pack some almonds and nuts for a quick and convenient protein snack. Too much coffee - Although coffee initially raises stress hormones and gives a rush of energy, consuming several cups or more of coffee per day can promote burnout. Try to gradually cut back to one cup a day. Not enough water - One of the most common reasons for low energy is not drinking enough water. Tip #4: Take 20 Minutes Every Day Just For You Create a daily ritual where you take 20 to 30 minutes for yourself just relaxing and doing nothing (no watching tv or surfing the net). Pick up a book, listen to music, meditate, have a cup of tea, or try a new yoga pose. Tip #5: Consider a Stress-Formula Multivitamin People who are under chronic stress require more B vitamins. A stress formula multivitamin often has more B vitamins "}
