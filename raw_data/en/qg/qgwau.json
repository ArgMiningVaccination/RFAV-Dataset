Major finding: Invasive acupuncture vs control interventions significantly reduced pain (mean difference [MD] 1.00; P = .04), Health Assessment Questionnaire score (MD 0.20; P < .001), Physician Global Assessment score (MD 0.98; P < .001), tender joint count (MD 1.24; P = .005), C-reactive protein level (MD, 1.81; P = .019), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (MD, 3.03; P = .032). Similar benefits were observed with laser acupuncture. No adverse events were reported. Study details: This was a meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials including 796 patients with RA, of which 402 received acupuncture therapy and 394 received control interventions.
