It includes journal articles, books, and conference proceedings, and the content is sourced from MEDLINE and hand searches. CMR contains studies of methods used in reviews and more general methodological studies that could be relevant to anyone preparing systematic reviews. CMR records contain the title of the article, information on where it was published (bibliographic details), and, in some cases, a summary of the article. They do not contain the full text of the article. The CMR was produced by the [Cochrane UK](https://uk.cochrane.org/), until 31st May 2012. There are currently no plans to reinstate the CMR and it is not receiving updates.* If you have any queries, please contact the Cochrane Community Service Team ( [support@cochrane.org](mailto:support@cochrane.org)). The Publishers, John Wiley & Sons Ltd, thanks Update Software for the continued use of their data formats in the Cochrane Methodology Register (CMR). *Last update in January 2019. |Title| Relation between experimental and non-experimental study designs. HB vaccines: a case study |Authors| Jefferson T, Demicheli V. |Source| Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health |Date publication| |Volume| 53 |Issue| 1 |Pages| 51-54 |Abstract| STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between experimental and non-experimental study design in vaccinology. DESIGN: Assessment of each study design's capability of testing four aspects of vaccine performance, namely immunogenicity (the capacity to stimulate the immune system), duration of immunity conferred, incidence and seriousness of side effects, and number of infections prevented by vaccination. SETTING: Experimental and non-experimental studies on hepatitis B (HB) vaccines in the Cochrane Vaccines Field Database. RESULTS: Experimental and non-experimental vaccine study designs are frequently complementary but some aspects of vaccine quality can only be assessed by one of the types of study. More work needs to be done on the relation between study quality and its significance in terms of effect size. |CMR keywords| CMR: "}
