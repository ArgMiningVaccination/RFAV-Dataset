Detoxing can mean many things. Whether it's in the form of a diet, a relaxing day at the spa, or a vast getaway to a foreign country. It is something we should all do for our overall health and well-being. However, some would argue the most powerful form of detoxing is outside of the physical. While this could be through herbal remedies or meditation, our focus will be on healing crystals. We're going to cover a variety of crystals that are believed to help you align better spiritually, detox you from all kinds of ill energy, and improve your overall health. 1. LABRADORITE Known for its intuitive abilities, and as the \"Stone of Magic\", labradorite is also believed to be an incredible crystal for assisting with detoxing. It is thought to fully cleanse one's energy and connect them to the path of purity and light.

This could be excellent for connecting with synchronicities and spiritual expansion. Talk about a powerful crystal! 2.

It is also believed to be an ideal crystal to wear in jewelry when overcoming a breakup or relationship troubles. 4. SELENITE With a beautiful, shimmering white appearance, selenite is said to be one of the best crystals to rapidly remove energy blockages within the body. It's thought to be an excellent calming and balancing stone for those with anxiety, or for those that tend to overthink. Selenite is even believed to assist in the expansion of the crown chakra, which could help connect with the spiritual realm for spiritual detoxing.

AMAZONITE With a history of treating illness in the old days, amazonite could be a fantastic companion to have at your side for many reasons.

It is believed to act as a reset button, allowing one to reset their energy back to its natural and pure state.

DANBURITE A stone that is thought to possess incredible power, which often goes unnoticed, is danburite.

In a spiritual sense, it is thought to help harness one's inner strength, as well as assist in cleansing of the mind, body, and spirit. With all of its potential healing abilities, is there any question as to why this crystal is so popular? 9. SMOKY QUARTZ Smoky quartz is known for its grounding properties, because of its color and connection to the root chakra, but it is also believed to be an excellent stone for decluttering thoughts and preventing overthinking. No matter who you are, we all have thoughts that pass through our minds that are negative. We sometimes let these thoughts get to us, but incorporating smoky quartz into your everyday life may be the perfect way to let those thoughts go, and to assist in preventing them in the first place. Smoky quartz could be ideal for people who work in very stressful jobs, or for those who suffer from childhood trauma. "}
