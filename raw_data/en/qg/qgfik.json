Therefore, in the infectious disease area, many unmet medical ne eds still remain, including the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and new viral variants, as well as the aforementioned threats. Based on its Company Policy \"Shionogi strives constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect t he health and wellbeing of the patients we serve,\" Shionogi strives to be a company indispensable for society, meeting medical needs and providing solutions to social issues through its business activities, and to sharing the return from those efforts with its stakeholders. Shionogi is committed to \"Protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases\" as our key focus (issue of materiality). We are not only limiting ourselves to the research and development of therapeutic medications, but also a re focused on the total care of infectious diseases, through awareness -building, detection and forecasting, prevention, diagnosis, and treating exacerbations. As part of these initiatives, recognizing society's reinforced understanding of the importance of continual research activities in the infectious disease area and the need to prepare for possible future pandemics, Shionogi has concluded that, in addition to promoting in -house research and development and strengthening its collaborations with industry groups and partners, it is necessary to create a new framework to broadly support research on infectious diseases. As a result, it has decided to establish the Shionogi Infectious Disease Research Promotion Foundation, a General Incorporated Foundation (th e \"New Foundation\"), with the aim of supporting and promoting research on infectious diseases, which pose a threat to humankind, and thereby contributing to the promotion of science and to human health and welfare. The New Foundation will play a role in ac celerating efforts to resolve these social issues. Shionogi believes that these activities will contribute to the realization of the Shionogi Group's philosophy and lead to the sustainable growth of the Company and enhancement of corporate value over the m edium to long term. (2) Disposition of treasury stock In order to continuously and stably support the activities of the New Foundation, the Company will establish a third -party benefit trust (the \"Trust\") with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited as truste e, Custody Bank of Japan, Ltd. as re -trustee, and the New Foundation as beneficiary. The Trust will subscribe to purchase shares of the Company's stock. The Trust will pay trust proceeds earned from dividends, etc. on the Company's stock to the New Foundat ion, and the New Foundation will use trust proceeds to fund its activities. The disposition of treasury stock this time will be conducted for the Trust, which will be established to provide funds for social contribution activities of the New Foundation. (3) Reasonableness of the terms and conditions of disposition, etc. As the New Foundation will continuously and stably implement its activities, such as the provision of aid to organizations whose activities are in line with its objective s, the Company bel ieves that the number of shares to be disposed of is of an appropriate magnitude to fund the activities of the New Foundation. Moreover, as it is not currently expected, under the structure of the scheme of the Trust, that a large number of the treasury sh ares would be sold into the market after the disposition, and as the impact on the secondary market triggered by the disposition of treasury stock will be small, the Company believes that the number of shares to be disposed of is at a reasonable level. As the extent of dilution of the shares of the Company's stock triggered by the disposition of treasury stock is small, representing 0.96% (rounded to the second decimal place; 1.00% against the aggregate number of voting rights of 3,010,818) of the total num ber of issued shares, the Company believes that the impact on the stock market triggered by the disposition of treasury stock will be small. Furthermore, Custody Bank of Japan, Ltd. shall not exercise its voting rights on the shares that the Trust will acquire upon disposition of the treasury stock throughout the term of the T rust. The Company believes that the price of disposition of 1 yen per share is reasonable for the above -mentioned effect and purpose, and hereby asks for approval for delegation of the determination of the subscription requirements to the Board of Directors with regard to disposition of treasury stock by way of third -party allotment in accordance with Article 199 (Determination of Subscription Requirements) and Article 200 (Delegation o f Determination of Subscription Requirements) of the Companies Act. Incidentally, at a meeting held on May 11, 2022, the Board of Directors resolved to acquire treasury stock (up to 7.2 million shares or 50 billion yen) pursuant to the provisions of Artic le 156 of the Companies Act, applied by replacing terms pursuant to the provisions of Article 165, paragraph 3 of the same Act, and to cancel treasury stock (4.2 million shares) pursuant to the provisions of Article 178 of the same Act, which is subject to approval of this Proposal. - 21 - <Details of treasury stock to be disposed of> (i) Type of shares to be disposed of and the upper limit of disposition 3,000,000 shares of common stock (0.96%* of the total number of issued shares) (ii) Minimum amount to be paid in 1 yen per share (iii) Total amount to be paid in 3,000,000 yen (iv) Method of disposition Disposition by way of third -party allotment (v) Subscriber Custody Bank of Japan, Ltd.

Current State of the Shionogi Group (1) Recognition of social and customer issues in the mid - and long -term and the Medium -Term Business Plan STS2030 Social Issues to be Tac kled by the Shionogi Group Shionogi has identified three social issues on which we will focus in order for Shionogi to grow together with society in an environment surrounding the increasingly ever -changing pharmaceutical industry: \"Protecting people from the threat of infectious diseases,\" \"Improving social productivity and extending healthy lifespans,\" and \"Contribut ing to sustainable social security.\" Through the implementation of the Medium -Term Business Plan STS2030, we will make group -wide efforts to solve these social issues. Appended documents 1 - 23 - 2030 Vision and Medium -Term Business Plan STS2030 The Group has formulated the \"2030 Vision,\" which envisages what we want to achieve by 2030, and also identified social issues the Group should tackle by analyzing the external environment from various perspectives as mentioned above. On that basis, in June 20 20, we developed the New Medium -Term Business Plan \"Shionogi Transformation Strategy 2030 (STS2030)\" as a strategy to achieve the 2030 Vision while solving the social issues . Defining the period from FY2020 to FY2024 as STS Phase 1, the entire Group will w ork together to vi gorously push forward with changes in business and realize our \"Transformation.\" The fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, was the second year of STS Phase 1, which was a year in which we focused on activities to provide therapeutic medicines , vaccines and diagnostic agents so that the people in Japan and across the world can regain their daily lives as soon as possible amid the continuing COVID -19 pandemic, as well as renewing our recognition of the importance of initiatives to tackle the issues of infectious diseases. Initiatives for providing services beyond the conventional therap eutic framework also moved forward significantly. As a leading company in the area of infectious diseases, we place utmost priority on working to realize total care for COVID -19, which includes epidemic forecasting, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and suppression of exacerbation. This represents a model for connecting each section of the value chain, which is the key to becoming a HaaS* company whose services extend beyond the provision of prescription medicines. We will aim to become a HaaS company by extending the model to areas other than infectious diseases. * Healthcare as a Service: To provide not only pharmaceuticals but also various healthcare services according to customer nee ds. 2 - 24 - (2) Business Operations and Results Summary of Co nsolidated Result s Overview of Business (IFRS *) Summary of consolidated statement of income for FY202 1 FY20 20 FY202 1 YoY (%) Revenue (\u00a5 in 100 million) 2,972 3,351 12.8 Operating profit (\u00a5 in 100 million) 1,174 1,103 (6.1) Core operating profit ** (\u00a5 in 100 million) 940 1,106 17.7 Profit before tax (\u00a5 in 100 million) 1,430 1,263 (11.7) Profit attributable to owners of parent (\u00a5 in 100 million) 1,119 1,142 2.1 * IFRS: International Financial Reporting Standards **Core operating profit: Operating profit adjusted for non -recurring items (e.g. impairment loss, gain on sales of property, plant and equipment) Revenue was \u00a5335.1 billion (up 12.8% year -on-year). Dom estic revenue of prescription drugs was \u00a589.1 billion (down 5.9% year -on-year) due to the impact of the entry of generic versions of Cymbalta. Meanwhile, revenue of overseas subsidiaries/export business was \u00a534.4 billion (up 39.5% year -on-year) due to an i ncrease in sales of Cefiderocol in the US and Europe. Royalty income was \u00a5181.3 billion (up 25.3% year -on-year), reflecting an increase in royalty income on HIV franchise. Operating profit was \u00a5110.3 billion (down 6.1% year -on-year) due to an increase in R&D investment on the back of aggressive investments in a COVID -19-related project. Core operating profit, excluding these special factors, was \u00a5110.6 billion (up 17.7% year -on-year).Profit before tax was \u00a5126.3 billion (down 11.7% year -on- year).Profit att ributable to owners of parent was \u00a5114.2 billion (up 2.1% year -on-year) as a result of receiving a refund in relation to the successful lawsuit requesting revocation of a reassessment of income taxes by the Osaka Regional Taxation Bureau, despite a decreas e in profit before tax. Durin g the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we were able to achieve our earnings forecast despite a significant rise in R&D costs for a COVID -19-related project. In the next fiscal year, we will address the issues that remain unsol ved and further strengt hen our efforts in transformation to realize a corporate structure that can generate profits on its own. Overview of Assets, etc. (IFRS) Items of consolidated statement of financial position End of FY20 20 End of FY202 1 YoY (%) Total assets (\u00a5 in 100 million) 9,990 11,506 15.2 Total equity (\u00a5 in 100 million) 8,646 9,933 14.9 Total liabilities (\u00a5 in 100 million) 1,344 1,573 17.0 1 - 25 - Consolidated Results: Royalties and dividend income from ViiV Robust royalty and dividend income Royalty income from UK -based ViiV Healthcare Ltd. (\"ViiV\"), excluding one -time income, increased year -on-year due to the growth of sales of HIV franchise out -licensed to ViiV. Since ViiV's patent infringement suit against US -based Gilead Sciences, Inc. (\"Gilead\") reached a settlement during FY2021, ViiV will receive a one -time payment of 1.25 billion US dollars and a 3% royalty on future sales of Biktarvy in the US (reference: sales were 6.09 billion US dollars in 2020) and on the bictegravir portion of future product sales. The Company recorded a portion of the one -time payment received by ViiV as revenue. Following discussions with ViiV, the Company also recorded an amount equivalent to royalty to be received in the future as revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. As a result of the above, royalty income from ViiV amounted to \u00a5174.0 billion (up 41.0% year -on-year). Dividend income f rom ViiV was \u00a513.0 billion (down 44.5% year-on-year) due to the impact of the delay in receipt of the amount for the fourth quarter of FY2021 to FY2022. Royalty income from Swiss -based Roche was \u00a540 million in the fiscal year ended March 31 , 2022, a s the i nfluenza season continued to be extremely mild globally. Royalties on Crestor from UK -based AstraZeneca amounted to 1. 2 billion yen (down 93.1% year -on-year) as the amount received from the company decreased from the fourth quarter of FY2020 in accordance with the contract. As described above, the sum of royalty, milestone and dividend income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, amounted to \u00a5194.2 billion (up 15.6% year -on-year) on the back of an increase in royalty income from the HIV franchise. Further QOL* improvement through long -acting drug Cabenuva and prevention drug Apretude Approval of additional indication for a bimonthly administration of Cabenuva, a long -acting injectable HIV treatment which includes cabotegravir discovered by the Shionogi Group, was obtained in the US. This is expected to further improve the QOL of patients, as the number of days of administration decreases from 12 times a year to six times. In addition, the cabotegravir single -agent, long-acting HIV prevention drug Apretude was approved in the US. Since Apretude indicates greater preventive effects for only six administrations a year than existing prevention drugs that require daily administration, it is expected to become an importan t choice in HIV prevention. *QOL: Quality of life 2 - 26 - Domestic/Overseas Business Progress of the domestic business Domestic revenue from prescription drugs was \u00a589.1 billion (down 5.9% year -on-year) as a result of a decline in sales due to the entry of generic versions of Cymbalta. Revenue from influenza -related products was \u00a53.1 billion (an increase of \u00a52.8 billion year -on-year) due to the recording of revenue from government reserves of Rapiacta, although the outbreak of influ enza remained extremely small as in the previous season. Revenue from anti -infection drugs, including influenza -related products, was \u00a511.8 billion (up 20.8% year -on-year). Revenue from Intuniv and Vyvanse grew to \u00a516.4 billion (up 25.4% year -on-year) and \u00a50.8 billion (up 190.7% year - on-year), respectively. Although MRs were restricted from visiting medical institutions due to the COVID -19 pandemic, we continued to focus on developing a system for providing information in a digital environment and securing opportunities to meet them in order to deliver information on each product to medical professionals even under such circumstances. With the aim of improving productivity per person, we also promoted the establishment of a sales IT platform in order to create an organization in which decisions are made based on data. Progress of the US/Europe business: Increase in sales of cefiderocol* Revenue in the US increased 84.5% year on year to 13.8 billion yen due to good performance of cefiderocol and as a result of the receipt of one -time payment related to transfer of sales rights for FORTAMET. Among the revenue, sales of cefiderocol totaled 6.2 billion yen (up 268.7% year on year). Revenue in the Europe increased 153.7% year on year to 5.0 billion yen due to good performance of cefiderocol. In FY2021, the Company started sales of cefiderocol in Italy**. We will continue to be committed to grow the US/Europe business by increasing the number of countries where Cefiderocol is sold and the number of countries that adopt a subscription -type reimbursement model***. * Brand name in the US: Fetroja, Brand name in Europe: Fetcroja ** Countries in which the Company has begun sales by FY2021: US, UK, Italy, Austria, Sweden, Germany, France *** A reimbursement model which de -links payment from volume of use of antibiotics and under which the government pays a fixed amount of payment to t he company that developed them for access to them whenever needed. Progress of the China business A year has passed since the establishment of Ping An -Shionogi in November 2020. Revenue ended at \u00a510.2 billion (up 1.1% year -on-year) due to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, although revenue of the existing generic business decreased amid the Chinese government's measures to curb medical costs. We are accelerating preparations for clinical trials of Cefiderocol and naldemedine, an opioid -induced co nstipation treatment, toward their quickest launch in China. In drug discovery, for specified diseases in the field of central nervous system, we explored candidate compounds that could act widely on target genes using AI technology. As a result, we managed to narrow down promising candidates. We will continue to shape the future of healthcare in China and Southeast Asia by combining expertise in R&D based on science, manufacturing and quality control with expertise in big data collection and AI analy sis based on information technology. 3 - 27 - Research and Development: Research Results of Research In the current fiscal year, Shionogi continued to make progress on our priority projects almost as planned by making active investments in research and development and appropriately addressing the changing environment caused by COVID -19.

Application for production and marketing approval in Japan (February 25, 2022) Having completed the analysis on the primary endpoints of the Phase 2b portion of the Phase 2/3 trials, Shionogi applied for approval of production and marketing requesting application of the conditional approval system based on data on preclinical and clinical trials and manufacture and CMC. At the end of March, Shionogi signed an MOU with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare toward domestic supply and is ca rrying out discussions for supplying 1 million doses promptly after the approval as well as a certain amount thereafter. We are conducting the Phase 3 portion of the Phase 2/3 trials targeting mild and moderate COVID -19 patients, or the Phase 2b/3 portion targeting people infected with SARS -CoV -2 who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms only. Global phase 3 trials with the support of NIH* in preparation Globally, Shionogi prepared ACTIV -2d (SCORPIO -HR trials), a global Phase 3 trial, in conjunction with ACTG**. *National Institutes of Health **The AIDS Clinical Trial Group Commitment to COVID -19 vaccine development Shionogi is developing a recombinant protein vaccine that employs BEVS* owned by subsidiary UMN Pharma Inc. In order to provide a new vaccine option of an effective and safe domestic vaccine that can accommodate booster immunization, trials have progressed since the initiation of Phase 1/2 trials in August 2021, and the five final stage clinical trials including global placebo control trials have been carried out. In one of the five trials -the booster trial -, non -inferiority of the immunogenicity of S -268019 against COMIRNATY intramuscular injection (by Pfizer) was verified, and the primary endpoints were achieve d. To enable early commercialization, the production system is being established at the same time, with progress achieved in the establishment of a supply system. In the next fiscal year, we will proceed with stepping up the production system by launching another line. As for vaccine development, Shionogi is also engaged in the development of a nasal vaccine in collaboration with Chiba University Hospital and HanaVax Inc. Nasal vaccines not only enable effective immunity induction in the respiratory mucosa, which is the area that becomes infected, but also the entire body without hurting the body, and are attracting attention from the perspective of healthcare access as a formulation that can be administered easily anywhere. *BEVSBaculovirus Expression Ve ctor System - 33 - Topics Commitment to the novel coronavirus infectious disease ( 2) Commitment to understanding the infection situation and early epidemic forecasting with wastewater monitoring In April 2021, Shionogi launched a service for understanding the infection situation of the target community or facility by collecting the wastewater of wastewater treatment plants and facilities of local communities on a regular basis using a highly sensitive technology developed together with Hokkaido University that detects SARS -CoV -2 within wastewater. In January 2022, Shionogi and Shimadzu Corporation established AdvanSentinel Inc., a joint venture focused on public health risk assessment, including wastewater surveillance. The joint ve nture is accelerating its efforts to build an All -Japan system to detect the next pandemic and other public health risks, not only COVID -19, by combining the strengths and network of the two companies. AdvanSentinel has succeeded in detecting the stealth o micron variant strain from wastewater earlier than individual PCR test reports and in capturing the virus concentration in chronological order. It is expected to contribute to the understanding of the infection situation of SARS - CoV -2, including variant st rains, at an earlier stage. Commitment to the provision of COVID -19 diagnostic drugs and kits In partnership with Lumira Dx Japan Co., Ltd., Shionogi began joint sales of LumiraDX SARS -CoV -2 Ag Test Strip, a COVID -19 antigen test agent, and LumiraDX Diagnostic Instrument in Japan in May 2021. In partnership with TAUNS Laboratories, Inc., Shionogi commenced joint sales of Imunoace\u00ae SARS - CoV -2 , a COVID -19 antigen test kit, in Japan in November 2021. Furthermore, it commenced sales of HISCL\u00ae TARC reagent, a Th2 chemokine TARC kit that is a diagnosis marker that can predict patients with risk of exacerbation. Commitment to suppressing exacerbations of COVID -19 In partnership with US -based BioAge, Shionogi is working to develop asapiprant (S -555739), a prostaglandin D2 DP1 receptor antagonist discovered by Shionogi as a candidate treatment for preventing aggravation of COVID - 19. Asapiprant's high affinity and selectivity for DP1 receptor as well as high tolerance and safety have been confirmed in multiple preclinical trials and clinical trials in more than 2,400 patients that have been conducted by Shionogi. Phase 2 clinical trials in elderly patients are currently being implemented by BioAge in the US. - 34 - (3) Significant Subsidiaries Company Name Paid-in Capital Percentage of Ownership Main Areas of Business Shionogi Pharma Co., Ltd. 90 Million Yen 100.0 Manufacturing and contract manufactur e of pharmaceuticals products and contract t esting and analysis Shionogi Health care Co., Ltd. 10 Million Yen 51.0 OTC drug manufacturing and sales Shionogi Inc. 12 US dollars 100.0 Pharmaceutical clinical development and Pharmaceutical manufacturing and sale s Shionogi B.V. 630 Thousand UK Pounds 100.0 Pharmaceutical clinical development and Pharmaceutical manufacturing and sales Ping An -Shionogi (Hong Kong) Limited 361,794 Thousand HK dollars 51.0 Pharmaceutical sales Ping An -Shionogi Co., Ltd. 1,061,224 Thousand Chinese yuan 51.0 Pharmaceutical clinical development and Pharmaceutical manufacturing and sale s (4) Capital Investment The Shionogi Group's capital investment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 20 22 totaled 27.3 billion yen.

We will promptly address remaining challenges in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, achieve the business plan for FY2022, and at the same time, achieve the 2030 Vision which is the medium - to long -term targets, and aim at realization of society where people around the world live with peace of mind. In research and development, Shionogi managed to apply for approval of production and marketing of oral COVID -19 treatment S -217622 at t he end of February 2022 by flexibly responding to the external environment and changing the development plans amid the rapidly changing infection situation, surrounding environment and needs of society. In the development of a vaccine for which we had no b usiness experience, the R&D of S -268019 progressed at a speed significantly beyond the preconceived ideas of the Shionogi Group, such as reducing the time for decision -making and conducting multiple clinical trials simultaneously. Unfortunately, however, w e were not able to provide a therapeutic drug or vaccine that could contribute to society during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. In FY2022, we will accelerate on-going trials as well as make efforts to expand prevention and pediatric indications of t he therapeutic drug. We will also proceed significantly with the development of new growth drivers in order to overcome the drop in revenue due to the expiry of a patent for an anti -HIV drug (patent cliff) expected in around 2028, as we further advance the speed and decision -making that we have gained in the course of COVID -19-related projects . For COVID -19-related products for which we made up -front investment, we will realize early commercialization in Japan and abroad with the aim of securing revenue by maximizing product value. In our domestic business, revenue declined due to the entry of generic versions of Cymbalta and the extremely small outbreak of influenza. In order to achieve top -line growth, we will continue to maximize product value through a fusion of the real world and the digital world by employing IT and data, as well as vigorously in -licensing new products that will generate synergy with existing drugs and drugs in the pipeline. In our overseas business, we will begin full -scale discussions with the relevant parties toward rolling out the COVID -19 drug in the US, Europe and Asia, and the vaccine in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam. In the US and Europe, we will also continue to strengthen our sales system in the hospital area wit h a focus on Cefiderocol and increase the number of countries to which the subscription -type reimbursement model for Cefiderocol is applied. In the China business, we will focus on in -licensing new products to the online healthcare platform, re -establishin g the sales promotion system and increasing new sales channels. We will also work to realize early launch of new drugs and enhance research approaches using AI technology in order to create medium - to long -term value. With respect to investments in busine ss, we will reinvest our revenue gained from COVID -19-related projects and focus on efforts for medium - to long -term growth. We will build a sustainable business platform for infectious diseases and work to establish a system that can roll out infectious d isease drugs globally by ourselves by accelerating vaccine R&D, strengthening the supply chain and enhancing negotiating strength with external support organizations. Toward the goal of Shionogi's 2030 Vision: \"Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare,\" no Shionogi director or employee should fear change; instead we should welcome diversity and \"transform\" Shionogi so we are not bound by preconcei ved ideas. In this way, we will work to address ESG issues through our operations and contribute to the development of more sustainable society. We will continue to work hard to give shareholders a sense of the Shionogi Group's growth. - 36 - Topics Shion ogi's ESG Initiatives and Corporate Evaluation from Outside Received A - Rating in the Field of Climate Change and the Field of Water Security from CDP ( December 2021) and Selected as Supplier Engagement Leaderboard in the Field of Climate Change for the Second Consecutive Year (February 2022) Shionogi received high ratings A - in the field of \"Climate Change\" and the field of \"Water Security,\" following the previous year from CDP, an international non -profit organization running the global environme ntal disclosure system.

It encompasses base monthly remuneration, performance -linked bonuses determined by results for the fiscal year and other factors, and restricted stock compensation (medium -term perfor mance -linked and long -term) introduced in FY2018. Outside directors only receive base remuneration. Base remuneration is determined according to the position and responsibilities of directors with due consideration of the operating environment and social t rends. Bonuses are short -term incentives paid as cash remuneration which reflects performance indicators (core operating profit, consolidated profit and other total performance evaluation as directors excluding sales of assets, etc.) to heighten the awaren ess of improving performance for each fiscal year, which are determined according to performance such as achievement of targeted profits and other factors in each fiscal year based on a calculation matrix and paid in June of each year. The results of perfo rmance indicators for the current fiscal year are as described in \"1. Overview of Operations (2) Business Operations and Results.\" Stock -based compensation is awarded in July of each year based on a grant table according to the director's position and role . For medium -term performance -linked stock compensation, in particular, for the portion to be granted in three years between FY2020 and FY2022 out of the period of STS2030 Phase 1 (from FY2020 to FY2024), performance is evaluated based on the degree of ach ievement in FY2022 using revenue, overseas net sales, core operating profit, ROI and the rank in total shareholder return (TSR) among 12 competitors including the Company (relative TSR) as quantitative indicators and in consideration of the status of ESG, compliance and development associated with COVID -19. And then the ratio of lifting the transfer restriction (between 100% and 0%) is determined. In addition, when lifting the transfer restriction, 50% of the amount of stock -based compensation is paid as mo netary compensation calculated by stock price translation at the time of the lifting.

Note: Performance -linked remuneration, etc. i s directors' bonuses and non -monetary remuneration, etc. is restricted stock.
