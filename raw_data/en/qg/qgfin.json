For protection against seasonal influenza infection, an annual vaccination is highly recommended by World Health Organization. Inactivated split influenza vaccine (Flu-shot) is the most common platform used for vaccination but its immunogenicity and efficacy need to be improved ( [2](#B2) [3](#B3)). [4](#B4)). The innate immune response of TLR signaling plays a critical role in dictating the quality and magnitude of the adaptive immune responses ( [5](#B5) [6](#B6)). The presence of specific TLR agonists or their combinations in vaccine formulations directs the magnitude and type of immune responses ( [7](#B7)). The live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine, being used for 80 years, was shown to contain TLR2, TLR7/8, and TLR9 activating signals ( [8](#B8)). TLR2 and TLR4 ( [9](#B9)). AS04 adjuvant which is a combination of aluminum hydroxide and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) has been licensed to be a part of the hepatitis B vaccine (Fendrix\u00ae; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) ( papilloma virus vaccine (Cervarix\u00ae; GlaxoSmithKline) ( [11](#B11)). These studies provide rationale for developing vaccines with adjuvants engaging in multiple signaling pathways. [12](#B12)). Unmethylated oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs have been utilized as a potent adjuvant biasing T helper type 1 (Th1) immune responses ( [13](#B13) [14](#B14)). The inclusion of CpG in conventional oil in water emulsion adjuvants was shown to change the Th2 bias toward balanced or Th1-type response ( [15](#B15)). CpG has been tested as an immunotherapeutic adjuvant in humans ( [16](#B16)). MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and reagents In vitro stimulation assays of DCs Immunization and virus infection ELISA for antibody and cytokine levels Lung virus titration [17](#B17)). Flow cytometry [18](#B18)). Golgi-stop (monensin, a protein transport inhibitor) was added to each sample during the stimulation. For intracellular cytokine staining, Fixation/Permeabilization solution kit (BD biosciences) was used by following the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical analysis RESULTS Combination of MPL and CpG enhances DC activation and cytokine production [Fig. 1](#F1)). The immature DCs were harvested and then cultured with different dose combinations of MPL, CpG, or MPL+CpG. After 2-day culture, \u00b5g/ml) or CpG (0-4 \u00b5g/ml) alone in a range tested was not effective in stimulating DCs to secrete IL-12p70 showed stimulating DCs to secrete IL-12. These synergistic effects were suppressed or not observed with a high concentration (5 \u00b5g/ml) of MPL ( [Fig. 1A](#F1)). Both MPL and CpG either alone effectively stimulated DCs to secrete IL-6 ( [Fig. 1B](#F1)). Either MPL alone stimulated DCs to secrete inflammatory cytokine TNF- at a moderate level regardless of concentrations whereas combinations showed additive effects ( [Fig. 1C](#F1)). [Fig. 1D the expression of CD40 and CD86 than CpG whereas levels of CD80 were similarly high in all stimulated DCs ( [Fig. 1D-F](#F1)). Overall, compared to individual MPL or CpG, combination of MPL and CpG appears to be more effective in stimulating DCs particularly in IL-12 and TNF- production as well as CD40 and CD86 marker expressions. DCs with combination MPL and CpG treatment are effective in activating T cells [19](#B19)). To determine the antigen presentation and activation ability of DCs to T cells, CFSE-labeled allogeneic lymphocytes (from C57BL/6 mice) were co-cultured with (from BALB/c mice) that were pre-treated with MPL, CpG or MPL+CpG. After 5-day co-culture, the cell proliferation (CFSE negative) and cytokine productions of T cells were measured by flow cytometry ( [Fig. 2](#F2)). MPL only and MPL+CpG pre-treated DC showed similarly higher levels of CD4 T cell proliferation than CpG alone treatment ( [Fig. 2A](#F2)). Combination of MPL+CpG pre-treated DCs showed the highest levels of CD8 T cell proliferation, and IFN- producing CD4 and CD8 T cells meanwhile MPL or CpG single adjuvant treated DCs showed moderate effects ( [Fig. 2B-D](#F2)). MPL alone or MPL+CpG combination treated DCs showed low to moderate effects on activating CD4 and CD8 T cells to secrete IL-4 but higher than those in DC controls ( [Fig. 2E and F](#F2)). These results suggest that combination MPL+CpG stimulated DCs effectively proliferate T cells to secrete IFN-. Combination MPL and CpG adjuvants enhance IgG antibody responses to influenza vaccine [Fig. 3A and C](#F3)). The MPL or CpG single adjuvanted groups showed similarly higher IgG levels than the sPR8 vaccine alone group ( [Fig. 3A](#F3)). Interestingly, the sPR8+MPL group induced the highest levels of IgG1 isotype antibodies whereas CpG showed more effective adjuvant effects on enhancing IgG2a isotype antibodies than MPL ( [Fig. 3B and C](#F3)). IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were observed in the CpG and MPL+CpG combination groups compared to the MPL or sPR8 vaccine alone group ( [Fig. 3D](#F3)). Both MPL and CpG adjuvants enhance protective of influenza vaccination [Fig. 4A and B](#F4)). The sPR8 vaccine alone group showed moderate but significant BW loss and increases in PenH. The combination MPL+CpG group was well protected against A/PR8 challenge as evidenced by no changes in BW and in PenH, similar to na\u00efve uninfected mice ( [Fig. 4A and B](#F4)). The MPL and CpG alone adjuvant groups displayed a transiently slight loss (3%-7%) in BW but recovered back to normal weight and there were no significant differences among the adjuvanted groups. [Fig. 4C and D](#F4)). The na\u00efve infection group showed the highest levels of lung viral titers (10 Log10) and severe histopathology with infiltrates. Also, the sPR8 vaccine group exhibited significant lung viral loads and thickening of airway epithelial layers in the histology despite lower than those in na\u00efve infection mice. The adjuvanted vaccine groups showed significantly lower levels of virus titers near to the detection limit. Little thickening of airway epithelial layers was observed in the histology of the CpG group ( [Fig. 4C and D](#F4)). These data support that MPL and CpG adjuvants in single dose vaccination enhance protective efficacy of sPR8 vaccine. Combination MPL and CpG adjuvanted vaccination prevents inflammatory innate immune responses due to virus infection [Fig. 5](#F5)) and analyzed lung cell populations ( [Fig. 6](#F6)). The na\u00efve infection group showed the highest inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IFN-) and chemokines (MCP-1, RANTES, KC, and IP-10). The sPR8 vaccine alone IL-10, TNF-, IFN-, MCP-1, the adjuvanted vaccine groups ( [Fig. 5](#F5)). The single adjuvant MPL and CpG groups displayed substantial levels of cytokines (IL-1, IL-10, and IFN-) and chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES) compared to the combination MPL+CpG group which is almost free of inflammation similar to na\u00efve uninfected mice ( [Fig. 5](#F5)). [Fig. 6A](#F6)). The alveolar macrophage (AM) is the first defense cell in the airways. AM populations were significantly reduced in the na\u00efve infection group whereas the vaccinated groups showed similar or higher numbers of AM than the na\u00efve infection group ( [Fig. 6B](#F6)). Higher numbers of monocytes and neutrophils were recruited by influenza virus infection in the na\u00efve infection and sPR8 only vaccinated groups than the adjuvanted groups ( [Fig. 6C and D](#F6)). Especially, the of neutrophils, plasmacytoid DCs, CD103+ resident DCs, the CpG group ( [Fig. 6C-G](#F6)). These results suggest that combination MPL+CpG adjuvanted vaccination more effectively prevents the induction of inflammatory cytokines and cellular infiltrates into the lungs due to influenza virus infection. MPL and CpG combination adjuvanted vaccination does not induce inflammatory T cells due to influenza virus infection in the airways and lungs [Fig. 7A and B](#F7)) and GzB+ CD8 T cells in lungs ( [Fig. 7C](#F7)) at day 7 post infection compared to the adjuvanted vaccine groups. The na\u00efve and sPR8 vaccine groups induced CD4 and CD8 T cells secreting TNF- and IFN- in the BAL at higher levels adjuvanted vaccination after infection ( [Fig. 7D-G](#F7)). TNF- secreting lung CD4 and CD8 T cells were induced at the highest level in the CpG group among the groups ( [Fig. 7H and I](#F7)). IFN- producing CD4 and CD8 T cells were detected in the lungs from the CpG adjuvant and sPR8 vaccine alone groups compared to those in the na\u00efve, MPL adjuvant, and combination MPL+CpG groups and K](#F7)). Interestingly, GzB+, TNF-, and IFN- expressing T cells were at the lowest levels in the BAL and lung samples from the combination MPL+CpG and MPL adjuvant groups ( splenocytes [Fig. 8](#F8)). In contrast to the local sites of virus infected lungs, spleen cells from na\u00efve, na\u00efve mice with infection, and sPR8 vaccinated mice did not produce meaningful levels of IFN- and TNF-. Splenocytes from MPL or CpG single secreted levels of IFN- and TNF- cytokines. Notably, the MPL+CpG combination group induced significant levels of both IFN- and TNF- cytokines in spleen cell cultures ( [Fig. 8A and B](#F8)). DISCUSSION [20](#B20)). Differential outcomes of in vitro DC stimulation and combination MPL+CpG effects might be due to a difference in the signaling pathway of MPL and CpG. Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing IFN- (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) are known to be partially involved in the TLR4 ligand signaling in addition to MyD88 ( [21](#B21) [22](#B22)). The TLR9 CpG signaling pathway is the MyD88 adaptor molecule ( [23](#B23)). (5-100 \u00b5g) of MPL were applied to enhance the efficacy of vaccines ( [24](#B24) [26](#B26) [27](#B27) [28](#B28)). Thus, the dose of 1 \u00b5g MPL and 4 \u00b5g CpG is in a low range compared to those used in previous studies. In vivo adjuvant effects appeared to be dose dependent since 4 \u00b5g dose of MPL resulted in higher IgG antibodies after vaccination of C57BL/6 mice than those in 1 \u00b5g MPL, and combination MPL+CpG adjuvant effects were prominent (data not shown). We have not observed any abnormal reactions on the site of vaccination. The assessment of safety and side effects of vaccines and adjuvants is limited in preclinical animal studies, and should be carried out in the phase I clinical studies. Although MPL increased total IgG antibodies to sPR8 vaccine, IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were similar to those in the sPR8 vaccine only group whereas CpG and MPL+CpG adjuvanted groups induced higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratios, suggesting that CpG is a main adjuvant biasing a Th1 pattern of IgG2a immune responses to inactivated split influenza vaccine in BALB/c mice. CpG in combination with conventional oil-based adjuvants was shown to enhance adjuvants was shown to enhance CD8 T cell responses to DNA vaccines ( [30](#B30)). [31](#B31)). AMs were also known to release inflammatory cytokines to control viral replication ( [32](#B32) [33](#B33)). In response to inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, innate inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and DCs are recruited to the sites of viral infection. Thus, the percentages of the AMs are decreased as well during the infection. Therefore, na\u00efve mice after influenza virus infection showed the lowest numbers of AMs. In contrast, the mice with adjuvanted vaccination maintained or increased the levels of AMs in lungs after influenza virus infection. [34](#B34) [35](#B35)). Na\u00efve infection or sPR8 vaccine alone immune mice exhibited high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and infiltrates of innate cells and lymphocytes into the lungs. These data indicate severe inflammatory disease due to virus infection and suggest insufficient protection by a single dose sPR8 vaccination. For effective protection, 2-time (prime and boost) influenza vaccination is recommended in na\u00efve individuals. The strong adaptive immune development (IgG antibodies) was developed even by single vaccination with MPL+CpG adjuvant, the replication of influenza virus was well controlled in the MPL+CpG adjuvanted mice so that there was no BW loss, lung inflammation and cytokine production as well as inflammatory innate cellular infiltration. This complete protection might be resulted from high levels of antigen-specific antibodies by MPL+CpG adjuvant combination. In contrast, the sPR8 vaccine only group or unvaccinated mice showed high levels of inflammatory cytokines and cellular infiltration, which is because of ineffective control of influenza virus replication. [36](#B36)). Effector T cells produce excess cytokines and chemokines contributing to cytotoxic activity of damaging the tissue, although the primary role of which is to eliminate infected epithelial cells ( [37](#B37) [38](#B38)). In the intracellular staining and flow cytometry analysis of BAL and lung cells post infection, we observed that high levels of GzB+ CD4 and CD8 T cells in BAL and lung samples were induced at high levels in na\u00efve mice with infection and in sPR8 alone immune mice. Also, relatively high levels of TNF-+ and IFN-+ BAL CD4 and CD8 T cells were detected in sPR8 vaccine and na\u00efve infection mice. The high levels of GzB+ effector T cells in the airway are correlated with lung viral loads. Previous studies demonstrated that effector T cells with cytotoxic function are located in the airways (BAL) from na\u00efve infection or sPR8 vaccine alone mice. Both GzB+ and TNF-+ CD4 and CD8 T cells can cells ( [37](#B37) [38](#B38) [39](#B39) [40](#B40)). The CpG adjuvanted mice induced a substantial level of GzB+ CD8 T cells and the highest levels of TNF-+ and IFN-+ CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs post infection. These results suggest that CpG adjuvant effectively primes cytotoxic T cells being recruited into the lungs upon infection. Excess cytotoxic T cells may also contribute to tissue damage as a low to moderate level of weight loss was observed in the CpG adjuvanted vaccine group. Inactivated respiratory syncytial virus vaccine with CpG adjuvant was reported to enhance pulmonary pathology of alveolitis and interstitial pneumonitis after virus challenge of CpG adjuvant vaccinated mice ( [25](#B25)). Mice with combination MPL+CpG adjuvant was found to prevent inflammatory cytokines and innate immune cell infiltrates due to influenza virus infection in lungs, similar to na\u00efve uninfected mice.
