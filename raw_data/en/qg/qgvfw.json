I'm still me - here for you 2What you've just heard can also be overwhelming. There's a lot to take in, which is why it's so important that you have access to the facts. Quite simply, the more you understand about your kind of cancer, from the way it works to the treatment available, the more confident you'll feel about facing it head on. Knowledge is power, after all. By getting to grips with what's going on you can play an active role in tackling this illness and even taking control.Right now, whatever you're feeling is fine. From shock and disbelief to confusion, fear or just a sense of unreality, it's a perfectly natural response to being diagnosed with cancer. And yet no matter what's going through your mind, you don't have to deal with this alone. From medical staff to friends and family, chances are you're about to be offered more support, care and understanding than you've ever experienced before. People want to help, both in and out of hospital. All you have to do now is let them into your life.1. I'm still me - here for help 3 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00'My outlook on life has changed a lot throughout my illness. I've become a much stronger and more positive person. I enjoy helping others a lot more - I'm actually at college now, studying to be a counsellor. I want to support teenagers who have had serious illnesses because I understand what they're going through.' Laura, 21You may not feel like reading this booklet from cover to cover, which is why it's been designed so you can pick out the issues relevant to you. At different times throughout your illness, you'll be able to find all the information you need, plus blank pages for you to claim as your own. You might want to use them to make notes, record your experience, or jot down questions on your mind. Fill it as you wish, because putting things into words can only help you better understand what's on your mind. The first section takes you through the different stages of your illness, from the discovery that you have cancer to going into hospital, having tests and receiving treatment. You'll find each chapter packed with facts, advice and coping strategies, as well as insights from young people who have tackled cancer and become wiser for the experience.The second section explores the impact cancer can have on the way you feel about yourself, and your relationships with other people. We all know it's good to talk. So, the aim here is to encourage you to be open and honest about your feelings with yourself as much as with those who care for you. To make things even easier, you'll find a glossary at the back that covers all the medical terms and phrases you're likely to come across, and we've marked them in italics throughout the text. We've also included a contacts section, for you, your family or carers, listing organisations that can provide further advice or practical help. 1.

These keep going through a process of death and renewal. Cells become worn out and die but new cells are being formed all the time by a process called cell division . This is when a living cell splits up and divides itself into two new cells. The process is controlled by our genes. They make sure new cells are made at exactly the right rate to replace the old ones. A cancer develops when something goes wrong with the body's normal process of cell division . A cell changes so that it becomes wrong or abnormal. This means that when it divides it takes the 'wrong' blueprint, so you get more and more abnormal cells. These can start growing out of control, producing far more abnormal cells than the body actually needs. If this process starts in a blood cell, it can cause a problem in the blood (called leukaemia) or in the lymph gland (called lymphoma ). If abnormal cells start growing out of control in a bone or an organ (such as the kidney or brain) then they form a lump, or tumour . As cancer cells no longer follow your genetic blueprint, they don't know when to stop multiplying. As a result, the cancer carries on growing. It may also spread to other parts of the body and this is why it's important to have treatment as soon as possible. Cancer isn't just one disease. There are over 200 different kinds of cancer. Some are more common in women than men or vice versa. Some tend to be more common later in life, while others can affect mainly young people. 'I didn't really know anything about cancer before I got leukaemia. I remember reading a real-life story in a magazine once about a teenage girl who got cancer, which was really upsetting, but I never once considered that cancer was something that could happen to me.' Laura, 21 2. What is cancer? Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 002. What is cancer? 8'When I was diagnosed with cancer, it seemed so unfair. I wanted to know why it had happened to me. Of course, there was nothing the doctors could say to this. I just had to accept it.' Dan, 20About one in three people will have cancer at some point in their lives. Even so, it's still a very rare disease in young people. Each year, just 2,200 cases are diagnosed in the UK among 13-24 year olds. Cancer isn't a disease that you can catch from another person. It isn't infectious, nor anybody's fault. Many young people worry that their condition is somehow linked to their lifestyle, such as smoking, drinking or experimenting with drugs. We all know a smoking habit is linked to cancer, but it's very unlikely to be a cause in your early teens or twenties. At this age, developing cancer is just something that can happen without explanation. It's natural to search for reasons, or find ways to blame yourself for not foreseeing that it would happen. In every case, the important thing is to look ahead - which is why it helps to open up about what's on your mind. Above all, people who understand about cancer will recognise that you may be feeling confused, angry or scared. Your nurse, doctor, social worker or other health professional can always provide a listening ear. If you'd prefer to speak to someone over the phone, call Macmillan for support, help and advice.

Today, there are all sorts of new and successful treatments. Even though many forms of cancer are completely curable, it's still something we don't talk about openly. Some people are scared by it, while others don't even like saying the word. So being told that you have cancer is bound to be a great shock. Doctors carry out a range of tests to make their diagnosis . Their aim is to find out as much as possible about what's wrong with you. They'll want to pinpoint the exact type of disease and how far it has developed or spread. This can involve a lot of waiting for appointments and results. Sometimes it can seem as though it's going on for so long that you begin to lose touch with your normal life. If you feel well enough, aim to carry on with things you enjoy, whether it's sport, going to the cinema, surfing the net or just talking to friends on the phone. You may wonder what to say to people. Telling the truth might be tough, but you have nothing to hide. Basically, you're waiting for tests and results while trying to get on with life as normal.3. Discovering you have cancer 11 'I think I was pretty ignorant about cancer before I was diagnosed with it. I remember seeing stuff on TV about it and thinking: \"Oh God, that's depressing,\" and switching channels. After I was diagnosed, I felt a bit guilty for not having paid as much attention to issues relating to cancer previously. Nobody really talks about cancer. It's the \"C\" word that people are afraid to mention.' Jonathan, 23 Waiting and worrying Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00If you're at school or college it's a good idea for you (or your parent/s or carer) to talk to staff about your situation. If you're concerned about your health it can be hard to perform well in coursework or exams, so your teachers need to know what's happening. If you're at work you may feel hesitant about telling your employer. Again, it's better to be honest at this stage, especially if you need to take time off for hospital appointments. Whether you're in education or employment, you can always call upon a specialist nurse or social worker if you need help to explain your situation. See the A-Z of who does what on page 23.3. Discovering you have cancer 12'At first, the doctors thought I might be epileptic. Apart from having seizures, there was no other indication I was ill - although I did sleep a lot. As I was living in Spain at the time, I just thought I was getting into the culture by having lots of afternoon siestas. I never thought it could be a symptom of a brain tumour . 'The thing is, being diagnosed with the tumour was fine for me; it just didn't really feel like it was happening to me, probably because I felt healthy. The worst bit was waiting to see how the doctors would decide on treatment. They didn't know if it was cancerous at first, but they said that either way it was quite big and would be dangerous if it didn't come out soon.' Rochelle, 21 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 003. Discovering you have cancer 13'My GP sent me for a scan when a lump on my leg grew to the size of a golf ball. I was a bit scared; nobody had mentioned cancer, and it never even crossed my mind that it could be cancer. Afterwards, my dad took a phone call saying I needed to go and see a sarcoma specialist - he had an idea then that something serious was wrong, but he didn't tell me this because he didn't want to worry me.' 'The specialist said the lump was malignant , but I didn't know what that meant. It wasn't until I heard the word tumour that I twigged what he meant. My mum and dad were with me throughout and were really supportive. The doctors and nurses also turned out to be really helpful when it came to helping me understand what was going on.' Gemma, 19Tests and diagnosis or visit macmillan.org.uk3. Discovering you have cancer 14'I was 15 when I found out I had leukaemia. The doctors took me into a little side room where they told me. My brother was waiting outside, so straight afterwards I went and told him. We started crying together. We were really scared, but knew we just had to get on with it.' Laura, 21 How does it feel to learn you have cancer? It always helps if you understand why tests are being done and exactly what they will involve. Hospital staff should explain all this, but if in doubt, ask. And if you don't understand, ask again! If you think a test may be uncomfortable, don't be afraid to ask whether there's anything that can be done to make it easier. This kind of help is usually offered at the time the test is arranged. Of course, sometimes hospital staff can be very busy or may not realise how anxious you are. Just don't hesitate to speak up, even if it feels awkward. They'll understand what you're going through, and will do everything they can to help with your concerns. When test results come through, you can ask to see the scans or x-rays. This will help you to understand where your tumour or problem is. You could even ask your doctor to draw you a picture or diagram so that you can get a better idea of what's happening in your body. Ultimately, it's much easier to feel positive when you know what you're up against. Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00They aim to make any discomfort tolerable, so that you can carry on with as many of your usual activities as possible. You may also come into contact with other teams dedicated to supporting you through this time, from nutritional teams to activity coordinators, social workers and youth workers. Other specialist teams may also be available to you, depending on your type of cancer. Whatever your experience, they'll be united in making this as easy and as comfortable for you as they can. Talking about your feelings with an experienced listener can be useful. Sometimes it's hard to be open with the people closest to you (you may be scared of upsetting or frightening them with your feelings). So, if it feels easier for you, talk to a doctor, nurse or any member of the team dedicated to caring for you. Alternatively, you can always contact Macmillan. 3. Discovering you have cancer 15Receiving news like this is never easy. Above all, it can be hard to take in everything you're told. This is why it helps to have someone you trust with you, such as a family member or close friend, who can provide support and a chance to talk things through. Some individuals wrongly assume that getting cancer means you're going to die. The fact is, the number of people who are successfully treated and cured is on the rise. This is because doctors are discovering so much more about cancer and how it can be overcome. What's more, a great deal is now known about how to reduce the effects cancer has on the body, which gives you every chance to continue making the most out of life. Everyone is scared of pain at some level. Cancer isn't always painful, but in cases where it is, that pain can now be effectively managed and controlled. Some nurses and doctors specialise in pain relief. or visit macmillan.org.uk4. Going into hospital 16When you first became ill, or started to have worrying symptoms, chances are you saw your family doctor. He or she is a General Practitioner (GP) and deals with all types of general health worries and problems. Until now you may never have had any other kind of doctor. As soon as your GP suspected that there may have been something seriously wrong, he or she would have referred you to a specialist at the hospital or a teenage cancer unit if they have one (see Contacts page 99). It's possible that you will have seen different doctors at your various hospital appointments. Whatever your experience, there will be one very senior doctor, called a consultant, who is in charge of what happens to you. For a full list of the healthcare staff you might meet in hospital, see page 23. Every time you go to the hospital, for anything from a test to an overnight stay, the consultant will send reports back to your family doctor so he or she will know what's happening. This way, everyone concerned with your care will always be fully informed. 4. Going into hospital 17 'I'd just got back from travelling around Europe when I felt a strong pain in my leg, which I assumed was because I'd been walking a lot. Eventually, the pain got so bad I could hardly walk, so I went to my GP who then sent me to get an x-ray. That's when the cancer was discovered in my leg. I felt annoyed that I'd have to spend time in hospital because it meant that I'd have to take time out of uni and wouldn't be able to live my normal, active life for a while.' Tom, 21 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00There are two factors to be considered here: the nearest hospital with the best facilities for your illness the specialist or consultant you were referred to in the first place by your family doctor. Each consultant works in a particular hospital (or sometimes a group of hospitals). In order to be under his or her care, you will need to become a patient at one of these. This could be a local hospital, but in some cases it may be necessary for you to be treated at a specialist unit. If this is a long way from home, and you're unable to visit in advance, you can always call the ward staff and ask any questions you may have. You might have a query about visiting arrangements or what to take with you. Whatever's on your mind, they'll be happy to help.4. Going into hospital 18'The atmosphere in the young people's unit was brilliant. Obviously nobody wants to be in hospital in the first place, but it was really friendly. There was a chill-out area called the Oasis Room. In there you could do stuff like play video games, table football, air hockey, or watch TV and DVDs.' Dan, 20How do they decide which hospital you go to? What facilities are available for young people? Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 004. Going into hospital 19This really depends on where you live. The National Health Service (including all the hospitals and clinics) is split up into different regions. It is planned that eventually there should be a special unit for young people with cancer in every region, but right now only a few exist. If there is one nearby, you'll be with other people of your own age. It also means you'll be cared for by nurses and doctors who are used to working with young people. If there is no local special unit for young people then you'll be well looked after on a children's or an adult ward. Sometimes the consultant or specialist that you're seeing makes this decision for you. However, they will consult you about it as much as possible. In fact, the promises made by the NHS to patients (known as the NHS Patients Charter), state that: 'Young people can expect to be asked if they want to go to a children's or an adults ward, or any accommodation specially for young people. They can expect to see any of the facilities the hospital has for young people'. This means that unless you are admitted as an emergency you should, where possible, have some say in which part of the hospital you will be in. Your doctor or specialist may have his or her own suggestions but you can still ask to see the alternatives or if there is a specialist unit in the area and make your own decision. or visit macmillan.org.ukIf you've never been in hospital before, you could well be in for a pleasant surprise. Of course you're there because you need care and treatment, but that doesn't mean you'll be lying flat on your back in bed all the time. Depending on whether you're in a special adolescent unit, an adult or children's ward, there will be different facilities available. No matter where you are, in fact, you'll spend quite a lot of time out of bed so you can wear normal casual clothes. You may find a day room where you can watch television and chat to 4. Going into hospital 20friends, and maybe a kitchen where you can make yourself drinks and snacks. Chances are there'll also be somewhere quiet for you to catch up on school or college work, play games or take up some new hobbies. Some children's and adolescents' units even have rooms with computers, video game consoles, music and DVD players. Wards vary in size; there may be only a few beds or lots in the same area. A few individual rooms may also be available for you to stay in during a particular part of your treatment. These may also be useful at a time when you're feeling rough and need some peace and quiet.'My mum pretty much brought my entire bedroom to me in hospital to make me feel more at home. I had all my teddy bears and posters with me. She never left my side and slept in a bed at the end of my room in the hospital every night. Whenever I needed anything or just wanted to talk, my mum was there for me.' Laura, 21So what's it like being in hospital? Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00No one can pretend being in hospital is just like being at home. The good news is that there are ways to make your stay a lot easier and more pleasant. One of the hardest things to get used to is being on a ward with other people. Often, it means having to fit in with everyone else's time for eating and sleeping. If you're used to having your own room at home it can feel a bit weird to suddenly lose your privacy. At the same time, you'll be understandably anxious about your illness and wondering what's going to happen. However you find your time in hospital, there's plenty you can do to help yourself. Here are some top tips from young people who have been through the experience, and know how to make your stay as comfortable as possible:4. Going into hospital 21Tips for making hospital life easier Whether you have your own room or just a curtained cubicle on a ward, do everything you can to claim the space as your own. Take in posters of your favourite band, cuddly toys, photos of your dog or anything special to you. Sometimes you can bring your own duvet too. You can draw your curtains around your bed whenever you like. There are bound to be times when you want to be on your own and you have a right to do that. Take in a personal music player, a handheld gaming console, or any gadget guaranteed to entertain you for hours on end. Borrow stuff from friends and family, such as portable DVD players and films you haven't seen before. Take lots of books and magazines. Again, ask your friends and family to bring in new ones to swap. or visit macmillan.org.uk Unless you're having tests, or need to be confined to bed, you'll be able to wear everyday clothes. So be sure to pack things that are comfortable and make you feel good. A hat, cap or bandana could also come in useful ( see page 45, From hair to where? ). And if there's anything you've forgotten, ask your family to bring it in. Check out the A -Z of who does what in hospital on page 23 . The more you understand about what's going on, the more relaxed you'll feel. Without doubt, the young people's wards are well suited to meet your needs and interests. There are always activities and games going on, and the ward staff can be a laugh. What's more, young people don't moan as much as adults, making it a much better environment all round. If you aren't needed on the ward, for tests or to see the doctor, you may be able to hang out with other young people in the hospital. You may even have the opportunity to go out of the hospital with friends or family - just check with the staff on the ward first. Hospital meals never quite seem to match home cooking. If you fancy a change, ask friends and family to bring in food and drink. So long as you notify a member of the ward team, you could even pop out to get a takeaway. Hopefully you'll have lots of visitors while you're in hospital. If you're far from home, however, aim to stay in touch by writing letters, postcards or even emails if computer facilities are available. When it comes to what to say, make it clear that although you're in hospital you're still the same person as ever - with the same sense of humour and need to stay in touch with news and gossip. School or college work might be the last thing you feel like. Even so, making the effort to keep up does help to pass the time. Your school or college should be able to arrange for you to carry on with some work in hospital. If necessary, ask your parent/s or carer to talk to them about this. 4.

If it helps, ask your consultant to draw a diagram of what's happening or give you a hand in noting down the important points. They may even recommend a leaflet, video or DVD about cancer treatment that answers your main concerns. Just don't be scared to ask as many questions as you like. This is your body and you have a right to know what's happening.4. Going into hospital 26'I wanted to know what was happening at every stage. The doctors were really helpful and willing to tell me all the details. I did my own research, too, by looking up information on the internet about my illness and different types of treatment. This can make you feel calmer and more in control about what's happening, although the downside is that it can make me feel more paranoid about anything that could go wrong.' Tom, 21 I'm too scared to ask When you're nervous or anxious, it's very hard to take in lots of information. Most doctors are aware of this, which is why your consultant will always check if you have further questions. Even if you feel shy or embarrassed, they'll recognise how important it is for you to find out what's going on in terms you understand. One way to make sure you get the answers you're seeking is by writing down your questions in advance. You could even start by ringing the ward or the clinic where you're going to have your treatment (and ask them to call back if they're busy). Questions you might have Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00if you can have a look at the scanning machine beforehand. Just ask one of the nurses at the clinic or on the ward about it. They should also be able to introduce you to someone who's had a scan recently. You'll find just chatting about the experience will help to reassure you. Should you find it hard to stay calm, it's sometimes possible to have a pill or an injection to calm you down beforehand. You'll still be awake but very woozy and unlikely to remember much about it afterwards.4. Going into hospital 27Must I have a scan? Plenty of people feel edgy about having a scan. It basically involves lying very still in a confined space, and there can often be a lot of humming and mechanical noise going on around you. It may not be very relaxing, but it's a vital part of getting your diagnosis right so that you can receive the treatment you need. On the upside, it definitely doesn't hurt. If you're nervous, which is understandable, you'll find it helps 'I had MRI scans - they're noisy and not particularly nice to do, but they're not scary. It's a bit daunting the first time you go in one because you don't know what's going to happen, but after a while you just get used to it. The worst thing is if you've got an itch and you can't scratch it!' Laura, 21 or visit macmillan.org.ukthem to visit. It might be awkward to begin with, but you'll soon show that you're just the same person that you've always been, no matter how you feel about your appearance. You need to build on this connection as your confidence returns, and arrange to catch up with other friends. By reconnecting with your social life in this way, you can only feel stronger as an individual.4. Going into hospital 28'I'm in hospital having chemotherapy and it's going OK, but I feel like I've been left behind. I haven't seen friends for some time, but now I'm really missing them. The trouble is I'm worried about how they'll react when they see me. Any ideas?' Sara, 16 Facing friends You've been through a tough time. Chances are you've also learned a lot about what makes you tick, and in many ways this is a strength you need to draw upon. Right now, you're feeling isolated. Your friends will be aware of this, but may well be finding it hard to know how to break the ice with you. So why not take the lead here? Contact a close friend and invite Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00It's also common to feel different somehow, on returning from a period of treatment. Dealing with cancer forces you to confront some strong emotions, which can leave you with the sense that you've grown up faster than your friends. So long as you view this as a positive development, however, you could find this serves you well in terms of dealing with friends both new and old. So for now, take one step at a time and recognise that restoring your health is central to rejoining life outside the hospital. You can still keep your social life ticking over by inviting people to visit and staying in touch by letter or email. 4. Going into hospital 29'I've been in hospital for some time now. All I can think about is getting back my normal life, but it's so frustrating not knowing when that will happen. What worries me is that everyone will have moved on without me, and I'll be left out.' Jim, 18Catching up It's great that you're so focused on getting back on your feet again. The key is not to rush things, or create anxiety for yourself by feeling like you're missing out. You only have to think how it is when you return from a holiday to accept that it doesn't take long to get back up to speed. If anything, the catching up process gives you lots to talk about. There's bound to be news and gossip for your friends to share, and while you might not feel up to tearing around right away, it won't take long before you feel back in the loop. or visit macmillan.org.uk5. Treatment for cancer 30If you are diagnosed with cancer, treatment will begin at the earliest opportunity. In simple terms, this means your medical team will put together a plan of action to combat the illness as effectively as they can. The experience is different for everyone, but it helps to know what you can expect. Who's in charge? During your time in hospital, you'll probably see several different doctors. No matter how many you encounter, your consultant is in charge of your treatment. You may not see them every day but you or your family can always ask for an appointment to talk to them.When you come into hospital you'll also be introduced to the nurses who will care for you on the ward. They have specialist experience of working with young people with cancer, and will be keeping track of everything that happens to you. You should be able to talk to them about any worries or problems you have concerning your cancer treatment. Whatever's on your mind, they'll be happy to listen and help. As a young person, you have a right to a full discussion and explanation of your illness and treatment. There may be times when you prefer to talk to the medical staff without your parent/s or carer being with you, and you can always ask for this if you wish. (See Do I have any say in my treatment? on page 47).5. Treatment for cancer 31 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00'I don't know how I'd have coped without my consultant. He explained everything really well and it was easy to have a good joke with him, too. He's a really nice man.' Tom, 21There are various types of cancer treatments available. Your doctors will select the most appropriate course of action depending on your diagnosis and the hospital where 5. Treatment for cancer 32'My brain tumour was of high-grade malignancy, so the doctors knew they had to act fast. They decided I should have radiotherapy , which involved going through four weeks of preparation and having several MRI scans so they could pinpoint the exact part of the brain to be treated. 'However, three days before starting radiotherapy they decided it was best to operate. 90% of the tumour was removed during surgery , and after that I also received radiotherapy . What was left of the tumour has shrunk since radiotherapy and is now dormant - so long as it doesn't grow any more, I'm happy and just getting on with my life.' Rochelle, 21What sort of treatments are used for cancer? Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00you're being treated. They'll also explain why they have chosen one particular treatment or combination of treatments for your cancer.Surgery - an operation to remove a cancerous lump or tumour . This is usually done under a general anaesthetic . You will have to stay in hospital at least one night and possibly for longer, for example until your wound has healed. When the cancer is all in one place, surgery is a very effective way of getting rid of it. You may be worried about how you'll look and feel afterwards and it can be helpful to talk to someone who has had the same operation. Your doctor or nurse can usually arrange for you to do this. Radiotherapy - treating the cancer with high-energy x-rays. You lie still on a table while the machine directs these x-rays exactly at the site of the cancer. The treatment usually only lasts for around one minute and it doesn't hurt. Afterwards, however, your skin may feel as though you have sunburn and it could be red and sore. Radiotherapy is often done as an outpatient treatment. This means 5. Treatment for cancer 33The main types of treatment are: you can go home after the session. A normal course of treatment would require one radiotherapy session every weekday for up to about six weeks. You will be told how to look after your skin to help stop it getting too sore. Any discomfort will go away when the treatment stops. Chemotherapy - a way of treating the cancer with a special mix of anti-cancer drugs. Different cancers respond to different drugs and your doctor will prescribe the most effective combination for you. Chemotherapy is given directly into the bloodstream through a vein. This can be done in different ways, depending on what is most appropriate for you: A Hickman line is a long fine tube inserted into one of the large veins in the chest (and also known as a skin tunneled catheter). It saves you the hassle of injections and needles. It can stay in for weeks, months, and even years if necessary. A Hickman line is visible, but doesn't hurt. or visit macmillan.org.uk A portacath works in a similar way to a Hickman line , but looks very different. It's basically a dome- shaped device, about the size of a ten pence piece, which is surgically fitted over the chest. Inside is a silicone bubble into which injections can be made. This leads to a tube underneath, which is inserted into a vein above the heart. A portacath isn't as visible as a Hickman line , and doesn't hurt. You can also swim with one. A PICC line is a flexible tube inserted into a vein, usually in your arm. The PICC line is then threaded along the vein into your chest. A cannula is a thin plastic tube inserted into a vein in the hand, wrist or arm using a needle with a plastic tube. When the needle is taken out the plastic tube remains, and can stay in a vein for a day or two only. In general, a cannula isn't used for chemotherapy , but it is useful if you only need intravenous for a short time. Chemotherapy is sometimes an outpatient procedure. This means you may be able to live at home and travel to the hospital for treatment. It usually takes several months for a course of treatment, with breaks between each session so you can carry on with life as normal.5. Treatment for cancer 34'I went through six months of chemotherapy , a month of radiotherapy and an operation to remove a tumour . I also had a stem cell transplant, which was a relatively new procedure at that time and I was told that there was a chance my cells might not recover afterwards.' Jonathan, 23 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00Different cancers respond to different kinds of treatment. Sometimes more than one approach will be used. You may even find that there is someone else on your ward with the same type of cancer as you receiving a different treatment. Don't let this worry you. Just discuss it with your nurse or doctor and they will help ease any concerns. Sometimes other treatments may be used as well as (or instead of) chemotherapy or radiotherapy : Bone marrow transplant: This procedure is often carried out when the only way of treating the cancer involves high doses of chemotherapy or radiotherapy . It's highly effective in killing off the cancer, but also destroys healthy cells that can cause side effects or even other illnesses. When fit and healthy, your body can quickly replace any cells that are lost. With lower doses of chemotherapy , the body is able to replace the lost, healthy cells between treatments. But with higher doses, larger numbers of healthy cells are destroyed - particularly the blood cells that help you fight infection. These cells are made inside your bones in the bone marrow. If your bone marrow becomes damaged by high doses of chemotherapy (or sometimes radiotherapy ), then a transplant of fresh healthy bone marrow can be given from a donor if there is a match. Usually, this is a close relative like a brother or sister. Some people can have a little of their own bone marrow taken and stored before treatment begins. It is then transplanted back after treatment. Stem cell transplant: Your body is constantly producing new blood cells. An early stage of this production is known as stem cell production. These go on to grow into red or white blood cells depending on which the body needs most. A technique has now been developed for harvesting these cells using a special machine. This means stem cells may be taken from someone facing cancer treatment, and then injected back into their blood afterwards. The stem cells go on to develop into all the different types of blood cells, depending on what the body requires. Stem cell transplant is a relatively new treatment, and more suitable for some people than others. 5. Treatment for cancer 35 or visit macmillan.org.uk5. Treatment for cancer 36Chances are you're aware that the drugs and treatments used against cancer are powerful. They're the result of years of research and new developments are going on all the time. Today, cancer treatments are more effective than they've ever been before. Due to their strength, however, there can be side effects. These may include: nausea and vomiting (feeling or actually being sick) diarrhoea (the runs) constipation hair loss - this may be just the hair on your head but could include your body hair, eyebrows and eyelashes ( see From hair to where? on page 45 for more info) irritated or sore skin on areas exposed to radiotherapy'I didn't really feel any side effects from the chemo at first. It was worse having chemo the second time around - it made me feel really sick. 'I'd been in intensive care for a while and when I was finally able to stand up and make it to a mirror, I saw for the first time that my hair had gone. It was really shocking. My hair's grown back now - it's long and I still can't get used to having so much of it.' Laura, 21Side effects of treatment Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00 loss of weight - this can be quite sudden and dramatic weight gain - often linked to steroids , a type of anti-cancer drug mouth infections and painful ulcers a sore bottom grotty, achy, flu-like symptoms periods of extreme tiredness general lowered resistance to infection - which means you have to be careful not to catch other people's bugs. The side effects can be draining, which is why it's so important that you get through your treatment by facing one day at a time. Make sure you tell people when you want to rest, and be aware that much can be done to counter the side effects, from anti-sickness medication to highly effective painkillers. 5. Treatment for cancer 375. Treatment for cancer 38'It's important to be strict with yourself and constantly keep an eye on your health, like checking whether your glands feel normal. There was one night when I was at home in between chemotherapy treatments when I was feeling hot and feverish. I should've taken my temperature but I was so tired I couldn't be bothered. My dad eventually persuaded me to do it, and because it was high he took me to hospital. By the time they'd done any tests it was about 2am and it turned out I had an infection in my lungs. So it really was worth making the effort to get checked out, even if all I wanted to do at the time was go to bed.' Jonathan, 23Managing infection Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00People on chemotherapy and radiotherapy are also at risk of infection. This is due to lowered immunity. In some cases, an infection can rapidly become serious, so it's important to act quickly. As a rule, if you develop a high temperature when you have had chemotherapy, you will need a course of antibiotics . Due to the risk of infection, it's important to check your temperature regularly. A temperature over 37.5\u00b0C requires close monitoring. A temperature over 38\u00b0C needs to be reviewed on the ward by the doctors. In short, if you have a temperature, then call the hospital, as you may need tests and a course of antibiotics. Other symptoms are also worth reporting to the hospital. If you're just feeling unwell, have a fever, upset stomach, sore throat, rash, ear ache, or have been in contact with someone who has chicken pox, then get it checked out. A nurse will take a blood test, monitor your temperature, blood 5. Treatment for cancer 39pressure and any other vital signs, and possibly put you on antibiotics. You may be put in isolation in order not to catch anything else, and monitored closely until you're better. You may be treated in your local hospital for management of your infection, rather than a specialist cancer centre. or visit macmillan.org.ukIt's important that you tell them exactly how you feel, so they can pinpoint the most effective combination of drugs for you. Side effects can be understandably distressing, but in most cases they'll go away when the treatment stops. Some chemotherapy drugs can have specific side effects. This means they only happen with that particular drug or group of drugs. For example, one drug might give you tingling and a numb feeling in your hands and feet, while another might give you a metallic taste in your mouth. As there are lots of different chemotherapy drugs, your doctor should explain what to expect with the particular ones you are taking. If you have any questions, be sure to ask. Most side effects clear up when the treatment stops. If you've experienced hair loss, for example, chances are it will grow again (see page 45 for more details). 5. Treatment for cancer 40To minimise the risk of infection, you should: wherever possible try to avoid people with colds or who are ill wash and peel all fruit and vegetables thoroughly wash regularly and properly, especially your hands, using soap .Most people who are treated for cancer experience some side effects, from hair loss to weight changes. When they occur, there are lots of ways that the medical staff can help, just as you can help yourself. For example, some types of chemotherapy can make you feel very sick. If this happens, the doctors can prescribe a different drug at the same time that will help you feel better. Minimising the risk of infection Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 005. Treatment for cancer 41'The doctors talked to me about the possible effects of chemo on fertility, and they also told me to keep an eye on my menstrual cycle because sometimes your periods can become irregular or stop altogether when you're on chemo. My periods have been ok, though - they stayed regular.' Natalie, 18 Cancer treatment can lead to a loss of fertility (your ability to have children in both males and females), but this is often temporary. For more information, see Will it affect my sex life? on page 60. You'll probably be in hospital for at least the start of your treatment, so be sure to talk to any of the staff about your worries. Ultimately, you can ask for further help or information at any time. Even if you're at home, you can always ring the ward for advice.Both Macmillan and the Teenage Cancer Trust provide free resources about the impact of cancer on sex, relationships and fertility. Check out the Contacts section on page 99 for more details. Fertility or visit macmillan.org.ukSome side effects can be eased using medication, such as painkillers and anti-sickness drugs. Alongside this (or instead of it with consultation from your doctor), it's worth considering an approach called complementary therapy. This is a range of alternative treatments that aim to help you relax about what you're going through, and feel less stressed. The belief is that your body is better prepared to tackle cancer if you're feeling positive about yourself. Complementary therapies Complementary therapy is big business. It also divides opinion as to whether it's really effective. Some people swear by certain treatments, while others aren't so sure. It's worth checking out what's on offer, of course, but vital that you talk it 5. Treatment for cancer 42through with your consultant, doctor or nurse, before giving it a go. Basically, you need to be sure it won't interfere with the medical treatment you're receiving. Below, you'll find a list of popular complementary therapies that are unlikely to affect your treatment, but can help you to relax and feel better able to cope: Acupuncture - careful insertion of needle tips under the skin to stimulate body and soul. Aromatherapy - exercises the senses for general peace of mind. Art and music therapy - express yourself through art and music to help you relax.Coping with common side effects 'I've found acupuncture to be really helpful in building my strength and energy up.' Jonathan, 23 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00Counselling - a talking therapy that encourages you to deal with worries and anxieties. Massage - de-stresses the body, de-stresses the mind. Meditation - a way of tuning out to help feel calmer. Reflexology - uses pressure on feet to stimulate pressure points around the body to improve wellbeing. Reiki - a hands-on spiritual approach to restoring inner balance.Relaxation therapies - aims to help you chill out and promotes a sense of harmony.5. Treatment for cancer 43'A music therapist came to visit the ward and we'd listen to music together. I really enjoyed doing that. I even wrote a song with him which I'm going to perform at a conference in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. It's nice to have something like that to look back on.' Tom, 21Sea bands - applies gentle pressure to points on the wrists to help combat nausea and sickness (available from your pharmacist). Tai chi - promotes good health through this gentle martial art. Visualisation - taps into the calming power of your imagination. Yoga - a combination of graceful physical exercise and breathing control. Some people really benefit from complementary therapies such as these, but it doesn't work for everyone. We all relax in different ways, after all. What matters is that you know how to chill out, and recognise that it can help you tackle your illness. or visit macmillan.org.uk'I listened to a lot of music to help me get through my worst moments. I also planned to go to lots of gigs in between chemo treatments, so it gave me something to look forward to.' Gemma, 19 Your kind of therapy Complementary therapy can be anything you like, so long as it doesn't interfere with your treatment but helps you feel less stressed. Here are some DIY suggestions for tackling the kind of anxiety often associated with cancer treatment: Listen to your favourite sounds on your portable music player. Relaxation tapes, CDs and MP3s are also widely available, so ask if there are any on the ward. Writing and drawing are great ways for relieving anxiety and other bottled-up emotions. They can also help you keep in touch with friends and family. Trying out hats, jewellery and make up can help you accept the fact you're going to look different for a while. You may have other ideas yourself. You can make a note of them on the pages in this booklet for you to claim as your own. You could also call Macmillan and share them with us for the benefit of other young people with cancer.5. Treatment for cancer 44 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00The degree of hair loss will depend on the type of treatment and your sensitivity to it. With some drugs, it is very likely that you'll lose your hair, or find it thins (this could include your body hair, eyebrows and eyelashes).If your hair starts to fall out, keep it clean and brushed and cut it short to avoid knotting. It will grow back after treatment, even if it does reward you with a new look in terms of a different colour or texture. In cases involving 5. Treatment for cancer 45'I had hair loss to the area of my head treated with radiotherapy . Losing my hair didn't really affect my confidence, though - I suppose I was more concerned about my brain tumour at the time. Besides, I had really big, thick bushy hair before and I just thought it would save me a fortune in shampoo and hours of straightening. It's growing back now, apart from one little bald spot on the top of my head which must've been the bit that got the most radiation. So I'm spending a fortune on accessories like headbands and scarves at the moment!' Rochelle, 21From hair to where? high doses of radiotherapy in the treatment of brain tumours , or with particular kinds of chemotherapy , hair growth may not return, but this is an exception rather than the rule. If you feel more comfortable covering up your hair loss, scarves or wigs are the norm. However you feel about the situation - and some people thrive on making a statement out of it - don't lose sight of the fact that your hair will grow back. or visit macmillan.org.ukIn many hospitals you may find a wig service on offer. Your nurse or specialist should know where the service is, so feel free to ask. You are entitled to have one wig per year through the NHS - and in any style, colour and shape you wish. You can even take it to the hairdressers for styling. It's often better to get the wig as soon as possible, so you can then choose whether or not to wear it. Many people get a wig but then decide not to use it as the hair loss is not as bad as anticipated. It's often good to take a sample of your hair before it falls out. This way, you can match any future wigs to it, even if you do go on to try something completely different.If you choose to wear a wig, it's best not to keep it on at night as your scalp will benefit from being aired. Brush the wig regularly to avoid it becoming knotty. Also be aware that wearing a wig in summer can be hot and uncomfortable. If it gets too much, a bandana or baseball cap are effective ways of staying cool and feeling confident. Hair loss can be a big deal to some people, and not to others. Healthcare professionals are aware of this, and aim to provide all the support and advice you need to hold your head up high. Sometimes, it helps to talk to other young people who have coped with hair loss. If this appeals, the team treating you will do everything they can to put you in touch with someone who can address your worries and try to give you peace of mind.5. Treatment for cancer 46 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00One of the big problems with suddenly becoming very ill is the feeling of being out of control. You're seeing all these doctors, nurses and specialists and everyone seems to be telling you what to do. They have your best interests at heart, of course, but it's only human to feel like saying 'hang on, don't I have any say in this?'. When your cancer is first diagnosed, your consultant will outline a proposed plan of treatment. Sometimes this plan may change according to how you get on, but you should always be told of any decisions or changes made. Of course, even the best doctor or nurse can forget to tell you, or they may assume you're up to speed. If you're in any doubt, or if you don't understand what's happening, just go ahead and ask. In some ways, voicing any worries or concerns just tells them you're keen to be as prepared as possible for the treatment ahead. Although your doctor/s will make the final decision about treatment, they may involve you in discussing different options. Even if this doesn't happen, you always have the right to a full explanation of any proposed treatment. 5. Treatment for cancer 47'It was scary waiting around and not knowing how I was going to be treated - I was worried that the tumour could grow bigger in the meantime. Eventually, I insisted on having a consultation with a neurosurgeon to explain the situation to me better - this made me feel a bit more in control.' Rochelle, 21Do I have any say in my treatment? or visit macmillan.org.ukThis means your doctor should make time to explain the implications and side effects of treatment as well as answer any questions you may have. Also be aware of the fact that treatment cannot be carried out without your consent . Up until the age of 16, the written consent of your parent or guardian may also be required. Over the age of 16 you can sign the consent form yourself. If you aren't sure about agreeing to a particular type of treatment you can always ask for more time to think about it. Talk to your doctor or one of your nurses about the issue. There may even be other patients on your ward who have experience of the same treatment, and they can give you an idea of what to expect. Even if it's an emergency situation and there isn't a lot of time to make up your mind, you can usually ask for a few minutes to think or talk to a nurse. Remember the hospital staff will always recommend what they think is best, but you still have a right to keep control over what is done to you. Making choices Whenever it is possible to choose between two methods of treatment, you should be given the options available. This should be backed up with all the information the doctors can provide to help in making your decision. Just be aware that often they cannot offer a great deal of choice because they have to recommend the best treatment for your particular condition. 5. Treatment for cancer 48'I chose to have my leg amputated. Obviously it wasn't an easy decision to take off a large part of my body, but I'd lost so much use of my leg anyway as a result of surgery and infections that had stopped my muscles from recovering properly. It was harder to live with the leg I'd been left with than it's been without the leg at all.' Dan, 20 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00Huge advances have been made over recent years in cancer treatment, particularly the kinds that affect young people. Today, many more people are cured than ever before. What's more, treatment is improving all the time. Often there may be more than one treatment for a particular cancer, or a new approach may be showing some promise. Sometimes a tried and tested treatment could be used in a new way with more effective results, such as giving a different dose of a drug over a longer or shorter period of time than usual. In order to push the boundaries of cancer treatment forward, however, clinical trials must be carried out. 5. Treatment for cancer 49Clinical trials 'I was under 16 when I took part in a clinical trial, so my mum and dad had to give permission for me to do it. I was happy to let the doctors get on with it because I trusted them, although my mum was constantly questioning them about what they were doing to me and about the side effects I might have.' Natalie, 18 or visit macmillan.org.ukWhat is a clinical trial? In a nutshell, it's a medical research study involving people. It doesn't just focus on chemo, but anything that might help diagnose, treat or prevent an illness like cancer. A clinical trial is a comparison of an existing treatment with a new one. The aim is to find out if the new treatment is more effective. This is done by giving the new treatment to one group of people and the established treatment to another. The results are studied in terms of their benefits and drawbacks such as side effects. It's important to note that any clinical trial is strictly controlled, and that your welfare remains a number one priority throughout. All trials will have been tested fully in the laboratory, and often on people too. In a clinical trial, certain rules have to be followed to avoid misleading results. For example, everyone entered into the trial must have a similar condition and situation. One of the most important rules is that the trial should not be biased in favour of one treatment over the other. Also, some trials are 'randomised'. This means that the details of all the people being included in the trial are fed into a computer and their treatment is chosen at random from those included in the trial. So is my treatment being left to chance? If you enter a randomised clinical trial, your treatment will be chosen at random from those available in the trial. So, there is an element of chance in this, but the trial will have been planned following strict guidelines. There must be very good reasons for believing that a new or different treatment may give better results than the usual one, though there can be no guarantee of this. Clinical trials are reviewed every few months. If you agree to take part in one, and it becomes clear before it's over that one treatment is definitely better than the other, it will be stopped and the more effective treatment given to everyone.5. Treatment for cancer 50 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00How can I be sure it's the right choice to make? You're bound to have questions if your consultant suggests taking part in a clinical trial. They won't want you to feel under any pressure to join in, however, and will be happy to discuss at length any concerns you have. It's natural to feel like they're basically suggesting an experiment, but the fact is that if there's a chance that it could lead to improved results then it has to be worth considering. You can't be entered into a trial without your written consent if you're over 16, or that of a parent or guardian if you're under 16. No one is going to put you under pressure to enter a trial. If you decide to say no to a trial that's not a problem and you will be given the best treatment in use at the time.5. Treatment for cancer 51 or visit macmillan.org.uk52Finding out you have cancer can come as an enormous shock. Facing treatment might be just as difficult to take in, especially when you learn about the possible side effects. It's not surprising that some people wonder whether it's worth the trouble and pain. Often people set out on their treatment thinking that whatever happens, they'll take it in their stride. But the treatments themselves can make you feel ill and most people find that there are times when they feel very down. When this happens, it's easy to lose confidence and 5. Treatment for cancer Is it all worth it? 'Unless you've got a close friend or relative who's had cancer, it can be hard to find people to speak to who understand what you're going through. I sometimes felt isolated and needed support and reassurance. It doesn't have to be such a lonely experience, though. There are professionals and organisations that understand and are able to offer support. You shouldn't be embarrassed to tell anyone how you feel.' Jonathan, 23 hope, and sometimes the temptation is to shut yourself off and not to talk to anyone. However, it's really important to talk about how you're feeling with the doctors and nurses, or someone else you can trust, for example, perhaps by calling Macmillan. Cancer treatment is tough, but with all the great advances that are happening, more and more people are being cured. This can't be true for absolutely everyone and nobody can give you a total guarantee that treatment will be 100% successful. Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 00535. Treatment for cancer or visit macmillan.org.uk Learning to live with this uncertainty is one of the hardest parts of living with cancer. Even for those people who aren't cured, cancer can often be controlled for long periods with the right kind of drugs. Today, advances in medicine mean doctors are learning more about lessening the effects of the illness and helping people get the most out of their life.6. Am I still me? 546. Am I still me?6. Am I still me? 55Both cancer itself and the treatments for cancer can often affect the way you look. Sometimes this is temporary, such as losing your hair during chemotherapy. But just because you know it will grow again eventually doesn't necessarily make it any easier to deal with at the time. Other changes may be more long term - or even permanent - and coming to terms with the prospect of looking different can be difficult. It can have an impact on your body image, which is about the way you see yourself - and how it makes you feel. That's why the most constructive thing you can do at this time is get to grips with what you can expect, and remind yourself that you're still the same person on the inside - which is something that can never change. How might my looks change? Weight gain/loss: a big issue with many young people with cancer. When you become ill, particularly when you start having chemotherapy , you may suddenly lose a lot of weight. Apart from leaving you feeling weak, it will also make you look different. 'I felt really weak and lost a lot of weight. I'm 6ft 1in and went down to nine stone, so I looked a bit like a Twiglet. I didn't feel self-conscious of the way I looked in front of my friends and family, although I wouldn't have wanted to go into town when I was at my worst because I was aware of how ill I looked.' Tom, 21 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 006. Am I still me? 56Some cancer patients are prescribed drugs called steroids and these can make you put on a great deal of weight very suddenly. This is particularly hard to deal with if you've spent years battling with your weight. You may be worried about what your friends will say or think, so you should tell them that the change is temporary and is caused by all the drugs you're taking - not an overdose of chocolate and chips! Tubes and drains: during chemotherapy you may have a Hickman line (or portocath ) inserted into your chest (under anaesthetic or sedation). In the same way, after surgery you may need to have a tube or drain coming out of part of your body. Understandably, some people are concerned or even daunted by the prospect. Asking questions, talking to your nurse and learning what the tubes are for and how to look after them will help you feel more confident. Reassuringly, most people get used to them very quickly.Scarring of the skin: often happens after surgery . Whatever operation you have, the doctors will always try to make sure you end up looking as normal as possible, but some scarring may be inevitable. Scars always look worse straight after surgery when they are red and very obvious, but they do fade a lot with time. Loss of body part: eg amputation (cutting off) of an arm or leg for bone cancer. This is obviously something that anyone would dread but sometimes it's the only way to stop the cancer. Surgeons always try to spare a limb if possible, for example by removing the cancerous part of the bone and replacing it with a prosthetic (artificial) one instead. But this is not always possible and amputation of the limb or part of it may be necessary. The doctors will make their decision by considering the best way to get rid of the cancer. Even if the surgeons recommend amputating the limb, or a section of it, they'll Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 006. Am I still me? 57do everything they can to ensure you stay mobile afterwards by fitting you with a prosthetic replacement (a false arm or leg). Hair loss: a side effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy to the head. It is a big problem but not everyone loses their hair. If you do lose your hair, you'll probably also lose your body hair, eyebrows and eyelashes. And all of a sudden you'll look like a different person. It nearly always re-grows after treatment, but it can look slightly different. (See From hair to where?, page 42). 'Before getting ill, I was a well-built lad - I'd been working as a builder's labourer for years. During chemo I lost every hair on my body and became quite thin. I didn't want people to see me looking as I did, so I completely withdrew into myself. I knew it was hard for my friends to know what to say to me, and I thought my appearance made it even worse for them. I stayed close to three friends who were always really supportive, though. My self-confidence has grown since then, and having my leg amputated hasn't affected it either - I can drive and go to work, and I haven't had any problem getting girlfriends...' Dan, 20How can I cope with looking different? or visit macmillan.org.uk6. Am I still me? 58Sometimes your family and the people around you may not understand how upset you are by worries about your body image. Their main concern is getting you well. It can mean that unless you tell them what's worrying you it may not register with them. But feeling unattractive and different from other people are big issues. It may be OK in hospital, but if you're hoping to go back to school, college or work then you could well be anxious about being laughed at, teased or even rejected because of your appearance. You might even think it would be harder to get a boyfriend or girlfriend, or that your existing partner might go off you. For many people in this situation, the temptation is to withdraw and keep quiet about what's on your mind. But the fact is people will understand, and want to help. It really is just a question of being open and honest, and giving them a chance to remind you that your appearance can't change your personality - which is what makes a lasting impact on the people around you.One way to restore confidence in yourself is by making an effort to stay in touch with friends. If you can arrange to see them on a regular basis, you'll have less time to let body image insecurities build. Even just making phone calls or writing letters and emails can help you feel more confident about facing the world again. It's also very important that you express your feelings. This might not come naturally to you, particularly if you've always been told to be brave. Crying is one way of dealing with it, as it helps to release any tension and stress you're under, as is simply talking things through with someone you trust. You may also need to go through a grieving process, particularly if you've lost a limb or part of your body. Some people find this makes them even more determined to pursue their ambitions or goals, or encourages them to set their sights on new challenges. Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 006. Am I still me? 59But if your treatment has forced you to review what you're able to achieve, it can come as a blow. Whatever the situation, if it's left you feeling low then it's vital that you open up about it. The key is to feel comfortable in the way you choose to express yourself. Talking to people about your feelings really does help. If you don't want to open up to your family or friends, there are always the professionals in hospital you can turn to. Social workers and counsellors are trained to listen and help you work through your feelings. If there's no-one around or you prefer not to discuss your worries face to face you can always call Macmillan. Alternatively, you'll find chat rooms and message boards online that are dedicated to helping young people with cancer to connect with one another and share their experiences (see Contacts, page 99, for details).Another way of letting out your feelings is to express yourself through writing, drawing or painting. You may not have tried to draw or paint since you were a child, but many people rediscover the fun and enjoyment of art while they're in hospital. It's also a good way to keep in touch with friends and relatives and a brilliant way of letting out anger and depression. Next time someone asks you if they should bring you in some grapes, maybe you should ask for a paint set instead! or visit macmillan.org.uk6. Am I still me? 60If you're sexually active there are some things you ought to know. Firstly, living with cancer doesn't have to call a halt to your sex life. If you were in a relationship before you became ill, you may be wondering how to cope now. Or you may even meet and fall for someone while you're ill or in remission. Your friendship may have reached a sexual stage or, perhaps for cultural, religious or personal reasons, you may have decided that the time has not yet arrived for a sexual relationship. Feeling warm and loving with someone is an important part of your emotional and physical life. If you already have a partner then continuing your sex life can help reassure you that, despite your cancer, the rest of your life goes on as normal. On some occasions during your treatment and recovery you may not feel like having sex, but a cuddle or comforting hug can still be very welcome. Your partner may be worried that they will hurt you or do you harm by getting too close. It's always best to try and talk about your feelings and discuss what changes may be necessary in your relationship while you're ill. Most people find it hard to talk about such deeply personal issues as sex, and many are embarrassed to raise the subject with medical staff. But doctors and nurses appreciate that sexuality is an important part of your personality and wellbeing, and should be able to answer your questions with sensitive advice. There should always be private space available for this type of discussion and you can ask to talk to a nurse or doctor of the same gender as you if you prefer. If you are using the contraceptive pill your doctor may ask you to stop taking it before you have surgery or start chemotherapy or radiotherapy . If you were put on the pill as a means of stopping heavy periods then discuss the implications first. It's also wise to use condoms for any sexual activity if you're receiving chemotherapy , and for a few days after the treatment is complete. Will it affect my sex life? Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 006. Am I still me? 61If you are going to have intercourse, there is a slim possiblity that chemotherapy drugs could be passed through seminal and vaginal fluids. It's worth taking responsibility for your partner's welfare by using this barrier method. Should you have any other questions, be sure to ask. Your doctor will understand, and seek to reassure you. Can I still have children? During cancer treatment it's common for both men and women to be infertile (unable to have children) for a time, but this isn't always predictable. So, if you are a girl whose periods stop as a result of cancer treatment, it's not necessarily a sign that you will be unable to get pregnant in future. It is not recommended that you get pregnant during or for a time after cancer treatment. If this is an issue for you please discuss it with your consultant. While chemotherapy for men and women is likely to have a temporary effect on their ability to have children - in some cases infertility may be permanent. This is particularly likely if you have total body irradiation (TBI) before a bone marrow or stem cell transplant or if a young woman has radiotherapy to her pelvic area. Your doctor should discuss these risks with you before treatment, but don't be afraid to raise the subject if you're unsure or don't understand. Where the treatment of a young man carries a risk of affecting his fertility, he should be offered sperm banking. This is the collection of sperm before treatment that is then frozen, in case it's needed later to make his current or future partner pregnant. Sometimes there is a cost involved in this. The Teenage Cancer Trust (see contacts section) have produced a DVD about sperm banking called 'Whack to the future' , which provides information and advice. Unfortunately no facilities are available at present for the collection and storage of a woman's eggs (ova), although research is ongoing to improve the situation. or visit macmillan.org.uk7 . Cancer and relationships 627. Cancer and relationships 63Having cancer in the family (even if you're not the one who's got it) puts a big strain on everyone - especially in the way you relate to one another. It's natural to feel short-tempered and snappy when you're unwell, and it doesn't help if you're undergoing steroid treatment as that can also have an impact on your mood. In the same way, parents, siblings and friends can find it hard to handle the stress of the situation. They might also become irritable or short-tempered, and if you haven't been getting along well anyway then it can be a source of conflict.'My illness divided the family - everyone argued all the time. There were moments when I just thought: 'I don't need this.' I often told them to sort it out amongst themselves instead of arguing in the same room as me.' Laura, 21 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 007. Cancer and relationships 64Any two people who communicate on a regular basis (even if very rare) are in a relationship. Maybe your kid sister irritates you like mad and all you ever do is shout at her. You certainly wouldn't consider telling her your personal secrets. But it's still a relationship. Communication isn't just about talking face to face. It's everything from a hug to a grunt. From a love letter to a silly postcard. As a young person you're going through the important but difficult stage of breaking away from your family and becoming an individual in your own right. This is often a recipe for communication breakdown. All teenagers have rows with their parents - it's part of learning how to negotiate and compromise - but it can also make it difficult to talk to people. Sometimes you can't say what you want to those closest to you. In the same way, if someone seems intimidating, like a head teacher or senior doctor, it can be hard to know how to relate to them. If you were younger, you'd probably say the first thing that came into your head without worrying about it first. And if you were older, with more self-confidence, you'd have no hesitation in expressing yourself clearly. Being the age you are can make life very difficult!'Sometimes steroids affected my mood, making me snap quickly - especially at my brother and sisters. My family knew why I was acting like this so they learned not to take any notice when I was being grumpy. My family and I get on well, and I've even got to know my cousins a lot better than I used to because they often came to visit me in hospital.' Jenny, 17What makes a relationship? Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 007. Cancer and relationships 65That's why understanding exactly what's happening to you - and why - can help you regain some of the control you need to feel confident in yourself once more. Just be aware that you're not the only one to be shaken up by what's happening. Your family and friends are also under pressure and this can put stress onto the way they talk and act towards you. They may also have issues and preoccupations of their own, which can all combine to place a strain on the bond you share. The next few sections look at how the people closest to you might be affected by your illness.Discovering you have cancer changes your life. All of a sudden your focus shifts. At the same time your treatment can take you away from home and put you in unfamiliar surroundings. You have to deal with lots of new people like all the different hospital staff you'll meet. And, because you may be feeling unwell and anxious, it can be difficult to cope. Many young people with cancer, even if they're really street-wise and self-confident before they get into hospital, find themselves feeling like a child again. It can seem that they don't have control of what's going on. What's all this got to do with cancer? 'My little sister got upset and stressed about my illness at times, and she started to act a bit differently around me. For instance, we still argued but she wouldn't call me names like she used to. I think she was scared about what might happen to me. Once, she lashed out quite badly at a girl who made a nasty comment about me while I was really ill. My dad chatted to the girl's parents about it and it all got sorted.' Natalie, 18 or visit macmillan.org.uk7. Cancer and relationships 66Usually people will be really worried about you, especially your parent/s or other carers, and that's likely to stress them out. Their one wish is to protect you and make you well, but they realise that with cancer they don't have the power to do that. So they feel out of control and this can make them frightened. As a result they may try to be over- protective, such as telling you not to get tired, saying you shouldn't go out with your friends, or nagging you to eat your dinner. Understandably, this can be extremely frustrating.It helps if you - and at least one of your parents or carers - can get clear information and advice about what's safe for you to do and anything that's best avoided. For example, there may be times during chemotherapy when you are particularly at risk of infection. During this period, it wouldn't make sense to go out with anyone with an infection. Your nurses and doctors can always give you the information you need, and it's a good idea if you can all talk it through together.'It was hard to tell how well my parents coped with me being ill. It can't have been easy because they still had to look after my younger brothers while my dad worked full-time and my mum stayed with me in hospital. I do know that they got support from our wider family though, as well as from the parents of other young people who were in hospital.' Dan, 20How do parents cope with your illness? Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 007. Cancer and relationships 67Sometimes parents are already having problems. Without you being aware of it, they may have been disagreeing about money, work and other major things. Then the worry arising from your illness can act as the last straw and place their relationship under great strain. In some cases, it can lead to separation and divorce. If this happens you must remember that your illness alone wouldn't have been enough to break up a strong relationship, so you are not to blame. Social workers and counsellors are familiar with these sorts of problems and can help your parents as well as you. How do you tell your mum or dad what you really want? 'There was one point when I was really poorly after I'd developed pneumonia during chemo. I thought I was going to die, but I was too scared to talk about my feelings with my mum and dad in case it upset them. Once I'd got a bit better, my mum told me about how the doctors didn't think I'd make it. Because she had the strength to stay so upbeat when I was seriously ill but was really honest with me afterwards, I now feel like I can talk to her about anything.' Jenny, 17 or visit macmillan.org.uk7. Cancer and relationships 68As a young person, it's natural to seek a sense of independence. When you're ill, however, you do need your family's help and support - particularly at worrying times like receiving a diagnosis or when you feel really low during treatment. You may find it hard to ask for or even accept that help, but try to remember that everyone needs a bit of tender loving care sometimes. If you're scared of being smothered by affection then explain clearly and calmly what it is you'd like from them. If you feel you need more time to yourself, just say so. Parents aren't mind readers and although on the whole they're always trying to get it right, everyone gets things wrong sometimes. So give them some help.Some young people with cancer are scared to talk to a parent about their real feelings for fear of upsetting them. They say their mums and dads are putting on brave faces and trying hard to remain cheery, and worry about raising the issue for fear of causing upset. This is an understandable fear, but the people closest to you would generally much rather know the truth about how you feel. Sometimes it can be hard to talk about serious and emotional things when you're sitting face to face, or when they're visiting you in hospital and you know they have to go very soon. If you have the chance, it can be easier to talk about really important things when you're both doing something else. Perhaps your mum is driving you to a hospital appointment or you're in the kitchen together clearing up. When the focus of attention isn't directly on you it can be a lot easier to say what you really feel. Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 007. Cancer and relationships 69It can be hard for you to bear but it's important that you understand that they aren't doing it to be unpleasant or hateful, but just to show that they need attention too. If you want to help, make them aware that groups exist to provide support and advice for them (such as Macmillan's phone service). You may want to discuss it with your parents together with a social worker, activities coordinator or specialist nurse, who will have all the details you need.'My brother didn't take the pressure of me being ill very well at all. He used to fight with my mum and sister, and it didn't help that his girlfriend used to stir things up by accusing my mum of not being supportive enough of me - even though my mum was always by my side in hospital. We grew quite distant and ended up not speaking to each other because of this. We've made up since, though.' Laura, 21 It's natural for the person in a family who is ill to become the centre of attention - for a while at least. So it's no surprise that this can cause resentment in brothers and sisters. They may be fed up that everyone always asks how you are before they say anything to them, and that your parents are spending a lot of time visiting you when normally they'd be home and available for the rest of the family. This resentment may be hard to take but it's normal. It can show itself in various ways such as not wanting to visit you in hospital, behaving badly at home or school, or saying spiteful things.How does your illness affect your brothers and sisters? or visit macmillan.org.uk7. Cancer and relationships 70People often find that friendships become very strong and important while they have cancer - but it isn't always the ones you expect who give the most support. Sometimes even friends who you've been close to can find it very difficult to deal with your illness. It's partly to do with not being at school, college or work, which means you miss out on what's happening and can be gradually left out of plans. But it's also because many people are so frightened of the idea of cancer. They may really want to come and visit you but seek excuses or delay because frankly they find the prospect hard to handle. Sometimes you can break the ice by making an effort to keep in touch with them, such as by writing an email or a letter. The upside is that those friends who do stay in touch are likely to become very close friends indeed.'I felt OK in myself dealing with my illness, but telling my friends made it really hit home how serious it was. It hurt to see their reactions and to think that I was going to be away from them for a while. I didn't want them to worry. They were good friends, though. They visited me a lot and sometimes I'd just ring them up to chat about how I was feeling.' Tom, 21How will it affect your friends? Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 007. Cancer and relationships 71Making new friends in hospital is surprisingly easy. This is because you'll meet other young people with cancer. You can also join special young people's support groups - your nurse or the local Macmillan nurse will know what groups are happening in your area and you can also get suggestions from the Contacts section of this booklet on page 99. Talking with, writing to and emailing other young people with cancer can be really comforting. There's so much they will understand without you having to explain it, and of course you don't have to worry about losing your hair or having off-days when you're with them. They know because it happens to them too. Some of the friendships you build up in this way will be very close and last for a long time. But the sad reality is that some of the people you meet may die. Coming to terms with losing people close to you is another part of living with cancer. 'When I was told I'd be having chemo I felt embarrassed that all my hair would fall out. But when I was undergoing treatment and saw all the other young people without their hair, it didn't bother me as much. In fact, when we used to hang out together in the chill-out room where we'd play games and watch TV together, we'd all chat to each other about what we were going through. Everyone was really supportive and understanding because we were all going through the same thing. We even joked about how we looked without hair.' Jenny, 17Making new friends in hospital or visit macmillan.org.uk7. Cancer and relationships 72Here is a list of questions and answers which have been written based on some of the most popular questions our Macmillan nurses are asked: Work worries I first got ill halfway through my GCSE year. Although I did try to carry on and do some work, I wasn't well enough to sit my exams. My treatment went on for most of the next year, so I never went back to school and now I don't know what to do. I'm nearly 18; I suppose I'd like to get a job, but everyone keeps telling me I should get some qualifications first. Also, I'm worried about working because what if I need to take time off for hospital visits or I get ill again? Look in the phone book for the address of your local Connexions - a nationwide service providing careers advice to young people age 13 to 19. You can drop in for a chat or visit www.connexions-direct.com and contact an online adviser. Explain about your illness and tell them what line of work or study you might be interested in. If they help you find a job placement, they'll also advise on the most effective way to inform employers about your medical requirements. Alternatively, they can give you information on courses including less academic but more work-related qualifications like NVQs, Key Skills, AVCEs and BTECs. If you are 19 or over you'll be able to receive help and guidance from your local JobCentre Plus. Check out the phone book for details of your nearest branch. Questions and answers Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 007. Cancer and relationships 73Did smoking cause my cancer? I'm 16 and just been told I've got cancer. I'm really worried that it's because I used to smoke. No one knows about this except a couple of my friends. My mum would be so disappointed in me if she found out, so if I tell my doctors would they inform her? Smoking is linked to cancer and lots of other diseases. It's also habit-forming, which is why breaking free is such a big achievement, so well done for making the smart move and quitting. Even so, at 16 a former smoking habit is unlikely to have caused your cancer. In most cases, you have to smoke steadily for quite a few years before you are at a serious risk. Your doctor is likely to ask if you have a history of smoking, and you should be honest in a bid to help them build a clear medical picture. They have to keep what you say confidential so they won't tell your parents if you feel strongly that it would make the situation worse. Should you reconsider, and decide that perhaps they should know, your doctor will help explain that at your age it's unlikely to be the cause of your illness.Mum's nagging is driving me nutsI've been having chemotherapy for three months and my mum is driving me crazy with her nagging. It's bad enough when she visits me in hospital, but when I get to go home in between treatments she goes on and on about how I've got to be careful and mustn't do this or that. I know I have to take care, but I still want to see my friends and have a good time on the days I feel up to it. Try to remember that your mum is acting like this because she's scared. She's really worried about your health and is trying to do everything she can to protect you. For a mum this usually translates into holding on tight and not letting you out of her sight. Try not to get angry but talk the problems through with her. And ask one of your nurses or your social worker if they can go through the main do's and don'ts with the pair of you. Having a third person there will keep tempers cool and give your mum a chance to accept that it is ok for you to live as normal a life as possible in between treatments. or visit macmillan.org.uk7. Cancer and relationships 74Can I ask her out? I am at home at the moment during a gap in my treatment and recently I went out with my friends to a club. It was the first time I'd been out for ages and while there I met a really nice girl who one of my friends already knew vaguely. I like her and I know she's keen on me but I'm scared to ask her out because a) I'm not sure I feel up to anything, and b) I don't know what the future holds. I just don't know what to do about it.Your best approach is to be honest with her. Your life isn't normal at the moment but there's nothing to stop you getting in touch and explaining that you like her and would like to see her again. It's quite possible she already knows about your cancer from your friend. If not, just tell her but make it clear that as far as you're concerned being ill is only a temporary stage. Maybe you'll only manage to be friends at the moment, but as long as you're upfront about everything you can look back knowing you made the right move under difficult circumstances.

I was scared knowing that there weren't going to be nurses paying attention to me around the clock. I also missed seeing all the familiar faces from hospital. Laura, 21 8. Going home Becoming one of the family again All through your treatment, one of the things you will have been longing for is the day you get to go home. But as this time approaches a lot of people feel anxious or even scared. When you are ill, hospital feels a very safe place and it's amazing how quickly you get used to it. Going back home can feel like having a lifeline cut away and you're also suddenly in the thick of everyone else's problems and worries. However, as long as everyone plans ahead for it and talks about any problems beforehand, going home should be a positive step towards getting on with your life.When you lived at home before, it might have seemed as though nothing ever happened. But in most families there is a constant ebb and flow of good moods, bad moods, friendship and rows. You will have been protected from this in hospital but now you're going to be in the middle of it all again. Your parents will naturally be anxious about you and may have their own secret fears about how well they can look after and protect you once you're home. You may find them fussing and nagging, and if you're feeling tired and a bit anxious yourself, it's easy to fall out with them. Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 008. Going home 78Brothers and sisters are going to have to get used to having you around again and if they resented the attention you've been getting so far, it can be even harder for them once you're back home. On top of this you might also find it difficult to get any privacy. In hospital, at least you could draw your curtains or go back into your room when you were tired, and people would know not to disturb you. That's not always as easy at home. If you live alone, other factors might be a concern. You may not have to worry about fitting back into a family, but it can be tough moving out of an environment where a team is there to care for you twenty-four hours a day. In this situation, make friends and family aware that you've returned home, so they can keep an eye on you, and notify your social worker through your oncology unit (or general social worker service). Talk to them about a home help if required, and connect with organisations both online and offline, who understand what you're going through and can offer support, guidance and further advice (see Contacts, on page 99, for details). 'Although I withdrew into myself during the time I was ill, I think the experience brought all my family much closer together. When I went home after surgery on my leg, my mum dressed the wounds that had become infected. Also, my family had to help me get changed on my bottom half, or take me to the toilet. It wasn't particularly pleasant having to rely on them like this, but everyone chipped in and I even enjoyed having the occasional argument with my brothers because it gave me a sense of normality.' Dan, 20 Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 008. Going home 79Sorting problems before they happen 'I was really glad to go home, but I guess you could say I got 'hospital-sick' - like feeling homesick, except I missed hospital because I felt safe there in case something went wrong. Being able to keep in touch with my friends from hospital really helped, though. We still get support from each other now by staying in contact.' Natalie, 18 Talking with your family or carers about any worries you have about going home can really help. Often you can have this kind of discussion with a nurse or social worker while still in hospital. Start off by discussing the medical side of things and then go on to the emotional aspects (which are just as important). This is the time to bring up any concerns you have about people fussing too much or brothers and sisters having a go at you. No-one can protect you from this fully, but maybe you could agree that there will be some space in the house where you can take refuge when you've had enough of everyone. If you explain beforehand that this is a normal part of recovering from an illness, then people are less likely to get upset or sulk when you say you'd rather be alone for a while. It's also important for you to understand that sometimes going home can be a bit of an anticlimax. You've been looking forward to it so much that you expect everything to be fantastic, but in fact you quickly realise that everyone is going about their own business and you might feel rather left out. Remember that you aren't fully recovered yet and you do need to rest - and its normal to feel down sometimes. Make an effort to get in touch with some special friends and don't be scared to ring the ward and keep in touch with friends you made in hospital too. or visit macmillan.org.uk8. Going home 80Leaving the security of the hospital can sometimes feel scary. In hospital there's somebody around all the time if you feel ill or worried. Suddenly at home you can feel marooned and isolated, perhaps worrying that something could go wrong and there'll be no one to help. For example you may go home with a Hickman line (or portocath ) still in place. You will have been shown how to look after this in hospital and you can always phone and check with hospital staff about any worries, day or night.People with cancer can be particularly at risk from infection. The coughs and colds and bugs that other people manage to shake off can sometimes be very serious for you. The ward staff will warn you when you need to take particular care of yourself and also talk through with you how you're going to do it. Even so, there will be occasions when you worry that you have picked up a bug or virus and you need to learn how to recognise signs of infection as well as who to contact if you are at all worried, for example your GP.'Since finishing treatment, I've kept in touch with friends I made through being in hospital. Some of them were diagnosed a year ahead of me, so whenever I have an 'off' day, they can offer me a lot of support and advice based on their own experience. I can say: 'Oh God, did you ever feel like this?' and they'll say, 'Yep, we've been there!' I've been really grateful for having them there for me to help me cope.' Rochelle, 21Managing on your own Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 008. Going home 81How to get help when you're at home 'A Macmillan nurse and a social worker came to visit during the first couple of weeks I was at home. They talked to me and my parents, and checked that we were all coping well. My mum has been the biggest help to me since I've been home - she's like a nurse now!' Jenny, 17 It's important that once you get home you have clear information about who to contact with any queries or concerns. This should be discussed with you before you leave hospital, but it's also a good idea to go through it with your parents and family so that they know what to do if there is a crisis. Make a note of important telephone numbers and contacts and be sure everyone knows where to find it. You or your family can ring the hospital ward for advice at any time, day or night. Never be scared of worrying them unnecessarily. They are there to help you. Your GP and a named community nurse should have been informed that you're going home. Together they will be responsible for your care. You should know their names and contact details before you leave hospital. Also, as soon as you get home, contact your GP's surgery and make sure they know what's happening. or visit macmillan.org.uk8. Going home 82 If problems arise, and you received your treatment a long way from home, it may be possible for you to see a consultant at a local hospital. If necessary, they can arrange emergency admission or arrange to get you back to the hospital where you were treated. It's also very useful for you to have information about other support groups and advisers, such as the local Macmillan nurse, specialist social workers or careline. You will find the numbers for many of these in the contacts section (page 99), but your community nurse will also have details of other local groups. If you have any questions or concerns about your cancer you can call Macmillan. Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 008. Going home 83You may be able to return to school, college or work between treatments. Even if that isn't possible, once your treatment is over and you're feeling well again you'll obviously want to get restarted on your normal life. You may be anxious about mixing with people of your own age, particularly if you look very different. How will friends who haven't seen you for a while react to your hair loss or change in weight? It's a good idea to try to meet up either at home or somewhere where you feel safe before you go back to school or Returning to school, college or work 'My main coping strategy when I was ill was to set targets for myself. One of my key targets was to go back to uni and finish my degree. I've taken a lot of time off to recover after treatment, but I'm planning to go back to uni later this year. Meanwhile, I've kept in contact with my uni mates and we're even going travelling together in Thailand soon.' Tom, 21 work. Invite them round or go to the cinema together.

It's also important that teachers and employers, as well as your friends and colleagues, know something about the effect that the treatment has had on you, as well as any special needs you may have. Either you or one of your parents should get in touch with school or work before you go back and ask for an opportunity to talk this through. or visit macmillan.org.uk8. Going home 84Teachers and employers may not have come up against your illness before. While most of them are supportive, attitudes can vary, and sometimes people are not well informed. You need to be clear about your needs and shouldn't assume that they understand or know anything about cancer because this can lead to misunderstandings. For example, some teachers get cross about pupils wearing hats without realising this may be a way of dealing with hair loss. Explaining this beforehand can usually avoid unnecessary trouble. If you're going back into education, then the school or college nurse should be able to support you and help you talk to staff about anything you need. (The booklet Welcome Back may be useful even though it is written for younger children). Contact Cancer Research UK for details (see Contacts section, page 99). If you're returning to work then aim to inform your line manager (or Human Resources department), in advance. If you're a member of a trade union then your representative could also be a helpful contact. If you're in a large company there should also be an occupational health nurse who can address any issues you may have. Sometimes it is hard to pick up where you left off. Some people can't return to their jobs and, sadly, sometimes employers make it difficult to continue working and attend hospital check-ups etc. If you're not in full time education, and unable to find work, you may be entitled to benefits. You can find out more about these by ringing your local Citizens Advice Bureau or JobCentre Plus (see local phone book). You can also call Macmillan, who can provide details about organisations that can give financial help to young people with cancer (see Contacts section, page 99). In addition, your social worker can help you make an appointment with any benefits officers and/or Citizens Advice workers who visit hospitals on a regular basis. Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 008. Going home 85Everyone changes through life, whether or not they've been affected by illness. Even though you're being treated for cancer, you're still the same person as you were before. It's just that the illness has forced you to think about what makes you tick, as well as raising an awareness of how others see you. You've been through a major trauma and faced things many young people have never even considered. Sometimes cancer and its treatment can interfere with a young person's psychological and emotional development. On the one hand they can become more anxious than they might have been before, but on the other hand they're often more mature than other people of their age - and even many adults. This can make it hard to fit in with your own age group. It may mean you don't have patience with the day to day things that other young people get worked up and anxious about.'My outlook on life has changed and I don't take things for granted as much anymore. I've learned how important it is to have your friends and family around you. My mum and dad helped look after me during chemo when I was feeling really ill, but even after treatment I know it's worth having them nearby just so I can talk to them about how I feel.' Gemma, 19But am I still the same person? or visit macmillan.org.uk8. Going home 86It would be nice to say that the cancer is over and you can put it behind you, but the emotional shock of such a severe illness can stay with people for a long time. Many young people talk about the anger they feel when the treatment is over. At the time when they're battling against the disease they're too busy to be aware of this, but afterwards they feel furious about what has happened to them. Anger can be a destructive force, however. It can stop people settling down and getting on with their life. That's why it's so important to monitor your mood and talk it through with someone you trust if you find yourself becoming worked up. Voicing your feelings really is the best way to make sense of your thoughts and feelings, which frees you up to move on with your life. For most people the answer to this is no, but there is always going to be an element of uncertainty. Because of this risk, it's important that any symptoms are picked up immediately so that treatment can be given as quickly as possible. There is also an increased chance that you may get a different cancer at some stage, but this risk is small. You will have regular medical check-ups - probably for the rest of your life. At first these may be every couple of months or so, but as time goes on you won't need to have them so often. 'I do often wonder if my brain tumour will ever start to grow again. But I don't let it bother me - I just get on with my life now. I could just as easily get run over by a bus tomorrow. There's no point dwelling on it.' Rochelle, 21Will the cancer come back? Call Macmillan on 0808 808 00 008. Going home 87Many people find that joining a cancer support group is a good way of keeping in touch with other people who share your experiences. Even if you don't go to meetings, it's useful to know there's someone you can contact. Keep a list of their numbers handy. Even if you don't feel you'll use it right now, it's good to know you can call upon it if your feelings change. You've done really well to get this far and have shown both courage and determination. There are bound to be times when you feel down, so don't lose sight of the fact that most young people who have had cancer go on to return to good health and achieve the things in life they want - including careers, getting married and having children.'The experience has made me a much more positive person. I don't worry so much now about whether people like me or not. I've also done a lot of charity work that I would never have done before. I even went on stage in the Royal Albert Hall with The Who's Roger Daltrey as part of a fundraising event - that was amazing.' Dan, 20Moving on or visit macmillan.org.uk889. Common questions899.
