but every single person in the UK (not to mention most of the world) would be able to say something similar. And in recent months we as a coll ege have attempted to keep our alumni community informed about what's happening in college rather more frequently than we might otherwise have done; so I shan't repeat in detail what has been said elsewhere. My chief emotion apart from the sadness at leav ing in the middle of this critical period is one of grateful appreciation to so many members of the Magdalene family. The staff of the College have risen to the challenges with immense generosity and energy, and it is impossible to overstate how much we o we to them. They have coped with the various challenges of being furloughed, working from home in often demanding conditions, agreeing to take on new duties and responsibilities and, in all of this, maintaining good humour and positivity. I have no doubt that there have been some draining struggles going on behind this courageous behaviour, but it is all the more impressive that they have been able and willing to go well beyond their normal comfort zones to keep the community safe and stable. Our studen ts have shown the same resilience and energy in all kinds of ways. Although we don't have the usual full range of Tripos results to comment on this year because of some of the new means of assessment that have been necessary, the statistics we do have show that the intellectual performance of our finalists has been well up to the impressive standards of recent years, with an excellent crop of Starred Firsts a nd University and Departmental P rizes. I have been equally impressed by the patience and commitmen t of my colleagues in the Fellowship - and the willingness of some of them to put in eye -wateringly long hours on university as well as college working groups dealing with the management of the crisis. And of course, the response of our alumni has been sup portive, generous, and faithful. You have all of you shown the depth of your commitment in all sorts of ways -and not least in the superb response to our appeal for help with student hardship. In short, the entire Magdalene community has lived up to its9best traditions; we here in Cambridge have felt deeply supported and encouraged. Looking forward, there is no denying that we face a very testing period. Like all the colleges, we are seeing our income dropping as the crisis continues. Rents from local businesses are vulnerable, and we have tried to ease the burden for struggling tenants (especially in the hospitality trade) as best we can. Although our investment performance has been remarkably good, the prospects overall are sobering. We are complete ly confident that we shall pull through this, but we know that we are not going to be exempt from the chill winds blowing through the whole economy. The Senior and Assistant Bursars have been carrying a huge load in these months, and have had to create po licies and make tough decision weekly and even daily at many points. I must pay the warmest of tributes to the quality of their work throughout; they have helped to secure our future as a community and the long hours they have put in to make this a realit y have not gone unmarked. I might add at this poin t that work on the N ew Library B uilding has recommenced, and there is every prospect of finishing this by the end of next term. We were enormously fortunate to have the funds for this in place before the pandemic struck. But I should also take the opportunity for yet another thank you, to all involved with the management of the project, and to our contractors for their steady efficiency and energy. Like every institution in the Western world, we have be en challenged by the issues raised through the Black Lives Matter movement, and the C ollege has begun to shape its response. The webinar on this subject which was broadcast in early July attracted a large number of participants and a very wide range of to ugh and candid questions. We are currently putting together a working group to think through next steps in response. The pandemic has uncovered still further layers of disadvantage in society with the disproportionate infection and death rate among non -white communities in the UK; but, tragic as the facts are, it is vitally important that we see more clearly where and how disadvantage works in our society. And I hope that we shall not, as a society, be too distracted by the headline -grabbing stories about statues and the like. My own sense is not that anyone wants to airbrush our history - simply that it matters to have that history looked at with clarity and honesty. To admit that our 10 forebears - and some of our benefactors - were people of their time, taking for granted injustices we could not now tolerate for a moment should be a mark of strength, not weakness. It is insecure and unstable societies that refuse to face the failings of their history; we can do better than that. We are rightly proud in Magdalene of our s ignificant part in triggering the campaign for the abolition of slavery through the work and witness of Peter Peckard in the 1780s; it is no denial of pride in that legacy to say that other aspects of our past need a critical eye cast on them. We shall be a better and more robust community in college and country alike if we can manage both the celebration and the candid acknowledgement of what can't be celebrated. Who can guess what the climate will be when my distinguished and admired su ccessor sits down to write next year's letter? I hope that he will feel as enthused and inspired as I do by the quality of common life we share and seek to maintain here; I hope that he will have more wisdom than I in handling the unexpected ups and downs of life in college, and that he will enjoy the same level of warm support and affection that has been given by colleagues here and alumni the world over. I hope he and Sue will feel - as Jane and I most emphatically do - that the Mastership of Magdalene i s one of the most rewarding and delightful positions anyone could aspire to. We look back on these nearly eight years with unalloyed pleasure and deep gratitude; and we hope to continue our connections here and to meet up in the flesh as soon as the cloud s beg in to lift. Meanwhile, thanks and every blessing to all. R D W 11 IN MEMORIAM SIMON BARRINGTON -WAR D, KCMG Honorary Fellow The Rt Revd Simon Barrington -Ward, KCMG, MA. Born 27 May 1930.

Married to Dr Jean Taylor, 1963; two daughters, Mary and Helen. Honorary Fellow from 1987. Died on Easter Saturday, 11 April 2020, aged 89. 12 If Simon had not been so hopeless at maths, he would never h ave come to Magdalene as an undergraduate. His family had close Oxford connections, and young Simon was desperate to go to his father's old college there. His Eton tutor, however, was convinced that Oxford would reject him for failing maths, and after lo ng and difficult discussions persuaded him to try for Magdalene Cambridge. Simon won an Open Scholarship in History here in December 1948, and then had to complete eighteen months of National Service with the Royal Air Force before coming into residence i n October 1950. Simon had a famous father, Robert (Robin) Barrington -Ward, DSO, MC, a First World War hero, who became Editor of The Times in 1941. He married Adele Radice, of Italian descent; Simon was the middle of three children. RBW died suddenly fr om an insect -bite when travelling to Dar - es-Salaam in February 1948, when Simon was seventeen. Simon always regretted that his father died just when he himself was of an age to appreciate and learn from Robert's political ideas, but he was aware that his father was supportive (controversially for The Times ) of the post -war Labour Government's social welfare reforms and promotion of Indian independence, and had long believed in evolutionary policies and 'liberating truths, at whatever cost to conventional o pinion' and however painful. These formed the bedrock of Simon's social philosophy. He was a popular History undergraduate, 'a good mixer' with many friends in different spheres. Shortly after the beginning of his second year, he decided to submit himse lf as a candidate for ordination, supported by the Chaplain, Tony Pearce, and his Tutor, Francis Turner, whose recommendation stressed that he was 'a man of marked intellectual ability, lively mind, wide interests, and personal charm'. However, before sta rting theological training at Westcott House, he spent his first year after graduation in 1953 as a Lektor at the Free University of Berlin. This was a profoundly important experience, exposing him not only to German language and literature, but also to i ts religion and philosophy, and especially to the influence of Hegel and the influence of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the pastor and theologian hanged only eight years before, whose inspirational writings were starting to be published. As Simon was finishing his training at Westcott House in the summer of 1956, Tony Pearce as Chaplain of Magdalene was spectacularly successful in being elected to a University Lectureship in Divinity. Naturally enough, he hoped and indeed expected that this 13 could be combined with promotion to a fellowship at Magdalene. The College authorities, however, hesitated to make a tenured appointment and worried about his 'high church' Anglicanism; they denied him a Fellowship. Pearce therefore decided to resign as Chaplain and to leave Cambridge for Australia, where he became a distinguished Canon of Perth Cathedral. The College was likely to be left without a chaplain for the beginning of the new academical year, but realised that Simon was due to be made a Deacon on 30 September. He c ould therefore be appointed Chaplain from 1 October 1956, before his ordination as a priest, which took place the following year. If this was a gamble for the College, it was nothing less than a privileged and exciting opportunity for the youthful new Cha plain. Simon later recalled: From the start I loved it. I was virtually an ordained undergraduate, close to those amongst whom I was working. The Chaplain was a figure accepted by everyone.... The Chapel was almost as much part of the College's life as H all. It was packed out every Sunday evening... Everyone wore one of the surplices that hung in the Ante - Chapel. This and most of the other old traditions were still in operation. All undergraduates had had to declare their religion on their application form. It was not difficult being Chaplain in such a community, and it was hugely enjoyable, joining High Table every night, and talking among others to C S Lewis as a Professorial Fellow. In 1960, with Simon's five -year appointment drawing to a close, he accepted an Assistant Lectureship in Religious Studies at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. This was another formative step for him, opening up the exciting world of Africa, of African religion, and Anglican mission. But in 1963 the College decided to try to tempt him back with the offer of a fellowship and the post of Dean of Chapel which had long been vacant. Simon accepted eagerly, and all seemed to be arranged. Then came the news that Simon was getting married. A shocked and agitated Master (Sir Henry Willink) announced this to the Fellows, suggesting that they could hardly say they didn't want him after all, just because he was no longer unmarried and wouldn't live as a bachelor chaplain in College. The Fellows learned that he had married Dr Jea n Caverhill Taylor, who was practising in Nigeria, the daughter of Dr 14 Hugh Taylor, a medical missionary who had served in China. When Simon and Jean first met, they discovered that each of them had furnished their rooms with identical curtains designed by John Piper. It was a Sign, surely? The College was about to witness an unprecedented double pastorate. At their home in the newly -converted Northampton Street cottages, with the paired Piper curtains now on facing walls, Simon might be in the livin g room giving spiritual comfort and guidance to one undergraduate, while Jean was in the kitchen dispensing medical and psychological aid to another: these rooms could be entered separately, so complete privacy was assured to students seeking their complem entary but equally warm -hearted and understanding practical help. But although many individual members of the College were thus helped enormously, Simon was acutely aware that the overall role of the Chaplain was much diminished. The College was quite su ddenly entering a time of rapid and disconcerting change, the beginnings of an aggressive reform movement known to history as 'the Students' Revolt'. As he recalls: I had returned to a transformed scene. The cultural shock was far greater than anything which the vital spiritual turmoil of Africa had confronted me with.... Amid the welter of cults, enthusiasms, Utopian passions, Chapel had no place. I was part of the rejected 'Establishment'.... The faith I had articulated seemed now too bland and glib. W hat is more, I realised I had become estranged not only from many of those I was trying to reach, but even from my former self. It was a crisis for his ministry. He began to see the limitations of that older comfortable world which had shaped him. The f ramework he had relied on seemed to be falling apart around him. He began to sense something of the impatience of the rebels, to accept the need for evolving change, the need for a genuine 'death and resurrection' in the world and in Magdalene. For a s tart, he embarked upon a radical redesign for the Chapel, encouraged by his friend Jim Ede of Kettles Yard. Out went the last of the Victorian panelling; the ornately carved Edwardian altar was evicted and put into storage, replaced by a serviceable table rescued from an 15 undergraduate room; the walls were repainted in uncompromising 'brilliant' white. Simon wanted to get rid of the Victorian glass windows which made the Chapel dark and dreary, and fill all of them (except the Pugin east window) with plain glass. This would be a major alteration, requiring Governing Body approval. The College's Architect -Fellow, David Roberts, a Welsh Non conformist, supported him, arguing that the Chapel was the chaplain's work -space and he should have as light and modern a facility as possible. The Governing Body was not persuaded (eventually a sensible compromise was adopted, involving the radical modification of the two worst windows, those at the sanctuary end). As the Students' Revolt intensified, Simon thought he m ight usefully act as a go -between, a moderating, reconciling influence. However, a new Master and a traditionalist Bursar were nervous and sceptical about this. It was suggested to Simon that he might like to move on and further his ecclesiastical career . Thus it came about that in 1969 Simon moved to Birmingham to become the first Principal of Crowther Hall training college at Selly Oak, the start of his momentous connection with the Church Missionary Society, of which he was appointed the General Secre tary in 1974. He joined an historic line of leaders of the CMS, all of whom had biographies written about them, in recognition of the importance of their role. Simon was now right at the centre of reconciling modernisation, rejecting the old missionary a uthoritarianism and devising an evolving 'partnership in mission'. He travelled the world, writing a striking series of newsletters about what he found: thoroughly characteristic, stylish reflections, their regular arrival eagerly awaited. They have been published as an anthology, Love will out (1988), hailed as one of the finest statements of 'mission theology' for the late -twentieth century. As the General Secretary, he and Jean lived in a CMS semi -detached house close to the riverside at Twickenham an d the bridge to Richmond. It was here that their daughters Mary and Helen spent most of their childhood. If the General Secretaryship marvellously fitted his talents, enthusiasms and experience, the same was hardly less true of his appointment as Bishop of Coventry in 1985. It was greeted with something like a general acclamation. He received nearly 500 letters of congratulation, including, it seemed, greetings from almost everyone who was anyone in the Church of England, and many others besides. His openness to all things German, and competence in its language, was of 16 especial value in developing Coventry's links of reconciliation with Dresden Cathedral, while his experience of Coventry itself resonated with his own spiritual vision of brokenness follo wed by redemption and renewal. 'Reconciliation' was now a central theme of his ministry: it was something which called for 'the sharing of the gift of forgiving love with others'. If it sometimes called for an unpopular stance in opposition to the govern ment, he took it: his father would have been proud of him. He attacked unconscious racism, opposed the Thacherite poll tax and policy towards apartheid, and joined Archbishop Desmond Tutu in calls to free Nelson Mandela. As Bishop he chaired the Internat ional Affairs Committee of the General Synod Board for Social Responsibility, and the Partnership for World Mission, together with various other bodies. Magdalene was the cherished thread which ran through seventy years of his life. Simon spent a sabbati cal term as Bishop living in Mallory Court. His links with the College were decisively renewed and strengthened with election to an Honorary Fellowship in 1987. When the question of the admission of women to the College became a live issue he seized the chance to set out his vision of what he hoped Magdalene would become by 'transposition'. He wrote as follows: I am sure that it is important that the College can demonstrate that its real character and quality are able to be translated effectively into contemporary terms without being in any way distorted or diminished.... a mixed community in which still, more than ever even, the truly Magdalenian virtues, of humane, Christianly -rooted relationships, of a valuing of the whole person and not just of the intellect, can be cherished and realised, through.... continuing resilience, imagination and readiness for fresh exploration. It was no surprise when Simon and Jean decided to retire to Cambridge in 1997, and live as close to the College as they could. A house in Searle Street was found for them by Rosemary Boyle. They got to know a whole new generation of appreciative students and Fellows. During a term's interregnum in the chaplaincy, Simon was the acting Chaplain. Simon was a man of almost unlimited imaginative insight and cultural breadth and refinement. Many will remember his joyful bursts of song, or his clear calligraphic handwriting, which remained 17 unchanged throughout his life since his early teens. He had a childlike sense of fun, and could s ometimes be seen in full ecclesiastical rig, speeding down Castle Hill into Magdalene Street on his drop -handled racing bike. Inevitably his shortcomings were the obverse of his virtues. The fluency and spontaneity sometimes meant an absence of focus and intellectual control: the sermons that went on too long, the important monographs on Nigerian religion, or contemporary spirituality, which never got written, the muddle that might overtake social engagements. But he made even vagueness seem endearing. He was in some ways a stern and committed pastor, but of great human sensitivity and sympathy, a genuine intellectual with considerable powers of critical judgment and understanding. He had an instinctive gift for kindly, unembarrassed and cheerful friend liness, and he developed into an inspirational figure who could reach out to all sorts and conditions of men and woman. There was a sheer joyful abundance in what he was able to share lovingly with so many others. It was always a joy to see Simon, whethe r for a long and stimulating conversation, or just briefly in passing, for you could always be sure he would greet you with his unquenchable good humour and enthusiasm. 'He was, in the fullest meaning of both words, a Catholic ecumenist, with more than a trace of the mystic.' - Canon Paul Oestreicher. R H 18 PROFESSOR BOYLE'S 'M EMOIR OF S B -W' Simon was Magdalene to me before I knew Magdalene. I first heard of him while I was still at school, from my future stepfather, Rockley Boothroyd (1 957) who told how, as he drove away from the College after graduating Simon shouted out after the departing car (won in a raffle for sixpence) 'Rockley! Read that Bible!' (which Simon had given him some weeks earlier). I was left with the impression of ' Simon B -W' as the central someone -who -knew -everyone in a sunny place peopled with characters from Genevieve or Bachelor of Hearts . When I came up to College myself, though, Simon was Dean of Chapel, having just returned from West Africa, and was already felt to be one of the intellectually more adventurous Fellows. I imagine that was why my Director of Studies, Dick Ladborough, ca lled on Simon's help when I presented him with my first essay in French, on something to do with the relation between prose and poetry. Bemused by my conceptual contortions, Dick asked Simon to work out what on earth I was saying. Simon, acutely, came to the conclusion, 'The author makes in the last sentence a neat get -out from the confusion he has I think created.' On the way to that conclusion, however, he had followed every twist of my shifting definitions, remarking as he did so, in words prophetic o f the whole future of our relationship: 'The synthesis is not Hegel's synthesis, quite.' We spent over fifty years together trying to decide the meaning of that 'quite'. (I believe that when Anglican bishops gathered in conference Simon was known among them as the preacher of the gospel according to Hegel.) Simon's early, and personally decisive, time in Berlin and his openness to German culture made for a special connection between us, as did his devotion to the cause of the reconstruction of Dresden. In later years, as he ascended the church hierarchy, his occasional visits to Magdalene, and especially the sabbatical he spent here while still bishop, were delightful opportunities to hear him talk of Hegel and Nietzsche and Gillian Rose, always seeking the key that would unlock the treasury of ideas he wanted to pour into the book that would bring it all together. In the end he settled for the shortest of books on the shortest of prayers, the Jesus Prayer. Perhaps after all he did find the key he was looking for. For a Magdalene undergraduate in the mid -1960s (the term 'student' was not then current in Cambridge) Simon and Jean's tea - parties in Northampton Street were one of the places, along with the 19 Kingsley Club and the Writers' Circle, where seriou s talk was possible on anything under the sun - I remember discussing P F Strawson's The Bounds of Sense with him when it had just come out and when certainly one of us, possibly both, had yet to read it. Anything you had to tell him about a lecture you h ad been to, a book you had read, something that had happened to you, inspiring or otherwise - Simon would take it up with a deep desire to understand and with an ever -cheerful enthusiasm for the good cause, for any good cause, convinced, and convincing you , that it would somehow prove to be part of the great and as yet undiscerned scheme of all things. He was particularly kind to me when, like many, I suffered something of a breakdown in the approach to finals. Simon embodied both an ideal of Magdalene and a certain reality of it too. The ideal that he communicated to us, who had little knowledge of the serious business of the College's senior members, was the ideal of a cultured society devoted principally to the affairs of the mind and the soul, but resp ectful of physical and practical achievement, whether in politics or mountaineering, and enjoying, in moderation, like Sir Stephen Gaselee, the pleasures of good living; a society of gentlemen, of course, but classless; of Christians, no doubt, but toleran t towards sceptics; of amateurs, yes, but so highly literate, educated, and intelligent that they could, if necessary, match or outdo the professionals. As an image of the College it was a persuasive ideal for Simon to pass on because Simon really did embo dy some of the best aspects of the post -war generation in Magdalene. I have sometimes wondered whether its distinctive character resulted in some way from the undoubtedly powerful influence in those years of Francis Turner, who seems himself to have been cut from rather different cloth (I met him only once). It would be embarrassing to name other examples, living or dead, still in Cambridge or elsewhere, but they have always struck me as sharing a family resemblance with Simon. Gently refined manners; an often diffident charm; a marked sensitivity to the feelings of others and to the nuances of words that reposed, I think, on a never -stated confidence in a common culture, a culture in which everyone deserved respect for occupying their own individual plac e; an equally discreet but always guiding conscience; a disarmingly self -deprecating acceptance of personal limitation. Most people had only some of these qualities, but Simon had them all. He also had something else, perhaps inherited from his father, f or he had some at least of the gifts of a great editor: a huge 20 curiosity, an understanding of the peculiar gifts of very different people, a sense of how they might all be brought together for a common purpose, and a surprisingly persistent determination w hen he knew, or thought, he was right. He had the truly Pauline ability to be all things to all men while remaining unmistakably and unalterably himself. Somehow he even navigated a course in the Magdalene fellowship between those he called 'the College W higs' and the others, whom he did not label but whom I suppose logic would require one to call the Tories. It was his great strength, as it was his weakness, that he always saw the best in everyone, even when it wasn't there. Mickey Dias, who had somethi ng of the opposite failing, at least where his colleagues were concerned, often enjoyed pointing out, sometimes mischievously, sometimes more fiercely (especially in matters of College discipline) how Simon's 'cottonwool', as he called it, had blinded him to the obvious. However, as Mickey's longstanding friend, colleague, and victim, Simon repaid him at his funeral with an exceptionally generous, kind, and insightful memorial address. There were people who sometimes were irritated by Simon, but no one re ally disliked him, and nearly everyone loved him. Even on the darkest day it was a ray of sunshine to see that cheerful enthusiasm in his face. 'Enthusiasm' after all means 'having God inside you', and in that sense there can be no doubt that Simon was an enthusiast. N B 21 IN MEMORIAM JEFFERY LEWINS Life Fellow Jeffery David Lewins. MA, PhD, DSc (Eng) (London). Born 30 November 1930. Educated at Brighton Hove and Sussex Grammar School, RMA Sandhurst 1951 -52; Engineers, 1952, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (Matric 1949); MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, PhD in Nuclear Engineering, 1959; Warden of Hughes Parry Hall, University of London 1968-79; Visiting Professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, 1964 and 1986; Battelle Northwest Laboratories at Hanford; Lecturer University College, Queen Elizabeth College, and Queen Mary College; London DSc (Eng) 1979; Lecturer, De partment of Engineering (CUED) Division A Thermodynamics & Fluid Mechanics, Cambridge, 1985 -98; Fellow of Magdalene and Director of Studies in Engineering, 1985 -98; Praelector 1987 -2006, Life Fellow 1998 -2019; Joined the Institution of Nuclear Engineers 19 59 (Fellow 1970, President,1977 -79); Fellow of the American Nuclear Society 1974. Fellow of Royal Engineers 2009 Married, Sabrina Moss 1959 -9, three children, Lloyd, Eugene, and Shelagh; married Judith Strawbridge, 1995, two step -daughters, Louise and Sara h and six granddaughters. Died 23 August 2019, aged 89. 22 Born in Harrow but moving with his family to Sussex, Jeffery was educated at Brighton Hove and Sussex Grammar School where he joined the Combined Cadet Force and developed his talents as an actor and producer. On leaving school, he joined the army and was selected for officer training at Sandhurst. He came top of his entry of 200 cadets and was awarded the King's Medal, the last awarded by George VI who died shortly before Jeffery's passing out parad e. He was then commissioned in the Royal Engineers (the Sappers) and saw active service in Korea and Germany. During his service in Korea he dealt with old minefields, an extremely hazardous operation requiring great skill and bravery. Also in his time in the army he came to Cambridge to read Mechanical Sciences (at Gonville and Caius) before going to MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he took a Doctorate in Nuclear Engineering. It was while he was at MIT that Jeffery met and married Sabrina. Durin g his army service Jeffery was also appointed Visiting Professor at the University of Washington in Seattle and enjoyed an attachment to the Battelle Northwest Laboratories at Hanford. In 1968 he left the Sappers to be the first Warden of Hughes Parry Hall for the University of London. The Hall housed nearly 300 students, men and women, from all colleges of the university. In London he also began teaching Mathematics, Computing, and Engineering at University College, Queen Elizabeth College, and Queen Mar y College. Remarkably, he undertook a second PhD at Cambridge and was later awarded a London DSc (Eng). Jeffery returned to Cambridge in 1980 to take up a lectureship in the Department of Engineering (CUED) Division A Thermodynamics & Fluid Mechanics, specialising in the teaching of Nuclear Reactor Engineering. He was responsible for setting up a small nucl ear laboratory where students were familiarised with handling radioactive materials and carrying out simple 'counting' experiments. The laboratory is still in use today. He was an active Fellow of the Institution of Nuclear Engineers (INucE, now the Nucl ear Institute), serving as President 1977 -9. He was also a Fellow of the American Nuclear Society and Panel Chairman for the Engineering Council's Quality and Audit Committee. He was twice awarded the INucE Pinkerton Prize for the best paper published in the Institution's journal. In his research in the application and interpretation of mathematical methods to nuclear power problems, Jeffery's focus was 23 on understanding and exploiting variational and perturbation methods, leading to new optimising techniq ues. The scope ranges through reactor kinetics and control, in -core fuel cycle optimisation, heat transfer and thermodynamics; stochastic theory, reliability and safety. When he was elected a Fellow of Magdalene College in 1985 he quickly sought a forensi c understanding of his environment. Sensing a need, he produced within months his 'Guide to the Customs of the Fellowship', a defiantly unofficial booklet offering new (and some surprised older) Magdalene Fellows an idiosyncratic interpretation of the College's traditions and rituals. On his appointment at Magdalene, he succeeded Roger Morris as Director of Studies in Engineering, then as now a subject with one of the largest numbers of students in College. Two years later, when, to his great joy, he was appointed Praelector with responsibility for presenting students for graduation, he brought to the post a touch of grand opera. His popularity kept him in the post until 2006, long past his retirement as lecturer. He was now a College character, whose i ncreasing eccentricities caused much delight. Jeffery in 1985 24 During his period with CUED, Jeffery looked after many research students and published several books and more than 200 papers mostly on nuclear reactor design and operation. Much of his early work has been described by experts in the field as seminal. He was also the editor of two nuclear science journals and a regular contributor to The Royal Engineers Journal . During his time at Magdalene, he built up the College undergr aduate computing facilities from almost nothing and without any professional IT assistance. He was a Trustee of the ADC Theatre and a member of the University's Military Education Committee. Each year, Jeffery set new students a project. One of these was to design a sundial to be placed on the side of one of the buildings in Benson Court. The final design by W F Ng (1987) was cut in stone by the renowned letter -cutter Will Carter, Honorary Fellow of the College. Another project was a Foucault Pendulum w hich hung for many years in O Building stairwell. The pendulum was swung each year by the new students usually followed by the consumption of large quantities of sherry. He was also responsible for reminding everyone that the internal Combustion Engine w as first demonstrated in Cambridge by a Magdalene Fellow, William Cecil , in 1820 and, in commemoration, he arranged for a plaque in the College Chapel. In 1998, Jeffery retired as lecturer and member of the College Governing Body where he had been a meticulous scrutinizer of the GB Minutes. In this, perhaps his finest moment was to ask whether, on the election of a recent Fellow, the porters had indeed b een asked to 'hoist the College fag'. On retirement, Jeffery was given the honorary title of Kipling Fellow in recognition of his great interest in the author. Jeffery always encouraged his students to read and discuss Rudyard Kipling, an Honorary Fellow of the College. Jeffery produced several small monographs on Kipling and helped with the 2015 CUP and College publication of the Magdalene College Kipling Manuscript , a facsimile edition of a thoroughly intriguing manuscript of Kipling 's poems, presented to Magdalene by the poet's widow. Jeffery was a member of the Council of the Kipling Society and until shortly before his death directed a very popular University of the Third Age course on Kipling. Despite slowly losing his sight to ma cular degeneration he courageously continued to play an active part in College, church and local life. He and Judith, whom he married in 1995, continued to attend Chapel Evensong and College functions and dinners until well into 2019 25 and he continued to p erform in the local Gilbert & Sullivan Society. A number of complex mathematical problems kept his mind active as well as challenging his colleagues. In 2001 Jeffery had been given an award by the American Nuclear Society. His academic life is summed up by the citation: for his contribution to teaching and research, especially in reactor kinetics, to the advancement of knowledge through his publications and editing in the field of nuclear engineering and to the welfare of his students. Jeffery will be so rely missed by his colleagues at Magdalene and the Engineering Department, his friends in the local G&S Society, the members of the Kipling Society, and of course by Judith and her extended family. Many will best remember him ( et quis obliviscatur cacchin i eius ?) leading the graduands down Bridge Street, resplendent in full academic dress and with a queue of buses and cars held up behind them. R L S 26 IN MEMORIAM FINBARR LIVESEY Fellow Finbarr Livesey, MPP (Harvard) , PhD. Born February 1972. Educated University College Cork (BSc), Computer Laboratory, Cambridge, 1990 -94; Kennedy School of Government, Harvard 1999 -2001 and University of Cambridge (part -time PhD) 2005 -11. Director of GeoPartners Inc 2001 -02; Director of the Centre for Industry and Government at the Institute for Manufacturing within the Department of Engineering, Cambridge 2004 -12; Acting Director of the MPhil in Technology Policy at the Judge Business School 2012 -13; University Senior Lecturer in Publ ic Policy in the Department of Politics and International Studies (POLIS), Cambridge; Co -Founder of and Director of the MPhil in Public Policy 2013. Fellow and College Lecturer in HPS (Politics) 2017; Survived by Charlotte and their three children . Died 2 September 2019, aged 47. Finbarr was a Fellow of Magdalene for all too short a time. Senior Lecturer in the Department of Politics and International Studies, he was elected Fellow and College Lecturer in HPS (Politics) in 2017. His research focused on the changing structure of the global economy and government's role in supporting innovation and industrial growth, and how policy making changed as a result of political and technological pressures. Originally trained as a physicist with a BSc from Uni versity College Cork, he turned to computer science at Cambridge, before a stint 27 in industry in Nottingham. In 1999 he moved to Harvard where he completed his Masters in Public Policy and assisted in setting up the Open Economies Project at the Berman Kle in Center for Internet and Society. He returned to Cambridge in 2002, working for two years at the Institute for Manufacturing at Cambridge, where he also completed his doctorate on value chains. He joined POLIS in 2013 where he remained deeply intereste d in the challenges posed by technological transformation and considered public policy not just in its technical senses, but also in terms of the economic and political forces which shaped and limited its development. His major monograph, From Global to Local: The Making of Things and the End of Globalisation was published in 2017, and argued with great flair and originality that economic globalisation does not inevitably lead to things being made elsewhere. Technological changes, Finbarr argued, actually tend, in the long term, to restore the rationale for local manufacturing. The book is testimony to his breadth of knowledge and understanding. His final publication, a working paper published with the Bennett Institute, analysed the potential for public ly owned genomic databases linked to health records. Finbarr's POLIS colleagues Dr Dennis Grube and Professor Michael Kenny posted a moving tribute to their friend on the POLIS website: 'It is hard to come to terms with Finbarr passing away, in part because he was a larger -than -life figure. To start with, there was his voice. It had both a timbre and volume that filled not just a single room but resonated through an entire building. As he jokingly reflected on many occasions, he would have made a hopeless secret agent because he could never say anything without everyone hearing within a mile radius. And what a wonderful voice it was. Full of life, humour and intelligence - and occasi onal outrage at the state of the world. His students will no doubt remember that voice fondly - even when it was being used to explain a finer point about statistical methods. Finbarr was integral to the development of the M.Phil in Public Policy (MPP) programme at Cambridge University which started in 2013. He served first as its deputy director and then became director himself when the programme was in its infancy, 28 playing a foundational role as it became one of the leading programmes of its kind within the UK, and indeed globally. Its distinctive composition and signature features - teaching students high -level statistics as well as policy analysis, political science and ethi cs, requiring them to complete a work placement, and ensuring that entrants were in possession of professional experience as well as outstanding academic credentials - reflected his own thinking about the skill -set of a twenty -first century policy -maker. And Finbarr gave himself entirely to the programme's mission and ethos. He loved working with students, debating public policy questions, and testing theories about how policy works. His own training at the Kennedy School infused the thinking vision which he brought to the MPP. This is a legacy that will not fade. It is carried forward by every alumnus of the MPP programme - past and future - who is applying the skills they were taught at Cambridge in governments and organisations in different parts of th e world.... Finbarr was above all things a devoted colleague and friend. He will be greatly missed by colleagues here, and at the Bennett Institute for Public Policy which he was delighted to see come to fruition, having himself been an active proponent of a major inter -disciplinary centre of this kind at Cambridge.' Sadly Finbarr was a Fellow of the College for less than two years before his death from cancer. There was a memorial meeting of remembrance and celebration of his life in the College Hall on 12 September 2019. 29 IN MEMORIAM MICHAEL KEALL Senior Fellow -Commoner Thomas Gerald Michael Keall, MA. Born in Putney, 5 March 1931. Educated as a Chorister at King's College School, 1940 -1945, at Culford School, and King's College Cambridge. 1951 - 1954 (Historical Tripos, Class 2.2; Certificate of Education, 1955). National Service (2nd Lt, Royal Artillery), 1950 -1951. Assistant master, King's College School, 1955 -1957, and at Bedford School, 1957 -1962; Headmaster at the J unior School, Portsmouth GS, 1962 -1969, and of Eastbourne College Preparatory School, 1969 -1977; Headmaster of Westminster Abbey Choir School, 1977 -1987. Junior Bursar of Magdalene College, 1989 -1994, Alumni Secretary, 1999-2012; Fellow -Commoner, 1 Januar y 1989-7 July 2019 (died, aged 88). Michael loved bananas. Presumably they helped to fuel his dynamic energy and never -failing stamina. When the College held an 80th - birthday luncheon in his honour in March 2011, he particularly requested that there sho uld be a banana course. One of his favourite memories was the leaving present (one of a number of gifts) he received as Headmaster at Portsmouth: a procession of wheelbarrows suddenly appeared at his final Assembly, loaded with 400 bananas. The Head Boy declared: 'Sir, we have always known that the way to your heart was via a banana. These are to lighten the emotion of your departure'. 30 His 32 years as a schoolmaster, 26 of them as a headmaster, were full of memories like this, of thoughtful and resource ful schoolboys, of happy incidents which made his career so hugely enjoyable, and reflected his success in it. His first post was back at King's College School, where his pupils included the sons of many of Cambridge's intellectual elite - among them a Po stan, a Keynes, a Boys -Smith - and several destined to have eminent careers, including Dr R N Gooderson, Law Fellow of St Catharine's, Richard Boyd, Fellow of Brasenose, and Adrian Dixon, Professor of Radiology and Master of Peterhouse, 2008 - 16. Then at E astbourne, Michael Fish (weather -forecaster), and Dr David Smith, now a leading historian of the seventeenth century and Fellow of Selwyn, who gave the splendid address at his funeral. From his Westminster choristers, Dr Peter Pugh emerged later as Consul tant Cardiologist at Addenbrooke's, and to Michael's astonishment and delight, treated him when he developed a heart problem. Michael taught History (which he had studied at King's under the legendary Mr Saltmarsh and Christopher Morris), and English gram mar. As a headmaster, he let it be known that he was 'firm, friendly, fair, and can be fierce'. He could relax and be great fun, but he insisted on high standards of personal behaviour. Boys admired and respected him; some were deeply influenced by him, and they became life -long friends. He always hoped he had managed to inculcate in young minds the importance of forming rewarding friendships. From head boy -chorister at King's to taking charge of Westminster Abbey Choir School: this was nothing short o f a dream come true. He especially enjoyed his time at the Abbey, which was an outstanding success from every point of view, and not least because he was able to form a close and fruitful partnership with the Organist and Master of the Choristers, the ebu llient Simon Preston, another Kingsman. It was a golden era for the Abbey Choir. But after ten years there, however difficult the wrench, he felt it would be wise to retire. He then spent the year 1988 travelling around, meeting old friends, and making many new ones in Cape Town, where he bought a flat, with spectacular views of Table Mountain and the University, and the Newlands cricket ground only five minutes away. He attached himself to the Cathedral, where the congenial Barry Smith was the long -serving Organist, and together they contemplated the possibility of setting up a choir school. And then he was excited to be invited to become a governor 31 of the Drakensberg Boys' Choir School of KwaZulu -Natal (founded in 1967), which was now world -famous. H e was accepted into Cape Town's renowned Owl Club. During 1988 he visited over forty vineyards and travelled widely throughout Southern Africa, several of the newly - independent African countries, and Tristan da Cunha. So how did he end up in Magdalene? Q uayside was about to be developed, and the Master, David Calcutt, decided that the burden on the Bursar ought to be lightened by creating a new post taking over responsibility for looking after the domestic arrangements. Ever since Calcutt was an undergra duate at King's, a shared love of music had brought him close to his contemporary Michael Keall (best man at his wedding to Barbara). In July 1988 he sought a meeting with Michael, and persuaded him to apply when the new post was formally advertised at the beginning of September. The Fellows were suspicious of what looked like a magisterial attempt to job in an old crony; some were in any case sceptical about the necessity for the post. However, armed with formidably glowing references from the recently -retired Dean of Westminster (Chairman of the Governors), the Revd Dr Edward Carpenter, and Admiral Sir Derek Empson (Chairman of the Eastbourne Governors) Michael arrived before the College interviewing panel. One of the younger Fellows decided upon a com bative approach: 'It is said by some that the Fellows of this College are a difficult bunch of prima donnas. What makes you think you could cope with such a body?'. To which Michael replied, with some emphasis, 'After ten years dealing with the Chapter o f Westminster Abbey, I think that I could cope with the Fellows of Magdalene'. The panel recommended his appointment. Additional reassurances were given by the former Bursar, Jock Burnet, who had long known and liked Michael, through their joint interest in schools and games. Always hating his names Thomas and Gerald, by this stage of his life Michael had become accustomed to being called 'Archie'. Calcutt laid down the law: 'You cannot be called Archie any more; in Magdalene you will be known as Michae l...And you must get to know the junior members as well as the Fellows'. Michael was told he was the first prep - school headmaster ever to be elected to an Oxbridge fellowship (though there was a movement in the opposite direction when a former Master of Mag dalene retired into prep -school teaching). So Michael felt that he had had the most amazing piece of good fortune in coming to Magdalene, 32 and he was determined to make the most of returning to Cambridge. For the next thirty years, he attended every Evens ong at his beloved King's, and Sunday Evensong in Magdalene, except when he was away on his annual winter visit to Cape Town. He relished the opportunity to make friends with a wider range of people, not least with the 'junior members' (henceforth to incl ude our first women), aided, he thought, by 'a grandfatherly age -gap'. Unusually, perhaps, for a man who had such a positive rapport with prep -schoolboys, he soon proved to have an equal empathy and enthusiastic interest in university students, irrespecti ve of gender, and indeed, with the ageing cohorts of the whole wider Magdalene community of Non -Resident Members. For the College it proved to be extremely beneficial to have this supreme extrovert counter - balancing the research preoccupations of the Fell ows, not perhaps all prima donnas, but certainly leaning towards introversion. Michael was always an enlivening, astringent, and energising presence. He could be relied on to talk easily and entertainingly about what he had been doing. But what he told you was always focussed on the other people he had been meeting, or on the events he had been to; it was never directly about himself. We therefore remained almost entirely unaware of the brilliance and range of his talents and accomplishments, the sheer extent of his multifarious interest and connections. Michael was absolutely clear in his own mind that his thirty years in Magdalene were the happiest years of his remarkable life. They did not, it is true, bring him the same deep satisfaction he had derived from being a headmaster, but Magdalene brought him, he said, untold joy, 'joys beyond price', and, he claimed that 'no man has ever been more richly blessed'. Typically excessive, of course, but his passionate engagement with the College, and his enormous affection for it, are beyond doubt. His generous benefaction to it. and the Memorial Fund established in his name, will long remind us of that. Perhaps his main achievement as Junior Bursar was, by careful development of the role, to convince Fe llows that the post should become permanent (though with a different title), when it might so easily have been transitory. After the expiry of his five -year contract, a little later, in 1999, he entered into another pioneering appointment, as the first Al umni Secretary. This was where he really came into his own, taking endless trouble in warmly welcoming members returning for reunions, making congenial arrangements and seating -plans for them, choosing wines and 33 menus and the best possible speakers. Undo ubtedly he made the alumni feel they still belonged and were valued by the College. He also helped to start and organise regular Non -Resident Dining Nights at High Table, a much appreciated innovation. For the Fellowship, he instituted the liqueur parti es at the end of Christmas Lunch. The sight some 80 assorted liqueur bottles, patiently and lovingly laid out, was a privileged and joyous sight indeed. The liqueur party was originally in the Parlour as set out here but later moved to the Senior Combin ation Room. Part of the remit of the new Alumni Secretary was to superintend the production of a computerised data -base, a publishable historical register, of all current members. With no modern technological skills himself, this proved to be one task w hich defeated him. He did not get on (yes, it occasionally happened) with the man employed to do the computer programming, being frankly contemptuous of what he regarded as his sad inattention to detail . And with Michael endlessly checking for consistent punctuation, progress was painfully slow. The project was eventually abandoned. Maybe the project was just too big, and Michael's micro - management methods lacked the wide -ranging ruthlessness required to control it. He was an undoubted master of the s mall -scale. And prep - However, all the raw material, the A4 sheets of replies to a standard questionnaire, as returned by members, has been carefully preserved in three large boxes in the College Arc hives. school s, after all , are small aren as (thre e dozen boys at the Abb ey Choir School). In almost all things, he was meticulous to a fault: punctili ous in letter-writin g, proud of his punctualit y, minutel y organise d in routine and record-keeping, eve n adep t at the miniaturisati on of handwriting (micrography). He was a precisian in most things. The one major and alarming exception was his car-driving. Well, shall we say it was less than precise. An example (1996) of Michael's smallest handwriting, reproduced here close to exact size. Note the joke at the end: 'I prefer not to write so large'. Written with an Edring 001. Nowhere was his extraordinary attention to detail more evident than in the way he conducted his relationships. He had a prodigious memory not just for names and faces but also for career-details. He kept a visitors' book at his house, in which guests were invited to write, Michael then adding a note on the facing page. It became a remarkable historical document. Every year he despatched around 600 Christmas cards (reduced from an earlier 800), all with an appropriate personal message in his distinctive and always highly legible handwriting; it was a task which he gently spread over several months. Some of his contacts were maintained through membership of various clubs, all the way from the Athenaeum to the Crudge Club of Chichester, from the CU Rugby Club and the Hawks' Club of Cambridge to the Gangsters (for prep - school headmasters, of which he was joint founder). He had a genius for friendship. One might be forgiven for thinking that his friends became not only his principal hobby, but his whole life indeed. Yet it was not so. His life was grounded in at least two other major commitments. The first was choral music, to which he brought an acute and sensitive ear, an almost unrivalled knowledge, experience, and 34 35 informed understanding of the Anglican choral tradition, friendly with many of its leading, and some of its most promising, exponents. (He was also an accompl ished pianist, but never seemed to bother with it.) The second was his intense devotion to cricket, sustained over seventy years. As a schoolboy and undergraduate he was an acclaimed cricket captain and exceptionally stylish batsman; he was elected a mem ber of Surrey County Cricket Club in 1946, aged 15, and awarded an honorary life membership in 2016. He was also a loyal member of several other cricket clubs, including MCC from 1963, and the Hampshire Hogs. Naturally he loved the technicalities of musi c and cricket, and he mastered them both completely, but choirs and cricket were also a means to foster friendships. And his contacts with other people were in the last resort what really mattered to Michael. As David Smith has so aptly said: 'Michael's love of people and his huge enthusiasm were evident in everything he did. He was a life -enhancing and life -affirming person, with a gift for boosting one's confidence and making one feel valued and appreciated, and it was perhaps this quality above all that made him such an ideal friend and mentor of so many people. His passing leaves behind a huge gap, but also an abundance of happy memories. We are all greatly the poorer for his passing, but greatly the richer for having known him. He was a wonderful man, and may he rest in peace.' R H 36 IN MEMORIAM SIR JOHN TOOLEY Honorary Fellow Sir John Tooley, MA. Born 1 June 1924 in Rochester, Kent. Educated, Repton School, Derbyshire and Magdalene College (1942); assistant adjutant Rifle Brigade, 1942 -5; Secretary, Guildhall School of Music,1952 -55; assistant to the General Administrator, Royal Opera House 1955 -60 and Assistant General Administrator, 1960 -70, General Administrator, 1970-80, Director 1980 -88; Trustee, Walton Trust, Britten -Pears Foundation, Southbank Centre, Welsh National Opera. Knighted 1979. Honorary Fellow 2005. Married Judith Craig (n\u00e9e Morris) 1951 (div 1965), Patricia Janet Norah n\u00e9e Shannon) 1995 (div 2003). Survived by his partner, Penny Souster, his four children, seven grandchildren and three great -grandchildren. Died 18 March 2020, aged 95. 37 Born in Rochester, Kent, John Tooley was the son of Harry Tooley, an Admiralty civil servant, and his wife, Rachael (n\u00e9e Craske). After Repton School, he won a place at Magdalene to read classics and history in 1942. During or shortly after his undergraduate years, he redirected his early ambition to become a professional singer towards music administration. War inte rrupted this single -minded determination and he entered the Rifle Brigade, but afterwards friends advised him to work in industrial management for a few years to prepare himself for his planned career. He was soon serving as Secretary of the Guildhall Sch ool of Music and Drama, and in 1955 was invited to join the staff of the Royal Opera House as assistant to David Webster, its General Administrator. In 1960 he became Assistant General Administrator, a role that gained greater importance owing to Webster' s ill-health, whom he duly succeeded in 1970. A year earlier he had been founding Chair of the Dramatic and Lyric Theatre Association, whose aim was to revitalise touring in Britain (at the time neither the National nor the RSC toured). John was knighted in 1979, and in the following year his job title was changed to General Director of the Royal Opera House. From then until his retirement in 1988, he oversaw one of the liveliest periods of artistic creativity and ordered management in the history of the House. The opera critic, Harold Rosenthal acclaimed his role in coordinating the operations of major European and American opera houses, promoting regular meetings of the heads of those houses, sharing costs by staging co-productions, and resisting exces sive fees for prima donnas (and primo uomos). To attract younger audiences, John also established a series of 'promenade' opera performances, with low -priced admission to stalls areas without seats. At the same time, the organization developed in many con structive ways: in succession to Georg Solti, Colin Davis was Music Director for most of John's tenure, and the Opera House, in addition to its international recognition, retained the nucleus of a native company, something that was subsequently lost. In p artnership with Davis, John encouraged the retention of British artists, expanded the choice of opera directors, and staged many innovative productions (a few, too innovative for audiences and critics alike). In the mid -1970s, his support for a collaborati on between Davis and the East German director Gotz Friedrich brought about an exhilarating production of Wagner's Ring cycle. John also encouraged Elijah Moshinsky to direct historic stagings of Britten's 'Peter Grimes' in 1975, Saint Pl\u00e1cido Domingo ) in 1987. Domingo became a regular visitor, along with many other major singers including Kiri Te Kanawa and Thomas Allen. The link s John forged with administrators in other countries led to an exchange of productions, notably visits to Covent Garden by the Bavarian State Opera in 1972 and by La Scala, Milan, in 1976. Another of his achievements was his collaboration with successive ballet directors Kenneth MacMillan, Norman Morrice and Anthony Dowell to confirm the Royal Ballet's as a company of world status, and to encourage its work abroad (a tradition that continues). At the same time, he expanded the reach of the company, includi ng experimental ballet in a tent in Battersea Park and hugely successful live screenings in the Covent Garden piazza. In 1970, the Royal Ballet's touring company returned to Sadler's Wells theatre in north London, and as the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet fro m 1977, John searched for a new base for it outside London. One was secured shortly before his retirement and realis ed in 1990 with the establishment of the Birmingham Royal Ballet. John departed Covent Garden in 1988, a year after ensuring Bernard Haitink's succession as Music Director. In retirement, he served on the boards or trusts of numerous arts organizations, including the Walton Trust, the Britten -Pears Foundation, the Sidney Nolan Trust, Welsh National Opera, and the Rudolf Nureyev Foundat ion. When he published his memoirs, In House : Covent Garden, 50 Years of Opera , in 1999, Russell Twisk wrote in The Times that 'his regime is now regarded as a golden era when the opera house could still attract stars such as Maria Callas, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Rudolph Nureyev'. But Twisk also added that these were 'tempestuous times' and 'n ot everything flourished'. An obituary by the distinguished music critic, the late Alan Blyth, complai ns that sometimes cast and directors were selected only because they were established 'names', but that John was 'on the whole, successful in his personal relationships with artists, always hastening backstage after a first night and, as far as possible in difficult circumstances, maintaining good relations with stage staff. Many College members will recall an urbane and highly sociable companion. He was also reasonably successful in managing the vexed question of finance, ever Covent Garden's Achilles heel.' Blyth also concluded, -fellow -well -met front, and apparent sang -froid in face of the inevitable crises inherent in his job, did not completely mask 39 the iron hand behind it. Only a tough carapace would have ensured his lengthy peri od as head of a many -faceted and often rebellious organization.' His book Ballet, published in 199 9, offered not only a candid assessment of his own achievements but some trenchant and stern criticism of his successors together with a blueprint of what wa s needed for the future. J R R 40 IN MEMORIAM HENRY LUMLEY Honorary Fellow and Benefactor Henry Robert Lane Lumley, MA, born 29 December 1930. Educated Eton College and Magdalene College (1950). Honorary Fellow 1998. Married Sheena 1959 (d 2017), three children, n ine grandchildren and one great -granddaughter. Died 6 May 2020, aged 89. Henry Lumley was born in Park Lane, London (the place of his birth reflected in his full name) but moved to Windlesham with his parents in 1944, while he was at school at Eton. After National Service in the East Surrey Regiment, he arrived at Magdalene in 1950 to read law. Although tempted to pursue a legal career, he joined the family business of Edward Lumley & Sons who were insurance brokers at Lloyd's of London, and as a result spent 1957 in Australia and New Zealand. He continued to visit both count ries once or twice a year, and his final visits (to his 41 daughter in Melbourne and son in Sydney) were completed only six weeks before his death. Having built up Edward Lumley Holdings Ltd into a large and highly successful insurance operation, he retired as its Chairman in 2003, when it was sold to an Australian company. As a businessman for over fifty years, he developed an acute awareness of the skills of management, both financial and strategic. Throughout his life, he was a firm believer in giving sup port back to the community and helped many charities with both knowledge and financial assistance. He founded the Henry Lumley Charitable Trust to help medical research and education development which he chaired until his death. In 1984 he joined the Cou rt of Patrons of the Royal College of Surgeons to which he continued to offer munificent support. He founded Windlesham Golf Club in 1997, was Chairman of Windlesham Golf Management Ltd which oversaw the golf course built on his own land, and for the last twenty -five years he served as President of Windlesham Bowls Club. He was also a strong supporter of his local Conservative Association and joined the Magna Carta Club as a Founder Member. Above all, he repeatedly expressed his belief that the foundati on of his life derived from the educational opportunities he received at Magdalene. And he was a remarkable and tireless benefactor, truly interested in the College, our plans for the future, and hugely generous with his support of students and those who needed financial assistance to enjoy everything that Magdalene and Cambridge had to offer . In 1968 he endowed and Official Fellowship. He established the Henry Lumley Bursary Fund and immensely enjoyed reading annual reports from students who have benefi tted from his generosity during their time at Magdalene. In 1994 he also endowed a second fellowship, the H R L Lumley Research Fellowship in the humanities, which has provided three years of invaluable support to a succession of early -career scholars of international distinction. Given the increasing difficulties for young academics in securing post -doctoral positions, such support is beyond measure; several generations of gifted scholars who will go on to develop their subject, publish their research an d teach countess others, will be forever in Henry's debt. Most recently, his liberality helped in no small part to launch, with a feasibility study, the College's New Library project. He was already a staunch and engaged supporter of the Pepys Library - with his eye on one occasion drawn to an early owner's name 'Lumley' inscribed in large letters on a manuscript of Ovid (John, 1st Baron 42 Lumley, c 1533 -1609). Admitting to feeling a special affinity with this book, he took a special interest in learning m ore of its history. In the New Library he remained keenly interested, studying the developing plans, noting details and discussing the concept of the building with members of the development committee. He pledged generously towards the building and he wi ll be proudly listed among its Principal Benefactors . His son Peter writes: He always much enjoyed the fellowship and friendship of Magdalene and Cambridge... and would often talk about these visits to me. I am so pleased to hear he was able to assist in getting the library project up and running. I know he was very excited about it and was only talking to me about it a few weeks before he died.

Her father, the Right Reverend Geoffrey Paul, former Bishop of Bradford, was then serving as a missionary priest at Palayamkottai and later Kerala. Her father was a member of the faculty and later became the principal of the Kerala United Theological Seminary at Kannammoola, where she spent part of her childhood. She studied theology at Clare, Cambridge, and then worked in theological publishing and education. For three years she wrote a Sunday readings column for the Church Times (published by SPCK as Lectionary Reflections ) and then worked part -time for Redemptorist Publications. After teaching at Trinity College Bristol, she became a Visiting Lecturer at King's College London, but continued to travel and lecture extensively aro und the world. She was a founding member of the theology faculty at St Mellitus College (formerly St Paul's Theological Centre) in London, where she became Lecturer and Assistant Dean, and has recently been appointed Mc Donald Professor in Christian Theolo gy. Her books include Approaching Christmas, Angels, Bread, Wine and Women (with Sue Dowell), Perfect Freedom , and Approaching Easter . In 2013, she took up residence in the Master's Lodge at Magdalene with her husband, Rowan, to whom she has been married since 1981; they have one daughter and a son. BRENDA HALE, Baroness Hale of Richmond, retired in January 2020 as President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the apex court for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. She was educated at Richmond High School for Girls, in North Yorkshire, and Girton College, Cambridge, where she is now Visitor, and called to the Bar by Gray's Inn. After graduating, she spent 18 years teaching, researching and writing in Law at the University of Mancheste r, also practising for a while at the Manchester Bar. She then became a member of the Law Commission, a statutory body which makes proposals for the reform of the Law. Her proudest achievement there was the Children Act 1989. In 1994, she was appointed a High Court Judge, the first to have made a 48 career as an academic and public servant rather than as a top barrister. In 1999 she was promoted to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales and in 2004 became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in the House of Lord s, the first and sadly the only woman ever to hold that office. In 2009 the 'Law Lords' were transformed into Justices of the newly established Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. She became its Deputy President in 2013 and President in 2017. On 24 Sep tember 2019, she announced the unanimous decision of the court in the case of R (Miller) v The Prime Minister [2019] UKSC 41. MICHAEL CORMAC NEWELL graduated from Magdalene in 1963 and started work at Granada TV on its Graduate Trainee scheme in Manchester. He began directing immediately after training, with The Evening News in Welsh, Professional Wrestling and anything that nobody else would volunt eer for. He then started to direct drama - eight months on Coronation Street -and from that to one -off plays. After Granada he freelanced, mostly at the BBC's posh plays department - a very vibrant place. Writers David Edgar, Jack Rosenthal, David Hare and Howard Brenton, Clive Exton, Tom Stoppard and many more were producing work there. He also made one-hour TV films: 'Ready When You Are Mr McGill', 'Destiny', 'Baa Baa Blacksheep' , among others. Following a spell at CBC in Toronto, he then came home to make his first big film, 'The Man in the Iron Mask'. In Hollywood he made a movie with Charlton Heston, and when back home began the struggle to find scripts and projects that he could connect with. A theatre or opera director often has the luxury of wo rking on established texts with rich, supportive back -histories, a screen director gets one shot. Some work, some don't. 'The Good Father', 'Dance with IV', 'Guernsey' worked. Other didn't but were cherished anyway. He was awarded the Prix Italia, two BAFTAs, a Hollywood BAFTA, a French Academy 'CESAR', the Prix Jeunesse from Cannes, and an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. He enjoys teaching (NYU Tisch School of Performing Arts, National Fi lm and TV School) and is an Honorary Doctor of Arts at the University of Lincoln and at the University of Hertfordshir e. He is married to the actor Bernice Stegers. They have one daughter and one son . 49 DAVID HOYLE was born in Rossendale in Lancashire. He went up to Corpus, Cambridge, on an open scholarship, to read History and switched to the Theology Tripos at Part II. A Lightfoot Scholar, he completed a PhD under Professor Duffy's supervision on the reaction to Calvinism in early seventeenth - century Cambridge, published as Reformation and Religious Identity (2007). Ordained in the Church of England in 1988, he served on Cambridge's Arbury Estate before returning to university life as Chaplain (later Dean of Cha pel) at Magdalene in 1988. He was one of the four authors of A History of Magdalene College Cambridge 1428 -1988 published in 1994. He left Magdalene in 1995, to become a v icar in North London and then went to Gloucester as Director of Ministry and a cano n residentiary. In 2010 he was appointed Dean of Bristol and was quickly plunged into an Occupy crisis. Later, he was involved in the debate about the legacy of the transatlantic slave trade. On leaving Bristol he was appointed MBE for services to the c ommunity, particularly for his work in co -ordinating charitable support for the elderly. The University of the West of England conferred on him a DLitt honoris causa . In November 2019, he was installed as the 39th Dean of Westminster and Dean of the Orde r of the Bath. He has published works of theological reflection The Pattern of Our Calling (2016) and A Year of Grace (2019). He is mar ried to a Primary School head teacher and has two children. KATIE DERHAM is a broadcaster and journalist. She joined the College in 1988 to study Economics, part of the first cohort of women undergraduates. Taking full advantage of the lack of competition, she represented the college at netball, athletics and swimming, and captained the women's cricket team. She took p art enthusiastically in college and university orchestras and dramatic productions, was an active member of CULES, JCR T reasurer, and was on the editorial committee for the Varsity Handbook . On reflection she should probably have spent more 50 time in the Economics Library. Soon after graduation she joined the BBC, first as a secretary, and then as a business journalist working for BBC Radio and TV. In 1997 she joined ITV News as Media and Arts Correspondent, and in 1998 became (then) Britain's youngest e ver national newsreader. In 2010 she combined her love of music with her professional life as presenter of the BBC Proms, something she has done ever since. She is also the presenter of Radio 3's In Tune drivetime programme. In 2015, Katie also set up h er own production company and comms agency, 'Peanut and Crumb'. She is a proud ambassador for a number of charities in the fields of Dementia care and research and Music Education. She is a long serving member of the Cambridge University Alumni board and has been very happy to remain an active member of the Magdalene community. In 2019 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the University of Chester. Visiting Fellows During 2019 -20, we were pleased to have with us: Dr Meng -Shan Tan, Chine se Yip Fellow , whose work focuses on the genetics, biomarkers, preventions and therapies for Alzheim er's disease, and who was the recipient of the 2014 International Scholarship Award from the American Academy of Neurology.

The numbers in each class were as follows: Class 1, 48; Class 2.1, 42; Class 2.2, 3; Pass, 56. The number of Firsts awarded by subject were: Archaeology, 1; Architecture, 3; Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, 1; Chemical Engineering, 3; Classics, 4; Computer 7; Mathematics, 1; Modern and Medieval Languages, 4; Natural Sciences, 14 ; Philosophy, 1; Theology and Religion, 1. Starred Firsts were awarded to: I Coats (Archaeology); E Waters (M odern and Medieval Languages); M C Lupoli (Geography); B C Davidson (Theology, Religion and Philosophy of Religion). Advanced students (not classed in Tripos) who obtained Distinctions: H Cooper, R Philips (Final MB). University Prizes were awarded as follows: Niamh Ryan (Chemical Engineering Tripos, Part IIB): T R C Fox Prize; Benjamin Davidson (Theological and Religious Studies Tripos, Part IIB): Theological Studies Prize ; Mia Lupol i (Geographical Tripos, Part II ): William Vaughan Lewis Prize . Senior Tutor's Report Preliminary and Tripos examinations were severely disrupted because of the pandemic with exams taken online. As a result, most first and second year exams were unclassed, were designed as a straightforward test of progress made during t he year, and all students in the first two years have been 'allowed to progress' to the next year. All final -year undergraduate students and fourth -year students on integrated Master's programmes had the opportunity to receive a classed degree. Similarly , most third -year students on integrated Master's programmes had the opportunity to receive a classed degree, if it was necessary for their progression to the fourth year of study or if they intended to graduate 55 after their third year. The University also adopted a so -called 'safety net' for final -year undergraduate students (and for certain integrated Master's students). This meant that, as long as a final -year undergraduate student passed their assessments, they would not receive a class lower than the class they were awarded in their second -year exams in the same or different Tripos. The 2020 assessments only confirm therefore the class awarded in their second year or improve it. Hence, if a student was awarded a 2.1 in their second -year exams, they did not receive a class lower than a 2.1. Most of the final -year assessments which undergraduate students must pass took place in the main assessment period in June, but some are taking place in September, depending on individual circumst ances (and this will be after the time of writing). Magdalene students who were classed (those in years three and four) did extremely well and a number of Prizes, Distinctions , and Starred Firsts were awarded. Although figures are somewhat skewed by 'Passes', 72% of the third and fourth years combined recorded a First or a 2.1. If we include all those who 'passed' then this figure rises to 97%, and even in a world stymied by algorithms and statistics, the wider Magdalene family can heartily congratulate our new graduates on a very successful undergraduate career, completed under extraordinarily trying circumstances.

A busy start to the year for the newly -elected JCR committee began with a refreshers' week organized by Freshers' rep, Caitlin, who also hosted the ever -popular ' Marriage Formal' for first year s. The week ended with a 'Pyjama Party' bop organised by Ents 'officer, Alice. Sadly, because of lockdown, this was to be the last bop of the year. In early February about 100 of us travelled to Oxford for our annual Magdalene -Magdalen Sports Day, compe ting in several different sports. There was great success in hockey and darts; the rugby team put in a valiant effort on the pitch despite the absence of their injured captain and talisman Tommy Bilclough, and lost by one try. The day was hugely enjoyabl e for all involved and we are very excited to be hosting Magdalen in Cambridge next year. Access Work was very busy and led by Access officer Alex, who organised school visits, including one from Rainhill school, and worked with CUSU on their shadowing sc heme. He also organised Magdalene's first ever Access/Class Act Formal at the end of term . Welfare officers, Gabrielle and Tom, continued to run welfare doughnuts, sexual health clinic s, and much student welfare work behind the scenes. Women's officer E mma finished term by organising a fundraiser brunch for Plan UK and Cambridge Women's Aid on International Women's Day. After lockdown, the committee organized yoga sessions, welfare tea, a virtual pub quiz, Magdalene Kahoot, and an Easter egg hunt for those remaining in College. 59 Middle Combination Room. J Ball: President; A D Bresgi. Freshers' week welcomed 80 new faces to the MCR, and the Michaelmas Term MCR bop was the largest ever with over 150 attending from across the university. The term concluded with a very enjoyable Christmas banquet, while Lent offered 'welcome back' events, the Burns Night Ceilidh, movie nights, Formal swaps and international food nights. In Easter Term most MCR activity had to be put on hold but we tried to maintain the closeness of the community from a distance. An online formal H all was well attended and spirited, while in a running challenge (on Nike Run Club) 19 members completed the 60km within the target of a month. Sofia Carozza won, finishing in a remarkable time of 1 day 9 hours and 50 minutes! An art competition with the theme of 'regeneration' was won by Liz Killen with a beautiful M agdalene piece (see below). 60 Welfare remained a key concern given the lockdown, and the committee focused on how best to support the community through this time. Weekly virtual yoga sessions received much positive feedback, and welfare resources and a survey were sent out asking 'How can the MCR help you?' with a buddy system implemented to foster new relationships and combat loneliness. Dan Bresgi (Social Officer) held a wonderful MCR pub quiz by Zoom, and Roan Runge (Women and non -binary officer) org anised a book group to discuss Revolting Prostitutes by Juno Mac and Molly Smith, generating a thought -provoking discussion on sex work in contemporary life. Hector Barbosa (LGBTQ+) tested members' knowledge of LGBT history and current affairs with an LGB T themed non-pub quiz. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Fardin (BAME Officer) supported the MCR's BAME community from her home in Martinique, with members concerned about the disproportionate impact of Covid -19 on global BAME communities. Some reported experiences of discrimin ation, racism and micro -aggression since the start of the Covid -19 outbreak, as well as distress caused by hate -speech comments and the manner of reporting disproportionate deaths. A virtual and chill meet -up was organised for the MCR BAME community. 2 SOCIETIES, CLUBS AND SPORTS The Editor receive d the following reports for 2019 -20: Football Club . (Captains: J Curson and J Hunt). The 2019 -20 has been a mixed season for the Magdalene Football club. We started the season by strongly beating Cla re's first team in a hard -fought 3 -2 victory. Following this, the club managed to win three of the following five games to consolidate its position in Division 3. In Cuppers, we were drawn against Fitzwilliam 1st team - this year's winners of the premier division. After holding out for much of the first half, Fitzwilliam's class prevailed and we were knocked out in the first round. One of our final games of the season was the annual Magdalen -Oxford match. It was a great day out, but with their strong in take of Freshers and enthusiastic supporters, they managed to beat us. 61 Mixed Lacrosse (Captains: O McLuskie and A Barker). Following a very successful 2018 -19 year with the Magdalene Sitting Dragons winning Cuppers, we were sad to say goodbye to many of our graduating players. So, the year began with a big recruitment effort! With a majority of beginners in the first division team it was a steep learning curve for many and the team dropped to the second division in Lent. But this made for much more relaxed and friendly games, the team winning the first two games of the term against the Vets and Downing. Sadly, our winning streak was cut short by a string of cancelled matches because of gale force winds and waterlogged pitches , and eventually Cuppers was also cancelled. All in all, a rather shortened season but with some great matches and stellar performances. The Mixed Lacrosse Team Magdalene College Rugby Union Football Club (Captain: T Bilchough). There was an abundance (maybe even a surplus) of jou\u00e9 to be found in the MCRUFC ranks during the 2019 -20 season. Although the squad was depleted by the departure of our 2019 graduates, the recruitment of a fresher triumvirate in the form of Alex 'Salad' Davies, Al ex 'Cigmun' Froud and Howard Hawkes ensured a replenishment of talent. An emphatic win on the first weekend against Emmanuel led to further victories against CCK and St. Catha rine's, before our first loss of Michaelmas against Queens' away - but Schusy [ P Schusman] gained a winning blue in the 2019 VM. Having never beaten Magdalen Oxford in 62 the annual sister college derby, and with a 70 -point deficit two years before, Les Gar\u00e7ons Violets interpreted the eventual 5 -0 loss as a moral victory and beat them o ff the pitch afterwards. The season's zenith was the match against St John's Flair XV who turned up with none of the flair and all of the XV; we turned up with all of the flair but none of the XV. Thirteen blokes from MCRUFC took down a twenty -four -man squad from St John's, winning 29 -27 in a gripping game of rugby. James Elms and Joe Barnes defended heroically on the try-line, nursing hangovers from the Pepys Dinner the night before. Unfortunately, the Cuppers run ended prematurely with a 25 -15 loss against Churchill in the Bowl semi -final, but the Rugby Dinner later that day provided a fitting conclusion to the season. As a contact -based sport, rugby inevitably suffered from the lockdown measures but MCRUFC also lost its role -model and stalwart Jeremy B ennett who completed his PhD, as well as third year MMLers and serial joueurs Arthur Cross and Hector O'Neill (Vice -Captain). Nonetheless, the club is set to flourish in 2020 -21 under Salad's leadership, with Froud and David Yates serving as playing and n on- playing Social Secretaries respectively, and Howard Hawkes as Recruitment Officer. It's been a pleasure, not out.

The first thing to report is the immense gratitude to our staff for their hard work, resilience and cheerfulness under unique and difficult circumstances in the second half of the annua l cycle. But let's not forget the first half of the year: preparations in the College Library for the move to the new building, re -cataloguing of books, the enhancement of the Pepys Library, the series of monthly exhibitions in the Old Library, the complet ion of the book cleaning programme, the packaging of Archival material, and many other projects. Before anyone had heard of Covid -19, the achievements of the libraries were impressive. Personnel Dr Matilda Watson, College Archivist, has been on matern ity leave, and will return in January 2021. 64 Ms Mandy Marvis joined us as assistant to Dr Hughes for the Legacies of Enslavement Project. Ms Mhairi Rutherford was our summer intern in 2019, working on the Ferrar Project. The Libraries were pleased to have graduate helper Sophia Ponte. The Historic Libraries The Pepys Library has significantly enhanced its 'visitor experience' during the public opening hours by introducing a digital interactive screen in the lobby area. Initially developed in collaboration with the National Maritime Museum for their 'Samuel Pepys: Plague, Fire, Revolution' exhibition, the screen displays three extracts of Pepys's diary, and by running a finger over the shorthand a transcription appears. Additional information to give histo rical context to the diary is also included and it is a v ery attractive addition to the L ibrary. A presentation about the interactive screen was given by the Deputy Librarian at the annual 'Special Collections Colloquium' for Cambridge library staff. Additional advertisement during the University Festival of Ideas fortnight attracted hundreds of visitors to the Pepys Library, where we hosted a major exhibition of Magdalene's special collections on the topic 65 of 'Book Production: Traditions and Innovation s', curated by the Pepys Librarian, the Deputy Librarian and the Libraries Assistant. The Library received many visits from pre -booked groups, school parties, conference groups and our 'regulars', including those from the U3A, the University popular cultur e seminars and the Friends of the Pepys Library. It was a special pleasure to welcome visitors from 'Winter Comfort', a charity working with the homeless community in Cambridge. The Friends of the Pepys Library were treated to a lecture by the Radio 3 p resenter Lucie Skeaping about the Library's broadside ballad collection as part of the Friends annual lecture series. Jennifer Potter gave a talk on her book, The Jamestown Brides , which was substantially researched through the Old Library Ferrar collecti on of papers. On the anniversary of Pepys's birthday, 23 February, the Pepys Librarian gave a prese ntation on seventeenth -century birthdays (royal and personal) with 'pyrotechnical' images from Pepys's collections of prints and excerpts from the Diary. The most significant achievement of the year in the Old Library was the completion of the Old Library book cleaning and condition checking project carried out by Heritage Volunteers from the 'Arts Society'. The entire collection of pre -19th century materia l in the Old Library has now been dusted and assessed for any professional conservation work needed. Some early discoveries of book damage in the project have already been repaired by the Cambridge College's Conservation Consortium, with generous financia l support from alumni via the 'back a book' fundraising initiative. In our popular monthly exhibition series, topics included Mary Astell's books, Modern First Editions, George Mallory, Incunabula and Italy. An augmented exhibition entitled 'Eating, Drink ing and Smoking' was curated alongside an impressive display of the College silver in the parlour to mark the 500th anniversary of the Hall . A selection of photograp hs from the A rchives were lent to the 'Rising Tide: Women at Cambridge' exhibition at Camb ridge University Library. The Summer Intern, Mhairi Rutherford, completed a project to create an online 'collaborative handlist' of the Ferrar Papers Collection, which enables scholars working on these eclectic documents to add their own bibliographical no tes and references. In January, the Ferrar Papers 66 which had been loaned to the Jamestown Museum, Virginia, arrived back to College safely and will form a future exhibition in the Old Library. In the Michaelmas Term, library staff worked on a joint Pepys Library -Old Library project concerning the incunabula (early printed books). Provenance and binding information for each volume was identified and added to the 'Material Evidence in Incunabula' online database, and information derived from this research wa s put to good use in the Old Library early printed books exhibition and in a series of special blog posts. Old Library F.4.16, ' Fasciculus' by Werner Rolewinck, printed in Leuwen by Johann Veldener, 1475, with an inscription in the hand of Simon Gun ton 67 The College Archive has entered a particularly busy period prior to its move into the new building. The decision was made to join the University -Library led archive management system, 'ArchivesSpace', which will in due course enab le the A rchives catalogue to move online, further promoting access to the collections. New acquisitions include various photographs and menu cards, and most notably the papers of Mr Michael Keall. A very fine facsimile of the 1215 Magna Carta was donated to the College by former Visiting Fellow Professor Myles Lynk to honour the Master on his retirement; a welcome gift as Magdalene houses an early Statute book including Magna Carta and its sister Charter of the Forest, from the reign of Edward I. The Old Library received a very generous donation of books from former Pepys Librarian Dr Richard Luckett, relating to our seventeenth -century alumnus, Sir Edward Dering, the English politician and antiquary. A number of gifts relating to the history of the Coll ege from Mr Mark Shelton have enhanced the Archive collection. Heritage Volunteers from the 'Arts Society' have been cleaning the buttery and account books, repackaging and condition checking photographs and collections of papers in preparation for the mo ve into the Ronald Hyam Archive Room in the new building. Some items identified have consequently been professionally conserved. A project carried out by volunteer Mrs Rachel Perry Eichhorst entailed listing, indexing and rehousing World War II records of service. Archives staff coordinated the logistical aspects of an external project to catalogue the Magdalene College Cripps Butterfly Collection, comprising of over 7000 specimens. Dr Matthew Hayes of the University Museum of Zoology has compiled a colle ction overview and species list of the collection which belonged to Sir Cyril Humphrey Cripps, now housed in Cripps Court. The project was funded by the Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn Collections Fund run by the Museums Association. It has been a year of two halves: unt il March, when the College 'locked down' there was a very healthy scholarly life in the libraries, with 22 readers working in the Old Library and 83 in the Pepys. 3455 members of the public came in during our regular opening times and we welcomed 18 tour s with 382 visitors. There were 10 special openings for College events, with 124 visitors. The 11 exhibitions in the Old Library attracted 550 visitors. 68 The College Library Our project to reorganise and reclassify the College Library collection took a leap forward this summer. The recruitment of a temporary Library Assistant and a student helper through July and August 2019 enabled us to reclassify and relabel several sectio ns: Modern Languages, Anglo Saxon Norse and Celtic, Economics, Social Anthropology, Land Economy, Economic History and (partially) Theology. The aim of this project is to make it easier to browse and find books, bringing works on similar subjects together into smaller and more relevant and identifiable sections. This was a complicated project to plan and get right in a relatively short space of time. To complete this work, the Deputy Librarian and Libraries Assistant updated the classification scheme, bre aking up existing subjects, creating sub -sections as well as creating whole new sections from scratch. Every book in these sections was then mapped to the new or updated sections on a spreadsheet and given a new class mark. The spreadsheets were passed o nto the Digital Services team at the UL who ran a programme to update the class marks in the catalogue. Having checked the update process and corrected errors , every book in these sections was then removed from the shelf (in order), re -labelled and then re -shelved (in the new order). Those of you who know the current Library well will understand that there is little room to manoeuvre, so this was a tricky proposition. We are pleased to say that, despite a few setbacks and with some creative reshuffling, w e successfully completed the work on time. As well as the reclassification project and the usual stock check we also moved the History, Classics, Archaeology, History of Art and Music as well as changing Law books from Overnight Loan to Short Loan. It was a busy, physically tiring but extremely rewarding summer and most importantly we have received very positive feedback from some of our students about the improved sections. The summer also saw the unexpected opportunity of adding two display cases, on l oan from St Catharine's College, to the College Library. These were placed in Middle Room, Left Cloister. This was a wonderful opportunity to showcase to our Library user s, material from the College's Archives, Old Library and College Library special col lections. In Michaelmas Dr Matilda Watson (College Archivist) put on a display of archive material relating to general College life and Ms Ellie Swire 69 (Libraries Assistant) put out a display o f the Dicken s's Christmas C arol first editions that we hold in the College Library. In Lent Susannah Roberts (Accommodation Officer) put on two displays of archival material, one on Magdalene's early May Balls and the second on Magdalene's B oat Club. The Magdalene Boat Club display Planning for moving the College Library into the New Library building has accelerated this academic year and the Library team have all continued to be extensively involved in the New Library project. The work on this project has been wide ranging, from putting possibl e Library chairs on trial in the Library to mapping out where each section will move to in the New Library. The College Library's collection has also been enriched by a number of donations from alumni and friends of the College this year. In recent month s we have been running a virtual library service from our homes, having been required to shut down the physical Library in response to the Coronavirus outbreak. Our focus has turned to trying to ensure the College community is aware of how to find and acc ess online resources, many of which have been newly made available as a response to the crisis. We have continued to remain available to answer enquiries virtually and to help our users access resources remotely. M E J H , M J W , Catherine Sutherland , and Tom Sykes 70 VI CHAPEL AND CHOIR Sacristans : B Davidson and W Gullock. Ordinand: H Richardson (Westcott). Lay Minister in training: M van der Tol (ERMC). 'On the Eighth Day' was drawn by Chapel warden, Rebecca Grubb, for the Lent Term Card, inspired by the Chapel windows. 2020's challenges brought separation and fragmentation but this vision of gathering and recreation reflects something of the togetherness and hope that the Chapel has tried to share through the pandemic. It is t he sad truth, though, that our togetherness has been tested over the past 12 months with the passing of thr ee much -loved friends, Mr Keall , Dr Lewins, and Bishop Simon. Their company and conversation are sorely missed. It was as we celebrated the eve of the first 'eighth day', on Easter Eve, that Bishop Simon died. Prayers were said that night in the Chapel he loved, and on the day of his private funeral. His witness has touched the College profoundly. We have cause to say, as he so often ended his sermons, 'thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift.' 71 This year's report must acknowledge the support of the wardens and placement students. In this peculiar year their flair meant the Chapel still flourished as a place of welcome, faith and community. S tudents are now represented on the Chapel Affairs Committee. In addition to regular services, events and Bible studies, we held an interdenominational 24 hours of prayer in November, a Confirmation service at the end of Michaelmas with the Master as bisho p, and a workshop on homelessness in Cambridge in March. Sadly, the Easter Term Baptism service and Reading Party to Southwold had to be cancelled. In Michaelmas, Evensong sermons considered creation: we heard the Master, the College's great friend Dr Cha rles Moseley and Dr Simone Kotva from the Divinity Faculty. Canon Michael Snape, Archbishop Ramsey Professor at Durham, preached for the College Act of Remembrance. Dr David Hoyle, our former Dean of Chapel, preached shortly after being installed as Dean of Westminster. The Advent and Christmas services (the latter at St Giles's) were hugely successful. For a Candlem as procession the Master read T S Eliot's 'Song for Simeon '. At the Meditation on the Cross, the passion of Professor Duffy's reading of 'The Dream of the Rood' was matched by the poignancy of the Choir's 'Steal Away'. St David's D ay fell on a Sunday and, in the Master's final year, we kept it with hymns and readings in Welsh and a sermon from Canon Dr Megan Daffern, former Chaplain of Jesu s Oxford. Other services in Lent focused on St Paul and we welcomed forme r chaplains Philip Hobday (2009 ) and Nick Widdows (2015) , and Canon Jenn Strawbridge, Associate Professor in NT at Mansfield, Oxford. When pandemic restrictions closed the Chapel at the end of March , services moved online. At a live -streamed Easter Dawn service from the Fellows' Garden the light over the river echoed the Master's reading of Charles Causley's 'Eden Rock', fresh and perfect that day after Bishop Simon's death. The woo dpeckers joined in for 'Thine be the glory'. Sunday mornings continued on Zoom from the Chaplain's house. Evening Prayer was streamed from the Chapel on Thursdays. Sunday Evensongs were br oadcast online with music from C hoir archives and recorded sermon s. Preachers invited by the Master for his final term included the Rt Revd Rose Hudson -Wilkin, Bishop of Dover on Martin Luther King Jr, and Canon Judith Maltby on Rose Macaulay. Virtual Benson Hall drinks proved a highlight of the week. The Commemorati on of Benefactors Evensong took place online before a virtual loving cup. 72 The online Graduation service was celebrated on the Feast of St Mary Magdalene to bid farewell to this year's remarkable graduands. Of course, there was one other au revoir from Ch apel this year, that for two of the best friends Chapel has had in recent years, Rowan and Jane. Their inspiration and support to the Chapel (and Chaplains!) and to College's communal and spiritual life, has been hugely significant. On the last Sunday of Term, Trinity Sunday, we held a special online Evensong, including a virtual recording of 'Guide me O thou great Redeemer', a reading from Lady Williams, Bach from Mr Jonathan Hellyer Jones and an improvisation on Psalm 42 from Mari\u00ebtta van der Tol. Then the Master preached live online on this 'feast of being out of your depth', the joyful exploration of intellectual and communal life. An evening of tributes followed and Professor Duffy proposed the toast. A surprise knock on the door of the Lodge broug ht them a gift, a book of memories and thanks. The Chapel reopened for prayer in early July. Collections this year went to the Whitworth Trust, the Children's Society, Cambridge Street Aid and Christian Aid. CHOIR REPORT . Organ Scholars : A Coutts and I MacDonald . Under the care and guidance of the Director of Music the Choir have shown dedication and skill in their weekly duties and at high -profile events. The sense of community in the Choir certainly brought success in the music and they exhibited gre at potential by the end of Lent Term in a memorable Passiontide service. The Junior Organ scholar was joined by the Senior Organ Scholar returning from his MML Year Abroad and new choral scholars swelled the ranks. One seasoned choral scholar, now a loca l secondary teacher at Chesterton Community College, brought her choir to sing Evensong in March, a welcome collaboration and a great chance to share the choral tradition. (They particularly appreciated the Master's welcome to the Lodge afterwards.) In N ovember the collaboration was with Peterhouse Choir whom we hosted with their Assistant Chaplain. Other events included entertaining distinguished alumni and guests at the Campaign Half -way event and Pepys celebrations. Three visits beyond Cambridge gave the Choir opportunity to sing in more resonant acoustics and to showcase their music to the wider world. In Michaelmas they sang for the Eucharist for All Souls at 73 Peterborough Cathedral, and the College was treated to their tender and glowing rendition o f the Faur \u00e9 Requiem for our own All Souls. Their hugely appreciated trip to London for the Alumni Carol Concert at All Saints Margaret Street included Beattie's setting of the Master's poem 'Advent Calendar' and Harvey's setting of Edwin Muir's 'Annunciat ion', both of which they mastered intelligently, with their increasing command of tuning and a luminous tone. Before Lent T erm began they undertook a successful student -led Epiphany residency in the splendour of Durham Cathedral. The Choir were sorely mis sed in Easter Term. The silence began with the sad cancellation of the April tour to Krakow whi ch had been meticulously organis ed by a native alto. The Prece ntor was furloughed for Easter T erm. However, in recognition of the College's affection for the Choir, and our need for their music in these strange times, archive recordings were used for online Evensongs and virtual recordings were made for the Master's last service and for the Mary Magdale ne graduation service. Online singing lessons kept some of the momentum going but, needless to say, Choir members look forward to a time when they can meet together. The feeling is mutual: the Chapel misses them for the transcendence they bring to worshi p, and the whole College misses their music. Live music, particularly choral singing, is one of the most precious gifts the College offers. The pleasure of sharing in a transient moment of beauty is missed perhaps now more than ever. How things will loo k as the pandemic times continue is unclear. But the College believes in the value of a cultural and musical life together as the one of the best enviro nments for academic exploration. W hen the songs do return , there will be much rejoicing. S A VII GARDENS The sunniest April on record, preceded by one of the wettest winters for several years, was a great boon to the display of wallflowers and remaining tulips in First Court. I say 'remaining tulips ', because what could only be described as a gang of tenacious rats came close to decimating the 1 ,500 Tulipa 'Apeldoorn' we planted in October. Richard, our superb pest -control man, set up a motion camera and we eventually 74 found and despatched them along with over 400 tulips they had cached in the corner of First Court by F staircase! As the New L ibrary grows in the space of the old fruit trees in the Fellows' G arden, we planted a new orchard in Buckingham Court to replace those planted by Professor Grubb in the 1980s. A mixture of apples, pears , and gages obtained from the East of England Orchard Project was planted in November in the wild area esta blished behind the Development O ffice. Heritage varieties were selected to give a flavour of yesteryear and to hel p preserve some long forgotten varieties raised in the area. Almost all the cultivars planted originated in Cambridgeshire, such as the apples Lord Peckover (Wisbech) and Murfitt's Seedling (Histon) and the Willingham. We had to cross county lines into Bedfordshire to obtain the pear: Laxton's Superb and Laxton's Satisfaction. There was also a foray into Essex to obtain the apple Green Harvey, although there is a strong Cambridge link albeit a Trinity one! With luck , in a few years the orchard will begin to be productive and we may be able to supply some fruit to the kitchen. Planting the new orchard in Buckingham Court (Photo: Matt Moon ) 75 In Lent T erm, the team go t to grips with the front garden of the Master's Lodge. After much clearance work and groun d preparation a new lawn, under -planted with several thousand crocuses was established. This complements the border planted last year with Epimedium and winter interest shrubs around the perimeter wall. All being well, the entrance to the Lodge, sho uld have a more cohesive and aesthetic look to it as time passes and the scheme matures. The bedding scheme in First Court this summer has a yellow and blue theme. The main body of the planting is yellow gazania accented with ornamental ginger ( Hedychium ) and Canna indica. A new salvia called 'Black and Bloom'is also dotted in among the gazanias. Edging the borders is Isotoma axillaris 'Blue Gem' wit h its dainty profusions of star - shaped blue flowers. The large C hapel bed has been left fallow this summe r du e to the necessary work to the C hapel roof , but sh ould be restocked in the autumn when it will be replanted with wallflowers and tulips. Looking forward to the autumn, the team hope s to renovate the southern border adjacent to Hall and Buttery with a South African themed planting replacing the shrubs which a re beginning to get quite large. The other task the team is relishing is the planting of the New Library and its environs once the building work is complete. Mark Scott The river from the Scholars' Garden in September 2019 76 VIII COLLEGE STAFF In December 2019 the College was saddened to hear of the death of a former member, Jill Kirkup, at the age of 78. Jill worked in the College Office for many years, was always fri endly and helpful : short of stature but large of spirit. It was not only the pandemic that made 2020 momentous for staff. Sarah Palmer, personal assistant to the Senior Bursar, retired after more than 34 years' service. Sadly, lockdown curtailed her fina l goodbyes but there will be a future opportunity to say farewells properly. Anne Fulton has succeeded her. A happy leaving lunch was however held for Jo Green, and we welcomed Hazel Breaker in her place as Senior Payroll Administrator. After 12 years' service, Vicky Levet took u p the challenge of Admissions at Gonville and Caius College while Sandy Mill, Schools Liaison Officer for more than four years, moved to a new post at Sidney Sussex College . Sandy achieved great success in his outreach work in our link area of Merseyside and North Wales and in the Seren Network. At the end of the last academic al year, Angie Jewell joined the Academic Office, and after some delay, Lucy Hartley joined us as D eputy Academic Registrar and Undergraduate Admissions Officer. The Development Office welcomed Alex Day, an expert on databases, and welcomed back Sarah Reynolds and Emma Tunbridge - Hibbert from their maternity leaves which had been admirably covered by H annah Courtney. The Maintenance D epartment was joined by Glynn Delmar as multi -skills operative, Billy Betts as carpentry apprentice and Barry Graves as electrician, each contributing to the upkeep and improvement of College buildings. The wonderful team of gardeners lost Andy Clarke to a new post but gained Wayne Dickerson. Together, the team makes the College a most beautiful place in which to work and a haven for a variety of wildlife. Three P orters also left t he C ollege: Pepa Forsyth, Ed Davi s and Rupert Wilkey; and Rupert was congratulated on winning the coveted CUSU Student -led Teaching Aw ard 2020 for Inclusive Practice; it has been a privilege to have him on the staff for the last three years . A Fellow of the Zoological Society and of the Royal Geographical Society, Rupert has a world -wide reputation as a herpetologist with an important series of handbooks published on the snakes of various countries, especially in 77 Africa (his Snakes of Malawi is now i n its 6th edition); mountaineering is among his many other interests. Vicky Wallace, after nine excellent years in the Conference Department, has moved to Christ's College, while Housekeeping welcomed Vanya Nastanlieva -Igleva and Victoria Tokareva. Sybil Crisford resigned from the department and all wish her a very happy retirement. Finally, after more than 18 years' service in the Computer Department, Mark Reed took early retirement. Mark unassumi ngly helped almost everyone in C ollege at one time or other with his expertise and put up with IT questions however trivial. He leaves with all good wishes for the future. H F Magdalene Street in June 20 20 (Photo: Matt Moon ) 78 IX EVENTS AND COMMEMORA TIONS HALL AT 500 . The Hall celebrated its 500th anniversary this year. Built in 1519, the Hall has been the centre of life in the College for generations of students, Fellows, and, of course, staff. So, a special event for staff and retired staff was arranged on 9 November 2019. The day included an exhibition in the Old Library on 'Eating, Drinking, and Smoking' at Magdalene, curated by the Archivist Emeritus, Dr Hyam, and the College Archivist, Dr Matilda Watson. In the Parlour, there was a scintillating exhibition of the College Silver, by permission of the Senior Bursar. Refreshments in Hall were provided by the Executive Chef, Gary Wren, and his team. The tables were spread with colourful and i maginative food all with a Tudor theme, including mead, marzipan apples, gingerbread, Hippocras -soaked figs, lavender scones and dried fruit & marmalade bread. PEPYS DINNER . The annual Pepys Dinner took place in Hall on 21 February. The theme of the d inner and the post -prandial entertainment was 'Birthdays: royal and private', with actor Leighton Pugh narrating a script from the Diary, prepared by the Pepys Librarian, revealing how Pepys celebrated his own natal day and those of his court masters. Festive music was organised by the Director of Music, Graham Walker. The Choir sang the Pepys Club Grace before dinner and a grace by William Byrd after. During the Easter Term, the Alumni and Development Office organised a series of virtual events (available to view on www.magd,cam,ac,uk/alumni/events ) which were open to Magdalene Members and friends: (1) DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF COVID -19 RESEARCH IN CAMBRIDGE . On 28 May , Dr Caddy joine d the Master for a conversation on ongoing coronavirus research in Cambridge. Following on from the conversation, attendees had the opportunity to pose their own questions to Dr Caddy. 115 Members and friends tuned into the event. (2) SEAMUS HEANEY : A CONVERSATION . On 19 June the Master hosted a panel discussion and Q & A session on Honorary Fellow and Nobel Prize laureate Irish poet Seamus Heaney. Dr Williams was joined by Professor 79 Duffy and Mr Fintan O'Toole, acc laimed Irish journalist and 2019 Magdalene Parnell Fellow. The discussion built on the annual Parnell lecture by Mr O'Toole, 'Escaped from the Massacre? Heaney and History', also available on the College website. 129 Members and friends watched the event live. (3) BUCKINGHAM SOCIETY EVENT . On 25 June, the Buckingham Society Members were invited to join the Master for a virtual event with Dr Gregory who presented his current research on using acoustics to aid the diagnosis of dysphagia (see p 101), after which attendees had the opportu nity to pose their own questions on the subject. The event ended with a toast to the College by Professor Duffy. Over 40 Members joined us for this event. (4) CHANGING THE LANDSCAPE : A JUST AND SECURE FUTURE FOR BAME STUDENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION . On 9 July, the Master, was joined by Dr Meghji and Professor Aigbirhio for a virtual panel discussion. Panellists shared relevant research and reflection in light of the recent events surrounding George Floyd's tragic death and the Black Lives Matter movement . After the discussion, panellists answered questions from the audience. 105 Members and friends joined us for the event. (5) VIRTUAL GRADUATION CELEBRATION : MARY MAGDALENE DAY. As students were unable to graduate in person at the Senate House this ye ar due to the coronavirus pandemic, a virtual celebration was organised on 22 July, Mary Magdalene Day, f or the graduating cohort to come together the commemorate their successes and reminisce with friends . Students and their guests were invited to join t he Master, Fellows , and Director of Studies for a series of virtual events. The evening started with a special Graduation Evensong celebrated by the Chaplain. Graduands and their guests were then invited to join a session hosted by the Master, with speec hes from the Praelector, the Tutors, the Chaplain , and ex -JCR President, Mia Lupoli. The evening ended with a virtual 'garde n party' during which Graduands had the opportunity to talk within their subject groups. It is hoped that students will be able to return to Cambridge sometime next year to enjoy the usual graduation festivities in person. 80 X ALUMNI AND DEVELOPMENT 1 REUNIONS A Reunion Dinner for 20 04-06 matriculands was held on Friday 20 September 2019, attended by 37 alumni, five Fellows, an d two members of staff. The after dinner speaker was Dr Susannah Cass (2006 ). A Reunion Dinner for 2007 -09 matriculands was held on Friday 27 September 2019, attended by 33 alumni, four Fellows, and two members of staff. The after dinner speaker was Mr Ali Jaffer (2007). It was with regret that bot h the Reunion Dinner for 1960 -63 matriculands on Friday 3 April, and the Reunion Lunch for up to 1957 matriculands on Saturday 2 May, were cancelled owing to the coronavirus pandemic. We hope to reschedule t hese events at a future date. 2 AWARDS AND ACHIEVEME NTS J N R Amey (1968): Hon Fellow of the Institute of Healthcare Engineering and Estate Management The Hon D M Barnes (1996): the first woman Chief Judge of the Mississippi State Court of Appeals; 2019 Susie Blue Award S R M Baynes (1979): MP for Clwyd South Dr A Binder (2014): 2020 K\u00f6der Foundation German Dissertation Award Prof R D Blandford (1967): 2020 Shaw Prize in Astronomy S A Collins (1969): Trustee of The Cystic Fibrosis Trust Dr N D Hall (1967): Honorary Degree from the University of Bath Dr P Magalh \u00e3es de Oliveira (2015) : Clean S ky Academy Award for the best PhD Thesis in Applied Sciences and Engineering for Aeronautics J W D Marshall (1998): CBE for political and public services Revd Prof J L Morgan (Visiting Fellow 2000 ): AM for significant services to education, and to the Anglican Church of Australia Dr S P D G O'Harrow (1991): Executive Director of the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City, Missouri, USA E Olcott (2014): Schwarzman Scholar (2021) T Orchard Hall S D Ramsden (1990): MBE for services to International Trade S R Saxby (1989): MP for South Devon 81 3 SELECTED PUBLICATIONS L Arbuthnot (2010), Looking for Eliza (2020) Dr A K Buell (Research Fellow 2011 -14), Biological and Bio -inspired Nanomaterials: Properties and Assembly Mechanisms (2019) *N Billingsley (2007): The Visionary Art of William Blake : Christian ity Romanticism & the Pictorial Imagination (2018) F C Dunlop (1988): The Food of Sichuan (2019) M J Estorick (1970): About Time (2019) K E J Fletcher (1994): Wild Dress: Clothing & the Natural W orld (2019) *W Fraser (dir) (1995): The English Organ (4-DVD/3 -CD Set, 2019) R Gilmore (2013): The Delhi Dispatch (2013) *S Haskell (1951): An Introduction to Christian Spirituality (2020) *I Kareklas (1958): Thucydides on International Law and Political Theory (2020) *C S Knighton (1958) (ed): Bristol University: Conception to F oundation (2019) R F Kuang (2018): The Dragon Republic (2019) *T Lee (1978) (co -author): The Rise of Carry: The Dangerous C onsequences of VolatilitySsuppression and the New F inanc ial O rder (2020) with J Lee and K Coldir on *C Lintott (1999): The Crowd and Zooniverse (2019) *A Lownie (1981): The Mountbattens : Their Lives and Loves (2019) Dr M C J Malins (2006): The Puritan Princess (2020) I A Milligan (1969): Sovereign of the Isles: How th e British Isles Were Won by the Crown (2002) J Mole (1961): Gold to Gold (2020), reviewed below p 121 M T O'Hara (1988): The Shame Game: Overturning the Toxic Poverty Narrative (2020) The Revd C E Sugden (1978): A Cello Teacher's Companion Edzell: Ken Your N eighbour (2019) *We are grateful to these authors for presenting copies of their works to the College Library. 4 MEMBERS' DEATHS (reported to mid -July 2020) V G B Mansell (1936); W E C Carrigan (1941); Rear -Admiral Burgoyne, CB (1944); Dr M G Rinsler (1944); M Phillips (1946); 82 S L Maguire (1947); Dr G W Miller (1948); D W G Sawyer (1948); C Steane (1948); J K Buckenham (1949); (1949); G W F Meath -Baker (1949); His Honour R E I Pickering (1949); M H Vignoles (1949); T he Revd S (1949); (1950); M Sandys (1951); Dr M Taggart (1952); The Pilkington J C (1953); M McCarraher (1953); Major D F Morgan (1953); Sir A J (1953); C J M H H W Cross O H G A Lyon (1957); M Merifield (1957); C A J Bartlett (1958); R S Hill (1959); R D F Forster (1960); M G Holmes, OBE (1960); J M Kolbert (1960); P J Maydon (1960); D J Polgreen (1960); J H Davidson (1961 ); Hon J A Shaw (1962); The Revd R W Bowen (1966); The Revd Dr D H Milling (1969); W Yip (1969); S A A Seligmann (1970); C S (1981); A J McLachlan (1987); Tim Robinson (26 M arch 1935 - 3 April 2020) , Parnell Fellow 2011 Born in St Albans, Hertfordshire, Tim Robinson grew up in Ilkley, Yorkshire. As a child he explored 'the watery intricacies' and 'airy uplands' of Wharfedale and Ilkley Moor with his brother, landscapes that were later echoed in the Burren area of County Clare and in Roundstone Bog. After serving his national service in the RAF in Malaya, he studied 83 mathematics and physics at Sidney Sussex, and in 1959 married Margaret Fitzgibbon, kn own as M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad (M in his books). She was his constant partner, supporter, and fellow -traveller on his many expeditions, starting with a long sojourn in Istanbul. In Vienna, he painted and exhibited, and after returning to London in 1964, he worked also a s a subeditor and technical illustrator. His geometric paintings from this period are now in the collection of the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin. The Irish dimension to Tim's life, and what so happily brought him to Magdalene as Parnell Fellow in 2 011, began with a visit in 1972 to the Aran Islands. The islands, associated by most of us with J M Synge, were to consume his imagination ever after. Setting Foot on the Shores of Connemara was published in 1984. The harshly beautiful sea and landscape opened out from the Robinsons' home in Roundstone, County Galway. The house overlooked the pier and the landward bay towards the Twelve Bens of Connemara, and housed an ever -growing mass of his notes and maps. For decades, this house was a welcoming magnet for artists, walkers, scientists, and fellow explorers of the landscape and its habitations. Tim's successive books were published by Folding Landscapes, the imprint he set up with his wife, and all were accompanied by his intricate hand -drawn maps. In the two volumes of Stones of Aran , he recorded h is walks around \u00c1rainn, the largest of the Aran Islands. The first book, Pilgrimage (1986), followed in piercing prose and meticulous detail the dramatic coa stline of the islands and won the Irish Book Awards literature medal. Nine years later, Labyrinth (1995), pursued the names, stories and places of \u00c1rainn's interior, searching for marine and geological origins of the Irish language. Between 2006 and 2011 he published his Connemara trilogy, Listening to the Wind , The Last Pool of Darkness and A Little Gaelic Kingdom , all masterful explorations of the relationship between the human and the inanimate, and the recipients of two more Iris h Book awards. Robinson was elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 2010. A year later, in Magdalene, the audience for an astonishing paper he gave to the Irish Studies Seminar, marvelled at his maps of the Aran Islands, the Burren and Connemara. These, for him, were the 'ABC of earth wonders', the maps he made of them, unique assemblages of topography, language, geology, myth and physics. His splendid yet cautionary Parnell Lecture, 'A Land Without Shortcuts' used this determinedly and 84 exacting local focus to pose far -reaching questions about the damage caused by centuries of conflict over land and language. In his last book, Experiments on Reality (2019), he wrote that the 'course of evolution that brought us forth from cosmic dust is a sequence of marvels the contemplation of which has dazzled and delighted me my whole life'. Between 2006 and 2014 he donated much of his archive material, including p hotographs, manuscripts, place -name records , and correspondence with other writers, to the James Hardiman Library at the National University of Ire land Galway. Tim died after contracting Covid -19; M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad died two weeks before him. J R R Professor Maurice Wildon Montague Pope (17 February 1926 - 1 August 2019) one of the leading researchers of the Cretan script Linear A, was born in London and educated at Sherborne School. Taking advantage of a special scheme in which he signed up for military service before he reached the age for enrolment, he was able to study at Cambridge University for six months as a naval cadet before joining up. In the navy he rose to the rank of third officer on a landing craft, and left the navy at the end of 1946. resuming his study of the classics as a regular undergraduate at Magdalene. In 1949 he became a teaching ass istant in classical studies at t he University of Cape Town , lecturer from 1952, professor from 1957, and then Dean of the Faculty of Humanities. As a ling uist specialising in Classical S tudies and A ntiquity, he participated in many pioneering arch aeological expeditions. In 1968, however, he resigned from his position at Cape Town in protest again st apartheid policies and moved to teach and research at Oxford Uni versity , where in the 1980s, in cooperation with Jacques Raison, he prepared and published a corpus of Minoan Linear A inscriptions . Common to his two main specialisms , Linear A and Homer, was his meticulous statistical calculation of symbol or word combinations. The same analytical approach was also applied, with similar clear and compelling results, to questions of the interpretation of 85 literary texts. His interest in decipherment inspired him to publish in 1975 The Story of Archaeological Decipherment: From Egyptian Hieroglyphs to Linear B, but the book by which he is most widely known, updated in 1999, is The Story of Decipherment: From Egyptian Hieroglyphs to Maya Script . A devoted family man, his great sense of humour was epitomised by the title he gave his autobiography, Amateur . Professor Sir Malcolm Keith Sykes (13 September 1925 - 17 November 2019) was born in Clevedon , Somerset , the only son of economist Joseph Sykes OBE and Phyllis Mary Greenwood. After schools in Plymouth, Exeter, Leatherhead, and Halifax, he came up to Magdalene in 1944 to study medicine before training in anaesthetics whil e serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps , and then at University College Medical School 1946 -9. In 1954-5 he was a Fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital with a Rickmann Godlee Travelling Scholarship, visiting 41 North American hospitals. He was appointed consultant at Hammersmith Hospital, London in 1958 , with lecturer status in the Royal Postgraduate Medical School , and advanced successively to Senior Lecturer (1963) and R eader (1967) becoming Professor of Clinical Anaesthesia in 1970. At the Hammersmith he studied the management of tetanus, spen ding 6 months in Durban, South Africa, where his work reduced mortality from 80 to 21%. The experience stimulated his interest in ventilators, but back at the Hammersmith his activities focussed on anaesthesia for open -heart surgery (introducing artificia l ventilation in postoperative care, and using then new methods of blood gas analysis in research), studying respiratory physiology and setting up Britain's first in -hospital resuscitation programme. He was elected Nuffield Professor of Anaesthetics at Ox ford in 1980 and Fellow of Pembroke College , Oxford. At Oxford, he established a cardiorespiratory laboratory for studies of pulmonary circulation and the effect of cardiovascular drugs on pulmonary shunting. He is the author of notable books about the clinical measurement and treatment of respiratory failure, and the history of anaesthesia. In 1991 he was knighted and elected Honorary Fellow of Pembroke , Oxford, Among numerous awards and fellowships, he was Fellow of the Royal College 86 of Anaesthetists , an Honorary Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthestists , and an Honorary Fellow of the College of Anaesthetists of South Africa . He married the art historian, Michelle June Ratc liffe (who predeceased him) in 1956. Richard Hastie -Smith (13 October 1931 - 30 March 2020). A former and long -serving Chairman of the Magdalene College Association (1983 -94) and great supporter of his old friend, the then Master, Sir David Calcutt, Richard Hastie -Smith came from a family of Scottish engineers who spent more than 110 years working in Moscow and of Irish bacon producers who made a fortune during the First World War. He was educated at Cranleigh School and arrived at Magdalene in the autumn of 1951, on leave from the Army (Queen's Royal Regiment) . In his Memoirs he recalls, 'the next 3 years were among the happiest I have ever known, and I look back on them through a golden glow. There was a wonderful feeling of \"freedom regained\" in going to Cambridge after the regimental rigour of National ser vice.... Hard academic work was not fashionable but it was the Master's proud boast that probably a higher proportion of former members of the College achieved the dubious distinction of an entry in Who's Who than any other College.... As I kept the same set o f rooms in First Court for all three years at Cambridge, I never lacked for visitors.' His distinguished career in the Civil Service began at the Home Office in 1955, but he moved swiftly to the W ar Office, rising to be Assistant Private Secretary to the Secretary of State in 1958 and Principal in1960. In 1965 he became Assistant Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Defence, and following other promotions was appointed Under - Secretary at the MoD in 1975 , to the Cabinet Office in 1979, and final ly Deputy Under -Secretary of State at the MoD, 1981-91. In these various offices he worked closely with or was otherwise involved with Christopher Soames, then Secretary of State for War, Clive Ponting, Sarah Tisdall, the Falklands War and the Iranian Emba ssy siege. He worked closely with Margaret Thatcher, Denis Heal ey, and John Nott. 87 As Chairman of the Magdalene Association he ran, in his words, 'an informal network to help members of the College get jobs' but it was much more than that: his energy and hospitality ensured importan t financial assistance for the C ollege as well as crucial support for th e admission of women in 1988. Hastie -Smith had a vast array of interests that included a love of music, opera, ballet, art, theatre, dogs and walking, as we ll as serving for decades as Chair of the governing body of his old school, of Bramley School, and of the Froebel Institute. He died in his Richmond Gr een home of 88 years. He is survived by Bridget, his wife of 63 years, his three children and six grand children. Guy David Innes -Ker, 10th Duke of Roxburghe (18 November 1954 - 29 August 2019) won a place at Magdalene from Eton where he had captained the First XI cricket but also excelled throughout his life at tennis, squash, golf, riding, shooting and fishing. On his father's advice, he deferred his place to read Land Economy in order to take a three -year commission in the Blues and Royals. After Sandhurst, where he graduated with the Sword of Honour, he served in Cyprus in the aftermath of the July 197 4 Turkish invasion. Months later, on his father's sudden death, he inherited the title and a 60,000 -acre estate . After active service in Northern Ireland, he arrived at Magdalene in 1977 where his studies contributed to his success in putting his vast estate on a stable financial footing, renovating his eighteenth - century Floors Castle and opening it to the public, while retaining it as a family home. The gardens were expanded and visitor numbers soared after the Castle featured in the 1984 Hollywood film 'Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan'. Over the next 20 years he developed the Roxburghe Golf Course, a championship course with hotel complex, to be among the ten best in Scotland. But Guy Roxburghe's greatest passion was horse racing and with his Floors St ud he proved the most successful thoroughbred breeder in Scotland in modern times. One of his horses, 'Attraction,' was the first to win both the 1,000 Guineas and Irish 1,000 Guineas. He was a long -serving administrator with the Jockey Club, and became Chairman of the National Stud in 2017. Locally, he hosted point - to-points, common riding, the Buccleuch hunt, and the Floors Castle 88 International Horse Trials. He held directorships in the City of London and was a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of F ishmongers and a Freeman of the City of London. He developed a serious interest in renewable energy and was among the first historic house owners to install a biomass heating system. His wind farm, established in 2013, now supplies 90,000 homes, and thro ugh a fund established with its developer, more than \u00a31 million has been invested in local community projects. Latterly, he raised more than \u00a31.3 million with Sotheby's former chairman Henry Wyndham in support of the Orbis Flying Eye Hospital and a cancer research project at Brunel University. He is celebrated as a generous host over many years to a wide circle of friends. Development Director's Report The world changed as we celebrated the third anniversary of the College's Future Foundations Campaign in March this year. We had hit our target two years early thanks to receiving thousands of gifts from Members and Friends and we were busily planning the grand opening of the New Library in September 2020 as well as the next phase of the campaign. The c elebrations were and are more than justified as together we have built an amazing new library for Magdalene, a building which will enhance the College estate for centuries to come. We could not have achieved this remarkable feat without the wonderfully ge nerous help of the global Magdalene community. The New Library is on course to be completed by the end of November despite the delay caused by lockdown in Spring . If all goes well, Covid -19 permitting, it will open for students and staff in Lent T erm 202 1. We are planning to invite Members to visit the New Library virtually when it is open as it may be some time before it is possible for us all to drink a toast to the new building together. For now, we can only reiterate our most grateful thanks to all those who shared and supported the vision of realising a new College library for Magdalene. Please visit the website to view it: www.magd.cam.ac.uk/the -new -library. At the end of this singular academic al year which included the first Easter Term in living memory without students, May Week, Balls , and Bumps and, to be prosaic, the Telephone Campaign, we surpassed the \u00a326 million mark in funds raised for the Future Foundations Campaign . We have received 3, 909 gifts from almost 2,300 Members and Friends in the 89 last three years. Our first ever Giving Day on 11 March (who knew at the time it would be the last College event of the year) raised a fantastic \u00a3100,000 in 36 hours from 335 gifts of which more than 100 were made by first time donors. We launched an Emergency Fund during lockdown to raise funds to help our people, the students, researchers, supervisors, and academic staff suddenly facing unexpected and exceptional financial difficulties owing to Covi d-19. By the end of the financial year (30 June) the Emergency Fund had raised an astonishing \u00a3150,000. The Rowan and Jane Williams Bursary Fund stands at a wonderful \u00a3220,000 and will support at least one of our incoming undergraduates with a full R&J Williams bursary from Michaelmas 2020. All of this is the result of your unfailing support and generosity and we are once again humbled by the amazingly warm response of the wider Magdalene community. Our alumni relations programme was as busy as ever unti l March and the programme included Magdalene Dinners in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Hong Kong in late summer and, for the first time in many years, a dinner in Sydney. We are enormously grateful to our Honorary Fellow, the Sultan of Perak, Dr Nazrin Shah (20 15), James Woodrow (1985), Henry Pang (1986), and Rhiannon Chisholm (1994) respectively for their generous assistance in hosting events for the Magdalene Community in the Asia -Pacific region. Barbara Yu (1995) hosted yet another 'Open Day' for potential M agdalene applicants in Singapore, involving a talk from the Master and a presentation by the Senior Tutor and we are indebted to her and Yen How Tai for their unstinting support. Later in Michaelmas Term, we visited the United States and the 28th Annual Ne w York Dinner was followed by dinners in Seattle and San Francisco. Once again, we owe grateful thanks to Robert Chartener (1988), Marshal McReal (1991) and Alex Schultz (2000) for their help, their generosity and their unfailing enthusiasm for all things Magdalene. Many Members and Friends joined us for these occasions to bid farewell to the Master. In College, we celebrated the mid -way mark of the Future Foundations Campaign with a magnificent black tie Halfway Campaign Dinner in Hall which was packed to the rafters and we concluded the year with the annual College Choir Carol Concert in London happily attended by over 200 Members and guests. 90 In Lent Term, we welcomed more than 100 Members and students to the annual Medical Dinner in Hall, held (as it turned out) our final NRM Night of the year and enjoyed a Magdalene in London event at Mercers' Hall. We joined forces for this event with Murray Edwards College and dozens of students from both colleges enjoyed a panel discussion exploring life and work after graduation. We are grateful to Elise Larkin (2012) and James Heaven (2012) as well as Yasmin Dick and Eleanor Dalgleish from Murray Edwards for sharing their insights. We were delighted that the Master, and Dame Barbara Stocking, President of Murra y Edwards, were able to join the students and around 100 alumni from the two Colleges. We are indebted to Chris Vermont (1979) and his wife, Sarah Vermont (Murray Edwards) for assisting with the organisation and generously hosting this event. Dinners in Washington and Boston followed in February allowing the Master to wish a fond farewell to Members and we are once again very grateful to Frank Crantz (1969) and Alastair Adam (1990) for generously hosting dinners at the Cosmos Club and the Somerset Club respectively. We are humbled by the generous welcome we receive every year and so grateful that more than 25% of Members in the USA chose to support the College with a gift this year. We could not, of course, achieve this without the sterling work of the M agdalene College Foundation Directors, led by the inimitable Robert Chartener (1982), Fellow Commoner and Chairman, and thank Geoffrey Craddock (1977), Dr Jason Hafler (2006), The Hon David Brigstocke (1971), Graham Walker (1982) and Suzanna Jembsy (1990) for their continued service to the College. A unique event in Amsterdam in early March involving a dinner in the spectacular setting of the Ship Chandler's Hall and private tours of the Rijksmuseum the next morning proved to be the last gathering of the year. It was a high note on which to end, and only possible thanks to the generous assistance of Jonathan Lowe (1982) We have had to cancel all planned events for Easter Term including two Reunions, the annual Buckingham Society Luncheon, the Master's Cam paign Dinners, and sadly, the events planned to wish the Master and Lady Williams farewell and to thank them for eight wonderful years of service. I know many of you will agree that the success of the Future Foundations Campaign thus far is in no small me asure due to the 91wonderfully gracious, warm and enthusiastic leadership of our departing Master, Dr Rowan Williams. We are grateful to him, Lady Williams and all of our Members and Friends, who continue to welcome us with warmth, generosity and enthusiasm throughout the year. Thank you. C D L A complete list of Members who have supported the College with a donation during the past financial year (1 July 2019 - 30 June 2020) will be published in the next Annual Donors Report, which will be published in the autumn. River Cam in Ju ne 2020 (P hoto: Matt Moon ) 92 ADVENTURES IN ANCIEN T WRITING AND THE CYPRIOT TEAR DROP Four years ago , I had the good fortune to be awarded a Horizon 2020 grant to investigate an idea that had been praying on my mind for some time: how can we work out how the idea of writing developed and spread in the ancient world? Early writing systems themselves might be well known - cuneiform in Mesopotamia, hieroglyphs in Egypt, syllabic systems in the Mediterranean, logographic writing in China, Mayan glyphs in Central America - but each system tends to be the preserve of its own specialists, and it is relatively ra re for scholarship to transcend regional boundaries to try to gain a broader view. I became interested in the more dynamic aspect of how writing traditions are related to each other and how they change over time in response to linguistic and social stimuli . Although writing systems studies is by no means a new area of research, scholars have usually been more interested in the minute particulars of language notation than the context of writing as a practice. Writing system typology has been particularly po pular, especially since the influential field called 'grammatology' was coined by Ignace Gelb in the mid -twentieth century. But Gelb's approach to writing was based on a somewhat dubious 'evolutionary' framework that saw some forms of writing as primitive and others as advanced, with an inevitable historical progression from picture writing, via syllabaries, to the refined alphabets that reached their height in the cultures of the ancient Greeks and Romans. The implication that primitive writing systems b elong to primitive societies, while advanced writing is the preserve of high western civilisation, could hardly be more explicit. More recent studies have begun to redress these unhelpful biases, but in doing so they have tended to shy away from the big p icture and concentrate on safer descriptive approaches. A closer look at the writing traditions of the ancient world reveals that this big picture could in fact be very complex. Elements of writing traditions could be developed in one society and then ado pted by another and adapted for their own uses. Writing systems could transcend linguistic boundaries, which frequently meant there was a need to make changes to the set of signs and their phonetic values in order to record a 93 new language. Even the writi ng system type (such as the way in which language features are encoded) could be radically changed through such encounters. Individual societies often placed considerable importance on their own writing tradition and developed distinctive features that deliberately marked them out from their neighbours. There is nothing inevitable or evolutionary about these mechanisms of change: they were driven by people, by multilingual and multicultural encounters, and by the social and cultural settings in which writi ng was developed and used. My current research is driven by the observation that the dynamics of writing system development demand new and interdisciplinary approaches if we are to gain a more nuanced appreciation of the history (or rather histories) of wr iting. I reached this conclusion during an earlier project on language use in the eastern Mediterranean, focusing on the island of Cyprus, which caused a shift in my attention from language use to the writing traditions that produced the inscriptions. The re is something about Cyprus that makes it quite special: a sort of eastern outpost of the Greek -speaking world that is closer to the Near East, Anatolia and even Egypt than it is to much of Greece. Cyprus has its own dialect and traditions, and throughou t history its unique position has opened it up to distinctive relationships with the societies and powers to the east and west, and to the north and south. In the modern age, we know Cyprus for the saddest of reasons: the only country in the world that still has a divided capital, with a line drawn through the country's map like a scar marking out the continuing Turkish occupation of its northern half, invaded in 1974. Neither was the island a stranger to the highs and lows of international political wrang ling in the ancient period, and its combination of desirable location and sought -after resources - especially the copper with which it shares its name - made it a target for both diplomatic relationships and aggressive action over the millennia. What is really striking is that from the Late Bronze Age onwards - when we have the first evidence of a complex, stratified society with elites trying to control natural resources and enjoy the riches of their new positions - Cyprus became home to utterly distinctive traditions of writing. There were some borrowed ideas for sure, but the overwhelming impression one gets from the Late Bronze Age corpus of Cypriot inscriptions is one of creativity. Clay was one material used for writing, as it was in the Aeg ean to the west, Anatolia to the north and the Levant and Mesopotamia to the east. But the surviving clay documents are ones 94 that are not usually familiar in other areas, such as small spherical balls with one or two words inscribed on them, or small cyli nders with text curving round the outside. Even the handful of clay tablets surviving from Bronze Age Cyprus defy easy categorisation as Aegean or Mesopotamian types, and they vary greatly in their features and method of execution. Other inscribed items r ange from metal tools and jewellery to vases and ivory votive objects. We have examples of Cypriot inscribed and uninscribed cylinder seals, usually in soapstone or semi -precious stone, an object type used in the Near East to authenticate transactions by rolling the design in the wet clay of a vessel or tablet - but in Cyprus we have no evidence that they were used in the same way, perhaps indicating that the Cypriot examples were personal prestige items with limited functionality. Cypro -Minoan clay ball (Image courtesy of Silvia Ferrara ) All these objects are written in a script that Arthur Evans, the early twentieth -century archaeologist and famously the excavator of Knossos in Crete, labelled 'Cypro -Minoan'. The label itself hints at Cretan connections, and indeed it looks as though Cypro -Minoan writing represents an adoption of the Minoan Linear A system used in Bronze 95 Age Crete. Both writing systems remain undeciphered, but through other related systems (Linear B and the later Cypri ot syllabic script, both used for Greek) we can identify some shared signs with very probable shared phonetic values. Cypro -Minoan was not a straightforward borrowing of Linear A, however, and many of its signs are quite different in appearance, making it difficult to study palaeographically. With only about 250 surviving inscriptions, we currently have little hope of conclusively deciphering Cypro -Minoan, but we can tell much more about the place of writing in society by studying the documents written in it and their archaeological and material context. A collaboration last year with a member of my research team, Philip Boyes, brought a new appreciation of the clay tablets inscribed in Cypro -Minoan and their cosmopolitan origins. The aim was to try to reconstruct writing practices - how the act of writing was performed, with what instruments and materials, and using what methods. We know that when impressed in wet clay, Cypro -Minoan was written using some sort of rounded implement with a point (I usually use a cocktail stick or similar when trying to replicate Cypro -Minoan writing on modelling clay, filing down the tip a little), but we don't have any certain examples of surviving writing implements. In some cases, tablets with flat surfaces have been insc ribed by drawing the stylus through the wet clay to create quite large, linear signs. Tablets of this sort bear considerable similarity with methods of writing in Bronze Age Crete, although the Cretan stylus was clearly somewhat sharper and pointier. Howe ver at Enkomi, a major site in the east of Cyprus, three surviving tablets are of a completely different type: their surfaces are convex, and the lines making up each sign have not really been drawn through the clay, but rather have been impressed, with th e stylus at an angle. Further Cypro -Minoan documents have been found at Ugarit, an independent Bronze Age polity in modern Syria that is only a short boat ride away from Cyprus. The predominant writing systems at Ugarit were Akkadian cuneiform (that is. t he Mesopotamian type, syllabic) and Ugaritic cuneiform (a local variant, alphabetic), so the few tablets and labels written in Cypro -Minoan stand out as an anomaly, presumably written by Cypriots living or trading in Ugarit. Again, these tablets have curved, convex surfaces, with the appearance of 'cushion' -shaped tablets that were popular in the Near East. 96 Left: Cypro -Minoan tablet Cuneiform tablet New York Metropolitan Muse: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/325858 ) It may seem a small and insignifi cant detail to say that some Cypro -Minoan inscriptions were written by drawing the tip of the stylus through the clay in lines while others were made by impressing the tip of the stylus into the clay. But this is more than an issue of individual handwriti ng: everything about the writing method is different. What is really striking is that impressing the stylus into the clay in this way is very similar to what cuneiform scribes did in creating their clay documents. The cuneiform stylus was angular, either three - or four - sided, and when impressed in clay it made a distinctive wedge shape. Every cuneiform sign is made up of these wedges, forming a little complex of individual impressions of the tip of the stylus that is understood to convey a syllable (or in some cases a whole word). Although the Cypro -Minoan writing system had very different origins, in the examples of Cypro -Minoan clay tablets from Enkomi and Ugarit it is quite clear that what the scribe was doing involved moving and impressing a Cypriot st ylus in such a way that each Cypro -Minoan sign was created out of a series of individual impressions - just as if they were writing in cuneiform. This is a remarkable case of synthesis or hybridity of practices. 97 Although it has sometimes been suggested th at Cypriot scribes were becoming 'cuneiformised', this formulation unfairly removes their own agency in the situation. What they were doing was far more dynamic, marrying their distinct Cypriot writing system with practices and methods of writing that wer e popular in many areas of the Near East, from Mesopotamia to the Levant and even in Anatolia. If they wanted to assimilate such practices completely, it would in theory have been possible simply to adopt a form of cuneiform and write their own language i n it. The fact that they didn't do this suggests that the methods of writing employed in the Cypro -Minoan tablets from Enkomi and Ugarit were the result of thoughtful and deliberate actions and choices. At the same time, the hybridisation of writing prac tices suggests close proximity and familiarity with the way scribes worked in sites such as Ugarit and others around the Near East. My team wanted to substantiate these ideas of interactions with cuneiform practice by looking closely at the stylus impressions found in these tablets. We often had to work with photographs, especially in the case of the documents from Ugarit that have been kept in Syria, which cannot be available for study any time in the near future, if indeed they survive the war in tact. Practical experimentation (or 'clay play' as we usually call it!) informed our reconstruction of the shape of the stylus and its tip, the way it was held in the hand and the way it was angled as it was impressed into the clay. More recently, we als o had an exciting opportunity to collaborate with Martina Polig, a Visiting Fellow who is studying Cypro -Minoan palaeography (that is, both sign shapes and writing methods) using 3D scans taken with a textured light scanner. The level of detail from these scans is extraordinary, and allows us to measure the dimensions of each stylus impression to gain a far better understanding of the shape of the stylus tip and the way it was angled. Impressions made by different angles of the stylus 98 3D scan of a Cypro -Minoan tablet from Enkomi (Image courtesy of Martina Polig ) Experimentation and detailed examination helps to explain an interesting feature of Cypro -Minoan inscriptions like these tablets, and other clay documents especially from Enkomi: many of the str okes that make up individual script signs are in the distinctive form of a teardrop. Imagine a rounded stylus with a point, and what shape would be made if you sink the tip into the clay and then angle the stylus downwards, namely an impression that is poi nted at one end and round at the other. Although the teardrop shape was itself a product of a very specific set of circumstances, where a scribe used a rounded stylus and pressed it into wet clay when writing, it seems to have become iconic more widely an d can sometimes appear in other media. For example, some of the strokes made in paint on an ostracon, also from Bronze Age Enkomi, seem to imitate the distinctive teardrop shape despite the very different medium and method of writing. 99 Painted ostracon from Enkomi (Image courtesy of Silvia Ferrara ) The ways in which traditions and experiences of writing can themselves inform the way the practice develops, and the way it is regarded in society, are of great interest in understanding the broader picture of the history of writing. If anything, it often feels as though that history is a series of accidents or events that could have gone one way or another. Take the 'Roman' alphabet in which I am writing this piece: it is somewhat modified from the alphabet used by the ancient Romans, which in turn was derived from a particular regional variant of the Greek alphabet (one where H was not eta but 'h' and X was not chi but 'ks' just like our 'x'). This variant alphabet was used by Greek settlers in Italy, and was ultimately derived from the vowelless Phoenician alphabet, itself the 100 result of an experiment perhaps 1,000 years earlier in which speakers of a Semitic language (likely mine workers) in Egypt took inspiration from Egyptian hieroglyphs in creating their own writing system (sometimes referred to as Proto -Sinaitic after the Sinai peninsula). We have come a long way from Gelbian ideas about script ideals and evolution. There is nothing civilised or civilising about the Western alphabets, and nothing primit ive or inefficient about logographic and syllabographic writing systems - some of which, we must remember, exist around the world today and are not the preserve of the ancient past. The way in which writing systems encode language is only one aspect of their existence that can be studied, and the more we view writing as embedded and embodied social practice the more we can understand why writing traditions respond to all the comings and goings of cultural encounters in such fascinating and ultimately unpre dictable ways. P M S 101 DEVELOPING AUTOMATED ACOUSTIC DIAGNOSIS OF DYSPHAG IA In 2018, I was approached by Professor Joan Lasenby, who had been one of my supervisors for my Masters project, to help with a project on dysphagia. Joan had been asked, as an expert in signal processing, for help by a group of researchers, speech and language therapists, and clinical nurses from Sheffield Royal Hallamshire Hospital, led by Lise Sproson and Sue Pownall. My PhD, which Joan had also been in volved with, investigated the acoustics of the lung and gathered relevant acoustic data, and so I was recommended by Joan to the researchers from Sheffield. From that point on, I was involved in designing the data collection set -up and have since undertak en a significant portion of the data processing and analysis. Dysphagia is a broad term for any difficulty a person may have swallowing. This can be anything from taking a little longer to swallow larger or more viscous material, to a complete inability to swallow at all. The causes of dysphagia range from the fairly mechanical, muscle failure or blockage, to the neurological, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson's disease. Some cancers and their treatments can also damage the swallowing reflex. One particularly unpleasant form of the problem occurs when the throat fails to prevent food from entering the windpipe. In healthy patients, this would result in coughing, but for those with neurological conditions another side effect is a fail ure of the cough reflex, allowing food to enter the lungs. With large pieces of food this can cause choking, but more usually the pieces of food are small and enter the lung without any immediately obvious effect. However, the food is likely eventually t o cause pneumonia, which is potentially lethal for patients with the types of condition just listed. It is very important, therefore, to know whether food is entering the airways, which is called 'aspiration', because this can then be mitigated by using s pecial swallowing techniques and control of a patient's diet. The current gold standard for the detection of aspiration is fluoroscopy, which involves taking a live x -ray video of someone as they swallow food laced with barium (which shows up well on the x -ray). This process attempts directly to observe whether food is entering the airways. There are several disadvantages to this process: it involves a 102 significant radiation dose for the patient, it represents only their swallowing on a particular day, and it takes place in the rather artificial conditions of a fluoroscopy clinic. It also requires the patient to be able to respond to the directions from the clinicians, which can make aspiration effectively invisible for patients with some neurological cond itions. The ideal is therefore a method of detecting aspiration that does not require x -rays, and preferably one that could be used outside of a hospital where patients generally have a more limited ability to respond to questioning. Our aim is to use microphones placed on the throat to detect whether food is entering the lungs. We have been working with a team from the Sheffield Royal Hallamshire Hospital who run a clinic detecting aspiration. When a patient comes in for a fluorosco py, we place microphones at the cricothyroid ligament (the front and middle of the throat) and the suprasternal notch (the notch in the centre of the upper chest between the two collar bones). We record all of the patients' swallowing, coughing, and breat hing sounds while the x -ray video is being taken. The x -ray video can then be used to label all of the audio 103 files whether or not aspiration is happening, as well as other relevant information such as the position of the head and the timing of any swallow ings. This data allows us to use a basic form of machine learning. So far, we have collected data on 14 patients. The most important question to answer with this data concerns whether dysphagia changes the sounds we measure. The basic answer appears to b e yes, but in quite a specific way that makes detecting dysphagia non -trivial. We have found that only the swallowing sound shows a difference between healthy and unhealthy patients, and not, for example, the breathing sounds or coughing sounds. Specific ally, we have found that the swallowing sounds of patients with aspiration have more high frequency content. A Kruskal -Wallis statistical test tells us that the chance that the two sets of sounds are drawn from the same probability distribution is 3 per c ent, giving an encouraging indication that aspiration does change the swallowing sound. However, while the two data sets are drawn from different distributions, there is a great deal of overlap between these distributions, making a practical use of the so unds to distinguish aspiration difficult. We have found that traditional machine learning methods such as k -nearest neighbour and support vector machines can achieve a sensitivity and specificity of up to 75 per cent . While this is better than any other method not using fluoroscopy, it leaves much to be desired. Distinguishing sets of data that are noisy and where a simple metric is difficult to define is where modern machine learning methods, such as neural networks, have done very well in recent years. The results so far indicate that there is a difference there to be detected caused by aspiration, and the next step is to set up a much larger data collection study, of the order of 1,000 patients, so that the more modern machine learning tools can be imp lemented. Our results so far indicate that distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy swallowing sounds is difficult but possible. A different question that we can ask of the data we have collected is whether aspiration changes the swallowing sounds. T his is more than curiosity, given that any physical understanding can be used to help make machine learning methods more effective and intuitive. Our conclusion from looking at the 150 or so swallowing sounds that we have collected is that there are two m ain mechanisms for such sounds. First, there are many 'closing events' during each swallow, including, for 104 example, the closure of the epiglottis, the tongue moving to be against the roof of the mouth, and the closure of the nasal cavity. These all produce a 'thump' sound caused by the brief vibration of tissue colliding. Second, there are 'gurgle' sounds caused by the movement of fluid through the throat. These sounds are caused by vibrations of small bubbles within the fluid. Both of these sounds hav e broad frequency spectrums. The difference between healthy and unhealthy sounds appears to be the number and timing of the 'thump' and 'gurgle' sounds produced. Healthy patients tend to have very brief swallowing sounds, with the food or water spending very little time in their throats. Patients suffering from dysphagia tend to have a more prolonged swallow, as the reflex has become more confused and less controlled. This results in more 'thump' and 'gurgle' sounds are spread out over a longer time. W e believe that this is why aspirating patients have swallowing sounds with greater high frequency content. This suggests that a promising approach to the use of machine learning would be to train a system to distinguish the 'thump' and 'gurgle' sounds, an d the timing of these sounds could be used to gauge the general health of the swallowing process. The overall aim of our research group in Cambridge (acoustics.eng.cam.ac.uk) is to develop a modern stethoscope. By using the work detailed here the new stet hoscope will be able to provide a semi - automated diagnosis of dysphagia without the need for fluoroscopy. This will enable us to catch dysphagia at an earlier stage and in a broader spectrum of patients. It would have a significant effect on their qualit y of life. A G 105 PAINTING THE MASTER (Photo: Emily Guerry ) When I discovered that Rowan - The Rt Revd and the Rt Hon the Lord Williams of Oystermouth - would become Master of Magdalene, I was standing near the Pepys Library at the 2011 May Ball, as the guest of a friend in her final year. I turned to her and excl aimed, 'Oh, it would be my dream commission to paint his portrait for the College one day'. I first met Archbishop Rowan, as I knew him then, back in 2003, when a family friend working in Christian radio had mentioned to his wife Jane that I would love to paint him. He kindly agreed. I had just graduated from Falmouth College of Art and cultivated a somewhat Scrappy Doo 'Let me at 'em ' approach as a fledgling portrait artist. That same year, I'd commandeered the then Home Secretary David Blunkett to sit for me; I managed to get this painting in the BP Portrait Prize exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery and sold the piece to the Palace of Westminster. I was a gutsy young thing, but I vividly remember the first morning I came down the stairs at Lambeth Palace, after staying the night in a little room normally occupied by visiting vicars. When I saw Rowan at the end of the corrid or - in his floor -length ecclesiastical robes, looking at the 106 morning's papers laid out on a table - I jumped back behind a column and hid. I did tiptoe out eventually, and produced a little head study in loose, fresh strokes that form a gentle face, live ly eyes and a direct gaze. So I think you can perhaps imagine my delight when I received a text one day from my dear friend Dr Emily Guerry, which said that her friend, your Dr Munns, wanted to see if I might be interested in painting Rowan's portrait to c ommemorate his Mastership of the College. Of all the artists in all the kingdom, he had chosen me! When Jo Hornsby contacted me to discuss logistics and book dates for the sittings, I decided to ask for the moon on a stick and then work backwards from the re to whatever I was given. 'Five days in a row, please,' I requested. I paint best from life, in a concentrated fury of wet - on-wet layers of pigment, executed in a compressed, intense period of time. If it's going well, then don't stop me; I'll never p ick up in the same place. Jo quite reasonably said this was highly unlikely, but, to everybody's surprise, a working week in April 2019 was available in his diary. I also was given one day in March to come with my camera, studio light, and charcoal to wo rk out the composition. And so it was that I found myself in the Master's Lodge, rolling up rugs, closing all the curtains, and draping brown fabric over a door. The way that light falls across a subject is one of the most crucial components for me when I design a portrait. Placing my LED dimmable lamp on an adjustable stand enabled me to create a single dominant light source above and to the left of Rowan. This helped to establish the strong chiaroscuro effect I wanted, referencing the Spanish Catholic artists I love so much. In fact, the subtle arch in which I set the composition was lifted directly from one of Zurbaran's paintings of St Francis. I wanted to represent and reflect the profound theological wisdom that underpins Rowan's rigorous scholarsh ip, and the quiet power of his kindness, without the obvious iconographic signifiers of his previous role as a prelate. There would be no crosses or vestments; instead, a head tilted heavenwards, with a small book resting in his hands. The book is Artist and Epoch , a collection of essays by the Welsh artist and poet David Jones. The distinctive lettering was designed by Jones himself. Two previous contenders had been plucked from the shelves at random. For such a lover of books, this arbitrary approach was preferable to the potentially time -consuming task of actively choosing the perfect title during our sittings. The first 'prop' he grabbed was On 107 Thomas Merton by Mary Gordon. It appears in my initial charcoal sketch, but I didn't like the way his fin gers interacted with the typographical layout. And so it came to pass that for much of the sittings Rowan was clutching a book with LOST CHRISTIANITY emblazoned across the top in Gothic script. 'Hmmm,' I mused. The optics of this choice could be somewhat controversial, but perhaps it would make the painting very famous (if for all the wrong reasons). Very selflessly (I thought), I eventually pointed this out to Rowan, and, after a joint shelf forage, we decided on David Jones. This book and the author d irectly connect the portrait to Rowan's deep love of his homeland, and of poetry too. Rowan's contemplative temperament makes him an ideal sitter. His calm presence is receptive and generous. He is ego -less and unendingly patient. He also never fidgets, which is something every portrait painter dreads. He displayed much grace when I declared loudly (and with some irritation) there was something wrong with his thumb. I was quick to clarify that I meant my rendering of his thumb and that his digit was pe rfectly OK. We both broke off and studied the canvas. I would often pick up the portrait and carry it into the light of the hall where I could squint at it from a distance cross -legged on the marble, and Rowan was a supportive pillar at my shoulder. Although it meant wiping off the equivalent of an hour's worth of him holding a gruelling pose, he was so patient as I repainted it. At times, my progress was tested by bright, shifting sunlight streaming through the curtains, which was certainly a challenge for my execution of the chiaroscuro. I huffed and sighed, and Rowan always sympathised with my frustration. At one point, the sun finally went in, and I had a good stretch of uninterrupted tonal values. Rowan noted my change of fortunes. ' Yes', I rema rked with a twinkle, 'did you \"have a word\"?' He responded with one of his lovely warm chuckles. (I'm pretty sure he did...) As it turned out, I only needed four days, not five. 'I know,' I said to Rowan 'I won't tell anyone I've finished, so you can ju st come in here and read a book or write a poem and no one will know!' As someone who is endlessly busy with so many responsibilities, it made perfect sense when he told me that sometimes he feels happiest when on a train journey, with nothing to do and n o one to bother him, with just an idea for a poem, a notebook and a pen. 108 It is the Celtic poet in Rowan that manifested in a smaller companion piece that I produced around the same time as the official portrait for Magdalene. It's called The White Druid o f the Gorsedd of Bards, referencing and celebrating his Welsh cultural honour. Executed on prehistoric bog oak unearthed after 5000 years in the ground, I captured his head in oil pigment and sun -bleached beeswax. I originally developed this technique fo r a portrait of the author Neil Gaiman in an attempt to reflect the mind of a man whose oeuvre is steeped in ancient myth. I took my inspiration from the Fayum mummy portraits - those lively, loving depictions of the dead developed in Late Antique Egyptia n communities. Rather than using coloured wax, I applied layers of clear wax and suspended oil between them, so that the image lies beneath the surface, seemingly within the ancient wood itself. Rowan has a mystical, mythical, wise presence to him, and h e was the ideal subject for further exploration with an inventive but still ancient technique. The shadows are almost entirely the blackened wood itself, and cloudy wax evokes the mists of the Welsh valleys. It's Rowan the poet, the Welsh mystic, the wildness in him that the Church never tamed. Lorna May Wadsworth The College commissioned portrait is framed using prehistoric bog oak, linking it with the smaller head rendered on bog oak with wax. Lorna gilded both the edges of the canvas and the interior of the frame with 24 carat gold, giving the impression of a tiny penumbra of light or halo around the image.

In a summation of his years of archival research and shrewd reflection, Gareth Atkins (Research Fellow 2009 -18) has produced a book that profoundly transforms our understanding not only of the nature and influence of the evangelicalism most associated with the Clapham Sect or 'the Saint s' and their followers, but of the wider political and societal changes of the early and mid - nineteenth century. Evangelicalism is patiently and minutely interrogated as a powerful political force that tentacled into every facet of the British establishme nt and its expanding overseas empire. The traditional narrative of the godliness of the friends of Wilberforce and the moral heroism of the man himself has been overlaid in recent years by greater attention to a wider cast of proponents of abolitionism. A s this invigorating study argues, however, the new focus falls short in understanding the extent of a determining Evangelicalism with its mission to rejuvenate Britain as a Christian nation. The first part of the book considers largely metropolitan cleric al and lay patronage networks and associations by which evangelicals engaged in public life between about 1770 and 1840. The masterly opening survey of the clergy is a handsome reward for tremendous archival and bibliographical toil. It also rehearses the critical contribution of Magdalene, for not only was Peter Peckard (Master 1781 -97) a renowned abolitionist (although not an Evangelical) and an inspiration for and supporter of Thomas Clarkson, Olaudah Equiano and Wilberforce, but a surprisingly large number of students and Fellows also advanced the cause. Notable among them 110 were Samuel Hey (1745 -1828), William Farish continuing stream of indigent northerners'. The second part of the book exami nes how evangelicals entered offices and institutions in Britain, including the universities and armed forces, but also in the wider British world, notably investigating their influence in the navy, the Sierra Leone Company, and the East India Company. By its finely nuanced account of evangelical politics and activism, Converting Britannia maps the world of establishment Evangelicalism, accounts for its influences and reveals the multifarious political, social and institutional means and structures sustaini ng its campaigning. Advocates used print technology, publicity, and business proficiency to promote seductive messaging. Such activity pr esaged later philanthropic orga nisation and an astute voluntarist appreciation of how power operated and how to acces s it. This was something that 'arguably stands between early modern confessionalism and \"religious modernity\"'. Certainly, the ways by which religious reformism was strengthened are formidably presented. Evangelicalism, we can now better appreciate, was far more than a religious and social intervention but a highly effective political force at home and abroad. The mapping of such international outreach is an outstanding strength of this study. N etworks spanned the churches, universities, commercial and f inancial organizations, the military and municipal and national institutions. And these connected London and the regions with Europe and the world by means of metropolitan businesses, the navy, the Colonial Office and the great trading Companies. Atkins details the cheap print, the mass -production and the technologies that sustained religion in a rapidly modernizing age and carried it to new contexts abroad. Around the globe, religion drove debates about British history. Indeed, such was the emphasis on promoting far and wide the political and national character that it might be thought that for the most ambitious this was actually 'coveting Britannia'. Such study is not easy. There are real methodological challenges in trying to capture the varying rel ationships within the networks and how these change over time and according to particular environments. Great care is taken to show that beliefs and connections are not always coherent and that there is a variability about their development. Above all, ho wever, t his study recalibrates what it meant to be an Anglican 111 Protestant in the nineteenth century and how Evangelicalism intersected with campaigns for constitutional change and how its language helped determine political debate between the 1820s and 187 0s. In part, this involved a reframing of older concerns about the dangers of luxur y, effeminacy, and corruption, continuing criticisms of nouveau -riche commercialism and re -emphasising the proper responsibilities of the rich. Too often these anxieties, which have been central to recent writings of social and cultural historians of the eighteenth century, have not found a place in histories of the early nineteenth century. Not the least important contribution of this book is its recognition of how this a genda was continued and given new shape and impetus in the nineteenth century, re -energised by evangelical vision and acuity. An age of decorum which replaced a more superficially polite and yet in many ways rakish and licentious world, encouraged a butto ned-up Britain in which for so many and in so many places reformism was built upon piety and rectitude. J J R HANNAH CRITCHLOW , The Science of Fate: Why Your Future is More Predictable Than You Think (Hodder & Stoughton, 2019, 256 pp) This seductive book examines how much of our life is predetermined at birth and to what extent we are in control of our destiny. Huge advances in technologies have allowed us better to understand our brains, the origins of our complex behaviours, and the sequencing of our DNA, but also to edit our DNA and revolutionise IVF techniques and practices. As this book implicitly argues, greater knowledge about the unique cartography of our minds makes us appreciate all the more how different we are from each oth er: discussions about destiny and fate effectively underpin broader considerations of humanity. In 112 particular, as we know more about how genetics drives our lives, we also have more certain evidence for things that we can do to shape our own outcomes. In developing this argument, the book explores the plasticity of our brains. A highly influential study 2000 showed how the brains of London black taxi -drivers changed as they took the Knowledge. The hippocampus, which is involved in navigation, learning and memory, enlarged in cabbies who passed the test. Brains, it seemed, could be honed in the same way as muscle and change ingrained habits. More recently, however, new research on genomics and studies of how DNA directs neural circuit formation in babies at just 20 weeks' gestation, suggests that many behaviours are ingrained or coded from very early on. Nature not nu rture. The basic neural circuitry that acts as foundation for our life is already there from birth. Much of human anxiety, obesity, depressio n and addictive behaviours might be attributed to heredity. But also, all these behaviours might be amplified and reinforced by the decisions of a child's parents. In her book, Hannah Critchlow also suggests that 'affection is a neurochemical event' and explores scientific studies that explain the idea that opposites attract. How much does fate determine our choice of a partner? One research project concludes that women rate men more attractive if their MHC [major histocompatibility complex] systems differ markedly from their own because their offspring will then have a stronger immune system to combat potential infections. Conversely, however, when asked to think about their partners, the brains of long - together couples reacted in much the same way as a drug addict's. Addictive love indeed. A great strength of the book is its appeal to so many interests and disciplines . Historians, anthropologists and sociologist s, among many others, will be fascinated by the chapter that examines the formation of belief and how genes, traits and experiences shape our views. Numerous scholars are now investigating how the different profiles of brains are associated with different ideologies. It is claimed that the brains of those with very conservative views have a much larger volume and a much more sensitive amygdala - the area of the brain that is involved in perceptions of fear. Those of more liberal inclination seem to have a greater weighting on the region of the brain that is engaged with future planning and more collaborative endeavour. Liberals look to the future 113 and seem less sensitive to immediate threats. This leads to questions about how neuroscience might affect ho w we change our minds and go about winning an argument . The study has, therefore, key implications for those working on questions of civility, persuasiveness, and divisiveness in public discourse, suggesting that the way in which we build up perceptions o f the world strengthens the way in which we ignore contrary views and evidence. Changing minds simply becomes too cognitively (and socially) costly. In such ways the future might indeed be more predictable than we think - but also more ethically challeng ing as technology offers more opportunities to screen embryos and to edit genes with the aim of selecting or avoiding particular human traits. Such concerns are far from new: what this book describes so fully is how our brains process information in ways that mechanistically guide and regulate our behaviour. The decisions that we think we are consciously making are illusions that can be reduced to what our brains are telling us to do. J R R EAMON DUFFY, John Henry Newman , A Very Brief Histor y (SPCK Publishing, 2019 , 128 pp) I arrived in Magdalene, a new Chaplain, a little over thirty years ago. It was the year the College admitted women and, in so many ways, a previous generation held sway. Just before I arrived, someone had crept into Chapel, u nder cover of darkness, and removed all the Books of Common Prayer, replacing them with copies of Country Life . I had been interviewed by Mickey Dias and John Stevens. It was decided that a new and untried Chaplain, on his first Sunday, would b e over -stretched just managing Choral Evensong in the College Chapel. So, instead of preaching myself in, Den nis 114 Babbage read from Little Gidding , a voice like a double bass and hints of gravel underfoot. As a consequence, preaching in Magdalene immediately loomed large for me: this was clearly a th ing of weight and moment. I negotiated a first sermon without incident. It was the second attempt that was the issue. I was rather pleased with it and, afterwards, after a couple of glasses of claret on High Table, I swept down the Hall and up the Combination Room stairs on a smug tide of well -being. As I stepped through the door, a trap snapped shut. Either side of me, were Dr Duffy and Dr Boyle: 'What was that that the Chaplain was preaching tonight? Was it Patrip assianism, or was it just Satanism?' That night began the deconstruction and rebuilding of my theological world. It was a conversation that changed me and changed the course of my ministry. This story comes back to me now because, if you read Eamon Duffy on Newman, you are plunged into that same world of interrogation and intellectual ferment. It is not quite a biography; this is, rather, an encounter with Newman the theologian. Here is 'the puzzle and difficulty of belief in God' lived out in a man wit h colossal gifts of understanding and speech. It is a book that makes Newman vivid and compelling. Other writers have been smothered by a weight of expectation, or have found an angular man and offered angular assessment. This short book, acknowledging the difficulties others have described, finds space to offer us instead a brilliant and flawed man, for whom theology and faith were formative. Duffy races after Newman, himself intrigued and excited by that questing mind. Newman on the development of doctrine, Newman on why we believe, Newman on what universities are for, Newman on the papacy. The questions and debates become real and contemporary. It is an invitation to engage. Duffy almost tumbles over himself as he rushes to cover so much ground . Almost , tumbling over, but always strangely measured and pointing onwards. The enthusiasm for this 'man of letters', is seasoned with such wonderful examples of Newman's prose that he has you reaching for copies of his books. The most famous, and, in D uffy's mind, 'most beautiful' of those books, is the Apologia Pro Vita Sua . Newman wrote it after a Magdalene man, Charles Kingsley, launched an unprovoked attack on his integrity. Responding, Newman threw himself into a work of religious autobiography. Standing (as was his custom) at his desk for staggeringly long periods - twenty -two hours on one shattering day - to write in a 115 state of emotional turmoil. He described being ' constantly in tears, and constantly crying out in distress'. That emotion; th at 'thin skinned' sensitivity, coupled with Newman's craggy resilience, produced remarkable prose : To consider the world in its length and breadth, its various history, the many races of man, their starts, their fortunes, their mutual alienation, their conflicts; and then their ways, habits, governments, forms of worship; their enterprises, their aimless courses, their random achievements, and acquirements... - all this is a vision to dizzy and appal; and inflicts upon the mind the sense of a profound myst ery, which is absolutely beyond human solution . It was that mystery that gripped Newman and drove him on; it fuelled a restless desire to understand and explain which could never be satisfied. Duffy hands it on to us here , as he handed it to me that nigh t in Magdalene. Just before I left the College, there was an evening celebration of Newman. Eamon Duffy and Nicholas Lash put together prose, poet ry, pictures, and some music. We heard that night a letter read. It was a letter to his nephew and it is qu oted in this book. Newman the theologian gently challenges pious platitudes about the 'afterlife' and notes that his nephew looked for a more conventional grief. The letter ends Yours affectly John H Card. Newman P.S. Cardinals don't wear mourning As t he reading ended, up came the Millais portrait of Newman, resplendent, in scarlet. It is that same, vivid Newman that we meet here. D M H 116 JOSEPH JARRETT, Mathematics and Late Elizabethan Drama (Palgrave Macmillan, 2019 , xi + 242 pp, 9 figures) Lest any exclusively humanities - minded readers should be alarmed by the title of Joe Jarrett's book, they should be reassured that it is not an exercise in line -counting and the symbolism of numbers. It is both more accessible and more interesting than th at: it is a study of various of the changes and developments in mathematical understanding at the end of Elizabeth's reign, the networks through which those developments were communicated, and how, and how much, five playwrights writing for the popular stage show knowledge of the new mathematics and deployed it in their writings. The introduction explores the new interest in mathematics in all its branches - among them mechanics, cosmology, navigation, the geometry of three -dimensional bodies (occasionally illustrated in textbooks with spaces for pop -up models to be pasted in), architecture, surveying, the new science of algebra ('cossical numbers'), and, at the astrologer -physician John extreme end, kabbalist number mysticism. They were investi gated and promoted in particular by a group that included men such as Thomas Herriot to higher -profile public figures such as Sir Walter Raleigh and the 'wizard' earl of Northumberland, who met at Dee's house at Mortlake. An increasing number of English -language technical books helped to spread the ideas beyond whatever was taught in the universities. Jarrett focuses his discussion on one play selected for each dramatist, though Marlowe is allowed the two parts of Tamburlaine (1587). The others are Robert Greene's Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay (1589); Thomas Dekker's Old Fortunatus (1599); Shakespeare's Hamlet (?1600); and Henry Chettle's The Tragedy of Hoffman (1603). Each chapter then focuses on how the play under discussion engages with a single field of 117 contemporary mathematics, whether through direct knowledge or by thought -provoking analogy. Evidence of familiarity with a work on the mathematics of military architecture, Paul Ives' The Practise of Fortification , appears in the ex position of the best design for a fort in Tamburlaine , where the technical terminology of quinque -angles, counterscarps and argins is absorbed into the incantatory rhetoric of the hero's world conquests. A more fictional use of maths as a route to magic emerges in Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay , whose primary title character, the thirteenth -century philosopher Roger Bacon, is able to show other characters what is happening far away, in a kind of medieval YouT ube - though the main result of the key apparition is that several of the characters murder each other. The vision is shown by means of a magic mirror; but as with all such staged scenes of magic (including here a talking head and teleportation), it obviously had to be performed by non - magical means, and Jarrett's discussion of how a mirror might have been used in the staging perhaps underestimates the audience's practice in using their imaginations. Old Fortunatus reads like two different plays stuck together, one a morality involving Fortune and Virtue , the other the story of a man who acquires a magically refilling purse and a wishing hat. The mathematical link here comes from the imagery of the circle, used principally in the Fortune scenes. The circle already had a rich symbolic history, as represe nting both eternity and the ever -turning Wheel of Fortune. The adoption of Arabic numerals in the course of the sixteenth century added the further meaning of zero, nought, as played on most strikingly in the Prologue to Henry V , where it is pointed out t hat adding nothing (or a series of nothings) to a single figure can turn a solo actor into a million, so cutting the Gordian knot of how to represent mighty armies within the 'wooden O' of the playhouse. Jarrett's most extensive study of Shakespeare howev er is of Hamlet , and its bringing together of extremes of large and small: that a man can be at once 'infinite in faculties', capable of comprehending the cosmos, and yet finally nothing more than 'quintessence of dust'. Dust was often used as a synonym f or a particle of matter so small as to be indivisible, an atom or (as Shakespeare spelled it) atomie; his use of the word in relation to matter rather than time, which has a longer heritage, foreshadows the fascination with Lucretian ideas of matter that b ecame of particular interest in the seventeenth century. 118 The final chapter of the book discusses the contrasting ideas of revenge as either arithmetical (as in 'an eye for an eye') or geometrical: that the principle of equity in the execution of justice m ay allow for a bloodbath, as in The Tragedy of Hoffman. For the purposes of the book, whether Chettle or his audience was interested in the mathematics (as contemporary thinkers such as Francis Bacon certainly were) finally matters less than the analogies between justice and revenge. Perhaps in the case of that most popular of genres, revenge tragedy, it was the stage that set the mathematicians to wondering. E H C ALI MEGH JI, Black M iddle-Class Britannia: Identities, Repertoires, Cultural Consumption (Manchester University Press, 2019, 190 pp). As an author one always hopes that, even if the subject matter is not topical at the time of publication, it might become topical soon thereafter. I doubt that, even in his wildest dreams, Dr Meghj i would have thought his book was to be so important a few months after publication. Unfortunately, it took the combination of the brutal death of a black man by a white policeman, and perhaps even more crucially, the inflammatory reactions of President T rump, to put race back under the global spotlight. Ali Meghji's book is (as the title suggests) about the United Kingdom. Rather than concentrating on the economic disadvantages experienced by Black adults in this country, or the way in which they are dis criminated against by police or other institutions, the book focuses firmly on their consumption of culture. Furthermore, rather than treating racial disadvantage in a similar way to sociological treatments of advantage and disadvantage associated with social class, his research participants are solely drawn from the Black middle class. 119 It becomes very clear in the author's interviews with Black individuals that the ways in which his respondents consume culture (including art, music, and film) are importan t to them, but hugely variable in terms of the centrality of their race to the choices they make. Megh ji makes sense of this by categorising them into three ideal types - his 'triangle of Identity'. People in one group, 'class -minded', deny that they are in any way the victims of racism, describe the UK as a post -racial society, and make no particular effort to seek out black artists or musicians. For them, their middle class defines what they consume, and they want to share their experiences with others in the (mainly white) middle class. The opposite group is described as 'ethnoracial autonomous' and its members have a clear preference for cultural forms they would describe as 'Black', self -selecting out of 'White spaces' such as opera houses and art g alleries. The third, group, labelled 'Strategic Assimilation', mixes these two patterns and its adherents are aware of both their class and colour in how they identify with and consume culture. Having said that, there are some points of near unanimity bet ween the respondents, most notably in id entifying 'white spaces' where B lacks are likely to be made to feel uncomfortable by 'micro -aggressions' such as being watched closely by security guards or patronised by Whites in those spaces with comments such as 'is this your first time here?'. But it is the different ways in which Black people describe their attitudes, feelings, and behaviours that make this such an interesting book - and Megh ji clearly enjoys recounting their experiences and the experiences he shares with them. The book achieves a lot in bringing together critical race theory and cultural sociology, and it is easy to see from the book why the author's PhD was received with such acclaim. It is highly original and well written. The book sticks t o a clear focus; it leaves the reader with many unanswered questions. For instance, to what extent can the findings be generalised to other minorities in British society (such as Romani, Irish, South Asian or Eastern European immigrants), or is there some thing distinctive about being Black in Britain? Is the category of 'middle class' in the British context too broad, ranging from less skilled white -collar jobs to elite jobs such as barristers and medical doctors? What about more popularly consumed cultu re, such as Hollywood films and pop music? The book focuses more on elite culture such as fine art and 120 classical music. Are there distinct advantages, both personally and socially, for individuals who fuse the cultures of their parents and the society th ey live in, as suggested by the lit erature on 'Third Culture Kids'? The book concludes with an appendix on research methodology, where Ali Meghji turns the spotlight to the way in which he conducted the research. He reflects upon his own presence in the interviews as a young British South Asian man, so occupying an identity that is c learly different from both the African and Caribbean diasporas he studies and also from the White majority; sometimes he can identify strongly with the experiences of the Blac k participants in his research (for instance when the gallery security guards are clearly concerned that his back -pack might contain a bomb) , yet he also acknowledges that being of Pakistani heritage is not the same as being Black. He thus combines moment s of insider -ness and outsider -ness that give him insights that other researchers might overlook. This is a great section and just as engaging as the six chapters that precede it; I shall recommend this appendix as essential reading for all my PhD student s doing qualitative research. This book deserves a wide audience. It makes a compelling case for how, even for the materially and educationally advantaged Black citizens in this country, much of their everyday experiences is defined by race, albeit in mor e subtle ways than working -class Black people. But the book stops short of suggesting policies to move Britain beyond the persistent inequalities based on race that are so widely recognised as a major problem for our society (as evidenced by the strong su pport for the Black Lives Matter movement). Dr Meghji started studying Sociology as a Magdalene College undergraduate only eight years ago, so he still has some time left to think some more about Britannia, race, and class. B B 121 JOHN MOLE , Gold to Gold (Nottingham, Shoestring Press, 2020, 74 pp) Driven by language, as a pianist by the sight of ivories... It is a characteristically luminous image. One of John Mole's gifts as a poet is to find simple and robustly material metaphors like this: a passionate temperament as someone with no thermostat, a haystack as a 'gold block/...the currency of wartime innocence', the earth's 'cracked face of exhaustion' in a drought. Some of the poems here are essentially a sustained riff on a single metaphoric al economical final poem, 'Moving On'), and none the worse for that. Others (like 'Open Ground') are a quietly unfolded statement, unfolding with a patent logic an d yet delivering a surprise: beginning from Pierre Bonnard's maxim, 'The one who sings is not always happy', we are shown how singing is not an achievement or even activity so much as a place - 'open ground' - where we invite the song to arrive, like sunli ght spreading around the leaves of a tree. This particular image, of absence slowly inviting light, is an appropriate one for a collection in which several poems address the deep hurt of bereavement - stated with great directness in the title poem , the two wedding rings now worn on one hand, 'the two of us together/side by side who never made it/to our fiftieth anniversary.' 'Diagonal', beginning with the angle of a body in a bed now too large for one, briefly but very intensely sketches the sense of loss and undiminished intimacy woven painfully together, 'embracing absence /like the lost half of a kiss'. These poems of clear -eyed mourning are what gives the collection real and lasting weight, and they will bear a good deal of re -reading. Which is not to say that the others are all slight by any means. A few - 'August for the Boys', 'On a Painting by Grant Wood', 'At a Literary Party', 'Comma', and others - are skilful exercises, sometimes ('The Punch and Judy Man') containing an unexpect ed final thrust, sometimes 122 left as it were without comment. The technical skill is clear throughout, whether exhibited in formal rhyming or in the sheer measured balance of a long line (both in 'Bly', memorably). The poems about wartime childhood experie nce, short -lined, gnomic, unassertive, are finely done (I especially liked 'The Socks'), and similar techniques are deployed to good effect in the sequence 'On the Train'. Several of the comments on the cover allude to his delicacy and lightness of touch and that is certainly one of the impressions left by very many of these pieces, like the childhood poems and some of the reflections on bereavement. But I'm not sure that 'delicacy' should be the last word; hence my referring earlier to the 'robustly mate rial' dimension here. The one thing these poems are not is in any way 'discarnate'. If there is a 'lightness', it is not a sort of thistledown looseness of anchorage. The passion is manifest, and so is the fleshly burden of loss. Restrained and sometim es wry, these are for the most part deeply adult poems in their unemphatic seriousness, their willingness to show more than tell. R D W P J BOYES, & P.M STEELE, (eds), Understanding Relations between Scripts II: Early Alphabets (Oxford: Oxbow, 20 20, 240 pp) The greatest international tribute of academia that can be accorded to a scholar at a university of the European Union is the award of a European Research Council (ERC) grant to study an outstanding scientific question. This volume is one ri ch outcome of such funding. There is no more fundamental question, in the study of the most recent four thousand years of human development, than the alphabet, the focus of this stimulating volume. Many of us are educated to consider the alphabet a produ ct of Greek civilisation, an interpretation that this excellent volume dismantles by presenting a series of case studies from the 123 Mediterranean and the Near East that show the historical complexity and variation of the alphabetic form. What is an alphabet? We are taught the answer in our earliest education. The introduction elegantly crafts a more studied answer to this question. Can an alphabet lack vowels? This volume takes the approach that alphabets with vowels cannot be understo od without the historical context of consonant alphabets from the Semitic World, notably Phoenician which lack vowels. This takes us into a world that is much more plural, fuzzy and experimental, lacking the certainties of the education of our childhood. The development of the alphabet is not a simple evolution into the supreme achievement of Greek exceptionalism. The nine case studies that illustrate this plurality and complexity cover a substantial range. The first covers cuneiform, a technique with a much longer history, here employed in Ugarit to write the alphabetic script on clay, a product of functionality, efficiency and exploitation of ready -made tools. This contribution explicitly tries to break down the divisions between the worlds of language and archaeology. A closely following contribution similarly breaks down our preconceptions by finding in Egypt the inspiration for the alphabet, an alphabetic consciousness in hieroglyphics. The majority of the remaining contributions, five in number, ra nge over Phoenician and Greek scripts. One particularly interesting contribution challenges the simple traditional idea that the Greek alphabet was the origin of all scripts, derived itself from the Phoenician. The author envisages a network of parallel alphabets emerging from an alphabet yet to be discovered archaeologically. The contribution by our Magdalene Research Fellow, Philippa Steele, masterfully covers the variation and standardisation in Greek scripts, within a broader Mediterranean context. She shares the view that we should see alphabetisation as a Mediterranean rather than a purely Greek achievement. In this vein, the final two case studies are from the central and the Western Mediterranean. The Umbrian case study is a more strictly philolo gical account taking a well -defined route through the available evidence. The Iberian case study emphasises the connections with the Phoenician world. A thread that runs throughout the volume is that we are dealing with a sub -sample of the alphabetic scri pts originally written. We have 124the record of clay and stone, but not of papyrus and cloth. The authors are collectively skilled in producing elegant arguments in our own alphabetic script that complete the picture not found in the material record, provid ing a value to scholarship more than worthy of an ERC grant.
