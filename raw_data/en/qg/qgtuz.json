DOs emphasize a whole-person approach to treatment and receive extra training in the musculoskeletal system called osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT). DOs at One Medical typically practice in the field of family medicine, geriatrics, pediatrics, or internal medicine, and may also integrate OMT. My approach to health care is holistic, focusing on the mind-body connection. I believe my relationship with a patient is more of a partnership as we work together to find the best way to optimize one's quality of life and well-being. I like to use a more natural, organic approach with my care and strive to give people the opportunity to be self-advocates for their health. My interests include women's health, fitness/nutrition, and integrative medicine.
