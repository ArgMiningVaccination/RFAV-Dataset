These are used to help guide patients towards better health by treating the root cause of disease, not just suppressing the symptoms with medication. Good health and wellness are what Naturopathic Treatment is all about the role of a Naturopath is to work with a person to promote the natural healing of the body. Naturopathy is rooted in the belief that health is more than just the absence of disease and works on strengthening the body's natural defenses. naturopathy gives your body everything it needs to do the work of healing and staying healthy. When your body has the building blocks it needs, it is self-healing unless the issues are particularly serious or have been going on for an extended period. [Naturopathy](https://myfitbrain.in/blog/naturopathy-treatment-and-six-principles-of-naturopathy) is distinct from traditional Western medicine, which is what most primary doctors practice. The emphasis in naturopathic medicine is prevention and health promotion rather than symptom treatment. Naturopaths are doctors in every sense of the word, and the practice of naturopathy is evidence-based, just as Western medicine is. Instead of prescribing drugs that force unnatural treatment on the body (and have numerous side effects), naturopathy works within the body's natural processes to effect healing. There should be very few side effects after the initial treatment begins. However, sometimes a body is so damaged from toxins and unhealthy living that the person feels a little worse before he or she feels better. Naturopathic medicine recognizes the individual's ability to heal himself or herself. It promotes processes that help heal and removes obstacles to health. Naturopathic physicians practice the six fundamental principles of naturopathic medicine: Unlike Western medicine, which merely remedies symptoms, naturopathy seeks to find and treat the causes of disease. Every naturopath avoids using harmful medications and treatment methods, will not suppress symptoms in most cases, and aligns treatment with the individual's self-healing ability.

Since ancient times, herbal medicine has been used by many different cultures throughout the world to treat illness and to assist bodily functions However, with so many different practitioners, treatments and approaches huddled under one umbrella, it doesn't seem fair to say that naturopathy as a whole is effective or ineffective. Some naturopathic recommendations, like eating fresh vegetables and getting enough [sleep](https://myfitbrain.in/sleep-disorders-counselling), are scientifically proven no-brainers.

Changes in diet, nutritional supplements, and exercise could fix or improve high cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes. One could argue that taking cholesterol medication is safer by lowering your cholesterol. However if you can achieve equal results with the above, you avoid the added risks from the medication. This added safety while achieving the same outcome is one of the hallmarks of natural-based medicine. You may have heard the ancient cliche \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cures.\" Natural based medicine are well known for their preventative approach as they seek to identify and treat health problems before they turn into illnesses. For example, acupuncture seeks to maintain balance and synergy of the entire body and system.

Many who rely on conventional medicine are usually seeking help only after something goes wrong. In the end, they pay more in health care costs. Dietary supplements, herbal medicine, massage, reflexology, biofeedback, meditation, yoga, and the like can be practiced or used by just about anyone.

Conventional medicine can be powerful and effective at treating symptoms of illness once these symptoms appear, but they usually don't treat the cause. While you cover the symptoms up with a pill, the disease state continues to progress and so too does your health. The conventional medicines may leave patients with additional problems from the side effects. Natural-based medicine look to treat the cause of illness and through this, they treat the symptoms.
