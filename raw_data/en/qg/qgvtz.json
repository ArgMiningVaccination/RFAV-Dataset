Among the hundreds of different types of healing stones and crystals, each one has their own unique gemstone meanings and healing effects on the mind-body-spirit. Individual Crystal Meanings FILTER CRYSTALS BY LETTER: Types of Gemstones The definition of a crystal is a group of atoms that repeat themselves over and over again, making up a crystalline structure of various formations. This steady rhythm falls in sync with the healing vibrations of Earth, which can help balance and realign our energy centers. Nature's stunning jewelry box, the mineral kingdom, includes hundreds of different types of healing stones, from rough rocks to delicate specimens with a polished luster. Raw Or Rough Crystals Rough or raw crystals like Amethyst and Rose Quartz are the untouched chunks of rock that come from the Earth. When left in their natural state, you can connect with them at a deeper level. The gentle and diffused energy can have a subtle effect on a room or emotional state. Clusters & Geodes With a hollow formation filled with crystals, clusters and geodes are beautiful to look at and also have powerful frequencies. Even a small or medium size geode can have a significant calming and purifying effect on a room. Slices Gemstone slices are thinly cut and polished pieces of rock that reveal the inner beauty of crystals and their unique structure of marbled bands. You can display these stunning pieces as decoration, which will also add peaceful and calming energy to a room. Points Or Wands Often used as a healing tool, the shape of points and wands make them excellent energy transmitters. The single and double-terminated quartz adds to its cleansing and purifying properties. Crystals and Astrology Another way to find the best healing stone is with astrology, which uses the movement and position of the planets and stars to determine their influence on your spirit. When you combine this ancient practice with healing crystals, you'll be able to find the perfect stones for spiritual transformation. For example, Moonstone resonates with the natural rhythm of the cancer sign. Find the best crystals for your sign and what they mean in our Crystals and Astrology blog section. CRYSTALS BY INTENTION When choosing a crystal, be thoughtful about your intention, which will help lead you to the perfect stone that you need in that particular moment. By focusing on your needs, you can find the best stone that resonates with certain feelings and emotions.

INTENTIONS AND THE MEANING OF NUMBERS After working with crystals for nearly 30 years, we have found that understanding the meaning of numbers can also increase the power of your intentions. For example, saying your intention once signifies new beginnings while repeating it eight times symbolizes wealth and power. From 1 to 10, each number has a meaning, from boosting harmony to encouraging action. You can learn more about numbers and what they represent in the Crystal Muse book, which goes into more depth.
