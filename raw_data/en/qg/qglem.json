INTRODUCTION The use of peri -operative antimicrobials has become an essential component of the standard of care for certain surgical procedures and can result in a reduced risk of post -operative infection when sound and appropriate principles are utilized. However, the benefit of antimicrobial prophylaxis mu st be weighed against the risks of toxic and allergic reactions, emergence of resistant b acteria, drug interactions, super -infection, and cost. III. CONSIDERATIONS FOR ANTIMICROBIAL PROPHYLAXIS Goal: Administer antimicrobial prophylaxis to achieve serum and tissue levels of antimicrobial at the time of incision and for the duration of the operati on, that are in excess of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed for organisms that may be encountered during the procedure . a. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered if there is a risk of infection in the absence of a prophylactic agent; clean procedures rarely require prophylaxis unless high risk procedure, including implantation of prosthetic material. i. Clean procedures are defined as those with no acute inflammation or transection of gastrointestinal, oropharyngeal, g enitourinary, biliary, or respiratory tracts (elective cases, no technique break). b. The activity of the chosen prophylactic agent(s) should encompass the most common pathogens associated with the surgical proc edure and consider local susceptibility data, bu t need not cover every likely pathogen. c. The prophylactic agent must be administered in a dose which provides an effective tissue concentration prior to incision / in tra-operative bacterial contamination. i. In most instances, a single intravenous dose of an antimicrobial agent provides adequate tissue concentrations around the time of anesthesia induction and throughout the operation. 1. Antimicrobial agent infusion should begin 15 -60 minutes before the incision with the exception of vancomycin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, azithromycin and fluconazole. These infusions should begin 45-90 minutes before the incision and infused over 60 -120 minutes as indicated for adults and pediatrics (See following tables ). 2. In adult patients, cefazolin (2 g if <120 kg, 3 g if 120 kg) and vancomycin (1 g if <80 kg, 1.5 g if 80 kg) dosing is based on weight. Adult patients <50 kg should refer to Patients <50 kg (Adult and Pediatric) Dosing rec ommendations for dosing. Weight -based dosing is recommended for all an tibiotics in patients <50 kg . 3. Infusion duration and time to redosing for recommended prophylactic antimicrobials are summarized for adults and pediatrics. 4. All prophylactic antimicrobials should be discontinued after the intra -operative period, unless othe rwise specified. a. Data have not supported subsequent doses after surgical closure and may increase the risk of Clostr idium difficile and antimicrobial resistance. b. A longer duration of antimicrobials may be indicated, if concomitant infection is present at the time of surgery.

FOOTNOTES 2 Low-risk allergies include: pruritus without rash, remote (>10 years) unknown reaction, patient denies allergy but is on record, mild /severe rash with no other symptoms ( see exceptions in 'severe non-IgE reactions below ), urticaria/hives with no other symptomsSee -lactam allergy evaluation and empiric guidance for further information. 3 High -risk allergies include: respiratory symptoms, angioedema, cardiovascular symptomssyncope/passing out, arrhythmia), anaphylaxis. If a patient has a high -risk allergy to penicillins, they may receive cefazolin, cefoxitin, or cefuroxime. . See -lactam allergy evaluation and empiric guidance for further information. 4 Severe non -IgE reactions that are contraindications to further beta -lactam use ( except aztreonam, which can be used unless the reaction was to ceftazidime or cefiderocol ) unless approved by Allergy: organ damage (kidney, liver), drug -induced immune -mediated anemia/thrombocytopenia/leukopenia, rash with muc osal lesions (Stevens Necrosis), rash with pustules (acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis), rash with eosinophils and organ injury (DRESS - drug rash eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), rash with joint pain, fever, a nd myalgia (Serum Sickness). See -lactam allergy evaluation and empiric guidance for further information. 5 Beta -lactam antibiotics include the following antibiotic classes: penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, aztreonam Refer to Pre -op and Intraoperative Antibiotic Dosing Recommendations Guidelines Guideline includes infusion duration and t ime to int ra-operative redosing All prophylactic antimicrobials should be discontinued after the intra -operative period, unless otherwise specified Adult patients <50 kg should receive antibiotic dosing based on 50 kg guideline Pediatrics patients >50 kg should rec eive antibiotic dosing based on >50 kg guideline Use mg/kg dosing for patients <5 kg SIP operative pediatrics procedures include: cardiac, ventriculoperitoneal shunts, and spinal surgery * Redosing should occur with the same initial dose, with the exception of cefazolin and clindamycin when used in cardiac/SBE pr ophylaxis ** SBE prophylaxis, ACC/AHA 2008 guideline update on valvular heart disease Adapted from Clinical Infectious Diseases 2004;38:1706 -15 and Am J Health -Syst Pharm 2013;70. Reconstituted dose injected directly into vein or via running IV fluids (only if IV piggyback not available). Intermittent IV infusion. Gentamicin dose should be based on ideal body weight unless actual body weight is less than ideal body weight. Use alternative to gentamicin in adult patients if SCr 2 mg/dL or CrCL mL/min, unless otherwise specified . Daptomycin should be dosed on actual body weigh t except in patients with BMI 35 kg/m2, in which case adjusted body weight should be used. Infusion Timing: Infusions should begin 15 -60 minutes prior to incisi on for all antimicrobial agents unless listed ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, hromycin, and fluconazole, should 45 -90 minutes prior to incision . If pre-operative antibiotics have already been administered but incision has been delayed more than 60 minutes beyond th e maximum dosing window (i .e., beta -lactam antibiotics started >2 hours prior to incision), consider pre -operative re -dosing for all antibiotics except vancomycin and aminoglycosides. For vancomycin and aminoglycosides, please contact pharmacy to determine if re-dosing is appropriate. Patients receiving systemic antibiotics prior to procedure should still receive the standard pre -operative antimicrobial prophylaxis with appropriate timing of administration as outlined in the UMHS surgical antimicrobia l prophylaxis guidelines. Given the risk of nephrotoxicity, in patients receiving vancomycin or aminoglycosides prior to proc edure who need these agents for pre -operative antimicrobial prophylaxis, please consult pharmacy to see if treatment doses can be r escheduled such that administration begins 45 -90 minutes prior to incision. In patients with known colonization or infection with drug -resistant pathogens, the standard pre -operative antimicrobial prophylaxis should generally still be administered unl ess otherwise specified in procedure -specific guidelines. Please contact the ID approval pager (adults: 30780; pediatrics: 36149) to discuss the case if history of a multidrug -resistant organism (e.g. , ESBL - producing organism, carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae, etc.) at the site of the procedure in the previous year OR history of MRSA colonization in the p revious year. Deviations may be appropriate for staged procedures. For example, in TMJ replacement cases ampicillin/sulbactam pr ior to the intra -oral portion of the procedure followed by cefazolin prior to the neck incision.
