Jones, *Monica E. Parise, and Anthony E. Fiore Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia Abstract. Toxoplasma gondii is a leading cause of severe foodborne illness in the United States. Population-based studies have found T. gondii infection to be more prevalent in racial/ethnic minority and socioeconomically dis- advantaged groups. Soil contaminated with cat feces, undercooked meat, and congenital transmission are the principal sources of infection. Toxoplasmosis-associated illnesses include congenital neurologic and ocular disease; acquired immunocompetent persons, most notably ocular disease; and encephalitis or disseminated disease in immunosuppressedpersons. The association of T. gondii infection with risk for mental illness is intriguing and requires further research. Reduction of T. gondii in meat, improvements in hygiene and food prep aration practices, and reduction of environ- mental contamination can prevent toxoplasmosis, but more research is needed on how to implement these measures. In addition, screening and treatment may help prevent toxoplasmosis or reduce the severity of disease in some settings. INTRODUCTION Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the protozoan par- asite Toxoplasma gondii . Cats are the definitive host in which the organism can complete its sexual cycle. Cats usually shed the environmentally resistant oocyst form of the organism in their feces for 1 -2 weeks after a new infection, although in specific situations related to strain types, co-infection with Cystoisospora felis (syn. is possible.1Sporulation is required for oocysts to become infectious and occurs within 1 -5d a y si n the environment. Sporulated oocysts are quite hardy; they can remain infective in a moist environment for a year ormore. 1Once ingested by humans or any other warm-blooded animal, the parasite transforms into a tissue-infective stage in the intestine, migrates through the intestinal wall, and iscarried via the blood to other tissues including the centralnervous system. Humans are accidental hosts and can be infected through a variety of exposures. Food-borne transmission occurs withingestion of raw or undercooked meat containing the parasite in tissue cysts (usually pork, lamb, goat, or wild game meat, although beef and field-raised chickens have been implicatedin epidemiologic studies), 2or through ingestion of food, soil, or water contaminated by cat feces (for example, from eating unwashed fruits and vegetables, gardening, or cleaning a cat'slitter box). Mother-to-child transmission typically occurs whena pregnant woman is newly infected during, or just prior to, her pregnancy. The organism can also be transmitted when a previously uninfected person receives an organ or bloodtransfusion from an infected donor. The proportion of human T. gondii infections acquired by eating meat containing infective cysts versus ingesting oocystsfrom cat feces contamination is not known for a representa- tive sample of the general population. However, ingestion of oocysts from cat feces/soil and ingestion of tissue cysts in meatboth are significant contributors to the disease burden in humans, although oocysts have recently been shown to play an important role. 3-5Modern confinement production hasdecreased T. gondii contamination of meat but there is concern that a new trend in the production of free-range raised animalsfor meat could increase the risk of contamination. 2 Three principal clonal T. gondii genotypes were originally detected, primarily in isolates from the United States and Europe. However, more recently using sequence-based tech-nology 15 haplogroups that define 6 major clades have been described, 6and the new paradigm is that many atypical geno- types differ in pathogenicity and transmissibility from typicalgenotypes. 7Research supports the concept that T. gondii genotype may be related to disease severity.8-10However, there is relatively little information about T. gondii genotypes infecting asymptomatic persons, and in general, the clinical implications of T. gondii strains are incompletely understood. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS A self-limited or mild illness characterized by fever, malaise and lymphadenopathy is often seen after T. gondii infection, but many infections are subclinical. However, regardless ofinitial symptoms, a chronic infection is established, and immunosuppression, such as occurs with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease or use of immunosuppressivemedications in cancer treatment or after organ transplant, can result in disease reactivation and severe morbidity including neurologic involvement, or mortality. In those withadvanced human immunodeficiency virus -related immuno- suppression, encephalitis is a common manifestation unless long-term prophylactic medication is taken. Congenital infection can cause pregnancy loss (miscarriage or stillbirth) or severe disease in the newborn, including developmental delays, blindness, and epilepsy. 11However, many newborns with congenital toxoplasmosis are asymptom-atic at birth. Nevertheless, even if asymptomatic at birth, ill- ness will develop in many infected infants later in their life, most often ocular disease, but also neurologic symptoms anddevelopmental disabilities. 11For example, 82% of congeni- tally infected children (9 of 11, including 4 who received treat- ment) were shown to have ocular lesions by age 20 in onesmall prospective series. 12Other studies confirm the risk for severe illness among congenitally infected children but have found a somewhat lower risk in treated children. For example, in a group of 127 treated children followed-up to 16 years inFrance, ocular lesions were present in 18.9%. 13In another*Address correspondence to Jeffrey L.

However, studies have now revealed asso- ciations between T. gondii antibody seropositivity (indicating infection) and the presence of various psychiatric disorders in humans (e.g., schizophrenia, 16bipolar illness,17suicide attempts,18episodes of self-directed violence,19and memory impairment in elderly persons20). Although these results are intriguing and potentially signal a new and compelling reason to redouble efforts to p revent toxoplasmosis, addi- tional studies are needed to fu lly elucidate the relationship between T. gondii infection and mental illness, and how the strain and stage of T. gondii (oocyst versus tissue cyst) affects this relationship.21 DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT Toxoplasma gondii infection can be diagnosed by testing for antibodies against Toxoplasma ,a sw e l la sb yd i r e c tt e s t - ing or visualization of the parasite in body tissues or fluids.Basic antibody tests (e.g., IgG and IgM) are available com- mercially. Detection of IgG against Toxoplasma indicates previous exposure, but does not indicate when infectionoccurred. Detection of IgM against Toxoplasma is sugges- tive of acute infection, but IgM can persist for months or even years after infection and fals e-positive IgM test results can occur in persons who are chronically infected or not infected with T. gondii . 22Therefore, when clinical action depends on test results, IgM test results should be verifiedat a reference laboratory, especially for pregnant women and newborns. 23Antibody avidity testing can been used to help distinguish between recent and distant infection,24an important consideration for pregnant women when IgM isdetected and the risk for congenital toxoplasmosis is being assessed. Avidity testing is available in many countries including the United States. 25 Treatment recommendations vary with the type and sever- ity of infection. Mild disease in adults with normally func- tioning immune systems rarely requires treatment, whereassevere disease, including disease in immunosuppressed per- sons, requires treatment with a combination of anti-parasitic medications (e.g., pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine). 26,27Clini- cal management of pregnant women and infants with congeni-tal infection is complex and consultation with a specialist is advised.28 PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE OF TOXOPLASMOSIS IN THE UNITED STATES Toxoplasmosis is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Serologic evidence ofinfection is more frequently seen in black and Hispanic per-sons, and among persons who are foreign-born, have low edu-cational levels or socioeconomic status, or have occupationsinvolving exposure to soil. 29,30Serologic evidence of Toxocara (dog or cat roundworm) infection, which is soil-borne, is morecommonly seen among those with T. gondii infection, suggest- ing common risk factors for acquiring the two infections. 31 In the United States, studies examining data from the mid to late 2000s estimated toxoplasmosis to be the secondleading cause of deaths attributable to foodborne illness(an estimated 327 deaths), the fourth leading cause of hos- pitalizations attributable to foodborne illness (an estimated 4,428 hospitalizations), and a leading contributor to loss ofquality-adjusted life years. 32,33Toxoplasma gondii infects an estimated 1.1 million persons each year in the UnitedStates. 34Chorioretinitis caused by infection with T. gondii develops in an estimated 21,000 persons each year, and symp-tomatic chorioretinitis, leading to vision loss, develops in morethan 4,800 of these persons. 34Because symptoms in the eye recur over time and new lesions commonly develop, thesecalculations are likely to be minimum estimations of the inci-dence of symptomatic ocular toxoplasmosis. Ocular toxoplas-mosis creates a significant burden on the healthcare system,with an estimated 250,000 visits to ophthalmologists for activeor chronic disease over a two-year period. 35 Serologic surveys over past decades indicate that rates of infection with T. gondii have decreased in the United States. A study comparing the population-based National Health andNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during 1988 -1994 with the NHANES during 1999 -2004 showed a 36% decrease in the age-adjusted seroprevalence in the more recent study(14.1% to 9.0% in persons 12 -49 years of age). 30Preliminary results from the NHANES 2009-2010 show further decreases (Jones J, unpublished data). Because in the older study (NHANES 1988 -1994) all persons \u00b312 years of age were t e s t e d ,a ne s t i m a t ec o u l db em a d ef o rt h eo v e r a l lp o p u l a t i o n in this age range. The age-adjusted T. gondii antibody sero- prevalence was 22.5%, but there considerable variationby region; the lowest age-adjusted T. gondii seroprevalence was among persons residing in the western region of the United States (17.5%) and highest in the North- east (29.2%). 29 An estimated 400 -4,000 infants are born with congenital toxoplasmosis each year in the United States.36-38Overall, approximately 30% of women who acquire infection duringpregnancy transmit the infection to the fetus; the risk of transmission from mother to ch ild is lowest when infection occurs during the first trimester (10 -15%) and higher as pregnancy progresses to the third trimester (60 -90%). 39 However, injury to the fetus is usually greatest when acute infection occurs early in pregnancy,39although some atypical genotypes can the incidence of congenital infections vary in the United States. The most recently published population-based estimate is derived from the New England Newborn Screening program in the late 1980s and early 1990s, 38,40 a region shown to have the highest prevalence of T. gondii infection in the United States.29Analysis of newborn IgM blood spot screening tests in Massachusetts and New Hampshire yielded an estimate of 1 case per 12,212 live births.40More recent data from the New England Newborn Screening Program showed that congenital toxoplasmosis rates during 2000 -2010 ranged from approximately 1.3 to 6.8 per 100,000 live births (Eaton R, unpublished data).Newborn screening filter paper blood spot IgM test sensitiv- ity is low (approximately 50 -75%). 41-43In addition, because false-positive IgM test results also occur, serum samples fromthe mother and infant must be followed-up to verify truepositive test results. 40Older local studies in the United States found congenital toxoplasmosis rates of approximately 1 per 1,000 newborns.44,45Similar to seroprevalence estimates among adults, rates of congenital infection are likely to vary by region of the United States. PREVENTION STRATEGIES The devastating impact of congenital infection has led to great interest in reducing risk through screening. In one eco- nomic analysis, an approach comprised of monthly prenatal T. gondii screening and treatment of women infected in preg- nancy coupled with one year of treatment of infected new- borns with pyrimethamine and sulfonamides was estimated to be cost saving if the rate of congenital infection wasgreater than 1 per 10,000 live births. 46However, the cost savings were based on an ideal program with all prenatal visits conducted on time, all tests validated at a highly expert reference laboratory, and when required, treatmentgiven soon after maternal seroconversion. The efficacy of treatment of pregnant women and infants has not been determined by well-controlled randomized trials, either forthe ability to prevent congenital infection or reduce sequlae in infected infants. Treatment is thought to be most effec- tive if given within days to weeks of seroconversion in preg-nant women. Even in France, where routine screening has been recommended for decades, a study found late initial testing and poor compliance with recommended screeningintervals (the first test was performed later than the recom-mended first 12 weeks of pregnancy in 25% of women, and only 40% of women had the recommended number of screening tests in pregnancy). 47In Austria, where prenatal screening every trimester has been recommended and con- ducted for three decades, only 30% of seronegative women were found to be tested at least three times during theirpregnancies. 48These findings imply that in a real-world setting it can be challenging to screen and treat newly sero- converted pregnant women s oon after infection. Neverthe- less, the societal and economic costs of care for developmental disabilities such as congenital toxoplasmosis, estimated to be from approximately 500,000 to 3.3 million U.S. dollarsper case according to the severity, 46are considerable for symptomatic cases. Although there has been so me enthusiasm within the medical community for prenatal or neonatal screeningprograms, others, including the United Kingdom NationalScreening Committee, have argued that there is currently no evidence from randomized placebo-controlled trials demon-strating efficacy for screening and treatment of toxoplasmosis. 49-51In recent years, prenatal or neonatal toxo- plasmosis screening has been evaluated but not adopted innumerous countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom,Switzerland, and Denmark 50-53; and in Canada and Israel.54,55 Screening in these countries was not adopted because of a low incidence of T. gondii infection (similar to that of the United States), concerns about the lack of well-controlled studies documenting benefit, and concerns about potential costs and harms of the programs outweighing benefits in apractical setting. In addition, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists did not recommend univer- sal screening of pregnant women for T. gondii infection in their practice guidelines. 56Studies and systematic reviews have yielded conflicting results on the benefits of prenatal screening and treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis.57-66 There is a need for well controlled studies to help determine the effectiveness these interventions. Preventing infection of pregnant women through educa- tion is another potentially beneficial strategy. A study ofpregnant women in the United States found that they often lack knowledge about how to prevent T. gondii infection, especially the risks associated with eating or handling rawor undercooked meat. 67Although numerous studies have provided some evidence that education of pregnant women may be beneficial,68-72one review of toxoplasmosis-related health education called for more rigorously designed researchon prevention of toxoplasmosis through education, and questioned the validity of results from published studies. 73 In addition, a recent Cochrane systematic review found very little rigorous scientific evidence that prenatal education is effective in reducing congenital toxoplasmosis and called for randomized controlled trials to confirm the potential benefitsand quantify the impact of educational interventions. 74 Vaccination of cats for toxoplasmosis has also been pro- posed as a control method and an oral live vaccine preventedcats from shedding oocysts in clinical trials. 75However, the commercial production of toxoplasmosis vaccine for cats was discontinued because of its high cost, the need to keep the vaccine frozen, its short shelf life, and lack of interestamong cat owners. 1A live toxoplasmosis vaccine for sheep that produces protective immunity for 18 months is avail- able in some countries (but not in the United States) toreduce loss of lambs. 76Vaccination with killed T. gondii preparations has been unsu ccessful. For humans, develop- ment of a live mutant or avirulent strain vaccine has notbeen pursued because these strains may pose a risk to the fetus and there is insufficien t data on the risk of reversion toT. gondii strains that could cause disease, particularly in immunosuppressed persons. GAPS IN CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND PROGRAMATIC INTERVENTIONS Despite limited data on the incidence and prevalence of infection and illness caused by T. gondii , toxoplasmosis is clearly an important public health problem in the United States and globally. Much remains to be learned about toxo- plasmosis to improve our knowledge of the disease, as well asto decrease infection rates through prevention and treatment.796 JONES AND OTHERSFurther insight into the number of children infected by mother-to-child transmission could be gained by conductinga pilot prenatal screening and treatment program with active surveillance for congenital toxoplasmosis. However, the ben- efits of treatment remain uncertain and treatment trials withplacebo treatment groups mi ght be problematic from an ethical standpoint. In addition, because the congenital toxo- plasmosis rate is low in the United States, appropriately controlled studies of treatment efficacy would require mil-lions of study participants and be extremely expensive. Given these limitations, a monitored pilot evaluation of pre- natal screening and treatment in a high-risk country or geo-graphic region may be the best practical option, even if only a subset of the population undergoing prenatal screening is monitored for outcomes (e.g., randomly selected healthcarefacilities, or sentinel sites). There are numerous potential T. gondii maternal screening program pitfalls that include: lack of confirmation of positive screening test results before taking clinical actions, such asamniocentesis to assess fetal infection or implementing treatment; risk of amniocentesis to verify fetal infection; 77,78 and late initial testing and poor compliance with screening intervals that lead to delayed initiation of therapy, as has been a problem in France and Austria.47,48,79Because routine prenatal T. gondii infection screening would be new in low- incidence countries such as the United States, and the practi- calities of its implementation in such countries are unknown, assessments of such screening and treatment programs shouldinclude 1) the proportion of T. gondii testing in pregnancy performed at correct intervals, and 2) the appropriate use of reference laboratories to validate test results, 3) evaluation of elective pregnancy terminations in women who show positivetest results but who have not had their tests results confirmed, 4) the outcome and side effects of amniocentesis used to verify fetal infection, 5) the side effects of medications usedin pregnant women and infants, 6) the time after maternal seroconversion that treatment is initiated, 7) the regimen used for treatment, 8) patient compliance with the treatment,9) the outcome in infants, and 10) the costs and benefits. Inthe United States, if large numbers of tests were performed for screening, it is not certain that confirmatory testing could be limited to one expert reference laboratory, or even to severalcommercial laboratories, and in the past T. gondii tests at some commercial laboratories have not been accurate. 22 The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis can be difficult, especially in immunosuppressed patients and in persons with congenital disease. Diagnostic tools for toxoplasmosis, including poly- merase chain reaction, more sensitive and specific IgM tests,Western blots for comparison of maternal and infant antibody response, and strain typing tests, would benefit from further development. 11,80 -82In addition, relatively little is known regarding treatment efficacy for ocular disease.83,84Improve- ments in treatment could pot entially be achieved through 1) trials to establish the efficacy for preventing congenital transmission and sequlae in infants, as well as the optimalmedications and duration of therapy; and 2) collaboration with those in the ophthalmologic community to improve detec- tion and treatment of ocular disease and to create standard-ized, evidence-based practices for ocular disease designed to minimize morbidity and to prevent recurrent disease. The reduction in prevalence of T. gondii infection in the United States suggests that efforts to improve quality controlby meat producers and improved cat-care hygiene, as well as efforts to increase knowledge about toxoplasmosis amongphysicians and the public, have been successful in reducing toxoplasmosis risk. 30Further reductions in infection could be achieved through identification and mitigation of risk factorsforT. gondii infection, including 1) encouraging good produc- tion practices by meat producers, 2) developing methods to minimize environmental contamination of soil and water with T. gondii , and 3) improving patient education and public health messages to reduce ingestion of undercooked meat and improve cat feces -related and soil-related hygiene. 67,85,86 Further understanding of the impact of toxoplasmosis on health, including mental health, is needed to help keep public health resources focused on prevention efforts. Continued evaluation of T. gondii infection using population-based stud- ies to monitor the prevalence and temporal trends in infectionwill be essential to measure the impact of prevention efforts and guide adjustments in prevention strategies.
