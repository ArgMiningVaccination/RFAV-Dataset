[According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/ibd/features/IBD-more-chronic-diseases.html), approximately 3.1 million adults in the United States live with IBD. Of these, some face malnutrition, with diarrhea, cramps, and fatigue, or malabsorption, making it difficult to enjoy meals or maintain a healthy diet. Many people look to herbs and over-the-counter supplements to help alleviate Crohn's symptoms. When you seek out dietary supplements and herbal remedies for [Crohn's disease](https://www.everydayhealth.com/crohns-disease/guide/), it's crucial to remember that such supplements are not regulated by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/), so it's best to speak to your [gastroenterologist](/digestive-health/what-is-a-gastroenterologist-and-what-do-they-treat/) or dietitian before trying anything new. \"I think the most important thing is for people to take whatever medications their doctor prescribes them and have any supplements be secondary,\" says [Meira Abramowitz, MD](https://weillcornell.org/mabramowitz), a gastroenterologist at the Jill Roberts Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. Dr. Abramowitz stressed the importance of consulting your doctor before taking any supplements. \"Since supplements aren't regulated, I'm against patients just randomly using them from the health-food store,\" she says. \"Some could cause liver toxicity or result in other adverse health issues.\" But recent studies show promising results for using herbs to treat Crohn's symptoms. Abramowitz says that some studies have concluded that herbs like wormwood are safe to take. \"They can help with intestinal inflammation, but still more research needs to be done,\" she adds. Herbal Supplements and Crohn's Disease: What the Research Says A [review published in January 2015 in the Journal of Crohn's and Colitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518050) examined various alternative therapies for inflammatory bowel diseases, including herbal remedies, [acupuncture](/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/), mindfulness training, and [hypnotherapy](/integrative-health/hypnotherapy/guide/). The researchers looked at 29 professional trials of herbal remedies for Crohn's disease and [ulcerative colitis](https://www.everydayhealth.com/ulcerative-colitis/guide/) (UC), another form of IBD, and found that the herbal therapies seemed to offer some of the best evidence of good results. The herb wormwood was shown to be the most effective for Crohn's disease. This bitter herb is often prepared with a distillation of neutral alcohol along with spices, water, and other herbs. It can be ingested as a tea, a tincture, or in a capsule. The review found that study participants who were treated with wormwood in addition to standard treatment for IBD experienced fewer symptoms and more quality-of-life improvements than those treated with Crohn's medication alone. In addition to wormwood, herbal remedies that may help improve Crohn's disease symptoms include: - Tripterygium wildfordii Hook F This traditional Chinese drug, also called TwHF, is widely used to help treat Crohn's disease in China. A [2015 randomized controlled trial published in](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26473333/) [The American Journal of Medical Sciences](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26473333/)looked at its effect in 137 Crohn's patients. After a year of use, those treated with high-dose TwHF in addition to standard Crohn's medication were less likely to have symptom recurrence than those treated with low-dose TwHF and standard therapy or standard therapy alone. - Chios mastic gum The resin produced by the Chios mastic tree on the Greek island of Chios possesses a large number of antioxidant substances. The gooey material is repurposed into gum for consumption. According to a report [published in 2015 in the](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367210/) [Annals of Gastroenterology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367210/), small studies have shown that mastic gum may help relieve symptoms of Crohn's disease. But the authors caution that larger, more robust studies are needed to determine its effect. Can Medical Marijuana Help With Crohn's Symptoms? With [medical marijuana](/marijuana/) now legal in a growing number of states, there's been increased interest in the potential of cannabis to help treat Crohn's disease. Many with the condition already turn to marijuana, with surveys showing between 6.8 and 17.6 percent of people with IBD actively use cannabis, according to a [2019 review published in the journal ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6727090/) [Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6727090/). The researchers concluded that in small studies, using marijuana has been associated with decreased symptoms of IBD, including [abdominal pain](/abdominal-pain/guide/), cramping, and diarrhea. However, there is currently no scientific evidence that medical marijuana can reduce inflammation associated with IBD or that it improves disease activity. The [Crohn's & Colitis Foundation](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/complementary-medicine/medical-cannabis) cautions that more research is needed (and is ongoing) into the impact of marijuana on IBD. The organization also warns of the potential side effects of cannabis use, including severe nausea and vomiting, difficulty thinking and concentrating, impaired short-term memory, altered judgment, anxiety, and changes in mood. Using marijuana while pregnant may also lead to health issues in newborns, including low birth weight, according to the CDC. If you use cannabis or are thinking of using cannabis for your IBD, it's important to discuss this with your doctor. Nutritional Supplements and Crohn's Disease Some nutritional supplements can be effective for Crohn's, too. A [study published in February 2015 in the ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2050640615572176) [United European Gastroenterology Journal](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2050640615572176) found that supplements containing [vitamin D](https://www.everydayhealth.com/vitamin-d/) could alleviate the intestinal barrier dysfunction that plagues many people with the disease. [Vitamin D](/drugs/vitamin-d) is also crucial for bone formation. Other supplements to consider include: - B vitamins Many people with Crohn's have B12 deficiency, which can be linked to [anemia](https://www.everydayhealth.com/anemia/anemia-basics.aspx). Abramowitz recommends taking B12 supplements to fight off weakness and fatigue. Iron supplements might also be recommended if your doctor notes a deficiency. - Potassium and magnesium Magnesium and [potassium](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pictures/foods-high-in-potassium/)supplements can help with vomiting and nausea, as well as complications that come from chronic diarrhea.
