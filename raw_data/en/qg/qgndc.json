All emotions cause a chemical reaction in the body, like for example when you are sad, chemicals go off and you cry, or when you are in love chemicals go off and your stomach feels nervous or your reproductive areas get extra circulation. This is true, even if the emotions were first experienced when you were a child. The subconscious mind stores these emotions and may still be reacting to them, without you consciously knowing it. Experiences that have happened in our lives can be affecting our bodily functions, like metabolism (can't lose weight no matter how you eat) or unexplained recurrent miscarriage. The examples are infinite, because each person is so different. Even if you can't remember what the situation was or when it happened. Mind-body therapies can help to clear those blockages that may be having an effect on your fertility. There are many different mind-body therapies that you can explore, but how do you know if you should even try a mind-body therapy for fertility? - You are experiencing stress - Unexplained infertility - You have some unresolved emotional issues - You have had some issues with getting pregnant, but everything is physically fine - You experience fear or depression about becoming a mother even though you want to - You want a more enjoyable fertility journey There are many more examples, and there doesn't really need to be a \"problem\" to use mind-body therapies, but if there is they can help tremendously. Mind+Body Connections to Boost Your Fertility Naturally... If you are having difficulty conceiving, stress may very well be a factor. If you have had fertility tests performed and have found that there is no medical reason for your infertility, it is time to evaluate your life and determine how much stress you have. Of course, you may not even have need for an evaluation. You may know you are stressed. In that case, it is time to start defeating that stress to help your fertility. Visualization Circle + Bloom is a program based on medical and scientific research proving the negative effects stress has on fertility. It also encompasses a proven method to create a mind + body connection to bring about real changes in the body. This program is over six hours of audio programming, segmented into daily tracks that follow your body's natural fluctuations associated with the reproductive cycle. Each daily session is approximately 15 minutes of a unique combination of music, words, and guided instructions, designed to help your body manage stress and understand what it needs to do to get ready for conception. It is simple to use, each day you listen to the session that matches where you are in your cycle. You can start at any point in your cycle and repeat or delete sessions if your cycle is longer or shorter than 28 days. Who Can Benefit from Circle + Bloom... The program is for any woman who is trying to get pregnant. Circle + Bloom was designed to reduce the anxiety and stress associated with trying to get pregnant. In addition, the comprehensive guided visualization method used in the program has shown in studies to cause physical changes in a person's body. Therefore, the program could help women with unexplained infertility, PCOS, or a specific physical condition. Joanne Verkuilen founder of Circle + Bloom shares, \"Recent studies, such as one by Emory University's Dr. Sarah Berga, explains that the hypothalamus (a walnut-sized part of the brain that's known to regulate stress hormones) acts as our reproductive system's \"master of ceremonies\". Her important research is starting to show us how delicate our hormonal balance is and how stress hormones could be impacting our reproductive systems.\" You can use the program alone or you can use it to help improve your chances of conception if you are doing an ART, or require other medical procedures. In a nutshell, Circle + Bloom can help to optimize your body and mind to increase your chances of success with a variety of issues and a variety of fertility approaches. EFT - Emotional Freedom Technique The theory behind this technique is that all negative emotions are caused by a disruption in the body's energy system. Therefore, by balancing the energy via the same system as used in acupuncture (the meridians), negative emotions are resolved which, in turn, can mean a change is brought about in the physiological condition of a person hopefully helping her to conceive. The release of emotions such as fear, worry, and sadness gives way to rational and logical thinking. It can also generate feelings of great relief and lightness. This technique is great for those who have unexplained infertility or are experiencing a lot of stress on their fertility journey. It is one of the many infertility tools that are available to people who are having trouble conceiving. This technique is wonderful because it addresses both fertility and stress reduction at the same time. While the practitioners cannot guarantee conception, EFT has no known negative side effects and the reported success rates for resolving both emotional and physical issues is amazingly high with improvement for up to 95% of people. It is a relatively cheap or free technique that can be applied by a practitioner or on oneself. This technique is promoted by a number of natural health advocates like Deepak Chopra and Dr. Mercola. The easiest way to learn how to perform EFT for fertility would be to learn the techniques found in the [Overcoming Infertility with EFT eBook](http://www.naturalfertilityshop.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=EFTBOOK). Meditation Meditation is a great mind-body technique to use alone or in conjunction with any of the mentioned therapies. Actually, all of these can be done together (that would actually be very powerful! and speed up the results) Meditation helps to clear the mind of excess thoughts and chatter. Once you have a clear mind, you feel peace and surrender to life's current circumstances. Meditation can help to make your conception journey enjoyable and peaceful, regardless of what happens.

NLP - Neuro Linguistic Programming Neuro Linguistic Programming is based on the idea that mind, body and language interact to create an individual's perception of the world and those perceptions, and hence behaviors, can be changed by the application of a variety of techniques. Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a behavioral technology, which simply means that it is a set of guiding principles, attitudes, and techniques about real-life behavior, and not a removed, scientific theorem. It allows you to change, adopt, or eliminate behaviors, as you desire, and gives you the ability to choose your mental, emotional, and physical states of well-being. I have personally seen an NLP practitioner and felt a lasting change from the technique. To learn more about NLP visit: http://www.anlp.org/ Hypnotherapy Hypnotherapy is amazing. The effects are powerful and it is easy to self-apply or you can go see a hypnotherapist. Hypnotherapy speaks to your subconscious mind and programs it with whatever your goals are. Applying hypnotherapy for fertility is very effective if done consistently. You can listen to self-hypnosis CDs every night until you get pregnant as part of a complete fertility program or by itself. I personally find the Circle+Bloom program to be the best Mind+Body program to date. I have been trained in Hypnobabies, hypnosis for a pain free childbirth, and it is absolutely amazing watching women in labor, with no drugs and no pain, give birth naturally and painlessly. Therapy Seeking therapy is another mind-body therapy that can be useful to remove blockages that may be affecting your fertility. Having someone listen to you is very therapeutic. Professor Berga shared at the 2006 European fertility conference in Prague of a [study showed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5098454.stm) that of the women who received therapy, 75% began ovulating again. Of the group that received no therapy, 25% started to ovulate again. These were high strung women whose stress levels were so high, they stopped ovulating. There are many factors but I think stress affecting fertility is a lot more common than we realize.
