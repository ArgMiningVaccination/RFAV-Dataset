Biden, Jr. issued Executive Order (EO) 14017 on America's Supply Chains to help the United States ensure its prosperity, public health, and national security.i As we approach the one -year anniversary of the issuance of this order, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is proud to report what it has done to help make our public health supply chains and biological preparedness industrial base more resilient, diverse, and secure. This report identifies the successes and practical strategies that HHS is implementing to further the U.S. Government's goals for America's public health supply chain and industrial base . This report explores the public health supply chain and industrial ba se's vulner abilities. It outlines HHS's existing and growing role and ongoing activities to strengthen the public health supply chain and industrial base and the importance of partnering with external stakeholders. It addresses personal protective equipment ( PPE) and durable medical equipment ( DME ), testing and diagnostics, and pharmaceuticals \u2014including therapeutics , vaccines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) ; describes the status of these supply chains and industrial bases ; and explains HHS's current and planned actions to address challenges. In 2022 and beyond, HHS will take additional decisive actions to strengthen the U.S. public health supply chain and industrial base to address evolving coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) challenges and to prepare fo r future public health emergencies and complex public health challenges. This report highlights planned and future actions the U.S. Government can take to further protect the public health supply chain. This report relies and builds on the follo wing U.S. G overnment analyses , which are all a part of the Biden Administration's ongoing efforts to build and sustain U.S. preparedness and response capabilities for future pandemics: National Strategy for a Resilient Public Health Supply Chain (the National Strategy ) American Pandemic Preparedness Plan: Transforming Our Capabilities Building Resilient Supply Chains, Revitalizing American Manufacturing, and Fostering Broad- Based Growth (the 100- Day Report) D efinitions A supply chain is the means for providing supplies and equipment to end- users . The public health supply chain system produces and delivers medical supplies to support the healthcare and public health (HPH) sector and includes both domestic and international suppliers and manufacturers. It provides PPE, DME , diagnostics, other medical devices , and pharmaceuticals (therapeutics and vaccines ) to the American people.ii The public health supply chain and industrial base are primarily within the purview of the private sector . However, t he U.S. Government has a role to play to ensure the foundations of our market economy provide for resilient and transparent supply chains , which are critical to the economic prosperity and national security of the United States . In addition, the U.S. Government has a continued interest in ensuring needed supplies are available to address the current COVID -19 pandemic , future 5 Introduction public heal th emergencies , and its internal needs.1 1 For example , the National Inst itutes of Health 's (NIH) Clinical Center is the nation's largest hospital devoted entirely to clinical research and therefore is an important government consumer of products from the public health supply chain and industrial base.

The public health supply chain is , therefore, of great 2 2 MCMs include both pharmaceutical interventions ( e.g., vaccines, antimicrobials, antidotes, and antitoxins) and non-pharmaceutical interventions ( e.g., medical devices \u2014including diagnostics \u2014ventilators, personal protective equipment, and patient decontamination) as well as other needed medical products that may be used to prevent, mitigate, or treat the adverse health effects of an in tentional, accidental, or naturally occurring public health emergency. They include , but are not limited to , qualified countermeasures as defined in section 319F -1(a)(2) of the including medical devices, medical equipment, pharmaceutical products, and other products designed to improve patient outcomes . The PHIB also includes associated workforces, including research and development facilities, which help produc e essential medicinesimportance to the U.S. Government. The public health industrial base (PHI B) includes all entities manufacturing or producing medical products and medical counte rmeasures (MCMs) 3, MCMs, and critical inputs for the HPH sector. It does not include the ability of distributors to source medical products from foreign sources t o distribute within the U.S. healthcare system. Unlike the defense industrial base,4 the PHIB is driven by the private market, which creates unique challenges, such as incentivizing domestic industry to maintain capacity which might be less economical than foreign competitors. S upport to the Supply Chain and Industrial Base During the COVID-19 Pandemic HHS took decisive actions to address the COVID -19 pandemic . HHS is supporting the public health supply chain and the PHIB and providing crucial assistance to frontline workers and the American people . In 2021: 6 Introduction HHS allocated $76 B in COVID -19 emergency supplemental funding , including investing $3B to accelerate production of rapid tests, expand production capacity, and lead the Administration's procurement of 500 million over -the-counter COVID -19 diagnostic tests; $250M in PPE manufacturing; $65M in vaccine vial manufacturing . Since the beginning of the COVID -19 response in 2020, the Strategic National Stockpile ( SNS) has utilized approximately $12B from COVID -19 supplemental appropriations to acquire approximately 747 million N95 respirators (59 t imes pre -pandemic levels); 274 million surgical and procedure face masks (8.5 times pre -pandemic levels); 19.6 million face shields (two times pre -pandemic levels); 59.6 million gowns and coveralls (12.5 times pre -pandemic levels); 4 billion gloves (240 ti mes pre -pandemic levels); 158,000 ventilators (10 times pre -pandemic levels).5 rate as of December 29, 2021 . HH S has strengthened capabilities to monitor and manage supply chain bottlenecks by issuing 66 priority ratings under the Defense Production Act6 6 Section 101 of the DPA authorizes the President to require acceptance and priority performance o f contracts or orders and to allocate mater ials, services, and facilities to promote the national defense or to maximize domestic energy supplies. The President's priorities and allocations authority is delegated, in E.O. 13603, to the Departments of Agric ulture, Energy, Health and Human Services, Transportation, Defense, and Commerce (referred to as \"Resource Departments\") with respect to resources within each department's jurisdiction, accessed January 26, 2022. (DPA ) for U.S. Government cont racts for health resources, eight priority ratings for industrial expansion, three priority ratings for non- U.S. Government contracts to support the production of resins for diagnostics and infusion pumps, and the manufacture of cl osed suction catheters fo r treatment of patients with COVID -19. These ratings allow the U.S. Government to ensure priority is given to urgently needed items, helping to prevent supply bottlenecks from halting production of needed goods. As a result of all these actions, it was possible to administer 600 million COVID -19 vaccines doses and provide 78.4 percent of the U.S. populatio n ( ages 5+) at least one dose of a COVID -19 vaccine as of the beginning of January 2022;iii dona te and deliver 327.5 million vacc ines to other nations ;iv procu re 30 million treatment courses, distribute over 3.3 million monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) doses and 182 million diagnostics kits, and administer 2.9 million treatment courses ; ship over 40 million rapid antigen tests and 2.3 million point -of-care polymeras e chain reaction tests to the most vulnerable populations, including nursing homes, federally qualified healt h c enters, and long -term care facilities since May 2021 ; place 1.5 billion doses of va ccine under contract and award contracts for 78 MCM projects to aid the COVID -19 response, including 16 therapeutics, 55 diagnostics, and seven vaccine candidates .7 Introduction S upply Chain Vulnerabilities The COVID -19 pandemic drastically reduced international travel and trade. Lockdowns also forced workers in the U nited States and beyond to stay home as part of the pandemic response, greatly decreasing the extraction and production of raw materials crucial for items such as PPE and vaccines. Social distancing practices \u2014due to labor shortages and/or limitations on onsite personnel capacity \u2014also reduced the speed at which raw materials could be converted into finished goods. The COVID -19 pandemic has strained global supply chains and exposed critical vulnerabilities in the N ation's ability to de liver effective health care during times of high demand. Offshore manufacturing and just -in- time inventory management , combined with the increased demands of the pandem ic, have stretched the PHIB 's supply chains beyond their capacities and created shortages, resulting in significant disruption for manufacturers and consumers. Although the U.S. Government has made great strides in addressing these vulnerabilities, challen ges remain. T he U.S. Government needs to help create adequate domestic stockpiles and ca pable domestic suppliers with surge capacity. The first step towards doing this is to identify vulnerabilities within the public health supply chain. Factors contributing to the insecur ity of public health supply chains include: Foreign Dependencies: The United States relies on foreign sources for components of its public health supplies . This can affect patient outcomes in the United States whether or not there is an ongoing p ublic health emergency and limits the Nation's ability to implement prevention st rategies that help maintain crucial operations . In addition: Foreign reliance puts the U.S. public health supply chain at risk of disruptions from logistic al challenges , such as s hipping and regulatory delays as well as port congestion. This can lead to production shortages when coupled with increased demand and just-in-time delivery processes . v Fore ign labor shortages due to the COVID -19 pandemic, shifting demographics , natural disasters, conflicts, government regulations, or other or igins can also disrupt supply chains. Ethical considerations , such as avoiding the products of forced labor, can limit the overa ll num ber of suppliers. Single source supplier s exacerbate foreign dependency challenges . Due in part to inconsistent international standards, it ma y be difficult to find sources of some medical -grade components that comply with FDA requirements. These challenges may lead to the sourcing of many medical -grade components solely from one country of origin. As a result, s ource material in the countr y of origin may become difficult to obtain, especially when national interests are prioritized, such as during increased demand periods , a localized event that disrupts the supply chain, or a public health emergency . Foreign sourc ing makes the United State s vul nerable to other countries' export restrictions and other trade -restrictive measures . Such measures can disrupt the supply of critical public health supplies , thereby posing a risk to national health security. Product constraints have been exacerbated by limited access to raw materials produce d o verseas and shortages of subcomponents, like aluminum capacitors, which directly impact the medical device industry .8 Introduction Economic Pressures : Competition for economies of scale7 7 \"Economies of scale exist when increased size of production capacity results in lowe r unity costs ,\" Daniel J. Alesch and L. A. Dougharty , Economie s-of-Scale Analysis in State and Local Government , accessed February 10, 2022. and the lowest available cost have contrib uted to offshoring production of many raw materials and finished products , reduc ing diversity across the supply chain. Companies operating overseas can often outcompete companies with U.S.-based production because of lower overhead costs, fewer regulatory requirements , and lower taxes . These advantages help expand foreign companies' market share, leading to further consolidation through sole source manufacturing . Foreign anticompetitive practices - such as state subsidies to businesses and labor, price fixing, or state -ownership of raw materials - provide further economic advantages to foreign locations over U.S. locations. T he consolidation of the global container shipping industry into a sma ll nu mber of dominant foreign- owned lines and alliances can disadv antage U.S. exporters. Consumers , both individuals and wholesale purchasers, prefer low- cost goods , which are often foreign made, as opposed to more expensive good s produced domestically. This preference may cause existing suppliers to halt operations and new suppliers to lose interest in entering the domestic market. Industry emphasis on cost -cutting has led to a large -scale accept ance of just -in-time inventory management , which leads to limited stock on hand to help withstand disruptions. Unpredictable fluctuations in demand stress supply chains ' financial stability and reduce manufacturers' willingness to scale up production for peak demand periods. To be resilient and m anage the demand fluctuation, a supply chain needs to balance a push- and- pull strategy.8 8 Push -based supply chains ship products from the manufacturing site to retailers based on anticipated demand. Pull- based supply chains are demand- driven rather than prediction -based , accessed February 10, 2022. National Strategy for a Resilient Public Health Supply Chain,Wor kforce Challenges : Challenges filling entry -level and non- entry level positions and heightened training needs , resulting from lengthy machine operating training and certification requirements , increase the risk of suboptimal production and capacity f or some public health supplies. Difficult jobs with poor working conditions contribute to high turnover and prolonged job openings . When coupled with port congestion , this creates problems with receiving product s from overseas manufacturers . Insufficient production supplies , prolonged job openings, absences due to illness , or a lack of technical skills can cause downstream delays of materials and ultimately production scarcity, leading to systemic disruptions.vi COVID -19 has also affected workers through pol icies related to onsite personnel capacity, vaccine mandates, and conditions for returning to work. Barriers to Entry and Expansion: For some U.S. companies, complex and expensive startup costs, including those associated with infrastructure and lengthy regulatory and appr oval processes, are challenges to building or expanding manufacturing capabilities. Some manufacturers face reduced incentive s to upgrade equipment, improv e supply chains , or expand capacity ,vii which contributes to dependency on a limited group of suppliers. Critical domestic environmental protections that safeguard public health and welfare, including the health and welfare of communities adjacent to manufacturing facilities, do not always exist in foreign supply chains. Subpar environmental and public health protections result in lower production costs that allow offshore competitors to undercut U.S. products. 9 Introduction FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Draft/Pre -decisional In addition, equipment for capital expan sion of pr oductio n lines i s often produce d over seas, which complicates rapid indu strial e xpansion. Lack of Visi bility a nd oordination: Federal state, l ocal, tribal, a nd territorial ( SLTT) authorities ne ed to better unde rstand supply chai n networks a nd improve coordination , including i n storage and tran sportation, to m itigate suppl y chai n cha llenges in the future. Suppliers and private indu stry constitute a c omplex w eb that make up part of the public health supply c hain. Purcha sers do not always know the or igins of al l good s.viii Various f actors ca n contribute to the m aldistribution of f inished drug and PPE product s, including whole sale distributors a nd manufacturers no t knowing whether pur chases reflect clinical need or are being m ade i n anticipation of po ssible shortage in the future . As a r esult, purcha sers m ay acquire drug and PPE products i n excess of c linical n eed, t hereby ex acerbating or creating unnece ssary shortage s. The l ack o f coordinate d efforts c an also lead to purcha sing w ithout a wide r ange of efficacy a nd reliability, re sulting i n increa sed supply chain ri sks due t o counterfeit prod ucts, unv ette d supplier s, and more. 10 Strengthening the Supply Chain & Industrial Base S trengthening the Supply Chain & Industrial Base HHS performs a vital role in the public health supply chain and industrial base . It does this in part by leveraging its convening power to bring stakeholders together to monitor and improve public health supply chains . HHS agencies and offices work, often in collaboration with other departments , such as the Departments of Defense (DoD), Commerce (DOC), and Labor (DOL), to address cross -cutting supply chain challenges and t o strengthen the public health supply chain to ensure the United States has the resources it needs to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. HHS accomplishes these responsibi lities by contributing to the advanced development of critical MCMs ; acquiring, stockpiling, and distributing needed public health supplies ; implementing regulatory standards; and partnering and communicating with industry and other stakeholders to enhance supply chain visibility and to develop solutions to supply chain c hallenges. In addition, HHS, ensures medical products are safe for the American public to use . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Saf ety and Health (NIOSH) tests and approves respirators to ensure they meet regulatory standards and conducts studies on other PPE typ es to inform implementation guidance and performance specifications for voluntary consensus standards.ix The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ensures medical devices, drugs, and biological products, including vaccines, are safe and effective before they are approved for use by the public. FDA's shortage prevention programs and generic review processes help ensure that essential medical products are available and accessible to the people who need them. FDA advanc es public health by helping to speed innovations that make public health product s more effective, safer, and affordable , by bringing efficiencies to the drug development and review process and promoting robust competition for establishe d drugs , and by providing accurate, science -based information to the public . C urrent Actions to Build Public Health Supply Chain Resilience Themes with in the National Stra tegy for a Resilient Public Health Supply Chain include manufacturing and industrial base expansion (IBx) investments ; stockpiling, allocation, and coordination ; innovation ; trade policy and Buy American; regulations, policy, and s tandards ; workforce development ; global partnerships and standards ; governance ; external stakeholder engagement and coordination .HHS's role in the public health supply chain has grown and is increasing as part of the COVID -19 response. Efforts under EOs 14017 and 14001 (A Sustainable Public Health Supply Chain, issued January 21, 2021) have already galvanized a large part of the int eragency to fully implement HHS and national strategies. For example, HHS is expanding the PHIB and developing inno vative solutions to address critical deficiencies in the public health supply chain by working across the U.S. Government and with academia and the private sector. x Since the COVID -19 pandemic began, HHS and DoD have 11 Strengthening the Supply Chain & Industrial Base collaborated on more than $4B of investments to increase dome stic production of M CMs to provide a reliable supply chain of medical products and to reduce risk to industry partners by connecting t heir products with actual cust omers in the government and the private sector. St ability is essential if the Na tion is to count on the private sector t o invest in innovations, new facilitie s, and an expanded workforce. These improvements in domestic manufact uring must occur across the entire supply chain; the companies involved want to know there will be enough demand now and in the future to sust ain these expansions. HHS is i mplementing recommendations outlined in t he Na tional Strategy to addre ss critical gaps in the public health supply chain. Each recommendat ion is tied to specific interagency actions to mitigate root causes and bolster domest ic manufacturing resilience. Re commendat ions t hat affect the entire public healt h supply chain\u2014i ncluding PPE and DME, te sting and di agnostics, and ph armaceuticals and va ccines\u2014 and related activit ies are out lined below. Manufacturing and Industrial Base Expansion Investments Create Public Health Industrial Base and Supply Chain Management Program: HHS is consolidating IBx and DPA-r elated act ivities into a new program office in 2022 to align resources and strategic i ntent t o build domestic manufacturing capacit y. This new IBx office will work with industry to identify levers to support domestic manufacturing. Subsequent efforts will focus on industrial base partnerships, emphasiz ing a sustainable and diverse manufacturing portfolio to mit igate a future public health emergency. Establish DPA Title III9 9 DPA Title III is dedicated to ensuring the timely availability of essential domestic industrial resources to support national defense and homeland security requirements , accessed January 24, 2022. Program to build domestic industrial resources: HHS's DPA Tit le III Program will launch i n Summer 2022 as part of broader Departmental efforts to strengt hen the public heal th supply chain and to enhance industrial base capabilitie s. Dedicated to ensuring the timely availability of essential domestic i ndustrial re sources to support national defense, homeland securit y, and emergency preparedness requirements, the DPA Title III Program will target investments to sustain critical production, commercialize research and development investments, and scale emergency technologies to enhance or expand domestic PHIB capabilities. The program will work in partnership with key internal and external stakeholders\u2014including HHS office s, interagency partners, and industry\u2014to identify areas where critical industrial capacit y is lagging or non- existent. It will hel p reduce the Na tion's reliance on foreign supply chains, ensure the integrity of ma terials supplied t o the American people, and enhance national defense. The program is one of the key inve stment tools for HHS and the U.S Government to prepare for and respond to future public health and other threats to t he national defense.10 10 For the pur poses of the DPA, the definition of national defense includes military and energy production, military or critical infrastructure assistance to any foreign nation, homeland security, space, st ockpiling, emergenc y preparedness activities under The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S .C 5195 et seq. ), and critical infrastructure protection and restoration , accessed February 16 , 2022. 12 Strengthening the Supply Chain & Industrial Base Identify M echan isms for Susta inable Fund ing: HHS i s bui lding sustainable f unding streams f or IBx and supply chain activitie s.

Enhanc ing supply chain surveillance a nd monitoring w ill enable e arlier id entification o f concern s, issue s, and challenges a nd help bring this information t o leader ship a nd relevant a gencies sooner than might ha ve be en po ssible before . HHS is de veloping c onceptual frameworks to support i nformational needs, recruiting staff with supply chain and data a nalytic skill sets, and employing technical integration of exi sting da ta pl atforms a nd designs for f uture g rowth. Currently, the SCCT has eight di stributors wh o voluntarily p rovide limited data a bout the supply o f five PPE categorie s, 30+ pha rmaceutical s, and other medica l products on a near -daily ba sis.

The SCCT ha s also integrated suppl y sta tus from a round 5,000 ho spitals a nd 15,800 long -term care f acilities . The S CCT works clo sely w ith federal pa rtners to share information, develop capabilities, and support de cision making .13 13 The S CCT does not control the number of participating hospitals and long -term care facilities. It is based on the number reporting through teletracking and the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network.

Continuing innovation, development, and commercial deployment of these platforms, including through coordi nation with the Made in America Office and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, will enable distributed domestic drug substance and drug product manufacture. At the same time , these platforms will help strengthe n supply chain re silience, grow the bioeconomy, and deploy increasingly renewable and sustainable pharmaceutical resources capable of immediately responding to surges in demand caused by public health emergencies. Ensure Safe Waste Management Strategies: HHS is investing in research and development efforts to deliver safe and effective long -term waste management strategies to protec t huma n health and the environment. HHS will work in partnership with other federal agencies to de sign a nd execute t his work. Stockpiling, Allocation, and Coordination Transform t he SNS: HH S is transforming the SNS to create a larger, more diverse, and interlinked supply chain with S LTT and private partner capabilities, which are critical to the Nation's ability to prepare for and respond to public he alth emergencies . This transformation requires focu sing on the SNS's contents and ensuring the SNS has access to additional suppli es of MCMs by e xpanding t he domes tic PHIB and integrating comprehensive supply chain solutions. HHS is leveraging creative acquisition strategies and targeted stockpiling approaches that optimize shelf-l ife, enhance distribution, enable product rotation strategies with health delivery facilities, and account for scarce resource allocation deci sions. The SNS teams are working to increa se and sustain funding and promote horizontal c oordination across government, SLTT, a nd industry stakeholders to improve supply chain situational awarene ss and analytics for manufacturers. Develop MCMs Stockpiling Plan: HHS is developing a United States Medical Countermeasures Stockpiling Plan to tr ansform the U.S. Government's ability to monitor, manage, and grow the public health supply chain through stockpiles , visibility, and engagement. This plan will recommend enhance ments to information sharing and ensure juri sdictional stockpile s, which are maintained by SLTT and private sector entities, employ coordinated and complementary stockpiling strategies to those maintained by the U.S. Government and private sector. This information sharing and coordination will ensure MCMs that are necessary to pr event, diagno se, and treat diseases are readily available and deployable , if needed i n the future. The pl an will explore alternative approaches to stockpiling MCMs, including vendor -managed inventory, as well as bui ld strategies to develo p a common operating picture of MCM stockpiles. These changes will build stronger, more resilient stockpiles across all sectors and levels of government. Nati onal Framework for Al location of Co nstrained Re sources: The establishment of a national framework for SLTT planning, preparedness, and response is essential to ensure fair, equitable, and effective allocation of constrained resource s. The framework would establi sh a shared understanding of roles, responsi bilities, risks, processes, and systems required for pre -, intra-, and post-p andemic governance and management. The framework will facilitate coordinated information sharing, e nable cross- jurisdictional support during public health emergencies, and ensure consi stent and coordinated continuity of support. 14 Strengthening the Supply Chain & Industrial Base Innovation Speed Innov ation a nd Development o f Pub lic Health S upp lies: HHS i s in the early stages o f launching a virtual innovation center that w ill serve as a hub to speed the pace a nd direction of innovation f or public health supplies a nd facilitat e the processes and approvals r equired for m anufacturing pr oduct s. The innovation center w ill incorporate an effective organizational de sign, l everage no vel public -private partner ships, and sustain interagency c ollaboratio n that w ill invigorate a n underfunde d sector a nd catalyze new technological a dvances in PPE and broader M CMs. A ke y purpo se of t he innovation center is to facilitate expedition of the pr ocesses a nd approvals require d for dome stic manufacturing of t hese product s.

Further efforts a re underwa y to bolster t he resiliency of th e healthcare sector t hrough em ergency preparedne ss, which the CO VID-19 pa ndemic has show n de serves r enewed focu s. Increase Competitiveness of the U.S. Economy: The U.S. Government recognizes the critical importance of producing PPE in the United States, and towards this end, is implementing Buy American provisions to expand the industrial base for domestic PPE production capacity. It is also working to increase the competitiveness of the U.S. economy through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 's (IIJA) Made - in-America requirements aimed at bolstering domestic manufacturing and manufacturing supply chains.xi Section C of the IIJA, the \"Make PPE in America Act,\" establishes a PPE production program requiring the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ), HHS, and the Departme nt of Veterans Affairs (VA) to secure long -term contracts (of at least two years) for domestically manufactured PPE (e.g., powered air purifying respirators, protective eyewear , and gloves) to help ensure the sustainment and expansion of domestic PPE production. G overnance The National Security Council and National Economic Council will lead interagency efforts to coordinate existing programs that address national supply chain efforts . Transform the Public Healt h Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE): Efforts are under way within HHS to transform and reinvigorate the PHEMCE as a coordinating body across the interagency entities that govern or otherwise influence the supply chain to address public health supply chain issues . The PHEMCE will guide implementation of resilient public health supply chain processes based on adaptive and responsive inventory management practices for the SNS. Develop Annual Report: HHS is actively monitoring progress of imp lementation for each activity within the National Strategy through an annual report that summariz es and assesses ongoing activities intended to increase the public health supply chain's resilience. The report will outline key recommendations to mitigate vu lnerabilities and provide updates on current implementation and mitigation measures. The first annual report is expected in July 2022. E xternal Stakeholder Engagement External stakeholders \u2014including the HPH , regulated industry and trade groups acad and other researchers , SLTT authorities , and non- governmental organizations \u2014play a pivotal role in pandemic preparedness and response efforts . To realize a resilient domestic public health supply chai n, the U.S. Government must continue to build partnerships with external stakeholders. 16 Strengthening the Supply Chain & Industrial Base HHS a ims to i mprove coordinatio n and informatio n sharing t o increa se government v isibility into the public health supply c hain.

Ensuring PPE and DME are readily available for patients and healthcare workers may help prevent a public health concern from evolv ing into a public health emergency. In the early months of the COVID -19 response, the U nited States faced challenges procuring sufficient supply and effective distribution of PPE. Private, federal , and SLTT acquisitio n organizations struggled to procure PPE because of increased global demand. With the rush to procure supplies from a limited market, many purchasers made decisions based on PPE availability rather than on performance and quality, which resulted in delivery of incorrect or substandard products.xii Investments in increasing industrial base capacity has enhanced the ability to produce and acquire effective PPE. PPE supply chain challenges extend to DME such as: oxygen equi pment, continuous positive airway press ure and bilevel positive airway pressure machines, nebulizers , and other respiratory assistive device s. Most notably, ventilators were initially in short supply during the spring of 2020. By November 2020, ventilators had reached target threshold levels, and the SNS currently has more than 158,000 ventilators on hand (a ten-time increase over pre-pandemic levels ) and ~25 ,000 high flow nasal cannula kits available for deployment , which it did not previously stock. Current Overview The U.S. Government 's inves tments in key domestic manufacturing capabilities have improved the U. S. posture significantly since the COVID -19 pandemic began, both in quantities of PPE and DME stored in the SNS and domestic industrial manufacturing capacities. The most notable gaps we re in raw materials , such as nitrile but adiene rubber (NBR) for pharmaceutical and medical glove manufacturing and man- made fiber for gowns and surgical masks. HHS reports and strategies highlighted the lack of raw materials , and the Department continues taking steps to address this problem . The United States has sust ained and expanded the PHIB through recent investments to ensure its viability during public health emergencies . This includes a $250M investment in expanding and sustain ing the public health s upply chain and industrial base to reduce dependency on foreign markets for all PPE including gloves, gowns, respirators, and raw materials . FDA has taken action s to get PPE and DME to patients and those impacted by COVID -19, including issuing 28 guidance documents (including 21 revisions) outlining policies t o help expand the availability of medical devices needed in response to COVID -19; issuing Emergency Use Authorizations ( EUA ) or grant ing marketing authorization to nearly 2,000 medical devices for COV ID-19-related uses ; review ing nearly 13,500 applications for medical product approval , clearance, or authorization between March 2020 and September 2021 ; authorizing the use of 269 PPE devices, including 51 surgical masks, 205 filtering facepiece respirat ors, and iss uing 13 EUAs for face shields and other barriers intended to protect the user from bodily fluids, liquid splashes, or other potentially infectious materials. xiii18 Personal Protective Equipment & Durable Medical Equipment Resp irators and Masks Early i n the COVID -19 pa ndemic, a large i nflux of importe d respirators l ed the CDC to de velop an abbreviate d filtration efficiency te st for i mported non- NIOSH -approved re spirator s. Testing r evealed that a pproximatel y 60 percent o f more t han 780 i nternational r espirators p erformed b elow U.S. standard s. These reports he lped federal, state, a nd user communities i dentify substandard and counterfeit pr oduct s. CDC a nd FDA continue their efforts to e nsure availability of re spirators a nd ma sks despite the emergence of the highly contagious Omicron variant . During t he pandemic, FDA has i dentifie d and implemente d agile r egulatory a pproaches i ncluding assigning a dditional staff to P PE premarket review s, issuing E UAs, and relea sing g uidance. F DA a lso continues t o actively engage publ ic healt h and indu stry stakeholders t o monitor re spirator suppl y and demand and to c ommunicate t he status of suppl y and mitigatio n actions undertaken to f acilitate acce ss. Currently, the inventory o f NIOSH -approved re spirators and surgical m asks a re higher t han at t he start of the C OVID -19 pa ndemic. Globally, there ar e approximately 9 0 NIOSH -approved N95 m anufacturer s; most m asks a re produce d over seas, but l argely by companies he adquartere d in the United State s. However, vulnerabilities and the possibility o f sub- standar d or c ounterfeit goods st ill exis filtering f l evels r emain reactive to COVID -19 case surges. Currently, no conservation s trategies a re in ef fect and, assuming CO VID-19 m itigation protocols stay i n place , current models pr oject steady demand for surgical and procedural m asks in the future . Assuming m ax production capacity continue s, monthly N 95 filtering f acepiece respirator pr oductio n requirement s can be m et domestically. If i ndustry is una ble to provide additional capacity in the c ase of a nother de mand surge , fed eral an d state stockpiles c an provide time for manufacturers t o ramp up production. Of note, N95 filtering facepiece respirator dema nd is v ulnerable to CDC g uidelines a nd additional modeling e fforts a re required to v isualize t he impact o f changes in u se among the general publ ic. Gloves Commercial inventories of m edical -grade n itrile gloves acro ss m ajor di stributors ha ve risen over the l ast 12 m onth s; volumes a re now muc h higher t han at t he start of t he pa ndemic. The supply chain for ni trile gloves depends o n international sources f or bot h manufacturing a nd key raw m aterial s. Key m edical - grade glove manufactur ing is concentrated i n Southea st Asia,14 14 The four manufacturers with the highe st share of the global nitrile glove market are based in Malay sia. whic h is geographically clo se to the precur sor r aw material supply chain s, such as na tural r ubber . The Unite d States c annot cost ef fectively produce sufficient supply to m eet its o wn demand. Gowns There are several types o f surgical a nd non- surgical gown s, each with their o wn ki nd of barrier protection, complexity i n manufacturing, a nd regulatory r equirements. The global suppl y of m edical - grade gowns c ould grow by billions of gowns per year due to greater supply and cost c ompetitiveness from A sia a nd Europe . For certain gown s, these expan sion efforts w ill likely sati sfy U.S. demand in the 19 Personal Protective Equipment & Durable Medical Equipment near and long-t erm.15 15 There are four level s (L1-L4) and two types (surgical and non -surgical) of gowns . The gowns market is expanding with many entrants in L2 isolation gowns and global expansion efforts in L2 and L3 disposable gowns . U .S. demand is expected to decrease from approximately 3.5 billion (2 021) to approximately 1.4 billion gowns (o ngoing demand), which is an increase from 2019 levels but a decrease from 2020-2 021 levels. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of global manufacturing of finished gowns happens in Asia and some near shore, but companies headquartered in the Unite d States dominate , which provides opportuni ties to shape indus try by increasing domestic production and decreasing international r eliance. DME DME encompasses a wide range of products that include any equipment and supplies ordered by a healthcare provider for everyday or extended use (e.g., oxygen equipment, testing equipment, wheelchairs, ventilators). Resin, a component of DME plastic e quipme nt, experienced supply chain constraints during 2021. A series of natural disasters, including a winter storm and fires, caus ed power outages and plant s hutdowns across the petrochemical industry i n Texas and Louisiana. These shutdowns resulted in a m arked decrease in the production of medical -grade re sins, reducing allocations to the medical de vice i ndustry. De mand fluct uations ha ve compounde d supply chain vulnerabilities created by limited suppliers a nd mitigation delays. Overall , resin availability for m edical device and component manufacturing appears to ha ve stabilize d but w ill remain extremely fragile in 2022. A current e xception applies to medical manufacturing , where resin-b ased adhe sive or heat seal coating is used to create sterile barrier systems. Current Actions to Address Supply Chain Vulnerabilities The PHIB remains vulnerable without s ustained commitm ent; the demand for P PE and DME will eventually decline as the threat from COVID-1 9 subsides, and with it the cu stomer base for the PHIB. However , the U.S. Government has a vested interest in U. S. companies' continued marketplace viability and has made significant i nve stments to expand PPE production capacity. Since the start of the COVID-1 9 pandemic, the U.S. Government has made large investments to e xpand dome stic indus trial base capacity to meet vital PPE needs, including investments in N95 respirators (filtering facepiece and elastomeric i solation gowns, gloves , and raw material inputs for these items . Ongoing activities t o addre ss PPE and DME supply chain vulnerabilities a nd to strengthen the industrial base include: Growin g the Nation's S tockpiles: HHS works with industry and government partners to stabilize stockpile levels and enhance storage capabilities t o improv e the function, composition, and access ibility of the SNS . HHS l ed an interagency effort to address the early pa ndemic PPE supply shortage and re sultant purcha sing based on availability rather than quality or performance. The SNS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and SLTT governments have stockpiled more than one year's s upply of N95 respirators. In addition, since the onset o f the COVID -19 pandemic, NIOSH has added 30 new domestic approval holders, which have significantly added to the national inventory of respirators. The 20 Personal Protective Equipment & Durable Medical Equipment SNS h as awarde d contracts for a dditional gloves , which w ill meet or exceed its stockpil i ng target by May 2022. In the future, a dditional PPE standards w ill facilitate br oader acce ss to higher qualit y PPE. A dvanc D omestic Ra w M aterial Manu factur ing: HHS is asses sing o pportunities t o advance ni trile and key chemical m anufacturing i n the U nited State s. In addition, HHS i s seeking o pportunities t o facilitate warm- base m anufacturing opportunitie s. W arm-base m anufacturing refers t o the capacit y to be operationally ready qui ckly to manufacture MCMs during a re spon se. FDA is w orking to address s ilicone shortage s. Silicone is a ne w area of c oncern i n the supply chain becau se it i s essential to medical t echnology manufacturing .

NIOSH ha s worked to po ssible c ounterfeit re spirators a nd to coordinate with federal partners such as t he U.S. Customs a nd Border Pro tection Agency ( CBP) a nd the U.S. P atent a nd Trademark O ffice to establish s trategies t o manage c ounterfeit pro duct s, such as registering the \" N95\" 21 Personal Protective Equipment & Durable Medical Equipment trademark. FDA has also worked to identify possibly counterfeit PPE and works with device manufacturers and other government partners to communicate about these issues. FDA, CDC, and OSHA continue to coordinate their overlapping responsibilit ies and authorities about PPE, particularly respirators. A draft memorandum of understanding has been established to coordinate activities among these agencies. FDA, OSHA, NIOSH, and t he CBP have worked closely together t o detect and prevent counterfeit medical products from entering the market and have continued discussions as to how the agencies can continue to effectively work together to eliminate counterfeit and substandard products from e ntering the U.S. market. Regulations and laws, such as the Make PPE in America Act, can be used t o expand domestic product ion and promote greater use of PPE made in the United State s. Addressing the problem of count erfeit and substandard products offered for sale within the Unit ed Stat es will e nsure the dome stic consumer is able to access high-q uality PPE. Analyz ing Semiconductor Shortages and its Impact on Medical Devices: FDA has been working with medical de vice manufact urers to gai n greater visibility into the semiconductor supply chain. U.S. Government out reach t o device manufact urers is ongoing. In addition, FDA i s actively working with ASPR and DOC to analyz e the semiconductor shortage and its impact on the medical de vice industry, patients, and U.S. he althcare systems. Updating PPE Standardization System: Through NIOSH, HHS is addre ssing and updating the U.S. PPE product standardizat ion system to i mprove the efficacy, usage, effectiveness, safety, supply stability, and acce ssibility of PPE designed for use in U.S. healt hcare settings, by critical infrastructure workers, and for general public prot ection t o prot ect workers and reduce e xposure to infectious diseases in workplaces and communit y settings. NIOSH is est ablishing a Product Standardization Task Force to promote innovative approaches and technologies to streamline PPE manufacturing and to address availability and standardiz ation gaps and limitations for PPE and the technical methods, processes, technique s, tool s, and materials that support PPE development. Establishing Essential Medical Device List: FDA is leading an interagency effort that include s broad representation from public health experts and clinicians in the government, non-p rofit, and private sectors to develop recommendations for an essential medical device list (including device materials, component s, parts, or accessories) t hat are clinically essential for patie nts, healthcare workers, and the U.S. public. Increasing Vi sibility to Prevent Disruptions and Shortages: FDA is currently building a data analytics and predictive modeling platform to support visibility and prevention of supply chain disruptions and shortages of medical devices. Planned Actions to Address Supply Chain Vulnerabilities HHS i s incentivizing domestic raw materials production of NBR and key chemical s for gloves and of man- made fiber for gowns inve stment, public-p rivate partnerships, collaboration with industry, regulation, and propose d legislation in order to onshore or near- shore production capacit ies and reduce reliance on foreign product ion. 22 Personal Protective Equipment & Durable Medical Equipment The ri sks associated with a lack of medic al-grade PPE and DME directly impact the Nation 's ability to prot ect frontli ne medical profe ssional s.

Once shipped to the United States, raw materials are utilized to generate test kits and other reagents for use in both closed and open diagnostic systems. Early in the pandemic , shortages of a few common raw materials (e.g. , swabs, test reagents ) gave way to mo re widespread shortages of a variety of testing components and consumables (e.g., pipette tips, antigen test strip) , secondary to resin and nitrocellulose shortages. Many companies manufacture testing instruments and consumables internationally and ship them to the United States for assembly and kitting. Shipping logistics and skilled labor challenges are exacerbating supply chain issues for testing and diagnostic materials. When the pandemic first began, no tests for COVID -19 existed. CDC and the private s ector worked quickly to meet rapidly growing demand, and as of January 2022, there are two categories of tests \u2014 diagnostic and antibody tests \u2014produced by several different manufacturers. FDA has authorized the use of a number of tests under EUA, including individual EUAs for mole cular , antigen, antibody and other adaptive immune response tests for COVID -19. xvi Different tests may be conducted in a laboratory , healthcare setting, or completed at home and may vary in accuracy and speed. As the pandemic has evolv ed, the demand for tes ts has also changed. Since the beginning of the COVID -19 pandemic, the testing and diagnostic supply chain has been stressed and some of these challenges remain with acquiring, producing, and distributing almost all components of the testing supply chain.xvii Cu rrent Overview Testing supply chain limitations have largely arisen from molecular tests carried out in central laboratories. These tests are highly complex and require specialized equipment. They also involve numerous steps, including sample collection, storage, and transport; sample preparation, including extraction of nucleic acid; and sample analysis and processing. The number of end- to-end steps and actions involved with these tests illustrates the complexities and challenges a ssociated with the testing supply chain. In vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs), for both COVID -19 and other diseases , are made by a variety of test developers, including conventional manufacturers and laboratories. Manufacturers are in a variety of locations, including in the United States, Europe, China, India, and other countries . IVDs cover a wide range of devices spanning different diseases, conditions, and patient populations . Despite the current challenges and limitations, HHS has achieved notable succes ses. As of January 2022, FDA has authorized 4 23 tests and sample collection devices for SARS -CoV-2 under EUA , including 291 molecular tests and sample collection devices ; 87 antibody and other immune response tests ; 45 antigen tests ; 1 molecular and 3 ant igen prescription at -home test s; 69 molecular and 1 antibody authorization that can be used with home -collected samples ; 14 antigen and 3 molecular over -the-counter at -hom e tests ;24 Testing & Diagnost ics 25 antigen tests and 9 molecular tests for serial screening programs. FDA has also authorized 783 revisions to SARS -CoV-2-related EUA authorizations. Cu rrent Actions to Address Supply Chain Vulnerabilities To stabilize test production rates and related supplies and to reduce vulnerabilities associated with import delays, increased costs, and offshore sourcing , the U.S. Government has funded capital purchases to build, expand, and improve production of test kits and supplies, such as swabs and reagents ;17 17 The Small Business Administration continues to reexamine its current suite of loan products designed to support small businesses in faci ng supply chain challenges . It currently offers 7(a) and microloan programs, which provide businesses with up to $5 million for working capital and capital purchases such as equipment and real estate. It also offers the 504 program which can support larger real estate and equipment pur chase beyond the $5 million 7a program limit. impr oved coordination and information sharing with test suppliers to help sync production capacity with demands ; funded test manufacturers and their supply chain to onshore production of tests, test kit components, and reagents from non -domestic manufacturing plants . HHS is working to expand U.S. -based manufacturing of point -of-care molecular tests to avoid importing the s upplies and materials used in the tests. This work supports jobs for American workers , boosts the U.S. economy , and increases access to point -of-care molecular tests. Modeling Testing Demand : As of March 2021, the Pandemic Testing Board's Work Group on Supply and Distribution has been defining principles and strategies to achieve sufficient testing and upstream supply production. Since then, the ir demand model has been enhanced to explore simultaneous scenarios, such as high and low vaccination rates, high and low screening, high and low transmissibility, and high and low vaccine escape. Over -the-counter testing supply and demand are explored separately from laboratory testing supply and demand. Increasing Testing Capability : Since June 2020, the U.S. Government has invested in increasing the production of COVID -19 tests from 40 million per month to 257 million tests per month in September 2021 to over 400 million per month in December 2021. Demand for COVID -19 tests continued to rise in the last quarter of 2021 coinciding with the Omicron surge . U.S. Government investments in rapid antigen test production have incentivized the market to produce more tests . With COVID -19 case surges and testing mandates , HHS investmen ts are address ing the demand fo r lab -based tests, point -of-care tests, and at -home tests. Expanding At-Home Testing : Beginning in February 2021, the U.S. Government has used the DPA , industrial mobilization , and advance purchase commitments to ramp up supply of testing, including at - home, rapid tests. Advance purchase commitments allowed domestic testing manufacturers to increase production, add factory lines, increase staffing, and move up manufacturing timelines. As a result, the United States went from 24 million at-home, rapid tests on the market in August 2021, to 46 million in 25 Testing & Diagnost ics October, t o 100 million in N ovember, to over 3 00 million in D ecember, to 3 75 million in January 2022. U.S. Government inve stments i n at-home te sts g uarantee a specific num ber of tests w ill be bo ught a nd paid for , which provides stabilit y to t he supply c hain. In December 2021, the U.S. Government a nnounce d plans to e xpand free a t-home testing by purcha sing one billion tests to be distributed to the U.S. population. In January 2022, the U.S. Gover nment made 500 million at -home tests available for o rder o nline at n o co st to th e customer . It also announced employment -based group health plans a nd private health in surance companies w ill be r equire d to expa nd coverage o f at-home COVID -19 tests w ithout c ost sharing. I n February 2022, the A dmini stration announce d Medicare will c over o ver-the-counter te sts. The U .S. G overnment also plans to di stribute 5 0 million at -home tests t hrough neighborhoo d site s, community provider s, and rural c linics. The se actions provide much needed a ssistance to tho se who l ack t he financial m eans to pa y for te sting or for w hom accessing t esting s ites is d ifficult. The United States is o n track to qua druple the supply of rapid at -home tests a s compared to Summer 20 21 levels .xviii Accelerati ng D iagnostics : The N ationa l Institutes o f Health (NIH), in conjunctio n with other U .S. Government a gencies, establi shed the Rapid A cceleration o f Diagnostics ( RADx \u00ae)/Advanced Technology Platform s. The purpo se of this pr ogram is t o speed innovatio n in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID -19 testing .xix The pr ogram funds the de velopment and maturity o f COVID -19 di agno stic t echnology up to t he point whe n it is r eady t o be accelerated to market and supports t he validation a nd scale -up of manufacturing c apacity. Planne d Actions to Address Supply C hain Vulnerabilities The U nited States needs c ontinue d innovation, re search, a nd development i n testing a nd diagno stics. This i ncludes a dvances in at -home testing and data c ollection and analysi s, which could be leveraged now a nd during future large -scale infectious di sease outbreak s.xx There is a n eed to encourage a nd enable greater innovation to i mprove te sting technolog y and lower t he cost of te sting, so tests w ill be available t o all who w ant them.

I t will accompli sh this t hroug h stockpiling t ests and te sting supplies while simultaneou sly working clo sely w ith the i ndustrial supply chain. HHS w ill prioritize w arm-base productio n capacity t hat w ill allow te st, component, and reagent suppliers t o quickly scale up 26 Testing & Diagnost ics production during surges in demand. The U.S. Government is also planning inve stments to he lp reduce the costs of tests, broaden detection capabilities to include multiple viruses and pathogens, increase product ion, and make test s more widely available . The U.S. Government plans to i nvest furt her in training and human capit al. Fortifying a robust testing and diagnostics supply chain will ensure that te sts and diagnostics are ready to be developed, deployed, and analyzed during future public health emergencies. 27 Pharmaceuticals & Vaccines Pharmaceuticals & Vaccines Pharma ceutical s and vaccines play key roles in protecting the U.S. public's health. Disruptions to the pharmaceutical and vaccine supply chains can affect the United States' ability to reduce morbidity and mortality during public health emergencies by reducing access to critical drugs needed to treat patients and preventing effective partnerships with the private sector to develop and distribute vaccines . The United States must develop and implement strategies to mitigate risks and vulnerabilities in the se supply chains and strengthen domestic manufacturing capabilities to ensure patients have access to lifesaving treatments, especially during public health emergencies. Current Overview A robust pharmaceutical supply chain should include the capability to domestic ally manufacture certain high- quality products for U.S. consumption; diversification of the drug supply chain; redundancy of the supply chain (e.g. , having multiple manufacturers for each product and its precursors ).xxi A t present , the U.S. Governm ent has limited visibility into the supply chain for most pharmaceuticals . Locations of API manufacturers for FDA-approved or authorized prescription drug s are better known than those for over -the-counter products . Information about the volume of pharmaceutical s and APIs manufactured is hard to come by because not all approved sites are continuously active . Therefore, data is not collected in a way that clearly describes current end- to-end production. Key Starting Materials (KSM) : The U.S. Government has relatively limited information about KSM supply chains. Little KSM manufacturing takes place in the United States ; in addition to wage differences, certain foreign suppl iers are not subject to the same environmental and public health protection s as manufacturers in t he United States and can produce KSM at lower costs than U.S.-based manufacturers . Overall, in sufficient data are available to the U.S. Government, due to confidentiality practices among API manufacturers and KSM suppliers, so it is difficult to properly understand and assess supply chain vulnerabilities. Finished Dosage Form (FDF) : Some FDF manufacturing occurs in the United States. HHS expanded industrial base capacities for many drugs facing bulk production and fill -finish bottlenecks by examining the ma rket influences across pharmaceutical supply chains and initiating direct investments in platform technologies and additional fill -finish capacity. HHS established on- demand manufa cturing capabilities for API and fixed- dose formulation drugs. Therapeutic Development : During the COVID -19 response, new therapeutic development focused in part on mAb therapeutics. These require some of the same resources \u2014such as glass vials \u2014as vaccines to produce . Although there are currently no problems producing mAbs themselves , production is limited because of the difficulty in acquiring the glass vials required to deliver and administer these therapeutic s to patient s. Th is results in mAb shortages for the public. 28 Pharmaceuticals & Vaccines In addition to mAbs, there are several other COVID -19 treatme nts being studied, including 50+ agent treatments. Vaccines : Although not unique to vaccines, building capacity to manufacture biologic products , including messenger RNA vaccines and mAbs, has led to the development of innovative manufacturing platform technologies that improve flexibility, mitigate cross -contamination risk, and reduce time and cost of cleaning be tween manufacturing campaigns. FDA continues to use every tool available to help facilitate the development and availabi lity of vaccines and other biological products to combat the COVID -19 pandemic expeditiously and safely. FDA is working on many efforts to address the COVID -19 pandemic, such as helping to expedite development programs for vaccines and certain therapeutic biologica l pr oducts that hold promise to prevent or treat COVID -19 by providing timely interactions, scientific advice, and recommendati ons for individual sponsors and through issuance of guidance documents; supporting product development and facilitating the scaling up of manufacturing capacity for high priority products to treat COVID -19 and conducting timely reviews; expediting the revi ew of EUA requests and Biologics License a pplications for vaccines and other critical medical products to address COVID -19, including the evaluation of booster doses of COVID -19 vaccines and the use of COVID -19 vaccines in certain pediatric populations; helping to ensure an adequate and safe blood supply; providing information to healthcare providers and researchers to help them submit expande d a ccess investigational new drug application requests to permit the use of the FDA-regulate d i nvestigational products for patients with COVID -19.xxii Cu rrent Actions to Address Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Investments to address API and KSM supply chain vulnerabilities include domestic, direct production of APIs, including fine chemicals and catalysts , both more prevalen t in U.S. pharmaceutical production, and biologically derived APIs produced for antibiotics. HHS investments to date stand at $105M resulting in prototypes for increased capacities for drug products at more than 600 million doses for six medi cines in short age. HHS i s working to identify current product shortages , anticipate future shortages, and determine where and by whom the products are manufactured. HHS will then institute mitigation measures to ease or eliminate the shortages through investments to bol ster domestic production. Developing Essential Medicines List : In 2021, HHS assembled several consorti a of public health experts and clinicians in the government, non- profit, and private sectors to review the FDA Essential Medicines 29 Pharmaceuticals & Vaccines List18 18 FDA Publishes List of Essential Medicines , Medical Countermeasures, Critical Inputs, Required by Executive Order , accessed on January 24, 2022 . and recommend 50 to100 drugs that are most critical to have at all times due to clinical need and lack of therapeutic redundancy. An evaluation of the critical drugs list i s underway to identify vulnerabilities for those items, which will define strategies to ensure domestic supply and production of essential medicines. HHS is working with interagency partners, through industrial-b as ed assessment and inquiries, to identify APIs that are at risk and critical to drug manufacturing. HH S is also inve sting in technology and infrastructure development to improve dome stic capacity to produce APIs for a variety of essential medicines. Partner ing with the National Academies: Congress directed HHS to partner with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to assess the security and re silience of the U.S. medical products supply chain. The Committee on Security of America's Medical Product Supply Chain was t asked with ass essing U.S. reliance on critical drugs and devices sourced or manufactured outside the United States and making recommendations to strengthen the medical products supply chai n by addressing t hese depende ncies.xxiii To examine critical dependencies within ttee held information-g sess ions throughout 2021. was to u nderstand the end-u sers' d efinitions of essential medical devices, the formula for creating ess ential medical devices lists, and the impact these lists have on deci sion -making in order to inform strategies to mitigate the impact of failures in the medical product supply chain.xxiv Further exploration of this topic is now ongoing. Partner ing with the Interagency: In partnership with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Air Force, two efforts are underway for drug substance and drug product production. The combined investments of approximately $105M are enabling advanced continuous synthe sis of APIs, in support of cG MP-c ompliant manufacture of sterile injectable analgesics and sedative medications. The filing of an abbreviate d new drug application with the FDA i s planned during Q1 2022 for producing one of these drugs using these new methods. Advanci ng Ma nufacturing Ca pabilities: HHS is inve sting in the development of advanced manufacturing capabilities t o lower the cost of domestic manufacturing of critical s upplie s. Ad ditional innovations will spur development and deployment of novel manufacturing platforms; the scale-u p of thes e technologies will help develop the domestic pharmaceutical i ndus try. This work will address t he critical need to onshore the production of drug products and drug substances. Once establi she d, it will be critical to sustain this new domestic pharmaceutical ecos ystem. HHS will try to catalyze domestic pharmaceutical development by e nabling factors to enhance competitiveness. The se efforts include , but are not limited to, in creasing technological efficiencies (e.g., automation) in pharmaceutical proce sses to decrease costs i n production, enabling process intensification and scale-u p, and improving data sharing and security to maximize collaboration and minimize redundancy i n re search and development efforts. To accomplish these goals, it is necessary to strengthen partnerships with private partners and within 30 Pharmaceuticals & Vaccines government, including those presently e ngaged in fostering development and deployment of advanced manufacturing platforms. Gains in automation and improvements in e fficiencies will not reduce the need for skilled labor, but instead will create employment opportunities t hroughout the supply chain. Th e gains and improvements will also enhance workers' safety by reducing exposure to hazardous e nvironments and ensuring an enterprise that is safe, highly productive, and sustainable. Although the se activities will expand the abili ty to produce critical medicines domestically and increase competitiveness, without further effort vulnerabilities wi ll persist. In addition, ASPR19 19 BARDA's Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Consortium (B ioMaC ) Industry Day held on January 20, 2022. has begun to e stablish a consortium with partners across the drug and vaccine manufacturing supply chain, including manufacturers of raw materials and consumables and suppliers of fill-finish services, to transform and buil d core capabilities for biodefense. The initial effort focuses on MCM manufacturing and the role that public-p rivate partnerships can play in strengthening the Na tion' s biomanufacturing i nfrastructure. It will support ongoing efforts to e xpand the industrial supply chain for MCM production, manufacturing, and implementation. The consortium's goal is to e stablish the physical infrastructure, manufacturing platforms, and supply chains capable of producing enough vaccines for the entire U. S. population within 130 days and the global population within 200 days after recognition of a potential emerging pandemic threat. It expands the abili ty to domestically produce the therapeutics and vital supplies to halt future pandemics.xxv Creating a Rating System for Quality Management Maturity (QMM): HHS and FDA are constructing a program f or a rating system to incentivize drug manufacturers to invest in achieving QMM and sustainable compliance.20 20 QMM and cGMP compliance are distinct concepts , although sometimes correlated. QMM approaches align with cGMP compliance, but QMM also incorporates additional distinct elements. Th e program's purpose is to recognize manufacturers that develop mature quality management practices, which focus on continuous improvement, busine ss continuity plans, and early detection of supply chain i ssues. To bui ld this program, FDA has engaged with purchasers, pharmacies, and other federal agencie s. FDA has executed two pilot programs, one for domestic manufacturers producing FDFs and one for foreign manufacturers producing API, to develop an as sessment framework that can be used to rate the maturit y of observed quality management practices at parti cipating sites. Detecting and Managing Supply Chain Disruptions: FDA continues to buil d on current drug shortage initiatives b y leveraging available data, improving its visibility across business partners, and identifying data gaps needed to improve supply chain overs ight. FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Re search ( CDER) has recently establi s hed the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Governance Board to facilitate and coordinate all supply c hain initiatives acro ss CDER and provide s trategic guidance on major supply chain issues. 31 Pharmaceuticals & Vaccines , is overseeing t he allocation of m Abs on a state and t erritorial -level basis . Post allocation, HHS will continue to monitor therapeutic ordering a nd utilization at t he facility and state levels to prevent exce ss ive stockpiling a nd wa stage o f therapeutic i nventory. HHS is pl anning for the distribution of molnupiravir xxv i and is m onitoring inventory levels, which w ill allow for earlier detection of supply di sruptions and shortage s. St opp ing U nlawf ul Products : FDA ha s issued more t han 260 warning letters on the selling of unlawful, unprove n products bi lling t hem selves as effectiv e for th e tre atment, d iagno sis, or p revention of COVID - 19. In coordination wit h CBP, F DA ha s destroye d almo st 85,500 violative product s, totaling ov 15,050,242 t ablets, a nd other pply with I ndu stry: Currently, three COVID -19 vaccines ha ve been authorize d by FDA f or emergency use unde r EUAs, and tw o of t hese three ha ve been licen sed for use in certain population s.

B alancing t hese priorities a cross t he supply chain requires succe ssful c oordinatio n between the federal government a nd pri vate i ndustry.

The Federal COVID -19 R espon se Team a nd HHS have formulation and fill- finish manufacturing models f or each vaccine c andidate aligned to k now n final package f ormat ac ross a network o f U.S.-based capacitie s. Vaccine capacity is p rimarily dom estically based; however, H HS monitors t he supply chain for critical component s. Overall, vaccine demand will depend on a num ber o f factor s, including the impact o f variant s. Res ponse Element ( through the HHS Coordinatio n Operations and 21 21 Previously known as the Operation Warp Speed and the Countermeasures Acceleration Group . Pl anne d Actions to A ddress Supply Chai n Vulnerabilities HHS will continue to inve st in technolog y and infra structure development to improve d ome stic capacity to pr oduce A PIs use d for a v ariety of essential medicines. This include s technologies t hat will re sult in more sustainable pr oductio n technique s, more efficient manufacturing system s, and burgeoning research such as t he use of bio synthetic pathways t o potentially reduce t he suppl y chain footprint.

At the beginning of the COVID -19 response, shortages of PPE and DME and a n absence of testing and diag nostics hampered efforts to combat and contain the spread of the virus. These challenges highlighted pre -existing issues in the public health supply chain and industrial base, such as the lack of on- or near -shore manufacturing and sourcing for raw materials and finished medical products. Unless the U .S. Government takes action to create a more resilient public health supply chain, we may experience similar dis ruptions during a future public health emergency . Despite the challenges encountered since early 2 020, the U nited States has made great progress to shore up the public health supply chain and to address concerns regarding domestic manufacturing and supply chain surge capabilities. The U.S. Government has invested in efforts to fortify the domestic supply chain, rebuild the SNS, and expand and strengthen the PHIB. The increase in COVID -19 test production from 40 million per month in June 2020 to over 400 million per month in December 2021 is just one example of the success of these investments. The U.S. Government increased visibility and insight into the public health supply chain. Through collaboration and coordination with f ederal, SLTT, and private sector partners, the U.S. Government will continue to expand its visibility and awareness of potential public health supply chain challenges. This report is a snapshot of where the public health supply chain stands as of February 2022. It complements earlier rep orts including the National Strategy , the 100- Day Report , and the American Pandemic Preparedness: Transforming Our Capabilities Report . These documents outline the U.S. Government's efforts and commitment to ensuring that the United States has the critical resources it needs to protect the American people. These reports are only meant to be a foundation for building public health supply chain's resiliency. The U.S. Government continues to work in this area. The White House is leading federal efforts to iden tify strategies to address supply chain vulnerabilities, including those described i n the National Strategy . As part of that, ASPR is leading the development of an annual report, which will provide annual updates on the challenges, developments, and opport unities for the public health supply chain. In addition, as directed by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, a progress report will be submitted by the President to Congress annually through 2025, providing updates and evaluations of the strategy on securing supply chains for medical materials.xxviii In a similar vein , a W hite House -led effort to establish Biodefense Goals will complement the work underway to address the National Strategy actions. The actions outlined in this report will better ensure U.S. preparedness for the next public health emergency. Whether the public health supply chain is disrupted by another global pandemic, a weather event , or economic disruption, strengthening how the United States anticipates and manages chall enges will make the N ation more resilient and better prepared for future public health emergencies. 34 L ist of Acronyms API Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient ASPR Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response BAA Broad Agency Announcement BARDA Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority CARES Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CBP U.S. Customs and Border Protection CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDER Center for Drug Evaluation and Research cGMP Curre nt Good M anufacturing Practice COE Centers of Excellence COVID -19 Coronavirus Disease 2019 CSCRP Critical Supply Chain Resilience Program DHS Department of Homeland Security DME Durable Medical Equipment DOC Department of Commerce DoD Department of Defens e DOE Department of Energy DOL Department of Labor DOS Department of State DPA Defense Production Act EO Executive Order EUA Emergency Use Authorization FDA Food and Drug Administration FDF Finished Dosage Form H-CORE HHS Coordination O perations and Response Element HHS Department of Health and Human Services HPH Healthcare and Public Health IBx Industrial Base Expansion IIJA Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act IVD In Vitro Diagnostic KSM Key Starting Material mAb Monoclonal Antibody MCM Medical Countermeasure NBR Nitrile Butadiene Rubber NIH National Institutes of Health NIOSH National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health OSHA Occupational Safety and Health Administration PHEMCE Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise PHIB Public Health Industrial Base PPE Personal Protective Equipment 35 PPT Personal Protective Technologies QMM Quality Management Maturity RADx Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics SCCT Supply Chain Control Tower SLTT State, Local, Tribal and Territorial SNS Strategic National Stockpile VA Department of Veterans Affairs 36 Bibliography Alesch, Daniel J. and L.
