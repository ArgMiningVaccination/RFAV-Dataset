What is Homeopathy? Homeopathy is primarily focused at stimulating a positive response from the body's' own internal defence mechanism/s with the aim of enabling recovery repair and regeneration of whatever dis-ease the person is suffering from. Homeopathy is: RESPECTFUL - remedies do not chemically override your system, but work with it to stimulate your own self-healing and encourage your organism to find a new, healthy balance NON-TOXIC - highly-diluted remedies mean no toxic effects, which makes this form of medicine ideal to be used at times like pregnancy and infancy as well as alongside conventional treatment INDIVIDUAL - homeopathy does not treat conditions but the person: each remedy is selected strictly to match the whole of the patient's symptoms HOLISTIC - well-selected homeopathic remedies aim at improving the physical, emotional and mental health of the patient It's based on: \"Like treats like\" is the basic principle of homeopathy. Homeopathy is a complete system of natural, evidence-based, medicine which works on the principle that 'like cures like.' This means that a substance given in highly diluted form as a remedy can help treating the same symptoms it can cause when taken in large doses. A typical example is coffee: while in many people coffee can cause inability to sleep and an overloading of the nervous system, the highly diluted homeopathic remedy that is made from it can help people who suffer from a similar kind of insomnia . Homeopathy is a system of medicine that is over 200 years old and currently used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It works by stimulating the body's self-healing with small doses of highly diluted substances - these are called remedies. Homeopathy is the second largest system of medicine in the world today, as recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) History Homeopathy is a gentle, effective and non-toxic form of medicine that has been in use for over 200 years. The basic homeopathic principle of 'like cures like' was established by Hippocrates 2,500 years ago, but homeopathy as we know it today, was developed by a German physician named Samuel Hahnemann. He began his career as a doctor, but gave up his practice because he felt that his medicines and their side effects were doing more harm than good. He went on to experiment with giving reduced doses of potentially toxic medicine, and discovered that minute dilutions of a substance would cure his patients of the symptoms that a larger dose would cause. Homeopathy for the 21st Century The essential elements of homeopathy as taught by Hahnemann still hold true today. Homeopathy has grown to become the second most widely used system of medicine in the world. New remedies and ways of working continue to evolve, making homeopathy a truly dynamic energy medicine for busy people living in our complex world. Its success is due to several factors. Homeopathy is natural. Homeopathic remedies are based on natural ingredients. Homeopathy is completely safe. Even babies and pregnant women can use homeopathy without the danger of side effects. Homeopathy is holistic. It treats all the symptoms as one, which in practical terms means that it addresses the cause, not the symptoms. This often means that symptoms tackled with homeopathy do not recur. Homeopathy works in harmony with your immune system, unlike some conventional medicines that suppress the immune system. Homeopathy is a complementary therapy, and can be taken alongside other medication without producing unwanted side effects Remedies Remedies are made from a wide range of substances such as minerals plants and insects/animals. For example: marigold (Calendula), Sulphur (Volcanic ash) or (Apis) the sting of a bee. Homeopathic pharmacies make remedies by taking a small quantity of the chosen material and crushing or macerating it. It is then diluted many times, and succussed (vigorously shaken) between each dilution to release the energy of the substance. The end result is a remedy with great healing power, but without any trace of the original substance. This means that they are non-toxic, with no danger of overdose or addiction. Homeopathic remedies are available in a range of potencies, and are carefully chosen to match the symptoms and energy of each individual patient. Remedies come mostly from mineral, plant and animal sources and are selected to match the particular experience of each individual person - i.e. his or her physical symptoms, emotional states and mental processes.
