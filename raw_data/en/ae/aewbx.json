The CDC recommends updated bivalent Pfizer and Moderna vaccine doses that target the Omicron variants for everyone 6 months of age and older. The bivalent doses should be received at least two months after your most recent booster or primary series. Bivalent vaccines target both the original COVID-19 strain as well as Omicron and its subvariants. This updated version of COVID-19 doses offers stronger protections against severe illness and death from Omicron and its subvariants. Children aged six months through five years who previously completed a Moderna primary series are eligible to receive a Moderna bivalent dose at least two months after their final primary series dose. Children aged six months through four years who are currently completing a Pfizer primary series will receive a Pfizer bivalent vaccine as their third primary dose. Children aged six months through four years who have completed a Pfizer primary series with the monovalent (single strain) vaccine at least two months ago are eligible to receive a single dose dose of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine. Studies show immunity wanes over time with COVID-19 vaccines, increasing the risk of getting a breakthrough infection and spreading it to others. To protect yourself and your loved ones, get a booster shot [at any vaccination location](https://covid19.nj.gov/pages/finder). The CDC recommends completing a primary series with mRNA vaccines (e.g. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) or Novavax, which are preferred over the J&J vaccine for prevention of COVID-19. Eligible adults may choose which mRNA bivalent vaccine they receive. WHAT TO BRING TO YOUR APPOINTMENT No documentation is required. If you have your CDC Vaccination Card, you should bring it with you so that your next dose can be added to your card.
