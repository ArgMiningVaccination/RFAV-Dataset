One can feel thirsty to overcome dehydration. Serious forms of dehydration can be fatal especially in children and infants. - Diabetes Mellitus: Due to high blood sugar levels the person may feel thirsty and has a huge desire for frequent urination. Due to frequent urination, there is body fluid loss thus creating the desire for excessive thirst. Excessive thirst is thus one of the primary symptoms of diabetes. [Diabetic Ketoacidosis](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/management-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis/)(DKA): High ketones levels in the blood cause electrolyte imbalances. These imbalances affect kidney functioning and increase thirst. - Diabetes insipidus: this disease is caused due to imbalance of body fluids. The disease affects the kidney's ability to control the water within the body. This results in low vasopressin levels causing excessive water loss causing more desire to drink water and to urinate. - Sepsis: This is a serious life-threatening infection that causes damage to body tissues and organs especially kidneys. It results in dehydration and thus increases the desire to drink more water. - Mental illness like schizophrenia: it is found that 6 to 17% of mentally ill patients suffer from excessive thirst [2]. [Dry mouth](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/does-diabetes-cause-xerostomina-or-dry-mouth/): Dry mouth occurs when the salivary glands produce less saliva. This increases the desire of drinking causing thirst. - Kidney illness: Kidney disease can cause the failure of kidney control in regulating body water levels. This can cause excessive water loss resulting in more desire to drink water. - Medicine reaction: Taking medicines like diuretics and reaction of medicines causing imbalances in body minerals causes thirst. Summary Causes of Polydipsia can be diseases like diabetes, diabetes insipidus, dehydration, kidney illness, mental illness, dry mouth, diabetes ketoacidosis, or medication reactions. Symptoms of Polydipsia Having a constant desire to drink water despite drinking water may be an indication of health problems that can cause serious health issues.

The body cells use this glucose to release energy. But in diabetes mellitus, the blood glucose levels are high. The body cells become either insulin resistant or there is insulin deficiency. Thus, the glucose remains free in the blood. In such a scenario with high blood glucose levels, the kidneys work hard to remove this excessive glucose from the blood. This increases the desire to urinate frequently. Excessive urination causes the desire for thirst. Thus, the person with diabetes feels thirsty and urinates frequently.
