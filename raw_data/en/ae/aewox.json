Sisu, Shop Assistant Sisu may like to think that the shop was named after her fine regal self, but both Sisu and the shop's namesake comes from the Finnish word for courage through adversity, and the recognition of the tenacity, beauty and strength that lives in every individual.

She's an absolute charmer despite a sometimes grumpy expression, and can normally be found relaxing in the shop sunshine charming the socks of unsuspecting passersby. "}
