The protocol essentially splits tasks which usually would have been carried out by one person - a registered healthcare professional into several stages so that they can be carried out by a range of different people which allows for a more efficient throughput in large vaccination centres. The clinical assessment and preparation of the vaccine would need to be carried out by a registered healthcare professional with the relevant skills and qualifications but biomedical scientists can undergo training to allow them to administer the vaccine under clinical supervision. Details of the training Biomedical Scientists would need to complete to enable them to do this is outlined here: [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccinator-training-recommendations](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccinator-training-recommendations) If you are interested in a vaccinator role you can register your interest "}
