IIGB and its two Centers continued their mission to promote community engagement and a ugment student and trainee development to foster research excellence. IIGB's mission to seed multidisciplinary research projects were enhanced by events that stimulated dialogue among its researchers and provided members a voice in our community. A State of the Union and public forum were added to IIGB's annual Symposium to encourage collaboration and communication regarding the direction of IIGB. IIGB advanced its Cor e Facilities for UCR researchers and outside clients with an increased repertoire of tools for genomic, metabolomic and lipidomic, and proteomic research . Recruitment of recently trained PhD -level specialists in lipidomics and proteomics were completed , while a bioinformatics candidate has been identified and will be finalized next fiscal year. Mechanisms for communication between Core staff and users were enhanced to increase efficiency and offerings in key areas o f service and instrumentation. Through careful financial oversight, appropriate budgetary reallocations, and insight from Core Committees , the Core Facilities are operating admirably, and the Genomics Core is no longer operating under a deficit. Now, further efforts will be dedicated towards increasing efficiency, expanding clientele within and outside UCR , and supporting diverse research needs of the UCR community. The Center for Plant Cell Biology (CEPCEB) enha nced student and trainee development via its 17th year of invited seminars, donor -sustained awards, and annual Noel Keen Distinguished Lecture and a symposium . CEPCEB host ed its 18th NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduate ( REU) cohort , evaluated its 18-year legacy of impact, and applied for continuation of this program. CEPCEB obtained its second prestigious 5 -year $3million interdisciplinary graduate training program, the NSF Plants3D NRT . This program bridges life sciences, chemistry and engineering. The Center for Infectious D isease Vector Research (CIDVR) host ed its 9th annual Southern California Eukaryotic Pathogen Symposium (SCEP ) in the fall of 2019 with over 100 participants from UCR, UCSD, UCLA , UCI, UCD, UCSB, Cedar -Sinai, Cal S tate, and the University of Arizona. Over 12 talks and 30+ posters were presented. The center raised over $6 ,000 (from departments and private companies such as Nanostring, 10X G enomics, Thermofisher) to offer this sym posium free of charge to faculty, students , and post -docs. IIGB and its Centers promoted individuals in research, hands -on teaching as well as local, national, and international outreach activities . Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 5 MISSION STATEMENTS IIGB : UCR's Institute for Integrative Genome Biology seeks to f oster and support interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers on campus and in the scientific community utilizing a systems- based approach to science. To train students and postdocs in interdisciplinary research; to develop novel approaches and technologies to solve complex biological problems; and to explore the transnational development of potentially commercial technologies and projects. IIGB manages Core instr Biology synergizes UCR's existing strengths in plant and microbial sciences and provides an infrastructure that promotes interdisciplinary research and interaction among researchers to conduct research using multidisciplinary approaches applied to both model plant systems and important crop plants. Although the Center is nucleated around plant biology, its research and training mission extends from biological sciences to other disciplines, including applied mathematics, statistics, engineering, physics and chemistry. CEPCEB hosts the Plants3D NSF National Research Training (NRT) and th e CEPCEB Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program. CIDVR : The Center for Infectious Disease Vector Research investigate s infectious diseases in general , and diseases transmitted by insects (Vector -borne diseases) that continually threaten global health issues in particular . The Center functions through cross -disciplinary research by combining expertise in molecular biology, nanotechnology, gene silencing , and the genomics -based sciences with expertise in insect pest control. The Center also includes laboratories working in infectious diseases in plants such as Huanglongbing disease in citrus and the P ierce's disease of grapevine that continually threaten agriculture, reduce agricultural productivity, and disrupt ecosystems throughout the world. The overarching goal of the center is to provide practical solutions within therapeutic and economic time frames. Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 6 MAIN ACTIVITIES RELATED TO MISSION, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES IIGB 3rd Annual Symposium (October 4, 2019) (Attachment A ) The 3rd Annual IIGB Symposium was held on October 4, 2019 in the Genomics Auditorium. The Symposium aimed to enable the greater IIGB multidisciplinary community to form new contacts and collaborations as well as gain greater insight into the science presented in the Institute. The 3rd Annual Symposium was focused on introducing new technologies and the application of these technologies in research, including using metabolomics and imaging.

A State of the Union and Forum was also held to provide members with a platform to voice their thoughts on the continued growth and direction of IIGB. The event was attended by 129 community members. We also held our 2nd annual IIGB logo competition and announced the winner (David Hur) during the symposium. Logos are then used towards various IIGB programs and products to promote the Institute and fundraise for student development programs. Submissions from left to right: David Hur, Hannah Chu, & Megan Hsu 9th Annual Southern California Eukaryotic Pathogen Symposium (SCEP ) (October 30, 2019) (Attachment B ) The 9th Annual Southern California Eukaryotic Pathogen Symposium ( SCEP ) was held on October 30, 2019 in the Genomics Auditorium at the University of California. The Keynote Speaker was Christopher Hunter, the Mindy Halikman H eyer distinguished professor of pathobiology at University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. He presented the talk \" Immune responses to Toxoplasma\". The Annual Southern Californian Eukaryotic Pathogen Symposium (SCEP) brings together research ers, including faculty, postdocs and students, from more than 15 different labs from Southern California that investigate the inner workings and host response to these important pathogens. It is the aim of this symposium to bring together these like- minded but individual groups to facilitate interaction and collaboration. The event had over 100 registered participants from UCR, UCSD, UCLA, UCI, UCD, UCSB, Cedar -Sinai, Cal State and the University of Arizona. Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 7 Plants 3D NRT Retreat (November 15 -17, 2019) (Attachment C ) The inaugural event for our new graduate program was the first annual NSF -sponsored Plants 3D NRT Retreat. This was held the weekend of November 15 -17, 2019 at the UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference Center. Forty -eight individuals attended this inaugural 2 .5-day event for the Plants3D NRT program. Participants included faculty (21), graduate students (20), postdoctoral researchers (3), a coordinator and invited guest and keynote speaker, Professor Joff Silberg (Steward Memorial Professor, Department of BioScience s, Rice University, TX). The event organizers were Sean Cutler (BPSC, coPI), David Nelson (BPSC, Participant Faculty) and Ian Wheeldon (ChemEE, co -PI). The retreat objectives were to 1) introduce members of CNAS and BCOE to the mission and plans for the n ew five -year trainee program, 2) provide an opportunity for faculty to work together on the program plans and 3) stimulate development of collaborative projects between plant and plant microbe biologists, engineers and computer scientists. The program open ed with a talk on the vision, the presentation by the guest, and a demanding challenge from the organizers. Every participant was to identify another individual with whom to develop an interdisciplinary project to be presented in the Sunday morning session of the meeting. The second day included nine research presentations, a faculty meeting, and a poster session that was critical to the challenge activity. On Sunday morning, \"Lightening Talks\" were presented on the projects. The overwhelming majority of non-faculty attendees were primarily first and second year graduate students in graduate programs that had expressed interest in the program. The three postdoctoral participants were individuals known to be working on cross -disciplinary projects who were included to enhance representation and facilitate interactions. The NRT program's external evaluator, Tarek Azzam (UCSB), evaluated the event so that feedback could be leveraged to evolve the event. CEPCEB 1 7th Annual Distinguished Noel Keen Lecture and Awards Ceremony (December 13, 2019) (Attachment D ) The 2019 Distinguished Noel T. Keen Lecturer was Zachary Lippman, the Jacob Goldfield Professor of Genetics at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, who presented a talk on \"Dissecting principles of quantitative trait variation in plants\". Dr. Lippman is distinguished for his work on diverse traits of tom atoes and other nightshade ( Solanum ) species that are relevant to agriculture. He has made notable findings on genome variation, gene redundancy and epistasis associated with the development of flowers and fruit, and the process of domestication of tomato and other Solanums. His group pioneered the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to tune the cis -regulation of gene transcription to modify traits of tomato fruit. His research will enhance the nutritional value and yields of crops. Zachary was recently recognized as an HH MI Investigator and a MacArthur Fellow. The 17 th Annual CPECEB Award Ceremony was held December 13, 2019 in the Genomics Auditorium. The purpose of the event is to enable members and friends of CEPCEB to form new contacts and collaborations as well as gain greater insight into the science presented in the Center. The CEPCEB director summarized the State -of-CEPCEB, which included announcements of notable achievements by the community over the past year. She also expressed deep gratitude towards Rochelle Campbell and her daughter Allison Campbell for their $150,000 endowment towards the CEPCEB Undergraduate Researcher Award Fund. The event was attended by 123 IIGB/CEPCEB researchers and included an evening reception. Please see Attachment for the program and speakers.

Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 11 Symposium Organizer: Julia Bailey -Serres - CEPCEB Director Awards Committee: Juan Pablo Giraldo, Botany & Plant Sciences Yanran Li, Chemical & Environmental Engineering Titouan Bonnot (Post Doc) - Botany & Plant Sciences, Dawn Nagel Lab Amy Boyd Graduate Student) - Microbiology & Plant Pathology, Howard Judelson Lab CIDVR's Seed Grant Program (2018 - ) The collaborative Seed Grant program that was implemented in 2018 -2019 has been quite successful at creating new collaboration s, publication s, and grant submission s. The CIDVR seed grant program was intended to boost and initiate infectious disease research projects at UCR to improve UCR competitiveness for multidisciplinary grants. The center planned to create a new call for new proposals this year, but with budget cuts, this program will most likely need to be cancelled. IIGB's CONTRIBUTIONS TO UCR'S GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING PROGRAMS: It has been of paramount importance for IIGB and its Centers to provide opportunities for students and trainees to excel in their research endeavors. IIGB faculty are entrusted with inspiring students to pursue the scientific fields, and to cultivate those interests into passions while they are in the early stages of their careers. In reflection of what our community was able to achieve this past fiscal year, IIGB faculty had over 454 lab members within 42 labs* that consisted of students (high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels) and trainees. Of the undergraduates repo rted by faculty, 49 were named on a publication while 7 were acknowledged. *This data is based upon faculty response and represents 42 out of 119 active IIGB PIs' labs: 23182167 82 HIGH SCHOOL UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATE POSTDOCIIGB & TraineesInstitute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 12 In providing these opportunities early on, students mentored by IIGB faculty have f ormed connections and experiences that have proven to be invaluable over time. The High School students have won awards on the county and district levels. The graduate students have received mini -grants and scholarships and become MARC U -STAR fellows, whil e many more have been accepted to their PhD or professional programs of choice. Providing students and trainees with the tools they need to succeed in their chosen career paths is a part of IIGB's mission, and one that our faculty embraces . CEPCEB's Initiatives for Student Training and Motivation The CEPCEB mission is to address significant questions in plant biology on a molecular level to meet such global challenges as improved nutrition, increased crop yield, resistance to pests, sustainable biofuels, and environmental conservation. CEPCEB researchers also harvest plant metabolic pathways and identify basic genetic mechanisms of value and relevance to human health and environmental protection. CEPCEB foste rs training of a diverse community. To enhance the competitiveness of these individuals, we seek opportunities that blur the lines between disciplines, engage world -class resea rchers and industry, and cultivate advances that integrate biology, computation bi ology, engineering, and chemistry. CEPCEB's efforts , chemical proteomics, microscopy , and bioinformatics paved the way for establishment of several Cores of IIGB. Over the past 17 years, CEPCEB's training and interdisciplina ry initiatives have been funded by major NSF grants including a ChemGen IGERT program (2005- 2017) and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program (2002- present) . In 2019, CEPCEB received a five -year $3 million graduate training program. Plants3D NRT (Julia Bailey -Serres PI, with Ian Wheeldon, Blanch, Sean ) is an NSF -sponsored graduate training program for biologists, engineers, and computational scientists that melds plant and microbial biology with engineering technologies to discovery, design and deploy plant -inspired solutions f or agriculture and biotechnology. Trainees will combine biology, engineering, and computation to Discover, Design and Deploy agricultural and biotechnological solutions to benefit mankind. Initiated in the fall of 2019, Plants3D will foster collaborative i nteractions and entrepreneurial skills to address the challenges related to food security and human health. It will leverage genomic resources and the biological and engineering tools of synthetic biology to understand stress sensing and protective respons es, plant -microbe interactions, and to increase production of high -value phytochemicals. In addition to the impact on a diverse cohort of trainees in CNAS and BCOE, this translation of basic research to practice will increase UCR's intellectual property po rtfolio and opportunities for technology transform. The program was initiated by a $3 million dollar grant. Major program accomplishments in FY 19/20 include an inaugural retreat at the UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference Center , selection of the first cohort of 13 PhD fellows (10 funded domestic and 3 international trainees) and the development and offering of a course on project design and entrepreneurship, taught to 15 students in four graduate programs by Harvey Blanch (ChemEE) and Julia Bailey -Serres (BPSC) . Institute Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 13 NRT Leadership Committee Julia Bailey -Serres, Ian URM education specialist CEPCEB 's Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) Program (2015 -20) The NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program was first awarded to CEPCEB researchers in 2002 for a period of three years (Elizabeth Bray PI and Julia Bailey -Serres coPI then PI) and renewed in 2005 for five years (Patricia Springer PI and J ulia Bailey -Serres). In 2010, under PI Howard Judelson and co-PI Patricia Springer, the REU program was renewed for an additional five years. The 2010 -2015 award titled \"REU Site: Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Plant and Plant -Pathogen Cell Bio logy\" totaled $614,097. In 2015, the NSF REU program was renewed for another five years under PI Thomas Eulgem and co -PI Howard Judelson and was titled: \"REU Site: Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Next Generation Plant Biology\". The total award w as $662,147 and is active until 3/31/2021, extended in 2021 due to COVID -19. The program was not held in 2020. Carolyn Rasmussen and Thomas Eulgem have submitted a renewal proposal for this program. As an NSF REU Site, CEPCEB brings research experiences to students of two - and four -year colleges who have limited opportunities to learn about the excitement and career options that research in plant cell biology offers. Eight to twelve students are accepted into the ten -week residential program. The program begins with a one -week workshop, in which students are introduced to techniques and approaches used for analysis of plant and plant fungal pathogen cell function, including basic molecular biology, genomic and bioinformatics analyses, and confocal analyses , and confocal microscopy methods used to study live cells. Students then spend nine weeks working with a CEPCEB faculty mentor and a graduate or postgraduate mentor on a research project of their choice. Projects are currently focused on plants and/or plant pathogens and involve a \"next -generation biology\" component, such as not limited to) HTS sequencing, confocal microscopy, proteomics, high throughput chemical genomics or metabolomics. Students also participate in workshops to enhance lear ning skills and professional development, and to discuss ethics in science and present their work at an internal symposium. Thus far, over 1 80 undergraduate students have been trained in CEPCEB labs since the program's inception, with half of them proceedi ng to graduate school. It is estimated that approximately 80% have pursued studies related to academic science fields. The following 14 students participated in the 201 9 REU Program in CEPCEB Labs and presented a poster session at the REU Symposium on August 23, 2019.

Here are some highlights of the program sustained by four NSF grants since 2002 and the impact of the program. Thomas Eulgem and Carolyn Rasmussen, PIs of the submitted renewal propo sal prepared this information . This assessment illustrates the value of this program to CUR. 1) DBI -0139555, \"REU Site: Research Experiences for Undergraduate Students in Plant Cell Biology\" (PI: Elizabeth Bray; co -0453541, \"REU Site: Undergraduate in Plant Cell Biology\" (PI: Patricia Springer; co -PI: Julia 10). 3) DBI -1004793 \"REU Site: Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Plant Plant -Pathogen Cell Biology\" (PI: Howard Judelson; DBI -1461297 \"REU Site: Research Students Biology\" (PI: Thomas Eulgem; 21). The CEPCEB -REU program, established in 2002, was designed to provide a supportive and authentic hands -on internship experience to undergraduates that informs and prepares them for graduate school and careers in science. A key objective was to provide authentic research experiences to undergraduates who lacked such opportunities at their home institu tions. Based on student feedback and our own observations, as well as the shifting needs in STEM related fields, we have continuously modified the Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 15 program to further improve it. A primary goal was to train women and members of under- represented groups. We consequently focused recruitment activities towards students from community colleges and small institutions such as liberal arts colleges that lack significant research programs in the biological sciences. The number of applicants ranged in the past fund ing period between 124 and 137. To maximize the impact of NSF funds, most admittances were to students at early or mid -level stages (Figure 1) based on the idea that the REU should help steer them to a scientific career. During the past five -years we admit ted 35 (58%) women and 25 (42%) men. Figure 1: Demographic profile of undergraduate participants in the CEPCEB REU. Figure 2: Career outcomes of those that completed their undergraduate degree already. Data are based on students from the 2010- 2014 and 2015- 2019 cohorts, for whom outcomes could be tracked (84%) and who have finished their undergraduate degrees. The absolute numbers of students considered for this analysis are as follows: 69 for \"All participants\", 42 participants\" and \"20 for \"All Hispanic participants\". Not shown is that all three Native Americans/Pacific islanders participating from 2010 - 2019 in our REU ended up in lab technician positions. Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 16 Demographics of the 60 participants between 2015 & 2019 are compared to those of the 83 student participants between 2002 & 2009 and the 60 participants between 2010 & 2014 in Figure 1. As in the previous two examined intervals, the vast majority of admitt ances were made to sophomores and juniors at the time of application. In the 2015 -19 interval 40% of participants came from under- represented minority (URM) groups (African American/Black, Hispanic, Pacific Islander or Native American); a clear increase co mpared to the 29% of students from this category in the previous 5 -year interval. However, compared to the 2002 -09 period, the participation of Black students dropped from 24% to 5% (2010 - 14) and 7% (2015- 19). If refunded, we will aim to increase partici pation from Black students and to increase participation from all URM groups to 60%. To assist in this, we have connected with additional faculty at HBCUs and Minority Postsecondary Institutions, such as Fort Valley State University, Chaffey Community College, San Bernardino Community College, Cerritos College and Universidad Ana G. M\u00e9ndez. For the entire duration of our program, the majority of our participants came from small colleges or community colleges. Figure 2 illustrates that our program goals were met. Irrespective of their ethnic background (non URM, URM, Hispanic or African American) more than half of all students participating in our program from 2010 to 2019 that have completed undergraduate studies entered graduate school or pursued science -based professions (such as lab tech or similar profession). A recent survey of final career outcomes for students participating in our program from 2002 -2014 showed that many of them were in senior level positions in academia or science -related careers. Not able examples of successful Black program participants include Isha Wallace (REU 2002), who completed a PhD in UCR's CMDB program and became a senior technical applications scientist at Illumina, Marjammie Eloi (REU 2002), a Biology Professor at California State University of Sacramento and Kebba Mbye (REU 2014), a Stem Cell Laboratory lead at iOrthoBIOLOGIX. Impressive examples of Latino program participants include Ivann Martinez (REU 2004) who completed a PhD in UCR's CMDB program and is now a Professor at Cerritos College, Judy Ann Melendez (REU 2004), a Professor at Universidad Ana G. Mendez in Costa Rica, Benjamin Becera (REU 2005), an Associate Professor at Loma Linda University and Maritza Duarte (REU 2008), co -founder and head of genomics at Pattern Ag. Christopher Massimino (REU 2010) works as an ethnobotanist at the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden. Several recent participants have commented on how the program impacted them. Charlotte Grace Sprehn (REU 2010), now at the Genome Institute of the Lawrence B erkeley National Lab attributed \" the experience at UCR with giving [her] confidence to reach out at professors and start working as an undergraduate at [her own] university, which led to her graduate position\". Several of our more recent students are pursu ing graduate programs or postdoctoral training at top institutions, such as Mathew Holmes (REU 2013), at the MCB program at Harvard, Tamera Taylor (first generation college student, REU 2017) at UC Davis , Katie Orban (REU 2014), at UCS or Apolonio Huerta ( REU 2011) at the ETH in Zurich (Switzerland). Penelope Lindsay (REU 2011) is currently a post -doc at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Rebekah Silva (REU 2008), a Latino REU participant and post -doc at Caltech, stated that she often \" thinks fondly of her research experience at UCR \" and that our \" REU program was incredibly influential in [her] decision to pursue a career in research\" . Collin Murphree (REU 2008) is a scientist at USDA/APHIS. Environmental Conservationist Seth Flanders (REU 2013) found our p rogram to be \" one of the most productive and informative internships [he] ever had \" and that \" it should definitely be continued and funded\". Brooke Gomez, (Latina, REU 2016), now a clinical lab scientist, stated: \" This program was a great opportunity that allowed me to gain experience early on in my studies. It greatly benefited me in obtaining a spot in an extremely competitive program to further my postgraduate career \". Joel Valesco (REU 2016,2017), a Latino military veteran, now a graduate student at Was hington State University summed up his experience with us by saying \" I would like to express my gratitude for such a life changing opportunity .\" Velasco has two co -authorships from his UCR research.

Over 900 participants from 400 schools were expected to present their projects this year, but due to COVID -19, the e vent scheduled for April 20 -21 was cancelled. Miscellaneous Outreach Activities : Julia Bailey -Serres served as an Associate Editor for the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Plant Physiology. She was a Scientific Advisory Board member of companies, institutes and professional societies. She published an invited review in the 100th Anniver sary issue of Nature . She delivered 15 seminars/talks at institutes or conferences, and remote lectures to undergraduates internationally and locally. She interacted often with the media to discuss her research and provide expertise on agricultural genomic s and plant stress biology. She mentored a high school student who won regional and international science fairs and was an ISEF 2020 finalist, supervised 10 undergraduate researchers, and had 2 former undergraduates publish this year. She leads the new NSF Plants3D NRT program. Venogopala (Reddy) Gonehal was an invited presenter at the International Conference on Arabidopsis Research in June 2019 at Wuhan, China, and also served as the session chair. Lab members Kevin Rodriguez, Alexander Plong, and Alber t Do were presenting authors at the FASEB Mechanisms in Plant Development (Olean, NY), 9th Annual Southern CA Regional Systems Biology Conference (UCR), and the 2019 ASBP Conference (San Jose, CA), respectively. Alexander also participated in UCR's 2019 Pl ant Discovery Day, which was cancelled in 2020. Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 18 Sachiko Haga- Yamanaka engaged in STEM education for high school students in Tohoku, Japan and Riverside STEM Academy. She designed a research project and is currently instructing students in both locations. She discusses research progress with each group on site or via Skype, and sometimes bridges these two groups by translating languages. Her lab's goals are to present their research at a conference and to publish a research article in a scientific journal. Zhenyu (Arthur) Jia's lab continues to work with UCR outreach programs and local unified school districts to promote interest in genetics and education about healthy foods among schoolchildren. Howard Judelson served as a judge for the RUSD Science Fair. Wenxiu Ma participated in CNAS's SISTERS (Success in Science & Technology: Engagement with Role - models) program and gave a workshop to a group of middle school girls from University Heights Middle School in Oct 2019. Morris Maduro mentored a high school student from North High School to perform some molecular biology experiments, and also sought to increase diversity among his undergraduate lab members. Carolyn Rasmussen's lab were participants in Science night at Stork Elementary school, led by graduate student Alison Mills with support from Aimee Uyehara, Carolyn Rasmussen, and Micah Uyehara on March 5, 2020. Elementary students made glue impressions of maize leaves, and then examined them under a light microscope. Danelle Seymo ur participated in events for citrus industry (Lindcove fruit display, UCR Citrus Day). Jason Stajich's lab is affiliated with five graduate programs (MCBL, PLPA, GGB, EEOB, and BMBL), and Stajich has served as Program Director for the Microbiology for th e last five years as well as the Graduate Advisor for the most recent two years. He mentored three undergraduates for research -for-credit in 2019- 20 and is currently advising three students over the summer via remote learning research projects. He is now C hair of UCR's Academic Senate. IIGB Facilities To urs (Attachment G ) In an effort to showcase Keen Hall's advanced tools in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics; to assist in recruitment efforts of top -notch faculty and graduate students; and to introduce campus researchers to the newest technologies and tools for their r esearch, IIGB's core managers and staff regularly participate in conducting tours to a wide range of visitors. During fiscal year 2019- 20, a total of 51- 194 tours were conducted in each core (194 total attendees) . Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 19 IIGB INSTRUMENTATION FACILITIES The II GB instrumentation facilities seek to meet the needs of campus researchers through instrument upgrades, the acquisition of new technology, and collaboration with researchers working on a broad range of organisms and technologies , and training on new and es tablished instrumentation. Genomics Core Core Personnel : Matthew Collin, Holly Clark, & Clay Clark The Genomics Core Facility of IIGB provides DNA sequencing, quantitation, and library preparation services. The services most utilized are: Sanger Sequencing, Illumina Sequencing, library preparation, and Bioanalyzer (i.e., RNA sample and library evaluation) . Growth of the Genomics Core needs to occur in three broad areas: new equipment, tr aining and workshops, and participation in grants for instrument acquisition and technology development . We would like to expand our services to include more DNA preparation and analysis instrumentation to better enable the diverse research on campus. Th ese instruments need not be expensive. For example, a precision liquid handler, which dispenses nanoliter volume s, would be useful for researchers to reduce sample preparation expenses and would only cost $30,000. We created a list of items to consider purchasing for the Core (see below). Currently, the Core houses many older or even obsolete instruments. These instruments need to be sold or removed to make space and increase funds to purchase ne w equipment. Secondly, new training and workshops need to be developed in coordination with PIs. The development of these training modules could focused on the needs of multiple or specific programs , especially when further adoption is anticipated . Finally, an area of expansion should be dedicated to more direct collaboration with researchers to help support the Core. Rather than just generating revenue from service fees only, Cores should be partners in research . This may be a mechanism to aid in new equipment purchases by providing a location to house broadly us ed equipment while distributing the maintenance and supply costs. Items being considered for purchase: 1. Bioptic Qsep 100 2. Cellink MinION or Flongle 4. GenapSys Sequencer 5. Plate Centrifuge 6. Typhoon 7. E-gel - previous one w as stolen Nov. 2019 8. 384 qPCR 9. Qiacube (sp) 10. Computer upgrade for 3730 computer Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 20 In addition, a number of CEPCEB faculty wish to use single cell sequencing technology in their researcher. The Genomics Core would welcome an instrument, such as a 10xGenomics platform for single cell sequencing , as lon g as the purchase included several years of a service contract. Due to the nature of this technology, it is not feasible for researchers to transport materials from the south side of campus to MRB, where there is a 10x Genomics instrument. This year, three faculty members , Bailey -Serres (BPSC) , Monosalva (Plant Pathology and Microbiol ogy) and Dillman (Nematology), were unable to submit an instrument grant proposal for single cell sequencing because of necessary lack of campus support for a service contract. We understand this was due to budgetary constraints associated with COVID -19. It is desirable for the Core to be able to support such initiatives, as an instrument such as this would provide a new revenue stream. The Genomics Core previously had a $106 ,875 deficit at the start of the fiscal year. Despite COVID -19, the Core still greatly exceeded estimates by generating $470,826 of revenue, increasing efficiency towards supplies, and closely monitoring expenses ($345,763), along with appropriate budget reallocations. As of the end of FY20, the Genomics Core is officially out FY20 Carryforward: $18,187 Kirkwood, Anil Bhatia, Manhoi Hur, & Alyssa Vollaro The new Metabolomics & Lipidomics Core at IIGB provides cutting edge UPLC -MS instrumentation and sample preparation equipment to support untargeted and targeted metabolomics platforms as well as small molecule quantitation. Cu rrently, the facility houses two UPLC -Q-TOF MS (one w/ ion mobility), one triple quadrupole LC -MS system, and one GC -MS system with headspace sampling capabilities. The Core's services continue to expand throughout the campus, and UCR faculty have incorporated Metabolomics & Lipidomics Core data analysis in their publications, which range from Nature Communications to the Journal of Cell Biology . The full list of publ ications is available to view in the Metabolomics website . Additionally, the following grants have recently been submitted listing the core and its experts as a necessary componen t for the research objectives : PI Date Requested Additional Information Polly Campbell Jul-20 NIH R21 Emma Gachomo Jun-20 Due in 2.5 weeks Emma Wilson May -20 R01 Changcheng Zhou Mar-20 For drug measurement Lipidomics The Core will continue to progress and evolve by adding new services to meet the current needs of the researchers, such as 13C tracer analysis and targeted quantitation of new metabolites. The recently acquired GC -MS system will be installed next fiscal ye ar (by the end of July 2020), which will expand our Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 21 overall capabilities and meet the needs of researchers interested in neutral sugar metabolism. Coupled with headspace technology, the GC -MS will progressively increase the capacity for detecting volatile compounds in solid and liquid samples , and the system's temperature controlled auto sampler will offer unparalleled versatility, ease of use, and potential for online derivatization. Longer term, we hope we can bring MS imaging to the campus; however, thi s would require significant investment. The Metabolomics Core achieved $128,219 in revenue, incurred $50,884 in expenses, and had a carry forward of $66,717 from FY19. Much of the carry forward is earmarked towards staff salaries, instruments, and service contracts for the upcoming fiscal year. Metabolomics FY20 Carry forward : $144,052 Proteomics Core Core Personnel : Nathan Hendricks The Proteomics Core at IIGB has a series of instruments for protein separation, sample preparation, and mass spectrometry analyses and houses a LTQ -Orbitrap Fusion, electrophoresis equipment, tissue homogenizer, and a GelFree 8000 protein separation system. The facility has an upgraded Q -TOF Premier technologies including continuous expression scanning, ultra - performance liqu id chromatography (UPLC) with non -splitting direct nano -flow, and more advanced data processing software to perform large -scale quantitative proteomics analyses with increased sensitivity and sequence coverage. With the support of an NIH S10 instrument gra nt, a highly advanced Orbitrap Fusion MS system has been added to the facility to elevate its analytical capability and sensitivity to an unprecedented level. The Orbitrap Fusion features three fragmentation technologies including ETD, HCD, and CID. It is highly suitable for studies of protein post -translational modification such as phosphorylation and glycosylation. Its ultra -high resolution also allows characterization of intact proteins through top - down approaches. Low abundance proteins from limited bio logical samples can be readily detected with its sub -femtomole level detection sensitivity. Combined with a two -dimension nanoUPLC system, the Orbitrap Fusion can routinely perform MudPIT analysis for highly complex biological samples both qualitatively an d quantitatively. This past fiscal year, the Proteomics Core has focused on implementing TMT -based quantitative labeling as a service, as well as participating in the UCR Med School Retreat for advertising Core services. Currently, the number of services rendered will reach a relatively low cap due to the time consuming sample prep, which also limits time for other activities within the Core (developing new services, outreach, workshops), all of which have been postponed due to staff capacity. It would also be greatly beneficial to have service contracts for the instrumentation, but these mostly exceed last year's annual budget. It is foreseeable to expect occasional periods of downtime that could probably be greatly reduced in duration with the co ntracts. The main obstacles we are currently facing are due to a need for more personnel trained to accommodate sample preparation and analysis needs, along with allocating funding to afford service contracts for instrumentation. Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 22 The Proteomics Core faced a delayed start to several new services introduced this fiscal year due to necessary instrument repairs. The Core earned $5,934 in revenue, incurred $7,560 in expenses , and had a carry forward of $46,229 from FY19 that will go towards a five -year service c ontract. Proteomics Core FY20 Carry forward : $44,602 Bioinformatics Core The Bioinformatics Core services have been temporarily halted until a new Bioinformatics Programmer can be hired. Please see the Academic Recruitments section for more information regarding the search. Bioinformat ics Core FY20 Carry forward : $28,249 The High -Performance Computing Center Originally part of the Bioinformatics Core, the High -Performance Computing Center (HPCC) was spun -off to RED in fiscal year 2018 (July 2017) . IIGB continues to harness the resources of its state -of-the-art research -computing infrastructure and training , accessible to all UCR researchers and affiliates at a low cost. The HPCC includes over 4,500 CPU cores (40% Intel, 60% AMD), 512- 1024GB RAM per node. It also houses separate storage space for faculty with greater needs. The HPCC provides access to > 1000 software tools, packages and community databases are available. Chemical S creening Facilities Natasha Raikhel and Julia Bailey -Serres assembled these facilities through Raikhel's initial complement and the NSF ChemGen IGERT grant to CEPCEB . The chemical libraries are stored in - 20 C freezers. The Life Chem (17K compounds) and M icrosource Spectrum (2,250 compounds) libraries are in their original plates alongside five sets of aliquoted plates to minimize contamination and freeze thaw cycles. For high throughput screens, we have two small Bio Mek Precision 2000 liquid -handling rob ots for clean work . These may not be operable but the Genomics Core Opentrons OT -2 platform could perform a similar function . There is also a Beckman Coulter Biomek FX double bridge fluid -handling robot with Cytomat hotel, for library management and distri bution (currently under the Imaging Core). Additional equipment includes a Percival Arabidopsis growth chamber, an -80C freezer . Additional equipment in support of screening includes plate readers (Promega Glomax Multi+; Wallac Victor 2) , which provide 96 384 well screening by luminescence, UV fluorescence or absorbance with heating/shaking if needed. The BioMeck Precision 2000 and the Victor 2 mentioned are currently under the Imaging Core, David Carter and Matt Collin agreed to move these to the Genomics Core in July 2019, but at the time there were challenges with the new sales and service contracts. This move should take place. For microscopy -based screening, the Microscopy Core houses a fully automated white -light confocal imaging workstation (BD Pathway HT). This microscope is capable of automated imaging from 96 well or 384 well plates including autofocus a nd image capture and are also capable of liquid handling and basic image analysis. There is also a Stanford Photonics Onyx luminescence imager with mouse handling capability (warm pad and anesthetic manifold). These instrument s are part of the Imaging Core , now under STEM Cell Center umbrella. Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 23 The Bioinformatics Core , more specifically Thomas Girke, also developed a comprehensive screening database known as Chemmine (http://chemminedb.ucr.edu/) to maintain compound data sources as well as links to Chemmin e Tools. Microscopy Core Core Personnel: David Carter The CEPCEB Microscopy (Imaging) Core was moved to the direction of the STEM Cell Center at the start of this fiscal year, and Prudence Talbot now supervises Academic Coordinator David Carter . The decis ion were made without input from IIGB Director or more importantly from CEPCEB Director Professor Bail ey- Serres , who was one of the founders and PI of a key grant that funded this fac ility. Furthermore, neither IIGB nor CEPCEB were privy to information about the management of this core in FY19. The computer access and financials were transferred to Prue Talbot per the request of the CNAS. CEPCEB notes that CNAS assigned the salary and benefit allocation of David Carter to STEM in FY20 . The Microscopy Core has five confocal microscopes, including a pair of state -of-the-art Zeiss 880 Airyscan Fast instruments, one inverted and the other upright. These were funded in large part by an HHMI grant to Xuemei Chen (BPS C) and a NIH instrumentation grant spearheaded by Meng Chen (BPSC). The inverted system has a climate -controlled incubator for live animal cell work with temperature, humidity and CO 2 level control. It also has a 60mW 355nm UV laser for imaging and photoch emistry experiments, and an ELYRA PALM scan head for 3D two -color super -resolution imaging at 20x20x50nm. A Keyence BZ -X710 all -in-one inverted microscope provides fluorescence and bright field imaging, with time lapse, stitching, and extended depth imagi ng. A user -friendly Leica SP5 confocal system with nine laser lines and five confocal detectors and a BD Pathway HT system, which gives camera- based quantitation or automated and visual imaging of confocal samples, are also available. Imaris Bitplane softw are is used for 3D image rendering and analysis. Other microscopy core equipment include a Hitachi TM-1000 environmental SEM with sputter coater and critical point dryer; an Ultracut T ultramicrotome with cryosectioning system for EM immunolocalization stu dies (Leica EM FCS); a fluorescence dissection stereo microscope (Leica MZIII) with a Spot Pursuit 4Mpixel camera for fluorescence and color imaging; a cryostat for rapid sectioning of frozen tissue at 5 to 300 microns (Hacker Bright); a microtome for sectioning wax or plastic embedded samples (Hacker 5030); an oscillating tissue slicer (EMS5000); a particle gun for inserting DNA into living tissue (BioRad PDS1000/HE Hepta); and a fluorescence microplate reader (Wallac Victor 2) (part of the Chemical Genomi cs Instrumentation) . For macro imaging, a Nikon Multiphot with a retail DSLR camera is used for bright field and a Stanford Photonics Onyx Dark Box for luminescence, with optional LED light engines and filters for fluorescence. Finally, there is a Biomek F Xp fluid -handling robot for managing a chemical library, using 50nl or 300nl pin tools for direct dispensing from library to assay plate (also part of the Chemical Genomics Instrumentation that should be assigned to the Genomics Core) . The Imaging Core instrumentation remains under IIGB , as many of them , including the state -of-the-art Zeiss 880 microscope were purchased through NIH funded supplemental grants and other award s to the above aforementioned faculty members. The move of this core to STEM Cell Center without consultation, has reduced the overall faculty's enthusiasm for addit ional NIH - or NSF -funded application s aimed at purchasing other state -of-the-art imaging equipment instrumental for successful grant applications across campus, and tea ching/research endeavors .

Bailey -Serres also reviewed a publication in the 150th anniversary issue of Nature : Challenges and progress in the application of genetic strategies to enhance crop yields Chen, Xuemei The lab initiated a new research direction to understand the mechanisms and functions of RNA modifications. One major area in this new direction is the capping of RNAs by metabolites. In this period, they identified and studied a decapping protein that rem oves the RNA NAD+ cap. Eulgem, Thomas In collaboration with Dr. Phil Roberts, the lab developed a new Arabidopsis -based model pathosystem to uncover plant immune responses against the detrimental fungal root pathogen Macrophomia phaseolina. A peer -reviewed manuscript in Nature . In collaboration with CIDVR Direc tor Dr. Karine Le Roch, the lab uncovered a novel mechanism that balances the metabolic cost of plant immune responses and plant fitness -related processes . Eulgem and Le Roch as co -corresponding authors on a new manuscript that has just been accepted for p ublication by PLOS Genetics . Gonehal, modeling efforts in integrating transcriptional regulation, signaling and growth in multilayered shoot apical meristem stem cell niche is yielding quantitative insights into the layer specific regulation of nuclear retention, export, and concent ration -dependent stabilization in regulating transcription factor gradients. The first piece of work is in this new direction is currently under review in Nature Communications . Haga - Yamanaka, Sachiko In collaboration with Dr. Theodore Garland in the Department of EEOB , the labs demonstrated that VNO -mediated signals regulate voluntary wheel running activity. They successfully obtained robust data showing that cat saliva induces freezing behavior, and the signal is received and processed by the VNO. In collaboration with Dr. Naoki Yamanaka in the Department of Entomology , the labs demonstrated that the insect steroid hormone ecdysone requires a membrane transporter to enter its target cells. They obtained critical results suggesting that human importer s are also required for cellular uptake of human steroid hormones. Jia, Zhenyu (Arthur) The Jia lab started a USDA funded project to analyze multi -omic data of the citrus variety collection to identify genetic determinants of agronomic traits , as well as a USDA/CDFA project to develop strategies to increase marketable yield of pomegranate in California and Florida. Jiang, Tao They developed efficient algorithms for predicting isoform functions from RNA -Seq and genomic sequence s, quantifying the functional impact of noncoding using a multi - task Bayesian neural network, as well as several deep learning models for predicting drug -target interactions, RNA secondary structures and single -cell ATAC -seq data analysis. Julian, Ryan The Julian lab is pursuing a novel hypothesis about the underlying cause of Alzheimer's disease. A full list of press coverage associated with this research can be found at ACS Publications . Institute for Integrative Genome Biology Fiscal Year 2019- 20 52 Maduro, Morris Maduro started a new phase in his studies of early development in the nematode C. elegans and related species. A report was published in G3 showing his analysis, and further research would benefit from IIGB's Bioinformatics Core towards a future NSF grant proposal. Stajich, Jason Stajich's lab initiated two projects using IIGB's Metabolomics Core to study metabolites produced by microbes from desert environments and are also heavy users of HPCC. Their work focuses on extreme environments to study microbial diversity in Mojave Desert and Antarctica, population genomics, especially on pathogens, and fungal evolution, phylogenetics using whole genome and metagenomic sequencing. Rasmussen, Carolyn The lab discovered the TANGLED1 protein, which is a mystery of plant cell growth that could lead to bigger crops and better yields. Van Norman, Jaimie The lab studied the effects of turning off the IRK gene in Arabidopsis, which could be key so saving crops endangered by extreme weather Walling, Linda The first papers on cassava -whitefly interactions were published. A new grant to make Glassy -winged sharper shoot mutants was funded (co -PI, Atkinson and Redak). The lab had major advances in understanding the molecular basis of LAP -A function in wound signaling (three papers in progress), GWSS CRIPSR -Cas9 technologies were established, and proof that the white gene mutants in GWSS are lethal ; first insights into resistance response of cassava to whitefly (2 published and 1 in draft). Yamanaka, Naoki The Yamanaka lab expanded their work on the steroid hormone transporter in insects and found that the transporter is required in the fruit fly blood -brain barrier (BBB) to incorporate steroid hormones into the brain.
