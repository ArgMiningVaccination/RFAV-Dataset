However, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the concept of 'spirituality' refers to a more holistic view of life - in particular one's link with the land, sea and air. Consequently, this relationship confirms one's identity and place as an Aboriginal person and or a Torres Strait Islander person. There are no words in English to appropriately describe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander spirituality. The term 'Dreaming' has been associated with Aboriginal spirituality but does not adequately reflect its complexity or the fact that the 'Dreaming' permeates every aspect of Aboriginal cultures and societies. 'Dreamings' will vary from group to group. For Torres Strait Islanders, terms such as 'Before, Before time'; 'Before time'; 'Kulai tonar'; and 'Zogo time' are markers that identify the time prior to contact and the introduction of religion into the Torres Strait Islands. Like the Aboriginal Dreamings, Creation Stories or Legends from the Torres Strait Islands provide a basis for identity. In the 2021 Census, 7,887 people were recorded as practising Australian Aboriginal traditional religions. Northern Territory had the highest number of people recorded as practising Aboriginal traditional religions (3,437), followed by New South Wales (1422), Western Australia (1096) and Queensland (979).
