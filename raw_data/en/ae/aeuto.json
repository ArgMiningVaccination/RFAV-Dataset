Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices Customer Reviews A regular must-listen This podcast is like sitting down with your very smart friend, digging into the issues (good, bad and ugly) over a cup of coffee, and walking away a better person for it. Lynzy and her guests never disappoint. Low sexual desire episode was amazing! I always love Lynzy's podcast episodes, but this one was one of my favorites! It actually made me stop and think on several occasions about some of the simple points that Thea made that seem so obvious but we generally never take into consideration. I feel as if I was raised to think, \"sex is bad\" in my Christian upbringing and it's something to only be talked about behind closed doors. Also, Thea hit the nail on the head when she talked about how men connect with sex and women generally connect by communicating to feel close and only then would they want to move forward with having sex. It just made me feel seen and understood and that that was a \"normal\" experience for many women. Thank you for this episode! Lynzy I used to follow and adore Lynzy on Instagram until she completely shut down anyone who questioned the Covid Vaccine. I wonder if she feels badly that so many people have suffered negative side effects and \"sudden death\" is on the rise. Maybe a change of heart and an apology to those families who lost loved ones from vaccine injuries would be a start. "}
