SYNAGIS [si-nah-jis] helps protect babies from RSV through virus-blocking antibodies. SYNAGIS is not a vaccine\u2014it's an injection given once a month throughout RSV season, which usually starts in the fall and continues into spring. The exact timing of RSV varies by location. SYNAGIS gives babies who are born prematurely (at or before 35 weeks, and who are 6 months of age or less at the beginning of RSV season) the virus-blocking antibodies they lack, helping protect their vulnerable lungs from RSV. SYNAGIS can help protect children with certain lung or heart conditions who are at high risk for severe RSV disease. Children with BPD/CLDP or HS-CHD are more likely to be hospitalized with an RSV infection than those without these conditions. Remember, SYNAGIS is not a vaccine. Children can still get severe RSV disease despite receiving SYNAGIS. If your child has an RSV infection, make sure they continue to get their monthly injections throughout the RSV season\u2014because babies can get RSV more than once. BPD/CLDP stands for bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic lung disease of prematurity. HS-CHD stands for hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. Each dose of SYNAGIS helps protect your child from severe RSV disease for about a month. SYNAGIS should be given to high-risk babies every 28-30 days during RSV season. Talk to your doctor about a dosing schedule appropriate for your area. It's important that babies at high risk for severe RSV disease get every injection of SYNAGIS on time throughout the RSV season.
