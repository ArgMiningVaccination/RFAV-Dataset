Bryers Bioengineering Plasmid DNA (pDNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines hold significant potential as versatile, safe, and cost -effective technologies for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. However, clinical applications are currently limited by poor immunogenicity attributable to limitations in nucleic acid delivery efficacy . Synthetic nonviral delivery vectors represent a promising approach to improving vaccine potency through the enhancement of gene transfection. This dissertation describes the development of multifunctional block copolymers as delivery platforms for nucleic acid vaccines. Polymers were synthesized via reversible addition - fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, a technique enabling the facile production of well-defined block copolymers with complex architectures. First, a series of block copolymers composed of discrete cationic, endosomolytic, and hydrophilic segments was evaluated for mRNA delivery. Polymer designs producing highly stable mRNA polyplexes were associated with high in vitro transfection efficienci es and successfully deliver ed antigen - encoding mRNA to dendritic cells (DCs) for T cell activation. Second, glycopolymer micelles incorporating a n endosomolytic core and mannosylated corona for DC targeting were assessed for pDNA vaccine delivery efficacy in mice. Compared to uncomplexed pDNA and untargeted micelles, m annosylated micelles exhibited enhanced uptake by DCs in lymph nodes and elicited increased antigen -specific antibody responses . Overall, these findings demonstrate the potential of multifu nctional RAFT -based polymers for improving the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics for vaccination strategies. i Table of Contents List of Figures ................................ ................................ ................................

Introduction The first demonstration of nucleic acid vaccination was described in 1992, when Tang et al . reported that biolistic delivery of antigen -encoding plasmid DNA ( pDNA ) into the skin of elicited antigen -specific antibody responses [1]. Subsequently , Ulmer et al . observed that intramuscular d elivery of pDNA encoding influenza A nucleoprotein conferred protection against viral challenge s in mice, demonstrating that pDNA vaccines could generate viral antigens for immune presentation without the limitations of direct peptide delivery and viral ve ctors [2]. Research efforts in the following decades have proven that nucleic acid vaccines are safe, versatile, cost -efficient, and capable of eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses similar to those induced by live attenuated vaccines [3-5]. Both pDNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) have been explored for prophylactic vaccination again st a wide variety of pathogens ( e.g. HIV, influenza virus, anthrax, malarial parasites) , as well as for therapeutic anti -cancer v accination [3,4,6] . However, the performance of these vaccines in human clinical trial s has thus far not matched their success in preclinical animal model s, underscoring the need for the development of more potent vaccine technologies. This chapter provides a review of the immunology of nucleic acid vaccines, followed by a brief summary of pDNA and mRNA vaccines , with a focus on mRNA as an emerging alternative to pDNA for immunotherapies. The final section gives an overview of the approach taken in this 2 work for enhancing vaccine potency: developing synthetic polymer carrier systems engineered to improve the intrace llular delivery efficacy of nucleic acid therapeutics . 2. Immunology of nucleic acid vaccines The induction of an antigen -specific immune response requires that vaccine antigens be processed by professional antigen -presenting cells (APCs) for loading onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and presentation to T cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the primary APCs invo lved in the initiation of adaptive immunity and are important target s for vaccination strategies [7]. Immature DCs are highly endocytic cells that survey peripheral tissues for antigens. In the abs ence of foreign pathogens, presentation of environmental and self antigens induces tolerance [8]. When exposed to maturation s timuli , such as microbial products and inflammatory cytokines, DCs undergo maturation and migrate to the T cell regions of lymphoid organs to activate T cell -mediated immunity. The origin of the antigen influences the subsequent immune response (Figure 1.1) [9]. Endogenous antigens are presented on MHC I molecules for recognition by CD8+ T cells for initiation of cell -mediated immunity . Exogenous antigens are presented on MHC II molecule s for recognition by CD4+ T cells , which then activate B cells for the initiation of humoral immunity. These two pathways are not entirely distinct, as the \"cross -presentation\" mechanism in DCs allows for the presentation of exogenous antigens on MHC I mo lecules, and some CD4+ helper T cell subset s play a role in stimulating cellular immunity. Depending on the specific application, optimal vaccine efficacy may require activation of both cell-mediated and humoral immu ne responses. 3 Figure 1.1. Pathways of the adaptive immune response . Peptide and protein vaccines directly provide exogenous antigens for uptake by DC s, which biases the resultant responses towards MHC II presentation and antibody -mediated immunity . In contrast, n ucleic acid vaccines generate endogenous antigens through the transfection of local host cells , which more closely mimics the activity of live pathog ens and enables these vaccines to induce both cellular and humoral mmunity [5]. There are two potentia l mechanisms by which these host-expressed antigens are introduced into DCs for processing : (1) direct transfection of DCs and (2) transfection of bystander cells (e.g. keratinocytes, myocytes, fibroblasts) which express antigens for subsequent capture by DCs [5,10] . Current evidence suggests that both pathways can contribute to immunity , although their relative importance may be influenced by the route of administration (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal) [5,11,12] . 4 3. pDNA vaccines The seminal work of Wolff et al. in 1990 established that intramuscular delivery of naked pDNA could generate gene expr ession in local myocytes [13]. As di scussed in the Introduction, this study was followed by reports from Tang et al . [1] and Ulmer et al. [2] demonstrating that protein expression from injected pDNA elicited protective antigen -specific immune responses . Since then, pDNA vaccines have been extensively evaluated in animal mode ls and human clinical trials , most commonly for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases [3]. While pDNA therapies have been documented to be safe and well tolerated , the mag nitude of the immune response elicited by these vaccines in humans is thus far insufficient for protective or therapeutic efficacy [4]. Nevertheless, the recent approval of three pDNA vaccines for veterinary use - one against viral infection in horses [14], one against viral infection in fish [15], and a melanoma treatment for dogs [16] - is an encouraging advancement that further validates the clinical potential of this technology. Recent efforts in the field of pDNA vaccination have focused on improving vaccine potency through a variety of approaches. These include: (1) co -delivery of plasmids encoding cytokines, chemokines, molecules as vaccine adjuvants [17], (2) h eterologous immunization strategies utilizing a pDNA vaccine for priming followed by a recombinant viral or protein b oost [18], (3) next -generation delivery formats such as electroporation and gene gun [19], and (4) formulating pDNA with carrier systems , such as liposomes, polymers, and nanoparticles , in order to improve delivery characteristics and gene transfection efficiency [20,21] . 5 4. mRNA vaccines 4.1. Advantages of mRNA as a gene therapeutic Eukaryotic mature mRNA is a linear, single -stranded molecule composed of five major components: the 5' cap (m7GpppN, where N is any nucleotide), a 5' untranslated region (UTR), an open reading frame, a 3' UTR, and a poly(A) tail consisting of 100 -250 adenosine residues [22]. mRNAs used for vaccination typical ly range from 100-10,000 bases in length [6], and are produced by in vitr o transcription from a pDNA template. One of the primary advantages of mRNA compared to pDNA is that mRNA does not require nuclear entry for its activity, resulting in significantly higher and faster levels of gene expression [22,23] . N uclear entry i s a formidable barrier to pDNA transfection - some studies have estimated th at less than 1% of pDNA delivered to the cytoplasm reaches the nucleus [24,25] - and the mechanisms by which this process occurs for synthetic delivery systems are extremely poorly characterized [26]. This is particularly significant for gene delivery to slow ly- or non - dividing mammalian cells, whose relative intransigence to pDNA transfection has been attributed to the unavailability of passive nuclear import via the mitotically induced breakdown of the nuclear envelope [27-29]. In co ntrast, mRNA -based gene therapies render the nuclear entry barrier irrelevant, and thus represent a promising alternative to pDNA for delivery to hard -to- transfect cell types. In terms of safety , mRNA is preferable to pDNA for clinical applications since mRNA cannot integrate into the host genome, thus eliminating the risk of insertional mutagenesis , and is only transiently expressed. While the usage of mRNA for long -term gene therapies is limited due to 6 this short -term expression profile , mRNA is extremely suitable for applications where only transient production of the gene product is required. In the case of prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination strategies, multiple administrations of mRNA may be needed, but this is a perfectly feasible appro ach given t he relative facility , efficiency, and cost -effectiveness of producing in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP) guidelines [30]. 4.2. Applications of mRNA vaccination Administration of mRNA for in vivo protein expression was also first demonstrated by Wolff et al. in their seminal 1990 report [13]. In 1993, successful mRNA vaccination was first reported by Martinon et al., who observed the induction of an antigen -specific cytotoxic T cell response in mice following immunization with liposome -entrapped mRNA [31]. Boczkowski et 1996 that mRNA -transfected DCs could be used to generate protective antitumor immune responses [32]. Despite these successes, the use of mRNA for vaccination ha s lagged behind plasmid pDNA largely because mRNA was long considered to be too unstable for clinical applications. However , mRNA is now increasingly being recognized as a promising alternative to pDNA in gene therapy strategies. Thus far, mRNA has bee n predominantly investigated as a gene vaccination agent for cancer immunotherapy , with the vast majority of these studies transfected with mRNA ex vivo [6,33 -38]. potent ial for vaccination with both predefined tumor antigens or patient -specific antigenic mixtures in the form of tumor -derived mRNA, with the latter option being particularly useful for situations where the optimal antigenic targets are 7 unknown [35]. Despite the relative instability of unprotected mRNA, early phase clinical studies have successfully utilized passive transfection of DCs with naked mRNA [39-46] or direct injection of naked mRNA [47,48] to induce antitumor immune responses . Vaccine e fficacy in clinical trials has also been observed using DCs transfected by electroporation [49-53] and lipofection [54]. In general, mRNA vaccination treatments have been well tolerated by patients with no major toxicity observed. mRNA vaccination has also been explored in preclinical studies for other immunotherapy applications. The use of mRNA vaccines and mRNA -transfected DC vaccines as anti -infective immunotherapies has been reported in murine models using influenza virus [31,55] , virus C type 16 [58], and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [59]. Additionally, Roesler et al . recently reported the use of mRNA delivered by direct injection in mice for preventative vaccination against type I allergies [60]. 5. Designing polymer vehicles for nucleic acid vaccine delivery The primary disadvantage of nucleic acid vaccination is that vaccine efficacy is dependent upon gene transfection : low levels of antigen expression reduce the potency of the subsequent immune responses [61]. To overcome this limitation, many research efforts have focused on developing delivery technologies for improving the transfection efficiency of nucleic acid vaccines. Synthetic nonviral vectors are highly versat ile and avoid the safety concerns associated with viral delivery, but are typically less efficient. To successfully deliver pDNA or mRNA for cellular expression, delivery vehicles must navigate a wide variety of extracellular and intracellular 8 barriers (Figure 1.2) [26]. Viruses have evolved numerous functionalities to surmount each of these obstacles and mediate highly efficient gene transduction. In contrast, the relatively low transfection efficiencies obtained with synthetic carriers can be attributed to the fact that these systems typically only address a subset of these barriers . Figure 1.2 . Major steps in polymer -mediated intracellular gene delivery . 5.1. Navigating the extracellular space The extracellular milieu contains nucleases that rapidly degrade any unprotected nucleic acids. This is a particularly significant issue for mRNA, since it is very labile to degradation by ubiquitous acids into a particulate \"polyplex\" via electrostatic interactions. Cationic condensation also enhances cellular uptake of nucleic acids by compacting nucleic acids into a 9 size range favorable for endocytosis and facilitating association with anionic cellular membranes [26,62] . However, the cationic surface charge associated with polyplexes can cause problems in vivo with regards to colloidal instability, aggregation, and toxicity , due to undesirable interactions with negatively charged biomacrom olecules such as serum proteins, cellular blood components, complement factors, and cell surface glycosaminoglycans [63]. Such interactions may also destabilize polyplexes, causing premature extracellular release of the nucleic acid [63,64] . Many delivery systems incorporate neutral such poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA), and various oligosaccharides that reduce these interactions and shield the cationic surface charge vi a the creation of a steric barrier [26,64] . 5.2. Cell -specific targeting Although APCs can internalize polyplexes through the nonspecific processes of macropinocytosis and phagocytosis, additional enhancement of uptake efficiency can be achieved through the use of cell -specific targeting ligands to direct polyplexes into the receptor - mediated endocyti c pathway. Targeting strategies typically involve chemically modifying delivery vectors with targeting moieties such as carbohydrates, small molecules, peptides, and antibodies [26]. For vaccines , commonly targeted DC receptors include the macrophage mannose receptor (MMR , described i n greater detail in Chapter 5 ), DEC -205, DC-SIGN, and the Fc receptors [65,66] endolysosomal polyplexes are entrapped in early endosomes, which acidify, into late endosomes, and fuse with lysosomes containing degradative enzymes (Figure 1.3 ) [67,68] . To avoid destruction of the nuclei c acid cargo, polyplexes must escape from entrapment in endolysosomal compartments. While endosomal escape remains a formidable obstacle for synthetic gene delivery vectors [26], viruses and intrace llular pathogens have evolved very effective escape mechanisms that manipulate the intracellular trafficking pathway [68]. For instance, in the acidic endolysosomal environment , the viral protein hemagglutinin undergo es a conformational change from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic form that can fuse with and disrupt membrane lipid bilayers [69]. Figure 1.3. Acidifying pH gradient of the endolysosomal trafficking pathway. Alternatively, synthetic polymer systems that exhibit high buffer ing capacities such as PEI are hypothesized to achieve cytosolic delivery through the proton sponge effect, in which an influx of counterions and water ruptures the endosomal vesicle through an increase in osmotic pressure [70]. More recently, pH -responsive polymer systems that mimic the ability of viral proteins to 11 unde rgo conformational changes to a hydrophobic, endosomolytic state have been reported [71,72] , and are described in greater detail in Chapter 2. 5.4. Polyplex unpackaging and gene expression Successful gene expression requires that the nucleic acid ultimately be released from the condensing polymer . It remains unclear at what point in the intracellular delivery process this polyplex unpackaging occurs, although there is some evidence that negatively -charged biomacromolecules resident i n the cytosolic space may facilitate decomplexation [73-75]. Extremely stable polymer -nucleic acid interactions may cause inefficient nucleic aci d unpack aging from the polyplex , leading to reduced transfection efficienc ies [76]. Common approaches to facilitating polyplex unpackaging include reducing the overall cationic charge , using lower molecular weight polyc ations, using biodegradable or reducible polymer systems, and incorporating neutral hydrophilic segments [26,77] . However , reducing the stability of nucleic acid binding may conversely lead to premature polyplex dissociation in the extracellular space , so polymer ic gene carriers must be carefully designed to enable both protection from degradation and timely intracellular release . Following decomplexation, mRNA translation takes place in the cytosol, whereas pDNA must be trafficked into the nucleus for transcription to occur . As previously discussed, elimi nation of the nuclear localization requirement is a significant advantage of mRNA transfection, since the nuclear transport of pDNA is a poorly characterized process that remains a significant barrier to efficient pDNA transfection. While the use of pepti des containing nuclear localization signals 12 has been explored as a means of overcoming this barrier, there is significant controversy over the effectiveness of this approach [78,79] . 5.5. Block copolyme rs as multifunctional gene delivery vectors An ideal gene carrier system would incorporate multiple functionalities , each engineered to address a specific delivery barrier. Block copolymer vectors satisfy this requirement by allowing for the modular incorporation of discrete functional polymer segments. For instance, various di-, tri-, and pentablock copolymer architectures consisting of alternating cationic blocks , for nucleic acid condensation , and neutral hydrophilic blocks , for conferring polyplex stability and biocompatibility , have been developed for gene delivery [80]. Studies performed with t hese systems have underscored the observation that delivery vector development frequently involves balancing competing design requirements: the improved stability and reduced cytotoxicity associated with these block copolymer vectors often comes at the cost of lower transfe ction efficienc ies compared to cationic homopolymers intracellular trafficking [81]. Amphiphilic block copolymers composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments that self - assemble into micellar structures have also received significant research attention in the context of delivery vector development [82,83] . Gary et al. reported that amphiphilic triblock n-butyl acryla te) (PnBA) exhibited superior in vitro and in vivo small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) delivery characteristics compared to non-micellar PEG and PEG -pDMAEMA carriers, and hypothesized that the 13 \"micelleplexes\" were directed towards internalization and intracellular trafficking pathways more favorable for efficient transfection [84]. 5.6. Reversible additi on-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization The development of multifunctional polymer vectors requires excellent synthetic control over polymer compositi on and structure . Living free radical polymerization ( LRP) techniques such as stable free radical polymerization (SFRP), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) , and reversible addition -fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization enable the synthesis of well-defined block co polymers with predeter mined molecular weights, specific poly mer architectures , and narrow polydispersity indices (PDIs) , and are commonly used to synthesize vehicl es for drug and gene delivery [80,85] . These attributes also make LRP methodologies particularly suitable for studies that seek to systematically elucidate structure -function principles for rational gene carrier design. RAFT polymerization , first described in 1998 [86], exhibits several unique advantages in that it is applicable to a wide variety of vinyl monomers, does not require the use of toxic metallic catal ysts, and allows for facile functionalization of polymer chain ends . The RAFT mechanism utilizes a chain transfer agent (CTA ) which typically contains a thiocarbonylthio moiety reactive towards radical species (Figure 1.4 ). Uniform chain growth is achieved through a reversible chain transfer process between active propagating polymeric radical s and these thiocarbonylthio groups on dormant \"macroCTA\" chain s. Under the appropriate conditions, the polymerization molecular wei ght is controlled by the initial monomer to CTA ratio ([M] 0/[CTA] 0), allowing for the synthesis of polymer s with predetermined block sizes [83]. The \"living\" nature of the 14 polymer chain end enables the fabrication of more advanced multiblock architectures , while additional end group functionalities , such as targeting moieties and bioconjugation sites , can be incorporated through the use of appropriately modified CTAs [83]. RAFT techniques are amena ble to many monomers commonly used in the context of delivery applicatio [85]. Figure 1.4. RAFT polymerization methodology and potential polymer architectures. The activity of the CTA depends upon the properties of the radical leaving group, R, and the activating group, Z. 15 Chapter 2 Synthesis of multifunctional block copolymers for mRNA delivery Abstract This chapter describes the development, synthesis, and characterization of multifunctional block copolymer delivery vehicles for intracellular mRNA delivery . The overall polymer architecture incorporates three discrete polymer blocks with distinct functionalities: (1) a DMAEMA block for the cationic condensation of mRNA, (2) a PEGMA block for stabilization and biocompatibility , of diethylaminoethyl pH -triggered endosomal escape. RAFT polymerization was used to synthesize a polymer series that rationally varied block order and PEGMA block size. The resultant polymers assay. Successful was demonstrated by GPC traces indicating relatively unimodal molecular weight distributions with clear shifts to lower retention times. All synthesized polymers exhibited block sizes and compositio ns close to the targeted values. Polymers in aqueous sol ution formed approximately 22-36 nm micelles that were capable of disrupting cellular membranes at endosomal/lysosomal pH values, while remaining inert under physiological pH conditions . 16 1. Introduction While synthetic polymer systems have been widely explored for pDNA and siRNA delivery, there are relatively few reports of such systems being applied towards mRNA delivery. Previous findings have observed that commonly used polycations such as PEI [87-90], PLL [87,89] , and pDMAEMA [91] are typically less effective for mRNA delivery, although high transfection efficiencies have been reported with PEI in certain studies [91,92] . Improvements in mRNA delivery have been achie ved with modified polymer systems, including peptide - conjugated low molecular olymers [93]. Hybrid polymer -lipid delivery systems have also been developed, including ternary complexes of DOTAP and Block cop olymer systems allow for the modular incorporation of multiple functionalities into a single polymer structure and have been widely explored for gene delivery applications. Typical polymer architectures may include : (A) cationic segments for condensing nuc leic acids, (B) hydrophilic segments for enhancing stability and biocompatibility, and (C) pH-responsive segments capable of mediating escape . Various ABC -type triblock copolymer systems have been previously reported in the context of pDNA [98-104] and siRNA [105-107] transfection, but not y. 17 pDMAEMA and DMAEMA -based copolymers have received significant research attention for gene delivery applications [108-113]. pDMAEMA is a polycation capable of condensing nucleic acids via its tertiary amines, which are at physiological pH (pK a ~7.5) [114] . This interaction results in a compact particle that confers protection from nucleases and enhan ces cellular association via electrostatic interactions between the cationic polyplexes and negatively charged cellular membranes [26]. The facile synthesis of well-defined DMAEMA -based systems using LRP methodologies represents a significant advantage over other commonly used polycations such as PEI and PLL . However, further improve ments in the design of DMAEMA -based delivery systems are still needed in order to bring them into clinical relevance: high molecular weight pDMAEMA homopolymers have been observed to be extremely cytotoxic, while low molecular weight pDMAEMA does not media te efficient gene transfer [115,116] . RAFT techniques have been used to develop pH -sensitive amphiphilic block copolymer systems that achieve improved gene delivery efficiencies through the enhancement of endosomal escape capabilities . These systems mimic the conformational changes exhibited by viral fusogenic proteins and peptides in the acidic endol ysosomal environment . Convertine et al. reported of a diblock copolymer system for siRNA transfection composed of a DMAEMA and a propylacrylic acid (PAA), BMA , and DMAEMA [71]. pH - triggered protonation of PAA causes the diblock co polymer to transition into a hydrophobic, membrane -interactive state , enabling the cytosolic release of the carrier and its cargo. 18 Recently, Manganiello et al . reported a micellar diblock copolymer for pDNA delivery composed a acidic conditions induces a micelle to unimer transition that exposes hydrophobic BMA units that disrupt endosomal membranes . In the work reported here , this carrier system was modified into a triblock copolymer system with the addition of a hydrophilic PEGMA segment to enhance polyplex stability by steric shielding. RAFT polymerization was used to synthesize a polymer series that varied block ing order and PEGMA block size in order to investigate the effect of polymer architecture on delivery characteristics. 2. Experimental methods 2.1. Materials Chemicals were supplied by Sigma -Aldrich unless otherwise specified. DMAEMA, DEAEMA, and BMA were distilled prior to use. PEGMA (average M n = 300 Da) was passed through a basic alumina column prior to use. 2,2 -azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was recrystallized and 4,4 -azobis(4 -cyanopentanoic acid) were used received. 2.2. Synthesis of pDMAEMA macroCTA The RAFT polymerization of DMAEMA (6 g, 38 .2 mmol) was conducted in dioxane (9 g, 102 mmol) at 60 \u00b0C (40 wt% monomer to solvent) under a nitrogen atmosphere for 18 h using CTP (142 mg, 0.509 mmol) and V -501 (36 mg, 0.127 mmol) as the chain transfer agent (CTA) and 19 radical initiator, respectively. The initial monomer to CTA ratio ([M] 0/[CTA] 0) and the initial CTA to initiator ratio ([CTA] 0/[I] 0) were 75:1 and 4:1, respectively. resultant macroCTA was isolated by precipitation into pentane (x5) and dried overnight in vacuo . 2.3. Synthesis of pPEGMA macroCTA The RAFT polymerization PEGMA (2 g, 6.67 mmol) was conducted in dioxane (18 g, 204 mmol) at 60 \u00b0C (10 wt% monomer to solvent) under a nitrogen atmosphere for 18 h using CTP (29 mg, 0.103 mmol) and AIBN 65:1 and 10:1, respectively. The resultant macroCTA was isolated by precipitation and dried. 2.4. Synthesis of diblock copolymer DE DEAEMA (224 mg, 0.518 mmol) monomers fraction BMA) macroCTA (200 mg, 0.0173 mmol) dissolved in 8.47 mmol) (40 monomer and macroCTA to solvent) at a [M] 0/[CTA] 0 ratio of 100:1. The reaction was conducted at 60 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 18 h using V -501 (1.2 mg, 4.32 mol) with [CTA] 0/[I] 0 ratio 4:1, and the final polymer was isolated by precipitation and dried. 2.5. Synthesis of triblock copolymers monomer and 100:1 (DPE2), 150:1 (DPE3). Reactions were conducted at 60 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere using AIBN with [CTA] 0/[I] 0 ratio 10:1, and the resultant macroCTAs were isolated by precipitation and dried. T hese macroCTAs were used in the block copolymerization of DEAEMA and BMA at [M] 100:1 (DPE1, DPE2) or 175:1 (DPE3), with all other reaction conditions and purification procedures the same as previously described for polymer DE. 2.6. Synthesis of triblock copolymers PDE, PED Polymer PDE was synthe sized two -step procedure: (1) DMAEMA with [M] 0/[CTA] ratio 75:1, followed by (2) block copolymerization of DEAEMA and BMA from the resultant diblock macroCTA with [M] 0/[CTA] 0 ratio 100:1. was synthesized by: (1) block copolymerization of DEAEMA and BMA from a pPEGMA macroCTA with [M] 0/[CTA] 0 ratio 100:1, followed copolymerization from the diblock m acroCTA with [M] 0/[CTA] 0 ratio 75:1. All other conditions and procedures for the polymerizations of DMAEMA or DEAEMA -co-BMA were the same as previously described. 2.7. Chromatographic purification and preparation of polymer stock solutions Dried polymers were dissolved into ethanol followed by addition into Dulbecco's phosphate - buffered saline (DPBS) (10 vol% ethanol, 8 -12 mg/mL polymer), purified by chromatographic separation via a PD -10 desalting column (GE Healthcare), and lyophilized. Polymer stock solutions were prepared by redissolving lyophilized polymers into ethanol followed by addition into DPBS (2 vol% ethanol, 2 mg/mL polymer). 21 2.8. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy The 1H-NMR spectra of all dried macroCTA intermediates and final lyophilized polymers were acquired using a Bruker AV 500 at 10 -20 mg/mL polymer in CDCl 3. The monomer compositions of the DEAEMA -co-BMA \"E\" block were determined by the integration of the peaks described in Figure 2.2. 2.9. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) Molecular weights and polydisperity indices were determined using Tosoh SEC TSK -GEL R - 3000 and R -4000 columns connected in series to an Agilent 1200 series liquid chromatography system, Wyatt miniDAWN TREOS triple -angle MALS light scattering , Optilab - rEX refractive index detector. HPLC -grade DMF containing 0.1 wt% LiBr at 60 oC was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Polymer molecular weights were determined using dn/dc values calculated separately for each macroCTA and polymer. 2.10. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) characterization of polymer micelle size DLS measurements were conducted on a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Malvern) at a constant scattering angle of 173\u00b0 at 25 \u00b0C. Measurements for polymer micelles were conducted usin g 2 [117] . Briefly, polyme r solutions were incubated with red blood cells in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH values 22 of 7.4, 7.0, 6.6, 6.2, or 5.8. In order to normalize hemolytic activity to the total amount of endosomolytic units available per polymer, the concentration of e ach polymer solution was calculated such that the final mass concentration of the DEAEMA -co-BMA block was 20 g/mL. Triton X -100 (1% v/v in water) was used as a positive control. After 1 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the amount of released hemoglobin was measur ed via absorbance at 492 nm. 3. Results 3.1. RAFT -mediated polymer synthesis and characterization RAFT -mediated synthesis ( Scheme 2.1) was used to construct a series of block copolymers composed of DMAEMA, PEGMA, and copolymers DPE1, PDE, and PED were designed to investigate the effect of different block arrangements without altering the lengths of their constitutive blocks. Copolymer series DE, DPE1, DPE2, and DPE3 were designed to maintain the same block order while increasing the targeted size of the central PEGMA block: 0 g/mol (DE), 30,000 weights for the DMAEMA and DEAEMA -co-BMA blocks in all polymers were 10,000 g/mol and 15,000 g/mol, respectively, with a monomer feed ratio of 30% BMA in the DEAEMA -co-BMA block. GPC traces of the intermediate macroCTAs and final polymer showed relatively unimodal molecular weight distributions with clear shifts to lower retention times, indicating successful block copolymerization ( Figure 2.1 ). NMR analysis confirmed that the synthesized polymers exhibited all expected resonances and were free of residual monomers ( Figure 2.2 ). All 23 polymers exhibited narrow polydispersities (PDI 1.14 ) with block sizes and compositions close to the targeted values. Scheme 2.1.

DLS characterization of polymer micelles Polymers were further characterized by DLS for particle sizing analysis (Table 2.2). Molecularly dissolved polymers in solution formed particles 22 -36 nm in diameter, indicative of self-assembly into micelles. This behavior is consistent with previous observations in a similar diblock copolymer system [72]. Overall, polymer architecture did not appear to significantly influence polymer micelle formation, although micelle sizes for polymers in the D -P-E configuration appeared to increase slightly with increasing PEGMA block size. 27 Table 2.2.

Polymers were incubated with human red blood cells at pH values selected to mimic the acidifying gradient encountered as endocytosed material is trafficked to endosomal/lysosomal compartments ( Figure 2.3 ). All polymers minimal hemolytic activity under physiological conditions (< 2% hemolysis at pH 7.4), but transitioned sharply to high levels of hemolysis at lower pH values. Comparing the hemoly tic activities of PDE, PED, and DPE1 to assess the effect of block order on membrane destabilization activity, at pH 6.2, DPE1 and PDE achieved similar hemolysis levels of 83% and 88%, respectively, while PED exhibited only 52% hemolysis, suggesting that p lacing in the endosomolytic segment in the center of the polymer chain may interfere with its membrane -disruptive properties. Comparing the hemolysis levels at pH 6.2 exhibited DE (84%), size in the D -P-E configuration did not alter the hemolytic profile, with the exception of DPE3 which generated markedly higher levels of hemolysis than 28 the other three polymers. This finding suggests that sufficiently large PEGMA block lengths in the D-P-E arrangement may improve the pH -dependent membrane destabilization activity of these polymers. Figure 2.3. Hemolytic activity of polymers at 20 g/mL mass concentration of the DEAEMA - co-BMA block.

Discussion Here, the synthesis of a series of multifunctiona l triblock copolymers composed of (1) a DMAEMA block for cationic mRNA condensation, (2) a hydrophilic PEGMA block to provide polyplex stabilization, and (3) a DEAEMA -co-BMA block to enable pH -triggered endosomal escape is described . Several aspects of th is polymer series represent novel approaches to delivery vector development. First, although multifunctional ABC -type triblock copolymer systems have been previously investigated for pDNA and siRNA transfection, this is the first report of a triblock copo lymer developed specifically as an mRNA delivery vector. Second, 29 although DMAEMA, PEGMA, and DEAEMA -co-BMA have all been previously used in the context of intracellular delivery, this particular combination of polymers in a single block copolymer structur e has not been previously reported . Third, this is the first study utilizing an ABC -type triblock system that systematically examined all three possible unique block arrangements to determine the optimal architecture for efficient delivery. While some re ports on the effect of polymer architecture on polyplex properties and transfection activity are available [116,118,119] , block order has typically been overlooked as a potential experimental parameter. In this study, t he use of RAFT polymerization techniques enabled the facile synthesis of monodisperse polymers with different block arrangements and sizes. DLS analysis revealed that all polymers self -assembled into micelle structures in aqueous solution. Manganiello et al. previously observed in a similar polymer system that the hydrophobic DEAEMA -co-BMA segment is sequestered in the micelle core at physiological pH values, but becomes solvated at endosomal pH values provided that the block composition is 70% BMA [72]. Furthermore, this micelle to unimer structural transition correlates closely to membrane -disruptive activity. Consistent with this report, the monomer compositions of the DEAEMA -co-BMA block for the polymer series ranged from 31 -36% BMA, and all polymers demonstrated sharp pH -triggered transitions from inert to hemolytic states . Interestingly, the PED polymer displayed lower levels of peak hemolytic activity compared to DPE1 and PDE, which had e quivalent block sizes but differing block configurations. Hypothetically, sequestering the endosomolytic DEAEMA -co-BMA in the center of the polymer chain between two relatively hydrophilic blocks may have resulted in steric effects that reduced its ability to 30 interact with cellular membranes. Additional influences of polymer architecture on delivery performance are further discussed in Chapter 3. 5. Conclusions A series of multifunctional block copolymers composed of discrete DMAEMA, PEGMA, and DEAEMA -co-BMA segments were synthe sized by RAFT polymerization . The polymer series encompassed rational iterations on pol ymer block order and PEGMA block size. All polymers had low polydispersities (PDI 1.14), and molecular weights and compositions close to the targeted values. Polymers were observed to form micelles in aqueous solution and exhibited pH - dependent hemolyt ic activity indicative of their endosomal escape capabilitie s. Overall, the synthesized polymers have favorable characteristics for intracellular gene delive ry and are a promising platform for investigating the effects of distinct polymer architectures on transfection performance. 31 Chapter 3 In vitro evaluation of the biological activity of mRNA polyplexes Abstract This chapter describes the characterization of mRNA polyplexes formulated with multifunctional block copolymers , and the evaluation of their in vitro biologi cal activity. mRNA polyplex properties were analyzed using DLS, zeta potential measurements, and a heparin competitive displacement assay. Polyplex uptake, transfection efficiency, cytotoxicity, and antigen -specific T cell activation were assessed in murine macrophage and dendritic cell lines. mRNA polyplexes formed with polymers that placed the PEGMA block in the center of the polymer chain displayed the greatest stability to heparin displacement, which correl ated to high levels of mRNA commercial liposomal reagent . Polyplex -transfected dendritic cells were shown to be capable of subsequently activating antigen -specific T cells. 1. Introduction Currently, the most significant barrier to widespread use of nucleic acid -based vaccination is achieving efficient gene delivery to DCs. Reported pDNA transfection levels in DCs using nonviral delivery techniques such as lipofection and electroporation ar e typically extremely low, with most groups reporting in vitro efficiencies ranging from 1 -20% [120-123]. In contrast, markedly higher in vitro transfection efficiencies in DCs and other APCs have been obtained using mRNA (up to 90%) [28,122 -124]. This may be due in part to the nuclear entry barrier for pDNA transfection, which is a non -issue for mRNA -based gene therapies. 32 Despite the enormous potential of mRNA as an immunotherapeutic agent , research efforts concerning mRNA delivery vehicles have lagged in comparison to pDNA and siRNA, particularly with respect to synthetic polymer carrier development [22,23] . This issue is further complicated by the distinct physiochemical properties of mRNA compared to other nucleic acids. Many groups have observed that mRNA appears to bind more tightly to polycations relative to pDNA and siRNA [88,91,92,94] . This may be a contributing factor to the results obtained in several studies indicating that commonly used cationic gene carriers such as PEI, PLL, and pDMAEMA are unable to mediate high levels of mRNA transfection in vitro [87-91]. Preliminary experiments utilizing a diblock copolymer system designed for pDNA delivery [72] also produced disappointingly low mRNA transfection efficiencies (unpublished data). Taken together, these findings indicate that the polymer design requirements associated with efficient mRNA delivery may differ significantly from the requirements for other nucleic acids. Elucidating the nature of these requirements would facilitate the successful development of mRNA delivery vectors. Here, a series of multifunctional block copolymers with systematic iterations in polymer block order and PEGMA size (previou sly described in Chapter 2) is used to evaluate the effect of different polymer architectures on in vitro mRNA transfectio n performance . The potential of this system as a platform for mRNA vaccination strategies was evaluated by determining whether polymer -mediated mRNA transfection of DCs can result in the successful present ation the expressed antigen to elicit a T cell response . 33 2. Experimental methods 2.1. Plasmids and in vitro transcription of mRNA Plasmid DNA was prepared using the EndoFree Plasmid Mega Kit (Qiagen). Plasmid pGEM4Z - GFP-A64 (a gift from E. Gilboa, University of Miami) encoding eGFP with a synthetic poly-A tail has been previously described [125] . The GFP coding fragment was excised OVA [126] (a gift from M.J. Bevan, University of Washington) was subcloned into the pVAX1 vector (Invitrogen) and amplified by PCR. The PCR primers used added XbaI and Not I sites to the 5' and 3' ends of zed by SpeI and used as templates for in vitro transcription using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Kit (Ambion). The resultant Formulation of mRNA -polymer polyplexes and lipoplexes Polymers were prepared following previously described procedures (Chapter 2). Polyplexes were formed by combining equal volumes of mRNA (0.1 g/ L in nuclease -free water) and polymer stock solutions for 30 min at room temperature. The theoretical charge ratios (+/ -) of the polyplexes were calculated using the mass concentration of the cationic DMAEMA block, assumed to be 50% protonated at pH 7.4. All polyplexes in this study were formed at a theoretical charge ratio of 4:1 unless otherwise specified. Lipoplexes were formed by comb ining 34 mRNA and Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) at Lipofectamine:mRNA ratio in serum and antibiotic -free media in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. 2.3. Agarose gel electrophoresis For gel retardation assays, p olyplexes were formulated with 0.5 g mRNA at theoretical charge ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1 for 30 min at room temperature as described above. Samples were then loaded into a 1.2% w/v agarose gel stained with 1X SYBR Safe (Invitrogen) and run at 100 V for 30 min . For heparin competitive displacement assays, solutions of heparin sodium salt (Sigma) in water were combined with equal volumes of polyplexes formulated at charge ratio 4:1 containing 0.5 g mRNA and incubated at room temperature for 15 min, followed by gel electrophoresis. For serum protection assays, fetal bovine serum ( FBS) was added to polyplexes at a final FBS concentration of 10% and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by gel electrophoresis. 2.4. Characterization of polyplex size a nd zeta potential DLS and zeta potential measurements were conducted on a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Malvern) at a constant scattering angle of 173\u00b0 at 25 \u00b0C. Polyplexes were diluted to 5 g/mL mRNA in DPBS or water for size and zeta potential measurements, respe ctively. 2.5. Cell culture All cell culture media and reagents were obtained from Gibco unless otherwise specified. The RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line (ATCC) was maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle 35 Medium High Glucose containing L -glutamine supplemented with 10% murine dendritic cell line (a gift from K.L. Rock, University of Massachusetts Medical School) was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing L -glutamine supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM non -essential amino acids, 55 M 2 - mercaptoethanol, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin -streptomycin. The B3Z T cell hybridoma (a gift from N. Shastri, University of California, Berkeley) was maintained in RPMI 1640 containin g L- glutamine supplemented with M 2 -mercaptoethanol, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin -streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2. 2.6. Polyplex internalization studies mRNA was labeled with Cy3 using a Label IT Tracker I ntracellular Nucleic Acid Localization Kit (MirusBio) at a 0.5:1 v/w ratio of Label IT Tracker Reagent to mRNA in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 24 -well plates at 250,000 cells/well in 1 mL complete media and al lowed to adhere overnight. Cells were washed with DPBS and the culture medium replaced with polyplexes formulated with Cy3 -mRNA in 200 L serum - and antibiotic -free media. After 2 h, cells were washed and collected by PBS -based cell dissociation buffer ( Invitrogen), blue to quench extracellular fluorescence. 10,000 events, gated by forward and side scatter to exclude cellular debris, were collected per sample and analyzed using FlowJo software (T reeStar) for Cy3 fluorescence. 36 2.7. In vitro transfection studies RAW 264.7 or DC2.4 cells were seeded in 24 -well plates at 250,000 or 200,000 cells/well , respectively, in 1 mL complete media and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were washed with DPBS and the culture medium replaced with polyplexes or lipoplexe s at 0.25 g mRNA/well in 200 L serum - and antibiotic -free media. After 4 h, cells were washed and collected by PBS - based cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) or 0.25% (Invitrogen). To determine GFP expression levels, 10,000 events per sample gated on viable pr opidium iodide negative cells were acquired on a BD FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). 2.8. Transfection studies in the presence of serum mRNA transfections in RAW 264.7 cells in the presence of serum were carried out as described above, except with the addition of 1% FBS in the transfection medium. pDNA polyplexes were formulated same mRNA polyplexes using gW iz-GFP (Aldevron). Cell seeding protocols were the same as for mR NA transfection. Cells were then washed with DPBS and the culture medium replaced with polyplexes at 0.25 g mRNA/well in 200 L antibiotic -free media containing 10% FBS. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with 500 L complete medium. After an additiona l 20 h, cells were collected and analyzed for flow cytometry as described above. 37 2.9. Fluorescence microscopy RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at 150,000 cells/well in 400 L complete media in a Lab -Tek 8 - well chambered coverglass (Nunc) and allowed to adhere overnight. The cultu re medium was replaced with pol yplexes or lipoplexes at 150 ng mRNA/well in 150 L serum - and antibiotic - free media. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with phenol red -free media containing 5 g/mL Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). imaged on a Axio Z1 fluoresce nce microscope with an a 40x objective. 2.10. Cytotoxicity assay RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in black 96 -well plates at 50,000 cells/well in 200 L complete media and allowed to adhere overnight. The culture medium was replaced with polyplexes at 50 ng mRNA/well in 40 L serum - and antibiotic -free media. After 4 h, 60 L complete media was added to each plate and the cells incubated for an additional 20 h. To de termine cell viability based on metabolic activity, alamarBlue reagent (Invitrogen) was added directly to the culture medium at a 1:10 dilution, incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C, and fluorescence measurements recorded at 585 nm. 2.11. B3Z T cell activation ass ay DC2.4 cells were seeded in U -bottomed 96 -well plates at 50,000 cells/well in 100 L complete media and allowed to adhere overnight. Polyplexes or lipoplexes were added at 50 ng mRNA/well in 100 L serum - and antibiotic -free media. Control cells were t peptide (ovalbumin a.a. 257 -264, After 4 h, washed and co -38 cultured with 100,000 B3Z cells/well in 200 L complete media for 24 h. The media was replaced with 150 L/well lysis buffer containing 0.1 mM 2 -mercaptoethanol, 9 mM MgCl 2, 0.1% Triton X -100, and 0.15 mM chlorophenol red -D-galactyopyranoside in DPBS. After 2 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, absorbance measurements were recorded at 570 nm. 2.12. Statistical methods ANOVA was used to test for treatment ef fects and Tukey's test was used for post hoc pairwise comparisons between individual treatment groups. 3. Results 3.1. mRNA polyplex size and zeta potential All polymers completely condensed mRNA at theoretical charge ratios of 1:1 and higher, as confirmed by an agarose gel retardation assay ( Figure 3.1 ). Polyplexes formulated with mRNA were characterized by DLS and zeta potential measurements ( Table 3.1). When combined with mRNA at a theoretical +/ - charge ratio of 4:1, the resultant polyplexes were 86- 216 nm in diameter. DPE1 and PDE polyplexes were comparably sized, while PED polyplexes were significantly smaller, suggesting that the P -E-D block architecture is more favorable for compact particle formation. However, comparing mR NA polyplexes formulated from DE, DPE1, DPE2, and DPE3, increasing PEGMA block size was observed to correlate with decreasing particle size, demonstrating that improved mRNA condensation can also be achieved by lengthening the hydrophilic segment in the D -P-E configuration. 39 Figure 3.1. Agarose gel retardation assay with mRNA polyplexes. Polyplexes were formulated with mRNA at the indicated theoretical charge ratios (+/ -) of 1 :1, 2:1, or 4 :1 for 30 min prior to agarose gel electrophoresis. R indicates uncomplexed mRNA. Table 3.1.

Zeta potential values are from three experimental runs \u00b1 standard deviation. 40 Comparing PDE, PED and DPE1 to determine the effect of block arrangement on polyplex zeta potential, polyplexes formed with PDE and PED were effectively neutral while DPE1 was still slightly cationic, suggesting that having PEGMA as the middle block of the polymer chain reduces its charge -shielding capability. Comparing DE, DPE1, DPE2, and DPE3 polyplexes, increasing PEGMA size correlated with decreasing zeta potential, demonstrating that improved hydrophilic shielding is achieved with longer PEGMA chains, although complete charge neutralization was not achieved even with the largest PEGMA block (DPE3). 3.2. Polyplex stability To assess the stability of the mRNA -polymer interaction, a competitive displacement assay was performed in which polyplexes were incubated with increasing concentrations of the polyanion heparin ( Figure 3.2). Since mRNA in a polyplex does not migrate in an agarose gel, the reappearance of a free mRNA band indicates that the mRNA is no longer complexed. Polyplexes formed with PDE a nd PED were the least stable, with mRNA displacement beginning to be evident at heparin concentrations of 100 and 150 g/mL, respectively. In comparison, 250 g/mL heparin was required to release mRNA from DPE1 polyplexes. polymer series DE, D PE1, DPE2, and DPE3, polyplexes with longer PEGMA blocks were increasingly resistant to destabilization. Polyplexes formed with DPE3, which had the largest PEGMA block, still retained some mRNA at the highest heparin concentration tested. In summary, the data indicate that the D -P-E configuration provides the greatest polyplex stability, and that this stability is enhanced by increasing the length of the central PEGMA chain. 41 Figure 3.2. mRNA polyplex stability against heparin displacement. Polyplex es were incubated with equal volumes of heparin solutions at the indicated concentrations prior to agarose gel electrophoresis. 3.3. Internalization of Cy3 -labeled polyplexes The in vitro was using the RAW 264.7 Polyplexes formulated with Cy3 -labeled mRNA were incubated with cells for 2 h prior to flow cytometric analysis for Cy3 fluorescence indicating polyplex using blue. All mRNA polyplexes exhibited significant uptake by macrophages (Figure 3.3 ). Although the mean cell -associated fluorescence values differed slightly b etween certain polymer carriers, the overall uptake profiles were very similar, suggesting that polymer architecture did not play a major role in influencing the extent of polyplex internalization. Uptake of naked mRNA was also observed (data not shown), which is consistent with previous reports [127] . 42 Figure 3. 3. mRNA polyplex uptake by RAW 264.7 macrophages. NT indicates untreated cells. Data are from a single experiment conducted in triplicate \u00b1 standard deviation. All treatments are significantly different from NT, and PDE and PED are significantly differe nt from DPE1 and DPE3 (p < 0.05). 3.4. Evaluation of in vitro mRNA transfection activity The ability of the polymers to mediate mRNA transfection in vitro was evaluated in two murine immune cell lines, RAW 264.7 macrophages ( Figure 3 C ) 3 .4.B). Cells were incubated with mRNA polyplexes for 4 h prior to analysis for GFP expression by flow cytometry. Lipofectamine 2000 (LF), a commercially available liposomal reagent, was used as a positive control. In both cell lines, PDE and PED polyplexes failed to produce significant mRNA transfection (< 2% cking a PEGMA block, generated 8% GFP+ cells, much lower than th e efficiency obtained with LF ( 30%). In co ntrast, efficient at mRNA, with GFP expression levels much higher than LF. In RAW 264.7 cells, the transfection efficiency increased dra matically with increasing PEGMA 43 Figure 3.4.

Data are from a single representative experiment conducted in triplicate \u00b1 standard deviation. In (A), DPE2 and DPE3 are significantly different than all other treatments and each other (p < 0.05) . In (B), DPE1, DPE2, and DPE3 are significantly different than all other treatments, and DPE3 is significantly different than DPE1 (p < 0.05). ( C) Apotome 264.7 macrophages (blue, Hoechst nucl ear stain). Scale bar is 50 m. block size: 38% (DPE1) vs. 68% (DPE2) vs. 77% (DPE3). This trend was also observed in DC2.4 cells, but was less pronounced: 43% (DPE1) vs. 45% (DPE2) vs. 50% (DPE3). Overall, these findings demonstrate the importance of polymer architecture in successful mRNA transfection: polymers with the D -P-E arrangement were the most effective for intracellular 44 mRNA delivery and were capable of mediating transfection levels superior even to LF, while polymers with alternative block a rrangements produced very low gene expression. 3.5. Effect of serum on transfection activity To determine whether mRNA polyplexes were capable of mediating transfection in the presence of serum, a serum protection assay was performed in which 10% FBS ( Figure 3.5) . Unprotected mRNA was rapidly degraded, as indicated by the disappearance of the free mRNA band, while no evidence of mRNA decomplexation was observed with any of the polymers. Figure protection assay gel electrophoresis. R indicates naked mRNA. The faint high molecular weight band observed in all lanes containing serum is due to non -specific staining of serum components. Subsequently, an in vitro mRNA transfection assay was performed using RAW 264.7 macrophages in the presence or absence of FBS. Surprisingly, as little as 1% FBS in the transfection medium was sufficient to almost completely abolish polyplex transfection activity (2-, 5-, 16-, and 38 -fold decreases DPE1, DPE2, transfection with D -P-E series polyplexes elicited high levels of gene expression even in the presence of 10% FBS (33%, 39% suggest that mRNA transfection is uniquely inhibited by serum, and that this inhibition does not appear to be caused by the serum protein -mediated unpackaging of polyple xes.

Data are from a single experiment conducted in triplicate \u00b1 standard deviation 46 3.6. Polyplex cytotoxicity The the mRNA polyplexes RAW ( Figure 3.7 ). Cells were incubated with polyplexes for 24 h, after which cell viability was quantified based on total metabolic activity resulting in reduction of the alamarBlue reagent. All polyplexes exhibited low cytotoxicity cytotoxicity generally correlating with increasing transfection activity. Figure 3.7. In vitro cytotoxicity of polyplexes in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Viabilities are normalized relative to untreated cells. Data are from a single representative experiment conducted in triplicate \u00b1 standard deviation. 3.7. Antigen presentation assay To determine whether dendritic cells transfected with mRNA polyplexes could successfully process and present the encoded antigen on MHC molecules, an in vitro MHC I antigen presentation assay was performed using the B3Z CD8+ T cell hybridoma ( Figure 3.8). The B3Z cell line produces -galactosidase upon recognition of the ovalbumin CD8 epitope (SIINFEKL) presented the context of MHC H -2Kb [128] . DC 2.4 cells were transfected with polyplexes containing ovalbumin mRNA for 4 h, cocultured with B3Z cells for 24 h, and evaluated for antigen presentation by quantifying the overall T cell response via -galactosidase activity. All polymers except for PDE and PED generated high levels of T cell activity, outperforming LF. DPE1 in particular produced the highest T cell response, despite having a slightly lower mRNA transfection efficiency than DPE2 and DPE3. Similarly, DE produced less gene expression than LF in the transfection assay, but mediated higher levels of T cell activity. In summary, these findings demonstrate that mRNA transfection mediated by these polymer systems can lead to antigen presentation and subsequent T cell a ctivation, although the level of activation does not necessarily correlate precisely to the efficiency of transfection.

Discussion Typically, triblock copolymer architectures incorporating a hydrophilic segment place this block at the chain end. Accordingly, two of the polymers in this study, PDE and PED, were synthesized with PEGMA segments at one end and either DMAEMA or DEAEMA -co-BMA segments at the other. A third polymer, DPE1, was synthesized with the same block lengths as PDE and PED, but placed the PEGMA segment in the middle of the polymer chain instead. Intriguingly, of these three polymers, only DPE1 was capable of mediating mRNA transfection and antigen presentation in vitro . To further explore this phenomenon, the effect of PEGMA block size was investigated by synthesizing a series of triblock copolymers in the copolymer lacking PEGMA (DE). Transfection studies demonstrated that delivery efficacy improved significantly with increasing PEGMA block size, though the magnitude of the difference was dependent o n cell type. The most efficient polymers were able to surpass a commercial liposomal 2000 , in mRNA transfection studies suggested that the differences in mRNA transfection were potentially linked to polyplex stability: the most stable polyplexes were also those that exhibited the highest transfection efficiencies. Destabilization of polyplexes by anionic compounds such as serum proteins, extracellular matrix components, and cell surface glycosaminog lycans constitutes a significant barrier to intracellular gene delivery [64,77,129,130] . While PEGylation improves polyplex stability by creating a hydration shell that masks excess cationic charges [26,64,77] , hydrophilic polymers may also interfere with nucleic acid condensation [131,132] . Of the six pol ymer systems investigated in this report, polyplexes formulated with PDE and PED 49 were also the least stable to heparin displacement, despite having near -neutral zeta potentials indicative of complete hydrophilic shielding. In contrast, polymers in the D -E and D -P-E arrangements exhibited improved stability, with longer PEGMA block lengths conferring stronger mRNA binding and reduced cationic surface charge. The D -P-E polymer architecture in particular appeared to achieve an optimal balance between charge shielding and polyplex stability that translated into highly efficient mRNA transfection. While \u00dczg\u00fcn et al. also concluded that improved mRNA binding led to improved transfection [91], other groups have demonstrated that highly stable mRNA -polymer interactions can be detrimental to transfection, presumably due to the inability of these vehicles to release mRNA in the cytosol [87,88,94] . These findings are not necessarily inconsistent, given the structural and compositional differences between the polymer systems used in these various studies. Taken together, it is clear that polyplex stability is an important factor that needs to be carefully modulated in order to achieve optimal mRNA delivery. To determine whether efficient mRNA transfection translated to successful antigen presentation and subsequent T cell activation, DC2.4 cells transfected w ith mRNA polyplexes T cells. All polymers except for PDE and PED generated T cell responses that surpassed those attained by Lipofectamine 2000. Surprisingly, polymers DE and DPE1 produced greater T cell activ ation than might be expected from their relative transfection efficiencies. Although the underlying reason for these discrepancies remains to be elucidated, potential explanations include differences in transfection activity when 50 using ovalbumin mRNA vers us GFP mRNA, or changes in antigen processing pathways triggered by cell -polymer interactions. 5. Conclusions A series of multifunctional block copolymers composed of DMAEMA, PEGMA, and DEAEMA -co-BMA were evaluated their ability to facilitate intr acellular mRNA delivery. Polymers exhibited favorable size, charge, internalization and biocompatibility when complexed with mRNA. The D -P-E architecture with the PEGMA block in the center of the polymer chain demonstrated enhanced polyplex sta bility against heparin displacement relative to other configurations, with longer PEGMA block lengths enhancing mRNA binding. This system achieved superior mRNA transfection efficiencies in two immune cell lines compared to a commercial liposomal reagent, Lipofectamine 2000. Transfected dendritic cells were shown to be capable of subsequently activating antigen -specific T cells, demonstrating the potential of these multifunctional block copolymers for mRNA -based vaccination strategies. 51 Chapter 4 Evaluation of mRNA polyplexes for in vivo gene delivery Abstract This chapter describes studies performed in mouse models to evaluate the efficacy of mRNA polyplexes for in vivo delivery . A luciferase mRNA reporter vector was constructed and used in conju nction with live animal imaging to determine the extent of polyplex -mediated gene expression following subcutaneous administration . In vivo polyplex tissue distribution and trafficking to draining lymph node DCs were characterized using fluorescently -labeled mRN A. Contrary to in vitro observations, naked mRNA produced superior in vivo transfectio n compared to mRNA polyplexes. While l ocal tissue distribution studies suggested that delivery mode and vehicle characteristics affected mRNA trafficking in vivo , neither naked mRNA nor mRNA polyplexes were observed in DCs in the draining lymph nodes. 1. Introduction One of the primary issues confounding the development of synthetic gene delivery vehicles is the poor correlation of in vitro transfection results w ith in vivo efficacy. This discrepancy may be related to t he cationic nature of many lipids and polymers used in in vitro gene delivery. A recent study by van den Berg et al. compared the expression of naked pDNA, pDNA lipoplexes, and pDNA polyplexes charges . In an in vitro assay, polyplexes and lipoplexes exhibited 26-fold and 900 -fold increases in gene expression compared to naked pDNA, respectively. However, whe n administered by intradermal tattooing to ex vivo 52 human skin and in vivo murine skin, lipoplexes and p olyplexes yielded extremely low levels of gene expression, in contrast to the robust expression obtained with naked pDNA. In accordance with these results, intradermal vaccination with lipoplexes and polyplexes also failed to elicit detectable levels of a ntigen -specific immune response s. PEGylation of lipoplexes and polyplexes restored in vivo transfection activity and enabled the induction of an tigen -specific T cell responses, despite lower transfection efficiencies in vitro compared to unPEGylated carriers . Similar results were obtained by \u00dczg\u00fcn et al. using pDNA polyplexes formulated with PEI or -fold in vitro , intratracheal administration of p(DMAEMA -co-OEGMA) p olyplexes resulted in a 7-fold increase in gene expression compared to PEI polyplexes. Taken together, these findings suggest that shielding of cationic surface charges is crucial for efficient in vivo gene delivery. The cationic nature of many synthetic delivery vehicles has been associated with toxicity, aggregation, and polyplex instability in vivo [63], and may contribute to poor in vivo transfection performance. Previous studies have demonstrated that negatively charged biomacromolecules such as serum proteins, extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and cell -surface glycosaminoglycans can interact with an d destabilize polyplexes, leading to premature extracellular unpackaging [64,77,129,130] . Shielding excessive cationic charge through the use of PEG and other hydrophilic steric stabilizers may mitigate the se adverse effects . 53 Additionally, the diffusivity of cationic vehicle s in vivo may be limited due to electrostatic interactions with the ECM , or also by the formation of large aggregates caused by polyplex instability . This has implications for the accessibilit y of polyplexes to resident DCs and Palumbo et . PAEM polyplexes rapidly formed large aggregates in media formulated to mimic the in vivo environment, while PEG -PAEM polyp lexes remained stable. Upon intradermal administration , PEG -PAEM polyplexes were observed to be more widely distributed from the injection site than PEI and PAEM polyplexes. Furthermore, DC colocalization was significantly higher with PEG - PAEM compared to PEI and PAEM polyplexes. In the latter case, DC colocalization was limited to the edge of the aggregates, suggesting that DCs were unable to infiltrate into the dense polyplex clumps. While these studies begin to elucidate critical design parameters for successful in vivo gene transfection, s ystematic studies of the effect of vehicle characteristics on in vivo delivery efficacy are still needed, particularly with respect to mRNA. Here, studies assessing a series of block copolymer architectures (Chapters 2 and 3) for in vivo mRNA delivery are described . Polyplexes were formulated using polymer micelles with varying PEGMA content and cationic surface charge, then evaluated in mouse models for transfection efficacy , local tissue distribution, and trafficking to lymph node DCs. 54 2. Experimental methods 2.1. Plasmids and in vitro transcription of mRNA The construction of pGEM4Z -A64 has been previously described (Chapter 3). Plasmid DNA was purified using the EndoFree Plasmid Mega using primers that add ed flanking PstI and NotI restriction sites to the 5' and 3' ends of the cDNA, by SpeI and used as a template for in vitro transcription using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Kit (Ambion). 2.2. Formulation of mRNA -polymer polyplexes Polymers were prepared following previously described procedures (Chapter 2) in DPBS, for in vitro studies, or in HEPES -buffered glucose (HBG, 20 mM HEPE, 5% 7.4), for in vivo studies . Polyplexes were formed by combining equal volumes of mRNA (0.1 g/L in nuclease -free water) and polymer stock solutions for 30 min at room temperature. The theoretical charge ratios (+/ -) of the polyplexes were calculated using the mass concen tration of the cationic DMAEMA block, assumed to be 50% protonated at pH 7.4. All polyplexes in this study were formed at a theoretical charge ratio of 4 :1 unless otherwise specified. As controls, some mRNA polyplexes were formulated with in vivo -jetPEI (Polyplus) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols at a n N/P ratio of 8. 55 2.3. Cell culture All cell culture media and reagents were obtained from Gibco unless otherwise specified. The RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium High Glucose containing L -glutamine supplemented with 10% FBS luciferase assay RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 24 -well plates at 250,000 cells/well i n 1 mL complete medi a and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were washed with DPBS and the culture medium replaced with polyplexes at 0.25 g mRNA/well in 200 L serum - and antibiotic -free medi a. After 4 h, cells were washed and lysed with 150 L Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega) for 5 min. 100 L of lysate were assayed for bioluminescence signal using a Bright -Glo Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Luminescence values were normalized to the total cellular pro tein per well as determined by a BCA assay kit (Pierce). 2.5. In vivo luciferase transfection and bioluminescence imaging Female BALB/c mice 6 to 8 weeks old (Jackson Laboratories) were maintained under specific pathogen -free conditions and in accordance with University of Washington IACUC protocols . Uncomplexed mRNA or p olyplexes containing 10 g mRNA were administered via a single subcutaneous injection of 200 L volume in the lower right abdominal quadrant. To assess in vivo luciferase gene expression , mice were injected intraperit oneally 150 mg/kg Xenogen IVIS 200 Spectrum Imager. Luciferase expression was quantified based on total luminesc ence signal normalized per area using Living Image software (Caliper). 2.6. In vivo trafficking of fluorescent polyplexes mRNA was labeled with Cy5 using a Label IT Tracker Intracellular Nucleic Acid Localization Kit (Mi rusBio) at a 0.5:1 v/w ratio of Label IT Tracker Reagent to mRNA in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Uncomplexed mRNA or polyplexes containing 10 g Cy5 -mRNA were administered via a single subcutaneous injection of 200 L volume in the lower ri ght abdominal quadrant of 6 - to 8-week -old female BALB/c mice . For fluorescence imaging, mice anesthesized with isoflurane and imaged using a Xenogen IVIS200. Image analysis was performed using Living Image software. 2.7. Polyplex trafficking to draining lymph nodes Cy5-labeled polyplexes or mRNA were prepared and administered via subcutaneous injection as described above to 6 - to 8-week -old female C57BL/6 mice. Animals were euthanized by CO 2 at specified time points and the inguinal lymph nodes were isolated. Lymph nodes were digested with 0.34 mg/mL Libera se TL and 2 mg/mL through a 40 \u00b5m cell strainer, and incubated for 5 min in ACK buffer to lyse erythrocytes. Cell suspensions were incubated with r at anti -mouse CD16/32 antibody (BD Biosciences ) to block Fc -anti-CD11c (BioLegend ) and PE -anti-I-Ab (BD Biosciences). Approximately 1 million single cell events per sample were collect ed using a BD FACSCanto II and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar) . 57 2.8. Statistical methods ANOVA was used to test for treatment effects and Tukey's test was used for post hoc pairwise comparisons between individual treatment groups. 3. Results 3.1. Evaluation of i n vitro luciferase transfection An in vitro transfection assay in RAW 264.7 macrophages was used to confirm the functionality of the lu ciferase mRNA reporter construct . Cells were incubated with mRNA polyplexes for 4 h prior to the analysis of gene expression by bioluminescence signal . The relative expression levels followed trends similar to those observed in the GFP transfection assays described in Chapter 3, with t he DPE1, DPE2, and DPE3 polyplexes generating the highest amounts of luciferase expression (Figure 4.1 ). Uncomplexed mRNA performed poorly in the in vitro transfection assay, with expression levels four orders of magnitude lower than the DPE series polyme rs and roughly comparable to untreated negative controls (data not shown). 3.2. In vivo gene expression The ability of mRNA polyplexes to mediate transfection in vivo was evaluated using a mouse model. Polyplexes formulated with the luciferase mRNA reporter construct were administered via subcutaneous injection, and bioluminescence imaging was used to determine the extent of local gene expres sion at specified time poi nts. 58 Figure 4 .1. In vitro transfection of RAW 264.7 macrophages. Data are presented as relative luminescence units (RLU) normalized to total cellular protein and are from a single representative experiment conducted in triplicate \u00b1 standard deviation. Uncomplexed mRNA produced the highest levels of luciferase expression, while the PDE, PED, and DPE3 polyplexes generated low to undetectable bioluminescence signals (Figure 4.2 ). Transfection mediated by naked mRNA was transient, with luciferase expression peaking at approximately 8 h post -injection and undetectable by 96 h. Control polyplexes formulated with jetPEI, a polymer -based reagent, also failed to mediate transfection in vivo . Similar negative results were observed for DE, DPE1, and DPE 2 polyplexes (data not shown). Overall, these results demonstrate that naked mRNA is superior to mRNA polyplexes for in vivo transfection of local tissue following subcutaneous injection. Intriguingly, this finding contradicts observations from in vitro transfection studies, in which naked mRNA consistently performed p oorly compared to mRNA polyplexes. 59 Figure 4.2. were administered via subcutaneous injection at t = 0 h. Mice were imaged for biolum inescence indicative of luciferase gene expression at the indicated time points. 3.3. In vivo polyplex trafficking To assess the fate of polyplexes in vivo , mice were given subcutaneous injections of Cy5-labeled mRNA and l ive animal imaging was used to track the distribution of fluorescence over time. A preliminary study screening the entire block copolymer series indicated that naked mRNA was cleared from the injection site more rapidly than mRNA in polyplexes and that neutral polyplexes (PDE, PED) appeared to dissipate rapidly than (DE, DPE1, DPE2, DPE3 ) (Figure 4.3 ). In order to further investigate this phenomenon, a second study with higher animal numbers was performed to compare the traffick ing of naked mRNA, highly cationic DE polyplexes (zeta 60 potential 21.0 mV), and slightly cationic DPE3 polyplexes (zeta potential 12.4 mV) ( Figure 4.4 ). The results were consistent with the preliminary data: naked mRNA was eliminated more quickly from the injection site than mRNA in polyplexes and was not longer observable at 4 h post-injection. Comparing the two polyplexes, the less cationic DPE3 polyplexes took 24 h to be cleared, while the fluorescence signals from the highly cationic DE polyplexes were still detectable at 48 h. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the trafficking profile of mRNA following subcutaneous injection is contingent upon the mode of delivery (naked versus complexed), as well as the physiochemical characteristics o f the delivery vehicle. Figure 4.3. Preliminary screen of in vivo trafficking of mRNA polyplexes. Polyplexes were formulated with Cy5 -labeled mRNA and administered via subcutaneous injection at t = 0 h. Control animals received no treatment (NT) or naked mRNA. Mice were imaged at the specified time points for Cy5 fluorescence. 61 Figure 4.4. In vivo trafficking of mRNA .

(A) Distributions of fluorescent mRNA at the specified time points post -injection. ( B) Tempo ral evolution of average Cy5 fluorescence intensities at the local injection site. DE varies significantly from RNA at t = 4 h, and from both RNA and DPE3 at t = 24 h (p < 0.05). Data are from a single experiment \u00b1 standard deviation. 3.4. Polyplex traf ficking to DCs in draining lymph nodes To determine whether mRNA polyplexes were being trafficked to the draining lymph nodes, polyplexes were formulated with Cy5 -labeled mRNA, administered via subcutaneous injection , 62 and the inguinal lymph nodes isolated at subsequent time points. The CD11c+ MHCII+ DC population, representing roughly 1 -2% of the total lymph node cell population (data not shown), was analyzed for Cy5 fluoresc ence indicative of mRNA uptake. At 48 h post -injection, uptake frequencies for na ked mRNA, DE polyplexes, and DPE3 polyplexes were all extremely low ( 2% Cy5+ cells ) and were comparable to background fluorescence levels observed in animals treated with HBG only as negative control s (Figure 4.5 ). Figure 4.5. In vivo uptake of mRNA polyplexes by node DCs. Polyplexes formulated with Cy5 -labeled mRNA and administered via subcutaneous injection (n = 1 -3 mice per group) . Control animals received injections of HBG only (Buffer). Inguinal lymph nodes were isol ated after 48 h and the percentage of CD11c+ MHCII+ DCs demonstrating Cy5 -mRNA uptake determined by flow cytometric analysis. Similar results were obtained with other polyplexes, and at 12 h and 24 h post -injection (data not shown). Overall, the eviden ce indicates that neither naked mRNA nor mRNA polyplexes appear to be trafficked to the DC population in draining lymph nodes following subcutaneous injection. 63 4. Discussion Disappointingly, despite previous findings demonstrating successful in vitro mRNA transfection using the polymer series described in this work , none of these polymers achieved satisfactory mRNA delivery in vivo . mRNA polyplexes failed to mediate any observable in vivo transfection, while delivery of naked mRNA was able to generate transient expression at the injection site. These results stand in contradiction to the in vitro data, which consistently demonstrated that polyplexes were superior to naked mRNA for transfection. As discussed in the Chapter I ntroduction, these findings are not necessarily unusual, given previous reports of such discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo delivery efficacies for naked and complexed pDNA. However, while van de n Berg et al. were able to restore in vivo pDNA activity by PEGylation of the ir cationic delivery vehicles [133] , no gene expression was observed in this study even with polymers incorporating PEGMA segments and exhibiting reduced cationic surface charges. Polymer vehicle characteristics did appear to influence polyplex trafficking: shielded polyplexes were cleared more rapidly than cationic polyplexes following subcutaneous injection. The prolonged retention of cationic polyplexe s at the injection site suggested the formation of polymer \"depots,\" or aggregates that could prevent cells from accessing and taking up mRNA for transfection [135] . However , since the differences in polyplex tissue distrib ution did not translate to detectable changes in gene transfection, the significance of these results for delivery vehicle design remains ambiguous. It appears that the reduction of polyplex charge by incorporation of PEGMA is not sufficient to guarantee successful in vivo mRNA transfection, and that future studies will need to focus on other design parameters . 64 A recent report suggests that delivery route may also be an important factor for successful in vivo mRNA delivery [136] . P hua et al. found that nanoparticulate mRNA formulated from a commercial reagent successfully transfected DCs in vitro , while naked mRNA failed to produce any observable gene expression. The opposite trend was observed f ollowing subcutaneous administration in mice, in which naked mRNA generated higher and more prolonged levels of gene expression compared to mRNA nanoparticles. Intriguingly , this pattern only held true for the subcutaneous route : when mRNA was delivered via intravenous or intranasal administration, mRNA nanoparticles outperformed naked mRNA by a significant margin . These findings are corroborated by Su et al., who also reported the superiority of nanoparticulate mRNA compared to naked nucleic acid for intranasal delivery [95]. Based on these results, it appears that subcutaneous sites may not be optimal for polymer -based mRNA delivery. Cellular uptake of naked mRNA versus mRNA nanoparticles occurs through distinct pathways [137] , and it is possible that the uptake mechanisms for polyplex -based sy stems could be relatively in efficient in subcutaneous tissue . For vaccines, the choice of delivery route must also take into consideration the accessibility of the vaccine particles by DCs. Initiation of an adaptive immune response requires the inter action of antigen -loaded DCs with T cells residing in secondary lymphoid organs such as the lymph nodes [138] . Vaccines c an accomplish this by (1) targeting DCs already resident in the lymph nodes or (2) targeting DCs in peripheral tissues that subsequently migrate to the lymph nodes [21,139,140] . Particle size has been demonstrated to strongly influence the mode of lymph node trafficking , with smaller particles (< 100 nm) capable of passive drainage to lymph nodes, and 65 larger particles relying upon capture by peripheral DCs [141-143]. Based on the size range of the mRNA polyplex es (86-216 nm), trafficking to lymph nodes would be expected to occur primarily via uptake by DCs in the skin . However, no mRNA uptake was observed in lymph node DCs wit h either naked or polyplex mRNA at any of the time points examined in this study. Overall, these findings demonstrate that significant improvements to the block copolymer platform are needed in order to achieve efficacious in vivo delivery of mRNA vaccines . Recommendations for f uture studies are to (1) redesign the current polymer carrier platform to improve transfection efficacy and targeting to lymph node DCs , and (2) investigate alternative delivery routes, such as intranasal administration, which have proven more amenable than subcutaneous injection for nano particle -mediated mRNA delivery . 5. Conclusions A series of multifunctional block copolymers encompassing varying compositions of DMAEMA, PEGMA, and DEAEMA -co-BMA were evaluated for their ability facilitate mRNA delivery in vivo . While mRNA in transfection in vitro , they did not generate satisfactory transfection following subcutaneous administration in mice , with naked mRNA producing superior levels of gene expression . However, n either naked mRNA n or polyplexes were observed in DCs in the draining lymph nodes . These findings suggest that further improvements in polymer design are needed not only to improve the efficiency of polymer -mediated in vivo mRNA transfection, but also to enhance trafficking of mRNA vaccines to DCs. 66 Chapter 5 Evaluation of glycopolymer micelles for in vivo delivery of pDNA vaccines Matthew J. Manganiello contributed equally to this work . Abstract This chapter describes studies performed to evaluate glycopolymer micelles for in vivo pDNA delivery. A micelles containing a pH -responsive DEAEMA -co- BMA core were synthesized via RAFT polymerization. To assess the effectivene ss of glycotargeting for pDNA vaccine delivery, the following micelle corona compositions were investigated: (1) varying molar ratios condensed pDNA into 87-200 nm polyplexes , with zeta potentials of the polyplexes varying based on the corona composition: micelles with high DMAEMA content generated positive zeta potentials, purely glyco sylated micelles were near neutral, and negative. ManEMA, GalEMA, and PEGMA polyplexes produced gene expression following subcutaneous administration in mice , while cationic polyplexes failed to transfection . ManEMA and GalEMA polyplexes DCs (13.7% and 10.2% pDNA+ cells , respectively) compared to other polyplexes and free pDNA, demonstrating the potential of RAFT -based glycopolymer micelles for enhancing in vivo delivery of pDNA vaccines . 67 1. Introduction pDNA vaccination is a promising strategy for combating a wide vari ety of diseases and pathogens, as it is safe, versatile , and capable of eliciting cellular and humoral immunity [3,144] . However, the low immunogenicity of pDNA vaccines in humans remains a major barrier to the clinical utility of this technology [17]. One approach to improving vaccine potency is the usage of synthetic carrier s, most commonly polymers, l iposomes , or micro/nanoparticles [20], to to DCs . As professional APCs, DCs are an ideal target for vaccination applications due to their critical role in the initiation of adaptive immunity . Immature DCs survey peripheral tissues for pathogens and, upon capturing foreign antigens, undergo maturation and migrate to the lymph nodes for antigen presentation to T cells [145] . Vaccine d elivery strategies typically target antigens to peripheral DCs located in tissues such as the skin, but have also directly targeted DCs resident in lymph nodes [139,143] . Mannos e-functionalized carriers have been the subject of much research interest owing to their ability to target DCs via the macrophage mannose . In DCs, the MMR functio ns as an antigen uptake receptor, enhancing the processing and prese ntation of mannosylated antigens [149-151]. For the immunostimulatory potential of mannose glycotargeting has been demonstrated in a variety of carrier systems, includin g 68 While the affinity between a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of a C -type lectin receptor and a simple is rel atively [161] , natural glycan -lectin interactions frequently involve multivalent binding between more complex polysaccharide structures and multiple CRDs thus increasing the overall avidity [162] . monomers incorporating pendent monosaccharides to generate a glycopolymer chain. Controlled free radical polymerization techniques such as RAFT offer precise control of polymer archit ectures and have been widely used for the development of gene delivery vectors [80,85] . Lowe et al. described the first RAFT polymerization of a glycomonom er, 2 -methacryloxyethyl glucoside [163] . A wide variety of RAFT glycopolymer architectures h ave been reported since, including micelles developed copolymers of ManEMA and DMAEMA, and demonstrated that these systems exhibited both carbohydrate -specific lectin binding and pDNA condensing capabilities [169] . However studies assessing the in vivo performance of RAFT glycopolymers for gene delivery applications remain scarce. Here, the development and in vivo evaluation of mannose -functionalized glycopolymer micelles prepared using RAFT synthesis is described . These micelles are based upon a previously reported diblock copolymer pDNA delivery vector utilizing a pH -responsive DEAEMA and BMA (DEAEMA -co-BMA) in core to facilitate escape from endolysosomal entrapment [72]. To assess the effect of mannosylation on pDNA delivery characteristics, the micelle series was designed with va rying ManEMA and DMAEMA content in the micelle corona. Micelles incorporating GalEMA or PEGMA in the corona were also 69 investigated, in order to provide comparisons with untargeted glyco polymer micelles and untargeted hydrophilic micelles, respectively . 2. Experimental methods 2.1. Materials Chemicals were supplied by Sigma -Aldrich unless otherwise specified. 2,2-azobis(4 obtained from Wako Chemicals. Spectra/Por 7 standard regenerated cellulose dialysis tubing was obtained from Spectrum Labs and Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters were ob tained from EMD 4,4 glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA, average 300 g/mol) was passed through a basi c alumina column prior to use. 2.2. Synthesis of poly(DEAEMA -co-BMA) macro chain transfer agent The RAFT copolymerization of DEAEMA and BMA was conducted in dioxane (50 wt% monomer) at 90 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 6 h using ECT and V40 as the chain transfer 70 agent (CTA) and radical initiator, respectively. The ini tial monomer to CTA molar ratio ([M] 0/[CTA] 0) was CTA to initiator molar ratio ([CTA] 0/[I]0) was 20:1, and molar feed ratio of DEAEMA:BMA was 3:2 (40 mol% BMA). The resultant polymer, termed EB40 macroCTA , was isolated by dialysis against methanol with 1000 MWCO tubing followed by rotary evaporation and drying overnight in vacuo to remove residual solvent. 2.3. Diblock an EB40 macroCTA in which the initial molar feed of AcManEMA was 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100% , to generate polymers 0% Man, 25% Man, Man, and respectively . AcGalEMA was polymerized from an EB40 macroCTA to generate Gal . Each polymerization was con ducted in dioxane at 40 wt% monomer for 18 h at 30 \u00b0C using V70 as the primary radical source. The [M] 0/[CTA] 0 and [CTA] 0/[I]0 respectively. The resultant diblock copolymers were isolated by precipitation into cold hexanes and dried overnight in vacuo. 2.4. Saponification of glycopolymers To display native pendent glycomoieties on the glycopolymers, protective acetyl groups were removed via base -catalyzed hydrolysis. The glycopolymers (0 -100% Man, Gal) were separately added to a solution of 1 wt% sodium methoxide in anhydrous methanol at a copolymer concentration of 50 mg/mL. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature, the solutions were neutralized with acetic acid to a pH of ~7 and dialyzed against deionized water using 1000 MWCO tubing. The solutions were then lyophilized to obtain th e final diblock copolymers. Aqueous stocks of the deprotected diblock copolymers were formulated from the lyophilized 71 material at 2 mg/mL in 1X pH 7.4 phosphate -buffered copolymers were pre -dissolved at 40 mg/mL in methanol prior to addition into buffer to promote micelle formation. For in vivo studies, copolymer stocks were buffer exchanged into HEPES buffered glucose (HBG; 20 mM HEPES, 5% (w/v) glucose, pH 7.4) via centrifugal filtration with a 3000 MWCO. 2.5. Synthesis o f poly(PEGMA) macro chain transfer agent The synthesis of PEGMA -containing block copolymers was conducted as previously described (Chapter 2) [171] . The RAFT polymerization of PEGMA was conducted in dioxane (10 wt % monomer) at 60 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 18 h using CTP and AIBN as the CTA and radical initiator, respectively. The [M] 0/[CTA] 0 and [CTA] 0/[I] 0 ratios were polymer, termed pPEGMA was isolat ed and dried. 2.6. copolymerization of DEAEMA from pPEGMA were in dioxane at 40 wt% monomer for 18 h at 60 \u00b0C using V501 as the radical initia tor. The [M] 0/[CTA] 0 and [CTA] 0/[I] 0 ratios were 100:1 and 4:1, respectively. The resultant polymer, termed PEG, was isolated by precipitation into pentane and dried. Dried polymers were then dissolved into ethanol followed by addition into DPBS (10 vol % ethanol, 8 -12 mg/mL polymer), purified by chromatographic separation via a PD -10 desalting column (GE Healthcare), and lyophilized. Polymer stock solutions were prepared by redissolving lyophilized polymers into ethanol followed by addition into HBG or DPBS (2 vol% ethanol, 2 mg/mL polymer). 72 2.7. Gel permeation chromatography GPC was used to determine molecular weights and (M w/Mn, PDI) were connecte d in s to a 1200 series , refractometer Optilab containing 0.1 wt.% LiBr at 60 \u00b0C was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The molecular weights of each polymer were determined using a multi -detector calibration based on dn/dc values calculated separately for copolymer composition assuming 100% mass recov ery. 2.8. 1H-NMR spectroscopy The 1H-NMR all dried macroCTA intermediates and final lyophilized polymers were acquired using a Bruker AV 500 at 25 \u00b0C with polymer dissolved at 10-20 mg/mL in CDCl 3 (PEG) or CD Man, Gal) . 2.9. Hemol ysis the diblock endosomal membranes was assessed by as . Briefly, polymers (20 \u00b5g/mL) were incubated with erythrocytes in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffers (supplemented with 150 mM NaCl) of varying pH values (7.4, 7.0, 6.6, 6.2, and 5.8) intended to mimic the acidifying pH gradient to which endocytosed material is exposed.

Bloo d samples were collected on day 20 via submandibular bleeding. Mice were sacrificed on day 28 by CO 2 euthanasia and the spleens removed. Splenocytes were isolated by homogenizing the spleen, passing the cell suspension through two 100 m cell strainers, and in cubating with ACK lysis 77 buffer for 5 min to lyse red blood cells. Isolated splenocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 2 mM L supplemented All materials for the ICC staining procedure were obtained from BD Biosciences unless otherwise stated. Isolated splenocytes were seeded in U -bottomed 96 -well plates at 2 x 106 cells/well in 100 L media. Cells were stimulated with 20 g/mL each of ovalbumin CD4 and CD8 peptide epitopes 1 h, then treated with 0.2 L/well GolgiStop for 8 h at 37 \u00b0C to inhibit cytokine secretion.

Statistic al Analysis ANOVA was used to test for treatment effects, and Tukey's test was used for post hoc pairwise comparisons between individual treatment groups. 3. Results 3.1. Polymer synthesis and characterization A series of mannosylated diblock copolymers was synthesized via RAFT using the methodology outlined in Scheme 5.1. These glycopolymers consisted of two discrete functional segments: (1) a DC-targeting block composed of varying monomer feed ratios of DMAEMA and AcManEMA (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%), and an endosomolytic block composed of a copolymer of DEAEMA and BMA (Table 5.1). The monomer feed ratio of the DEAEMA -co-BMA was 40% BMA , in accordance with previous work demonstrating that this composition is optimal for cytosolic delivery and pDNA transfection of , a galactosylated diblock copolymer was also prepared in a similar fashion using AcGalEMA as the first block. A PEGylated diblock copolymer substituting PEGMA as the first block was synthesized as an additional non -targeted control using previously described protocols (Chapter 2). 79 Scheme 5.1. Representative RAFT -mediated synthesis of glycopolymer micelles. Polymers consisted of an endosomolytic block (DEAEMA -co-BMA), acted as a macroCTA for the copolymerization of DMAEMA and AcManEMA at varying molar feed r atios. AcGalEMA glycopolymer synthesis followed the same scheme with the omission of DMAEMA. Table 5.1. Molecular weights, polydispersities, and monomer compositions for diblock copolymer designs.

For the mannosylated glycopolymer series, NMR analysis demonstrated that the final monomer incorporation of AcManEMA and DMAEMA was close to the initial feed ratios (Figure 5.2). The protective acetyl groups were subsequently removed via b ase-catalyzed hydrolysis under Zempl \u00e9n conditions to yield glycopolymers with the native sugar conformation (Figure 5.3).

Representative 1H-NMR (CD 3OD) spectra of acetylated and deacetylated diblock glycopolymer (50% Man). 82 3.2. Characterization of polymer micelles Based on a previous report of a similar diblock copolymer series [72], it was hypothesized that the polymers would organize into micelles in aqu eous solution , with the hydrophobic DEAEMA - co-BMA segment sequestered in the micelle core. This hypothesis was supported by DLS analysis indicating that polymers in DPBS formed 12 -17 nm particles, a size range consistent with micellar organization (Table 5.2). Subsequently, a hemolysis assay wa s performed to confirm that these micelles exhibited the ability to disrupt cell membranes under endolysosomal pH conditions (Figure 5.4). As expected, all polymers were inert under physiological conditions (pH 7.4 , 7.0), but transitioned sharply to high levels of hemolytic activity under acidic conditions (pH 6.6, 6.2, 5.8) . These findings confirm that modification of the micelle corona with mannose, galactose, or PEG does not affect the pH -response of the endosom olytic micelle core. Table 5.2.

Data are from a single experiment conducted in triplicate \u00b1 standard deviation. 3.3. Lectin bin ding activity by mannosylated glycopolymers To confirm that the mannosylated capabilities (25 -100% Man) exhibited binding to ConA, as indicated by an increase in solution turbidity , with higher ManEMA content correlating to a greater degree of agglutination ( Figure 5.5). Neither 0% Man nor Gal, which contained DMAEMA and GalEMA in the ir micelle corona s, respectively, demonstrated any binding activity (data not shown f or Gal). These results confirm that the mannosylated glycopolymers are uniquely capable of binding mannose -specific lectins. 84 Figure 5.5. Time -dependent glyc opolymers (50 g/mL) were combined, and agglutination activity quantified based on changes in absorbance at 350 nm. 3.4. Characterization of pDNA polyplexes pDNA polyplexes were formulated by combining polymers with at a fixed weight ratio (9:1 po lymer:pDNA). DLS analysis confirmed that all polymers were capable of condensing pDNA into particulate polyplexes ranging from 87 -200 nm in diameter (Table 5.2). This result was further validated by a gel retardation assay demonstrating complete retention of pDNA by 0% and 100% Man at this polymer:pDNA ratio (data not shown) . Interestingly, polyplex formation was observed in polymers lacking DMAEMA in the micelle corona (100% Man, Gal, PEG), suggesting that the tertiary amines from DEAEMA in the micelle core are also available for pDNA complexation. These DEAEMA groups do not appear to contribute to polyplex surface charge, as z eta potential measurements were positive only for polymers containing DMAEMA (0 -75% Man). The zeta potential decreased with increasing ManEMA incorporation , while p olymers completely lacking DMAEMA were neutral (100% Man, G al) or slightly anionic (PEG). 85 3.5. In vitro transfection and BMDC maturation An in vitro pDNA ated with cells for 24 h prior to analysis of cell lysate s for GFP fluorescence. While 0% Man polyplexes mediated GFP transfection to the Lipofectamine 200 0 (LF) positive control, glycopolymers with higher ManEMA incorporation perfor med poorly, with 50% Man, 75% Man, and 100% Man not differing significantly from the negative control ( Figure 5.6). Overall, these results indicate that for in vitro gene delivery, DMAEMA plays a critical role that cannot be replicated by the potential glycotargeting effects of ManEMA . Figure 5.6. In vitro RAW 264.7 macrophages mediated by pDNA polyplexes . Cells were treated with pDNA polyplexes for 24 h, then lysed and analyzed for total GFP fluorescence. Cells receiving no treatment (NT) and treatment with Lipofectamine 2000 (LF) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. 0% Man and 25% Man are significantly different from NT (p < 0.05). Data are from a single experiment conducted in triplicate \u00b1 standard deviation. 86 To determine whether the polymers developed in this study could induce DC maturation, murine BMDCs were cultured for 24 h in the presence of polyme r micelles or pDNA polyplexes, then analyzed for the expression of CD80 and CD86. Expression levels for polymer -treated cells were comparable to untreated negative controls, indicating that none of the polymers stimulated BMDC mat uration ( Figure 5.7A, B). 3.6. In vivo transfection To evaluate the efficacy of polymers for in vivo gene delivery, luciferase pDNA was administered to mice via subcutaneous injection in polyplexes or as free pDNA . 24 h post - injection, live animal imagi ng was used to assess the e xtent of luciferase expression. Luciferase activity was observed at the injection site for animals treated with free pDNA, 100% Man, Gal, and PEG , while no signal was observed in animals treated with 0% Man and 50% Man ( Figure 5.8A). Transfection levels were highly variable between individual animals in the free pDNA, 100% Man, and Gal groups , such that the only significant differences (p < 0.05) observed were between free pDNA and the mannosylated polyplexes ( Figure 5.8B). These findings suggest that a cationic surface charge is detrimental for in vivo gene delivery, as polyplexes formed from 0% Man and 50% Man, both of which had positive zeta potentials due to incorporation of DMAEMA, failed to generate any detectable gene expression. 100% Man, Gal, and PEG polyplexes, which were neutral or anionic, successfully mediated in vivo transfection, although the mean luminescence signal from these groups was lower than the mean signal produced by free pDNA. 87 Figure 5.7. In vit ro BMDC maturation were incubated with BMDCs for 24 h. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of (A) CD80 and (B) CD86 as markers for DC maturation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/mL) was used as a positive control. Data are normalized to untreated negative controls and are from a single experiment conducted in triplicate \u00b1 standard deviation. 88 Figure 5.8. In vivo luciferase transfection mediated by pDNA polyplexes. Mice were with 5 g free pDNA or pDNA polyplexes (n = 3 -12 mice per group). (A) Representative luminescence images of mice at 24 h post -injection. (B) Average luminescence signal at the injection site at 24 h. pDNA is significantly different from 0% Man, 50% Man, and 100% Man (p < 0.05). 89 3.7. Polyplex t rafficking to DCs in draining lymph nodes Since antigen presentation by DCs to T cells in the lymph nodes is a prerequisite to the initiation of adaptive immunity , a trafficking study with Cy5 -labeled pDNA was performed to determine whether polyplexes could mediate delivery to DCs in the lymph nodes. Based on the size range of the polyplexes (87 -200 nm), it was anticipated that lymph node localization would occur primarily via active trafficking by DCs from the injection site [141-143], and thus the inguinal lymph nodes were analyzed 24 h post -injection to capture this population [141] . Polyplexes formulate d with 100% Man frequencies of Cy5+ CD11c+ MHCII+ DCs (13.7%), a free pDNA (5.2%) 0% Man (< 1%) and 50% Man (< 1%) (Figure 5.9). High levels of lymph node DC uptake were also observed wi th Gal polyplexes (10.2%). Although Gal was not significantly different than 100% Man due to variability within each group, the maximum response for 100% Man was nearly 2 -fold higher than the maximum for Gal (23.8% vs. 13.5%) . Overall, these findings ind icate that micelles enhance pDNA delivery to lymph node DCs , and that incorporation of mannose as a DC-targeting ligand may further improve trafficking efficacy. Additionally, in accordance with in vivo transfection results , shielding of cati onic polyplex charge is critical for lymph node delivery, as micelles containing DMAEMA groups performed poorly compared to all other polyplex formulations and free pDNA . 90 Figure 5.9. pDNA polyplex trafficking to DCs in the draining lymph nodes. Polyplexes were formulated with 5 g Cy5 pDNA and administered via subcutaneous injection (n = 6 -12 mice per group). At 24 h post -injection, inguinal lymph nodes were isolated and the frequency of Cy5+ CD11c+ MHCII+ DCs was determined by flow cytometry. Percent uptake was found to be significantly different for the 100% Man polyplexes as compared to free pDNA, 0% Man, 50% Man, and PEG, while uptake mediated by Gal polyplexes was significantly diff erent from free pDNA, 0% Man, and 50% Man (p < 0.05). Uptake mediated by PEG polyplexes was not significant compared to free pDNA. 3.8. Evaluation of immune responses following pDNA vaccination Based on the lymph node trafficking results, 100% Man, Gal, and PEG polyplexes were further evaluated for efficacy in a pDNA immunization study. Mice received three doses of ovalbumin pDNA at weekly intervals via subcutaneous injection, and were assessed for antibody and T cell responses on day 20 and 21, respect ively. No response was observed in any of the experimental groups following in vitro splenocyte restimulation and intracellular cytokine staining (data not 91 shown), suggesting that sensitivity of the assay may be insufficient for this study. Analysis of ovalbumin -specific serum IgG levels revealed that 100% Man generated the highest antibody responses (50.0 ng/mL) compared to free pDNA (12.9 ng/mL), Gal (11.1 ng/mL), and PEG (15.3 ng/mL) (Figure 5.10). While the high variability within the 100% Man group underscores the need for additional studies to validate this data, these preliminary results suggest that the use of mannosylated polyplexes for pDNA vaccine delivery can increase . with 20 g ovalbumin pDNA and injected subcutaneously on d ay 0, 7, and 14 (n = 3 - 5 mice per group). Serum samples were collected on d ay 20 and analyzed for anti -ovalbumin IgG by ELISA. 92 4. Discussion RAFT -based glycopolymers are a highly promising approach for achieving targeted delivery of pDNA vaccines , but studies evaluating the in vivo performance of these systems are rare. Here , the development of a series of diblock copolymer micelles inc orporating (1) varyin g DMAEMA, (2) GalEMA, or (3) PEGMA in the micelle corona is reported . This series was designed to investigate the effect of mannose glycotargeting on pDNA delivery in vivo. The core segment of these micelles utilized a pH -responsive copolymer of DEAEMA and BMA that had been previously described for in vitro pDNA delivery [72]. Polymeric gene delivery vehicles typically incorporate polycation s for the electrostatic condensation of nucleic acids in order to confer protection against n uclease degradation and improve cellular uptake efficiency [26]. DMAEMA -based polymers have been successfully used for the in vitro delivery of a variety of nucleic acid while polycations have been shown to be extremely effective for in vitro models of transfection, recent reports sugges t that cationic systems may actually be disadvantageous for in vivo delivery. Van den Berg et al. compared the expression of cationic lipoplexes and polyplexes in vitro and in vivo , and observed that while these vehicles generated high levels of expression in cell culture models, expression levels following intradermal administration proved to be sig nificantly lower than that of naked pDNA [133] . PEGylation wa s sufficient to recover antigen expression and induction of antigen -specific T cell responses. The work of Palumbo et al. suggests that this discrepancy may be attributable to the tendency of highly cationic polyplexes to form impenetrable aggregates when injected in the skin, reducing the accessibility of the pDNA cargo for cellular uptake and transfection [135] . 93 The findings here corroborate these studies. In an in vitro transfection assay using RAW 264.7 macrophages as a model APC cell line, observed transfection levels correlated negatively with increasing mannosylation and decreasing cationic charge. Although these mannose glycopolymers have been previously demonstrated to enhance in vitro and in vivo uptake by APCs [170] , it appears that polycation -mediated cellular internalization is a stronger determinant of successful in vitro transfection. However , the exact opposite trend was observed when these polymers were evaluated for subcutaneous delivery in mice: a ll polyplexes incorporating DMAEMA failed to generat detectable transfection, while mannosylated, galactosylated, and PEGylated polyplexes, which exhibited neutral or negative zeta potentials, successfully mediated expression . Unexpectedly, free pDNA produced the highest levels of in vivo transfection , despite being consistently ineffective in vitro (unpublished observations) . Phua et al. observed a similar phenomenon when comparing naked mRNA to nanopart iculate mRNA, but noted that this trend only held for subcutaneous delivery, suggesting that this delivery route may be less favorable for materials -mediated transfection [136] . For vaccination applications, however, the link between local tissue transfection and immunogenicity is unclear. While it is possible that transfected \"bystander\" cells such as fibrobl asts and keratinocytes may produce antigen for subsequent capture by DCs [5], achieving direct vaccine targeting to DCs remains the most certain method for inducing an immune response. Therefore, the vaccine potential of the glycopolymers was evalu ated by investigating the efficacy of pDNA delivery to DCs in the draining lymph nodes. Polyplexes formulated with the 100% Man polymer demonstrated the highest uptake by lymph node DCs, outperforming free pDNA and PEGylated polyplexes by 2.6 - and 2.1 -fold, respectively. This is the first report of a 94 RAFT glycopolymer being used to enhance pDNA delivery to DCs in the lymph node. No uptake was observed for cationic polyplexes, further validating previous observations on the poor in delivery character istics of polycations. Intriguingly , DC uptake rates comparable to mannosylated polyplexes, although the maximum uptake frequency for mannose was considerably higher than the maximum for galactose , suggesting that man nose glycotargeting may provide some additional benefit. While mannose has been the primary carbohydrate ligand explored for DC targeting, galactose may also play a role: the macrophage galactose galactose -related structures [173,174] . These findings indicate that RAFT -based glycopolymers are a highly promising platform for enhancing in vivo pDNA delivery for vaccination applications. Most recently, preliminary immunization studies demonstrated the potential of mannosylated micelles for inducing antigen - specific antibody responses. Recommendations for future studies are to (1) further chara cterize the in vivo activity of glycopolymer polyplexes, quantifying uptake by specific DC subsets and in situ DC transfection, (2) optimize immunization protocols to increase the immunogenicity of glycopolymer polyplex vaccines , and (3) investigate the ap plication of this delivery platform for use with other vaccine therapeutics, such as mRNA . 5. Conclusions Achieving targeted delivery to DCs is a highly promising approach for improving the efficacy of pDNA vaccines. RAFT synthesis was used to develop a series of glycopolymer micelles 95 incorporating pendent mannose groups for DCs. Micelles incorporated a pH-responsive DEAEMA -co-BMA core segment to enable cytosolic delivery of the pDNA cargo. Following subcutaneous administration, gly cotargeted polyplexes exhibited superior local tissue transfection and trafficking to lymph node DCs compared to conventional cationic polyplexes, demonstrating the potential of this platform for the delivery of pDNA vaccine therapeutics. 96 Chapter 6 Overa ll conclusions 1. Summary of findings Nucleic acid vaccine technology holds significant potential as a versatile strategy for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. Numerous research efforts have focused on improving the clinical performance of the se therapeutics through the use of carrier systems to facilitate vaccine delivery to DCs. The goal of this work was to utilize RAFT synthetic methodologies t o develop block copolymers for the delivery of two classes of nucleic acid therapeutics, mRNA and pDNA, and evaluate their in vitro and in vivo performance as vaccine vehicles . 1.1. Development of multifunctional block copolymers for mRNA delivery mRNA is generating enormous rese arch interest as an alternative to pDNA for nucleic acid - based vaccination strategies, but the existing literature on mRNA -specific delivery strategies is limited. A series of multifunctional block copolymers were developed in order to explore the effect of varying polymer architectures on mRNA delivery efficacy. These polymers were composed of three discrete segments: (1) DMAEMA for the electrostatic condensation of mRNA, (2) PEGMA for improving polyplex stability and biocompatibility, and (3) DEAEMA - co-BMA for enhancement of endolysosomal escape. In in vitro studies, the D-P-E blocking order was observed to be particularly favorable for intracellular delivery to hard -to-transfect APCs , a phenomenon that appeared to be correlated with the increased polyp lex stability conferred by this polymer architecture. Furthermore, these polymers demonstrated the ability to 97 deliver a model mRNA vaccine vector to DCs for presentation and activation of T cells, a promising result that motivated the decision to investig ate these polymers for in vivo delivery. However, the performance of these mRNA polyplexes in mouse models was unsatisfactory. Initial studies indicated that, following subcutaneous administration, mRNA polyplexes failed to mediate any observable local t issue transfection or mediate mRNA trafficking to lymph node DCs. Hypothetically, the incorporation of PEGMA to reduce cationic charge might be sufficient to improve in vivo delivery efficacy [133] , but the findings here indicate that more significant refinements in polymer design are needed . 1.2. Evaluation of glycopolymer micelles for in vivo pDNA vaccine delivery Glycotargeted polymer vehicles are a promising approach for enhancing vaccine delivery to DCs, the primary cell type of interest for vaccination -based therapies. A series of glycopolymer micelles were developed with DEAEMA -co-BMA in the micelle and varying corona compositions: (1) ManEMA copolymerized with DMAEMA at varying molar ratios, (2) GalEMA as an untargeted glycopolymer control, and (3) PEGMA, as an untargeted nonglycosylated control. Initially, in vitro transfection results suggested that mannosylated polyplexes performed poorly relative to traditional cationic polyplexes. However, when applied to mice via subcutaneous successfully mediated Furthermore, mannosylated galactosylated polyplexes exhibited superior trafficking to lymph node DCs compared to uncomplexed pDNA, indicating that glycotargeted micelles were capable of enhanc ing vaccine deliv ery to immunologically relevant cell types. Most recently, a preliminary immunization study demonstrated that mannosylated polyplexes induced higher antigen -specific humoral responses 98 compared to free pDNA and other polyplex formulations. These findings indicate that mannosylated polymer micelles are a promising platform for the in vivo delivery of pDNA and other nucleic acid vaccine therapeutics. 2. Conclusions 2.1. Utility of RAFT -based block co polymers as multifunctional delivery vehicles These studie s demonstrate the versatility of the RAFT synthetic methodology for the development of well-defined gene delivery vectors with complex architectures . A wide variety of polymer designs were investigated, and the findings confirmed that the resultant block copolymers exhibited the expected functional activities , e.g. pH-triggered membrane disruption, enhancement of polyplex stability, recognition of carbohydrate -specific lectins . Future work with RAFT -based vehicles could potentially explore other functionalities that would further improve vaccine efficacy, such as co -delivery of adjuvants for increased immunogenicity or incorporation of biodegradable segments for controlled release of the nucleic acid cargo. 2.2. Design consideration s for polymeric gene delivery systems In this work, the most successful delivery vectors incorporated neutral hydrophilic monomers that reduced the overall cationic charge . The PEGMA triblock copolymers, although ultimately unsuccessful for in vivo delivery, demonstrated superior polyplex stability and mRNA transfection in vitro compared to their unPEGylated counterpart significantly, mannosylated transfection and delivery to lymph node DCs. These findings have important implications for 99 gene delivery vector design given that the majority of polymeric carrier systems currently described in the literature are highly cationic. While such vehicles may be effective in cell culture models , the studies here indicate that cationic surface charge is detrimental for gene delivery in vivo , an observation that has been corroborated by other groups [133,135] . These results suggest a more promising polymer design: the glycopolymer micelle s contain cationic units in the micelle core, but not the corona, thus enabling nucleic acid condensation while maintai ning a neutral zeta potential. An important caveat to be noted is that neutralization of cationic charge can adversely affect vaccine efficacy . Carstens et al . observed that while PEGylated liposomes demonstrated enhanced lymphatic trafficking, th ey did not generate higher immune responses, potentially due to reduced residence times in the lymph nodes [175] . The incorporation of DC targeting functio nalities or vaccine adjuvants may be necessary in order to achieve an optimal balance between favorable in vivo biodistribution and sufficient vaccine immunogenicity. The mannosylated glycopolymers developed here appear to fulfill both criteria, by mediat ing improved pDNA delivery to lymph node DCs as well as eliciting higher humoral responses . Based on these promising findings , the mannosylated glycopolymer design merit s further investigation in order to optimize its immunization efficacy and explore its potential for the delivery of other nucleic acid therapeutics. 100 References 1.
