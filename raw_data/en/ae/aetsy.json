Plant Therapy Essential Oils These oils are so handy to add to your \"medicine cabinet\" or purse. Not only are they natural and smell amazing, but they also help aid the body in healing without any of the common icky side effects we're used to seeing from over-the-counter meds. Look for webinars, classes, and future blog posts on how you can use these amazing oils yourself! Earthley Wellness Products Next in our exciting announcements is Earthley. If you're not familiar with Earthley (no, that's not a typo ), They believe that health is sacred and so very personal. That every individual should be empowered to care for themselves...at least, most of the time. At TrueNorth Chiropractic, we're thrilled to be offering you quality products from amazing brands, such as Earthley. There will be more than a dozen natural salves, herbal extracts, etc... to choose from that we're sure you will love! The best part about buying from us is that you get the same amazing products at the same price, but without having to pay shipping.... and did we mention, you get to support a super awesome local business too :) Modalities Have you heard us talk about modalities at the clinic before? Well, we love what they offer to our patients. Brand new at the clinic is what we like to call the VibePlate! The VibePlate's vibration therapy will accelerate the healing process, improve muscle tone, balance, flexibility, and so much more! New Kingdom Healthcare [New Kingdom Healthcare](https://newkingdomwellness.com/) will be practicing out of our office, starting Tuesday, May 4th!

[Call (952) 999-0333 ](tel:+19529990333)to schedule your appointment and let them know you want the North Branch location. New Faces You'll be seeing a couple of new faces in the office!!!
