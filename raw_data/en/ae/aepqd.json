Most of us live busy lives, doing the best we can to juggle work, friendships, relationships, commuting, going to the gym or to yoga classes, some of us even study or find time for hobbies on top of that. Finding the time to think about what we could do to help our bodies to prepare for pregnancy can be tricky, and it can be difficult to know where to start. But there are things that we can do to help ourselves to prepare our bodies, and I hope these ideas are helpful to you. Please however remember, in reading these, that you are 100% fully accountable for and responsible for any decisions you make regarding your health, and you must always consult with your doctor about any changes to medication you are being prescribed, or because of any health concerns or issues that you might have. Have a think about your diet, and how helpful it is to creating a healthy environment for a little one. There are 3 things I would reallllly recommend, no matter what else you do: a) If you eat meat and dairy, please please please go organic. Non-organic meat contains antibiotics, growth hormones and GMOs. Antibiotics destroy healthy gut bacteria. Around 80% of our immune health is dependent on a healthy gut, and 80% of our serotonin production (which helps us feel happy) happens in the gut - and needs healthy gut bacteria in order to be produced. So every time you eat non-organic meat or dairy, antibiotics may be affecting your gut health, and growth hormones may be affecting the balance of your hormones. Whilst antibiotics may be genuinely necessary for you at some point in your life, getting these from food isn't going to help your body. If you can go organic with everything else, then great - a pesticide free body is one that a baby would love to grown in! b) Drink hormone-free water. That means don't drink tap water. Decades of women peeing out the contraceptive pill means that there are high levels of oestrogen in the water supply (and did you know cocaine is in the top 5 ingredients in tap water too?!). Either buy water in glass bottles (not plastic), or use a filter that can remove hormones and pharmaceuticals. One filter to look at is the [AcalaQuell](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AcalaQuell-Reservoir-Capacity-Filtration-Technology/dp/B01BJ9AQFY). c) Eat lots of organic fresh fruit and veg - try an organic green smoothie a day, and help your way to health. Start taking a [really good prenatal supplement](http://www.terranovahealth.com/product/terranova-prenatal-multivitamin/). I particularly like the Terra Nova brand - they use foods that compliment the vitamins and minerals, to help your body utilise the nutrients more easily, instead of cheap fillers. And most of the foods are grown on a biodynamic organic farm, started by a former NASA rocket scientist who uses the same freeze-drying process to capture all the nutrients in ways that are done so astronauts can have nutritious meals in space. Terra Nova also produce a wonderful [Life Drink](http://www.terranovahealth.com/product/terranovalife-drink-227g/), filled with superfoods, probiotics, a prebiotic, health-promoting fungi and digestive enzymes, which is an ideal way to boost the health of your body. (I am not paid commission by them, or anyone else btw, I just genuinely love what they do!) Support your gut health - it's absolutely crucial for our health. I mention the Life Drink which contains probiotics, but do look at the balance of your gut health - your baby's immunity will come from you, so if you have a healthy gut, you will pass this on to your baby. Also, brain development comes from the gut, so if you and your baby have a healthy gut, that can help their brain health. Many people have an out of balance microbiome, so it might be worth getting your microbiome analysed. Then if anything needs addressing it can be addressed now, so your body is as healthy as it can be. If you have an unhealthy bacterial overgrowth eg SIBO, taking extra probiotics are only a good idea once this has been successfully treated.

If you don't have that budget, and don't mind waiting for shipping times to and from the US, [Viome](https://www.viome.com/?campaign=2037295805&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7aPyBRChARIsAJfWCgLRmBGtcGzn0DujIokTeMc6DnYrdps136CYZX-LVnANSe9OWJQsZ4AaAl6JEALw_wcB&keyword=microbiome%20testing&refcode=vpm_go)sometimes have an offer of $129. If you have results that show an imbalance, don't try to deal with this yourself - do go and see a good natural health practitioner, and if needs be your doctor. Your liver balances your hormones, so help your liver out! Even if we aren't massively boozy ourselves, our liver has to process a lot, from air pollution, to artificial chemicals in skincare, to pharmaceutical drugs, to additives in processed foods. A great supplement to take is [Milk Thistle](http://www.terranovahealth.com/product/terranova-fresh-freeze-dried-milk-thistle-500mg/). It has been found to literally regenerate the liver! [Gingko Biloba](http://www.terranovahealth.com/product/terranova-fresh-freeze-dried-ginko-leaf-500mg-organic/)can also be a great addition, because it helps to open the capillaries, so any toxins can leave the body more easily. You might even want to cleanse your liver - I really like the [Liver Rescue](https://www.medicalmedium.com/liver-rescue)book by Anthony William. Move to using only 100% natural toiletries, cleaning products and make-up. Synthetic perfumes and ingredients in standard toiletries can affect hormones, and some have been linked with cancers. So help your body and your immunity by making the switch, there are so many brilliant natural alternatives now, and I write more about all of this in my book [Nature's Medicine Code](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Natures-Medicine-Code-Food-About-ebook/dp/B07C18TM15/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=danica%20apolline%20natures%20medicine%20code&qid=1581882899&sr=8-1). Evaluate your life - is there any part of your life that feels out of balance? With work, or friendships, or even in your relationship? What can you do to bring yourself more happiness or joy? Maybe taking up meditation for even 10 minutes a day can help create some space in our lives just for us. There is a great app - [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com)that teaches this for free. See a great natural health practitioner. I am biased as a homeopathy student, because I see great results using it with my patients, and I explain [what it is and how it works](https://www.danicaapolline.co.uk/what-is-homeopathy-1)here, but you may be drawn to a naturopath, or herbalist or nutritionist, or a TCM practitioner, or an acupuncturist. Find someone you feel you can trust, and who you resonate with, and support your health with the knowledge and experience they can share with you. Make sure your phone and router are not 5G enabled, and turn them off at night at home. There is lots of scientific evidence to show that too much EMF can be damaging to the development of healthy bodies and healthy brains, and 5G is set to many times the levels of EMF radiation that we know can cause harm. There are things you can do to protect yourself and those you love, but do make sure your phone and router are not 5G enabled, and do turn them off at night. Some say wearing a necklace or bracelet made of shungite offers protection from EMF radiation. If you would like to find out more, please do take a look at the work of [Phire Medical](https://www.phiremedical.org), started by Dr Elizabeth Evans, a former A&E consultant who has done a ton of research into this. Finally, I know it's easy to say in our busy lives, but rest. It's nature's greatest medicine, and if let our body rest, it can relax more. Spend more time lounging about in your PJs with your partner, watching great films, seeing friends, having a lovely massage or reflexology treatment, having holidays If you can - whatever it is that makes you feel rested. Everything you do - get your partner to do the same. Having him produce the happiest healthiest sperm will help you conceive. Long gone are the days when we thought of fertility as just about the woman - both of you have a part to play, and that includes at this stage too! I'd like to finish by sharing a little of my own story, because I hope it will help in some way, as someone who was told it would be very difficult for me to conceive. I always wanted to have children. I LOVE babies. Just LOVE them. I think they're gorgeous and cute and adorable and funny. My school friends would joke about how I was forever to be found saying \"BAAAAAABBBYYYYYY!\" whenever I spotted one when we were out in the shopping centre together. I think it was because I had the joy of having a kid sister who was born when I was 11 years old. And I adored her. So I just assumed that it would all work out easily. I'd finish my education, get a good job, meet the man of my dreams, and settle down and have at least 3 children. But, as we know, life doesn't always work out quite how we imagine. I had been on the pill from the age of 15 to 23. Once I came off it, my periods didn't settle down, and I had a long cycle. After 3 very unusual periods, I went to see a gynaecologist who sent me for tests, and told me that it would be difficult for me to have a baby - that I didn't ovulate properly; in fact that I only ovulated rarely. In a remarkable moment of perception, she asked if anything had happened in my life around the time I came off the pill. \"Yes. My Mum was diagnosed with cancer\". \"Well that's it then\", the gynaecologist said. \"Your body went into shock. That's why you rarely ovulate\". So that was it. I thought it would be hard to conceive - in fact, I told myself it would be damn near impossible. I tried to conceive with my ex husband for a year, but to no avail. I felt the utter desperation of a woman obsessed with having a child. My body ached at times for a baby - I felt I had a baby-shaped hole in my soul. We didn't make it as a couple, and a separation and divorce happened not long after. I then went on a journey of healing, and health - not with a view to having a child - but for myself. A couple of years after my divorce, I met a guy. We hadn't been together long, and we weren't trying for a baby, but my son decided to head on over Earthside. It happened so easily, and so quickly, and finding myself pregnant was a shock. But I look at our lives - my child, and me and who his Dad is, and his journey through life, and I am reminded of something that is taught in some ancient wisdoms, that I share in my book [Born Feisty](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Born-Feisty-Experience-suicide-purpose/dp/0957572166/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=danica%20apolline%20born%20feisty&qid=1581879821&sr=8-1). I share a bit of what's in there here. \"I really feel that we have a time to be born and a time to die......I would like to explain a few wisdoms about birth, because I think they are linked and related. Before I do, can I just tell you something? As you will have read, I love science. I am secretly a bit of a nerd. I used to think that the things I am about to talk about - about spirituality and the soul - were an irrelevance at best. I have come to realise....... that we live in a world of possibilities; that there is a place for science, but there is also a place for ancient traditions and wisdom, and truths can be found in both, and I have learned to have an open mind, that still questions, but that understands that there is more to life than our modern approach science can explain on its own..... Older anthroposophical, tribal and ancient religious traditions believe that we are each born at the perfect moment for us, in the perfect way, place and time. At the moment of our birth, as we look directly up at the sky from the place we have been born, there is a map in the stars that describes who we are, the strengths and gifts we bring, some of the challenges we have chosen to face. In order to be the people who we have chosen to be, we have to be born at a specific time, in a specific location in the world, so that the stars and planets can be mapped with the energies that we will be literally imprinted with, in order to express who we have chosen to be, and to make the differences we have decided to make. I used to think Astrology was rubbish, and still don't think much about daily horoscopes, but someone explained to me what an astrological birth chart actually was, and this actually made complete sense to me. Wise and ancient teachers such as the Ancient Greek Pythagoras used to teach Astrology as well as Science, Mathematics, Music, Astronomy - all subjects that were once upon time understood to be related to one another, not separate and distinct, as we have in our world. An astrological birth chart is this. At the moment we are born, in the place on the Earth we are born, if we look straight up at the sky, the planets and the stars will be mapped in a very specific way. It is a picture unique to that moment, and a baby born at the same time somewhere else in the world will have a different map, unique to them, above them. I love the work of the hypnotherapist Michael Newton, author of Life Between Lives and Journey of Souls. He is a hypnotherapist who didn't believe in anything beyond this world, and specialised in helping people stop smoking and losing weight. The thing was, his clients during his sessions kept going to some place that he thought was strange, a place where they were choosing their next life. After over a hundred clients visited this space, reporting exactly the same process of choosing our lives, personalities, bodies and key relationships, he realised he had better start paying attention. They were clearly reporting something significant and meaningful.\" One thing seeing the journey of my son's life - and indeed my own - has taught me that I believe these anthroposophical and ancient wisdoms to be true. We choose who we are before we come, and in order to be born at the perfect moment, with that perfect map of the stars and planets above us, to the perfect parents for us to grow and learn, we have be conceived at exactly the right moment, so that we are born at the perfect to have that map reflect who we would like to be. I wish someone had explained that to me when I was feeling desperate. I put so much pressure on myself to do \"everything right\", and then blamed myself when I couldn't conceive. Now I understand I wasn't meant to back then, that life had other plans and adventures ahead of me, and that it wasn't down to me to choose when I was ready - it was down to my son. He came when he was ready; when it was his time - and nothing I did could have changed that. There are so many stories of women who've had lots of rounds of IVF, to only then conceive when they'd given up. Or women who've conceived at weird times of the month - not when they were ovulating. Or women who conceived even though they were taking the pill diligently. Or women who naturally conceived their own baby as soon as their adopted baby arrived. Miracles happen all the time, we just forget to see them - or to believe that they may be possible for us. I believe miracles are possible for everyone. Of course, some children arrive because of IVF, or assisted conception in some way, and some help may be needed particularly for same-sex couples. But I also wonder what would happen if we trusted a little more that things would work out a little more easily. In sharing this, my hope and wish is that you will use this an invitation to relax; to enjoy the process and journey of getting closer with your partner, having lots of sex that makes you both happy, that is fun and not set to a time of the month - that is about connection and love and togetherness and joy. And when your little one is ready, you'll know :) Good luck! x "}
