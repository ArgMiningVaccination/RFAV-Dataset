If you are an Oregon school, childcare, preschool or other educational facility that wishes to receive student immunization histories through a data exchange connection between your Student Information System and ALERT IIS, you'll find information specific to your interests on the [school system data exchange page](/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/ALERT/Pages/SchDataExch.aspx). Onboarding for data exchange with ALERT IIS happens in three phases. A smooth and successful onboarding process is dependent on the availability of your EHR vendor technical resources, availability of clinic staff to help find resolution to data quality issues discovered in testing and the ability of your EHR system to create and send electronic data according to national standards. The onboarding process may take anywhere from 8-12 weeks. Most steps and phases of onboarding will require participation by a primary contact from the clinic and the EHR vendor and/or IT staff. Below is an overview of the onboarding process. Please read each phase in full and when your organization is ready to begin the process for electronic submission of data, or is already sending but needs to make a change, please complete the registration form as the first step in the process: [Data Exchange Registration Form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/e04a57de1f1044a5927345ce3df13a9e) Phase 1: Planning & Discovery - Assure that all sites interested in data exchange are enrolled in [ALERT IIS](https://www.alertiis.org/ORPRD/portalInfoManager.do) and have an [established site agreement](https://immalert.oha.oregon.gov/) with ALERT IIS. - Review data exchange documentation provided below with your EHR vendor and/or IT staff - [ALERT IIS Readiness Checklist](/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/ALERT/Documents/DataExchange/ALERTDXReadinessChecklist.pdf) - [ALERT IIS DX Questionnaire](/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/ALERT/Documents/DataExchange/ALERTDXQuestionnaire.xlsx) - [Oregon Onboarding Process Guide](/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/ALERT/Documents/DataExchange/ALERTDXOnboardingGuide.pdf) - [Real Time Data Guide v3.0](/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/ALERT/Documents/DataExchange/realtimespec.pdf) (pdf) - [Oregon Specific HL7 Implementation Guide](/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/ALERT/Documents/DataExchange/ALERTDXImplementationGuide.pdf) (IG) - [CDC National HL7 Implementation Guide](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/technical-guidance/hl7.html) (IG) - Complete dx registration form (link above) to be added to project queue and be assigned an ALERT onboarding analyst. Phase 2: Development & Testing ALERT IIS Data Exchange Analyst will schedule a kick-off call - Sites planning to do real time messaging via SOAP web service will be set up with web service credentials - Live data should be submitted to the IIS test region in order to identify any format or data content issues. - Testing continues for a minimum of two consecutive weeks of messages with nominal critical errors, failures, or significant issues, or until data format and/or data quality issues have been resolved and messages are processing error-free Review the - Two-week testing is a flexible timeline, but is at the discretion of the ALERT IIS Onboarding Data Exchange Analyst. [AIRA Guidance for HL7 Ack Messages](/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/ALERT/Documents/DataExchange/ALERTHL7Guidance.pdf) (pdf) to understand the response message that is received from ALERT IIS.If testing cannot be completed in the ALERT IIS test region, it is recommended vendors use the NIST Testing Tool to test HL7 message format and send report of results to ALERT Onboarding Analyst. Phase 3: Implementation & Go-Live - Final review of data with Data Exchange Analyst requires clinic staff to confirm data sent is complete and accurate. - Discuss reports available in ALERT IIS to be used by the clinic to monitor ongoing data exchange. - Schedule Go-live date Other Options for Data Exchange There are a variety of different option for submitting data to the ALERT Immunization System (IIS). The following specifications will help you determine which format will work best to send data to ALERT IIS. User Interface File Formats - ALERT IIS has an intuitive user interface that can be used for entering demographic and immunization information in real time. Any updates to a patient's immunization record will immediately update the forecast of immunizations due. To access ALERT IIS, users must complete a basic training. [Access standard user training here](/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/ALERT/Pages/TrainStandard.aspx) State Supplied Vaccine Reporting Requirements For organizations that are receiving Oregon's state-supplied vaccines: Patient vaccine eligibility codes must be reported for every state-supplied vaccine administered to a patient, including SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine. The code to use for pandemic response vaccines, such as COVID-19 vaccine, is ORA01 (S= Special Projects). Please add to the OBX segment.Oregon has two state specific eligibility codes. Eligibility codes must be collected for patients of all ages at the vaccine level: - State supplied vaccination data must be submitted within 14 days of vaccine administration. - COVID-19 vaccination data must be submitted within 24 to 48 hours of vaccine administration, - Providers approved to receive and administer state supplied vaccine should include the following data in the HL7 data "}
