Rice1* An estimated 71 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The lack of small-animal models has impeded studies of antiviral immune mechanisms.Here we show that an HCV-related hepacivirus discovered in Norway rats can establish high-titer hepatotropic infections in laboratory mice with immunological features resembling those seen in human viral hepatitis. Whereas immune-compromised micedeveloped persistent infection, immune-competent mice cleared the virus within 3 to5 weeks. Acute clearance was T cell dependent and associated with liver injury. Transient depletion of CD4 +T cells before infection resulted in chronic infection, characterized by high levels of intrahepatic regulatory T cells and expression of inhibitory molecules on intrahepatic CD8+T cells. Natural killer cells controlled early infection but were not essential for viral clearance. This model may provide mechanistic insights into hepatic antiviral immunity, a prerequisite for the development of HCV vaccines. Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of human liver cirrhosis and cancer, is nar-rowly restricted to the human liver ( 1). Cur- rently, there are no immune-competent small-animal models for HCV, and this limits the study of host-virus interactions and the development of vaccine strategies ( 2). A prophy- lactic and protective vaccine against HCV, which will likely be needed for global HCV eradication, does not exist ( 3). Several HCV-related hepaciviruses have been discovered in horses, bats, and wild rodents ( 4). In 2014, a hepacivirus was identified in Norwayrats from New York City ( 5) and named Norway rat hepacivirus (NrHV) or rodent hepacivirus-nr-1 (RHV-nr-1). Similar to HCV in NrHV can establish a hepatotropic infection in rats ( 5). Rats represent a natural context in which to study NrHV.However, given numerous genetic variants and tools available for mice that permit deep mecha- nistic studies, we aimed to develop a mouse modelof NrHV infection, speculating that NrHV mightinfect laboratory mice, given their close phyloge- netic relationship to rats.We first explored whether NrHV could establish infection in tl a c ka d a p t - ive immunity, type I, and type I/II interferon(IFN) signaling, respectively. We infected 4-week-o l dm i c ei n t r a v e n o u s l yw i t h1 0 4genome equiva- lents (GE) of NrHV derived from the serum of an infected laboratory rat. NrHV established a high- titer (106to 108GE per milliliter of serum) chronic infection in these mice (Fig. 1A). Mice lacking MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) cleared the virus within 3 weeks postinfection (p.i.) (Fig. 1A). Intravenous infection of the immune-competent mouse 104GE resulted in cleared significantly time through NRG mice (Fig. 1B), indicating that NrHV can adapt to the mouse host. To test the extent of NrHV adapta-tion in NRG mice, we performed either 12-weekl o n g - t e r ma d a p t a t i o ni no n em o u s eo rs e r i a l - passage adaptation through five mice (4-week infection of each mouse) (fig. S1A). We then chal-lenged na\u00efve NRG and C57BL/6J mice with 9 \u00d7 10 4GE of either the pooled adapted (long-term pool or serial pool) or the parental virus. Adapted viruses showed 0.5 to 1 log higher viral titers at w e e k1p . i .a n dp e r s i s t e dl o n g e ri nC 5 7 B L / 6 Jm i c e than did the parental virus (fig. S1B), suggesting increased viral fitness in the mouse host. Comparing the consensus NrHV genome open reading frame (ORF) sequences of the rat inoc- ulum with those of the adapted viruses revealed changes in 2 and 59 nucleotide positions in thelong-term and serial-passage pool, respectively (fig. S1C). Phylogenetic an alysis of full-ORF clones revealed the presence of two subpopulations in t h ei n o c u l u m ;t h em i n o ro n ew a ss e l e c t e dd u r i n gthe serial passage (Fig. 1C and fig. S1D). Single coding mutations in viral envelope proteins E1and E2 occurred in both pools and in individualNRG mice from passage 5 of the serial adaptation (Fig. 1C, fig. S1E, and tables S1 and S2). The pool) or T195N (Thr195Asn) (long-term pool), represent puta- t i v em o u s ea d a p t i v em u t a t i o n s ,a st h e yw e r em a i n -tained in challenged C57BL/6J mice. Mutationsat amino acid position 550, combined with at least one mutation in the cluste r 361/369/370/371, were selected in NRG mice, but were immediately lost in C57BL/6J mice. Changing position 550 would dis-rupt a predicted Nx(S/T) glycosylation site (where x is any amino acid except proline), possibly de- shielding neutralization epitopes as observed forHCV ( 6). For subsequent experiments we used se- rial pool virus as our source of NrHV. Our results indicate that NrHV is both highly infectious and hepatotropic in mice. Even a low-dose infection with 10 GE resulted in high-titer v i r e m i a .T h ed o s ed i dn o ti n f l u e n c et h eo u t c o m e of infection, as mice infected with 10 4,1 03,1 02,a n d 10 GE cleared the virus with similar kinetics. Incontrast, age influenced clearance: 4-week-old mice typically cleared the virus by week 5 p.i., whereas 2- to 6-month-old mice cleared the virusby week 3 p.i. (fig. S2, A to C). We consistentlydetected high viral titers in liver tissue (10 6to 108 NrHV GE per gram of tissue) but not in spleen,k i d n e y ,a n dl u n g( F i g .1 D ) .N r H Vr e p l i c a t i o nw a sdependent on miR-122, a liver-specific microRNA required for HCV i .1 E ) . Like HCV in humans, NrHV infection was not associated with signs of acute disease or mortal- ity. Chronically infected NRG and AG129 mice showed minimal to mild liver inflammation at week 35 p.i. (fig. S3). To identify the cellular mediators of NrHV clearance, we characterized the immune response during acute resolving NrHV infection in 8-week- old C57BL/6J mice. High-titer viremia was detect-able as early as 24 hours p.i.; titers started to decline at day 15 p.i. and were undetectable at day 21 p.i. (Fig. 2A). Early acute infection (days 3to 9 p.i.) was associated with an expansion ofintrahepatic Ly6C +monocytes and NKp46+NK cells (Fig. 2B). Starting at day 9 p.i., we observed asubstantial increase in proliferating (Ki67 +)i n t r a - hepatic CD4+and CD8+T cells. These cells were characterized by a CD44+effector phenotype with an antiviral type 1 differentiation signature ( 9) as indicated by high T-bet expression and IFN-gp r o d u c t i o n( F i g .2 ,Bt oE ,a n df i g .S 4 ,Aa n dB). CD8 +T cells also showed a significant up- regulation of granzyme B (fig. S4C). The T cellresponse was predominant in the liver and lesspronounced in peripheral blood and spleen (Fig. 2 and fig. S4). High levels of intrahepatic effector T cells coincided with a decline in viremia startingat day 15 p.i. and were associated with elevatedalanine (ALT) levels (Fig. injury. confirmed by NrHV-specific IFN-g production CD8+T cells in response peptideRESEARCH Biller beck Science 357 ,204-208 (2017) 14 July 2017 1of5 1Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.2Copenhagen Hepatitis C Program (CO-HEP), Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Research Centre, Hvidovre Hospital and Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.3College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.4Center for Vaccines and Immunity, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children 's Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.5Department of Pathology, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.6Department of Pathology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.7Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. *Corresponding author.

T cells play an important role in HCV and hepa- titis B virus choriomeningitis ( 10,11). T cell depletion studies in HCV-infected chimpanzees showed that these cells are critical for viral clearance during pri- mary and secondary infection ( 12,13). To analyze if T cells play an essential role in NrHV clearance, we depleted them in mice (fig.S6, A and B). Transient CD4 +Tc e l ld e p l e t i o n initiated before infection resulted in chronicinfection (analyzed unti l day 210 p.i.) in C57BL/6J mice after the CD4 +cell popu- lation recovered. Transient CD8+T cell depletion led to delayed viral clearance as compared tocontrols (Fig. 3A and fig. S7, A and B). Mice thatwere constantly (every 10 days p.i.) depleted ofCD8 +T cells failed to clear the virus (Fig. 3B). We next analyzed NrHV infection during re- covery of CD4+or CD8+T cells after transient depletion (4 days before infection) in C57BL/6Jmice (fig. S6C). In CD8 +T cell depleted mice, intra- hepatic T cell recovery (fig. S8A) was associated with the emergence of CD44+IFN-g+effector CD8+ T cells, elevated ALT levels, and viral clearance. This was preceded by the induction of intrahepa-tic CD44 +IFN- g+CD4+T cells (fig. S8, C and D). By contrast, in CD4+Tc e l l -depleted mice, intra- hepatic cell recovery cells. The pres- ence of CD8+effector cells induced in the absence of CD4 help was not associated with elevated ALTlevels or viral clearance but resulted in chronicity(fig. S8, E and F). These results indicate that CD4 +T cells are crucial for the initiation of a successful antiviraladaptive immune response, and that CD8 +Tc e l l s are main effectors in NrHV clearance.In NrHV infection, memory CD8+T cells also limited secondary infection (Fig. 3C). Mice thathad cleared NrHV infection 4 to 7 months earlier became reinfected upon secondary challenge with the same inoculum but rapidly cleared the viruswithin 7 days (Fig. 3C). This was accompaniedby a strong NrHV-specific CD8 +T cell recall re- sponse at day 5 p.i. (Fig. 3D). When we depletedCD8 +T cells 4 days before secondary infection, mice showed higher viral titer at day 5 p.i. com-pared to controls and could not clear the second- ary infection by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 3C). Neutralizing antibodies (ntAbs) might also play a role in limiting secondary infection. We ob-served significantly lower viral titers 24 hours after reinfection as compared to primary infec-tion (Fig. 3C). During primary infection, therew a sa ni n c r e a s ei nt h en u m b e ro fh e p a t i cBc e l l s and elevated frequencies of splenic and hepatic follicular T helper cells (fig. S9, A and B).

S9D). This suggests that ntAbs are produced but at a frequency too low to complete- ly prevent NrHV reinfection. That is similar toHCV infection, where prev iously infected humans and chimpanzees can be reinfected with the sameHCV strain ( 14). We also investigated the potential role of NK cells in viral clearance. During NrHV infection, we observed increased numbers, activation (CD69 up-regulation), and IFN- gproduction of hepatic NK day 3 (Fig. 2B and fig.S 1 0 ,At oC ) .T h i sw a sa t t r i b u t e dt oa ne x p a n s i o n in the number of conventional CD49b +NK cells while the number of liver-resident CD49a+NKcells ( 15) remained stable, leading substan- tial change in the hepatic CD49b+to CD49a+NK cell ratio over the course of infection (fig. S10, D and E). NK cell depletion resulted in significantly elevated viremia at day 3 p.i.. However, the kinetics of viral clearance and the extent of liver injurywere similar in NK cell -depleted mice and controls (fig. S10, F and G). Thus, NK cells may contributeto the control of NrHV early in infection, but theyare not required for NrHV clearance. Chronic viral hepatitis in humans and chronic LCMV infection in mice are characterized byantigen-specific T cell dysfunction and exhaustion(10,11). Mechanisms contributing to this phe- nomenon include the up-regulation of checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., PD-1 (programmed cell death 1)) or suppression by regulatory Foxp3 +CD4+T cells(Tregs)(10,11). After transient CD4+T cell chronic infec-tion in immune-competent mice (Fig. 3A) thatwas associated with mild liver inflammation (fig. S11). We found that chronic infection, in contrast to acute clearance, coinc ided with the emergence of intrahepatic T regsthat remained at high levels throughout infection (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, sup-pression of antiviral immune responses by T regs might play a role in the establishment of chronicNrHV infection.

PD-1/PD-1L blockade showed mixed results when tested in HCV-infectedchimpanzees and patients, so its efficacy in thesetting of chronic viral hepatitis is still unclear (19,20). We thus tested whether PD-1L blockade could reduce viremia during chronic NrHV in- fection in mice (fig. S6D). Blockade at day 42 p.i.significantly reduced vi remia (0.5 to 1 log) at day 14 after start of treatment, whereas blockade atday 84 p.i. reduced viremia only at day 21 afterstart of treatment. At an even later time point(day 140 p.i.), no decrease in viremia was ob- served (Fig. 4, E to G, and fig. S12, B and C). These results suggest that blockade of the PD-1:PD1-Lpathway can reduce NrHV viral loads only during early chronic infection. In this study, we have developed an immune- competent inbred mouse model of an HCV-related hepacivirus. Because NrHV can adapt to infect mice with diverse genetic backgrounds, this model can potentially help unravel mechanisms of hepa-civirus host adaptation, immune evasion, and thedevelopment of liver disease. It can also be usedto select for viral variants that can establish chronicinfection in immune-competent mice. Given the similarities between NrHV infection in mice and HCV infection in humans, this model might provevaluable in the future for the development and testing of HCV vaccines.
