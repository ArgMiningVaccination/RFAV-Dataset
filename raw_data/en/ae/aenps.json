Note that this is general information and is not intended to be legal advice; you should seek legal advice in your state for detailed information. First, it is important to remember that a holistic health practitioner is not a primary care physician. Without other licensing, a holistic health practitioner cannot diagnose, treat, or prescribe drugs. If you do hold licensing in a healthcare field, please indicate this in your discussions so that your instructor can provide appropriate feedback and your fellow students can place your comments in context. Nutrition Careers If you are interested in utilizing nutrition consultation in your chosen career path, you may want to check the laws in your state for licensing nutrition professionals at: The Center for Nutrition Advocacy (http://www.nutritionadvocacy.org/). You can learn about whether Nutrition is a licensable profession where you live, as well as learn about nutrition laws in your state as they apply to herbalists, wellness coaches, and other health professionals. Each of these states has a path to a nutrition career for graduates of the ACHS MS Nutrition program as of 12/2013. Refer to state laws for details on licensability, Exams, registration, insurance billing and limits on scope of practice. There is great variability, but ACHS MSNUT grads can work in each of these states. What is Credentialing? Credentialing is the term used to verify someone's qualifications for many jobs in healthcare. Credentials may be issued by a U.S. state or a professional organization. Credentialing may include verification of education, training, licensing, an exam, and/or a commitment to a code of ethics. A few of the many professional organizations that issue credentials in CAM professions are listed below: - AHG American Herbalists Guild - AIA Alliance of International Aromatherapists - ARC Aromatherapy Registration Council - ICF International Coaching Federation - IIPA International Iridology Practitioners Association - NAHA National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy - NANP National Association of Nutrition Professionals - NCHEC National Commission for Health Education Credentialing The Holistic Health Professional - Recognizes that achieving good health requires a proper diet, fresh clean water, fresh air, sunlight, exercise, and rest - Teaches her/his clients how to achieve and sustain good health on a daily basis with herbs, essential oils, homeopathics, and other natural modalities to supplement their healthy lifestyles - Understands that each client has a physical, mental, and spiritual self, and that good health requires balance in all areas - Recognizes when allopathic (i.e., conventional medicine) healthcare may be necessary, and is always ready to refer a client to his or her primary care physician for diagnosis and/or treatment - Empowers the client to achieve improved health, both today and for the future, through addressing any imbalances caused by improper nutrition, poor quality sleep, insufficient water, lack of exercise, fresh air, and relaxation - Educates clients to evaluate their lifestyle choices, to isolate and change any potential causes of ill health The Holistic Health Professional Does Not - Diagnose disease. A holistic health practitioner performs evaluations to determine causes of potential health problems, but they do not diagnose disease. Always refer a client back to his or her licensed physician for a diagnosis - Treat disease. A holistic health practitioner focuses on health and education, not on disease, and empowers clients to take charge of their own good health - Prescribe drugs or pharmaceuticals. Holistic health practitioners teach clients about herbs, essential oils, homeopathic remedies, homeobotanical remedies, flower essences, dietary supplements, and nutrition - Perform Invasive Procedures. Depending on his or her training and licensing, a practitioner may use hands-on techniques as part of his or her practice. For example, a practitioner may also be trained as a massage therapist, chiropractor, or osteopath, and use natural health modalities along with that discipline; for example, a massage therapist may use an essential oil blend to complement a massage treatment. Existing healthcare professionals should check with their licensing bodies regarding incorporating their studies into their existing practice. Holistic health practitioners do not perform any invasive procedures, give injections, or draw blood. ACHS programs prepare graduates for exciting holistic health careers in allied health. ACHS alumni become educators, advisors, business owners, writers, and coaches, among many other things.
