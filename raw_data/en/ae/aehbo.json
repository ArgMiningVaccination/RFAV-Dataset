Verywell Family / Kevin Liang From ovulation predictor kits, body thermometers, drinks, books, and more, there are plenty of ways to track and boost your fertility, increase your chances of conception, and reduce some infertility risk factors. The best fertility products are safe to use and work within your time commitments and budget. As always, it's best to speak with a medical professional if you feel you are facing a fertility issue since they can provide personalized guidance. This is especially important if you plan on taking supplements on your fertility journey. Other features to look for in fertility products are ease of use and accuracy. In order to find the best fertility products, we reviewed guidance from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) on infertility, basal body temperatures, and fertility awareness. Moreover, we spoke with Felice Gersh, MD, an OB/GYN, and Casey Seiden, MS, RDN, a registered dietician, about what to look for in fertility products. A board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist on our Review Board also reviewed this article for medical accuracy and integrity, surrounding what to look for in fertility products, when to use them, and their potential dangers. With this guidance in mind, we researched dozens of top-rated fertility products on the market before narrowing down our list to the best 7 options. We carefully considered design, features, ease of use, type of product, accuracy, and overall value when reviewing products.

This set includes 10 ovulation test sticks, so you'll have enough tests to nail down your fertile window. Easy to interpret, the smiley face in the result window displays when your luteinizing hormone (LH) has been detected. This hormone plays a role in the release of eggs and also prepares the uterus for the implantation of a fertilized egg. When the LH surges, this kicks off ovulation, allowing you to identify the two best days to try for a baby. The surge of LH indicates the ovaries have released an egg at a particular time during your cycle, helping to demystify your most fertile window. Great for home use, the sticks just require a urine sample to test for ovulation.

That temperature can actually give you an idea of when you're ovulating as your temperature will drop and then rise before and after an egg is released. This particular thermometer from Easy@Home can connect to an app where all of your temperatures will be tracked and easy to see. Unfortunately, it takes approximately 1.5 to 2 minutes for your reading to pop up. Still, you don't need a timer because the thermometer lets out a gentle beep when finished.

Price at time of publication: $12 The 7 Best Fertility Supplements of 2023, According to a Dietitian How We Selected the Best Fertility Products In order to select the best fertility products, we reviewed guidance from the NIH, CDC, and ACOG on fertility awareness, basal body temperatures, and more. Moreover, we also spoke with Felice Gersh, MD, an OB/GYN, founder/director of the Integrative Medical Group of Irvine, in Irvine, CA, and the author of \"Menopause: 50 Things You Need to Know,\" and Casey Seiden, MS, RDN, CDN, CDCES, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist, to find out what to look for in fertility products. We researched more than 30 products available on the market before narrowing down our list to the seven top-rated fertility products. After selecting our top picks, we carefully considered design, features, ease of use, and overall value when reviewing products. We also researched reviews from customers and competitors and monitored shopping trends to bring you the best and most up-to-date offerings on fertility products. What to Look for When Shopping for Fertility Products Safety First and foremost, you want to ensure that the product you're using is safe\u2014especially when it comes to fertility products that are used internally or supplements. For these types of products, it's important to look over the ingredients list to find out what's actually in them. Lubricants, for example, have been known to contain parabens, which are potentially carcinogenic, according to Dr. Gersh. It's incredibly important to review ingredients in any dietary supplement, especially those taken daily, because if you do become pregnant, you won't find out for around two weeks, which means everything you put into your body will also go to the developing baby. \"For supplements, it's usually best to stay with prenatal nutrients, like vitamins and minerals, and steer clear of herbals while actively trying to conceive,\" Dr. Gersh says. She also recommends looking for products that have been certified by a reputable third party, as \"the supplement would earn the certificate of analysis (COA).\" Time Commitment For anyone who is trying to conceive, waiting is incredibly challenging, and it only becomes more so as the wait continues. When you're working directly with a fertility specialist, they may try to manage your expectations with a six or even 12-month timeline, but the same rule doesn't necessarily apply when it comes to over-the-counter fertility supplements, and that's something to keep in mind when shopping. For instance, when you're trying to track your cycle, you may use several ovulation sticks in your first cycle, and this is a product that is both safe and useful to use month after month. In this case, it might make sense to buy a multi-pack. On the other hand, you may not want to stock up on several months worth of supplements (besides prenatal vitamins). \"If someone truly feels that a specific herbal or some combination [of supplements] may help, then my recommendation would be to...stop [taking] them with the onset signs of a period beginning,\" says Dr. Gersh. Of course, if your personal doctor is recommending these supplements, then you should follow their direction, but if it's a product that you decided to try on your own, it's better to hold off on buying in bulk. Cost Fertility products typically aren't cheap, and if you're using multiple at once, like ovulation sticks, supplements, and lubricants, the cost will quickly add up, especially if you're planning on using them for the foreseeable future. Thus, it's a good idea to keep an eye on the cost of the products and prioritize what is most important and effective. If you're not sure what to prioritize or are struggling with the cost in general, talk to your doctor so they can give you guidance (and possibly even some free samples). Frequently Asked Questions How do fertility products work? The way in which a fertility product works depends entirely on the product. For example, ovulation sticks work by measuring hormone levels in urine, whereas a supplement, like a tea or a pill, may help support your reproductive system, help balance out hormone levels, or just supplement your body with the extra vitamins and minerals it needs in order to be healthy. If nothing else, fertility products can help you get a better understanding of your body and your menstrual cycle to help increase your chances of conception. Do I have to consult a doctor before trying herbal fertility products? You should always consult with your doctor before taking herbal supplements, especially when you're trying to conceive. \"The recommendation is to avoid herbals in pregnancy and in those trying to become pregnant, as herbals have not undergone testing in pregnancy,\" says Dr. Gersh. \"No one never knows if pregnancy has been achieved until around two weeks after fertilization occurs,\" so you never want to be taking a supplement that could potentially harm the baby. Your doctor will be able to offer guidance on what, if any, herbal supplement is safe and useful for you as you try to get pregnant.
