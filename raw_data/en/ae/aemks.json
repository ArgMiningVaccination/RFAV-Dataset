Your doctor knows your health history and can advise you regarding any specific conditions or concerns. - Bring your health insurance card and government-issued identification in case you are required to confirm your identity. - Double check the location and time of your appointment. - If you need a second dose, keep in mind that you may be required to receive the second dose at the same location as the first, either 21 days (Pfizer vaccine) or 28 days after the first dose (Moderna vaccine). If necessary, your doses may be given up to 42 days apart. - At Baylor Scott & White-operated vaccine sites, we are asking all vaccine recipients to complete both doses at the same location.

After getting the COVID-19 vaccine Side effects While mild side effects are to be expected after the COVID-19 vaccine, the likelihood of experiencing a severe side effect is less than 0.5%.
