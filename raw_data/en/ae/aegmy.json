[\u00ab Go Back](javascript:history.go(-1);) Posted: 09/28/22 Central Arkansas Community Flu Clinics This Week Little Rock, Ark.--The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) will offer flu vaccinations at the following community flu clinics in central Arkansas: - September 29 at the Veterans Park Community Center in Cabot from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. - September 30 at the Bishop Park Center in Bryant from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. - October 1 at the Saint Mark Baptist Church in Little Rock from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m Vaccines will be provided at no charge. People should bring their insurance cards to the flu vaccine clinic. If they do not have insurance or if their insurance does not cover flu shots, the vaccine will still be available at no charge. These clinics are a part of ADH's yearly mass flu vaccine clinic effort, which involves vaccine clinics in every county. Information about clinics in other counties can be found [here](https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/influenza). Clinics began this week and continue through the beginning of November. Annual flu vaccination is recommended for most adults and children six months and older. The flu virus changes from year to year and this year's vaccine protects against flu viruses expected to cause the most illness this flu season. People of all ages can get the flu, but certain people are more likely to have serious health problems with it. This includes older adults, young children, pregnant women, people with chronic health conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), people who smoke, and people who live in nursing homes. Therefore, ADH strongly recommends that people in these groups get a flu vaccine. It is also recommended that friends, family members and people who provide care to people in these groups also get a vaccine, not only to protect themselves but also to decrease the possibility that they might expose their loved ones to the flu. The flu vaccine is safe and does not cause the flu. Some people may have mild soreness and redness near the site of the shot and a low fever or slight headache. Reasons to skip the flu vaccine include life-threatening allergic reactions to a previous dose of the flu vaccine or an ingredient in the vaccine. However, people with allergies to vaccine ingredients can often receive the vaccine safely if it is given in a doctor's office where they can be monitored. The flu is easily spread through coughing and sneezing or by touching something with the virus on it, such as a doorknob, and then touching the nose or mouth. Good hand washing habits are important in preventing the flu, but the best way to prevent the flu is to get the vaccine. For more information, go to "}
