Enthusiasts of alternative medicine claim the concrete wall between former West and East Germany can help improve relationships when consumed in a highly diluted form. But the extraordinary treatment, on sale at Ainsworths, the pharmacist by appointment to the Queen and Prince Charles, was highlighted by homeopathy critic Dr Edzard Ernst as an example of far-fetched claims made by alternative medicine. Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University, is a known critic of the controversial practice. He said producers of the product believe it carries the 'spiritual force' from the wall, which divided the German city until it was torn down in 1989 His attack was the latest salvo in the simmering row over the efficacy of these often costly treatments, many of which are available online. The professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University said those behind the Berlin Wall 'treatment' claim it carries a 'spiritual force'. Incredibly, and with no apparent irony, they say it will help 'break down walls' between people, he added. He explained that pieces of the Berlin Wall are ground down and mixed with lactose before being diluted multiple times until they are soluble. The final product does not contain a 'single molecule from the wall', but is claimed to contain its essence, he said. He added: 'The lamentable thing is not that shops sell it, the lamentable thing is that people are being misinformed.' Speaking at the Science Media Centre, Professor Ernst said: 'People think that homeopathy is based on natural substances. Berlin Wall shows this is not true' Another critic of Berlin Wall therapy, writing in the journal Medical Science Monitor wrote: 'What therapeutic advantage does Berlin Wall have over ordinary garden wall, or Spaghetti Junction concrete?' Dr Ernst said the Royal Warrant gives treatments such as the Berlin Wall therapy 'credibility' they do not deserve. Charles is patron of the Faculty of Homeopathy and has lobbied ministers to make more alternative treatments available on the NHS. But he has been accused of promoting disproven and dangerous medical treatments while taking an 'anti-science' position. Other unusual homeopathic remedies available on the market include 'vacuum' and 'sunlight' which involves exposing tablets made of the milk sugar lactose to a vacuum and sunlight. He writes about the treatment in his new book. He added: 'Homeopaths do not believe it is a pharmacological action, but it is a sort of vital force that is acting' Alternative treatments such as chiropractic physical therapy also have their critics. Dr Ernst said that while these kinds of treatment may not directly harm someone taking them, research shows the patient may not seek effective conventional medicine. The British Chiropractic Association said: 'Chiropractic is a registered primary healthcare profession and a safe form of treatment.' Ainsworths, based in central London, sells the Berlin Wall remedy on its website from \u00a34.20 for a 1g vial of lactose tablets, up to \u00a3120 for 1,000ml in liquid potency (23 per cent alcohol).

Every remedy has a large spectrum of activity. 'They are non-toxic, non habit-forming, non-addictive and gentle and curative. It's not like paracetamol is for pain, it doesn't work that way.' Clarence House has previously defended the Prince's support of alternative medicine. A spokesman said: 'The prince believes that safe and effective complementary medicine can play an important role in healthcare systems, as long as approaches are integrated with conventional treatments, a position he has reached after years of talking to experts in many different areas of medicine.' Paul Karason, from the US, was nicknamed 'Papa Smurf' after his skin turned blue after drinking colloidal silver Other 'implausible' remedies Homeopathy Homeopathy is a 'treatment' that uses highly diluted substances which practitioners claim can cause the body to heal itself. It is based on the idea that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove those symptoms. But a report by the Commons science and technology committee said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than dummy treatments and that the principles on which they are based are 'scientifically implausible'. Chiropractic therapy Dr Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University, has warned this therapy is 'the most directly dangerous treatment'. It involves manipulating bones thought to be out of alignment and it is feared the movements could rupture arteries in patients' necks. Acupuncture Mild to moderate side effects occur in one in ten patients, Dr Ernst said. He warned that the needles can give patients infections such as hepatitis, and dangers include the lungs collapsing, having been pierced. Colloidal silver Drinking colloidal silver, a liquid containing silver particles, is claimed to be effective against everything from the common cold to cancer. However, drinking it can cause argyria - a condition which turns the skin blue. Paul Karason, from the US, was nicknamed 'Papa Smurf' after his skin turned blue after drinking colloidal silver. Slapping therapy This treatment involves slapping different parts of the body until the skin starts to look bruised. This is claimed to stimulate energy flow or 'chi' in the body and eliminate toxins. Dr Ernst said: 'There is not a single clinical trial testing whether slapping therapy is effective.' PRINCE CHARLES IS ACCUSED OF BEING ANTI-SCIENCE AFTER TAKING UP ROLE AS PATRON OF THE FACULTY OF HOMEOPATHY Prince Charles was in June accused of promoting disproven and dangerous medical treatments in his new position as patron of the Faculty of Homeopathy. The Prince of Wales is a long-time supporter of homeopathy and has used his royal position to try to get it widely accepted. This is despite some homeopaths operating in the UK claiming to cure autism and offering alternatives to traditional vaccinations. Homeopathy is a branch of medicine that treats ailments using extremely diluted doses of natural substances. It is known as a complementary or alternative approach because it is different from traditional Western medicine. The style of treatment originates from ideas developed in the 1790s, which claim that the more a substance is diluted, the more powerful it is as a treatment. Supporters claim, for example, that traditional inhalers used to treat asthma can be replaced with diluted plant extracts. The Faculty of Homeopathy is the professional body for homeopaths. The prince has faced a backlash for associating with these practitioners and peddling alternative treatments. He has had treatment himself from herbalists and chiropractors for ailments including severe back pain. He also founded the Foundation for Integrated Health in 1993 but the charity closed in 2010 after a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud and money laundering. The Prince of Wales is also Patron to traditional medical establishments.
