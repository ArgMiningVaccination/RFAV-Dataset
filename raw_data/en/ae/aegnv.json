However, the body cannot always use all of the iron because of the difficulty of producing new red blood cells. In such cases, iron overload can occur. Iron also can accumulate in the body when people take in too much iron from Iron therapy given in excessive amounts or for too long Men and postmenopausal women do not usually need to take iron supplements. If they do take supplements, they may have excess iron in the body, although usually not enough to be dangerous. Symptoms of Secondary Iron Overload People with mild iron overload usually have no symptoms. Others typically feel weak and fatigued.

Iron chelation may be given by mouth using deferasirox or deferiprone or by an infusion of deferoxamine, which can be given under the skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein (intravenous). Sometimes deferasirox and deferiprone can be given together. Iron chelation drugs given by mouth are very effective in lowering the iron level in the body. Side effects of oral iron chelation include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rash. The treatment sometimes causes liver and kidney damage, so blood tests are done periodically to monitor the function of these organs. Deferoxamine infusion for iron chelation is usually given overnight. Side effects include digestive upset, low blood pressure, and severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Sometimes people have hearing and vision loss with long-term use. More Information The following English-language resource may be useful.
