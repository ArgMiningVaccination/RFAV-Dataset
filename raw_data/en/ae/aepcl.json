Criteria for Application Review When evaluating a file for interview, the Committee on Admissions emphasizes five major areas holistically without assigning weight to a particular section. Please review the \"Application Requirements\" tab below for more information. The Committee on Admissions reads the entire application prior to rendering a decision; the application is reviewed only once by committee members. Essays - AMCAS and Georgetown Secondary Application Essays Experiences - Clinical Experience, Leadership, Service, and Research. A highly competitive applicant will present a minimum of: - Substantive, longitudinal clinical experiences such as: shadowing a physician, medical mission trips, scribing, community EMS, etc. Please note that volunteering in clinic/waiting rooms such as playing/reading to children, stocking shelves, and transporting patients is considered good volunteer experience, but is not hands-on clinical experience. International experiences are acceptable, but a majority should be in the United States. - Research in any academic discipline. - Direct service to an underserved population MCAT - All applicants MUST have a valid MCAT score. MCAT scores considered \"valid\" are those taken within the two years prior to application. For example, for applicants applying for admission to the entering class of 2024, MCATs from January 2021-September 2023 are valid. No exceptions are made under any circumstances. - Section scores: - <125 are considered non-competitive. GPA - With emphasis on the undergraduate BCPM (Science) GPA: - A highly competitive applicant demonstrates a BCPM (Science) GPA 3.6 - A non-competitive applicant demonstrates a BCPM (Science) GPA 3.0 - Please note: Due to the decision of many institutions to move to an online and/or Pass/Fail format for the COVID-19 crisis from Spring 2020 through Spring 2021, GUSOM will consider Pass/Fail and Credit/No Credit courses, as well as prerequisites completed online, holistically in the context of the full application for those years only. Online and/or Pass/Fail prerequisite coursework taken after Spring 2021 will not be considered. Letters of Recommendation - A minimum of one (1) committee letter/packet (required, if available) or two (2) individual letters is required. There is a maximum of five (5) letters that can be submitted. Please see the \"Application Requirements\" section below for more details. - All recommendation letters should be submitted electronically via AMCAS and assigned to the Georgetown University School of Medicine. The Committee on Admissions takes criminal convictions (felonies/misdemeanors) and institutional actions seriously, especially those involving alcohol, drugs, or plagiarism. Application Prerequisites & Requirements Academic Degree All applicants to the Georgetown University School of Medicine are required to be in possession of a bachelor's degree (or foreign equivalent) from an accredited institution prior to matriculation. Applicants do not need to have obtained the degree prior to application, however: - No applicant will be considered unless the applicant has completed 90 credit hours of course work at the time of application. - Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) courses will fulfill the pre-requisite requirements if the individual courses and credits awarded are detailed on the applicant's college/university transcript. - Courses taken as Pass/Fail can count toward the 90 credit hour requirement. - Only the last 6-8 hours of pre-requisites may be taken in the year prior to matriculation and must be completed by August 1 of the year of matriculation. - Online degree programs and/or online pre-requisite courses will not be considered. This includes \"hybrid\" style courses where a portion is completed online. (See note above regarding Spring 2020 courses affected by the COVID-19 crisis). Pre-Requisite Courses and Course Hours Academic requirements for admissions to the School of Medicine include adequate preparation in physics, biology, chemistry, and mathematics. The following courses are required: - General Biology: 1 year with lab (8 semester hours) - General Chemistry: 1 year with lab (8 semester hours) - Organic Chemistry*: 1 year with lab (8 semester hours). - Physics: 1 year with lab (8 semester hours) - Mathematics (college-level): 1 semester. Calculus is not required; Statistics is acceptable. *Biochemistry (lab not required) is recommended, and may replace a second semester of Organic Chemistry with lab. Courses in microbiology, computer science, cellular physiology, genetics, embryology, biostatistics, quantitative analysis, physical chemistry, humanities, and social and behavioral sciences - while not required - are useful in providing some of the essential skills and knowledge required for a medical education. Substitutions for pre-requisite coursework are not permitted. If the prerequisite coursework was completed 5 years ago or longer, applicants must have been enrolled and completed coursework in a post-baccalaureate program or completed (enrolled) in a graduate program with upper level science coursework within the past 5 years. Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) To be considered for the entering class, scores from the three years prior to the year of matriculation will be considered. (For example, for students who will matriculate in 2024, only MCAT scores from 2021, 2022, and 2023 are valid). No other scores are eligible and - regardless of reason - no exceptions will be made. - If you indicate a future test date on your AMCAS application, no review will be initiated until those scores are received from AMCAS, given that they are taken by September of the application year. - Applicants are encouraged to submit both the Secondary Application and Letters of Recommendation prior to receipt of future MCAT scores. - A valid MCAT score is required for ALL applications. No exceptions will be made to this policy, regardless of circumstances. Letters of Recommendation The Committee on Admissions requires a signed appraisal of your character and ability. Please note that all recommendation letters should be submitted electronically via AMCAS and assigned to the Georgetown University School of Medicine. Of note: - A letter packet from a pre-medical committee is required if available. If your college/university does not offer a committee letter/packet, please submit a minimum of two (2) letters, but no more than five (5) letters. Given that committee packets/letters may contain more than five (5) letters of recommendation, this is the one exception to the five (5) letter maximum. - You may use your discretion when selecting letter-writers, however, it is recommended that you submit a balance of academic, clinical, and service recommendation letters. - Graduate students working toward a degree in the sciences are encouraged to submit a letter from your current graduate faculty. Please see below the instructions for submitting a petition for delayed review if you are in a one-year program below in the \"Procedural Information\" tab. - Only applicants who have been away from degree-granting institutions for greater than three (3) years may elect to submit entirely non-academic recommendation letters.
