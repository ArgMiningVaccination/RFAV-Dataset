In addition to representing our [member organizations](https://www.ivaa.info/about/our-members/), IVAA is a committed part of a larger movement to increase access to complementary medicines and treatments as valuable additions to conventional medicine. We believe that uniting these complementary therapies with conventional therapies into fully integrative medical systems will improve the quality of care and lead to better health outcomes for patients. Delivering on this commitment to pluralism in medical care - that is, taking into account the wide variety of medical approaches that exist - will give patients the resources necessary to help restore their own health. In particular, IVAA cooperates with a number of related associations to work towards meeting the World Health Organization's call for greater integration of anthroposophic and other complementary therapies into healthcare, to work towards better regulation of these treatments and health products, and to encourage more research and investment into understanding the potential benefits and risks of these therapies. A joint document produced by IVAA, the European Committee for Homeopathy (ECH), the European Council of Doctors for Plurality in Medicine (ECPM), and the International Council of Medical Acupuncture and Related Techniques (ICMART) - altogether representing 132 complementary and alternative medical associations - on the health potential of these medical approaches in Europe is [available ](https://usercontent.one/wp/www.ivaa.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CAM_brochure_complete.pdf?media=1680167611) [here](https://usercontent.one/wp/www.ivaa.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CAM_brochure_complete.pdf?media=1680167611) [pdf], and a manifesto calling for its integration into European health systems is [available here](https://usercontent.one/wp/www.ivaa.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MANIFESTO_EUROCAM.pdf?media=1680167611) [pdf].
