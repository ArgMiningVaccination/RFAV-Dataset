While shelters are not expect ed to administer health care services in the traditional sense (such as surgery), triage and surveillance are vital for identifying potentially contagious individuals and othe rs requiring health support. Some shelters may provide limited health care services, which can introduce the risk of infection transmission. In addition, the close proximity of displaced individuals and staff in conjunction with a decrease or lack of routine sanitary services can increase the risk of di sease transmission. Overcrowded living conditions can also contribute to the sp read of communicable diseases as was seen following Hurricane Katrina. To reduce the risk of secondary disease transmi ssion in shelters, shelte r staff must implement appropriate infection prevention a nd control measures. These measures must become part of the emergency preparedness planning and training s cenarios for communities. Whenever possible, standard infection control prac tices should be employed at all types of facilities, even though traditional healthcare services may not be provided at the site . Even during disasters, facilities and communitie s must strive for ideal conditions to further decrease the risk of disease sp read, but that may not be possibl e. In the interim, emergency response procedures must be implemented to prot ect displaced individuals and staff in shelters. During planning, communities should select shelte r equipment that will be easy to clean and disinfect. This document consists of planning recomm endations/guidance that can be used for preparedness and response to potential emergencie s involving infection control issues in shelters. It is designed to be used as a planning and reference document for disaster planners setting up and/or running a shelter. It is hoped that inf ection prevention and control professionals will be involved in community shelters, but resources may not allow this . Therefore, this document was written with the assumption that a non-infection prevention and control professional would be implementing the recommendations. Recommenda tions are divided into sections based on components of an infection prevention and cont rol program. Disaster planners may read through the entire document when planning a shelter or use the Table of Contents to go to a specific section to use as a reference guide during a disaster. Sheltering individuals involves ma ny disciplines, of which infec tion prevention and control is only one. As part of the planning process, commun ity disaster planners sh ould coordinate with local, state, and federal planni ng agencies, including but not lim ited to emergency management, public health, Red Cross, etc. Many planning agen cies are currently deve loping guidelines that address various aspects of setti ng up and running a shelter. These APIC recommendations hope to address the unique infection prevention and cont rol needs of shelters and should be used in conjunction with planning documents for shelters developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Homeland S ecurity, and other local, state, and federal agencies. This multidisciplinary approach must include local medical professionals to ensure proper medical care can be administered duri ng a disaster, including treatment of chronic 5 conditions and assessment of acute illnesses on-site at the shelter or through transfer to a medical facility. Whenever possible, communities should a ttempt to have medical professionals available on-site to assist with triage and provision of medical care. This document does not replace nor should they be used as a substitute for a community disaster plan for shelters. The document should be incorporated into or used as the basis for the community disaster plan section that addresses shelters. The community's Emergency/Disaster Plan must be coordinate d with local, regional, and state plans. A multi- disciplinary approach, including infection contro l professionals, healthcare epidemiologists, public health professionals, facility engineering professionals, and others, should be utilized to apply these recommendations to the response plans. As with all disaster preparedness initiatives, these infection prevention and control interven tions should be tested during routine disaster exercises and drills. Exercising includes developi ng an after action report th at includes strategies to fix gaps identified and timely re-testing of areas of concern. Overview The remainder of this document consists of recommendations designed to reduce the risk of transmitting communicable diseases in sh elters. Although inf ection prevention and control principles are fundamental, this document is not intended for existing shelters used for identified populations (homeless, abused i ndividuals, etc). It should only be used for declared disaster situations during which there are large numbers of displaced individuals who require shelter. This docume nt assumes that individuals ar riving at the shelter have been decontaminated, if necessary by the even t, prior to arrival. Ot her documents address procedures for human decontamination and will not be addressed in this document.1,2,3 Shelters that are set up during disasters are c onsidered temporary and are not expected to administer healthcare services in the traditional sense. However, triage and infection prevention and control strategies ar e critical to identify potentially infectious or acutely ill individuals and prevent the spread of disease with in a shelter. Ill individuals or those requiring specialty care should be transferred to a medical facility or alternate care site as soon as feasible. In situations in which potentially contagious individuals canno t be transferred, shelter staff must implement infection prevention and control in terventions to decrease the risk of disease spread within the shelter. Furthermore, environmental conditions can contribute to communicable disease spread within shelters. Water, food, sanitation, and envir onmental controls are needed to prevent disease emergence and spread. These strategies may need to be in place long-term during large-scale disasters. This document provides recommendations for ha ndling potentially contagious individuals and implementing environmental controls in shelters to prevent or limit the emergence or spread of communicable diseases. Whenever possible, sh elters should implement routine/standard infection prevention and control st rategies used in healthcare sett ings to control the spread of disease. However, during disasters, resources may be limited and normal standards of care may need to be altered. In those s ituations, decreasingly effective in terventions can be implemented, but should only be used when standard prac tices cannot be achieved. This document outlines both standard practices and decrea singly effective interventions. 6 This document serves as the basis for setting up an infection prevention and control program in shelters to prevent the spread of common commun icable diseases. Some diseases or conditions, such as smallpox or viral hemorrhagic fever, require more intensive interventions than the standard procedures described in this document. Furthermore, infection control recommendations can change during a disaster as more is known about the causative agent and/or situation. Community disa ster planners and shelter work ers should partner with local public health agencies before and during a di saster, and follow recommendations from these agencies that are specific to the event. Definition of a Shelter The following is the definition used in this docume nt to describe anticipated activities found in a disaster shelter: A refuge established for the general populat ion for providing prot ection, food, clothing, and minor first aid. Shelters may range from community evacuation centers to basic care facilities, including tented areas, in large-scale events. Shelters may be residential sites, such as dormitories or campsites, or non-resi dential sites, such as churches, schools, or sport stadiums. The shelter may or may not have healthcare professionals on-site to triage individuals or administer care. Planning for Infection Preve ntion and Control in Shelters Communities must plan for disaster scenarios that have infectious disease implications and must involve healthcare and public he alth organizations in the planning for such events. From an infection prevention and control pers pective, there are two distinct types of disasters: infectious disease and non-infectious disease disasters. An infectious diseas e disaster is one in which the event is caused by an infectious agent, such as a bioterrorism atta ck or a pandemic. A non- infectious disease disaster includes all other type s of disasters, such as natural and man-made disasters that do not involve an infectious agen t. Examples of non-infec tious disease disasters include earthquakes, floods, and terrorism events ex cluding bioterrorism to name just a few. The approach to the two types of di sasters should be different in re gards to infection prevention and control recommendations for shelters. During an in fectious disease disaster, all possible steps must be taken to prevent the sh eltering of individuals. Crowde d conditions in a shelter would likely contribute to infection spread in a shelter du ring an infectious diseas e disaster. In the very rare event that individuals must be sheltered during an infectio us disease disaster (such as a hurricane or flood occurring in a community at the same time as a pandemic), community planners should aim to house potentially contag ious/ill displaced individuals in hospitals or alternate care sites that can safely isolate these individuals (see Appendices D & E). This is most important if the causative agent is believed to be spread via the airborne route, such as avian influenza, smallpox, and viral hemorrhagic feve r agents. Disaster planners should consider implementing protective measures fo r airborne isolation within the shelter to prevent the spread of infection while still providing necessary shelter for displaced individuals/families only if all healthcare beds (in both hospitals and alternate care sites) are full and resources allow. These additional infection prevention a nd control measures, namely air borne precautions consisting of 7 negative air flow and the use of high-level respiratory protecti on (see Appendix E), will not be necessary for the vast majority of disasters. Indi viduals infected with ai rborne spread diseases should receive top priority for healthcare beds in any type of a disaster in order to limit disease spread. This document addresses specific infection preven tion and control activities that require planning to provide adequate coverage during an emer gency. These activities s hould be identified and referenced in the community's Emergency/Disa ster Plan. While this document does not offer solutions for all infection control planning need s, it does offer guidan ce for providing the most protective environments possible for displaced individuals and shelter workers. During a disaster, ideal situations, such as adequate s upplies of personal prot ective equipment (PPE), isolation rooms/areas, medical equipment, etc. are not likely to exist. Infection prevention and control measures must be scalable, based on the circumstances of the event. Disasters require innovative approaches to admini stering healthcare serv ices that may or may not meet routine standards of practice. This document is provided in a tiered manner fo r infection control in shelters; they start by describing the most protective measures and worki ng towards the least. The appropriate order in which the steps should be instituted to provide the best protection is delineated. Because disaster response is a dynamic process, community disa ster plans should include procedures for periodically assessing sustai nability and utilization of resources during a disaster. This document will continue to change and be improved as new lessons are learned and new research findings become available. Updating and implementing the key elements of infection prevention and control activities in shelters should continue to be part of the community's preparedness planning efforts. It is important to continue to co mmunicate and update all partners involved in sheltering any tim e that plans are revised. Many types of resources are needed to set up and run a community-based shelter. Appendix A outlines a list of resources/supplies needed to administer infection prevention and control strategies in shelters. Other existing docume nts should be referenced for more general recommendations regarding resour ces needed to run a shelter. 4 Infection Control Coverage Whenever possible, an infection control profe ssional (ICP) should be involved in local and regional emergency preparedness planning and thus available to be consulted as part of the disaster planning process due to the potential fo r infection transmission in shelters. An ICP can assist in developing a needs assessment a nd identifying surv eillance needs, performing surveillance, monitoring infection control prac tices on-site, and interv ening during potential infectious disease outbreaks. If ICP coverage is not feasible, an ICP designee needs to be identified by each shelter and included in th e incident command staff of the site as a medical/technical specialist. This should be done in coordination with local public health communicable disease officials who may be aware of additional local/regional resources to assist. 8 Triage and Surveillance Procedures Syndromic Surveillance The shelter should develop a communicable diseas e assessment plan to m onitor individuals and staff at the site. Formal assessment/triage s hould be conducted on sheltered individuals and shelter staff to identify any potenti al infectious diseases or cond itions. An assessment/triage form example is available in Appendix B. Sheltered individual tria ge/assessment should occur at the following times: Upon arrival/admission to the shelter Daily or depending on risk assessment during non-infectious disease disasters, when resources allow o Periodic screenings (every second or third day, for example) may be substituted during times of limited staff resources/time Daily during infectious disease disasters (i .e., bioterrorism, epidemics, or pandemics) When transferring individuals to a healthcare facility. Formal assessments (see Appendix B) should be conducted by the following individual(s) in descending order by preference: Healthcare professional on-site Designated, trained shelter worker Sheltered individual who voluntee rs or is identified by shelter worker as a leader. Informal/unwritten assessments (i.e., passive surv eillance) can be used in lieu of formal written assessments (such as using Appendix B or anothe r such reporting tool) during disasters that involve extremely limited resources. Informal assessments are not recommended as a substitute for formal assessments during infectious disease disasters (i.e., bioterrori sm, an epidemic, or a pandemic). Shelter staff should be assessed every 24-hours. In addition, staff should be encouraged to self report symptoms between assessments. Sheltered individuals and shelter wo rkers should be encouraged to report symptoms of infectious diseases between screenings. Posters of reporta ble signs and symptoms/s yndromes of potentially infectious diseases should be strategically located around the shelter. A poster example is provided in Appendix C. 5 Community planners should develop and have these posters available as part of their pr eparedness efforts. The results of the formal assessments/triage (i.e ., active surveillance) and passive surveillance (self-reported symptoms between screenings) should be reviewed by the ICP/ICP designee on- site and reported to the Incident Commander or Director of the sh elter if deemed necessary. The ICP/ICP designee should also repo rt the results to the local an d state health department as required in the Emergency/Disast er Plan for the community. 9 Increases in rates of illness identified through syndromic surveillance should be investigated by the ICP/ICP designee on-site and the local health department. In addition, plans should include \"trigger points\" in which shelter operations and/or changes in staffing must be considered prior to hitting a critical nature. Increasing respiratory infec tion rates should be handled by monitoring for compliance with respiratory etiquette (i ncluding hand hygiene) and invest igating potentia l sources of infection. Immunization Shelter workers should be assessed for curre nt immunization status (see Appendix B: Syndromic Surveillance Assessment/ Triage Fo rm) upon admittance to the shelter or on their first day of work and encouraged to receive any disaster-specific vaccines, such as Tetanus or Influenza, offered by the health department or designee. Whenever possible, shelter workers should be brought up to date according to the adult immunization schedule as outlined by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Pract ices or in accordance with public health recommendations on all immunizations be fore starting work in the shelter. Sheltered individuals should be en couraged to receive any disast er-specific vaccines, such as Tetanus or Influenza, offered by the health de partment. Immunization administration may occur at the shelter or at a nearby s ite. If the shelter a ssists in immunization distribution, vaccine administration should be documented and prope r follow-up of vaccinated individuals should occur in collaboration with lo cal public health officials. Issues of immunization manageme nt during a disaster must incl ude the Immunizations Programs at the local and state leve l. Many states have statewide registri es that can facilitate accurate and complete documentation mechanisms specific to immunizations. This will be important during post event follow-up, if necessary. Post Discharge Surveillance During an outbreak or a pandemic, shelter sta ff should work in coordination with local public health agencies to set up post-discharge surveillan ce for individuals who return to their homes or the community. Post discharge surveillance should be included in community disaster plans, including identifying ag encies (public health, home health, etc) that will coordinate this process. Infection Control Triage Using sound observational techniques and data from the syndromic surveillance process, individuals should be triaged based on th eir risk of being contagious. Certain symptoms/syndromes may indicate that an in dividual has a communicable disease. These syndromes and corresponding appropriate infection control interventions fo r these syndromes are outlined in Appendix D. 10 Transfer to a Healthcare Facility The on-site ICP or ICP designee should communicat e the infected individual's disease status and the need for precautions to the facility lead or incident command. They maintain responsibility to stay in contact with the receivi ng facility in relation to the pa tient's diagnosis for follow-up. The shelter must have a coordinated process that fa cilitates communication between the shelter and receiving facility in the even t a change in the patient's condition has infection transmission implications for the shelter. Isolation Precautions Isolation Precautions are divided into categories based on how diseases are transmitted. For more information on disease transmission, refer to the CDC/HICPAC Guideline for isolation precautions.6 Appendix E provides a quick reference on isolation categories and interventions that should be implemented in shelters. A ppendix F provides a poster explaining Respiratory Etiquette that can be posted with in shelters to help educate sheltered individuals and shelter staff.7 Isolation Area The shelter should have a designated isolation area for potentially infectious individuals. The following guidelines should be used when developi ng and operating an isolation area within a shelter: Choose an area that is physica lly separated from the rest of the shelter by walls on all sides and a door o A building or area outside or near the act ual shelter can be used and may be the best choice for isolation area placement. This could include mobile medical assets/facilities in development as part of state level Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) planning. Community shelter planners must remain involved in local, regional, and state HPP. If such an area does not exist a nd cannot be made inside the sh elter, an isolation area can be created using plastic or other barrier material. o Makeshift walls that are floor to ce iling (if feasible) should be created o Isolation signs or posters should be placed near the entrance to the isolation area to indicate that individuals should not en ter the area without appropriate personal protective equipment In certain situations, such as sheltered indi viduals infected with respiratory droplet or airborne spread diseases, additional precauti ons may need to be taken to ensure the isolation area has controlled air movement. o See Appendix E for information on air ha ndling and ventilation recommendations for isolation areas. Limit crossover of shelter staff between the isolation unit and the rest of the shelter occupants. 11 o Assign dedicated shelter staff (e.g., h ealthcare workers when available, housekeeping, custodial) to provide care fo r potentially infecti ous individuals and restrict these staff from working with non-infectious individuals in the shelter (Cohorting) o Dedicate an entrance(s) or passageway( s) for infectious individuals when feasible8. This promotes separation as well as the ability to triage those who have been working with potentially infectious patients. Placement of Individuals Individual placement within the shelter should be determined by review of the Syndromic Surveillance Assessment/ Triage Form (Appendix B) and the Infection Control Triage results (Appendix D). Whenever possible, families (especi ally those with small children) should be placed together within the shelter. Symptomatic individuals should be cohorted based on their isolation precaution cat egory (See Appendix E). Arrange all sleeping area s (including cots) so that indi viduals are separated by putting a minimum of 3 feet between individual sleeping areas (or cots) to prevent the spread of infections. In addition, sheltered individuals should be instructed to sleep head to toe (See Appendix G). Hand Hygiene The most important measure for preventing the sp read of pathogens is effective hand hygiene. Appropriate hand hygiene should be practiced in all shelters. Hand hygiene is defined as any method that removes or destroys microorganism s on the hands. Frequent handwashing using soap and water removes potentially infectious material from the skin and helps prevent transmission of diseases. Al cohol Based Hand Rubs (ABHR), which include a variety of waterless alcohol-based hand hygi ene products such as gels, fo ams, and liquids and are the preferred method for hand hygiene when hands are not visibly soiled. In general, hand hygiene is required whenever significant hand contamination is possible and the spread of pathogens through cro ss-contamination may occur. Th is includes activities involving contact with mucous membranes, blood or body fluids, secretions , or excretions. Also, hand hygiene is recommended after touching inanimate s ources, which are likely to be contaminated with virulent or epidemiological important microorganisms. Hand hygiene is crucial following contact with a symptomatic indi vidual. Instructions for performing hand hygiene are included in Appendix H. A process should exist to assess the shelter to determine if adequate hand hygiene capabilities exist and if not, respond to that assessment. Most routine contact with indi viduals in the shelter does not require hand hygiene. Hand hygiene is required with the following activities: Before and after eating, drinking and touching the face or mouth Before and after preparing food After using the toilet After contact with respiratory secretions and facial tissues 12 Before and after contact with wounds After handling soiled clothes and bed/cot linens After cleaning up vomitius, fecal accid ents, or other body fluid spills After cleaning and disinfecting environmental surfaces After removing gloves After removing a face shield/eye protection Before and after removing respirator or mask Before entering and when leaving the common play area (see Toys section) After visiting or handling an animal in th e pet shelter (see Pet Management section) After handling pet food (see Food Safety section) After activities in which the hands become visibly soiled After playing with shared toys. Hand hygiene facilities (sinks and/or Alc ohol Based Hand Rubs) should be conveniently located throughout the facility. Hand hygi ene stations should be located: In or just outside every isolation room/area o More than one station may be necessary if a large room is used for isolating several symptomatic individuals Near the restrooms Near the food prepara tion and/or kitchen area Near the eating area As needed throughout the shelter. During infectious disease outbreaks and/or when ever resources allow, hand hygiene compliance should be monitored. Shelter staff should be locat ed inside or near the hand hygiene stations and/or restrooms to monitor hand hygiene technique. Monitoring hand hygiene compliance has been shown to increase effec tiveness of the procedure and decrease disease transmission. Hand Hygiene Technique Instructions for performing hand hygi ene are included in Appendix H. Hand Hygiene Signage Hand Hygiene notices/signs should be posted at all shelter entrances, washrooms and hand hygiene stations. See Appendix I for samples of appropriate signage for handwashing and use of alcohol-based hand hygiene products. Hand hygiene si gnage should be used as a supplement to, rather than a substitute for, monitoring hand hygiene compliance. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Personal protective equipment is gear designe d to protect the wearer from exposure to microorganisms. Examples of PPE include gl oves, gowns, goggles, face shields, masks, and 13 respirators. Choose PPE based on the pro cedure you are performing and the mode of transmission of potential ag ents (see Appendices D & E).6 For example, if you are performing tasks in which you expect hand exposure to any body fluid\u2014when cleaning a sheltered individual's wound for example \u2014you should wear gloves. If you expect splashing or spraying, such as when you empty a urine collection ba g, you should wear a gown, gloves, and protective eyewear.6 Different diseases require different types of PPE based on how the agent is transmitted. 6 This can range from using gloves only to wearing full PPE. For most encounters with sheltered individuals, when the potential fo r splashing of blood or body fluids is not present, routine use of gloves and hand hygiene will be sufficient to prot ect you from infection. For some individuals and some procedures, you'll need to wear a dditional PPE. Appendix D outlines syndromes for which additional precautions are needed. Appendi x E outlines the appropriate PPE for each of the isolation categories. Gloves Gloves are the most commonly used type of PPE. In shelters, non-sterile gloves should be worn when handling sheltered individu als' clothing or item s or when contact with a sheltered individual's blood or bod y fluids, non-intact skin, or muc ous membranes is anticipated. If resources allow, a new pair of gloves should be used for each encounter with a symptomatic individual. Recommendations for glove use:6 Use a new pair of gloves when contact with blood or body fluids, non-intact skin, or mucous membranes is anticipated Change gloves when they are heavily soiled with blood or other potentially infectious material, or if they are torn Change your gloves to prevent cross-contam ination of body sites. For example, if you clean an individual's wound, you should change your gloves before t ouching another part of the individual or performing other tasks. Always work from clean areas to dirty or heavily contaminated areas of the body. For example, blood pressure should be taken before cleaning a wound. Do not touch your body or surfaces in the she lter environment with contaminated gloves Always change gloves after providing care to each of the sheltered individuals and perform hand hygiene immediatel y after removing your gloves Although gloves keep most microorganisms fr om getting on your hands, they are not completely protective. Always perform ha nd hygiene before and after removing gloves. There are currently no recommendations regarding the reuse of gloves.6 Gowns An isolation/procedure gown should be used wh en splashing or spraying of clothes or the body with blood or body fluids is anticipated.6 14 Recommendations for gown use:6 Wear an isolation/procedure gown to prot ect your clothing, arms , and other body areas when splashing or spraying of clothes or the body with blood or body fluids is anticipated The isolation/procedure gown should cover your torso area, fit loosely over your body, and have long sleeves that fit snuggly at the wrist The opening of the gown shoul d always be in the back Tie or fasten the gown in th e back to keep it in place Remove the gown when you are finished providi ng care or treatment to an individual Take the gown off either in the doorway or in the area immediately outside the isolation or triage area in the shelter, de pending on where you are during gown use Avoid touching the outside of the gown during use and removal because it is contaminated. If resources allow, a new gown should be us ed for each encounter with a symptomatic individual. As resources dwindle, gowns may be reused by the same shelter worker for the same symptomatic individual or gr oup of individuals as long as the gown integrity is not compromised. If gowns are reused, consideratio n should be given to storage or placement between uses to maximize its use as well as to prevent inadve rtent contamination. Masks and Respirators It is important to choose the correct respirator y protection to prevent becoming exposed to an airborne or droplet spread di sease. The following discussion and recommendations for use of respiratory protection presumes that adminstrative and environmental controls addressing potential airborne infectious agents i.e, patien t placement, cohorting etc. as described above have been implemented to the extent possible. Respirators are not the same as surgical masks. Surgical or procedure masks are the type of respiratory protection worn most often in healthca re settings. They are loose-fitting and allow air particles to leak in around the edge of the mask. 9 Surgical or procedure masks are designed to help keep potentially infectious droplets from being spread by the pers on wearing them, and to keep sprays from coughs and sneezes from r eaching the mouth and nose of the wearer. In contrast, respirators (usually an N95 or higher level respirator) are designe d to protect a person from breathing in very small particles, which might contain viruses or bact eria. They fit tightly against the face so that most of the air inhaled goes through the filtering material.9 Community disaster plans should include processes for periodically assessing sustainability and utilization of resources during a disaster, incl uding the use of surgic al/procedure masks and respirators for shelter staff and sheltered indivi duals. Surgical/procedure mask and respirator selection depends on the likely route of transmi ssion as noted in the isolation category for an infected individual (see Appendix E). When resources allow, a new disposable surgical/procedure mask or respirator should be worn for each encounter with an infected individual or entrance into the isolation area within the shelter. Reusable respiratory protection may be used by shelter workers in lieu of dis posable surgical/procedure masks or respirators, using the following recommendations8: 15 If re-useable elastomeric respirators are use d, these respirators must be decontaminated according to the manufacturer's instructions after each use Powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) may be considered for shelter workers stationed in the isolation area. o PAPRs have the advantages of providi ng eye protection, being comfortable to wear, and not requiring fit-testing; howe ver, hearing (e.g., for auscultation) may be impaired, limiting their utility for clinical care o PAPRs must be decontaminated between uses; see manufacturer's recommendations for instructions o Training is required to ensure proper use and care of PAPRs. o Power sources within the shelter must be identified for recharging PAPRs between uses. Regardless of respirator or surgical/procedure mask resource levels, the following guidelines should be used when determining respirator/mask usage: Workers should receive training on how to put on, use, and take off the respirator or surgical/procedure mask, including how to: o Put on and use the respirator or surgical/procedure mask \u0083 Perform hand hygiene prior to putt ing on the respirator or mask \u0083 Avoid contamination during use by not touching the outside of the respirator or mask \u0083 Use a face shield that can be worn over a respirator or mask to protect it from contamination with blood or other body fluids The face shield should be removed so as to prevent respirator/mask contamination Decontaminate the face shield between uses Perform hand hygiene after removal of the face shield and before removing the respirator or mask o Check the seal of the respirator for adequacy of fit \u0083 Seal checks processes are outlined by the manufacturer o Remove and dispose of the respirator or surgical/procedure mask (See Appendix J) \u0083 Respirator or surgical/procedure mask should be discarded after use (i.e., after worn in the presence of an infected individual) \u0083 Discard respirator or surgical/pro cedure mask sooner if it becomes obviously soiled or damaged (e.g., creased or torn) \u0083 Perform hand hygiene after removing th e respirator or surgical/procedure mask. 16 Shortage of Respirators In the event of an actual shortage of N-95 or higher level respirators 10: First priority should be given to shelter or healthcare worker s performing aerosol- generating procedures (i.e., intubations, nebul izer treatments to asthmatic children, or suctioning for people with chronic respiratory conditions) Second priority should be gi ven to shelter or healthcare workers providing direct care involving close contact (within 3 feet) of coughing individuals and cohorted areas. Reuse the respirator as long as possible o The respirator must be discarded if it becomes obviously soiled or damaged (e.g., creased or torn) o The respirator must be discarded if the wearer has difficulty breathing Workers assigned to the isola tion or cohorting area should be instructed to keep the respirator on while in the isolation area, a nd avoid removing or manipulating the device If supplies of N-95 or higher level respir ators become unavailable, an FDA-approved healthcare surgical/proce dure mask may be used o Choose a tight-fitting surg ical/procedure mask \u0083 Use a surgical/procedure mask that ca n be tied tightly or have elastic straps \u0083 Ear loop masks do not form a seal and are therefore less preferred than tight-fitting masks o Surgical/procedure masks do not offer appr opriate respiratory protection against small infectious particle aerosols (i.e., dr oplet nuclei) and should only be used if respirators are not available. Shortage of Surgical/Procedure Masks In the event of actual shortage of FDA- approved healthcare surg ical/procedure masks10: First priority should be given to shelter or healthcare worker s performing aerosol- generating procedures (i.e., intubations, nebul izer treatments to asthmatic children, or suctioning for people with chronic re spiratory conditions) and cohorted areas10: Reuse the FDA approved healthcare surgic al/procedure mask as long as possible o The mask must be discarded if it becomes wet or dirty with secretions, obviously soiled, or damaged (e.g., creased or torn) o The mask must be discarded if th e wearer has difficulty breathing Workers assigned to the isolati on area should be instructed to keep the surgical/procedure mask on while in the isolation area, no t removing or manipulating the device If supplies of FDA-approved healthcare su rgical/procedure masks become absolutely unavailable there should be recognition that: 17 o Controversies exist regarding how to pr oceed when supplies of N-95 or higher level respirators and FDA-approved health care surgical/procedure masks or even FDA-approved respirators for public hea lth emergencies, intended for general public use are depleted/unava ilable. This is why these issues should be clearly reviewed, discussed, and planned fo r prior to setting up a shelter. o Review of the scientific literature iden tified one published letter that details construction of a handmade, reusable cott on mask. This type of mask may provide some level of protection, based on anecdotal and/or limited evidence.9,11-13 No recommendation can be made but decisi on makers should be aware of such potential resources. o No evidence about the effectiveness of non-FDA-approved masks (fabric masks or masks intended to filter dust and mist from wood, metal, and masonry work) in preventing infectious disease spread has been found in the literature to date. As such, no recommendation for their use can be made.10 Because this is an area of ongoing research, sh elter planners must remain vigilant about assessing the scientific literature for current fi ndings and share with all disciplines involved in setting up and staffing local, re gional, and state shelters. Sexually Transmitted Diseases Sexually transmitted diseases could possibly be sp read within the shelter. Consideration should be given to provide various type s of barrier protection to indivi duals in the shelter, such as condoms. In addition, shelter employees should coor dination with local pub lic health agencies for follow-up or contact tracing when needed. Water Management Shelters may experience a larg e need for water during disaster response. In addition, some disasters, especially a natural disaster such as a flood or hurricane, may result in compromised municipal water supply. Microbial contamination of water poses an extensive health risk; safe water reserves must be identified and available to shelters. Back-up supplies of potable water for human consumption, sanitation, and hygiene will be essential for shelters during a disaster. Water Usage Depending on the conditions of the shelter, the water allocation and utilization will vary. Guidelines for supplies of water needed for disasters and shelters have been published by responding agencies and is not an infection control issue.14 Only infection control issues specific to water management are covered in this document. Water Collection and Storage If community disaster planners store water for use in shelters during a disaster, care should be taken to keep the water free from microbes and safe for consumption. 18 When storing water using old/used containers (cans, jars, bottles, glasses) as receptacles for water, the following recommendations should be followed15: Clean the container surface with soap and water then rinse before use Clean the inside of container with a bleach solution o Bleach solution: Add 1 teaspoon unscente d household chlorine bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) with 1 cup water Cover container and agitate, allowing solutio n to contact all inside container surfaces. Cover and allow to sit for 30 mi nutes. Rinse with potable water Label container as \"DRINKI NG WATER\" and mark the date prepared on the label Store at ambient temperature, away from h eat, direct sunlight and away from toxic substances, such as gasoline or pesticides Change containers every 6 months, if necessary. If bottled or running water is not available and al ternate sources of water are used (melted ice, canned fruit or vegetable juice, etc), care should be taken to pr event microbial contamination: Use melted ice that originated from a comme rcial source (ice machines or a freezer) o Melted ice from outdoor sources, such as icicles, should not be used for consumption Use canned fruit or vegetable juice or juice from other canned products Water from a toilet tank (not the bowl) may be used if additional chemicals, such as bluing has not been added16 Swimming pool or spa water can be utili zed for hygienic purposes, but not for consumption. Water Decontamination Non-potable water must be decontaminated be fore use. There are two basic methods for decontaminating water: boiling and chemical trea tment. Boiling water is the preferred method for water decontamination. The processes for dec ontaminating water are outlined in Appendix K. Water from Local Reservoirs, Lakes, and Rivers Water from local streams or la kes should be considered contam inated and water from these sources should be decontaminated before c onsumed. Let the water stand before beginning treatment to allow suspended particles to settle to the bottom. Remove suspended particles using a straining device, such as a co ffee filter or layers of clean cloth. Prior to using a straining device, a decanter can also be used to separate settled particles from the water. After suspended particles are removed, follow procedures for water decontamination. Well Water If the shelter will rely on well water during a disaster , especially after a natural disaster such as a flood or hurricane, special precautions must be taken to ensure that the water is safe for consumption. The well water should be tested before used for consumption. Testing and 19 decontamination of well water requires at least 48 - 72 hours, so other water sources (see Water Decontamination section) shoul d be used in the interim.17 If the water has a chemical or fuel odor, it should not be used until the contamination in the well has been removed Remove floating debris from water using a grappling hook, net or long-handled scoop If sand or silt are present, remove the well pump and clean it before use Scrub the sides of the well using a chlori ne solution [1 teaspoon unscented household chlorine bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) with 1 cup wate r] then rinse with clean water. Empty polluted water from well by pumping or bailing until the water is clear Decontaminate the well water using a chlo rine solution [See Appendix L.] Pour the chlorine solution down the well in a circular pattern, ensuring contact with all sides of the well. If possible, place a garden hose that is connect ed to an outside faucet into the well and run the water for 15 minutes to mix the chlorine solution properly. For wells connected to a plumbing system: o Open all faucets and pump water until you notice a strong odor of chlorine at each faucet. When chlorine is smelled at each faucet, stop the pump and allow the chlorine solution to sit in the well and plumbing system for the proper time. [See Appendix L.] If no chlorine is smelled af ter 15 minutes, increase the amount of chlorine used the first time and repeat the procedures. o After the chlorine solution has sat in th e well for the recommended period, turn on the pump, attach a hose to an outside fau cet, and direct the water to a designated area away from the well, water tanks, and streams. Run the water until the chlorine smell disappears. For wells with no plumbing system: o Pump or remove water in buckets until the chlorine odor disappears. Well water from a disinfected well should be tested before consumption. Wait at least 48 hours after well disinfection to test the wate r. Water testing for coliform and either E. coli or fecal coliform bacteria should be pe rformed in conjunction with local health officials. Retest the well water 2 - 4 weeks after disinfection. Food Safety Food needs to be made available to individuals and their families during emergencies, but can pose an infectious disease risk if not stored, prep ared, and handled appropriately. Shelter planners should involve registered dieticians and/or licen sed sanitarians when developing formal written plans for obtaining, storing, rota ting and dispensing food supplies. Dieticians and sanitarians services should be coordinated and made availabl e through local and state public health agencies and/or community emergency management. Only inf ection control issues sp ecific to food safety are covered in this document. 20 Safe Handling of Human Food The following are recommendations for safe fo od storage, preparation, and handling of human food18: Store in a dark, dry, cool site well sealed to th e outside to prevent pest and vermin attraction o Store human and pet food separately19 Store off the floor by a minimum of 4 inches Symptomatic shelter workers sh ould not prepare or serve food (see Syndromic Surveillance section) Refrigerate perishable food when possible o Monitor refrigerator/freezer temperature to ensure proper storage (refrigerator: 38 - 400 F; Freezer: 00 F) o Plan for temperature degradation Prepared hot food mu st be kept at 1400 F Prepared cold food should be kept at 450 F Leftovers should be used w ithin 4 days or discarded20 Discard any food that requires refrigeration th at has been kept at room temperature for 2 hours20 o Discard any food that has been kept 1 hour in a room above 900 F20. Proper disinfection of work surfaces and utensils should be performed pr ior to and after food preparation (see Environmental Decontamination section). Safe Handling of Pet Food The following are recommendations for safe food st orage, preparation, and handling of pet food: Pet food should be stored similarly to human food 19 Store human and pet food separately19 Leftover wet pet food should be refr igerated promptly or discarded19 Pet food bowls, dishes and scooping utensils shou ld be washed with soap and hot water after each use19 Do not use the pet food bowl to scoop out food; use a clean, dedicated scoop or spoon19 Perform hand hygiene after handling pet food19 Waste Management Regular Trash Adequate trash receptacles should be available and emptied regularly to ensure they do not become overfilled. Ensure regulated medical wast e (i.e., biomedical wa ste/body fluids and/or used needles and sharps) is not mingled with regular trash. The holding area for disposal of waste materials should be safe, clean, and free of access by vermin and insects. After trash is picked-up for disposal, the holding area shoul d be cleaned and disinfected to remove accumulated organic material; this will preven t activity by insects, animals, and vermin. 21 Regulated Medical Waste Shelters should prepare for the presence of re gulated medical waste (RMW). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's definition of RMW is as follows: Liquid or semi-liquid blood or ot her potentially infectious ma terials; contaminated items that would release blood or other potentially infectious materials in a liquid or semi- liquid state if compressed; items that are ca ked with dried blood or other potentially infectious materials and are capable of re leasing these materials during handling; contaminated sharps; and pathological and mi crobiological wastes containing blood or other potentially infectious materials.21 Most barrier equipment (gowns, gloves, respirator s/masks) and dressings will not be considered RMW unless dripping or caked with blood. RMW shoul d be placed in red bags or containers if available, or the bag/container should be labe led as Regulated Medical Waste (RMW) according to state regulations. A biohazard sticke r/label can be used if available. Appendix M provides a table of prop er disposal for various types of waste, including RMW. All shelters should follow any federal, state, and lo cal requirements regardin g the disposal of RMW. In the case of conflicting requirements, the mo re stringent regulation should be followed. Community disaster plans should include provisions for RMW dis posal for shelters. Many local jurisdictions have standing arra ngements for appropriate trash management during disasters, including handling medical waste. A multidisciplin ary approach should be taken to ensure that shelter planners coordinate with local emergenc y management and public health agencies. In the event that a community disaster plan does not have such prov isions, the following emergency disposal/treatment alternatives should be considered: RMW should remain at the shelter o Store RMW in an enclosed area (a dirt y utility room/area) until arrangements for pick-up can be made. Sharps may be placed in a rigid plastic cont ainer such as a two liter soda bottle and adding a simple bleach solution to render them non-infectious before disposal as regular solid waste (following consultation with state and local regulators). Environmental Decontamination The environment can contribute to infectious di sease spread because germs can be spread via hands and equipment when items in the environment become contaminated. Items that are touched most frequently, such as tables, doorknobs , utensils, toys, etc., pose the most risk to disease transmission. The more contaminated th e environment, the greater probability that disease transmission to clients a nd staff may occur. The large nu mber of individuals sheltered together in close quarters will increase the num ber of germs in the environment. This is especially true during a pandemic or outbreak of an infectious di sease when infected individuals 22 shed infectious particles that contaminate the environment and pose a ri sk to other sheltered individuals and shelter workers. There is also the potential for sheltered indi viduals to bring mold into the shelter via contaminated objects or for mold to grow within the shelter if it becomes wet. Shelter workers should monitor for potential environmental contamina tion of the shelter from internal or external sources. The shelter should be evaluated for potential so urces of mold; the risk of mold is highest after a flood or hurricane 22 Proper cleaning and disinfection of the environm ent (i.e., the shelter and areas/items in the shelter) are essential to decrease the risk of disease transmission. Shelter workers should receive clear guidance and training regarding the principl es of cleaning and disinfection. A summary of the cleaning activities for each shelter area should be developed and provided to the person assigned to clean that partic ular area. Guidelines on prope r cleaning and disinfection are available through existing documents. 23 Shelter areas may be divided into the following areas (this is not an all inclusive list): Kitchen Dining Bathroom Dormitory/sleeping area Common play area Medical/First aid area Isolation. Shelter workers should be provide d appropriate PPE. Workers must be trained regarding PPE use and disposal to decrease skin exposure to ha rsh chemicals during cl eaning and disinfection activities. Pre-mixed solutions or pre-moistene d towelettes/wipes may decrease exposure risk. Selection of Cleaning/Disinfection Agents The disinfection agent used to clean shelters should be an EPA-registered chemical disinfectant.11 EPA-registered disinfectants should be used in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations in regards to dilution and contact time.23 In most cases, an EPA-registered quate rnary ammonium compound is adequate for cleaning environmental surfaces24 Disinfectant products can be purchased undiluted, diluted in spray bottles, or pre-moistened towelettes. The form of the di sinfectant product is less important than the dilution and contact time when the product is used. Manufacturer's recommendations should always be followed to ensure proper disinfection of the environment.23,25 If an EPA-registered disinfectan t product is unavailable, a bl each solution can be created by mixing 1 teaspoon unscented household chlorine bl each (sodium hypochlorite) per quart of clean water [metric conversion: 5 ml bleach per lite r of clean water]. EPA-registered chemical 23 germicides are preferred over bleach solutions be cause they are less corrosive to environmental surfaces and there are less offensive fumes associated with their use. If EPA-registered disinfectant and/or bleach solution supplies st art to dwindle, commercially available cleaners may be substituted. Efforts should be made to prevent solutions us ed for cleaning and disinfection from becoming cross contaminated. Disinfectant/ cleaning solution in buckets or one-time use containers should be discarded after each use. Thoroughly rinse and clean housekeeping equipment after use and allow the equipment to dry properly. Cleaning Body Fluid Spills All body fluid spills should be cleaned up immedi ately. If a spill contains large amounts of blood or body fluids, the following procedure should be followed 21: Put on gloves Cover the spill with an absorbent material Apply an EPA-registered disinfectant (all ow it to sit for the time required by the manufacturer's recommendations) Cover the spill with additional absorbent material Dispose of all materials in appropria te waste container (see Appendix M) Clean the area with cloth or paper towels m oderately wetted with an EPA-registered disinfectant Allow surfaces to air dry. Cleaning Environmental Surfaces Cleaning frequency should occur as follows: Bathroom areas should be cleaned daily and as necessary Food preparation areas should be cleaned af ter each meal and as needed between food preparation tasks Dining areas should be cleaned after each meal Living and sleeping areas should be cleaned at least weekly and more often if necessary Traffic flow patterns and use will determine the frequency these areas should be cleaned Cots and assorted bedding should be clean ed and laundered between occupants and as needed when contaminated with body fluids o Other furniture should be cleaned weekly and as needed Medical/First aid or triage areas shou ld be cleaned daily and as necessary o Frequency and level of cleaning and di sinfection will be determined by the healthcare services being provided Isolation area should be clean ed daily, upon individual transfer to a medical facility or move to another part of the shelter, and as necessary. Environmental surfaces frequently touched by hands should be disinfected/cleaned following the cleaning frequencies listed above . If possible, use a vacuum cleaner equipped with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter for cl eaning carpeted floors, upholstered furniture, or 24 other cloth items. Disinfection of the vacuum cleaner is not re quired when a HEPA filter is properly installed and remains in tact during use. Commercially available products may be used to remove visible soil or stai ns from carpets and upholstery. Cleaning Cots/Mattresses When possible, cots or mattresses should be co vered with an impermeable barrier (waterproof mat/sheet, absorbent pad, blue pad, plastic, etc) to prevent them from becoming contaminated. If impermeable barrier resources are limited, barri ers should be prioritized to incontinent individuals or those with a draining wound. If impermeable barriers are not used and cots/mattresses become contaminated, they should be cleaned/disinfected. Disinfection procedures depend on the cot/mattress material: Plastic materials should be disinfected using the procedure for cleaning body fluid spills Cloth/canvas materials should be cleane d by scrubbing with soap and water or disinfectant o Grossly contaminated cots/mattresses ma y need to be discarded, if resources allow [See Appendix M]. Toys In shelters, toys will be presen t, shared, and exchanged. While toys are an important tool for distraction, entertainment, and development, they have the potential to spread disease.1 Shelters should have a designated play area for childre n. Children and parents/gua rdians should perform hand hygiene before entering and when leaving the common play area.26 The following recommendations will reduce the risk of disease transmission related to toys in shelters. Toy Selection If toys will be provided by a shelter for use by child ren, the shelter should have a written plan for toy storage, monitoring and cleaning and shelter sta ff will need to be trained on these procedures. Preference should be given to toys with non- porous surfaces that are less likely to become contaminated and can be eas ily cleaned, disinfected and dried.6,26 Avoid crib mobiles, soft/stuffed toys, hand- held electronic games, and wooden and blow toys because they are difficu lt to clean, disinfect and dry.27 Avoid bath or other toys that retain water because they can harbor germs.6 Soft/stuffed animals and cloth dolls donated to the shelter should only be accepted if they are new or have been cleaned a nd disinfected prior to delivery.26 Handling and Cleaning Communal Toys The ability to maintain communal toys safely in a shelter demands that staff are assigned to monitor the common play area and toys, and im plement cleaning and disinfection protocols. Toys that are able to be clean ed and disinfected between uses may be shared/exchanged between 25 children in the shelter (i.e., co mmunity toys) if cleaned betwee n each use. Soft/stuffed animals and cloth dolls should not be shared/exchanged between children in the shelter.27 The sharing of hand-held electronic games and woode n toys should be discouraged as they are difficult to clean. Communal/shared toys should be handled using the fo llowing recommendations: Two toy boxes should be made and labeled appr opriately: One box for clean toys and one for dirty toys that need to be cleaned o If toy boxes are not available, a clean a nd dirty area for toys should be designated within the shelter to segregate clean from dirty toys After use, toys should be placed in the dirty toy box or segregated area All toys in the dirty toy box or dirty toy area should be cleaned before next use All toys should be examined by a shelter worker after each use o If toy is broken or unable to be cleaned, it should be discarded Routine cleaning of books, crayons and board games is impractical. Any of these items that become visibly soiled should be discarded and any ch ild found having contact with the item via mouth should be given the item. The book/crayons/game should not be shared Magazines and other dated reading materials should be replaced at least monthly with new materials, or wh en visibly soiled Language appropriate information sheets de aling with basic hygiene surrounding children and toys, should be developed in advance a nd provided at the time of admission to the shelter. See Appendix N for an example of an educational poster about toys. Frequency of Toy Cleaning and Disinfection 27 Communal toys (e.g., wall-mounted and table-mo unted toys, computer keyboards, mouse and monitors) should be cleaned at least daily and when obviously soiled28 Toys of diapered children should be cl eaned daily or when visibly soiled Toys of nondiapered children should be cleaned weekly or when visibly soiled Toys that are routinely placed in children's mouths, or are otherwise contaminated with body secretions, should be placed in the di rty toy box or segregated area after use27 Procedure for Cleaning Toys of No n-Infected/Well-Appearing Children27 Small toys may be wiped with a 70% alcohol swab and allowed to air dry. Rinsing with water is not necessary. Toys that will not be damaged by immersion should be cleaned as follows: o Clean in a dishwasher or the hot cycle of a washing machine 27 \u0083 Standard dishwasher or washing machine detergents may be used If a dishwasher or washing machine is not available: Hand wash with a soap and water wash using dishwashing soap o Scrub the toy in warm, soapy water \u0083 Use a brush or dishcloth to reach into the crevices and remove soil 26 o Rinse with clean water o Air dry or dry with a clean cloth After cleaning is accomplished, toys should be disinfected using the following guidelines: Spray or wipe the toy with an EPA registered disinfectant, ensuring all surfaces are wet for one minute 26 Allow toys to air dry or dry with a clean cloth Toys that are likely to be mouthed by infa nts and toddlers should be rinsed with clean water after they are disinfected to remove th e potential of chemical residue remaining on the toy (and thus be accidentally ingested) and then air dry or dry with a clean cloth.26,29 Toys that would be damaged by immersion (ke yboards, computer mice, hand-held electronic games, wind-up toys, etc) 23: Wipe with a 70% alcohol wipe/towelette, wiping and keeping the surface wet for 5 seconds Allow to air dry o Note: Alcohol wipes may damage the outside of electronic toys Procedure for Cleaning Toys of Infected/Isolated or Ill Children27 Children with symptoms of contagious diseas es (see the Infection Control Triage Form, Appendix D) should not be allowed in common pl ay areas until they are no longer symptomatic or considered non-contagious per a medical professional.26 The toy of any child who is visibly ill, or suspected of having an infectious disease, should remain with that child while they are ill. Toys used by ill children must be thoroughly cleane d and disinfected before sharing with other children. Follow the same procedures to clean and disinfect toys for an in fected/ill child that you would cleaning/disinfecting the t oys of a non-infected/w ell-appearing child. Any toy that cannot be cleaned and disinfected shoul d remain the sole property of that child, including being sent with the child when leaving the shelter. Handling and Cleaning Non-Communal Toys 27 Non-communal toys are those that are brought to the shelter by an individual child/family, those that cannot be shared due to the c onstruction of the toy (i.e., fabric), or all toys in shelters that do not have designated communal toy handling and cleaning/disinfection pr otocols. Non-communal toys should be monitored and cleaned by the pa rent/guardian of the child possessing the toy. Non-communal/shared toys s hould be handled using the following recommendations: Parents/guardians should discourage the shari ng of toys between ch ildren unless the toy has been cleaned Non-communal toys that will be shared between children should be handled using the following recommendations: Follow the same procedures to clean non-comm unal toys that will be shared between children as you would cleani ng the toys of a non-infect ed/well-appear ing child. Non-communal toys that will be shared be tween children do not require disinfection. 27 Pest Management Following a disaster, there will lik ely be an increase in insects and other pests in or around the shelter. Some pests can spread diseases, such as West Nile virus via the bite from an infected mosquito; others pests are just a nuisance. Rain and high water levels, such as after a hurricane or flood, may lead to an increase in the numbers of mosquitoes and other pests. Shelters should minimize and attempt to eliminat e vermin. Pest control should be included in the community disaster plan for shelters. Recomme ndations for pest management include the following 24: Eliminate food sources for pests (see the Food Safety section) Eliminate areas for nests, burrows, or breeding grounds Evaluate inside and outside of shelter for pot ential entrances for vermin, such as windows with torn or missing screens, doors propped ope n, standing water, etc and seal/eliminate any potential problem areas Work with a community pest co ntrol team/company if needed. Pet Management Some families may arrive at th e shelter with their pets. Close contact between animals and humans can pose an infection risk if the animal bites or scratches a human. Many shelters cannot accept animals because of health and safety regulations. 30 Community disaster plans should include provisions for pet shelters adjacent or close to human shelters. Shelter wo rkers should coordinate with local and state animal rescue ag encies to provide shelter for pets. If pets are to be housed in a shelter, the following recommenda tions should be used: Service dogs/animals should be allowed to st ay with their owner w ithin the shelter in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 23 All pets, except service dogs/animals, should be housed in a separate location4 o Pets should be screened fo r current vaccination status30 \u0083 If vaccinations are not up to date, the animal should be physically separated from other animals o Dogs and cats should be treated with medi cation to kill fleas, ticks, and intestinal parasites30 o Pregnant women or immunocompromised indi viduals should be instructed to avoid contact with used cat litter, cat feces, and pet rodents (h amsters, gerbils, and guinea pigs)30 o Children 5 years of age should not handle re ptiles without adult supervision and should perform hand hygiene after doing so30 o Anyone bitten, scratche d, or otherwise hurt by an an imal should be referred to a healthcare provider for assessment30 o Sheltered individuals should be instructed to not share food with their pets nor allow pets to lick their faces30 Sheltered individuals should perfo rm hand hygiene after visiting their pet in the pet shelter30 28 Pet food should be stored in a similar mann er as human food (see Food Safety section)19 Drinking water for pets should be stored in a similar manner as water for human consumption (see Water Management section). Post-Mortem Care Procedures for handling of the deceased ar e dictated by local and state regulations31; this should be part of community disaster planning that is coor dinated with local, regional, and federal disaster plans. In most situations, diseases do not surviv e long in a dead body; exceptions to this include smallpox and tuberculosis.32,33,34 Standard Precautions (see Appe ndix E) should be used when preparing the bodies of dead indi viduals for mortuary care to d ecrease the risk of infection transmission.31,35 Autopsies pose a high risk for infection transmission35 and should not be performed in shelters. Shelter wo rkers should coordinate post-mortem care with community, state, and federal disaster planning groups, including Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams (DMORT), local medical ex aminers, and coroners.35 29 References 1California Emergency Medical Services Au thority.

Standard Precautions (see Appendix E) should be used for all patient encounters. Individuals with severe or ra pidly progressive illnesses shou ld be referred to a medical professional or facility as soon as possible. 1If the disaster is an infectious disease disaster (bioterrorism or pandemic) an d the causative disease is known, the appropriat e isolation precautions for th at disease should be used. 2 Spatial Distancing involves se parating the potentially contagious person from others by a distance of at least 3 feet 3Transfer to medical faci lity as soon as possible 4Social Distancing for eye infections and vom iting consists of instructing the symptomatic individual or parent (if the individu al is a child) to remain with the family unit and away from other individuals in the shelter, perform frequent hand hygiene, and inform shelter workers if symptoms progress. These actions should continue unt il symptoms subside.

Wear appropriate personal protective e quipment (PPE) when exposure to blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions of individuals is anticipated.6 2. Remove all PPE in the room/area that in which it was used. 3. Perform hand hygiene before and after physical contact with each sheltered individual.36 4. Follow respiratory etiquette: a. Instruct individuals who ar e coughing to wear a mask b. Provide tissues for coughing individuals c. Instruct individuals to co ugh or sneeze into the crook of their elbow or sleeve d. Separate potentially infectious individua ls (by at least 3 feet) from others 5. Arrange all sleeping areas (i ncluding cots) so that individuals are separated a. Put 3 feet between individua l sleeping areas (or cots) to prevent the spread of infections37 b. Use head to toe sleeping configuratio ns for individuals (See Appendix G) Airborne Precautions [Isolation and respirato ry protection for airborne spread diseases will be very difficult to implem ent in shelters and will not be necessary for the majority of disasters. These individuals should be transferred to a medical facility as soon as possible. In the very rare event that individuals must be sheltered during an infectious disease disaster (such as a hurricane or flood occurri ng in a community at the same time as a pandemic), community planners should cons ider implementing the recommendations listed below to the extent possible to create a pr otective environment within the shelter.] Airborne precautions are to be used for all individuals meeting the criteria for requiring airborne precautions from Appendix D OR individuals known to have a known or potentially airborne disease: Tuberculosis , Chickenpox, Measles, Smallpox, SA RS, viral hemorrhagic fever, and Avian Influenza. In addition to Standard Precautions , the following should be implemented : 1. Place the symptomatic individual in a private isolation room/area a. An airborne infection isolation room (A IIR) should be used when available i. A single patient room that is equipped with special air handling and ventilation capacity that meets the American Institute of Architects/Facility Guidelines Ins titute (AIA/FGI) standards for AIIRs (i.e., monitored negative pressure re lative to the surrounding area, 12 air exchanges per hour for new constr uction and renovation and 6 air exchanges per hour for existing facilitie s, air exhausted directly to the outside or recirculated through HEPA filtration before return) 1 b. Temporary negative pressure rooms/ar eas can be developed using published guidelines and are permitted by federal a nd state codes for temporary, emergency needs.38,39 i. Choose an area as far from others as possible or use a naturally segregated area (a hallway or wing separate from the rest of the facility) 38 ii. Choose an area that has at least one window (The window must be > 25 feet away from air intakes, other open windows, or be more than 100 yards from another occupied building or high-risk area) to facilitate air flow iii. If walls do not enclose the isolation ro om/area already, erect some type of enclosure. Materials should be c hosen based on their permeability. 1. Potential barrier materials listed in order of preference: Drywall, particle board or other w ood, plastic, portable room divider/screens, hanging drapes, or bed linens 2. Secure barrier material to ceiling and floor to the extent possible iv. Bleed air from the isolation room/a rea to make it negative pressure compared to the rest of the shelte r using one of the following methods listed in order of preference: 1. A fixed room-air recirculation system 2. Portable room-air recirculation system 3. Centrifugal blower to exhaust air outside from the isolation room/are (the unit must exhaus t air out through a window) [The window must be > 25 feet away from air intakes, other open windows, or be more than 100 yards from another occupied building or high-risk area] 4. A specifically designed air cleaner (the unit must exhaust air out through a window) [The window must be > 25 feet away from air intakes, other open windows, or be more than 100 yards from another occupied building or high-risk area] 5. Use floor and/or window fans to exhaust air outside the isolation room/area a. Consult with a facilities engineer when setting up fans to create negative pressure v. Do not recirculate air from the isolat ion room/area with the rest of the shelter unless the air is filtered prior to recirculation. Ai r can be filtered using one of the following methods listed in order of preference: 1. Filter air from the isolation room/area using an in-duct high- efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter system 2. Filter air from the isolation room/area using a portable HEPA filter unit. The portable HEPA filter unit should be placed as close to the infected person(s) as possible, with out interfering with shelter staff work flow or medical equipment in the room a. Shelter workers should be told to avoid standing between the infected person and the por table HEPA unit's air intake because this can increase the sh elter worker's exposure risk 2. Keep the door closed/area separated and the symptomatic individual in the isolation area/room 3. Cohort individuals with the same syndrome 4. Wear respiratory protection a. Wear N-95 respirator or higher level when working within 3 feet of the symptomatic individual b. See Respirator section for guidance on how to proceed when N-95s are limited 39 5. Perform hand hygiene before and after cont act with the symptomatic individual. Droplet Precautions: Droplet precautions are to be us ed for all individuals meeting th e criteria for requiring droplet precautions from Appendix D OR individuals known to have a respiratory droplet spread disease: Meningitis, Seasonal Influen za, Pneumonic Plague, and Pertussis. In addition to Standard Precautions, the following should be implemented : 1. Separate the symptomatic individual a. Place in a private/isolation room/area b. Maintain a spatial separation fr om non-infected individuals. c. Keep the symptomatic individual in the isolation area/room. 2. Wear respiratory protection a. Wear surgical/procedure mask when work ing within 3 feet of the symptomatic individual b. See Mask section for guidance on how to proceed when masks are limited 3. Cohort individuals with the same syndrome. 4. Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the individual 5. Infected individuals should be instructed to wear a surgical/procedure mask if they are outside the isolation room/area a nd/or around susceptible individuals. Contact Precautions Contact precautions are to be used for all individuals meeting the criteria for requiring contact precautions from Appendix D OR individuals known to have an infectious disease spread by direct or indirect contact: infection from a multidrug resistant organism (MRSA, VRE, etc), C. difficile diarrhea, Smallpox, scabies, lice, uncon trollable vomiting/diarrhea, and/or wound drainage that cannot be contained by a dressing. In addition to Standard Precautions, the following should be implemented : 1. Separate the symptomatic individual a. Place in a private room/area b. Maintain a spatial separation fr om non-infected individuals. c. Keep the symptomatic individual in the isolation area/room. 2. Wear personal protective equipment when entering the room/area to give care to symptomatic individuals. a. A PPE/patient care gown i. See Gown section for guidance on how to proceed when gowns are limited b. Wear gloves when entering the isolation room/area. i. See Gloves section for guidance on how to proceed when gloves are limited 3. Cohort individuals with the same syndrome. 4. Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the individual. 40 APPENDIX F Respiratory Etiquette Poster7 42 APPENDIX H Hand Hygiene Techniques Alcohol Based Hand Rubs (ABHR)* Alcohol Based Hand Rubs do not require water for use and are the preferred method of hand hygiene when hands are not visibly dirty. Procedure for using Alcohol Based Hand Rubs: 1. Apply product to the palm of one hand us ing the following approximate amounts: o Liquid gel: dime-sized amount o Foam: egg-sized amount 2. Rub hands together 3. Rub the product over all surfaces of hands and fingers until hands are dry o Failure to cover all surfa ces of the hands and fingers will greatly reduce the efficacy of Alcohol Based Hand Rubs * Alcohol-based products should not be used in situations involving an outbreak of C. difficile or after exposure to Bacillus anth racis. The physical action of washing and rinsing hands under such circumstances is recommended because al cohols, chlorhexidine, iodophors, and other antiseptic agents have poor activity against spores.36 It should be noted that Alcohol Based Hand Rubs are not effective on hands that are visibly dirty or those contaminated with organic materials. Ha nds that are visibly dirt y or contaminated with organic material must be washed with soap and water, even if Alcohol Based Hand Rubs are to be used as an adjunct measure. Handwashing Handwashing involves the use of soap and water. Procedure for Handwashing: 1. Wet your hands with clean running water and apply soap* 2. Rub hands together to make lather and scrub all surfaces for 15-20 seconds, making sure you clean a. Under your nails b. Around your wrists c. In between your fingers 3. Rinse hands well under running water 4. Dry your hands with a paper towel or air dryer 5. If possible, use your paper towel to turn off the faucet 6. If possible, use paper to wel to open bathroom door 7. Dispose of paper towel *Plain soap should be used for handwashing unle ss otherwise indicated. If bar soap is used, it should be kept on racks that allow drainage of wa ter. If liquid soap is used, the dispenser should be replaced or cleaned and filled with fresh prod uct when empty; liquids should not be added to a partially full dispenser. Hand Hygiene using Antimicrobial-Imp regnated Wipes (i.e., towelettes) 43 Antimicrobial-impregnated wipes are not as eff ective as ABHRs or hand washing in reducing bacterial counts on the hands; theref ore, they are not a substitute for the hand hygiene procedures described above. However, if hand hygiene suppli es start to dwindle, antimicrobial-impregnated wipes (i.e., towelettes) may be cons idered as an alternative or as an adjunct to the use of ABHR or handwashing. Alcohol Based Hand Rubs* Procedure for using Alcohol Based Hand Rubs: Wet your hands with clean running water and apply soapRub hands together to make lather and scrub for 15-20 seconds Rinse hands well under running waterDry your hands with a paper towel or air dryerWash Your Hands: The Right Way! With either method, be sure to cover all surfaces of the hands and fingers including: a. Under your nails b. Around your wrists c. In between your fingersHandwashing Procedure for Handwashing: If possible, use your paper towel to turn off the faucet and open bathroom doorApply product to the palm of one hand using the following approximate amounts: Gel: dime-sized amount Foam: egg-sized amount Rub hands together until hands are dry, water is not required * Alcohol-based products are preferred in all cases except for visibly dirty hands, during an outbreak of C. difficile, or after exposure to Bacillus anthracis.APPENDIX I Hand Hygiene Poster 45 APPENDIX J PPE Usage Posters from CDC6 GOWN Fully cover torso from neck to knees, arms to end of wrist, and wrap around the back Fasten in back at neck and waist MASK OR RESPIRATOR Secure ties or elastic band at middle of head and neck Fit flexible band to nose bridge Fit snug to face and below chin Fit-check respirator GOGGLES/FACE SHIELD Put over face and eyes and adjust to fit GLOVES Extend to cover wrist of isolation gown SAFE WORK PRACTICES Keep hands away from face Limit surfaces touched Change when torn or heavily contaminated Perform hand h ygiene Putting on PPE Type of PPE used will vary based on the level of precautions required, e.g., Standard and Contact, Droplet or Airborne Isolation Precautions 46 REMOVING PPE Remove PPE at doorway before leaving patient room or in anteroom; remove respirator outside of room PERFORM HAND HYGIENE Immediately after removing PPEGLOVES Outside of gloves are contaminated!
