People Eczema can be a real pain \u2014 in every sense of the word. Unlike pimples, a hands-off approach won't necessarily make the itchy, flaky, irritated patches go away. But luckily, over-the-counter products can help \u2014 namely moisturizing creams. \"Look for emollient and humectant ingredients, such as dermatologist Ramya Garlapati, MD. To help you narrow down your options, we tried 16 formulas firsthand. Our testers assessed whether the creams actually made a difference in their eczema flare-ups, then evaluated the texture and overall value. These are the best eczema creams PEOPLE tested.

We applied it daily to our arms, legs, and hands after showering. We noticed an immediate improvement after the first application, noting the soothing and hydrating feeling. This lotion leans on colloidal oatmeal to relieve itchiness and irritation and thermal spring water to calm and heal damaged skin. It also contains shea butter and glycerin, a couple of Dr. Garlapati's go-tos for sealing in moisture. The formula is somewhat thick, which can make it hard to spread. It's slightly greasy, too, but overall, we like the silky consistency and appreciate how quickly it absorbs. It feels like a luxurious experience to apply this cream, though it's available at drugstores. Not only does this product soothe inflammation and smooth uneven texture, but it also leaves you with hydrated skin that lasts all day. Price at Time of Publish: $14.39 Key Ingredients: Colloidal oatmeal, thermal spring water, shea butter, glycerin | Amount: 6.8 ounces People Best Overall, Runner Up CeraVe Eczema Relief Creamy Oil 5 Target View On Amazon View On Target View On Walmart Our Ratings Efficacy 5/5 Texture 5/5 Value 5/5 Pros Instant soothing relief upon first application thanks to colloidal oatmeal Feels lightweight on the skin and absorbed easily with minimal need for rubbing in Long-term hydration helps heal stubborn flairs instantly and over time with nourishing safflower oil and ceramides Great value for the 8 ounces of product that comes in the bottle (plus a little goes a long way) Cons We really can't think of any! If you're looking for a product that gets to work fast, then this oil-cream hybrid from CeraVe might be just the thing. This impressive lotion calmed our skin instantly (thanks to soothing colloidal oatmeal), and with the help of ceramides, it hydrated and protected our delicate skin, too. The immediate effects of this cream were beyond compare, and we found even more relief in the next few days of application. This cream had particular success in treating a flareup on the hands and fingers in our testing process, which can be a stubborn area to treat because of hand and dishwashing. We found immediate relief with this CeraVe cream, which has a beautiful texture that feels somewhere between a lightweight lotion and a thick cream. And while we were absolutely blown away with the short term relief, we were even more shocked by the long term results. Within one day of initial application, the flare was visibly reduced. Within a few, it was almost entirely gone. That's right: gone. Though the CeraVe cream makes use of safflower oil (and has the word oil in the name), we didn't find the texture oily at all. It absorbed well once worked into the skin and left behind a smooth feeling that wasn't sticky to the touch. If you're looking for a cream that you actually look forward to applying, then this one is definitely worth it's weight in gold. Overall, this cream is so great that we really couldn't find anything that we didn't absolutely love about it! Price at Time Key Ingredients: ceramides Best Budget Vaseline Clinical Care Eczema Calming Therapy Cream 4.3 Walmart View On Walmart Our Ratings Efficacy 4.5/5 Texture 4/5 Pros Performed as well as some of the most expensive options Easily absorbs without leaving behind any greasy finish Doesn't sting or burn on cracked skin Provided immediate soothing relief on stubborn flare-ups on our hands thanks to soothing colloidal oatmeal Cons Watery texture can get messy on the lid The texture of this affordable cream is similar to melted ice cream, but despite the lightweight consistency, this stuff works. In our testing process, we found that our cracked, dry hands were instantly soothed upon application. The Vaseline Clinical Care Eczema cream is one of the most affordable products on our list, which is why we were a bit surprised with its effectiveness. It feels slightly wet on the skin immediately after application, but after about a minute, we found that it absorbed completely without a tacky or clumpy feel. Perhaps best of all, this cream didn't sting or burn upon application in our tests \u2014 even on sensitive, cracked skin. The product comes in tube packaging that makes it easy to squeeze out large globs of cream at a time, but it can also be a bit messy because of the cream's watery texture. Overall, our tests proved that the Vaseline Clinical Care Eczema cream is well worth its pocket-friendly price. Price at Time of Publish: jelly, ounces Best Investment DermaDoctor Calm Cool Corrected Eczema Repair Balm 5 DermaDoctor View On Amazon View On Walmart View On Walmart Our Ratings Efficacy 5/5 Texture 5/5 Value 5/5 Pros Rich, smooth consistency feels nourishing yet lightweight enough to apply to the delicate eye area Immediate improvement on our stubborn flare-ups, including behind the knees and under the eye Accepted by National Eczema Association Cons High price per ounce compared to most of the options on our list If you're willing to spend a bit more on a formula that actually lives up to its claims, DermaDoctor won't let you down. This luxuriously rich eczema cream calls on colloidal oatmeal and ceramides to soothe, protect, and hydrate the skin. After applying it behind our knees, collarbone, and eye crease, we were blown away by the results. This cream has a Seal of Acceptance from the National Eczema Association (NEA), meaning it's safe for sensitive skin and effective at managing eczema symptoms. Almost immediately, we saw a noticeable improvement in our flare-ups, with reduced itchiness and redness. Price at Time $35 Key Ingredients: Colloidal Best Balm Aveeno Eczema Therapy Nighttime Itch Relief Balm 4.7 Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On CVS Our Ratings Efficacy 4/5 Texture 5/5 Value 4.5/5 Pros Comes with 11 ounces of product in a large tub so that you can scoop out every last bit Instant hydration on dry hands and long-term improvement in hand skin flexibility Accepted by National Eczema Association Cons May sting on cracked skin Not ideal for severe eczema Some of the best eczema creams can be found at your local drugstore. Aveeno Nighttime Itch Relief Balm comes in a generously sized tub and boasts a smooth, not-too-sticky consistency. We found it easy to apply and absorbed quickly, though it stung briefly on cracked areas. We noticed instant relief from symptoms upon slathering it on, and a half-hour later, our hands were really flexible and less irritated. What's more, the results got better after continued use. The calming, hydrating formula cleared up some mild patches. And while we think it's a good daily moisturizer for preventing flare-ups, it may not be as effective for severe eczema. Price at Time of Publish: $19.68 Key Ingredients: People Best Hydrating CeraVe Moisturizing Cream 4.8 Amazon View On Amazon View On Target View On Walmart Our Ratings Feel/Consistency 5/5 Absorption 5/5 Dryness 5/5 Appearance 4/5 Value 5/5 Pros Large tub comes with 19 ounces of product, making this one of the best deals on our list Improves smoothness and elasticity with hydrating ceramides and hyaluronic acid Accepted by National Eczema Association Cons Not ideal for severe flare-ups, meant to be more of a daily lotion Looking for a daily moisturizer? CeraVe might be your best bet. We used this ultra-thick cream as an all-over body lotion and loved how well it hydrated our legs, elbows, and heels. It absorbs quickly and makes her skin feel instantly more elastic. It did a decent job of smoothing the dry, scaly skin on our hands too. And while this product has the National Eczema Association's stamp of approval, it wasn't super effective at healing eczema patches, so you might need a prescription product when dealing with more stubborn flare-ups. Price at Time of Publish: $25 Key Ingredients: Petrolatum, glycerin | Amount: 16 ounces The 10 Best CeraVe Products of 2023 Best for Body Vanicream Moisturizing Cream for Sensitive Skin 4.9 Target View On Amazon View On Target View On Walmart Our Ratings Efficacy 4.5/5 Texture 5/5 Value 4.5/5 Pros Smooth, velvety texture feels almost balm-like on the skin Offers instant hydration with petroleum jelly to create a barrier and prevent further moisture loss Accepted by National Eczema Association Cons Doesn't absorb quickly, and takes some working into the skin to spread Not ideal for severe flare-ups Vanicream is another great drugstore option. We found that this affordable body lotion not only brought instant hydration, but also prevented our skin from drying out. Its hero ingredient is petrolatum, one of the emollients Dr. Garlapati recommends for eczema. Also known as petroleum jelly (generic for Vaseline), it addresses raised patches, smooths uneven texture, and locks in moisture. One thing about petroleum-based products is that they can be hard to spread and don't absorb very quickly. However, we still appreciated the smooth and silky texture. And although this product did a decent job of healing mild flare-ups, it might not be as effective on severe eczema. Price at Time of Publish: $13.56 Key Ingredients: Petrolatum | Amount: 16 ounces The 8 Best Clinical Strength Deodorants of 2023, Tested and Reviewed Best with Psoriasis Relief Wild Naturals Eczema & Psoriasis Cream 4.9 Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On Wildnaturals.com Our Ratings Efficacy 4.5/5 Texture 5/5 Value 4.5/5 Pros Glides smoothly onto skin Soothing ingredients like manuka honey and aloe vera provide instant relief from discomfort Shea butter and coconut oil lock in moisture for long-term hydration Cons High price per ounce compared to some of the other options we tried If you're battling both eczema and psoriasis, go with Wild Naturals. We were pleasantly surprised by how well this cream works. The plant-based formula contains healing manuka honey, soothing aloe vera, shea butter, and coconut oil to lock in moisture and calm inflammation. Though it's super thick, this lotion glides smoothly onto the skin. Not only did this cream offer instant relief from symptoms, but it also helped keep flare-ups at bay. We were so impressed with the results, that we're seriously considering replacing all of our face and body lotions with this one. While the price per ounce is a little steep, we think it's worth the investment. Price at Time of Publish: $24.95 Key Ingredients: Manuka honey, aloe vera, shea butter, coconut oil | Amount: 4 ounces Best for Families Mustela Stelatopia Emollient Balm with Sunflower Oil 5 Amazon View On Amazon View On Ecosmetics.com View On Mustelausa.com Our Ratings Efficacy 5/5 Texture 5/5 Pros Gentle formula is safe for use on children and sensitive skin Absorbs with minimal rubbing Relieves dryness and redness over time Cons Thick textured balm takes some time to work into the skin After three uses of the Mustela Stelatopia Emollient Balm, we noticed a big difference in the eczema patches on sensitive areas of the skin, including the crease of the arms and knees. Though it feels thick at first, this balm rubs into the skin and leaves barely a trace of stickiness behind. Another win for sensitive skin (on both children and parents alike), this eczema-healing cream is fragrance-free, which means less potential for allergic reactions or irritation. Healing ingredients like avocado perseose and soothing sunflower oil distillate are the stars of this balm, which is marketed as being \"gentle enough for newborns.\" Mustela is also a B Corp-certified company, which means it's striving to create a better world both socially and environmentally. Price at Time of Publish: $36.60 Key Ingredients: Avocado perseose, sunflower oil distillate | 6.76 ounces Best for Families (Less Expensive) Honest Eczema Soothing Therapy Balm 4.7 Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On Honest.com Our Ratings Efficacy 5/5 Texture 4/5 Value 4.5/5 Pros Gentle formula is kid-friendly Immediate improvement of red spots on toddler's skin Relieves dryness and redness with extended use Cons Must be warmed in-hand in order to spread onto the skin Hard to spread, even once warmed, and takes some time to work into the skin We tested this gentle, kid-friendly cream on our toddler's eczema patches after bath time. There was an immediate improvement in the appearance of the spots, and after ongoing use, most of the redness and dryness was gone. Since it's technically a balm, this product is very thick and creamy. It's slightly chunky when you scoop it out of the container, and you have to warm it between your hands to get it to spread. It goes on more like a paste than a lotion. Still, a little goes a long way, and it definitely gets the job done. Price at Time of Publish: $14.28 Key Ingredients: Colloidal oatmeal, shea butter, coconut oil, aloe vera | Amount: 3 ounces People Best for Hands Eczema Honey Oatmeal Body Lotion 4.3 Amazon View On Amazon View On Target View On Walmart Our Ratings Efficacy 4.5/5 Texture 3.6/5 Pros Instantly soothes skin irritation with honey and colloidal oatmeal Faint but pleasant scent A little goes a long way, so the price feels justified Very effective on mild flare-ups Cons May not be as effective on stubborn flare-ups Takes time and effort to rub into the skin Our hands go through a lot \u2014 from constant handwashing and sanitizing to dishwashing. So, it makes sense that the hands are a common source of eczema suffering. Luckily, this soothing cream exists to ease pain and leave hands feeling soft and supple. In our testing, we found that the irritated bumps that generally arise on the skin of our hands after a day of washing was immediately soothed upon application of the Eczema Honey Oatmeal Body Lotion. We applied the cream after we washed our hands and found instant relief and soothing on small flare-ups that were caused by handwashing and dry air. The cream goes on thick and takes a bit of elbow grease to work into the skin. We found a full pump of the bottle to be too much product at once, so keep in mind that a little goes a long way. The lotion has a faint, pleasant scent, which is also important to keep in mind if you're looking for a completely unscented product. Price at Time of Publish: $21.56 Key Ingredients: Cocoa butter, shea butter, aloe vera, organic honey | Amount: 16 ounces 10 Best Hand Creams of 2023, Tested and Reviewed Best Anti-Itch Vanicream HC 1% Hydrocortisone Anti-Itch Cream 4.6 Amazon View On Amazon Our Ratings Efficacy 4.5/5 Texture 4.7/5 Pros Relieves itchiness immediately with hydrocortisone Absorbs into the skin quickly with minimal rubbing Cons Doesn't feel super hydrating or soothing Hydrocortisone can help relieve some of the itchiness that often arises with an eczema flare. This gentle formula from Vanicream highlights 1 percent hydrocortisone, which worked quickly to relieve any itching that we had. The formula is lightweight and thin and doesn't leave behind any tacky finish. The non-greasy cream specializes in relieving itchiness but might not be as effective at soothing or moisturizing the skin as some of the other creams that we tried. But, for someone looking to stop scratching at their already irritated skin, the Vanicream 1% Hydrocortisone cream could be a great addition to your eczema-fighting regimen. Price at Time of Publish: $9.99 Key Ingredients: Hydrocortisone | Amount: 2 ounces Best Instant Relief Cetaphil Restoraderm Flare-Up Relief Cream 4.8 Amazon View On Amazon View On Target View On Walmart Our Ratings Efficacy 4.5/5 Texture 5/5 Pros Instant relief on painfully dry hands with soothing colloidal oatmeal Left our rough, dry hands feeling soft and smooth Rubbed in quickly with minimal effort Cons Texture is very thick, and we could feel it sitting on top of our skin slightly Has a slight chemical-y smell If you're someone who's suffered with eczema, you know just how up-hill that battle can sometimes feel. After one application of this soothing cream from Cetaphil, our hands felt smooth, soft, and silky in a way that we'd long thought was impossible for us to achieve. We'd describe the texture of this cream as something close to cold soft-serve \u2014 meaning it's thick. Despite the thick texture, the Cetaphil Eczema Restoraderm rubbed into our skin shockingly fast and left behind no stickiness or heaviness. Our hands were left feeling soft and smooth, thanks to soothing ingredients like colloidal oatmeal. While the price might feel a bit shocking at first sight, the $19 that you're paying for the Cetaphil Eczema Restoraderm gets you 8 ounces of product, which is a pretty good deal per ounce. The product does have a slightly chemical-y smell, which may be offputting for some people. But, overall, we love this instantly relieving and long-term hydrating cream. Price at Time of Publish: $19.97 Key Ingredients: Filaggrin technology, colloidal oatmeal ounces Best for Travel Evereden Healing Eczema Treatment 4.3 Ever Eden View On Amazon View On Ever-eden.com Our Ratings Efficacy 4.5/5 Texture 4.1/5 Pros The convenient pump-bottle tube is TSA-friendly Instantly soothes the skin with colloidal oatmeal and restores skin barrier over time with ceramides Cleared up an eczema flareup on toddler skin Cons Product doesn't absorb well, leaves a streaky or greasy finish Within a week, we saw a big difference in our skin (and in delicate toddler skin) with daily use of the Evereden Healing Eczema Treatment. The product comes in a small, convenient tube that's easy to stuff into a purse or luggage without taking up much room. Colloidal oatmeal helps to soothe dryness and itchiness immediately, and we found that our skin felt more hydrated over time. The Evereden cream would make a great overnight cream. This formula looked a bit streaky on the skin, but with a little extra rubbing, we could rub the cream in so that it left a finish that we'd describe as greasy, which might feel nice overnight but bothersome during your day-to-day. But, overall, this convenient travel-sized tube is small enough to clear TSA and works to clear up eczema flare-ups. Price at Time of Publish: oatmeal, golden spent barley, quercetin | Amount: 1.7 ounces Things to Consider Before Buying an Eczema Cream Emollients and Humectants According to Dr. Garlapati, the best eczema creams contain protective, lubricating emollients and humectants, which draw water in from the air to keep the skin hydrated. This includes petrolatum, shea butter, squalane, ceramides, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid. \"These ingredients work to rehydrate, repair, and maintain the normal skin barrier, which is defective in eczema,\" she says. She adds that they also aid in reducing dry, irritated, and inflamed skin. Soothing and Healing Ingredients Dr. Garlapati is also a fan of colloidal oatmeal for eczema. Though it's technically an emollient, this go-to ingredient goes above and beyond moisturizing to relieve itchiness and calm inflammation. Other ingredients that help soothe irritation and heal flare-ups include aloe vera, manuka honey, thermal spring water, and petroleum jelly. Our top pick for eczema relief, La Roche-Posay Lipikar Soothing Relief Eczema Cream, contains colloidal oatmeal, thermal spring water, shea butter, and glycerin, so it's packed with emollients, humectants, and soothing ingredients. National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance Some moisturizing creams have a National Eczema Association (NEA) Seal of Acceptance. This doesn't necessarily mean a product will do wonders in clearing and preventing flare-ups. However, it's a good indicator that the formula will help you manage symptoms and won't further irritate sensitive skin. People How We Tested After consulting with dermatologist Claire Wolinsky, MD, we researched top-rated eczema creams, and our editors selected 16 formulas to try firsthand. Our eczema-prone testers took a \"before\" photo of their skin and used each product daily for a full two weeks. They noted the consistency, absorption, and overall feel of the creams and whether they left stains or greasy marks on clothing or bedding. Our testers also assessed how effective the formulas were at soothing irritation and clearing patches. After two weeks, they took an \"after\" photo to check for visible improvement. Each product was scored for efficacy, texture, and value, and those with the highest overall ratings were selected for this roundup. Frequently Asked Questions What cream is best for eczema? The best cream for eczema is a deeply moisturizing, protective, healing formula that lubricates dry patches. According to our tests, the most affordable and effective options are La Roche-Posay Lipikar Eczema Soothing Relief Cream and Wild Naturals Eczema & Psoriasis Cream. But if you're just looking for a daily moisturizer for eczema-prone skin, go with CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. What heals eczema quickly? \"Corticosteroids, which are available as creams, solutions, gels, foams, and ointments, can provide rapid relief of eczema symptoms,\" says Dr. Garlapati. \"These are available as over-the-counter options, as well as stronger, prescription-strength treatments.\" What do dermatologists recommend for eczema? \"Treatment for eczema depends on the severity of the condition,\" says Dr. Garlapati, \"But certain practices apply to all patients with eczema.\" This includes bathing in lukewarm water, limiting showers to about 10 minutes, and using hypoallergenic, fragrance-free skincare products that keep the skin moisturized without irritation.
