Chapter 3 is a wholly new addition, using material originally gathered for the earlier work. Other modifications in the body of the text are relatively minor; the passage of five years has entailed no changes in the original analyses or opinions but has necessitated an expansion of the footnotes to incorporate subsequent bibliography. The manuscript was closed as of May 1992, and only sources available to me by that date have been included. The reader may be struck by an apparent inconsistency in the use of hieroglyphic fonts throughout this volume. The use of \"Normalschrift\" fonts has been confined only to generic references to individual words and signs. In contrast, whenever a specific textual passage or edition is excerpted (whether in hieroglyphic, hieratic, or Demotic script), an attempt has been made to reproduce the original text or edition by computer scanner. It is hoped that any loss in aesthetics will be counterbalanced by an increase in accuracy. In the preparation of this study, I have benefited from the sagacity, experience, and endurance of many, and it is a pleasure to acknowledge their contributions. The original dissertation committee comprised Drs. Klaus Baer, Robert D. Biggs, Janet H. Johnson, and Edward F. Wente, chairman and early source of inspiration. As teachers and colleagues, they have contributed to the fruition of this project in countless ways. In particular, Janet Johnson has continued to provide unflagging support, and our association on the Chicago Demotic Dictionary Project has been of primary importance for my scholastic development. Her invaluable computer skills have also enabled the use of textual scans in this volume. The untimely death of Klaus Baer has deprived Egyptology of a singularly rigorous scholar and irreplaceable teacher. His insistence on precision in methodology and detail has shaped the themes of my own work, from our first lessons in the Egyptian language. His enthusiasm for the present study remains a source of pride. Dr. George R. Hughes, who came out of retirement to guide my initial study of Demotic, has been a constant source of encouragement-especially helpful on days when the thought of researching yet another footnote was unendurable. Additional thanks are due to colleagues and students who offered support, advice, or information: William Brashear, Hans D. Betz, Susan Clark, Walter Farber, Richard Jasnow, Charles Jones, Joe Manning, John Nolan, Martha Roth, Terry Wilfong, and the late David Wilmot. Proffered suggestions and references are acknowledged individually within the relevant footnotes; responsibility for all other phraseology, opinions, and citations remains exclusively that of the author. Family and friends have been unstinting in their support. Chief among them are my parents, Robert and Margaret Ritner, and my brother and sister-in-law, Richard and Jody Ritner, and their family. My parents, to ix oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE whom this work is dedicated, have been instrumental in its completion, for without their exhortations to \"finish the dissertation\" I would still be inserting additional references to my discussion of phr. For enduring the brunt of my daily bouts with academia, an additional dedication is made to Dr. Neil J. Krakauer and Finghin. Neil in particular acted as a sounding board for each thought as I conceived it, each sentence as I penned it. His relief at the completion of this task can be no less than my own. To John Larson, Oriental Institute Archivist, I am especially indebted for the photographic material which accompanies this work. His efforts have been thorough, tireless, and far above the requirements of duty and friendship. Further thanks are owed to my dissertation editor, Joan Hives, who patiently labored with this manuscript in various incarnations through the endless petty tomfoolery of bureaucracy and computer. Her Herculean efforts have rendered the subsequent publication a simple matter. For overcoming the ultimate technicalities of publication, I wish to thank the Oriental Institute's Publications Office directed by Tom Holland, and especially my careful editor, Richard Schoen. A final, but heartfelt gratitude, is owed to my graduate students at Yale, Jennifer Houser, Mark Stone, and Pascale Teysseire, who assisted me in the laborious but crucial task of proofreading the completed manuscript.

Most often, the determination of \"magic\" has relied solely upon the subjective interpretation of the attitude of the ancient practitioner as surmised from the contents of recited spells. In keeping with the early anthropological theories of Frazer and Malinowski, \"magic\" was to be distinguished from \"religion\" by the former's threatening attitude and its limited, personal goals. Unfortunately, these criteria are inadequate for delineating Egyptian practice, as they frequently characterize standard cultic (\"religious\") texts as well. As a result, the same texts have been labeled \"magical\" by certain scholars though \"religious\" by others. A common solution has been the adoption of the noncommittal phrase \"magico-religious,\" and certain scholars, following Claude L6vi-Strauss, have suggested that the category be abandoned altogether. Justification for the retention of the category \"magic\" is suggested by the existence of native terminology (ik:) which was ultimately equated with Western \"magic\" in the Coptic (Christian) period. However, an examination of the older Egyptian concept and its associated vocabulary, mythology, and theology reveals fundamental distinctions between the range and meaning of \"magic\" within the two cultures. Rather than imposing a universal definition of \"magic\" on both, the present thesis adopts an \"emic\" approach in which Egyptian and Western concepts are evaluated independently, and in their own terms. In order to obtain a \"working definition\" of the Western definition of \"magic,\" a new method was selected in which activity serves as the diagnostic criterion. For the purposes of this study, any activity that seeks to obtain its goal outside the natural laws of cause and effect is designated as \"magical\" in the modern Western sense. Using such a \"working definition,\" the identification of \"magical\" elements within spells, rituals, literature, and archaeological artifacts is relatively simple, and a brief selection of these are surveyed regarding both synchronic distribution and diachronic development: circumambulation, spitting, blowing, licking, swallowing, the use of images, superposition, trampling, binding, I oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE the use of red, breaking, the use of sand, burning, numerological symbolism, piercing, decapitation, reversal, burial, the use of the dead, and oracular consultations. Cross-cultural parallels are noted for contrast and comparison. The identity of the magician, his social role, and his significance in the continuity of this tradition are also examined. The \"private\" magician is revealed to be none other than the cultic priest, in \"private practice\" during interims in temple service. Thus can be explained the identity of \"magical\" acts in private and public ceremonies, as well as the similarity of ritual texts and \"magical\" spells; all were composed, compiled, and performed by the same individuals. To date, no treatment of Egyptian magic has concentrated upon the actual practice of the magician. Both general studies and textual publications have emphasized instead the religious elements in the contents of recited spells, while the accompanying instructions with their vignettes and lists of materials, instruments, and ritual actions remained uninvestigated. This study represents the first critical examination of such \"magical techniques,\" revealing their widespread appearance and pivotal significance for all Egyptian \"religious\" practices from the earliest periods through the Coptic era, influencing as well the Greco-Egyptian magical papyri. Performed by priests as the technique of religion, Egyptian \"magic\" cannot be opposed to religion, and the Western dichotomy of \"religion vs. magic\" is thus inappropriate for describing Egyptian practice. This continuum of \"magical mechanics\" vitiates as well the oft-repeated suggestion of religious decline and magical increase in the later periods. Corresponding to the merger of Egyptian religion and magic as obtained from the Western definition, Egyptian concepts of magic are shown to be pivotal for indigenous religious life, underlying not merely cultic practice but all sacral speculation, forming an \"imagistic theory\" that bonds the tenets of religion to the techniques of religion. Only with the conversion of Egypt to Christianity is this theology abandoned, and \"magic\" reinter- preted in the debased meaning which it maintains in the modern West. oi.uchicago.eduCHAPTER 1 TOWARD A DEFINITION OF MAGIC Denn die Zauberei und alles was des Agyptertums Wilhelm Spiegelberg 1932b, p. 101 Ten measures of magic have come into the world. Egypt received nine of these, the rest of the world one measure. Talmud, b. Qid. 49b oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE In any discussion of magical spells and techniques, one is at once confronted by the complete absence of any shared criteria for exactly what constitutes \"magic.\" All too often, the religious and medical practices of one culture or era become \"magic\" when viewed from the perspective of another. Perhaps nowhere is this clearer than in the case of the developing Christian church, which was prosecuted for magical acts by pagan Rome, in turn persecuted pagans and \"heretics\" for the same offense when it attained power, and, finally, was again the subject of denunciations for magical practices by schismatic Protestant groups.' Similarly, many of the medical prescriptions of the Roman author Pliny would certainly be considered \"magical\" today, despite the author's denunciation of magicians and their practice.2 This vagary inherent in the modern word \"magic\"-being applied by personal whim to beliefs stigmatized as evil or false-parallels the derogatory evolution of the word \"myth\" and, like it, seems to be a legacy of the Greco-Roman world.3 So ingrained has this viewpoint become in Western thought that two very serious consequences have arisen for all modern Egyptological studies of the concept. First, the negative connotations of \"magic\"-whether as fraudulent sham or misguided \"science\" have prevented truly sympathetic treatments of the phenomena in Egypt. Thus previous scholars, when constrained to discuss the topic, expressly state their distaste for the material.4 Bounded by religion on the one hand, and on the other by medicine, magic has been considered inferior to both and has often received only perfunctory treatment in the i. For an overview of the reciprocal accusations of magic by pagan and Christian, see Poupon 1981; Brown 1970; Barb 1963; and MacMullen 1966, pp. 95-127. Protestant accusations of magic against Catholicism are discussed in Thomnas 1971, pp. 51-77 and passim. 2. Compare Pliny. Natural History, 30.25 for the use of a dead serpent as an amulet, 30.49 for aphrodisiacs, and note 30.30, where Pliny turns to magical remedies in the case of quartan fevers for which \"ordinary medicine\" was felt to he useless. These prescriptions all appear in a chapter which begins with an expos6 of magic as \"the most fraudulent of arts\" (30.1). The question of Pliny's relationship to Roman magic is discussed in Tavenner 1916, pp. 56-59 and 74-75. 3. The pejorative use of the term \"magic\" to describe the beliefs and practices of one's enemies (in contrast to the term \"religion\" reserved for one's own beliefs and practices) is skillfully traced in Segal 1981. The complexity of this development, and the consequent confusion of categories of \"religion\" and \"magic\" within the Greco-Roman world itself, is clearly surveyed in Morton Smith 1983. 4. E.g., H. Brugsch Sprache darbieten\"; Budge 1901, p. xi: and most degraded character\": Erman 1907, p. 148: \"it is precisely the youthful unsophisticated nations that are most readily attracted by it\"; and Lexa 1925. vol. 1, p. 12: \"Plus la culture nationale est basse et plus le nombre d'hommes clair6s est restreint, plus est grande l'influence de la magie.\" These last statements are demonstrably false. In western Europe, the social repercussions of belief in magic and witchcraft were far greater in the Renaissance than in the Middle Ages, and the beliefs were stronger among the educated than among the general population (Douglas 1970, pp. xxxi-xxxiii). oi.uchicago.eduTOWARD A DEFINITION OF MAGIC study of either.5 Second, the very uncertainty of the exact lines of demarcation (if any exist) of the boundaries between religion, magic, and medicine has rendered the theoretical distinctions between them untenable in practice. The designation of any given text as \"magical\" as opposed to \"religious\" or \"medical\" is often highly problematic and subjective. The very presence of a spell within a medical context has sufficed to stigmatize that recipe as \"magical\" even when the accompanying format for treatment is indistin- guishable from others within the same papyrus.6 With regard to religion, emphasis has been placed upon the phraseology of the recitation and the attitude of the speaker. Seen always from a Western perspective, \"religion\" was to be distinguished from magic by the pious attitude of the practitioner, the humble supplication of its prayers, and the noble, all- inclusive world view of its rituals and theology. In contrast, magic demanded hubris and blasphemy of its devotees, its spells did not beg but threaten, and its goals were immediate, limited, and personal.7 The limitations of this approach become readily apparent when one attempts to apply it to actual texts. Most notably, the funerary literature-Pyramid Texts, Coffin Texts, Book of the Dead, and various texts in the royal tombs of the New 5. For the supposed inferiority of magic to religion, see n. 3, above. With regard to medicine, the magisterial nine volume Grundriss der Medizin der alten Agypter, edited by Grapow, van Deines, and (1954-73) devotes only sixteen pages (Grapow 1955, pp. 11-26) to magic, and then only to a discussion of recited spells. Techniques of medical magic are not analyzed. Similarly, magical practitioners are dismissed as \"non-medical\" in Ghalioungui 1983, p. 68 and compare p. 48: \"I also exclude any magicians who were not at the same time swnw.\" This reflects modern-not ancient- categorization. An early reaction against this common disinterest was voiced by W. M. Muller in his Papyrus Edwin Smith, case 9, col. 4/19-5/5, in Breasted 1930, pp. 217-24. Despite Breasted's rather harsh judgment (p. 217) of this prescription as a \"grotesque product of superstition\" and a \"characteristic product of the recipe-hawking physician (as contrasted with the surgeon),\" it is not so aberrant in its composition, which comprises an examination and treatment including a compress and bandaging. The presence of magical elements in this prescription need not reflect, as Breasted thought, an interpolation by a later scribe, but more likely results from the nature of the injury to be treated, a fractured skull incurable by contemporary medicine. Compare the reaction of Pliny to magical treatment of quartan fever in n. 2, above. The absence of additional magical elements in Pap. Edwin Smith seems equally a result of the type of injuries discussed. Most are simple fractures of obvious physical origin and correspondingly straightforward treatment. Had the text dealt with disease, recommendations for magical practice might well have been more numerous (Wilson 1952). Magical treatments are increasingly recognized as complementary, rather than opposed, to \"rational\" Egyptian medical practice (Walker 1990). 7. See Moret 1906; H. I. Bell 1953, p. 12; Morenz 1973, p. 98; and Barb 1963, pp. 100-01. The most complete formulation of this theory is found in Goode 1949, pp. 172-82 and 1951, pp. 50-55. These distinctions have recently been adopted for New Testament study in Aune 1980, pp. 1512-16 and were already traditional in Festugibre 1932, pp. 281-328, especially p. 289. oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE Kingdom-have proved resistant to consensual classification. Clearly designed for a single individual (the tomb owner), these \"personal\" texts yet provide the greatest insights into the broader religious concerns of the country, including the relation of gods to men, the conception of the afterlife, the judgment of sins, et cetera. Moreover, there is little hesitancy on the part of the speaker of these spells to mingle praise and threats, respectful \"prayer\" and demands.8 Opinions as to the nature of this literature has, accordingly, varied.9 These limitations become far more acute, however, when one finds that the same text may appear in both \"magical\" and \"religious\" contexts. Thus the Harris \"Magical\" Papyrus whose title describes it as containing spells to enchant crocodiles includes well-known hymns to the god Shu found equally in \"mainstream\" religious usage upon temple walls at Philae and Hibis.1o Divorced from their context, these texts are indistinguishable. Primary dependence upon the spoken spell as the indicator of a magical text is thus clearly unreliable, and editors are often at a loss to make any formal distinction. T. G. H. James may be said to exemplify the problem, while seeking to avoid it, by styling a papyrus \"magico-religious.\"II Nowhere is the subjective nature of present classification more evident than in the treatment accorded Papyrus Salt 825 (= Papyrus BM 10051). First published by Birch in felt to pertain to \"la magie la plus absurde.\"12 In preparing the second edition of 1965, Derchain was at first of the same opinion. .. of his analysis, however, Derchain became aware of correspondences between the text and contemporary rituals, and radically re-evaluated the papyrus. 8. In refutation of the assumption that prayer is antithetical to magic, see the comments on the image of the god of magic (Hteka) praying the universe into being in te Velde 1970, p. 183. 9. Compare Erman 1907, p. 10)0: \"All these anxieties and all this magic scarcely appear in the Pyramid texts, with the exception of a series of spells against snakes,\" with Borghouts 1974, p. 7: \"It is a current opinion that the whole body of Pyramid Texts and its successors ... may be called magical in its approach to the world of things unseen,\" following Morenz 1973, p. 99: \"... mortuary texts, although they contain religious material, are not themselves religious but magical in nature and purpose,\" and ibid., p. 229: \"To put it in a nutshell, mortuary texts are magical texts.\" 10.

The originally perceived magical elements were still clear to Borghouts in 1972 when he felt compelled to include the papyrus in his study of magical texts, even while accepting its reclassification as \"ritual.\"16 If present methods have been unsuccessful in uniformly isolating magical materials, the fault may lie not only in undue emphasis placed upon the spoken spell, but also in the operative definitions of \"magic\" utilized by different scholars. Such variance in the underlying definition of magic has obviously influenced the differing interpretations of Papyrus Salt 825 as mentioned above. Most often, no formal definition of magic accompanies studies of the subject as the investigator has assumed-wrongly-that his personal understanding of the term is both appropriate for an Egyptian context and implicitly shared by his colleagues.'7 To the evidence already adduced in refutation of the latter assumption of shared criteria may be added the common disagreement, encountered also in Classical and anthropological studies, whether oracles and divination are to be included among magical practices.'8 Certain scholars, most notably Budge among 14. Derchain 1965, vol. 1, p. ix. As an index of the effect of this reclassification, contrast the initial reac- tion of Derchain, just noted, with that of Hlerbin (1988, p. 95) concerning the rediscovery of the first half of Pap. Salt 825 in 1986: \"Tous des r6cits mythologiques.\" 15. For the magical properties of plants and the use of the wax figure, compare Birch 1863a, pp. 121 and 123-24 16. Borghouts 1974, pp. 15-16. 17. A similar observation is made by Lexa 1925, vol. 1, p. 13. His overview of suggested definitions is found on pp. 12-15. 18. Thus Preisendanz 1931, pp. XXXa-f), and (PGM XXXIa- c), includes oracular responses while the re-edition of this material by Betz (1986) excludes them as non-magical. A similar lack of unanimity is found in anthropological treatments; see the comments in Evans-Pritchard 1937, p. 8. This uncertainty follows a long tradition in Western thought; compare the lack of consensus among late Roman rulers regarding the distinction between divination and magic; discussed in MacMullen 1984, pp. 96 and 162, n. 28. oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE Egyptologists, have tended to lump together all manner of \"superstitious\" activities within the realm of \"magic.\" Thus not only oracles, but also calendars of lucky and unlucky days, dreams, horoscopes, and even animal worship have been rather incongruously associated as \"magical.\"''19 Objections yet more serious can be raised with regard to the assumption of the applicability of modern \"standardized\" dictionary definitions of magic to an ancient Egyptian context. A cursory survey of entries offered by just one such source will suffice to reveal the imprecision of modern parlance for ancient practice. Magic may be loosely defined as an endeavour through utterance of set words, or the performance of set acts, to control or bend the powers of the world to man's will.20 Such a definition places undue stress upon the role of man in the practice of magic, for as is seen below, it is primarily the gods who were felt to excel in the art. Indeed, most private magical texts require the assimilation of the practitioner to a deity in order to be successful. This sanctioning of the use of magic by the gods has profound implications for attempts to distinguish magic from religion. Magic is \"the use of means (as ceremonies, charms, spells) that are believed to have supernatural power to cause a supernatural being to produce or prevent a particular result (as rain, death, healing) considered not attainable by natural means.\"21 Within this definition a clear dichotomy is postulated between the supernatural methods of magic and a normative natural system of cause and effect. For the Egyptian, however, the activity which he designated \"magic\" was felt to be not supernatural but quintessentially a part of nature, being coeval with the creation of the natural order and used daily by the gods to maintain-not violate-that order.22 Magic is 'the art of producing unusual illusions of legerdemain.'23 No suggestion of trickery is ever implied in Egyptian terms for magic. Even where theatrical feats are described in literature, there is no indication that writer or audience 19. Budge 1901, pp. 206-34; so also in Wiedemann 1905, pp. 9-11. 20. Webster's, p. 1358. 21. Ibid., p. 1358. 22. The question of the natural status of magic is a complicated one, and is discussed below with regard to the term hk?. It must be admitted, however, that this power has been described as \"prenatural or supernatural\" even in the study which most clearly shows its fundamental importance in the maintenance of the natural created order. See te Velde 1970, especially contrast p. 176 \"prenatural\" and pp. 179-80 \"vital potential or creative energy\" (for the creation of the cosmos, the birth of children, the preservation of the sun, etc.). 23. Webster's, p. 1358. oi.uchicago.eduTOWARD A DEFINITION OF MAGIC disbelieved the possibility of such feats.24 In this, the Egyptian attitude is to be sharply distinguished from that of the Greco-Roman world in which the early terms for magic (yort ia) and magician (y6g) rapidly acquired the meanings \"fraud\" and \"huckster.\"25 This highly divergent attitude between even contemporary cultures should serve as a further warning of the general inapplicability of culturally or temporally bound definitions of magic. A similar need for greater precision in the terminology of magic has led anthropologists to repeated attempts at systematization. Social anthropology in particular has been highly influential in its formulations of magical theory, and as certain of its tenets have recently found acceptance in Egyptological literature,26 it is of some importance to examine its conclusions within an Egyptian context. Although it is beyond the scope of the present work to trace anthropological trends in any but a most cursory manner, even this brief overview will suffice to show the original parallelisms and present divergences of the two disciplines. Among the earliest and most persistently influential of anthropological theories of magic is that propounded by Sir James G. Frazer in his epochal The Golden Bough, which--despite its age-yet underlies all discussions of the subject in Egyptology. Like his Egyptological contemporaries, Frazer postulated an explicit dichotomy between religion and magic based on the pious or threatening attitude of the practitioner.27 His more distinctive contribution, however, is his definition of magic as sympathetic in nature, being divided into two categories: Ilomeopathic and Contagious. The former variety makes use of the belief that \"like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause,\" whereas the second operates on the principle that \"things which have once been in contact with each other continue to act on each other at a distance after physical contact has been severed.\"28 These principles could be readily combined in practice so that, for example, the manipulation of a voodoo doll would embody Homeopathic magic, while the inclusion of 24. Compare the miraculous events narrated in Pap. Westcar, Setna I, and Setna II, in pp. 125-51 (Setna I and Setna II). Further tales of magicians appear in Spiegelberg 1912 (Jug A for magician HI-, r and Jug B for magician Si-Wstr); idem 1917b (magician Hi-Hr); idem 1985 (magician Mry-R'). 25. Liddell, Scott, and Jones 1940, p. 356a. For the evolution of these terms see Tavenner 1916, pp. 1-5; Morton Smith 1978, pp. 1983. 26. Thus Evans-Pritchard's definition of \"witchcraft\" is adopted in Borghouts 1980, col. 1144: \"witchcraft (in the sense of evil influence by natural predisposition, without material manipulation).\" 27. Frazer 1910, pp. 52ff. oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE personal effects in the doll would represent Contagious magic. Nor were these categories limited to any particular magical act, culture, or era; all magical practice fell under one or both of these principles. So pervasive has this theory become outside of the social sciences that few authors since the publication of The Golden Bough have been able to resist the term \"sympathetic magic.\"29 Egyptology has yet to question its \"Frazerian\" attitude to the subject, and finds its perfect analog in the writings of B. Malinowski. Expanding upon the work of Frazer, Malinowski's Magic, Science and Religion upholds the religion/magic distinction, stresses the spoken spell, and insists that the primary focus of magic is man, not nature.30 The fundamental difficulties arising from the application of these criteria to Egyptian magic are detailed above. In the social sciences, the recognition of similar deficiencies has long since led to a re-evaluation of Frazer's theory, which has ultimately been challenged as much on the question of its usefulness as on its validity. By virtue of its reductionistic nature, it is incapable of distinguishing the differences in magical practices of one culture or era from another; for both Frazer and Malinowski the activities of magicians among the tribesmen of modern Australia are to be analyzed no differently from those among the sophisticated classes of antique Rome.31 Moreover, Frazer's theory fails to account for the remarkable persistence of the \"pathetic or ludicrous\" activities which he finds so devoid of truth or value.32 As a reaction to these deficiencies, newer theories have arisen stressing the functional role of magic, its inseparability from religion, and its value in individual societies. Chief among these theories is that of E. E. Evans-Pritchard. In attempting to avoid the indifference of general theories to cultural distinctions, Evans-Pritchard devised a new vocabulary for magical acts based exclusively upon and designed to represent a specific culture: the Zande of the Sudan.33 Concentrating primarily upon the harmful aspects of magic, he distinguished two sub-categories: witchcraft and sorcery. The latter designates the conscious performance of illicit or immoral magic by external methods such as spells or rites, while the former refers to a \"supposed psychic emanation\" from an internal bodily 29. See inter alia Gardiner 1922, p. 265b and Wilson 1952. p. 76. The term is far from obsolete in anthropological discussions as well. Thus Tambiah (1968, p. 194) feels compelled to dispute Frazer's interpretation, and it is still used with approval in Becker 1980, p. 20. 30. Malinowski 1948, pp. 19ff. and 50-71, especially p. 54: \"To the natives knowledge of magic means knowledge of spell\"; 56: \"It is not directed so much to nature as to man's relation to nature\"; and 68: \"It is always the affirmation of man's power to cause certain definite effects by a definite spell and rite.\" 31. Frazer 1910, p. 55 and Malinowski 1948, p. 51. 32. Frazer 1971, p. 127. 33. Evans-Pritchard 1937, pp. 8-12.10 oi.uchicago.eduTOWARD A DEFINITION OF MAGIC substance \"which is believed to cause injury to health and property.\"34 Like Frazer before him, Evans-Pritchard has spawned a school of magical theory, the \"structural-functionalist\" approach, which has dominated anthropological discussion since the appearance of Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande in 1937.35 Emphasizing the social processes which surround accusations of magic, he stressed the normative role of magical beliefs in sustaining the moral system and social codes of the Zande. Magic was to be viewed not as the \"great delusion\" of Frazer, but as an important force in sustaining a static society by providing an expedient explanation for misfortune.36 Despite a change in emphasis from a homeostatic to a confrontational model,37 the analysis of Evans-Pritchard has so far replaced that of Frazer in social anthropology that collections of essays devoted to \"witchcraft and sorcery\" presume the knowledge of his theories and terms, and a special memorial volume was dedicated to the thirtieth anniversary of his initial study of the Azande.38 In Egyptological literature, his terminology was introduced for the first time in 1980.39 It is particularly ironic that the culturally- specific terms selected by Evans-Pritchard should have become standardized for general application to dissimilar cultures, since he was among the first to advance a so-called \"emic\" approach \"whereby definitions, distinctions, and values are derived from the actors themselves rather than imposed on them by the observer.\"40 The dubious wisdom of generalizing Zande concepts was clearly evident to M. Douglas in her introduction to the 34. Evans-Pritchard 1937, p. 9 (mangu). 35. For a discussion of the critical importance of Evans-Pritchard's study on successive theorists, see Douglas 1970, pp. xiii-xxxviii. 36. Evans-Pritchard 1937, pp. 109-17. For an appraisal, see Douglas 1970, pp. xvi-xviii. 37. In reaction to the model of witchcraft accusations as an institution for the maintenance of social har- mony, recent theories have noted the increase of such accusations during periods of crisis and stressed their role as a challenge to authority when social relations are ill-defined. This interpretation has the advantage of accommodating both African and European data (Douglas 1970, pp. xviii-xxxvi). 38. Compare Marwick 1970, p. 19. For the memorial volume on the anniversary of the publication of Evans-Pritchard's study of the Azande, see Douglas 1970. 39. Borghouts 1980, col. 1144. The terminology enters Mesopotamian studies a decade earlier (Walters 1970-71). 40. Aune 1980, p. 1510, n. 4; see Evans-Pritchard 1937, pp. 4-5, especially p. 5: \"I have sought to provide it [scil. explanation] from the statements of Azande themselves ... Explanations, therefore, will be found embodied in my descriptive account and are not set forth independently of it.\" The term \"emic\" is discussed in Harris 1968, especially p. 571: \"Emic statements refer to logico-empirical systems whose phenomenal distinctions or 'things' are built up out of contrasts and discriminations significant, meaningful, real, accurate, or in some other fashion regarded as appropriate by the actors themselves.\"11 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE memorial volume for Evans-Pritchard, for she expressly declines to follow her colleagues in their use of terminology.41 The failure of more recent scholars to adhere to this \"emic\" approach is all the more surprising in the case of ancient Egypt, for the superimposed term \"witchcraft\" that was so crucial in Zande belief is without any Egyptian referent, save only the \"Evil Eye.\" Egyptian magic was definitely believed to reside in the body of the magician, but its use required the conscious manipulation of spell and rite.42 Egyptian magic thus cuts across the distinction inherent in its Zande counterpart. Moreover, neither the methodology of Evans-Pritchard nor that of his successors can be perfectly consonant with that of the Egyptologist. For the anthropologist, the malevolent sorcerer or witch is a fictitious creature, and all accusations of witchcraft are presumed false.43 The Egyptologist, on the other hand, is confronted by unmistakable archaeological and textual evidence of hostile magic, and must presume that accusations of magical practice could well be true. Although the efficacy of the practice may be subject to belief, its existence is not. Just as a simplistic adoption of anthropological terminology provides no deeper insights into the nature of Egyptian magic, so the present vogue for sociological terminology regarding magic in the fields of comparative religion and biblical study is equally ill at home within Egyptology. Seizing upon the early theories of Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss which stigmatize magic as anti-social and illegal behavior, Jonathan Z. Smith has recently argued that illegality is the \"one universal characteristic\" of magic.44 In response, David Aune has preferred to place magic within the framework of recent studies of social deviance, and considers magic to be \"universally regarded as a form of deviant behavior,\" where the latter term is defined as \"conduct that departs significantly from the norms set for people in their social statuses.\"45 Neither of these generalizations is satisfactory, for 41. Douglas 1970, p. xxxvi, n. 1. 42. Compare CT spells 30, 33-37, and passim. For discussion, see Borghouts 1980, col. 1140. 43. See Douglas 1970, p. xxxiv: \"Anthropologists have usually approached witchcraft from the point of view of the accuser, always assuming that the accusation is false. This has made it hard for us to interpret witchcraft confessions.\" This stance, noticeable also in the works of cultural historians, derives from a basic confusion between belief in sorcerers/witches and belief in the efficacy of sorcery/witchcraft. Admittedly, misfortunes have often been attributed to unknown and very likely fictitious witches, but this does not mean that individuals who practice witchcraft (and are therefore witches) do not exist. For a similar distinction between the witches of European folk belief and actual contemporary practitioners of sorcery, see Cohen 1970, pp. 11-12. 44. J. Z. Smith 1978, p. 192, following Brown 1970 and Morton Smith 1973, pp. 220-37. All of these the- ories ultimately derive from Roman law as extrapolated by Mauss 1972 and Durkheim 1965. pp. 57ff. 45. Aune 1980, p. 1515. The definition of social deviance is adopted by Aune from Merton and Nisbet 197 1, p. 824.12 oi.uchicago.eduTOWARD A DEFINITION OF MAGIC neither is correct. However magic may be defined, in Egypt the practice was in itself quite legal. Only one trial for sorcery is preserved from ancient Egypt, involving the use of wax figures in a plot against the throne, but the trial record is careful to state that the books of magic used by the prisoners came from the king's own collection.46 Sorcery against the king, not sorcery per se, was illegal. In other instances, kings, priests, and commoners used the same methods on a daily, normative, and legal basis. Thus King Amenophis II states on the Amada Stela (1. 5) that \"he made execration figures of his enemies and the Nine Bows (the traditional enemies of Egypt) likewise.\"47 Similar figures made by priests for foundation deposits are well known.48 Private individuals are specifically urged to use the same methods in the so-called \"Apophis Book\" (Papyrus BM 10188), making figures of the enemies of Re, Pharaoh, and \"all foes male and female whom your heart fears.\"49 The thematically similar \"Rite for Repelling the Angry One\" (Papyrus Louvre E 3129) is even more precise: \"If this spell is recited against any enemy of NN, evil will happen to him for 7 days.\"50 In both texts the reciter is said to participate in the destruction of divine, royal, and personal enemies with no distinction as to method or legality. It should be stressed that both texts were also performed in the daily liturgies of the chief temples of Amon-Re and Osiris, and are thus an integral part of the religious norm, and by no means constitute \"deviant\" behavior. So inextricably mixed do magic and religion seem in these instances that any formal distinction between them might well seem artificial and improper. Indeed, E. E. Evans-Pritchard has suggested that anthropology abandon the terms \"religion\" and \"magic,\" while the sociologist David Pocock, following Claude L6vi-Strauss, would dispose of the category of \"magic\" altogether.5' Is there any rationale for maintaining the concept \"magic\" in Egyptology, and can it be distinguished from religion? The answer to the first question must be yes, and the answer to the second forms the substance of this study. 46.

Selected by Coptic scribes to translate the Greek ccyEko, this term appears in Acts 8:9 to describe the \"magic\" of Simon Magus: 21K, \"to do 21K\" = ~ayEvW v.52 The clear equation of these terms is shown by the frequent parallel usage of the native P cIP2IK, \"a man who does 21K, magician\" with the Greek loan word M ,roc. Thus, the sorcery of Simon Magus mentioned above in Acts 8:9 (P 21K) is termed OC, \"the quality magic\" in Acts 8:11.53 in the Oration in Praise of Saint GeorgiOs Diosppwlis by Theodotos of Ancyra, the saint, when accused of being a magician (FTnl MZFOC), is berated for TCK METPC91P21K, \"your magic practices.\"54 Succinct explanation is offered in the Maryrdonm ofJGeorgis: TTY )M1 oY PCIE3P2IK This man is a magician (PCC1P21K) because by means of his magic (MdFl ) he set demons before us.55 As an explanation of the foreign term, the words are conjoined in the Coptic Ms. 40, 50 of the Pierpont Library: MD~roC NPC'P?1K, \"a magician-NrOC.\"56 In the form PEcP2IK, the word translates other Greek terms for \"magician\" as well, including pappaK6;, \"sorcerer\" in Deuteronomy 18: 10, and Fxoi6O;, \"enchanter\" in Daniel 4:4.57 52.

In a similar fashion, Father Dios is called \"this magician\" (TICI MJrOC) because of his successful prediction of the future (Rossi 1893. p. 88, col. a, 11. 6-7 [folio LIIJ). Saint Victor is denounced by his father for conjuring with the Christians: \"Do you not know that 1 have already learned that you are among them receiving instruction to practice magic (M 1rrlx) in this name Jesus\" (Budge 1977a, pp. 8 [text] and 260 [translation]). In contrast, Saint Anthony states that the casting out of demons by Christian practice is anti-magical, though pagan exorcisms constitute magic. See Garitte 1949, p. 84. \u00a7\u00a778--79 (Anthony challenging pagans): \"And in the place in which there is the sign of the cross, magic (M~rl?.) is powerless, and sorcery (MNTpE'fT P6) is without effect.

(\"prophets of Heka\").62 References multiply in the late Fifth and early Sixth Dynasties, with the god's name compounded with that of the reigning king in the name of funerary estates: desires that Teti live\").63 Only two of these estates can be assigned geographic locations, but the presence of both \"Heka satisfies Unis\" and \"Heka satisfies Teti\" in the third Lower Egyptian nome may indicate a local cult of the god.64The first theological 58.

It is not Pepi who says this against you, 0 gods; it is Magic who says this against you, 0 gods. This Mery-Re is bound for the mound containing Magic.66 Typical of texts which concern Heka from all periods, these spells are inconsistent regarding the inclusion of a divine determinative in the orthography of the word Hk:to distinguish the god, \"Magician,\" from the title, \"magician,\" or the concept, \"magic.\"67 So enmeshed are god and concept that little distinction is made between them in Egyptian writings.68 65.

Spell 261, a charm \"To Become the God Heka,\" constitutes the longest theological exposition on magic, placed in the mouth of the deity himself. Within the spell, Heka addresses the gods in the presence of the creator and declares his origin and powers. O noble ones who are before the Lord of the universe (\"the All\"),69 behold, I have come before you. Respect me in accordance with what you know. I am he whom the Unique Lord made before two things (\"duality\") had yet come into being in this land by his sending forth his unique eye when he was alone, by the going forth from his mouth ... when he put tlu (\"Logos\") upon his mouth. 1 am indeed the son of Him wio gave birth to the universe (\"the All\"), who was born before his mother yet existed. I am the protection of that which the Unique Lord has ordained. I amn he who caused the Ennead to live ... I have seated myself, O bulls of heaven, in this my great dignity as Lord of kas, heir of Re-Atum. I have come that I might take my seat and that I might receive my dignity, for to me belonged the universe before you gods had yet come into being. Descend, you who have come in the end. I am HIeka.70 The role of Heka thus outlined presents most of the salient features of this god and the concept he embodies. First of the creations of Re-Atum, Heka appears before the emanation of Hu (the creative word or \"Logos\") from the mouth of the creator. This \"authoritative utterance\" he infuses with his magic vitality, thereby bringing the gods and the cosmos into existence. The intimate association of magic and word is here given ontological explanation; magic resides in the word itself.71 Described as a son of the creator, Heka is in actuality the hypostasis of the creator's own power which begets the natural order. This primordial generative aspect of Heka is further stressed in Coffin Texts spell 648: His powers put fear into the gods who came into being after him, his myriad of spirits is within his mouth. It was Heka who came into being of himself, at seeing whom the gods rejoiced, and through the sweet savor of whom the gods live, who created the mountains and knit the firmament together.72 69. The word tm (de Buck 1947, pp. 382b and 384d) has been translated by scholars as either \"the universe\" or the god, \"Atum,\" but even in the former case a clear pun would be intended on the name of Alum who is expressly mentioned as the father of Heka (ibid., p. 388c). For the various translations of this spell, see Gardiner 1915, p. 254; Faulkner 1973, pp. 199-2(00; and te Velde 1970, p. 180. 70. For the text, see de Buck 1947, pp. 382-89. 71.

In the seventh hour of the book \"What is in the underworld\" (Amduat), Re confronts and defeats his adversary Apophis/Apep, the serpent of chaos, by virtue of the magic (iik) of Isis and the \"Elder Magician\" (1.k: szsw).76 The qualification of Heka as 73. \"He (the sin god Re) traverses the sky without wearying until the new lay comes. when the arms of his maje 7ty (Re), as 'Great of Magic,' form again the two heavens\"; Drioton 1926, p. 18.

Although Hornung would identify the \"Elder Magician\" as an epithet of Seth, te Velde has shown that the god Heka is preferable. Compare Homung 1963, vol. 2, pp. 131ff. and te Velde 1970, pp. 177-78. Hornung's interpretation is based on a passage in the Sphinx Stela of Tuthmosis IV, which follows a mention of Seth by one of HkI smsw. The text in Helck 1955b, p. 1542, 1. 3, reads as follows: \u00a9 y (original direction reversed), and -O was understood by Homung as an error for .However, the sign following the Seth animal has been re-edited by Zivie to read Dwlw ( ; see Zivie 1976, pp. 128 and 140, n. cc). There is thus no interrelationship between Seth and Hk-smnsw, but rather a list of independent gods, as recognized already by Kees (1930). Most recently, Hornung's interpretation has been restated in Cannuyer 1985, pp. 83-84, who recopies the critical sign as an unambiguous writing of Hkl: .Because of the general disagreement on the form of this hieroglyph, I personally inspected the Sphinx Stela on June 24, 1986 in the company of Dr. Ann Roth with the assistance of Dr. Ahmed Moussa of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. The sign (in line 7) is undamaged, unaltered, and absolutely clear: .Cannuyer's reading is thus completely excluded, and although the sign does not show the \"kidney-bean\" shape often attested for Dww, the form is well within the range of \"ovals\" used to write the god's name at Giza. Only the raised and slanted positioning of the \"oval\" above its standard on the Sphinx Stela distinguishes the writings. Compare S. Hassan 1941, pl. 37 (= p. 117): .The Sphinx Stela may thus provide further evidence for the existence of a local cult of Dww in the vicinity (Kees 1980, p. 109 [near Heliopolis?]; denied by Helck 1954, p. 37). 78. This transfer of power from single deity to general divine property finds its inverse development in the evolution of wr(.t)-hk?.w (\"Great of Magic\") from a common divine epithet to a specific divine personification as a protective cobra goddess. Thus, on a \"magical wand\" from the New Kingdom in the collection of University College London, the relation between Hu (\"Logos\") and Heka is transformed: \"Hu, son of the kas of She-who-is-Great-of-Magic\" (Petrie 1974, p. 58 [\u00a7112, no. 318] and pl. 51). For the epithet 1976. See also nn. 60, 68, and 73, above, and n. 298, below. Confusion with this cobra deity may account for the depiction of Heka as female in a traditional barque scene on a late coffin in Maspero, Gauthier, and Bayoumi 1939, p. 140 (n. 3) and pl. XLIII (top). Though Nebe (1986, col. 1223, n. 32) denies the independent existence of this goddess in the Late Period, see Norman de Garis Davies 1953, p. 4 and pl. 4 (Sanctuary, third register, right end): Wr.t-Hk. t n ?bt(w), \"She who is 'Great-of-Magic' of Abydos\"; and Naville 1892, p. 19 and pl. 7 (right of \u00a718): [Wr.t]-Hkt.

This defensive aspect of magic may thus bc used imitatively-and legitimately-by other deities (such as Isis) and even mankind to preserve existence and destroy enemies. The Tenth Dynasty \"Instructiho s for King Merikare\" are explicit in their allotment to mankind of the defensive pout ers of magic.

Even the gods could be threatened by this force which they are said to fear. Ptolemaic offering rituals include a purifying incantation against the poisoning of their food by sorcery.85 The demon Apophis, who is destroyed by ik' (and Heka), nonetheless possesses his own, albeit ineffectual hlk: which he marshals against Re: good to him; he who does evil, He does the like to him.\" Drioton interprets this as a warning against a perceived scribal tendency to subordinate all religion to the practice of magic (1928, p. 54), and his interpretation is modified in Traunecker 1983, pp. 76-77, where the text is interpreted to mean that only the righteous pilgrim will be cured by the statue's magical spells. The discussion of righteousness refers not to the pilgrims, however, but to the statue's donor. The statue's praise of Re is made only after an appeal to visitors to praise the donor as a \"noble spirit in her town, who did what the heart of her god desired\" ( s.t m niw.t s it' )b t ntr- s). The concluding pious remarks about Re seem designed to bolster this assertion of the donor's piety, and thus assure the desired gesture oi favor from temple visitors-which was the underlying reason for the statue's erection. No suggestion of hostility to \"magic\" should be implied-especially on a statue which would have been covered in \"magical\" formulae and intended (by the donor!) to provide \"magical\" aid to those suffering from scorpion and snake bite. On the contrary, it is the erection of the curing statue with its \"magical\" formula that is praised here as that which \"the heart of her god desired,\" and which proves the donor worthy of being a \"noble soul of her town.\" For her benefaction she expects to receive praise from the temple visitors, and blessings from Re who rewards good deeds with goodness. Drioton (1927b) had previously sought to find evidence of a conflict between cult and magic within a spell on a similar Ptolemaic statue base in the Indjandjian collection. As with the Louvre text, however, the supposed conflict derives from a textual misinterpretation. A standard threat to halt cult offerings if the poison continues to circulate is mistranslated as a declaration of the relative ineffectiveness of cultic versus magical healing. 82.

In the \"Book of the Heavenly Cow,\" he withdraws into the heavens in flight from magicians \"who act as they desire against the entire land using the magic that is in their bodies.\"\"87 Similarly, in the tale of \"Isis and the Name of Re,\" he refuses to divulge his true name since \"1 hid it in my body when I was born to prevent the power of any male or female magician coming to be against me.\"88 One theological response to such fears was to insist on the deity's immunity to hostile magic. In the Coffin Texts, Shu declares: I do not obey Magic, for i came into being before him.89 At Medamud, the local divine bull is praised in similar terms: There is no prescription against him in the collections of writings. There is no magic against him in the written word.90 Such statements find their counterpart in the Hellenistic aretalogies of Isis, who proclaimed \"I overcome Fate; Fate obeys me.\"91 Despite these claims to immunity, threats against the gods, the course of the solar bark, and even the existence of creation are commonplace in preserved Egyptian magical spells, reflecting a belief in the inexorable power of hk: to which both gods and men are subject.92 86.

Its appearance is not \"prenatural,\" but marks the beginning of \"nature.\"94 Heka has not only given life to the gods (Coffin Texts spell 261); he gives life to them (Coffin Texts spell 641). If Heka is immanent in the cosmos it is because the creating divinity is immanent in him. In \"The Book of the Heavenly Cow\" Re states this relationship unambiguously. Discussing spells (r;.w), them. As for him who ingests (\"knows\") them, there am I.95 The association of Heka and Re is further defined in the \"ba-theology\" of the same text, in which Re declares Magic to be his \"external manifestation\" or ba-spirit.96 I am the one who made heaven and who established [it] in order to place the bas of the gods within it. I shall be with them for eternity which time begets. My ha is Magic (hk:w). It is older than it (scil. \"time\") ... The ha of Re is in Magic (hkw) throughout the entire land.97 The text continues with a ritual to be said by a man \"that he might make his protection by magic.\" 93.

Borghouts' 1980 attempt (cols. I 139-40), to equate Egyptian and Zande conceptions is discussed above, pp. I11-12. Contrary to the statements of Borghouts, loc. cit., magic in Egypt is viewed always as a force (like \"life\" or \"strength\") which is consumed and which permeates the body, but never as a tangible, material \"substance\" (like Zande mangu). The same objections apply of Sauneron 1962b, pp. 260-61. Borghouts (1987a, p. 35) now repeats his opinion with reference to magic being eaten, smelled, etc. Magical power may certainly be made to permeate a tangible object and thus be manipulated in these ways (see Chapter 3, below), but this does not mean that magic is itself inherently tangible. 94. The term \"prenatural\" is te Velde's (1970, p. 176). In any case, Egyptian concepts of \"nature\" do not correspond to Western counterparts; cf. the term for \"all, totality,\" nit iwtt, \"that which is and that which is not\" (Wb 2: 354/10). 95.

On your face, enemy of Re! I am his ha, the Magician (Hkw).98 Elsewhere, Re may be provided with as many as seven bas, but even there may be found b] Hk?, \"the ba, Heka.\"99 In a Berlin hymn which assigns the role of creator to Ptah, Heka correspondingly appears as the ba of that deity: Everyone trembles when his ba comes into being, Magic (tik) who has power over the gods.100 In later periods this relationship is expressed differently, with Heka designated as the ka-spirit (\"double, vital essence\") of Re. Thus, in Papyrus BM 10188 (col. 27/5-6), the sun god declares: k ? y pw hk~w, \"Magic is my ka.\"lOl This conception seems to have become popular, and was by no means restricted to priestly speculation, for the title \"ka of Re\" accompanies several depictions of the god on the publicly displayed \"healing statue\" of Djedhor.'02 On the walls of Dendera, Edfu, Kom Ombo, and Philae, Heka appears as one of the fourteen kas of Re.103 The accompanying inscriptions, though \"conventional,\" nevertheless convey clearly the role of the god in later theology.104 Presented to Hathor of Dendera by the king, Heka arrives \"bearing his spells (?hw) and his magic (/tk:) mingled in his body. His words are efficacious, his dignity flourishes in the hearts of men.\"105 Significantly, Hathor receives Heka in her quality of \"Great of Magic among the gods.\"'06 At Edfu, the king escorts before Horus \"Heka who performs magic (/k?), with his magic spread out before you. He has made your magic. He has caused that the respect of you and the fear of you be mingled in every body.\"'17 As in the Coffin Texts 98. Hornung ibid., pp. 27 and 47 (11. 287-95). 99.

Heka's association with the ka derives from this earlier period, however, for in Coffin Texts spell 261 Heka styles himself \"Lord of kas,\" and in spell 648 it is stressed that \"his myriad of ka-spirits is within his mouth.\" In fact, his name itself may indicate the origin of the relationship. Although later theorists at Esna derived his name by \"folk etymology\" from h(>.t)-k, (.t), \"first work\" in reference to his preeminent position in the order of creation, te Velde has suggested that the name stems from hwi-k,, \"He who consecrates (literally \"strikes\") the ka.\"1\u00b08 Seeming confirmation of this etymology is found in a variant of Coffin Texts spell 261, which states that Heka (here identified with the deceased) hwi k;.w4f, \"consecrates his (scil. the creator deity's) kas.\"109 Illustrations of this consecration are found in the royal birth scenes of the New Kingdom and later in which Heka is shown presenting the new-born king and his ka to their creator.10 Similarly, at Edfu the god Shu is said to dedicate (hwi) every good thing to Atum, \"since he has become Heka.\"11 Thus may be explained the method of Heka's effectiveness. At the stroke of a word, Magic penetrates the ka or \"vital essence\" of any element in creation and invests it with power, either generative or destructive. The notion of power is central to the role of Heka, and becomes the very emblem of his name. Attested as early as the Twentieth Dynasty, the sign -w or -(phty), meaning \"strength/power,\" frequently replaces the phonetic spellings of the god's name.112 Although an alternate emblem has been suggested for 108. For the Esna etymology, see Sauneron 1962b, p. 212. For te Velde's suggestion, see 1970, pp. 179-80. 109. De Buck 1947, 385c. 33-34, prefers to translate hwi as \"drive\" to avoid nuances of creative action by Heka. 110. For the role of Heka in the divine birth of the king, see Brunner 1986, pp. 139 (= pl. 13) and 161 (= pl. 15); Naville 1896, vol. 2, pls. 53 (= Brunner, pl. 18) and 55 (= Brunner, pl. 19); Gardiner 1915, pp. 260-61; and te Velde 1970, pp. 178-79. His role is equally prominent in the jubilee rituals of royal rebirth (Uphill 1965, pp. 370 and 376). The traditional prominence of \"magic\" was retained even by the iconoclastic Akhenaton; see the jubilee hymn in Spalinger 1988: \"Hail to you O king Neferkheprure ... who has seized the magic of Horus\" (col. 2, Spalinger's translation ibid., p. 30, ignores the writing of \"Horus\" visible in fig. 16). In later periods, Heka has the same function in the derivative scenes of the birth chapels (\"mammisis\") which depict the birth of the child deity of the local triad (Daumas 1958, pp. 464-65 and 472-76 and Junker pp. 104-07).

The writing may be attested as early as the Middle Kingdom in a personal name Hk ?(?) (Ranke 1935, p. 256, no. 22 [S. Louvre C 45]).

As a recipient of fields, he appears on donation stelae from Kom Firin and Kom el-Hisn, and his name has been found on a block from Amria near lake Mareotis.119 It is perhaps significant that this is the very region in which Old Kingdom funerary estates were dedicated to the god.120 Personal names compounded with Heka proliferate in the Greco-Roman periods, Heka is one of the chief deities at Esna. His festival of Hathor 22 was marked by a procession of the god's image through the fields to encourage growth after the inundation, with a triumphal return as a victorious king.'22 Much has been made of Heka's appearance within differing local triads, being equated with Nefertum or Geb, and made the son of Ptah, Khnum-Re, or Sobek.123 This has even been considered by te Velde and Kikosy to indicate a lessening of his status, a trivializing of his position into that of the \"ordinary\" child divinity.124 Nonetheless, in each of his various cult sites, and despite varying identifications with local gods, Heka's function remains consistent. Wherever Heka is venerated, he is represented as the eldest child of the creating divinity. At Heliopolis this creator is Re-Atum, at Memphis, Ptah, in the west Delta, Sobek-Re, and at Esna, Khnum-Re. Far from being demoted, the theology of Heka has so far permeated local cults that he has supplanted the original younger members of regional triads. Thus may he appear as tlk-p-hrd, \"Heka the child\" with the consorts of these local creators (Sakhmet, Neith, Tefnut), or seated upon an opening lotus as the solar infant \"who opens his two eyes that the two lands might see.\"125 119. See Spiegelberg 2; and Kees 1930. At Armant, Heka the child is said to \"exact tribute from the land of Libya (Tm/i)\" (Lepsius 1972-73, Abteilung IV, pl. 63c [second seated child god from left]). 120.

George MacDonald 1981, p. 131 oi.uchicago.edu30 THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE ;hw Having established that magic-as hk -constitutes a pivotal, and by no means \"artificial\" category in Egyptian thought,'28 we must consider related phrases and synonyms in order to discover the perceived range and nature of this force. Among the most important of these associated terms is :hw, i, , surviving into Old Coptic as H, and translated previously (p. 24) in a Ptolemaic text from Dendera as \"spells.\"129 The verb, >h, the root of this term, may mean either \"to he effective\" or \"to he bright,\" and derivatives of both nuances are common.130 In the case of }hw, \"spells,\" the literal meaning is presumably \"effective things,\" but a pun on the alternate meaning \"bright\" may be found in the \"Book of Amduat,\" in which it is said: hII) U ntd w -.l SSi/) h k4.4,in May your words occur; may your magic shine.131 A case has recently been made by Borghouts for a sharp delineation in meaning between hk: and :hw, with the latter alone being a \"self-sufficient creative power.\"132 Restricted to the divine sphere, >hww \"may substitute another element (even a 'void') and thus have an apotropaic function too.\"133 In contrastIk: \"only blots out impediments to a desired result, and in selectively doing so may arrive at the same results as Borghouts' theory derives directly from the comments of Chabas in 1868, in which he distinguished 'iw}, \"benefaction\" (bonue\") from other magical notions of \"repelling\" in what 128.

This argument what actually happens is,30 oi.uchicago.eduTHE VOCABULARY OF MAGIC has since become known as the \"Standard Text A\" of the stelae of Horus-on-the- crocodiles.135 These proposed distinctions are readily proved false.

Alternatively, Isis' use of it may signify that she wishes to prevent anything from coming between herself and the vision she wishes to call up with Seth. In other words, hik;.w forms the protective 'aura' around her changing appearances. These are brought about by her creative act which in theological terms would he based on l1iw. But for all its mythological consistency, this is not a theological text but a folk-tale. To expect subtleties of this kind is perhaps asking a bit too much.\" Borghouts' analysis has several deficiencies: it implies-wrongly--that i, is not a theological term, it devalues the common use of this force by the gods (especially Isis), it assumes that the unmentioned :1guw must play a role in the act of creative magic; and it dismisses the example as aberrant because of \"the social dimension of this terminology.\" The example is by no means :aberrant, and is paralleled in Pap.

Of Apep it is said: nn ;th' nI ih -k t'w (= r) s.t f The spells of your heart are not in their place (i.e., \"not right, functioning\").156 In the Metternich Stela, Isis conjoins the terms in what may allude to the best explanation of their ultimate relationship: the goddess, the possessor of magic, who performs magic, effective of speech, excellent of words.157 Expressing the notion of \"effectiveness,\" th serves as an attribute of magical speech; as the noun :hw, it embodies that attribute in a literary synonym for the basic term /.k>. The quality of \"effectiveness\" is thus seen as fundamental to magic, and the equation is often 153. The term \"deceptive\" is that of Borghouts 1980, col. 1139.

This almost exclusive interest in the spoken and written spell is quite understandable in view of the many Egyptian statements which also stress this aspect of hk?'. Thus Thoth, the god of writing, is regularly qualified as \"excellent of magic\" (mni hk:) in his capacity as \"Lord of hieroglyphs\" (nb mdw-ntr).16 Similarly, hk? may be directly identified with the spoken word. Spells are specifically labeled as \"god's words\" (mdw-ntr),161 and in the \"Apophis Book,\" the reciter warns the demon: \"Retire, turn back at this magic which has come forth from my mouth for Pharaoh!\"162 Depictions of the god Heka are also instructive. As a ka of Re, he is described at Dendera as \"excellent of words,\" a quality which he bestows upon the local deity Hathor, who is in consequence 158. For examples, see below, nn. 202 and 203. The translation of qi as \"effective\" is certain in these standard recommendations; compare the Demotic equivalent using ir w, \"to be valuable/useful/ effective\" in the London and Leiden Magical Pap., col. 29/30: \"It is effective for a youth, and it is effective for you yourself alone\"; in Griffith and Thompson 1904, pp. 168-69. The understanding of ?h as a qualifying synonym of the basic notion of hk' obviates the awkward dichotomy posed between the terms by Borghouts, and readily explains both their parallel usage and the rarer occurrence of ?f. Thus one must not infer too much from the absence of the latter term, contra Borghouts 1987a, pp. 32-33 (regarding \"The Instructions for King Merikare,\" see above, n. 79). 159. For these creation myths, see above, n. 73. 160. Faulkner 1933, p. 93 and 1938, p. 53. The relation of Thoth to magic is discussed in detail in Boylan 1979, pp. 124-35.

The theme of the author is the superiority of written literature as a memorial in preference to children and tombs. In verso 3, 1. 7-11, he develops this theme with reference to prophecy: The sages who prophesied (sr) ill fortune, that which came forth from their mouths happened, being found in statements written in their books ... They concealed their magic (hk:w) from the entire world, (though) read in a book of instruction. They are gone; their name is forgotten. It is writing which causes them to be remembered.168 Since the works of the sages mentioned in this passage are known, and contain nothing which could be considered spells or enchantments, the term \"magic\" (/kw) must refer to the written prophecies themselves, or to the notion of \"artistic creativity\" in the very act of literary composition.169 This link with writing is apparent even in the signs which compose hk:. At Philae, the formation of Heka's name with multiple writing determinatives parallels his depiction both here and at Edfu: , and it should not be forgotten that the word hk i itself is often spelled with the so-called \"man-with-hand-to-mouth\" determinative ( ) indicating speech.170 Nonetheless, speech alone cannot be considered the totality of hk:. A variation in the \"Apophis Book\" on the frequent idiom _Id m hk, \"say as magic\" adds ift ?pp 1w (= r) sd.t, \"while putting Apep on the fire.\"'7' The ritual as well as the spell is crucial for the success of magic. Moreover, in the \"Apophis Book\" it is specified that the fire must be of bryony (,s:tw).172 Specific ingredients, by virtue of inner properties, are equally essential. 168. Gardiner 1935, vol. 1. p. 39 and vol. 2, pl. 19. Overlooked by the works cited above, in n. 59, this passage is obliquely discussed with relation to magic in Posener 1956, pp. 33-35. Posener is concerned only with the role of one author, Neferty, as a lector priest, and does not mention the presence of hk.: in the text. This example of sr iy.t (with evil determinative) cannot be solar, and was missed by Graefe 1979 (see the preceding n. 167). 169. For \"artistic creativity\" as a function of hk , see above. pp. 31-32 and n. 142. 170. For Heka at Philae, see Diumichen 1981, pl. 162 (= Porter and Moss 1939, p. 215) and Junker 1958, pp. 95-96. 98, and 100 (= Dilmichen 1981, pl. 162). As at Edfu, Hleka is shown bearing writing determinatives on his tray. For the spelling of /k', see Wh 3: 175-77. 171. Papyrus BM 10188, col. 23/1, in Faulkner 1933, p. 45 and 1937b, p. 168.

Bryony is similarly required in the anti-Apep ritual at Esna (Sauneron 1962b, p. 25). See also the rite in Schott 1956, p. 185. An oblique reference to this usage is perhaps to be found in CT spell 311 (de Buck 1951, p. 67). For /jstw as bryony, see Dawson 1934, p. 45. The poisonous, acrid nature of the plant accounts for its use here.38 oi.uchicago.eduTHE VOCABULARY OF MAGIC 3 A practical application of this magic by substance is found in Papyrus Berlin P. 8769, a Demotic text of Roman date used for amulets or dream-interpretation.'73 Corresponding to each variety of stone mentioned is a prediction for its possessor: Y' ni r'.t r Pr- ' ir n fsh-nfr Prs f ikri- Stone of rn-s: h~w sulfide (galena)-His life will be pleasant after great misfortune.'76 my s i w f ii Ill) t nit i i 'w, f / i shrn.t wi nitws by Alabaster-He will be the possessor of favor; he will know (sexually) a woman who has a husband.177 Perhaps nowhere is this \"doctrine\" of properties better explained than in Papyrus Salt 825, whose disputed \"magical\" nature is mentioned above (pp. 6-7). Horus cried. The water fell from his eye to the earth and it grew. That is how dry myrrh came to be. Geb was sad on account of it. Blood fell from his nose to the ground and it grew. That is how pines came to be and resins came to be from their fluid. Then Shu and Tefnut cried exceedingly. The water from their eyes fell to the ground and it grew. That is how incense came to be.'78 These materials-myrrh, resin, and incense-are then used in the preparation of a figure of the god Osiris, imparting to it their divine nature.'79 Directly descended from this concept of properties is the \"plant aretalogy\" in POM IV, 11. 2967-3006, which professes to describe an Egyptian ritual for harvesting plants for ceremonial use.18t0 Although written in Greek 173. Spiegelberg ( 1902, p. 29 [discussion without transliteration or translationJ and pl. 98) takes it to be an anmulet papyrus. The suggestion that it was used for dream interpretation was made by von Gefele (1904, p. 120). 174. Column 1/5. 175. Column 1/8. 176. Column 2/2. 177. Column 2/4; Cot. 1/9-10: hf rrnm :, \"Alabaster-Don't let him go after a woman who has a husband; lie is not allowed to stand with her.\" Form ni-s;>, cf. iyrm-s? in Smither 1941, pp. 131-32.39 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE (with the substitution of Greek equivalents for certain Egyptian deities), the stated Egyptian origin of the ritual is not in doubt, and a comparison with Papyrus Salt 825 is striking. Having purified the chosen herb with pine resin and incense, the practitioner invokes it as follows: ... You are the dew of all the gods, you are the heart of Hermes (= Thoth), you are the seed of the primordial gods, you are the eye of Helios (= Re) ... your flowers are the Eye of Horus, your seed is Pan's (= Min's) seed ...181 As in Papyrus Salt 825, the plant is equated with the fluid or body of a deity (or deities) from whom it derives its efficacy: \"Your roots come from the depths, but your powers are in the heart of Hermes (= Thoth).\"'82 It is this indwelling divine power that the magician hopes to tap. Both preceding and following the invocation (iKn ri tg) in PGM IV is the pp&)tc, or rite, which forms the final element in magical \"practice,\" unifying spell and matter. 183 Into these three aspects-magic by word, by rite, or by material-may also be divided most native Egyptian terminology (hieroglyphic/hieratic, Demotic, and Coptic) associated with the art of hk?. Not surprisingly, the terms indicating magic by speech are particularly numerous, words for \"spell\" being of necessity direct expressions of speech. Thus such general terms as mndw, ~, \"word\"; r>, I, \"speech\"; and dd, , \"statement\" often assume magical connotations, exemplified by their direct juxtaposition with ik?w and h in \"Text A\" of the Horus cippi: = .y ?w .k dd.n ,iy m dd k Ih.n .y m rnt,' k n.n t y m ndw k (var. d = k) qm .n k m ik:w pwy imy r: k 181. Preisendanz 1928, 11. 2982-85 and 2994-96. The technique of listing identifications between divine and human (or, as here, plant) body parts is a commonplace in all Egyptian funerary, magical, and religious literature. The basic study on this technique of \"lists\" is Massart 1959. Compare Dawson 1931, pp. 26-27 (\"Protection of Parts of the Body by 1970, p. Piankoff 1964, pp. 38-39). Examples in the Coffin Texts alone include spells 280, 292, 531, 682, 705, 761, 822, 945, 953, and 979. The implications of this technique have been misinterpreted as an indication that the Egyptians did not view the body systematically, but only as a \"Gliederpuppe,\" or collection of independent limbs to be treated independently (Ritner 1989c, critique of Brunner-Traut 1988). 182. Preisendanz 1928, 2992-94). 183. In contrast, Festugibre 1932, pp. 284-89, divides magical practice in the PGM into invocation and rite only, subordinating the role of indwelling \"properties.\" For Festugi.re, (pp. 294-303) the \"power\" of such objects derives from the invocations and rites that infuse the materials with force (&6vatt;) and spirit (xve :t). Such power is, however, often declared to be pre-existent and \"natural\" in specific objects and need not be implanted by the magician. Instruments are certainly \"charged\" by rite and spell, but they are also strengthened by the application of innately divine material.40 oi.uchicago.eduTHE VOCABULARY OF MAGIC I have spoken (dd) by means of your spell (r?), I have recited (id) by means of your magic (hlkw), I have spoken (dd) by means of your statement (dd), I have made spells (:1t) by means of your spells (:'lw), I have enchanted (in) by means of your words (mdw) (var. \"recitation,\" .d) which you created by means of this magic (hk:w) which is in your mouth.184 Here the notions expressed by dd, r'. ,d, i, n, and mdw are not only paralleled by hk w, but are said to derive directly from the ltk' in the god's mouth. Regarding dd and mdw, little more need be said, their magical nature being discussed above in reference to the proficiency in sorcery of Isis and Thoth. It should be noted, however, that conjoined as dd mdw, , \"words to be said\" (> \"to recite magic\") the terms conclude most magical recitations, serving to introduce the directions for the accompanying rite. Despite this fixed idiomatic usage, the phrase is by no means limited to purely \"magical\" practice (as traditionally defined), and appears commonly as the introduction to both ritual responses by deities on temple walls and to cultic recitation.185 It is perhaps significant that this simple phrase, often encountered yet rarely analyzed, occurs in just those environ- ments in which the traditional distinction between magic and religion is the most tenuous. Similar in usage is ri-, < i, derived from the word for \"mouth\" and employed both as a general term for \"spell\" and as a section heading \"chapter\" for temple and funerary ritual recitation. Thus a god may be praised for \"his spells of magic\" (r.wnfn k?);186 a lector priest who reads the temple liturgy boasts that he \"knows his spell\" (rh r?-f);187 temple cult may include \"spells incense\" (r: n sntr),'88 the temple library of Edfu describes its 184. Though this is the commonly accepted translation, an often ignored variant in a Ramesside papyrus in Vienna clearly interprets the otherwise ambiguous sdrdm.n -f- forms as augmented imperatives (r/i-sdm) plus dative (n y): \"Hail to you Horus, come forth from Osiris, born of Isis, recite (r-Jd) for me by means of your magic, speak (i-dd) for me by means of [your statement]\" (von Bergmann 1886, p. vii and pl. V, I. 3). The augmented imperatives are not noted by von Bergmann or Borghouts (1978, p. 84 [no. 123J). For the basic bibliography, see n. 144, above. 185. See Wb 5: 625-26.

See Gardiner 1952, p. 16 and pl. 6 (1. 69). This use of r? clearly implies ritual action as well as speech.41 oi.uchicago.edu42 THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE holdings as books, instructions, laws, and \"Chapters for averting the Evil Eye\" (rw nw lsf ir-bn.t);189 literature is divided offering ritual contrasts \"glorifications\" (s.w) with \"spells\" (r.w).'9' It is obvious, however, that the distinction between \"chapters\" and \"spells\" is an entirely artificial one not reflected in the Egyptian term. Both the Edfu and mortuary \"chapters\" could as easily-and more properly-be translated \"spells.\" As with dd rndw, the usage of r> is restricted to ritual and magical contexts.192 Secular literature does not use the term to mark section divisions. The only exception to this distinction in secular and ritual terminology seems to be the word hw.t, , \"stanza\" (literally \"house\"), which is used in poetry as well as in the Pyramid Texts and the \"Apophis Ritual\" of Papyrus BM 10188.193 Closely MH,\"spell\").'94 The literal meaning of the first phrase, \"(what-is-)on-thc-mouth,\" is fully functional and often gives rise to ambiguity in translation. Thus such common expressions as 4zw tp-i-k and hk; tp- r. : k may be rendered as either \"spells/magic of your utterances\" or \"spells/magic on your 189. See Chassinat 1928, p. 351 (text); H. Brugsch 1871, p. 44 (translation); and idem 156. In 1871, Brugsch translates ir-bw.t as \"that which brings bad luck\"; in 1891. he suggests that this is a medical text. A simpler explanation is to take ir-b'r.t as a writing of ir.W-bi. \"Evil Eye\"; cf. Wb 1: 107/5. This interpretation is now confirmed by the publication of a chapel at Dendera provided with carved extracts from this book, in which Thoth protects the temple from the \"Evil Eye\" (Cauville 1989, pp. 51-56).

The term also appears in Demotic in the oracular \"Demotic Chronicle,\" 4 mouth.\" For examples, see above, p. 33. Similarly, the second term hm.t-r?, literally \"craft of the mouth,\" is also subject to two interpretations, being used most commonly to mean simply \"etc.\"195 Associated with dd, rndw, and r in the cippus text above are the terms &niand &. Regularly translated \"to enchant, conjure, or exorcise,\" Sni, , derives from an extended use of a common verb meaning \"to ask\" or \"to recite.\"196 Given the identical writing of the two verbs, there seems no reason to postulate differing verbal stems, and Anthes may be correct in tracing the root to the word Thi, \"to bind\" or \"to of si itself include and the Late Egyptian variant snty, \"to conjure.\"'98 The frequently apotropaic usage of the term is marked. Thus, within at least five passages in the \"Apophis Book,\" Apep and his confederates are \"exorcised\" (,nry) from the shrine of Re.199 An inscription at Medamud specifies that such \"conjurations\" (stmt) formed part of the \"divine books\" or liturgical texts \"which protect the Ennead.\"2\u00b00 Nonetheless, as with hk:, the term sni or snty may have positive overtones as well.

A general discussion of the term appears in Borghouts 1970, p. 55, n. 51. As a term for \"spell,\" the phrase was already in use during the Middle Kingdom (Erman 1901, pp. 14-15 [text D, col. 2/61 and V, 6] and cf. p. 34 [text M, col. 8/5--6] where the phrase means \"etc.\" following a list of enemies: \"dead men, dead women, etc.\") Thissen ( 1987) argues that the term hii.s't-r? (with nuance of \"magical spells\") underlies the name \"Ambres\" (Apjpx;), which is given by Horapollo as the title of a holy book possessed by the Egyptian sacred scribes. 196. See Wb 4: by Goedicke 1984, pp. 97-98. Anthes' hesitation (p. 88) is unfounded, however, regarding the unity of the verbs \"to enchant\" (Thi) and \"to ask/say\" (3ini).43 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE It is effective (sii) for a man who makes conjuration (inty) for himself with this book before this noble god.202 As for the recitation (.nw) of this rite (n.t- ), it is effective (5j) for Osiris, it is effective for the one who recites (snty) it.203 A highly questionable relative of this term is the in-ntr(?), \"god-inquirer\" read by de Cenival in the Demotic Papyrus Louvre E 3266, line 8, which concerns the transference of ownership of a one-third share of temple revenue.204 Parallel to sni, the term id, \"to enchant,\" ~~, also represents a specialized nuance of a basic word meaning \"to recite.\"205 As with virtually all of the terminology discussed thus far, the use of the term extends to both magical and ritual contexts. Thus, for example, the \"magical\" use of d in the Horus cippus above is complemented by its appearance in the temple texts of Edfu: hry-hh bt db/h nt hkr.w,fIr r-h? The chief lector priest outfitted with his adomments recites the spells of appearance (literally \"going outside\").206 At Esna, the term Sd is selected by the creatrix Neith to describe her spoken evocation of the cosmos: Let us devise 4 spells (?iow) that we might clarify what is in our bodies (= \"our thoughts\"); let us recite (id) our utterances (tp-r?= w) so that we might know it all today.207 Not only may the word reflect divine speech, but as a title \"Reciter/Enchanter\" it appears both as a divine name and epithet. Although misidentified for over a century with a homophonous, but differently written word meaning \"savior,\" Sd serves as the name of the central healing deity on the magical cippi, either alone or compounded as \"Horus-Shed\" (\"Horus-the-Enchanter\").208 The feminine equivalent of this epithet, t.- ty.t, is applied to 202.

OF MAGIC Isis in hieroglyphic script cippi (adjacent to the hieroglyphic Hr-d) and in Demotic in the London and Leiden Magical Papyrus and elsewhere.209 The curative powers of the deity derive from his or her skill in reciting magical spells to curse, and thus repel, the poison of scorpions and other animals. Cursing seems equally implied in the term for enemy sd-hrw, \"disturber,\" perhaps literally \"one who enchants with the voice.\"210 This nuance of cursing, inherent in both ini and id, is most directly expressed by the verb shwr, IP, (> Coptic s + hwrw, \"wretched/weak\").211 Used by both gods and men, the word possesses a range of meaning which parallels that of the English \"curse,\" extending to mundane oaths of displeasure as well as to the destructive force of \"hexes.\" A comparison of the word's appearance in the \"Instructions of 'Onchsheshonqy\" makes this n -' shw n hf As for a servant who is not beaten, great is the cursing in his heart.212 m-ir f wt.t s r-ir k Don't dwell in a house (or \"place\") cursed by god lest his wrath rebound against you.213 While the former example has only connotations of \"despising,\" the latter is of relevance for the study of hk).214 Presumably operating by magical force, shwr is not infrequently paired with hk?: 209. For ?s.t t; ty.t, see Wilkinson 1878, vol. 3, opposite p. 152 (cippus), and Griffith and Thompson 1909, p. 83, no. 880.

Cf. also the parallel between \"Isis wr.t /hk?.w who knows her spell (r'), who protects Horus with her effective word (?h.t)\" (Rochemonteix et al. 1984-87, p. 233), and \"Isis the mother (Tm .t) who enchanted (.d) Horus in his nest\" (ibid., p. 240); signaled in Cauville 1987, p. 47. 210. See Wb 4: 566/3-9 and Moret 1931, pp. 739-40 and 746-47, where the term describes the activity of the enemies of Osiris in general and that of Seth in particular. Moret (p. 740) translates Id-tirw as \"ceux qui incantent des cris.\" An alternate understanding of the term may be implied in Schott 1929, p. 7 (1. 17), where the determinatives of this epithet of Seth suggest \"He who extracts villainy,\" a N 1 4 4 ,, (ibid., p. 6, \"who sowed enmity\"). 211.

In the Ptolemaic period, texts from Dendera, Edfu, and Esna provide more detailed information on the dis.w, ~ , who appear as hawk-headed associates of Thoth in his role as magician.224 The di's.w themselves may appear in the act of recitation with scroll in hand.225 The most informative text is from Esna where the creation of the dis.w closely follows that of Thoth and Neith's cult center, Sais: Then the seven utterances (d:is.w) came forth from her mouth. They became seven gods. That which she said as the name of the utterances (dRis.w) became the name of hieroglyphs (\"god's-words\") and as the name of Sais. The seven utterances (dis.w) became the protection (s :) of Mh.t-wr.t in every place in which she went.226 The link between these \"utterances\" and ihk is emphasized further in the name of the sec- ond d;its: W , which may be read either ( 'pr hk) or \"equipped behind\" ('prpliwy).227 Even in the latter case a pun could well be intended on \"magic,\" since similar visual and verbal puns are often made on the spelling of hk; with , 28 222.

He has, however, translated this as \"Good of heart,\" which is also possible. Puns could easily be intended on both \"heart\" and \"magic\" with \"first\" and \"after,\" since the dis.w are divinized magical concepts which arose first in the \"heart\" and came forth \"after\" as spoken magic.

Magic by ingredient or essence is equally well represented in the Egyptian vocabulary. Most such terms pertain either to objects and potions which are made up of individual magical \"elements\" or to amulets which by design and/or material convey magical force. For the latter, the basic term is s,, \"amulet/talisman,\" an extended usage of the identically written word for \"protection.\"238 A corresponding extension of meaning occurs p. 134. Faulkner translates s', ' as \"protective rite,\" but the term may mean only \"worship/praise\"; compare the identically written presumed verbal \"to boast/ pride [oneself]\"). For the derivative of meaning \"chapel\" (\"place of adoration\"), see Ritner 1984a, p. 177. Faulkner's translation is based on the nuance \"to drive off,\" ascribed to the term in Wh 4: 55/11-13, and that of \"police\" (\"one who drives off\") in Wh 4: 55/14-18. The latter term appears in Naville 1892, pl. 20, applied to dwarfs in procession with lector priests (pry-!ib), and was translated \"police\" (Aufseher) in Spiegelberg 1920b, p. 60. A translation \"praiser\" might be equally permissible, though the nuance of \"police\" is elsewhere clear; see now Andreu 1987. The rite s'.; appears also in Pap. Vienna 6319, cols. 4/31 and 3/22, where it was understood by the editor as the verb \"to magnify\" with a special technical meaning \"to give magical protection\" (Reymond 1977, p. 88, n. b). 235. In Pap. BM 10188, col. 3/23, the term is followed by \"words said by the two long-haired ones\" (women impersonating Isis and Nephthys) and in col. 9/13 by the phrase \"without seeing, without hearing. Words said by the lector priest.\" Recitations then follow in both examples. Compare, however, Faulkner 1936, p. 134, who takes the phrase as \"a kind of stage-direction indicating an act external to the actual recitations.\" 236. For the supposed title, see W~ngstedt 1981, pp. 24-25.

Medical and \"magical\" texts contain recipes to avert the effects of \"the craft of amulets.\"246 The pairing of the \"amulet-man\" and \"doctor\" in Papyrus Ebers, both as professional colleagues and-in the case of negative sorcery- professional opponents, underscores the intimate relation between medicine and magic, whose connecting, religious link is embodied in the presence of the priest of Sakhmet (the goddess of plague and disease). 243. See the royal jubilee rituals in Naville 1892, pl. VIII, nos. 22-23 and Gardiner 1917, p. 41.

Thus, in the ninth case of the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus which concerns a fractured skull, the term is applied to a compress of broken ostrich shell used for reasons of \"sympathetic magic,\" due to \"the resemblance of the frontal bone to a segment of the shell.\"248 The association of this \"prescription\" with magic cannot be questioned, for directly following the description of the remedy is a spell (dcli in hk.w hr pru.t t1, \"that which is said as magic over this prescription\") to activate its curative powers.249 In the New Kingdom, the term is found with clearly negative overtones in the \"harim conspiracy\" papyrus (Papyrus Rollin) which contains an accusation of the making of phlr.t n dig gn ' I In , \"potions for laming human limbs.\"250 In Demotic, the word is a commonplace of the magical papyri, appearing as \"a remedy for a donkey's not moving,\" \"a potion for causing a woman to love you,\" etc.251 The magical nuance of;phr.t survives into Coptic, where as SntX pC B, B pl it may mean either \"medical remedy\" or \"magical potion.\"252 The latter use is unmistakable in a Bohairic version of Galatians 5:20: 247.

In a Demotic papyrus of the Ptolemaic period, a guild of a competing class of funerary priests, the coachytes (w; iw, \"water-pourers\"), agrees not to encroach upon these embalmers, deciding r tn /iwy phr.t r nwvt n py: n .my, \"not to put remedies (embalming materials) on the dead in our work- shop (\"house\").\"255 That the term was one of general currency is shown by a corresponding embalmer's I shall complete it (the mummy) with embalming materials, and 1 shall give it into the hand of your coachyte.\"256 These \"remedies\" for the dead find their divine counterpart in Sokar, \"the golden remedy (mr.i) in the temples.\"257 The deity of inertness, Sokar contains within himself the seed of regeneration. As the recipient of the dead, he constitutes the apex of the \"medical history\" of any man: the remedies of life (ordinary plra'), the remedies of death (embalming phr.t), and the remedy of rebirth (Sokar as phpt). 253. nTILwM NTC DtAG HKH MPI IThe of the New p. 418 and Crun 1939, p. 176b, s.i'.

Indeed, the title most closely approximating the English \"doctor,\" swnw, , may be applied as well to the embalming priest, and is translated into Greek as cztptXEurilg, \"embalmer.\"258 It is in this capacity that the archetypal deity \"the chief physician.\"259 The concomitant magical aspects of medicine are similarly granted divine patronage in the person of Hr-swnw-nfr, \"Horus the good doctor,\" whose utterances (tp-r?) bite,\" (hk ?) \"pacifies inflammation.\"260 Honored in Letopolis as \"chief physician in the house of Re,\"261 Horus the doctor is indistinguishable from \"Horus the Reciter\" (Hr-Sd), whose role in the curing of scorpion bite has been discussed above. This conception of deity as doctor is by no means restricted to Anubis and Horus; Amon, Isis, Imhotep, et al., are invoked for remedies, and the Demotic Papyrus Insinger (col. 18/23) goes so far as to identify deity and remedy: \"A daily remedy is to prevent disease by having the greatness of god in your heart.\"262 The frequent appearance of deities and magic in the treatment of illness derives from an Egyptian conception of disease as \"the stroke (s.t- J ) of a god, a go, o goddess, of a dead man, or of a dead woman.\"263 258.

Thus even the application and removal of bandages and the measurement of drugs may become a ritual accompanied by the recitation of spells.265 ENCIRCLING The suggested root of the word for remedy, phr.t, is the verb phr, A \"to go around/encircle,\" whose own magical connotation \"to enchant\" may lie at the heart of that of phr.t: \"that which encircles/contains/controls\" > \"that which enchants/protects/ potion.\"266 As an example of Egyptian terminology expressing magic by rite, phr exhibits a long and complex development which well repays study. The magical ritual of \"encircling\" (dbn, plhr) for purification is almost coeval with Egyptian civilization itself, being attested 681 (de Buck 1956, p. 306) and in Pap. BM 10188, cols. 1/27 and 14/26 (s.t-'). For the latter examples, see Faulkner 1933, pp. 3 and 27 and 1936, pp. 123 and 130.

The notion of circling for protection is common; cf. the protective function of h?, \"around\" in the standard (and archaic) expression s> 'nh h NN, \"May the protection of life be around NN\" and variants, in Wb 3: 9/15-17 and Gardiner 1903, pp. 334-36. Specific examples of protective circles of magic include CT spell 342 (de Buck 1951, p. 347): \"magic encloses (Tnn) its settlements.\" As noted by Faulkner 1973, p. 277, n. 6, this containment is \"presumably in a protective sense.\" The encircling arms of the personified Western Desert serve a similar purpose: \"With my arms having encircled (phjr) you forever and ever, truly I shall be the protection (s') of your flesh\" (Davies and Gardiner 1915, p. 48 and pl. 10). See also the text of Nephthys on the door of the third shrine of Tutankhamun: \"I have encircled you (phr.n-y hik); you are not weary; these limbs of yours are not weak,\" in Piankoff and Rambova 1955, p. 72 and p1. 72 (related to BD spell 151 c \u00a7SI, in Allen 1974, p. 148).

Thus, a Thirteenth Dynasty text believed to derive from an original of the Third Dynasty contains several references to the funerary procession \"circulating around the mastaba four times.\"267 Over a millennium later, Ptolemy IX is the recipient of a similar rite of \"circulating around four times\" in the \"purgatorium\" at Edfu.268 It is a testament to the longevity of Egyptian rituals that even the vessels (dir.t) associated with this rite remain unchanged.269 Comparable rituals of circumambulation comprise both public, cultic ceremonies and private, \"magical\" ones.270 In particular, the royal coronation ritual included such a \"procession about the desert\" (dbn h space\" of the kingdom, and a repetition of this encirclement 267. See Gardiner 1955a, pp. 9-17 (Pap. Ramesseum E, col. 74, broken examples in 14a and 27). This text uses the synonym dbn, \"to circulate.\" For the antiquity of the concept, compare the use of s ,10 \"protection around\" as the name of a royal chapel in the archaic period, discussed in Roth 1991, pp. 86 and 164-69. Indisputable ritual circumambulations are described in the Pyramid Texts; see for example, PT spell 659 (\u00a71866): \"Take these white teeth of yours in a bowl, go around them with an arrow in this their name of arrow,\" in Sethe 1910, pp. pp. 211-12; and cf. also n. 297, 268.

Notable also is the purification ceremony enacted by Tuthmosis III at the dedication of an enclosure wall at Heliopolis, in Sethe 1907, p. 832. The king is depicted bearing four jugs of water and is said to go around four times (p/jr h? sp) 4) (I. 9), forming a ritual counterpart to the \"surrounding\" (phr) of the temple by the enclosure wall (1. 13). 269.

The term p/jr serves also to designate the ritualized inspection route of the pyramid complex of Neferirkare (Posener-Krieger 1968, pp. 114 and 117). The implied nuance is uncertain in the dream book Pap. Chester Beatty 3, col. 2/5: (If a man see himself in a dream while) \"his [towns]folk circulate [around him]; [Good]; it means [...J\" (Gardiner 1935, vol. 1, p. !1 and vol. 2, pl. 5).

An elucidation of the concept in Egyptian terms appears in PT spells 366 and 454. With regard to the coronation procession (phr), the king is said to be \"great and enclosing\" (dbn, .n; PT spell 366 \u00a7629), and to embrace all gods, lands, and possessions (PT spell 454 \u00a7847). For these, see Sethe 1908, pp. 339-40 and 471-72 and Faulkner 1969, pp. 120-21 and 151. On the jubilee race, see Kees 1912; idem 1915, pp. 64-69; and Uphill 1965; and for the retention of this ritual action by Akhenaton, see Uphill 1963. For a Ptolemaic equation of the hb-sd race with the encirclement of sacred territory (sh.t, \"mound\"), see (1915, pp. 68-69) considers the Ptolemaic scribes to have been \"confused and incorrect\" in their equation of this rite with that of the p hrr sr.t, \"going about a field\" or hnk sh.t, \"offering a field,\" the essential significance of these rites is identical. What the procession encloses is transferred to its lord (god or king). The ultimate fusion of these rites appears in the agrarian festival of Heka at Esna, in which the god, honored as a rejuvenated king, encircles the fields to restore their vitality (Sauneron 1968, p. [no. circling this mound\"). Perhaps related to this coronation p/r is the expression for heir phr-ns.t, \"he who goes about the throne\" (Wb 1: 547/13-16). See also the processional route indicated in Goyon 1972, p. 35. 272. See Keimer 1933, especially pp. 54-56; Hari 1985, p. 49 and pl. 35 (1. 143); and Gaballa and Kitchen 1969, especially p. 52.

He cannot die by the pest of the year.277 274. See Jankuhn 1972, pp. 21, 23-24, 26, 31, and 66. An unrecognized reference to this or a similar rite may appear in Pap.

Parallel rites of encircling for protection appear also in Coptic magic ritual encircling is given a divine prototype: \"It is the protection of Horus whose heart is glad, whose voice is justified after he went around (phir i) the gods on that day of his being assigned to his inheritance\" (Jankuhn 1972, p. 31). \"It is the protection of Him who bends the knee in the Great Mansion, who goes about (ptr) surrounded (dim) in his protective serpent\" (ibid., p. 66). For the image of the enclosing ouroboros serpent, see above, n. 266. The previously unexplained Ptolemaic writing of phr, with (literally r-tp = \"r atop/superscript [rJ]\") probably derives from the writing J, whose superscript r is itself a back formation from the hieratic phr- sign: ; (Wh 1: 544; cf. Miller 1909b, p. 47, no. 526 [phr/] and p. 8, no. 91 [r]). This back formation from hieratic may date from the Middle Kingdom (Ranke 1935, p. 136, no. 6 [Purr read Phr]). 276.

A curiously similar practice is dictated by modern Texas folklore: \"Walk around the house barefooted in the first snow of the season and you will stay healthy all winter\" (Davis and Gillis 1989, p. 64). Contrast the ancient Mesopotamian rite for home protection which dictates the encircling not of the house, but of the images of potential enemies, in Meier 1941- 44, p. 151: \"The flour circle of Nidaba, the charm of the great gods, have I laid round about you.\"60 oi.uchicago.eduTHE VOCABULARY OF MAGIC A literary echo of this ceremony is perhaps to be recognized in the actions of the heroine of Papyrus Westcar, Rudjedet, who \"makes a circuit of the room\" in which she hears preternatural music.278 At Edfu, all of these nuances of phr are found again in the temple dedication ritual of \"giving a house to its lord,\" in which the king and priests go about the temple, simultaneously purifying the site, delimiting its sacred/cosmic space, and protecting it from external, demonic forces.279 Derived directly from such consecration rituals, though returned to private use, is the po( via3 o pota (plant-harvesting rite, see above, pp. 39-40) of Egyptian origin preserved in the corpus of Greek magical papyri, in which the magician goes about (1tEp1upop) the selected plant three times while fumigating it with pine resin.280 The magical nuance of the verb phr, implicit in earlier usage, becomes explicit phr, J\"/';, the first Setna tale, the term is used to describe the enchanting of heaven, the underworld, the mountains, and the seas so that the magician \"finds out all that which the birds of the sky, the fish of the deep and the animals say.\"282 A direct parallel is found in the \"Fable of Sight and Hearing\" (\"I enchant the sky so that I may listen to that which is in it\"), and one would readily accept the editor's suggestion of a further parallel in Papyrus Vienna 6636 ([pj]ry phi nwny.t [...], \"I go forth were it not for the determinative ('r) of phl, which suggests the verb of motion \"to go about (the underworld).\"283 Less trivial than it may appear at first sight, the ambiguity of this example is paralleled elsewhere, and implies that the notions of \"encircling\" and \"enchanting\" are still fully melded-differing determina- tives notwithstanding. Thus within an oracular statement in the \"Demotic Chronicle\" (col. 2/11) the moon is said to phr', V'tI',, the depths and the king to t' '.t. For the text, see de Buck 1970, p. 87.

The \"magical\" examples of Setna et al. take on even greater significance when it is realized that they reflect the culmination of an ancient topos describing the control of the universe by the sun god, who is variously said to \"go about\" (phr) and \"rule\" (iq) the earth, heaven, and underworld.285 From the evidence of the Demotic texts, the two terms may be synonymous-Re rules by enclosing and enchanting. In fact, a Demotic version of a much-copied solar hymn replaces the hieroglyphic determinative of \"to enchant.\"286 Rather than being an error on the part of the copyist, this may instead reflect a clarification (or later re-interpretation) of the ancient text. Forming a divine counterpart to the coronation procession about the walls and desert, the circuit of Re both delineates the universe and establishes his sovereignty over it. In the course of the development of Egyptian theology, participation in this cosmic circuit had been extended to the king (already in the Pyramid Texts), and the privilege was ultimately claimed by the blessed dead (Book of the Dead) in funerary texts which had as their stated goal the subjugation of the universe to the needs of the deceased.287 From the very nature 284.

Earliest of the Demotic funerary texts, the papyrus contains transformation spells in which the deceased becomes a \"dog enchanted in all his limbs\" (iwiw p/r m 'twe f nb) that \"his ba go about as a dog on earth and the underworld daily\" (phr sp 2 by ifm iwiw mrne by. f m iw, IlT t tv ,.t m hr-hirw).288 It is within the context of these funerary texts that one must understand the formula which is recited in Setna I \"to enchant heaven, the underworld,\" et cetera. Providing not merely the logical origin of the formula's terminology, the funerary corpus constitutes as well the only antecedent for the spell's purpose. The implications of this relationship are clear; Setna's spells are funerary spells used with equal facility by the living, and the phr involved is not simply figurative, but-as in the case of the mortuary literature from which it derives-represents a fusion of the magician with the god Re in his circuit. The likelihood of such an assertion is confirmed by the accompanying formula in Setna. Designed for seeing the bark of Re in heaven from both the underworld and the earth, the spell is expressly stated to be of use for both living and dead, corresponds directly to Book of the Dead spells 133-34, and contains within itself the means for effecting a circuit of \"Spell for letting a man return (p/r) to see his house (on earth),\" in Naville 1886, vol. 2, p. 342 and Allen 1974, p. 108. Further illustrative examples include BD spells 178 f \u00a7S2 (deceased circles like Re); 179b \u00a7$3 (gods circle in train of deceased); 149 e \u00a7S2 (Lunar Eye of Horus circles for deceased), etc. 288.

I am not enclosed!\"291 Though the deceased is encircled in the Book of the Dead, he may escape by divine aid: \"The spell (r) of his (scil. Osiris') enemies is around (h i) me, but I have been illumined since you have illumined my face.\"292 Papyrus Chester a \"Book for an Enemy,\" warns: \"Take care of this book ... Do not let 289. For the second spell in Setna I, see Griffith 1985, pp. 20-21 and 25 1980, pp. 128-31. \"If you recite the second formula, whether you are in the underworld or whether you are in your form on earth also, you will see Pre rising in heaven with his Ennead and the moon in its form of rising\" (3/14-15). The additional passages stipulate that the reciter sees also the stars in the sky and the fish in the deep. The envisioned circuit thus includes both heaven and the lower ocean. The comparable BD spells 133-34 \"Roll for initiating the blessed one,\" are found in Naville 1886, vol. 2, pp. 343-46 and Allen 1974, pp. 108-10. The accompanying directions, which are explicitly designed for a living \"initiate\" (\"do riot use for anyone except yourself\"), include the preparation of a bowl painted with an image of the solar bark. Filling the bowls with water or oil may have enhanced their use in scrying; BD spell 134 recommends that the image of the person to be visualized in the solar boat should be anointed with oil. Unrecognized evidence for the actual practice of this rite is forthcoming from the tomb of T-,n-n( r)-hh.w (Bresciani. Pernigotti, and Silvis 1977, pp. 73-75., and pl. 27). A similar bowl, misinterpreted as a terracotta hypocephalus and suggested to be of Greco-Roman date, appears in Maspero 1902, p. 285. The bowl contains registers of deities drawn in meal and plaster \"ddlay s dans de l'cau.\" A rite for seeing the bark of Re appears also in the Demotic London and Leiden Magical Pap., col. 27 (Griffith and Thompson 1904, pp. 156--63). For the question of the use of funerary spells by the living, compare Gilula 1978 and Wente 1982. For further examples of bowl magic, see below, Chapter 5, nn. 1017 and 1020. 290. The example of phr, \"to enchant\" in Tait 1976 (see n. 283, above) could easily represent a pun upon the original nuance of \"to go about,\" as the speaker is a bird who could literally \"go about/enchant the sky\" to listen to what is in it. Demotic orthography simply makes explicit a magical nuance equally present in earlier usage. This is particularly clear in the London and Leiden Magical Pap.. in which hieratic writings ,,;and Cs n alternate with Demotic 1 and ~ .in identical contexts and often within the same spell (Griffith and Thompson 1909. p. 32, no. 318 and 1904, pp. 34- 35 [col. 3/20: phr.t n ph.mr the hieratic walking legs determinative, these examples must represent the extended meaning \"to enchant.\" 291.

This hostile encirclement is to be contrasted with the text's immediately previous proclamation (\u00a7d S3) by the son(?) of Nut: \"1 have surrounded (phr.ny h) h,:) my another encircle/control (plr) it! \"293 The magical implications of the act are readily apparent in a series of statements regarding Seth, who figures as both sorcerer and victim. Thus the \"dramatic Ramesseum papyrus\" re-enacts the murder of Osiris at the hands of the confederates of Seth by ritually encircling a figure of the slain god with goats.294 Conversely, the avenger of Osiris threatens in the \"Anti-Seth Book\": iw v d.t phr ,w v (var. wi, ) r ir s I shall cause a curse to circulate against the one who did it.295 Just such an \"encirclement\" of the powers of Seth by the avenging Horus is attested, though previously unrecognized, in Coffin '1 controlled (pr/) the powers of Seth in addition to his own powers.296 An earlier reference to this act is presumably to be found in the \"encircling of Horus\" invoked in Pyramid Texts spell 509.297 Coming \"full circle,\" Seth appears again as an \"encircler\" in his beneficent role as the protector of the solar bark from the chaos monster Apophis. Addressing the monster, Seth declares in Book of the Dead spell 108: 293. Verso 7/7, in Gardiner 1935, vol. 1, p. 74 and vol. 2, pl. 46.

My magic (hk>) has been given to me against you ... I have encircled/enchanted (ph-) the sky, while you are rubbed out (var. \"in bonds\").298 This clear association of the terms p/r, and hk: argues persuasively that the author of the text was fully cognizant of the \"magical implications\" of the former. Moreover, foreshadowing the Demotic examples of \"enchanting the sky\" for knowledge, the spell was designed to enable the practitioner to \"know the souls of the West.\"299 If the magical aspects of the theme of \"encircling heaven, the underworld, and earth\" are often ambiguous. those of the idiom \"encircling the heart,\" (phr-lb/l~t), are not. Attested at least as early as the Eighteenth Dynasty, the idiom is applied to the qualities of an individual (god, king, or man) that are able to \"captivate\" the minds of mankind. Thus, a New Kingdom hymn to Osiris declares: i:rn.t-f phr.ii s in the Ptolemaic temple at Edfu, it is the fear of the king which \"circulates within hearts\" (p/r -ni :t).30l In a Demotic astrological handbook, the conceded to a born individual: [iwif ijp'h1 'tu(ii) heart of mien.\"t,)2 Such \"bewitchment\" need not imply actual magical activity, but, like its English counterpart \"enchantment,\" depends upon the imagery of such activity for its impact. It is a figurative use of the nuance \"to enchant,\" which is itself an extended use of the verb \"to go about.\" An example of such a \"heart-enchantment\" is 298. See Naville 1886, vol. 2, p. 245 and Allen 1974, pp. 85-86. 299. See Naville 1886, vol. 2, P. 245 and Allen 1974. p. 85. 3(X).

[sm].w n phr-hit, \"the small heart-enchantments.\"303 Nonetheless, it should be remembered that any speech delivered by Thoth could be considered ipso facto a genuine vocal spell by virtue of his role as \"Excellent One of Magic\" and \"Lord of Divine Words.\"304 A specifically literal use of the phrase occurs in an Old Coptic spell from the great magical papyrus of Paris, in which the magician declares: 16 TTC P CCTHC, \"I will enchant her heart.\"305 Underscoring the original association of \"enchanting hearts\" with actual magic, Heka announces to the king his coronation: sphr =y hk.w- k m ib.w, \"1 have caused to circulate in hearts.\"306 With the causative verb sphr, (I , our investigation of the tripartite nature of Egyptian magic concludes as it began, for the verb means not only \"to cause to circulate,\" but also \"to copy\" texts, and puns upon the association of magic and word.307 A DEFINITION OF MAGIC As is evident from the foregoing, rather prolonged discussion of phr, the physical act of \"encircling\" underlies an elaborate complex of magical conceptions which culminate in the adoption of the term as an expression for \"enchanting.\" The terminology and significance of a simple rite of circumambulation (phr) to \"contain\" or coerce has been extended both to an application of ingredients (phr.t) which \"contains\" disease, and to words which \"encircle\" the heart (phr.-it) and thoughts of men. The results obtained from this single example of \"magic by rite\" suffice to suggest a new methodology for the study of Egyptian magic, for it demonstrates that the practical mechanics of magic may provide a focus not only for the pertinent materials (magic by essence) and attendant spells (magic by word) of any magical procedure, but also for the fundamental meaning of the procedure itself. It is in the rite-and not the spell-that the essence of Egyptian magic is to be sought. By 303. Spiegelberg 1917a, pp. 30-31 and 133, no. 278 (col. 10/1). 304. See above, p. 35 and n. 160. 305.

Indeed, Egyptian magical rites have been characterized as commonplace, and their study dismissed as unrewarding.309 Nonetheless, as evidenced by the analysis of phrr, sufficient information survives to provide insights by no means trivial. Nor is the supposed \"universality\" of Egyptian ritual grounds for disregard. Thus, although ritual encirclement is well documented in many cultures, the centrality of the rite in Egyptian magic is striking, and its uses and terminology uniquely Egyptian.3 1( In any case, it is the viewpoint of the Egyptian practitioner, and not that of the comparative historian, which determines the significance of the rite. That the rite was of fundamental significance to the success of Egyptian magic is evident not merely by the presence of specified directions in rubrics and depictions in literary, religious, medical, and even historical texts, but also by the very turns of phrase which the Egyptian employed to describe magic. Thus in addition to the simple ir- ik:, \"doing magic,\" there are found such expressions as sp, \"spell\" (literally \"deed\"); sp nI s, \"deed security! exercising magical control.\"311 Such terms are not, of course, restricted to instances of 308. See the apologia in Tanmbiah 1968, p. 175: \"the orthodox anthropological approach devalued the role of Words in ritual which was seen as stereotyped behaviour consisting of a sequence of non-verbal acts and manipulation of objects\"; and cf. the discussion of rites in idem 1973. 309. See the remarks of Sauneron 1966, pp. 34-36 and 42: \"Peut-on parler du 11 est, it aut le reconnaitre. des plus reduits, et se rani~ne a tun petit nombre d'6kements ...\" (p. 36); \"Les formlules, cela est evident, constituent l'd'lment principal de toute action magique\" (p. 42). Compare also the comments of Malinowski (1948. p. 51): \"Follow one rite, study one spell, grasp the principles of magical belief, art and sociology in one case, and you will know not only all the acts of the tribe, but, adding a variant here and there, you will be able to settle as a magical practitioner in any part of the world yet fortunate enough to have faith in that desirable art.\" 310. For circuniambulation in Greco- Romnan and Christian magic. see above. n. 280; for Coptic uses, see above. n. 274. Mesopotamian examples appear in J. and A. Westenholz 1977, pp. 203 and 214-15; the motif was already well documented in R. C. Thompson 1971. pp. lviii and passim. 311 more than the English phrase \"magical practice\" which subsumes magic by speech, amulet, or potion. They are, however, indicative of a fundamental understanding of magic as \"a thing done\"-not simply \"a thing said\" or \"a thing possessed.\" As the only member of the \"magical triad\" broad enough to include the other two, magic by rite is the logical point of departure for an investigation of the range and significance of Egyptian hk?. By focusing upon the magical act rather than the spoken spell, the investigator avoids the subjective ambiguities discussed above in Chapter 1, and is able to formulate an objective criterion for judging the \"magical\" nature of any given act. For the purpose of this study, any activity which seeks to obtain its goal by methods outside the simple laws of cause and effect will be considered \"magical\" in the Western sense. To what extent this \"working definition\" of magic conforms to the Egyptian understanding of hk will, it is hoped, become clearer in the course of investigation. Just such an approach to Egyptian hk? was suggested in 1925 by Lexa, who added a significant caveat: Western and Egyptian conceptions of magical actions will not always conform, for certain acts which seem dependent upon the law of causality to one culture may be viewed as \"magical\" by another.312 Thus, a remedy for graying hair which incorporates the blood of a black bull could reflect a \"primitive\" understanding of blood as the carrier and transmitter of the animal's qualities, while another culture might see in the act only \"magic spells.\" Unrecognized examples are found in ibid., pp. Hor 18, spell\" (versus ed., \"its remainder\"); el Din 1974, pp. 266-67 652 (0. w ir f, \"For making '?y' by spell which is to be used.\" Both of these examples could represent hostile sorcery since the former switches from praises to curses at sp, and the latter seems to contain a recipe for inflicting the '?y r-disease/possession (Wb 1: ir (?yI n spe mean \"attempting (a cure for) '?y' by spell\" (Ritner 1990, p. 33, n. 28). With sp-n-sh should be contrasted the expression for magic in Setna I, col. 4/23: wp.t n sh nfr, \"the work of a good scribe,\" in Griffith 1985, pp. 114-15. Further unrecognized examples of sp.w, \"spells\" (translated \"deeds\") appear in Faulkner 1958, pp. 29* and 13 (col. 18/12): \"Isis Lady of spells\" (cf. col. 18/13: \"Isis who the gods with what she says\") and pp. 31* and 14 (col. 19/25): \"Nephthys For t-iwy.t, p. 62b: 21-60y(0, 61- XOYG).

The term also appears in the literary Pap. Spiegelberg (Petubast), col. 2/22 in a confrontation over the diadems of Amon, in Spiegelberg 1910, pp. 16, 17, and 4*. Clearly hostile use of the term occurs in Pap. Insinger, col. 32/14: \"He (scil. God) created life and death before him for the torment(?) (t-iwy.t) of the impious man\" (Lichtheim 1980, p. 211). 312.

Opposition to Lexa's definition of magic was forthcoming in a review by Roeder who, noting that magic could be analyzed in a narrow or wider sense, found that Lexa's \"overly broad\" definition inflated the scope of magic in Egyptian culture \"which knew nothing of the law of causality.\"314 Moreover, Roeder professed regret that this definition, by stressing action, did not concentrate on the \"fundamental conceptions\" of magic.315 Such objections provide their own rebuttal, for if one is to study the \"fundamental conceptions\" of Egyptian magic it may be done only by looking at magic in its widest possible sense. To arbitrarily exclude aspects of magic from discussion because \"it is fully in accordance with the practice of Egyptologists\"316 in no way provides insight into the fundamental nature of magic and severely and artificially limits the scope of investigation. There can be no \"wide\" and \"narrow\" magic. Nor does the concentration upon action in any way exclude the possibility of grasping these fundamentals, as is clear from the analysis of phr. Whether the Egyptians consciously recognized a \"law of normal causality\" is open to dispute.317 Despite the statement of Lexa to the contrary, no Egyptian term corresponding to \"natural forces\" can be identified.318 One Egyptian term which has been suggested to apply to both \"the (ordinary) force of nature\" and the force of hk? is hp, the word for \"custom\" or \"laW.\"319 In the two Demotic Setna stories (as well as in an unpublished Berlin papyrus) the word appears in the combination lip ii sij (\"a hp of writing\") as an expression for a written spell.32 Although Nims has sought to explain this usage as indicating \"customary\" 313. See Lexa 1925, p. 16, for his discussion of spells 29 and 30 from Pap. Ebers. With his analysis should be compared the comments of Frazer 1971, pp. 17-18 and 37 on Hindu and Greek parallels. 314. Roeder 1928, p. 197. 315. Roeder, ibid., p. 197. 316. The statement is from Gardiner 1922, p. 263a. Like Roeder, Gardiner recognized a broad and narrow approach to magic. Unlike his contemporary, however, Gardiner (in his \"broader\" view) even insisted upon the essential unity of magic and religion. Nevertheless, he bowed to \"custom\" and excluded from his study rites for the dead and for the gods. 317. See the remarks of Gardiner 1922, p. 262, who suggests that the distinction between magical and ordinary actions was never consciously made. 318. Lexa 1925, vol. 1, p. 17, suggests that nht.w. nht.t, or wsr.w describe natural law. Rather, all these terms mean simply \"strength\" or \"power\" (Wh 1: 362-63 and pp. 196-97 (col. 6/15).

In line 13, the magician animates a ship of70 oi.uchicago.eduTIlE VOCABULARY OF MAGIC Egyptian magic as opposed to foreign enchantment, the original explanation by Griffith as \"written formula\" (\"a pattern of writing\") seems preferable.321 Recently, Reymond has published a Vienna papyrus in which she found evidence of Heka as the controller of a *Pr-hp, which she translated as \"House of Natural Law\" and associated with the terminology in the Setna tales. By implication, magic and ordinary natural force would be undifferentiated by the Egyptians.322 However, the reading IHk? is far from clear, and the supposed *Pr-h p, ' 4., 1A, is in actuality pr- 'nh, \"scriptorium.\"323 The relation of hk? to ordinary nature thus remains to be specified. As noted above, hk? is certainly a part of the natural cosmic order. It would not seem, however, to be part of the normal mundane order. The effects of hk\" are not \"supernatural\"; they are \"supernormal\" or \"extraordinary.\" The implications of Lexa's definition of magic have yet to be realized, and to date no treatment of Egyptian magic (including that of Lexa) has concentrated primarily upon the actual practice of the magician. As a result, the instructions which accompany spells in the so-called \"rubrics\" with their vignettes and lists of materials, instruments, and ritual actions remain largely uninvestigated. Fifty years after Lexa's recognition of the importance of rubrics for the identification of magic, Morenz urged a study of them to settle the question of the \"magical\" nature of funerary texts and their potential use by the living; his desideratum is still unfulfilled.324 The present study seeks not only to correct this deficiency (compare the discussion of Setna's use of funerary spells, above, pp. 61-64), but to wax by hp-n-sh, \"magical formula.\" For a synopsis of this text, see Zauzich 1978, p. 36. The Demotic tale is paralleled by an Aramaic translation in Cowley 1923, pp. 179-82, no. 71, republished by B. Porten 1986, p. 16 (\"The Tale of for son of Pawenesh\"). 321. Nims 1948, p. 245.Contra Nims, ibid., p. 245, nn. 22 and 23, the Egyptian magician Hor is specifically described as using a hp-n-shj only once (col. 6/15, not cols. 6/14 or 6/20). Elsewhere, both he and the Nubian use simply hyq. See col. 5/17, and cf. col. 5/13 in which the book of Thoth used by Hor is called t rnmdy n hyq, \"the book of magic,\" in Griffith 1985, 186-87. The term hIyq/.tks requires no modifier to mark it as Egyptian. Nims was correct, however, in recognizing that the nuance of \"custom\" in the term hp,Q probably provides the explanation for its use in these passages. As the meaning \"law\" of hp derives from the nuance of \"customary patterns\" of activity, so hp-n-sih should reflect a customary written pattern, or \"formula.\" It is interesting to note that recently published Egyptian \"law codes\" are formulated strictly according to the notion of \"pattern\" (Mattha and Hughes 1975, p. 22 and passim: \"If a man does X ... here is the pattern of the petition (etc.) which he shall make\"). The similarity of legal and magical phraseology is also notable in Greek papyri (Levi 1975). 322. Reymond 1977, pp. 153 and 200 (Pap. Vienna D. 6614, 1. 2). For her idiosyncratic discussion of hlp as \"natural law,\" see pp. 137 and 153. Reymond's interpretation is repeated in idem 1983. 323. The writing of the supposed Pr-hp is easily shown to be pr- 'nh (Erichsen 63). MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE confront systematically the wider question of the interpenetration of magic, religion, and medicine. Rubrics, complemented by tomb and temple scenes, surviving artifacts, and literary and historical documents form the raw materials. Clearly, it would be impossible to analyze all magical methods in a single study; only a selection of the most representative can be dealt with here. Nonetheless, these will suffice to demonstrate the utility of the method. This approach to Egyptian magic has, like \"behaviorism\" in social psychology, the advantage of simplicity; clearly indicated behavior-not intuited mental attitude-provides the focus. As a result, the continuity of any given genre of magic is easily traced (e.g., encirclement for purification), as is the impact of one genre upon another (medical upon funerary magic, curses upon love charms). Unlike behaviorism, however, this study must also seek to understand the connections between word (the spell) and act (the rite) and object (magical material). Ultimately, the deferred question of the identity of the magician and his social role must be considered.72 oi.uchicago.eduCHAPTER 3 SPITTING, LICKING, AND SWALLOWING .whom Thoth himself has taught, and into whose mouth Seshat has spat Stela Cairo JdE 46200 Palette Berlin 7798 One day St. Automona di Meris, seeing a young novice yawning, suddenly spat into her mouth, and that without malice or thought of mischief.

English idiom oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE The oral dimension of Egyptian magic so prominent within native terminology extends well beyond the simple recitation of spells to include ritualized usage of the common bodily actions of spitting, licking, and swallowing. Each of these actions has a long history within the practice of Western magic and folklore, and all have been ritualized in other cultures as well, both ancient and modern. Similarity of practice, however, may mask a variety of interpretation and intent, and even within a single culture any one magical technique may function in disparate ways. Such is certainly the case with the techniques discussed here, for all are \"bivalent\" in Egyptian practice, being used to transfer powers whether healing or harmful. SPITTING AND SPITTLE Of these three ritual acts, the best known-and most thoroughly discussed-is the technique of magical spitting.325 The conspicuous position accorded to spitting in Egyptian myth and ritual is commensurate with the surprisingly rich vocabulary pertaining to \"spit\" and \"spittle\" in the Egyptian language, comprising well over twenty words and expressions: ?b.t, /, is s, d, i(d), qys, tf, tfn, dp/tp, and d>k.326 While some of these terms may properly indicate related actions and nouns (\"pour/flow out,\" \"vomit,\" \"saliva,\" etc.), the lexical (and cultural) significance of the concept is nonetheless clear, and is underscored by the standard selection of a spitting mouth (,,) as the hieroglyphic determinative for words signifying fluids of any variety, as well as \"flow,\" \"pour,\" \"spit,\" \"gush,\" \"vomit,\" and sign 325.

So common was the hiero- glyphic sign of the spitting mouth that it was chosen to represent the basic letter \"p\" (<p 'y) in late and enigmatic writings.328 CREATION BY SPITTLE Well known from the Heliopolitan creation myth in which the sun god's spittle forms the primordial pair of Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture), the act of spitting occurs repeatedly in mythological and ritual contexts as an expression of generative force. Gods, kings, demons, animals, plants, materials, and even the earth itself may be viewed as the product of spitting.329 O you whom the Pregnant One spat (nin&) forth ...330 O Atum-Khepri ... you spat out (iSS) Shu, you expectorated (tfn) Tefnut.331 Atum spat (i) me out as the spittle (i,) of his mouth together with my sister Tefnut.332 Raise yourself Re ... spit out (h ) the day.333 His name is 'One who spits out (bhi) the Inundation.'334 328. Less frequently, the sign may substitute for m, iw, or tfit; see de Wit 1956, pp. 111-16. 329. are 406-)7 (considered concept). Generative spitting is frequently encountered; in hymns from the Hibis temple alone, Amon is said to have spit out winds, lions, and gods (Norman de Garis Davies 1953, pls. 31, II. 6 and 10, and 32, 1. 8). 330.

For further examples, cf. inter alia, CT spells 905, 942, 946, and 951 (though these last two references to the \"rod which spits out [on?] the plebs\" are coupled with a mention of restraining the masses, and may entail a hostile rather than a generative nuance of spitting; cf. CT spell 469 for the rod of Orion by which the deceased \"spits on/out\" the great ones).75 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE My (semen) is more effective than his (scil. Re's) spittle (h \").335 You are the one who spat out (q') the secret, the thought which entered into his heart.336 The most noted \"magical\" application of the creative power of spittle is found within Papyrus Turin 1993 and variants, \"The Legend of Isis and the Secret Name of Re,\" a spell designed to heal scorpion stings.337 Within this recited historiola,338 Isis fashions a serpent from clay and animates it by means of the spittle which drooled from the senile sun god's slackening mouth. The practical directions for using the spell involve not spitting but licking, and are discussed below. The creative power of spittle as envisioned in these Egyptian tales finds numerous parallels, ranging from Akkadian creation mythology339 to contemporary English and French expressions describing a child as the \"spitting image\" of its parent. In tacit deference to the Freudian theory of dislocation/displacement, this generative aspect of spitting has been explained as deriving from a psychological pairing of spittle with semen and mouth with vulva.340 Within Egyptian thought, the parallelism of semen and saliva is confirmed by the myths of Shu and Tefnut, who are variously described as begotten from Atum by spitting or by masturbation. It was I who created excitement with my fist; I copulated with my hand; I let fall from my own mouth. I spat forth as Shu; I expectorated as Tefnut.341 The same pairing seems evident in Book of the Dead spell 110, quoted above, where-if correctly reconstructed-the deceased contrasts the fertility of his semen with the spittle of Re. The suggested \"equivalence\" of mouth and vulva is less certain in Egyptian speculation, however, for if the irregular birth of Seth from \"the Pregnant One\" may be described in terms of spitting,342 the conception of Shu and Tefnut takes place not in the mouth but in the hand: 335.

Shu, Tefnut, Ka, Vulva.'343 The featured role of the hand as vulva is here intended to complement its function in Atum's creation of Shu and Tefnut by masturbation; in both, the hand is seen as playing the feminine role.344 A parallel concept has been noted in the Mayan tales of the Popol Vuh.345 Psychoanalytic theory notwithstanding, supposed Egyptian equations of mouth and vulva rest primarily on mistranslations in which the ejection of saliva/semen from (m) the mouth is interpreted as ejection into the mouth.346 343. Frankfort, de Buck, and Gunn 1933, vol. 1, p. 86 and vol. 2, pl. 85, 1. 41, and cf. 1. 40: \"Then his hands became a vulva.\" See also Vikentiev 1943, pp. 130-31. 344. \"He married his fist, since there was yet no woman\" (Pap. Leiden I 350, col. 5/2-3), in Zandee 1948, p. 92. Thus the title \"God's hand\" is applied to various goddesses as well as the priestess of Amon at Luxor associated with rituals of the primordial creation (Wb 5: 585/1-6; see Leclant 1977, cols. 813- 15). The feminine gender of the word for \"hand\" (dr.t) may have strengthened this concept. These symbolic associations are seemingly overlooked in Sourdive 1984. For the association of the hand of healing statues with the \"hand of Amon,\" see KAkosy 1987, p. bone (scil. \"skull\") spit out its saliva, which landed squarely in the hand of the maiden ... Right away something was generated in her belly, from the saliva alone, and this was the generation of Hunahpu and Xbalanque.\" See also p. 114: \"His son is like his saliva, his spittle.\" 346. Zandee 1972, p. 151, (tacitly reversing his own interpretation in 1948, pp. 69 and 92) objects to the traditional understanding of Atum's creative gestures as complementary, insisting that the god first ejaculated into his own mouth, and only then spit out the divine twins Shu and Tefnut. Unnoted by Zandee, the same suggestion was long anticipated by Budge 1904, vol. 1, pp. 297 and 310, and vol. 2, p. 17. This interpretation derives from the phrase hr mi i?, which the authors understand as \"fall into the mouth\" in CT spell 77 (de Buck 1938, p. 18a-e): \"when he created orgasm, when the 'Chosen' (= 'semen') into his mouth\"; and Pap. Bremner-Rhind, cols. 28/27-29/1: \"My desire came in my hand, semen fell into my mouth.\" Although hr m may have this nuance, in both cases \"fall from\" is the better translation since it is also syntactically acceptable and yields a typical (and expected) reference to Atum's creation by spittle. The description of spittle \"falling from\" Atum's mouth parallels other mentions of Atum's spittle \"coming from his mouth\" (pr m r. f); cf. CT spell 80 (de Buck 1938, p. 31). A variant of CT spell 77 specifies that the fluid which falls from the god's mouth is \"of his mouth,\" a clear reference to oral saliva-not injected semen; cf. the \"spittle of his mouth\" in CT spell 76. The term stp in CT spell 77 should be understood as \"spittle\" rather than \"Chosen/semen\"; see Wb 4: 357/15: \"drip,\" and the unrecognized example in Urk. 6: \"He (Seth) has spat into the sea of the I.tm.t- cow\"; Schott 1929, pp. 22-23, 1. 20, mistranslated \"versiegen(?).\" Further proof, if any be needed, is afforded by the determinative of \"fall\" in the parallel passage in Pap. Bremner-Rhind, col. 27/I, which displays a spitting mouth, not an ejaculating penis. For standard translations of these passages, see nn. 332 and 341, above. Zandee's citation (1972, p. 151, n. 91) of the unrelated CT spell 576 (\"Semen is in my mouth\"; de Buck 1956, p. 191 e) demonstrates only the known link between semen and saliva; it proves no relationship between mouth and vulva. Zandee's interpretation is repeated in his study of CT spell 77 (1973, pp. 71-72).77 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE Notions of \"dislocation\" seem equally irrelevant in the Egyptian pairing of semen and spittle. The ejection of bodily fluids is obviously common to both, and it is as bodily fluids that the pairing of semen and spittle most likely arose. The perceived bond is thus not an exclusive relationship, but shared among all bodily emissions. Divinity was felt to reside within the creator, and was therefore inherent in the god's tissues and fluids. Examples of mythological creation by semen or saliva should be understood no differently from tales of the creation of mankind from the creator's tears, the goddess Sakhmet from his eye, plants and minerals from divine sweat, blood, et cetera.347 In each instance, the cast off portion of the god's body retains divine power and may engender new life. Traditional theory would categorize such a concept as \"magic by contagion\"348 or \"synecdochism,\"349 the rationale for both the veneration of relics and the inclusion of personal effects (oiato) in magical rites.350 SPITTLE AS REMEDY Surely deriving from this same rationale is the ritual use of spittle in the transmission of healing and blessing.351 This is perhaps clearest in texts of purification, in which saliva serves as a medium to convey the invigorating power, and thus the \"blessing\" or skill of a god: My purification is the purification of the spittle which issued from the mouth of Re-Atum.352 347. For the origin of mankind in the tears of Re, see Hornung 1982, pp. 3 (\u00a730, text), 38 (translation), and 54, n. 26 (CT references); for the origin of Sakhmet/llathor, see ibid., pp. 4-6 (\u00a7\u00a745-60. text) and 38- 39 (translation). For the products of divine sweat, blood, tears, and spittle, see Derchain 1965, pp. 137 (cols. 1/1-3/4) and 1*-3*, and above, pp. 39-40 (Pap. Salt 825 and PGM IV, II. 2967-3006). None of these creative acts entails a corresponding \"vulva symbol.\" Similar divine powers are ascribed to the efflux (rdw) of Osiris throughout the mortuary literature, and the notion of divine body parts underlies their standard equation with injured human (and animal) counterparts in mortuary and healing spells (Massart 1959; Dawson 193 I, pp. 26-27 [\"Protection of Parts of the Body 1984, pp. 391-401). Zibelius (1984b, pp. 403-04) would explain the power of creative words on the same basis as \"verbal bodily emissions. 348. See above, p. 9. 349. Pars par toto; \"the belief or practice in which a part of an object or person is taken as equivalent to the whole, so that anything done to, or by means of, the part is held to take effect upon, or have the effect of, the whole\"; Otford English Dictionary ( 1933. vol. 10, p. 381). 350. See below, pp. 210, n. 971 and 224-25, nn. 1043-44. 351. Contra Zibelius (1984b, p. 401), who suggests that the destructive aspect of spittle is primary, with healing aspects being only the use of one destructive force to repel another destructive force. Such an interpretation cannot be reconciled with the use of spittle in creation and blessing where no destructive element is involved. Though the principle of \"venom versus venom\" certainly plays a role in repelling poisons, etc., it is not the primary rationale for all applications of \"healing spittle.\" 352.

Examples of \"medical\" spitting are common throughout the funerary literature, being used within mythological contexts to cure baldness and weak vision,356 injuries of the shoulders, arms and legs, wounds from animal bites, and even instilling breath in a newborn child.357 Within these texts, the use of curative spittle is not limited to the primary gods, but may be applied to-and by-the divinized deceased.

Zibelius 1984b, p. 399.80 oi.uchicago.eduSPITTING, LICKING, AND SWALLOWING Within the conventionally designated \"medical\" texts, spittle is encountered far less frequently. In Papyrus Ebers recipe 499, col. 69/3-5, \"Another (spell) for conjuring a burn on the first occasion (= initial treatment?),\" the god Horus is said to be burnt on the desert, with water to extinguish the fire being present in the reciter's mouth. Actual treatment, however, involves an application of mother's milk rather than spittle.368 A late dynastic treatise detailing therapy for serpent bite prescribes spitting in twenty-one \"emetics\" (sb .w) designed to \"open the throat\" of a patient with constricted breathing.369 A representative example is found in col. 3/9: \"Emetic for the bite of a black-tailed cobra, 1 1 1 1likewise any snake: onion 8 measure, beer 6 and 4 measure, northern salt 4 measure. Grind, swallow, spit out, for four days.\"370 Spitting as a means of administering medicines is found in the Demotic gynecological compilation, Papyrus Berlin P. 13602, 1. 6, in which various roots are selected, \"and then you spit their juice at her face with your mouth.\"371 Though found in \"magical\" texts, more typical examples of curative spitting are logically obvious in their motivation: the spitting out of venom372 and the expelling of bones caught in the throat.373 From the former notion derives the medical treatment of whdw-disease in Papyrus Ebers recipe 131, in which the corruptive agent is urged to be spat forth from the body, while the practitioner spits on the patient's infected limb.374 Direct use of spittle reappears in a Saite Demotic spell against scorpion sting inscribed in the Wadi Hammamat. In this \"spell for enchanting scorpion (sting),\" a series exorcising 368. Wreszinski 1913, p. 131; Deines, Grapow, 1958, p. 215; and Grapow 1958, p. 373. The specified milk of a \"woman who has borne a male child\" is a reference to Isis, the mother of the god Horus invoked in the historiola. Milk is here paired with spittle as yet another divine bodily fluid capable of transmitting curative powers. For this \"drug\" and its continued medical history, see Dawson 1932, 186 [discussion]). 370. Sauneron 1989, p. A similar use of expectorated beer (psg, hb) underlies an emetic process 1970, pp. 27 [col. 13/5, Erichsen 1954b, pp. 368-69. 372. This goal is probably also envisioned in the \"emetics\" of the Brooklyn serpent treatise, noted above. See the incantation in Sauneron 1989, pp. 108-09 (col. 5/12): \"I have caused that its venom go forth to the ground.\" For other typical examples, see Borghouts 1978, (col. 19/2-5), and cf. pp. 124-25 (col. 19/16). Of particular interest is the exhortation of a Vatican papyrus and parallels: \"Come out in spit, come in sweat, come into the face of any bird that you might enter into them\" (Massart 1957, p. 180 [ro. 7, 6-71). 373.

Then you should seal the opening of the wound with it (scil. \"the spittle\").\"375 If notions of inherent divine power and the natural qualities of saliva each played a role in the ritualization of spitting, these last remedies suggest a further meaning for the act, made clearer in Pyramid Texts spell 455. O ... see the purification of my father this king as one purified with zmn and with natron, the saliva which issued from the mouth of Horus, the spittle which issued from the mouth of Seth, wherewith Horus is purified, wherewith the evil which was on him, which Seth did against him, is cast out on the ground; wherewith Seth is purified, wherewith the evil which was on him, which Horus did against him, is cast out on the ground ...376 Here, spittle not only conveys purification and healing, but further conducts corrupting evil away from the body, washing it off harmlessly onto the ground. Spitting thus constitutes a ritual washing, the basic meaning of \"purification\" (w'b) in Egyptian speech and practice.377 The same notion may be one factor implied in the medicinal spitting directed against wMidw and scorpion venom. SPITTLE AS CORRUPTION, CURSE, AND WEAPON In its description of the pathogenic substance , of the pathogenic substance wd, , Papyrus Ebers recipe 131 provides an unambiguous reference to the most common Egyptian interpretation of spitting and spittle. In this and other sources, the purulent agency responsible for disease, aging, and death is depicted as a by-product of unexpelled bodily waste, a source of decay originating in decay.378 Medical treatments therefore standardly entailed purges and emetics to rid the body of such waste, and the recited spell of Ebers 131 envisioned the same result, for wwhdw \"which has come forth from excrement\" was commanded: \"Be spat out! Be vomited out! Perish just as you came into being!\"379 In company with feces and vomit, spittle is here seen as a form of bodily excrement, a source and carrier of corruption and filth. Its potential role in disease is specified in Papyrus Ebers recipe 855b: \"As for the \u00a7\u00a7848-51, in Sethe 1908, pp. 472-74 and Faulkner 1969, p. 151. 377. For examples of ritual washing, see Pap. Leiden 1 348, col. 13/2-3, in which honey, poured into a bowl inscribed with a spell, is used to wash the patient (Borghouts 1970. p. 26, spell 23) and Pap. Ramesseum 16, col. 17/2-3, said by a man while washing in the morning (Gardiner 1955, p. 16 and pl. 55). In both cases, the fluid is charged by the spell, whether written or spoken. For the technique, see also Heerma van Voss 1984, p. 31. 378. Full discussion of w hdw appears in Steuer 1948 and Steuer and Saunders 1959. 379.

It is saliva; all his limbs are feeble.\"380 While saliva was considered the sensory medium for taste,381 food having the \"taste of saliva\" could be construed as a sign of impending death.382 Dripping spittle was felt to characterize both illness and the infirmity of old age,383 and embalming materials were employed to remove this source of decay from the corpse: I have brought to you hd-natron, a ball of incense and Ismn-natron that I may do away with the spittle of your mouths therewith. I have come to do away with the evil that is in your hearts.384 A late echo of this nuance is perhaps to be seen in a fourth century love spell preserved in Old Coptic, in which the accumulation of saliva is an omen of the victim's mental and physical distress.385 Although the concept of spittle as waste and corruption would seem diametrically opposed to its function in blessing and healing, both concepts have natural correlatives,386 and positive and negative nuances may appear together. Coffin Texts spell 667, designed to ensure proper food supply for the deceased in the underworld, proclaims: The detestation of NN is efflux, and NN will not eat what NN's lips spew out ... having flown among his brethren the gods who are in the horizon, he spits on the scalp ... he gives breath to him whose throat is constricted.387 This spell is but a variant of the well-known incantations against the eating of dung in an \"upside-down\" underworld,388 a particularly Egyptian expression of universal fears and taboos regarding discharged bodily \"impurities.\"389 380.

There is thus little distinction between (psychological) insult and (magical) curse. As \"impure\" spittle is viewed to be inherently dangerous, so the act of spitting may be hostile and magically threatening. It is significant that Seth and Apep, the principal adversaries of the gods, were both engendered by spitting,392 and may pose their threat in the same manner. It is in his capacity of god of rain and \"Spewer\" ( Tigy)393 that Seth is especially noted for his evil spitting, from which Osiris is protected, and by which the sea was rendered brackish: As for the Lord of Storm, it is forbidden(?) Seth to spit, when he carries you.394 The Great Ennead has protected you, they have put Seth under you on your behalf that he may be burdened with you, they have warded off his \"evil influence\" (') which he spat out against you.395 Hte (scil. \"Seth\") has spat into the sea of the Hntm.t-cow.396 Magical associations of hostile spitting found an obvious natural counterpart in the ejected venom of serpents, scorpions, insects, and other creatures. This link certainly 390. Examples of spitting as a form of social insult are well discussed in Zibelius 1984b, pp. 405-06, including Helck 1969, pp. \"Those 1\"). 391.

Previously mentioned examples of spitting against scorpion sting and the monstrous Apep serpent form part of this long tradition. O spittle which has come to naught ... O monster lie down!397 O you expectoration of a wall, you vomit of a brick, what comes out of your mouth is turned back against yourself.398 Babi stands up, having met flnty-lmrn. Down/halt spittle!399 May you be spat upon; fall, turn back, turn over!400 A man shall say this spell over a louse from his head; he shall place it on his knee, spitting until a fly comes to snatch it. 401 In these early recitations, a progression of techniques is clear: the offending creature is derided as excrement, its expectorated venom is said to recoil upon itself,402 and the victim may ultimately \"counter attack\" with spittle of his own. \"Hostile spittle\" is thus not exclusively evil, but, as in the last instance, can function positively as a defensive or offensive weapon. The clearest expression of the dual nature of \"venom spitting\" is embodied in the symbol of the uraeus, through which the powers of the feared serpent are made to serve the gods, the king, and mankind.4\u00b03 The dichotomy became proverbial, reflecting contemporary ritual: One rejoices at the Uraeus; One spits upon Apep.404 In similar manner, the hostile spitting of Seth is turned against Apep at the prow of the solar bark,405 and the actions of both may be countered by defensive spitting.

Te Velde 1977, pp. 99-108.85 oi.uchicago.eduTIlE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE Isis, and Nephthys each assume the role of \"Spitter,\" while this aspect of Osiris was even accorded local prominence in his cult center -.... g 0, \"Spit-town.\"406 Funerary texts assign these protective roles to the deceased: I have warded off Seth for you, I have spat on his confederacy for you.407 I am the spitter at the prow of the bark. I have come to provide protection for Osiris.408 I have repulsed Apep; I have spat on the wound.409 The fate of Apep, Seth, and cohorts is explained concisely by a Demotic proverb: He who spits at heaven-it is on him that it falls.410 Heaven's revenge was not confined to mythology, but enacted literally on a daily basis. Accompanying the apotropaic techniques of trampling, stabbing, and burning (with which it was often equated),411 spitting figures prominently in both the recitations and praxis of late 406. To my knowledge, these epithets have not been gathered or studied. \"Osiris as Spitter\" (Wsir m psg/pgs) appears within a list of the god's names in BD spell 142, \u00a7SI, in Allen 1974, p. 118 and cf. ibid., \u00a7S2, translated with hesitation as \"Osiris in the House of Re's Spittle.\" This unidentified cult site is named Psg or Psg-R'; for attestations, see Wb 1: 555/16; Budge 1912, pl. 41, col. 2/8; Gauthier 1925, pp. 47, 152, and 154; and Gardiner 1947, vol. 2, pp. 76*-77*. As recognized by Gardiner, the name properly signifies \"Spit-Town\" or \"Spit of the Mouth-Town.\" An allusion to a mythological event probably associated with the site is found in the ritual against Seth in Urk. 6: \"A falcon enduring of beauty on the night of purification through the power of(?) Spit-town (m slm Pgs).\" The final phrase is understood as \"in (the town of) Shtm-Pgs\" in Schott 1929, pp. 142-43, 11. 10-11. Coffins from the royal caches provide examples of Isis and Nephthys as spitters protecting or healing Osiris (Daressy 1909, p. 87 and pl. 40, middle right [\"Isis the Spitter, Mistress of the West\"]; p. 187 and pl. 56, middle right [\"Isis the Spitter\"]; and p. 112 and pl. 45 [Isis and Nephthys lament Osiris with ( above their outstretched hands]). The epithet \"Spitter\" is written with the ideogram of the spitting mouth. Although it is possible to read this sign as the copula pw (de Wit 1956, p. 116), such an interpretation is grammatically unnecessary, and unlikely in the context. The spittle of Isis is invoked in Pap. Ebers recipe 499, noted above, and both Isis and Nephthys are said to spit on Seth: \"Shu sticks his spear in you, the two sisters spit on you\"; Schott 1929, pp. 130-31, II. 17-18. \"Isis-Scorpion,\" for whom see Goyon 1978b. 407.

Sander-Hansen 1937, p. 48, 1. 96, combining-by implication-both protective and curative spitting. For a further use of spitting imagery with Apep, cf. \"I have caused the nkiw-serpent to vomit what he had swallowed,\" in Urk. 6, 97/9 and Pap. Bulaq 17, cols. (Schott p. 168, correcting Glanville 1955, pp. 28-29). 411. Reflecting the common notion of \"fire-spitting\" serpents (and thus gods and demons); see Urk. 6, 51/7 (Eye of Horus versus Seth): fire spittle is86 oi.uchicago.eduSPITTING, LICKING, AND SWALLOWING temple execrations directed against the two demons and their associates.412 As a form of \"venom against venom,\" this ceremonial spitting ensured the \"social death\"4t3 of its victim: His name will not be in the mouth of the people. It will not be remembered in the heart of the gods. He will be spat upon each time that he is remembered.414 Given the cultic significance accorded such \"destructive\" spitting throughout these rituals, it might at first seem inappropriate that mentions of the sun-god's \"creative\" spitting are also present, and even stressed in two \"Books of Knowing the Transformations of Re and of Overthrowing Apep.\"415 The rationale for such mentions may well be based on the need to evoke a mythological \"primal time\" (in illo tempore), and thereby ensure \"re-creation\" out of chaos and divine triumph over demons.416 The inclusions also provide further insight into the workings of \"magical\" spitting, for if no contradiction seems implied, it is because \"spitting\" is primarily neither positive nor negative, but only \"power- laden.\"417 Saliva is not itself the blessing or curse, but only its conveyer or medium. In execration ritual, saliva is infused with the spoken curse, which spitting directs upon the victim's image. Declarations of the \"creative\" power of spittle do not contradict its against him as fire\"; and Pap. Bremner-Rhind, col. 31/14 (Ennead versus Apep): \"They spit their flame into your eye.\" Compare also the suggested derivation of Il (<p \"w) \"fire\" from p / \"spit\" in Westendorf 1965-77, p. 530. It is significant that ritual spitting often occurs while the image of the victim is on fire: Urk. 6, 5/18 and Pap. Bremner-Rhind, cols. 23/12 and 24/19ff. This is to reinforce the burning, not extinguish it; contrast the insult popular in contemporary Texas: \"I wouldn't spit on him if he were on fire!\" 412. In the anti-Seth rituals of Urk. 6, hostile spitting is invoked within the recitations in Schott 1929, ibid., 5/18, with complete spitting rites in 41/2-43/7 and 53/2-59/16. Comparable Pap. Bremner-Rhind rites versus Apep use spitting imagery appears further in cols. 23/11-12, 26/3, and 28/16-17. Compare also the remarks against Apep at Edfu in Chassinat 1928, p. 342/8. This practice is not a late development; see the proverb of Amenemope (10/20), noted above, and the phraseology of 11. 18, 24, and 26-27 of the heal- ing statue of Ramses III also col. 26/17: \"Be spat on, rebel ... may you be spat on whenever you are remembered\"; and Urk. 6, 51/11 (Eye of Horus versus Seth): \"Your spittle is against him. He is not perceived.\" 415. See Schott 1929, pp. 96-97, 1. 21 (\"You have spat forth yourself as a falcon\"). Pap. Bremner-Rhind examples (detailing the creation of Shu and Tefnut) are contained throughout the two books, cols. 26/21-28/20 and 28/20-29/16, in Faulkner 1933, pp. 59-74. and passim. 417. Contra Zibelius 1984b, p. 401. While some spitting terms have only negative nuances (Ap), most are neutral and are used in both creative and destructive contexts (III, tf, etc.).87 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE \"hostile\" cultic usage; they establish the effectiveness of the vehicle later used against the demon. Such a concept of \"activated\" spittle certainly motivated the praxis of the Wadi Hammamat scorpion spell: \"You should recite [the spell] to your finger while it is moistened with spittle. Then you should seal the opening of the wound with it.\"418 The saliva is here \"charged\" by the words which pass over it, and thus empowered to heal. Comparable procedures are not rare in Egyptian magic. In the \"Book of the Heavenly Cow,\" the speaker's justification is guaranteed by painting an image of the goddess Maat on his tongue. Spoken words passing over the tongue are consequently infused with truth.419 Water poured over the inscribed spells of healing statues is similarly \"impregnated\" by contact. The patient who drinks the water from the statue's basin thereby obtains the curative force of the unspoken texts.420 Carved spells imbue the water of healing basins just as spoken spells imbue the saliva of the mouth. BLOWING Before passing to review the survival of magical spitting within Coptic sources, mention should be made of the late \"subset\" of this technique, the spitting not of saliva, but of air. The envisioned mechanics of \"expectorated breath\" are identical to those of spittle. Thus, in a third century Demotic prescription for curing gout, the topical application of unguents is supplemented: In addition to this, you should blow (nyf) at him with your mouth.421 This manner of treatment was perhaps more common than present textual evidence suggests, since the second century author Celsus notes that Egyptian magicians \"drive demons out of men and blow away diseases.\"422 A fourth century spell attributed to the Egyptian magician Pibechis does recommend the use of blowing in exorcisms, but the text 418. See above, n. 375. 419. Hornung 1982, pp. 25 and 46, 11. 259-60 and cf. Heerma van Voss 1984, pp. 25-26. The reciter is thereby rendered \"pure of tongue\"; for the idiom, cf. BD spell 178, \u00a7f SI, in Allen 1974, p. 187. Compare also the practice of painting the Sound Eye of Horus on the mummy's face in CT spell 936, in de Buck 1961, p. 138j-k and Faulkner 1978, p. 71. Alternatively, the act of painting Maat on the tongue could imply the consumption of the goddess to produce the same result. Compare CT spell 1017: \"I have eaten Maat, I have swallowed Magic (h.k?)\"; in de Buck 1961, p. 238d-e and Faulkner 1978, p. 118. See further under \"magical swallowing,\" below. 420.

As noted above, the air god Shu was the first product of the creator's spittle, and Amon is expressly said to have \"spat out the wind (?Vw).\"424 The notion of transferring invigorating breath is a commonplace in offering rituals, which promise the donor the \"breath of life\" (_tw ilh),425 and funerary texts recognize the same technique, particularly emphasized in variants of the late \"Books of Breathing\": 0 ba, breathing upon his feet, he begins to go in peace over every land.426 The treatment here envisioned for the resuscitated corpse would later be applied to the gout-stricken patient. CONTINUITY AND CHRISTIANIZATION Neither Roman sanctions nor conversion to Christianity resulted in the suppression of traditional magical techniques.427 Numerous papyri inscribed in Demotic and Greek testify to the endurance of Egyptian practice during the Roman and Christian centuries,428 and previously quoted examples furnish ample demonstration of the survival of native concepts regarding the magical applications of spittle. The circulation of such texts in Greek translation, and the wanderings of magicians themselves, exported Egyptian notions throughout the Mediterranean, where pre-existing local conceptions will have been influenced or strengthened. The common presence of \"saliva magic\" in surrounding areas makes any evaluation of influence difficult, however, and thus it is unclear whether 423.

In contrast to New Testament ritual, Old Testament references stressed the negative associations of spittle, which was seen as a symbol of madness (1 Kings 21:13) and worthlessness (Isaiah 40:15), and as a source or transmitter of impurity (Leviticus 15:8). Such common negative associations reappear in Coptic extra-biblical literature, where spitting is typically linked with raging men, camels, and demons,431 and the practice is condemned for defiling ritual purity: [Priests] shall not put sandals on their feet when they go into the church, nor shall they spit in the sanctuary.432 This very prohibition motivated the thirtieth wonder of the Arabic \"Life of Saint Pisentius,\" in which a careless priest is struck dead for spitting before the altar. The priest had unwittingly struck the wing of one of the invisible cherubim, and the angel retaliated by inflicting paralysis and death.433 Spitting at pagan deities is altogether another matter, however, and Samuel of Kalamun is praised for spitting at the rising sun during the religious services of his Berber master.434 429. The difficulty is made almost insurmountable by mutual influence in ritual matters extending back for millennia. For the incident with Vespasian, see Spitting to cure eye injury has traditional precedent in Egypt, following Thoth's cure of the Eye of Horus (PT spell 214, \u00a7141d-42d); see above n. 358. As noted in the second satire of Persius, spitting was also a common Roman practice to repel the Evil Eye; for further Roman sources and discussion, see n. 325, above. 430. For the miracles in which Jesus cures blindness and dumbness by spitting on the eyes and tongue, see pp. John and for Egyptian influence, see Morton Smith 1978, pp. 48 and 58. 431.

The saint was barred from further attendance.90 oi.uchicago.eduSPITTING, LICKING, AND SWALLOWING Despite such negative connotations of spitting, the old notion of healing saliva remained, given new justification by the miracles of Jesus. Evoking earlier praise of Thoth, one text declares that \"the spittle in His mouth is healing salve,\"435 while a spell for exorcism invokes Gabriel by \"the spit that came forth from the Father's mouth and became a well of water of life.\"436 One of the more repellent episodes in Coptic hagiography finds its motivation precisely in the pointed contrast between common notions of spittle as corruption and magical concepts of curative saliva. The final days of the archimandrite Apollo produced the following \"mystery of the faith\": He fell into a great illness when his inward parts were stricken, and thereafter he continued to spit blood and phlegm for the rest of his days. So he was sick in this fashion, but his sickness was also a healing for others. For while he was sitting one day speaking with believers who had come to him to be blessed by him, there was one among them, too, who was suffering from a sickness. 0 that spittle that issued from the saint's mouth! O the sickness that became the healer of another's sickness! For the sickness constrained our father to expectorate such things. It is holy spittle, one might say. At once when it dropped upon the ground, the sick man took it in perfect hope and swallowed it. And suddenly the grace of faith became the healing of the believer through that holy spittle. And so the man was healed.437 The nadir of this technique is found in the Ethiopic life of Takla Haw~ry~t, in which the saint lunges forward to consume an expectorated piece of communion bread, which transmits healing as \"the body of Christ.\"438 In all such tales, holy spittle now functions as a \"bodily relic,\" deriving its power from divinity inherent in the saintly figure. The same notions of indwelling divinity had sanctified the fluids of the ancient gods, but the veneration of human saints made such materials more accessible. Comparable wonders are obtained by consuming dirt from the saint's feet or water used to wash his corpse,439 and even by salving bodily sores with the pulp of saints freshly ground between millstones.440 435.

The existence of similar beliefs in foreign cultures in no way invalidates the significance of the concept within Egyptian thought,443 and the complexity of native phenomena has been little illuminated by the reductionistic categories of \"folk medicine,\" \"homeopathic\" or \"contagious\" magic.444 Nor should these spitting practices be classed as subreligious \"superstition,\" since in each case they are direct expressions of orthodox theological concepts, following the precedents of religious leaders whether gods, kings, emperors, or prophets. LICKING If spitting serves as an all but universal ritual practice, the related technique of licking is more rarely encountered. In Egyptian magical methodology, the term \"licking\" (nsb, '- J )445 is accorded seemingly unique status, appearing commonly as a technical expression for spell manipulation. In so far as the action is but a variant of spitting in the physical transfer of saliva, the underlying \"mechanics\" should be understood similarly. Like spitting, also, the practice may encompass a variety of meanings, ranging from curative to cursing. Egyptian references to \"magical licking\" have received little scholarly attention, however, and a survey of examples is thus necessary to establish the traditional patterns.446 Funerary literature again provides the most plentiful source for this magical technique, which serves a variety of purposes already in the Pyramid Texts. In the offering rituals of 441. Zibelius 1984b, p. 400. 442. Wissa Wassef 1971, p. 250. 443. Compare n. 309, above.

While such negative usage of licking is attested and is discussed below, it would seem that these passages refer instead to the healing of Horus's eye by the gods, so that the king is presented with the \"Sound Eye of Horus.\" Elsewhere, the restoration of the eye is attributed to the curative force of divine saliva, and \"licking\" would here parallel \"spitting\" as a \"medico-magical\" technique.449 As previously noted, the \"magical\" transfer of health or blessing by saliva reflects such \"naturally\" observable phenomena as the licking of wounds. As a magical technique, licking represents a ritualized extension of such instinctive acts. Natural observation certainly underlies the licking imagery associated with the cow goddess Hathor. Like a cow with her calf,450 the goddess \"licks Horus whom she has borne,\"451 and bestows her blessing on Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari in the same manner: \"kissing your hand, licking your limbs, endowing your Majesty with life and dominion.\"452 The goddess' kiss in the form of a lick charges the recipient with renewed life: I kiss your hand, I lick your limbs with my pleasant tongue which has come forth from my mouth, you being born daily on the hands of your father Amon.453 This blessing of Hathor may be extended to the deceased in funerary contexts; a vignette from the Book of the Dead of T?-nfr\" depicts the goddess licking the man's hand to ensure his rebirth.454 The healing kiss of Hathor is still evoked at the Ptolemaic temple of Edfu, where the goddess appears before Horus: \"She has licked the injury that is in your 447.

When his cloak was licked by the Apis, Eudoxus was informed by the priests that his fame would be great, but that his life would be short.456 He had, in effect, acquired certain qualities of Osiris, transmitted by the god's earthly representative, the Apis. Therapeutic licking is performed by human practitioners as well. In Coffin Texts spell 81, the practitioner identifies himself with the god Shu to ensure that his \"flesh is alive,\" and his limbs \"nourished.\" The spell is recited over images of the Ogdoad painted on the hand in yellow pigment and Nubian ochre \"to be licked off every day very early.\"457 In his translation of this text, Faulkner is perplexed by the wording, since \"it seems unlikely that the hands of the deceased are to be ochred.\"458 Moreover, he modifies the translation of \"licked\" to \"rinsed(?),\" since \"it does not seem at all probable that actual licking was intended.\"459 There is, however, nothing unusual about this spell, which accords with practice common in the non-funerary \"magical\" literature. Like much of the supposedly \"funerary\" corpus, this text was certainly devised for use by the living, and its directions should be understood literally.46\u00b0) Daily licking of the hand restores the ritualist's flesh, and echoes the mythological passage in the spell wherein Shu boasts that the sun god Atum \"kissed me every day.\" Such a solar blessing may be expressly equated with licking, as in Coffin Texts spell 1053: \"1 am the Lord of the Horizon, and the daily flame licks me.\"461 Variants state \"Khepri shines and licks me,\" reinforcing the association of solar \"licking\" with the rays of early dawn.462 455.

Papyrus Turin 54003, an early Twelfth Dynasty manuscript containing older spells from the First Intermediate Period, includes among its ophthalmological recipes the following: My eyes are opened by the Great One; My eyes are opened by the Opener; The Eyes [of Hathor] are opened in the House of the Statue; The Eyes of Hathor are opened in the [House of] Gold, that she might look at that red [...]-animal(?) when he opens his mouth, when he opens his jaws(?), when he looks at that pupil of gold, faience, quartz, and carnelian which flourishes (literally 'grows') on the eye of the majesty of Ptah. When Isis bent over it, she licked it; When I bent over my eye, I licked it. From this my face, from this my eye, I dispelled the blow of a god, goddess, dead man, or dead woman. Dispelled is the obscurity, being thoroughly stripped away. As Shu has licked what was done to him, so Maat(?) has licked what was done to her. To be said by a man as he puts water into his eyes.463 Emulating divine prototypes, the human reciter restores his injured vision by figuratively \"licking\" his own eye through the administration of \"eyedrops.\" Such an eye cure by lick- ing supports the similar interpretation of Pyramid Texts spell 166 and 181, discussed above. From the end of the Middle Kingdom, a literal example of protective licking appears within the collection of priestly papyri discovered beneath the Ramesseum (late Twelfth Dynasty to Thirteenth Dynasty). The rubric of the fragmentary Papyrus Ramesseum 14 stipulates: on ... fresh ... It should be licked off (nsb) by a man.\"464 The therapeutic licking of spells and images drawn on the hand continues in Ramesside magical manuals. The best-known example accompanies the anti-scorpion spell of Papyrus Turin 1993, \"The Legend of Isis and the Secret Name of Re,\"465 This extensive spell concludes: Words to be recited over an image of Atum and of Horus-of-Praise, a figure of Isis, and an image of Horus, drawn (on) the hand of the sufferer and licked off by the man; do likewise on a strip of fine linen, placed on the sufferer at his throat. Its plant is scorpion plant. Or ground up with beer or wine, it is drunk by the man who has a scorpion sting. It is what kills the poison-truly effective, (proved) a million times.466 463. Verso 2-8.

Such \"consumption\" of written spells is discussed in greater detail below. Even where complemented by notions of \"swallowing,\" however, the curative function of licking probably still finds its basis in the simple licking of wounds. This is expressed clearly within a third century Demotic remedy for wound treatment, which yet retains the old methodology. Papyrus London and Leiden, col. 20, 11. 1-27, a spell to cure scorpion sting, begins with an historiola directed to the wound itself, detailing the injury of Anubis and his subsequent cure by Isis. In the mythological recitation, Isis instructs Anubis: Lick from your tongue to your heart and vise versa, up to the edges of the wound! Lick to the edges of the wound up to the limits of your strength! What you shall lick, you shall swallow. Do not spit it out on the ground, for your tongue is the tongue of Shay (Fate); your tongue is that of Atum.468 The spells' directions then instruct the practitioner regarding his own wound: \"And you should immediately lick it with your tongue while it is bleeding.\"469 The patient, assimilated to Anubis, is thus depicted as a dog licking his wounds. The spell concludes with the topical application of enchanted oil. The two incantations which bracket the spell are each designed to \"charge\" fluids with curative power: the flowing blood that is lapped and the oil that is applied. As in Papyrus Turin 1993, the healing spell is rendered tangible, and administered both internally and externally. A further significant feature which links this spell to Papyrus Turin 1993 and the yet earlier Coffin Texts spell 81 is the specific mention of the god Atum, whose kiss, lick, or tongue is invoked within each recitation. Such mentions are clearly motivated by the mythological significance of the god's creative saliva. By association with this creator deity, the lick bestowed by the practitioner acquires generative force, exactly paralleling the use of \"healing spittle.\" As spittle may be both \"healing\" and \"corruptive,\" so licking may also acquire hostile or dangerous overtones. In \"The Cannibal Hymn\" of the Pyramid Texts (spells 273-74), the king is said to be \"disgusted when he licks the emetics which are in the Red Crown.\"470 467. Compare the snake venom remedies to \"open the throat\" and thus prevent constriction of breathing, discussed in Sauneron 1989, pp. 179 and 186. 468.

Faulkner (1969. pp. 82 and 84, n. 24) does not translate sbiw, \"emetics.\"96 oi.uchicago.eduSPITTING, LICKING, AND SWALLOWING The hymn poses a contrast between the repellent licking of the emetics, and the resultant joyful possession of their power. The importance of emetics (sbs.w) as snake venom remedies is noted above. Here licking is again related to swallowing,471 but with hostile intent; the king consumes the emetics of the crown just as he devours the hearts and lungs of the gods. Snake remedies provide yet a further link between negative instances of spitting, licking, and swallowing. In the recitation against serpents of Pyramid Texts spell 228, it is stated: \"it has swallowed for itself that which it has licked.\" Though this passage has been justly described as obscure,472 it would seem that the term licking is used here to describe the method by which a serpent emits its venom, paralleling the common use of \"spitting\" imagery found elsewhere in the Pyramid Texts.473 As in these other spells, the intent of the recitation is to make the venom recoil upon the snake itself,474 so that the hostile reptile is forced to \"swallow for itself' the poison that it has ejected by licking. This interpretation is confirmed by a Middle Kingdom spell against the Rerek-serpent carved on a stone box in the Louvre (inv. E 25485).475 Within the spell, the serpent is directly addressed as: \"licker who has come forth from the cavern! You have swallowed the eye of Re, you have licked the eye of Baba.\"476 As the serpent is later styled the \"son of Baba\" (literally \"hole-inhabitant\"?),477 the reptile is thus told that he has attacked his own father while attacking Re.478 An ironic echo of this legend may survive in the late Papyrus Jumilhac, in which Baba attempts to slander Thoth by declaring that \"it is Thoth who has taken what belonged to Re, who has eaten Re, his abomination. He has licked what came forth from him.\"479 471. As recognized by Wh 2: 334/11. The magical force of the emetics is next described as being in the king's belly. Faulkner 1969, p. 84, n. 25, misattributes this force to the \"hearts\" mentioned in \u00a7410c. 472. Borghouts 1984, p. 704, n. 5. 473. See nn. 397-400, above. \"Licking\" is not infrequently associated with serpents; compare the Greek usage of X At a, in Liddell, Scott, and Jones 1940, p. 1055a. 474. See n. 402, above. 475. Borghouts 1984, pp. 704-16. 476. Ibid., pp. 703-04. The reference to swallowing and licking the eyes of Re and Baba is later repeated in the spell (p. 705). 477. Ibid., p. 705, n. 14.

Vandier (1961, p. 128, col. 16/12-13) provides a differing translation. The false accusation of eating a portion of Re is expressed by a euphemistic circumlocution, inserting the phrase \"the enemies of\" before the god's name (Posener 1969, p. 35); for the continued use of this formula, see Quack 1989. Vandier, following a suggestion of Posener, read the word \"enemies\" as \"repast/food\" (p. 195, n. 534).97 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE In the Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead, hostile licking of spells appears as a threat to the deceased: As for any god, goddess, spirit, dead man, or dead woman, who shall lick off his spell against me today, he shall fall to the execution blocks, to the magic that is in my body, the terrible flames that are in my mouth.480 Food offerings are all around me through the \"Effective Eye\" that licks/burns up (nsb) any male or female dead who shall come opposing me.481 Back, O (crocodile) who is in the West, for there is a n 'w-serpent in this my belly. I shall not be given to you; you shall not lick off my spell.482 As for any god or dead man who shall lick off his spell in my presence on this day, he shall fall to the depths.483 Such underworld references play upon the associations of licking with both serpents and \"tongues of fire\"; the notions are conjoined in the persons of fire-licking serpent guardian genii.484 Protective use of hostile licking is also notable in this religious literature. In the later \"Glorifications of Osiris,\" the deceased is told: Your tongue has been assembled as the One who guides the Two Lands, so that it might lick against (nsb r) your enemies.485 480.

A Demotic example of curative licking is already cited above, and a further instance appears within a revelation ritual (ph-nr) designed to elicit a direct vision of the healing god Imhotep. In Papyrus Louvre E 3229, col. 7, the god is summoned by the traditional method of licking a formula inscribed on the hand (1. 10).487 The text then instructs the ritualist: You should open your mouth to the ground in a cry saying: [...] 'The Sound Eye, the Sound Eye is what I ate.' You should open your mouth to it in order to lick it (or 'when he has licked'). Awake at dawn. You should say: 'Horus is my name. I am Horus the triumphant.'488 The surrounding context is fragmentary, and varying interpretations of the ritual scenario are possible. Nonetheless, the recited spell does allude to the injury and restoration of the Sound Eye of the god Horus, who is proclaimed \"triumphant\" at its conclusion. Given the bivalent qualities of ceremonial licking and swallowing, however, it is unclear whether \"eating\" the Sound Eye is to be seen as a hostile reenactment of its injury, or as a positive reference to ingesting its efficacy.489 Correspondingly, licking could be either the physical enactment of the proclaimed consumption, or a remedy for it. The ritual employment of licking is found in several of the Egyptian magical manuals preserved in the Greek language, and is but one of many indications of the inherently 486. See Wb 5: 7/14-15 and the corresponding Wh Beleg. 5: 2 (Kom Ombo and Thebes). The idiom properly suggests \"spitting\" (q () with the tongue. 487. J. H. Johnson 1977, p. 73 and 1986e, p. 329. Though the passage is broken, the reference to licking is clear, and the feminine antecedent should refer to \"your hand,\" mentioned in the same line. The text is to be written with myrrh ink. 488. Column 7/11-13 in J. H. Johnson 1977, pp. 73-74 and 1986e, p. 329. The word \"lick\" (nsb) is partially broken in 1. 12, but certain. Less certain is the translation of the final clause in the line, which is written iw ns[b]f and understood by the editor as a writing of r nsbhf, \"in order to lick it.\" Within the sen- tence, however, the pronouns translated \"it\" do not agree in gender; the mouth is opened to an object with a feminine antecedent (r-r s), while the pronoun following \"lick\" is masculine (f). The anteced- ents may be the \"hand\" (fem.) and \"head\" (masc.) mentioned in the adjacent broken passages. 489. Compare the \"negative\" and \"positive\" consumption of the Eye in CT spell 935: \"O NN, I give to you the lesser Eye of Horus, of which Seth ate. O NN, I give to you the Eye of Horus by which your mouth is opened. The pupil that is in the Eye of Horus, eat it. O NN, I give to you the Eye of Horus and you will not be ill(?)\"; in de Buck 1961, p. 136 and Faulkner 1978, p. 70.99 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE traditional Egyptian basis of most PGM (Papyri Graecae Magicae) ritual.490 In PGM IV, the so-called \"Mithras Liturgy,\" a spell for a direct revelation incorporates the old mechanism of licking an inscribed magical name so that its power is absorbed. Write on a leaf of the persea tree the eight lettered name, as given below. And having kept yourself pure for 3 days in advance, come at morning to face the sunrise; lick off the leaf while you show it to the sun, and then he [the sun god] will listen to you attentively ... Now this is the name: \"IEE OO IAI.\" Lick this up so that you may be protected.491 As in Coffin Texts spell 81, approximately two and one half millennia earlier, the licking is performed before the rising sun to elicit the god's favor. Another revelation text in PGM VII expressly combines the related actions of licking and swallowing to achieve the same purpose. Write the name in myrrh ink on two male eggs. Regarding one, you are to cleanse yourself thoroughly; then lick off the name, break it, and throw it away. Hold the other in your partially open right hand and show it to the sun at dawn ... Then speak the formula 7 times, crack the egg open, and swallow its contents. 492 Recalling Ramesside practice in Papyrus Turin 1993, licking and swallowing are here associated as complementary means of internalizing divine force. In PGM XIII (Papyrus Leiden I 395), the traditional methodology occurs in no fewer than five procedures, entailing the licking of inscribed natron plaques, gold lamellae, and leaves. Three of these instances are found in textual variants of the revelation spell known as \"The Eighth Book of Moses,\" a composition otherwise dependent upon contemporary Egyptian temple cosmologies.493 490. Licking is occasionally accorded magical force in Greece; two similar mythological examples are mentioned in Halliday 1967, p. 83 (snakes lick the ears of future prophets, who thereby obtain the ability to understand the language of birds). For the relationship between the Greek and native Egyptian spells, see Ritner 1995. 491. Licking appears in 11. 785 and 789 (Preisendanz 1928, pp. 98-100 and M. W. Meyer 1986, p. 53). The inscription of a sacred name on the persea leaf recalls Thoth's use of the leaves of the ished-tree, often identified with the persea, for inscribing the names of kings. 492. The mention of licking is found in 1. 522 (Preisendanz 1931, p. 24; and H. Martin 1986, p. 132). The term \"male eggs\" signifies eggs which will hatch a male offspring (see the discussion by H. Martin ibid., p. 132). 493. Sauneron and 1962b, pp. 268-69. The rite also takes place within an initiation tent (11. 98, 210, 566, and 652). For the use of tents (as recreations of the sky vault in rites for visions), see BD spells 148 (Twenty-first dynasty) \u00a7P7 and 190 \u00a7P7, in Allen 1974, pp. 141 and 214 (for initiation) and cf. E. Brugsch 1889. The tent is labeled an \"unexplained residuum\" of a mystery rite by Morton Smith 1986, p. 174, n. 24. Contra O'Neil 1986, p. 72, no mention of a tent is found in PGM IV, 11. 1949-50, where the term acfvo; signifies \"corpse.\"100 oi.uchicago.eduSPITTING, LICKING, AND SWALLOWING Have present a mixing bowl containing milk of a black cow and wine not mixed with sea water, for this is the beginning and end. Then, having written the (text of) the stela on the two faces of the natron plaque, lick off the one side, and pouring upon the other, wash it off into the mixing bowl ... Then, before you drink off the milk and wine, say over it this petition.494 This standard combination of licking and swallowing a soluble inscription figures prominently in all three versions; there is no need to assume, with Morton Smith, that the techniques are a later insertion.495 The contrasting symbolism of washing is resumed in a 494. PGM XIII, 11. 128-36. The prohibition of sea water derives from its association with Seth, as noted above. The three versions of \"The Eighth Book of Moses\" comprise: Text A, 11. 1-230 (licking in I. 132, in Preisendanz 1931, p. 93 and Morton Smith 1986, p. 175); Text B, II. 343-618 (licking in .434, in Preisendanz 1931, p. 109 and Morton Smith 1986, p. 184); and Text C, II. 646-734 (licking in 1. 690, in Preisendanz 1931, p. 118 and Morton Smith 1986, p. 188). 495. Morton Smith 1984. Smith's hypothetical source criticism appears on pp. 687-88. Despite abridgments or reordering of sections, the texts yield a largely consistent ritual order for the licking procedure: recitation of the natron stela inconsistencies between the variants (Betz 1986, p. 184, n. 90) conflates the petition of the hour gods with the Hermetic spell. Smith (1984, p. 687) is disturbed by the appearance of the angel intercessor toward the conclusion of B, following the deferred description of the invocation to be written on the natron stela: \"to have an angel come at the end of the first invocation and anticipate the god's revelation is structurally anticlimactic and only to be explained by the supposition that there was an earlier, simpler form which used only one invocation, after which, without any licking, drinking, or repetition, the revelation would occur.\" Despite Smith's discomfort with such an \"anticlimax,\" the appearance of divine intermediaries prior to the main revelation is well attested; compare Pap. London and Leiden, cols. 1/1-3/35, using Anubis (J. H. Johnson 1986c, pp. 195-200). Nor does the deferred placement of the natron text imply that it was originally only a terminal, spoken spell. Its proper position within the ritual is clearly stated (II. 424-25 and 430), and similar deferral of technical subsections is common in magical texts; cf. the ritual of Pap. London and Leiden, col. 5/1-33 (J. H. Johnson 1986c, pp. 201-03), which appends both its initial invocation and its ointment recipe. Smith's suggestion of an original, simplified version is a non sequitur. Given the great antiquity of the magical techniques of licking and swallowing, it is hardly accurate to suggest that \"when the notion came in that the magician must get the prayer inside him before he could utter it, the original form was changed ...\" (Smith 1984, pp. 687- 88). This notion had \"come in\" long before \"The Eighth Book of Moses\" was ever composed.101 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE later prayer, in which the divinity is requested to \"wash off from me the evils of fate.\"496 An appended revelation procedure for protection and power again recalls Papyrus Turin 1993 in its pairing of amulet and licking. It is to the suns (scil. dawn, midday, and sunset) of the thirteenth day of the month that one should complete this initiation of the gold lamella, which is licked off and over which one recites: 'IAIA ...' At the initiation, this is said six times with everything else. One writes the 7 vowels on the gold lamella for licking off, and the 7 vowels on the silver one for the phylactery.497 A final example in the papyrus occurs in a spell to repel fear and anger, and entails the standard solar blessing and amulet. Take a laurel leaf, and write the characters on it thus. Having shown it to the sun, say: 'I call on you ...' When you have said this three times, lick off the leaf, and keep the lamella with you.498 The choice of laurel leaf betrays Greek cultural influence, but the procedure is otherwise canonically Egyptian. This native procedure has now been followed through three millennia, from the Pyramid Texts through the Roman era, and its patterns of ceremonial employment are clear. Where licking serves primarily to transfer saliva, it is but a variant of ritual spitting, and may be construed as a blessing, a cure, or a curse. Where licking serves primarily as a means of consumption, however, it is but a variant of ritual swallowing, employed either to ingest divine force, or to devour hostile figures. SWALLOWING The rationale for the technique of magical swallowing is intuitively obvious, being derived by analogic reasoning from the mundane act of eating. Seen strictly from the perspective of actions, there are no distinctions among the simple \"physical\" swallowing of 496. Text B, I. 613 and cf. Text C, 1. 713, in Preisendanz 1931, pp. 116 and 119 and Morton Smith 1986, pp. 187 and 189. Washing (to repel a trait) is here the functional opposite of licking (to absorb a trait). With this technique of \"removal\" by washing, compare the wiping off of a spell or image drawn on the hand to terminate a vision in two dream oracles of Bes: PGM VII, 1I. 222-49 and initiate such a revelation, one might instead lick the image, as in Pap. Louvre E 3229, col. 7, discussed above. For the contrast between licking and wiping, see BD spell 32, Twenty-first Dynasty, b \u00a7S I, in Allen 1974, p. 43 (the crocodile of the North cannot lick off a spell, since it has been wiped dry). 497. References to licking are found in 11. 889-90 and 897, in Preisendanz 1931, p. 126 and Morton Smith 1986, p. 192. 498. Licking is mentioned in 1. 1051, in Preisendanz 1931, p. 130 and Morton Smith 1986, p. 195. The inscription on the lamella includes the mention of \"Ptah, O Health\" (transcribed from Egyptian as PHTHA PHOOZA).102 oi.uchicago.eduSPITTING, LICKING, AND SWALLOWING food for nourishment, the \"medical\" swallowing of dates, minerals, or prescriptions, and the \"magical\" swallowing of enchanted water or dissolved ink. Consumption entails the absorption of an object and the acquisition of its benefits or traits. Alternatively, the act can serve a principally hostile function, whereby \"to devour\" signifies \"to destroy\"-though even here the concept of acquiring power may be retained. The technique is interesting not for its explanation, but for its development.499 The bond between eating and ritual swallowing is made explicit throughout the offering rituals of the Pyramid Texts, where foodstuffs are often identified with the stolen Eye of Horus. By the implied swallowing of proffered bread, dates, wine, et cetera, the Eye is internalized and thus restored to the recipient's body.500 A similar notion of \"consuming\" Horus perhaps underlies Pyramid Texts spell 504: If he (scil. Re) is pleased with me, he will be pleased with Horus who is on his tongue(?); If he is pleased with Horus who is on his tongue(?), he will be pleased with me.501 The most famous expression of this general concept appears in the elaborate \"Cannibal Hymn\" (Pyramid Texts spells 273-74).502 The King is one who eats men and lives on the gods ... The King eats their magic, swallows their spirits: Their big ones are for his morning meal, Their middle ones are for his evening meal, Their little ones are for his night meal,... He has smashed bones and marrow, He has seized the hearts of the gods, ... The King feeds on the lungs of the wise, and likes to live on hearts and their magic.503 499. See the summary of \"magical swallowing\" in Ritner 1989b, pp. 106-08 and the brief remarks on ritual \"drinking\" and \"eating\" in Heerma van Voss 1984, pp. 31 and 33. 500. E.g., PT spells 43, 46, 51, 53, etc. Such rituals may be the ultimate inspiration for the Demotic recitation of Pap. Louvre E 3229, cited above, p. 99 and n. 488, in which the practitioner \"eats\" the Eye of Horus and thus becomes \"Horus the triumphant.\" Other rituals in the Pyramid Texts equate the food offering with the fluid of Osiris, milk of Isis, teeth of Horus, etc. In all such cases, the food transfers to the king the numinous qualities of its divine analog. The same technique could benefit hostile forces as well, and in PT spell 57K (\u00a740+11) the king is told to thwart the designs of Seth: \"take to yourself the Eye of Horus to prevent it from being consumed\" (Faulkner 1969, p. 12). 501. Sethe 1910, p. 101 (\u00a71088b-c); see Faulkner 1969, p. 180. Compare, however, the different interpre- tation suggested for an image of Maat painted on the tongue, above, p. 88 and n. 419. The translation of PT spell 504 here follows Faulkner, but the reference to ns, \"tongue,\" if correct, is surely a pun on ns, \"throne\" mentioned earlier (with proper determinative) in the same spell (Sethe 1901, p. 99 [\u00a71086cJ). 502.

Thus while in spell 612 the reciter may declare that \"I have swallowed the seven uraei,\"505 in spell 341 the rubric dictates the literal swallowing of seven Eyes of Horus: This spell is to be spoken over seven sketched Sound Eyes, dissolved in beer and natron and drunk by a man.506 By this technique, the practitioner directly fulfills the standard claims of having \"swallowed hk?,\" \"filled the body with hk?,\" or-in one instance-\"flooded the body with hk?.\"507 In the same corpus of spells appears perhaps the first instance of an increasingly common idiom expressly linking consumption with acquired familiarity, in which the terms \"to taste/taste\" (dp/dp.t) assume the nuance \"to experience/experience\": \"It goes well with every god of whom I have experience (literally \"whom I have tasted\").\"508 In the subsequent New Kingdom spells of the Book of the Dead, the imagery of \"eating\" and \"swallowing\" remains prominent, though the accompanying rubrics lack 504. References to swallowing and devouring (magic, gods, and demons) are pervasive, appearing inter alia in CT spells 30, 33-35, 36, 37, 239, 241, 650, 689, 1017 (magic eaten and drunk), 248 (\"1 eat the gods\"), 275 (Ennead swallowed), 285 ([as Sobek] \"I eat the Great One\"), 342 (hostile crocodile threatens to devour magic), 573 (cannibal hymn: \"To Eat the Magicians, All of Them\"), 839 (Seth eaten as bull), and 863 (dead swallowed). See Speleers 1947, p. 178, note to CT spell 30, \u00a790b. 505. De Buck 1956, p. 225k and Faulkner 1977, p. 199. 506. De Buck 1951, p. 345g-i and Faulkner 1973, p. 276. 507. For claims of the consumption of magic, see the examples in n. 504, above. The notion of bodies \"filled with magic\" is found already in PT spell 273, \u00a7397b: \"(The King) is one who eats their entrails, those who come with their bodies filled with magic\"; Sethe 1908, p. 207. The reference to \"flooding\" the body with ~hk? appears in CT spell 650; de Buck 1956, p. 272h and Faulkner 1977, p. 225. Not unreasonably, Faulkner takes the writing of mnh with water determinative as an error for the common rih, \"to fill.\" However, the scribe may well have intended exactly what he wrote (if only as a pun on the stereotyped phrase), as is shown both by the rubric to spell 341 and by references which equate \"filling\" with drinking: \"I have filled my body with Ihk?, I have quenched my thirst with it\"; CT spell 239, in de Buck 1947, p. 321e-f and Faulkner 1973, p. 188 (identical statement in CT spells 30, 33, 36, and 37). For the contrast between these conceptions and Zande mangu or so-called \"witchcraft,\" see n. 93 in Chapter 1, above. 508. CT spell 316, in de Buck 1951, p. 108i (and cf. p. 108e) and Faulkner 1973, pp. 239-40, with nn. 30 and 33.

Contra Klasens, the idiom need not always be unfavorable, as is shown by CT spell 316. An unrecognized example is found in the \"Satire on the Trades\" (Dw?-ifty), \u00a76, 1: \"I mention to you likewise the mason; painful is his experience (usually translated \"loins\")\" (Helck 1970, pp. 59 and 63 and Lichtheim 1973, p. 187). The same phrase appears in \u00a77 (Helck 1970, pp. 78 and 82-83).104 oi.uchicago.eduSPITTING, LICKING, AND SWALLOWING specific references to ritual consumption.509 Nonetheless, the mention of swallowing gods \"as a potion for death\" directly reflects contemporary medical practice, in which prescriptions and fluids were first \"charged\" with divine force by spells and then swallowed by the patient.510 The best known example of such a recitation is the generic \"Spell for Drinking a Remedy\" found near the beginning of the Ebers Papyrus: Come, remedy! Come, that which dispels what is in this my heart and in these my limbs! Magic (ik?) has power over a remedy, and vise-versa! Do you remember that Horus was taken together with Seth to the great palace of Heliopolis when one negotiated regarding the testicles of Seth with Horus? Thus he will be healthy like one who is on earth; he does all that he desires like one who is there (scil. 'in the underworld'). Recite when drinking a remedy. Truly effective-(proved) millions of times.511 The same practice has already been noted in the ritual of the rather literary Papyrus Turin 1993, in which scorpion poison is neutralized by reciting a lengthy historiola over drawn images and scorpion plant, ground up with beer or wine and drunk by the victim.512 The motif enters literature directly in the \"Tale of the Two Brothers,\" wherein the protagonist Bata is miraculously revived when his excised and desiccated heart swallows water and is in turn swallowed by the lifeless hero. These miracles by which Bata \"took in\" (literally \"swallowed\") the condition of life were themselves preceded by miracles whereby the hero's brother \"took in\" or \"comprehended\" (literally \"swallowed\") The pun is legitimate, for-in a semantic recognition of a magical principle- 509.

At its conclusion, Bata is again reborn by this technique when the king's favorite becomes pregnant with the hero after swallowing a chip of wood-paralleling the \"pregnancy\" of Seth in the tale of \"Horus and Seth.\" See Gardiner 1932, pp. Coptic period, this verb (as effectively supplanted the traditional verb of \"knowing\" (rh).515 If the magical connotations of \"swallowing\" are both obvious and widely invoked, this yet constitutes a specifically Egyptian development, standing in marked contrast to English and American usage, in which \"gullibility\" or \"swallowing\" signifies not intimate knowledge, but foolish belief. While the equation of \"swallowing\" and \"knowing\" may be present in the Book of the Dead,516 it is certainly in evidence in the royal \"Book of the Heavenly Cow,\" which pairs the verbs r and 'm in parallel phrases when the sun god Re warns against the potential power of magicians \"using the magic (zk.w) which is in their bodies\": Moreover, guard against those magicians who know (rh) their spells, since the god Heka is in them himself. Now as for the one who ingests/knows ('\"m) him, I am there.517 From the New Kingdom also derive the earliest attestations of a new genre of curative and apotropaic stelae, vanquishing the terrors of the river and desert as embodied by crocodiles, snakes, scorpions, lions, and gazelles.518 Often styled \"Horus on the Crocodiles\" after their most common feature, these stelae may be traced from the Eighteenth Dynasty through the Roman era, with survivals among Byzantine Christian amulets as well.519 Typically, these stelae depict the youthful god Horus standing atop (and thus trampling)520 two or more crocodiles, while firmly grasping in each hand an assortment of noxious animals suspended 514.

The popularity of the stelae extended from court to commoner, with larger examples erected before temple compounds as public benefactions for the cure of animal bite. Such community stelae were often incorporated within \"healing statues\" that depicted a cippus clasped by the donor, whose image was virtually blanketed with protective spells. Despite the standard presence of these curative texts, the primary method of utilizing the stelae and statues involved not reading, but ingested water. Water poured over the stela or statue absorbed the efficacy of the spells and images and was subsequently drunk by the sufferer. Smaller, portable cippi may have been immersed in bowls of water, but larger healing stat- ues and stelae were provided with shallow basins to collect this curative water, and similar receptacles are indicated at a healing shrine at Karnak by the remains of inset basins, con- duits, and jars.522 This association is particularly obvious on a little-known cippus example in Cairo, carved directly on the side of a stone vase, 523 while the texts of the Tyszkiewickz healing statue in the Louvre explicitly designate the patient as \"this man who drinks this water.\"524 The water's restorative function may well be twofold on donated stelae- serving both as medicine for the patient and as a libation for the spirit of the donor.525 Late association of consumption with knowledge extends well beyond the common use of cippi. Thus, the theological proclamations of the coffin of Ankhnesneferibre, daughter of Psammetichus II and God's Wife of Amon, include an address to deified \"Perception\" (Sia) as \"the Great Swallower.\"526 Demotic references to the technique of magical swallowing are among the most significant attestations of this long-standing native practice. The semantic pairing of \"eating\" and \"knowing\" surfaces even in a legal document of the Ptolemaic period,527 and from the same era derives the most explicit Egyptian description of the magical procedure.

I was speaking with regard to my elder brother Naneferkaptah, who is a good scribe and a very wise man. He caused that a new sheet of papyrus be brought before him. He wrote down every word that was on the papyrus, completely. He burned it with fire; he dissolved it with water. He recognized that it had dissolved; he drank it and he knew that which was in it.528 In the succeeding Roman era, the second tale of Setna revives the terminology of the Coffin Texts by describing a powerful Nubian magician as \"swallowing magic.\"529 Actual swallowing of \"magical potions\" remained a commonplace, and specific recipes for such philters are found throughout the Demotic magical corpus.530 The same praxis is adopted in Egyptian magical texts redacted in the Greek language. Coupled with ritual licking, the methodology has already been noted in PGM VII (third to fourth centuries) and in recurrent variants throughout PGM XIII (fourth century).531 As an independent action in the latter papyrus, the eating of drawn figures constitutes a preliminary \"initiation\" (scil. \"intimate knowledge and control\") of the ruling decans who determine the success of the larger procedure: 528.

The incident is related by, but not of, Setna's son, Si-Osire; one must correct the attribution in Ritner 1989b, p. 107. 530. Compare the potions using a divinized (drowned) shrewmouse in Pap.

And when you have censed them, eat them while saying the spell for the gods of the hours ... and you will have been initiated to them.532 In the subsequent century, PGM CI (fifth century) conjures by the power of the blood drunk by Seth,533 while the yet later PGM C (fifth to sixth centuries) continues the traditional practice of dissolving spells (&it6uaov), while invoking the newly-fashionable name of Christ.534 The Mosaic adultery curse in Numbers 5:11-31 had already given early Christians a legal precedent for ritual use of liquids charged with the force of a spell.535 Ascribed to God's commands to Moses, this test of female fidelity was sworn over an earthenware bowl filled with clean \"water of contention,\" in which had been dissolved one-tenth of an ephah (< Egyptian oipe-measure) of barley meal (\"the grain-offering of jealousy\"), sacred dust from the Tabernacle floor, and the ink-written words of a curse washed from a scroll by a priest: The priest shall write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the water of contention; he shall make the woman drink the water that brings out the truth, and the water shall enter her body.536 Should the swearer prove adulterous, the ingested curse is activated, and illicit pregnancy is terminated by miscarriage or untimely birth. While this procedure seems most at home among Egyptian practices conventionally termed \"magical,\" its canonization within Hebrew scripture well illustrates the arbitrary and capricious nature of the \"religion\" versus \"magic\" dichotomy.

Heterodox Christianity was no less influenced by the ancient technique, and the Gnostic topos of \"drinking down knowledge\" clearly reflects the Egyptian conception here traced from its earliest sources.540 The technique easily survived the Arabic conquest as well, and continues to the present in the common folk custom of drinking curative powder scraped from ancient temple walls.541 537. The obvious affiliation of this \"ordeal\" with general concepts of \"magic\" necessitated the remarks of Brichto (1975, p. 65), who defends this law from the accusation of \"magic\" because the ultimate actor is said to be God. The ultimate actor of all Egyptian \"magic\" is similarly God (Heka). Frymer-Kensky (1984, p. 25) also attempts to impart a moral basis to this ritual, yet concedes that the potion of Numbers 5 should be classified among \"ritual, symbolic or 'magical' actions which effectuate the oath.\" 538.

Roman Period Clay Figurine (Louvre inv. E 27145). No discussion of the rites of magic can fail to consider what is perhaps its most universally recognized practice: the manipulation of images. Readily familiar as a mainstay of medieval European sorcery (and numerous Hollywood movies), the ubiquitous \"voodoo doll\"542 provides a perfect embodiment of our working definition of magic as action which ignores the ordinary laws of \"cause and effect.\" The principles of the act are well known and intuitively obvious; punishment inflicted upon the doll (by pins, etc.) 542. The popular association of the \"voodoo doll\" with Haiti is actually erroneous; see W. Davis 1985, p. 208.6000 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES produces an analogous result upon the victim with whom it is identified (by attached personal effects, name, etc.). The existence of an identical practice in Egypt is documented by numerous examples, the most striking of which is a clay figurine in the Louvre of a bound female pierced by thirteen nails (see fig. 2) which was found near Antinoopolis in a clay vase with an inscribed lead plate, or lamella.543 Both the figure and its accompanying Greek inscription correspond directly to a procedure described in the great magical papyrus preserved in the Bibliothbque Nationale of Paris (PGM IV, 11. 296-466) in which the magician is instructed as follows: Take wax (or clay) from a potter's wheel and make two figures, a male and a female. Make the male in the form of Ares, fully armed, holding a sword in his left hand and threatening to plunge it into the right side of her neck. And make her with her arms behind her back and down on her knees. And you are to attach the 'personal effects' (ouota) to her head or neck ... And take thirteen copper needles and stick one in the brain while saying, 'I am piercing your brain, NN'; and stick 2 in the ears and 2 in the eyes and I in the mouth and 2 in the midriff and I in the hands and 2 in the sexual organs and 2 in the soles, saying each time, 'I am piercing such and such a member of her, NN, so that she may remember no one but me, NN, alone.'544 Despite the Greek language of the text, the intrusive appearance of Ares, and the Roman date (third to fourth centuries) of both papyrus and figurine, the rite here described is not of Greek origin, but instead represents the culmination of an indigenous Egyptian tradition whose origins are contemporary with the creation of Egyptian civilization itself. The posture and material of the female figurine, and even the detailed attitude of the missing Ares figure, attest to the millennia old tradition from which they derive. To trace the development of this tradition, and the position of the Louvre figurine within it, one must first examine the techniques not of private but of royal magic, attested from the earliest remains of ancient Egypt. THE BOUND PRISONER MOTIF In a predynastic royal tomb of Gerzean date (ca. 3400-3200 B.C.) at Hierakonpolis (modern Kom el-Ahmar) was discovered a wall painting whose wide-ranging subject matter provides the first examples of numerous artistic themes which were to become canonical throughout the remainder of Egyptian history. Among these images to be standardized is the representation of a victorious ruler in the act of striking a series of 543. Louvre inv. E 27145 (du Bourguet 11. 295-329 (Preisendanz 1928, pp. 82-83).

The reason for their appearance is not difficult to discover, and is explicitly presented on the famous Narmer palette of Dynasty \"0\" from the temple precinct of Hierakonpolis.547 On the \"recto\" of this palette, as the standing king grasps his kneeling enemy by the hair and raises his mace to strike, he faces the falcon god Horus who stands atop an anthropomorphic symbol of the defeated territory with its head tethered by a rope held in the god's claw. In both posture and meaning, the acts of king and god are identical. The victory of the king, as the god's representative on earth, is ipso facto the victory of the god. Conversely, the political opponents of the king are transgressors against the god, demonic agents of chaos and death in an unending holy war. The king's sacrifice of the kneeling captive, like the palette which records it, is offered to the god not to commemorate the conquest, but to perpetuate it. Rendered tangible and permanent in stone, the image was designed not simply to reflect, but to create reality, guaranteeing by \"sympathetic magic\" the victory of the state and the gods. So pervasive was this image to become, that the exterior walls of virtually every Egyptian temple were provided with a rendition of the scene, which rapidly acquired more of a ritual than an historical validity.548 The fully developed motif is exemplified by the great pylon of Medinet Habu, on which Ramses III sacrifices prisoners before Amon, while the base line upon which both stand is composed of a series of anthropomorphic symbols of foreign lands, which are crushed underfoot by king and god alike in imitation of Horus on the Narmer palette.549 Forming a 545.

The transmission of this omnipresent motif from carved relief to figurine by no means represents an innovation of Roman times, however. From the earliest temple sector in Abydos, and dated to the First or Second Dynasty, derive two small stone figurines in a Lucerne collection which depict kneeling prisoners with their hands bound behind their backs.552 On one of these carvings (A 55), the neck is drilled to permit the captive to be suspended from a string (see fig. 3b). The figure is thus a three-dimensional rendering of the image found on the Hierakonpolis wall-painting and the predynastic palettes, being designed to enable the possessor to have his enemy physically by the throat.553 That the use of such statuettes was not isolated is shown by the discovery at Hierakonpolis of a similar figure in glazed pottery of equal date.554 As in the case of the palettes, these were presumably votive objects for the benefit of god and king. Designed more specifically for royal benefit are the numerous stone statues of prisoners discovered within the funerary complex of Pepi I.555 Clearly distinguished by their physiognomy as Nubians, Libyans, or Asiatics, the statues do not represent individual enemies, but serve instead as symbols of the neighbors, and thus traditional enemies, of Egypt. Greatly enlarged in scale from their predynastic predecessors, these Old Kingdom statues of waist height form an architectural element of the royal funerary temple.556 Their 550.

Representing a prostrate captive with his arms tied firmly behind his back at the elbows, the door socket supports the peg of the door leaf by a hole bored into the middle of the prisoner's back.558 The motif of the simple \"voodoo doll\" has here become architec- turally ritualized. With peg for pin, the figure is pierced not once but eternally; for with every motion of the door leaf, the peg is ground deeper into the back of the hapless prisoner. The complement to this representation is found in a description of a door socket in hell, written in the second Demotic romance of Setna Khamuas. Within an episode often compared to the parable of Dives and Lazarus, the heroes visit the underworld to witness the outcome of the funerals of a poor and a wealthy man. On entering the fifth portal of the netherworld, the heroes find that \"the pivot of the door of the fifth hall was fixed in the right eye of a man who was pleading and lamenting loudly.\"559 The recipient of this fate was the wealthy man, whose impious acts on earth qualify him as an enemy of the gods, and the counterpart of the terrestrial enemy of gods and king depicted in the First Dynasty door socket. They found his misdeeds more numerous than the good deeds which he had done on earth. It was ordered to imprison him in the netherworld. He is [the man whom you saw] with the pivot of the door of the netherworld fixed in his right eye, so that it opens and shuts on his eye, and his mouth is open in great lamentation.560 Separated by over three millennia and bracketing virtually the entirety of Egyptian history, these two representations are all but identical in outward form. The fundamental difference between them is the result of a gradual, internal religious modification, whereby the ethical misdeeds of an individual have come to outweigh the political misdeeds of a foreign enemy.561 The ethically recast imagery of the Setna tale was in turn influential and is still invoked in ninth century Coptic stories of the miscreant Symmachus: \"The tormentor 558.

Contemporary with the door socket, and deriving from the same temple precinct, is an ivory figure of a kneeling bound captive which served as the foot of a ceremonial chair (see fig. 4a).563 The chair's occupant would thus rest upon the back of the prisoner exactly as the god Horus had perched atop the conquered enemy on the Narmer palette. Two Second Dynasty statues of an enthroned figure of king Khasekhemwy from the same site reveal an elaboration of this theme. Running along the base of the statues, below the feet and chair of the king, a sprawling jumble of enemies is carved lying prostrate in slaughter, crushed beneath the feet of the monarch.564 The trampling underfoot of the enemy, depicted unambiguously here, becomes a permanent feature of Egyptian royal seated (and striding) statues-with a slight modification. Replacing the literal images of the vanquished enemies is a series of Nine Bows, the symbols of the traditional foes of Egypt, carved as if protruding from beneath the feet of the ruler.565 In conformity with the divine prototype of the image, statues of the king as Osiris may display the same feature.566 Figures of trussed captives (often tied to the symbol of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt) continue to appear, however, upon 562.

Thus should probably be explained the heads of captives on the base of an unguent jar from the tomb of Tutankhamun (see fig. 9), or the use of a prostrate figure as a handle on the lid of a stone box of Sheshonq 111.572 Among the more unusual representations of the motif is its appearance upon the linchpins of the chariot wheels of Ramscs II in the form of an Asiatic head bitten by a lion, 571. Simpson Corcoran 1988, pp. 106-16 (in response to the thesis version of the present work). Two unpublished, thin wooden \"sandals\" found in the debris of the western high gate at Medinet tHabu may be the earliest examples of the series (see here fig. 7 [reference courtesy John Larson]). Registered as Cairo Museum 59738 and given field notation MH 31: 28 (January 31, 1932), the sandals are painted on their upper sides with bound prisoners and the Nine Bows drawn in red ink. Remains of mummy linen still adhered to the upper side of the left sole. Lacking archaeological context, stylistic dating is necessary and would suggest a late New Kingdom date. In the excavation \"Teilungsliste.\" Holscher even suggested that the sandals might derive from the mummy of Ramses III! Further validating such images are the Book of the Dead spells copied on Late Period coffins that promise the subjugation of enemies beneath the sandals of the deceased; compare Rowe 1938, pp. 183-84 (= BD spell 151b, \u00a7S3). Contra Corcoran 1988, pp. 111- 12, the physical placement of these spells elsewhere on the coffin does not invalidate their importance for the inspiration or continued depiction of the motif. This developing iconography belies the general opinion that in the Roman period \"ornamentation of the mummy-cases gives evidence that the religious symbolism was 'misunderstood and its significance forgotten.'; H. I. Bell 1953, p. 64, quoting G. Elliot Smith and Warren R. Dawson. The hostile nuance of trampling, implicit in the placing of a name or image on a sandal, is still current and provocative. In 1989, two thousand protesters in Dhaka, Bangladesh, rioted during two days of protest against Canadian-based Beta Shoe Co. for marketing rubber slippers bearing a logo resembling the Arabic characters for Allah. Walking on the slippers was felt to constitute blasphemy against Islam (Chicago Tribune, Sunday, June 25, 1989, Section 1, p. 5). 572. For the jar of Tutankhamun, see Edwards 1976a, pp. 124-25.

The state chariot of Tutankhamun was also provided with images of prisoners on the curved terminals of its yoke (see fig. 10b).574 When tugged, the reins which passed through the yoke restrained not only the horses, but these figures as well. Similarly inventive is the use of enemy heads as the stops for the oars on the bark of Amon depicted on the reliefs of the valley festival at Karnak.575 With every stroke, the oarsmen would knock the enemies in the side of the head. A truly \"baroque\" development of the motif appears in the design of the first palace of Ramses III at Medinet Habu. Extending beneath and beyond the \"window of appearance\" of the king, a row of sculpted prisoners' heads forms the base line for the window itself, two flanking reliefs of the king leading captives to the window, and two larger reliefs of Ramses in the act of smiting foreign enemies (see fig. I la).576 The cumulative effect produced by these representations was, in the words of their excavator, \"self-explanatory.\"577 When Ramses stood in the window to receive audiences, he necessarily trod underfoot the stone heads carved beneath his feet-forming a living counterpart to the flanking triumphal reliefs. The identity of symbolic relief and physical 573. On reliefs from the forecourt of the Seti temple at Abydos and from Medinet Habu; for these and other examples, see Ellis 1966, pp. 41-48. Ellis, however, fails to recognize either the magical function of the design at Medinet Habu or the components of the design itself, which he describes as two \"teddy- bears\" (p. 43). Further examples appear now in The Epigraphic Survey 1986, pls. 2, 6, 9, 10, 23, 27, 28 (= p. 88), 29, 33, and 35 (= p. 107). The only extant examples of such pins are tentatively identified and discussed in Ritner 1986b, pp. 53-56, an equation denied 1987, pp. 57- 61, whose argumentation rests largely on extraneous foreign practices and questions of impracticality (for ceremonial chariots, compare the \"impractical\" gilt ceremonial shields of Tutankhamun). The image of the royal lion/sphinx devouring a prisoner is a commonplace of Egyptian art, compare the Ramesside statues published by Hamza 1930, pp. 46-51; see in Rihlmann 1964, pls. 1-7 and de pp. 16-36. It is from this political/cosmological viewpoint-and not from a theory of ancient racism-that one should also understand the faience vessel of a Nubian eaten by a crocodile published in Metzler and Hoffmann 1977, pp. 5-20. 574. Carter 1927, Crouwel 1985, pls. 23-24. The iconography of the royal chariot is necessarily associated with the bound or slain prisoner motif (Desroches-Noblecourt 1963, pp. 91 and 298) and compare the decoration of a buckle of Tutankhamun that depicts the king's chariot resting on a base of prisoners with a further captive tethered on a rope in Edwards 1976a, pp. 106-07. 575.

These three-dimensional enemy heads, themselves the descendants of the free-standing prisoner statues of the Old Kingdom, thus provide the architectural setting for the fusion of the two traditional techniques of ritual conquest-the static symbolism of relief known from the Narmer palette and the pylon facades, and the \"inherent kinetics\" of the Hierakonpolis door socket, footstools, et cetera. Architectural setting provides yet a third, unnoted dimension to the symbolism, for the placement of the window at head height establishes the king directly above his audience as well.578 As the king and his image are equated by standing above the base line, so the audience and the carved prisoners must correspond by lying beneath that line. From a distance, the visual impression-and concomitant symbolism-of the king atop his audience would be unmistakable. Developing simultaneously with the motif of the bound prisoner, the theme of the subservient Egyptian population, symbolized as rhy.t-birds (a^), had been used in conjunction with the former in the decoration of throne, dais and statue bases, windows of appearance, et cetera.579 At Medinet Habu, the king was quite literally Hr hr tp rby.t, \"Horus atop ('on the heads of') the masses.\"580 Although ornate, the Medinet Habu palace window is by no means unique. Sculpted heads of captives appear beneath the windows in the high gate at the same site, and bound prisoners, often in the form of glazed tiles, served a similar function in the royal windows of many kings.581 A small sculpture in Cairo of Horus standing atop two human heads provides the expected divine counterpart (see fig. 1 lb).582 The image of the triumphant Horus treading foes beneath his feet becomes 578.

For the identification of the rhy.t-peoples, see Cl&e 1958, pp. 43-44, who suggests that the image originally designated hostile Egyptians of the Delta margins in predynastic art. Koenig 1990, p. 115, following Favard-Meeks, assumes that this remained the only significance of the image-an overly strictured interpretation given the later elaboration and distribution of the theme. For \"subjugated\" examples, see nn. 553 and 567, above; and for palace decoration, see Riefstahl 1968, p. 48 and the sources in n. 581, below.

Daressy 1906, p. 160 and pl. 34. The figure is paralleled on the plate by images of Horus atop an antelope and a crocodile, two animals of Seth. There is no justification for the suggestion by Wildung that this statuette might belong to a tradition different from that of the Medinet Habu sculptures, contra idem 1973, p. 114, n. 35.127 oi.uchicago.eduTIlE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE standardized on the cippi of \"Horus on the Crocodiles,\" in which guise the motif remains influential until Byzantine times.583 The ultimate significance of this widespread motif of the \"subservient captive\" can be appreciated only by viewing the phenomenon as a whole. Such an examination reveals at once that the motif is not an element of popular or folk decoration generally current on common wares or utensils.584 Rather, it is confined to the ornamentation of state and 583. For the stelae of \"Horus on the Crocodiles,\" see above, Chapter 3, nn. 518-19, and below, p. 207, n. 956. For the hostile, Sethian nature of the crocodiles and other wild animals on these cippi, see below, n. 743. The traditional understanding of these animals as defeated and trampled enemies has been questioned by Quaegebeur 1984, pp. 131-43, repeated in summary in 1987, p. 187. Quaegebeur would view these dangerous animals as emissaries or assistants of the superior deity, ultimately positive in nature. The primary notion of such images, however, is to express the deity's mastery over the beasts-regardless of whether the animals' aggression is felt to be directed \"inward\" against the god or \"outward\" toward other noxious forces. The animal is shown to be subject/subservient to the god, whether as assistant or opponent. In either case, the iconologic notion remains \"superposition = control.\" The distinction between \"assistant\" and \"opponent\" need not be as great as posed, since the primary magical method of neutralizing serpents, et cetera, is to make their attack recoil upon themselves (\"evil to turn away evil\"), with force directed \"inward\" rebounded \"outward.\" When snakes are directed against snakes, opponents are made to function as allies, and \"assistant\" means only \"subjected opponent.\" The cobra is first and foremost a dangerous animal; its dangerous force may be controlled and thus directed by a god-only thus is it beneficent. The image of a god walking on (\"controlling\") a uraeus is therefore not so surprising, contra Quaegebeur 1984, p. 136. By the same rationale, Horus' scorpion wife T?-Bt.t, or Isis iddy.t, can subjugate and repel scorpions; their function is to restrain or destroy their own \"emblematic\" animal. This does not make the scorpion a \"good\" animal, merely a \"subjugated\" one. Contra Quaegebeur ibid., p. 143, the myths of Horus establish clearly that such \"trampled\" animals were a genuine threat to the deity. Horus' triumphant depiction on cippi as \"master of the animals\" (a posture attested from Pre-Dynastic times in the Asiatic-inspired Gebel el Arak knife handle) shows his ability to throttle his helpless enemies in his hands, while reducing his crocodile opponents to subservience \"beneath his feet,\" as in common Egyptian idioms explicitly quoted on cippi: \"Every male and female serpent, every snake, every lion, every crocodile is under the feet of this god\" (Whitehouse 1990-91, p. 5). There need be no great contrast here with images of Bes atop frogs as symbols of fertility (Quaegebeur 1984, pp. 140-42, fig. 17). In both cases the deity controls and directs the force which the animal incarnates. On this question, compare the disputed case of Tutu and the disease demons, in Ritner 1989b, pp. 111-12. Further confirmation of the traditional assessment of the trampled animals is afforded by an unpublished fragment of Ptolemaic (?) mummy cartonnage deriving from Dendera (EEF 1897-98), OIM no. 4784 (see here fig. 8). Half of the bottom of a footcase, the cartonnage depicts a scorpion crushed beneath the sole of the mummy's sandal, a representation directly comparable to late footcases provided with bound prisoners in identical position (see above, n. 571). The equation of hostile prisoner and scorpion is thus obvious-both are trod beneath the sandals of the victorious deceased. 584. Being neither used by the general populace nor displayed chiefly for their benefit-contra Hayes 1990, vol. 1, p. 113, who suggests that it provided \"a naive sense of satisfaction and security.\" Many of these images (the sandal soles, for example) would have been invisible to all but the king (and the gods); they could hardly qualify as propaganda. Publicly displayed examples of the prisoner motif (on128 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES t Figure 9.

Even for such public rituals, the intended chief beneficiaries of this \"propaganda\" were the gods. Bound prisoners are not a typical decorative theme on common pottery, mirrors, cosmetic items, et cetera, but their use is restricted to royal, votive, and religious contexts. Thus, while captives may appear on the \"mummy sandals\" of deceased (and ritually divinized) private individuals, they would not have appeared on the sandals used by such individuals in daily life. The funerary context also explains the presence of the motif on model chair(?) fragments from a private tomb at Saqqara; Quibell 1908, p. 79 and pl. 35, no. 3. oi.uchicago.edu130 THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE \\ r ( ,-- - b Figure 10.

In each case, the incorporation of the image as handle or support requires that it be grasped or crushed. Like the Hierakonpolis door socket, the inherent use of the object produces the symbolic result. Simply by making a state appearance, the king becomes a passive actor in the ritual destruction of the enemies of Egypt. What artistic and archaeological evidence suggests, textual evidence confirms. Although the earliest inscribed example of the \"subjugated prisoner\" motif, the Narmer palette, fails to label the central scene, one might reasonably expect that the Egyptian descriptive term would have comprised a verb of striking (sqr, hwi, etc.)-especially since the native expression for captive, sqr- 'nih, meant literally \"one who is stricken yet living.\"586 In fact, however, that does not often appear to have been the case. When descriptive labels do accompany these scenes, the action is generally termed ptpt, \"trampling,\" even where the visual suggestion of trampling is secondary, or even non- existent.587 On the Narmer palette as elsewhere, the fundamental significance of the image and rite lies not in the action of the king, but in that of the god Horus which the king evokes. Quite simply, the motif of the prisoner, like that of the r hy.t, makes concrete the \"superiority\" of the victor as \"Horus atop the masses.\" Physical elevation produces political, social, and cosmic domination.588 So inextricably mixed are the notions of 585. The distinction is confused by Hayes 1990, vol. 2, pp. 337-38, who improperly contrasts Ramesside examples of this hostile ritual motif with earlier, (non-ritual) peaceful scenes of foreigners as an index of Egypt's worsening foreign relations. Genuinely comparable imagery, like the Hierakonpolis door socket, statue bases of all periods, and the Tutankhamun objects, disproves Hayes' suggested contrast. Ramesside imagery may differ in quantity, but not in nature. 586. Wb 4: 307/12-19. 587. Wb 1: 563/9-16. For an example with the literal depiction of trampling, see the throne of Tuthmosis all foreign lands,\" in Pritchard 1954, p. 138, fig. 393. Extended uses of the term for non-literal trampling scenes appear in Sa'ad 1970, p. 191, ptpt [w]r.w (?), \"trampling chiefs\"; and ptpt wr.w nw hs.t nb, \"trampling the chiefs of all the foreign lands.\" Examples of \"striking\" do occur, however; cf. the tag hwl hk?-h1s.wt, \"striking rulers lands\" (Amenhotep II), in Helck 1955b, p. 1333, I. 13. Later tags also scene as sm? sb(, \"slaughtering enemies\" 70). 588. Thus the inscription on a phylactery against the dangers of travel begins: \"All waters, foreign lands, mountains, and all waters in them are beneath the feet of Horus the son of Isis\" (Daressy 1903, p. 37). By the same method the deceased may triumph over the force of life itself; compare the depiction on the inner footboard of a Middle Kingdom coffin of two 'nh-signs with the inscription: 'ntf.wy r t? Ijr rd.wy-k(y), \"the two symbols of life are on the ground beneath your feet,\" and the actual use of such ankhs beneath the corpse in the funerary purification ceremony, in Grdseloff 1941, pp. 30 and 32-33.131 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE \"above,\" \"superiority,\" \"chief,\" etc. in the Egyptian language, that even the two hiero- glyphs which compose the phrase \"atop,\" are given mythological significance, being interpreted as \"Horus atop Seth.\"589 Similar in inspiration was the late reinterpretation of the signs composing the \"Golden Horus\" name of the king as \"Horus atop the Ombite\" (a title of Seth).590 In the Oryx Nome, the equation of the tutelary animal with Seth produced both a modified writing of the name of the district with a Horus falcon atop the back of the oryx , and a new name for the Horus priest in the chief city of Hebenu: \"He who is on his back.\"591 As in the case of \"encircling,\" a simple physical action has acquired a non-literal, ritual nuance. Prominent throughout Egyptian religious literature, this ritual aspect is already in evidence in the Pyramid Texts, where it serves as both a counterpart and an explanation for traditional designs on thrones, footstools, sandals, et cetera. Geb has put his sandal on the head of your foe, who flinches from you.592 Horus has laid hold of Seth, and has set him under you in your behalf so that he may lift you up and quake beneath you.593 Horus has stretched out for you your foe under you.594 Horus has caused Thoth to bring your foe to you, he has set you on his (scil. the foe's) back that he may not thwart you; take your place upon him, go up and sit on him, do not let him escape from you.595 589.

Within an exemplar of spell 168, a description of the gods of the caverns in the netherworld, the enemies of the deceased are consigned beneath the feet of Osiris, conforming to the placement of the spell itself: ... (as for) one who harms him, he is put under thy feet forever. To be used on the [corner] under the feet of Osiris the lord of eternity.598 The accompanying texts on the footstools of Tutankhamun are no less explicit, exclaiming \"All lands and every secret Phoenician are under the feet of this good god,\" or simply \"Every foreign land is under your sandals.\"599 A millennium later, the phraseology is unchanged in a Demotic petition to a Ptolemaic ruler (rtw w ti n,'y fs b hr rt f, \"Let his enemies be put under his feet\").60o while contemporary temple rituals for the destruction of Apophis, Seth, and foreign enemies dictate the trampling underfoot (dg s, dgdg, or sin m rt) of images of these demonic forces.601 The \"magical\" component of this activity is unmistakable, and when the motif recurs in the Demotic magical papyrus of London and Leiden, adapted for the practitioner rather than the Pharaoh, the gods, or the private tomb owner, there can be no question of any real substantive difference: 596.

Thus, a curse requires that the enemy's name be inscribed on a lead plate put under the sole of the left foot of the magician.603 An invocation to Seth for the same purpose concludes: \"Enslave NN to NN and cause him to come under my feet.\"604 The significance of the act is expressed succinctly in a further curse: \"As these holy names are trampled down, so too is NN, my oppressor.\"605 The influence of the \"prisoner motif' was felt not only by Greeks, but by the Meroitic inheritors of Pharaonic culture. Ironically, Hellenistic Meroe freely adopted the image of the Nine Bows and bound prisoners placed under the royal throne which had formerly symbolized its own subservience.606 Free-standing statues and applied throne decorations of prisoners also appear, recalling the archaic and Old Kingdom prototypes from which the motif had originally developed (see fig. 12a, b).607 Meroitic adaptations of the motif reveal innovations as well. Sacrificial animals were adorned with bells engraved with images of bound prisoners, struck repeatedly by the clapper as the animal was led to slaughter.608 Pierced by a nail, small plaques of enemies were fixed beneath temple flag staffs, crushed beneath the post like the Hierakonpolis door socket some thirty centuries earlier.609 602.

At the end of this iconographic tradition is the Louvre figurine of the female lover depicted as a bound prisoner. Yet while the \"prisoner motif' contributed the imagery for the figure, it is to a different tradition that one must look for its manipulation, and for the transition of the image from royal to private magic. THE EXECRATION TEXTS If the magical aspect of the \"prisoner motif\" and its related imagery is largely passive in nature, dependent upon either the mere existence or the \"inherent kinetics\" of the design itself, there remains yet a second use of prisoner figurines in which active, ritual manipulation is unmistakable: as supports for the so-called \"execration texts.\" First noted oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES on some 289 pottery fragments by Schafer and Sethe in 1925,610 these cursing formulae inscribed on pots and figurines now number in excess of 1,000 exemplars, and are attested from the Old Kingdom through the Late Period.611 Although the texts vary widely in complexity, ranging from individual figures to elaborate assemblages, their unity of purpose and general similarity of technique have defined them as a corpus. Unlike the \"prisoner motif\" which presents only generalized images of foreigners, the execration texts are quite specific in their intended victims.612 For by the addition of names, the pot or figurine becomes a substitute image of those victims, an Egyptian counterpart to the \"voodoo doll\" (see fig. 13a). The coupling of name and prisoner image thus effected directly parallels standard practice in the hieroglyphic script as well, where enemy names may receive a \"bound prisoner\" determinative , (Gardiner Sign-list A 13).613 While the use of a figurine as a substitute image is obvious to the modern researcher, the symbolism 610.

Also associated with the deposit containing the first of these texts was an uninscribed clay statuette, broken and incomplete. The remaining deposits consisted only of individually labeled figurines, and the use of such images without the \"rebellion formula\" continues into the Middle Kingdom, while from the New Kingdom on this pattern alone is typically attested. Despite the variation in content (extending also to the number of smaller figurines), all four of these deposits are nonetheless intimately associated by date (three within the space of two months), handwriting (seemingly only two scribes for four deposits), and by the recurrence of identical names throughout.618 All were interred in the Giza cemetery, most enclosed in jugs docketed with the regnal year and a personal name.619 chooses, So are men in the hand of their maker,\" in Lichtheim 1983, p. 142. In magic, the concept clearly underlies a Ramesside cursing spell which identifies an enemy as a lump of clay, malleable and helpless in the hand of the magician (Shorter 1936). The Egyptian association of clay with man- kind is also reflected in an episode in Pap. Vandier, in which the magician molds clay (qd 'm'.t) to form a subservient man of pp. 31-32 These directly disprove the contention of Derchain 1981, p. 46a (end of first paragraph: \"il ne semble pas que le mythe du modelage ait men6 A une association particuliere de l'homme et de la glybe.\" 615.

Completing the later pattern is an enumeration of generally threatening forces, including evil speech, slander, plots, strife, nightmares,622 et cetera. Whereas previous sections defend against political or military threat, these concluding designations serve to ward against magical assault, perhaps in anticipation of similar execration magic by Egypt's foes.623 In any individual find, the entire sequence of foreigners, Egyptians, and forces may appear in multiple copies by different scribes, and, like the Old Kingdom (and New Kingdom) examples, the resulting assemblage is most often interred within a traditional necropolis. Although there is great variation in the manner in which the texts may be 620. The texts of the Middle Kingdom assemblages show progressive development from Old Kingdom prototypes, providing internal evidence for their chronological sequence: the Cairo alabaster figurines (Sesostris I), the Mirgissa deposit (Amenemhat II-Sesostris II), the Berlin bowls (mid Twelfth Dynasty), and the Saqqara figures (end of Twelfth Dynasty). For the respective dates, see the table in Posener 1987, p. 14, with the minor corrections in Koenig 1990, p. 102, n. 8. 621. From the Berlin bowls; for a translation of the general pattern of these texts, see Sethe 1926, pp. 72-73 and Wilson 1969c. The alabaster figures in Cairo (JdE 63955-59) display a slightly different ordering of the texts, being intermediate in development between the Giza and Berlin finds (from Helwan?, dating to Sesostris I; see Posener 1987, pp. 17-56). Only these Cairo exemplars include a section devoted to the geographic areas of Egypt; ibid., pp. 38-40. For the Mirgissa texts, see Koenig 1990. 622. Literally \"evil dreams in evil sleep\"; for this improved reading, see Posener 1966, pp. 283. 623. See the remarks of Vila 1973, p. 627. The complete text of this section has been provided for the Berlin and Mirgissa finds (see Sethe 1926, pp. 69-72 and Koenig 1990, pp. I 16-17). For the Egyptian fear of foreign magic, compare the remarks of Amenhotep II to his viceroy in Nubia: \"Do not be merciful to the Nubians at all. Guard yourself against their people and their magicians,\" in Helck 1955a, p. 25. The perception of a Nubian magical threat is still in evidence in the Roman period, see the second Setna tale in Lichtheim 1980, pp. 138-51. Actual adoption of Egyptian execration techniques by the Hebrews (Amos 1:2-2:16) has been suggested in Bentzen 1950; followed by West 1971, p. 244; but denied by Weiss 1969. For this question, see the obvious execration rite of the broken pottery in Jeremiah 19:1-11 (noted also in Koenig 1990, p. 101): \"Thus said the Lord, 'Go, buy a potter's earthen flask, and take some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests, and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom at the entry of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you' ... Then you shall break the flask in the sight of the men who shall go with you, and shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord of hosts: So will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, so that it can never be mended.'\"140 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES copied, with sections contained on individual pieces or spread across several pots or figures, so standardized are the texts themselves that restorations of lacunae are fairly easy, both within a single find and-allowing for foreign regnal changes-from one find to another.624 To produce such an assemblage would require a canonical textual schema, distributed most likely from a single source, a staff of trained scribes, and detailed, current records of the names and parentage of rulers from even small localities well beyond Egypt's borders.625 Clearly, only the state could meet these requirements.626 Thus, despite their typically rather undistinguished find spot in or beside private graves, the elaborate execration formulae would seem not private but state productions, obviously designed to suppress revolt at home and abroad. This straightforward scenario may be a bit too simplistic, however, and Posener in particular has suggested a greater degree of participation by private individuals or localities in the drafting of the list of condemned Egyptians, who are usually qualified by the term mwt (dead man) or mwt.t (dead woman).627 These terms, he insists, must be taken literally, and the texts should constitute the damnatio memoriae of deceased-and possibly executed-local criminals. It should be noted, however, that the term sqr \"stricken one/prisoner\" is applied prospectively to foreign soldiers who have not been captured,628 and the form of the figurines themselves constitutes a \"wish fulfillment\" projected upon the 624. See the discussions pp. Koenig 1987a, p. 306. 625. The desire to ensure that the records were kept current is reflected by the updating of the names of rulers and states (Sethe 1926, pp. 42, p. 104, textual note d [successive heirs of Kit]). 626. Compare the remarks of Posener 1966, p. 284, n. 1; noted in Koenig 1987a, p. 306 and idem 1990, p. 102. The central figures of the Mirgissa deposit were made of limestone, not local to the area and thus presumably sent by the royal chancellery. Posener suggests that these figures were dispatched already inscribed to serve as a model for the other textual copies at the site. 627. Versus Sethe 1926, pp. 62-69 (followed by Wilson 1969c, p. 329), who was unaware of the feminine examples and interpreted mwt as the optative form of the NN die.\" Posener's re-interpretation of the term as a noun was first advanced hesitantly in 1939b, p. 46 and more forcefully in 1958, pp. 265-70. For the question of local input in these rites, see ibid., p. 269 and Posener 1976a, pp. 439-40. Egyptians not described as \"dead\" occur in the Giza texts discussed in Abu Bakr and Osing 1973, pp. 129-30; the alabaster figures in Posener 1987, pp. 55-56 and compare the Cairo \"tablets\" discussed in Posener 1976a, p. 439. See also below, p. 184 and n. 856. 628. For the reading sqr (phonetic spelling), see Posener 1966, p. 283 and 1940, pp. 26-28 versus van de Walle 1940, pp. 108-09, who accepts a variant reading hnk, \"trusted ones,\" for the Berlin texts (following Sethe 1926, pp. 15-16). The anticipatory use of the term sqr is acknowledged by Posener himself (1977, pp. 504-05). Such usage is perfectly in accord with standard Egyptian practice; compare the common application of the word hsy, \"wretched/defeated,\" to the names of Cush, Khatti, etc. (Wb 3:399/11).141 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE associated individuals.629 The term \"deceased\" could be similarly anticipatory,630 and the related Bremner-Rhind ritual specifically includes enemies of both king and practitioner \"whether dead or alive.\"631 Private influence is probable also in those finds consisting only of Egyptian names on individual figures. Lacking the \"rebellion formula\" (and thus any clear indication of state interest), these figures may nonetheless retain the term mwt, and are subjected to the same treatment as figures in ostensible state productions. Despite the implication of a private impetus for these deposits, they have been analyzed as forming a unity with the Egyptian section, whose social implications are discussed below. BINDING Aside from the one certain and one possible use of wishful terminology, the execration lists contain nothing which, in itself, could be called magical, serving merely to identify the individual, nation, or force with the inscribed pot or figure.632 The desired magical effect of these assemblages must thus derive not frome te text, but from the ritual to which they were subjected.633 Just what might constitute this ritual has been the subject of some dispute. 629. See the remarks of Posener 1974, The phrase Koenig 1987a, p. 302. 630. The \"dead man\" determinative ,(Gardiner Sign-list A 14) after foreign names on the Berlin bowls (Sethe 1926, p. 19) has the same implications. 631. See col. 26/2: \"Now make for yourself every enemy of Re, every enemy of Pharaoh, dead or alive, together with every accused one in his heart\" (Faulkner 1933, pp. 56 and 1937b, p. 171); and col. 28/17-18: \"Then inscribe for yourself these names of all male and female enemies whom your heart fears as the enemies of Pharaoh, whether dead or alive\" (Faulkner 1933, p. 69 and 1937b, p. 175). 632. Notably, no verbs of cursing appear anywhere in the standard text, producing an extended list whose significance is clear only from its context on prisoner figurines or broken pottery. Compare the remarks of Sethe 1926, pp. 19-20 (discounting his example of mwt, \"Let NN die\"). Posener 1987, p. 1, n. 2, thus insists that the common designation \"execration text\" is inappropriate, accepting only the term \"proscription.\" However, some cursing elements do occur, such as the selection of red ink and enemy determinatives, and the prospective use of sqr (and possibly rmwt) just mentioned. The Cairo alabaster figures follow the names of Nubian princes with insults to produce the pattern: \"NN, against whom one says, 'Is there anyone attached to him?' (var. 'Are you Mud tablets from Lisht also qualify the intended enemies as \"separated from\" (wl r) former names and titles (Hayes 1955, 57-58 and Vernus 1974, pp. 121-23). Such derogatory epithets are not simple expressions of pique, but known cursing techniques-as acknowledged by Posener \"le ridicule tue.\" 633. Contra Posener 1975b, p. 407, who emphasizes the spell with reference to the late execration ritual against Seth (Schott 1929); similarly in Posener 1974, p. 401, where the operative force is said to be psychological rather than magical: \"L'effet recherch6 est One might well wonder how the \"contrainte psychologique\" of an act carried out in an Egyptian graveyard would affect a chieftain in a hilltop village in Palestine, a tent in Libya, or a hut in Nubia.142 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES With regard to the figures, at least, one obvious constituent was bondage, for in addition to the summary indication of tied limbs on representations in alabaster and wood,634 clay exemplars from Giza and Saqqara reveal holes for binding or suspension with cords.635 Such images parallel the archaic prisoner figurine from Abydos discussed above (p. 116), and provide but the first of many correspondences between the execration rite and tortures enacted on earth, in the netherworld, and in temple cult and private enchantment.636 As the tangible counterpart to the \"surrounding\" (Sni) and \"encircling\" (phr) so prominent in the Egyptian vocabulary of magic, physical binding is correspondingly \"bivalent,\"637 signifying 634. For the design of alabaster figures, see the discussion in Heimer 1981 and Posener 1987, pp. 7-10; for wooden images, see Reisner 1913, p. 62 and Posener 1984. A selection of bound execration figures from the archaic(?) through the Roman periods appears in Petrie 1972, p. 19 (no. 60, a-d) and pl. 5. 635. For Old Kingdom examples, see Junker 1947, pp. 32-34; Abu Bakr and Osing 1973, p. 98; and Osing 1976a, p. 156 and pl. 51. Carbonized traces of cord still adhered to some Saqqara examples (Posener 1940, pp. Nock, and Thompson 1933, p. 12; and Gardiner 1951. 637. A concise discussion of the significance of binding derived largely from German folklore appears in Morenz 1958, with which cf. the entirely \"cross-cultural\" interpretation of Petrie 1972, p. 29. While such interpretations of shared symbols are broadly correct, they cannot elucidate the specific range of meaning within individual societies. Thus, in contrast to the German \"Bindezauber,\" the French \"nouer l'aiguillette a quelqu'un,\" the and the Latin \"ligatio\" (see Kropp 1930-31, vol. 3, p. 199) or even \"religio,\" Egyptian terminology generalized the notion of \"surrounding\" in preference to that of \"binding.\" The distinction is of some significance as a reminder that even such common cross- cultural magical phenomena as \"magical knots\" are evaluated and understood differently by differing cultures (as is magic itself) and should be analyzed in cultural context. Contrast the \"culturally- specific\" analysis of \"sealing\" in as an expression for \"magic\" is rarely used in Egyptian texts. The term ts.t in the late Pap. Salt 825 has been translated \"conjuration\" by Derchain, but only the literal nuance of \"knot\" (as \"phylactery\") may be intended: \"(a rite) that overthrows magic (hk?.w), ties/firms knots, subjugates (cols. 7/9, 8/1, and 143 (col. 15/6). A single, highly uncertain Demotic example of \"binding\" (mrL.t) as a technical term for \"magic\" has been suggested in Spiegelberg 1917a, pp. 34-35 (col. 12/13) and p. 144 (no. 330). Coptic use of binding terminology is more common but may derive from Greek precedent, see MOYP, \"binding magic\" as a type of spell in Crum 1939, p. 181b, and cf. P'MOYP, MNTPC'MOYP, and EINMOYp, in ibid., p. 182a. Preserved binding spells in Coptic include Ms. Oriental Institute 13767 (Stefanski 1939), Pap. Heidelberg 1682 (Bilabel 1934, Kropp 1930-31, vol. 2, p. 228).143 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE either protection (as magical knots638) or hostile restraint.639 Obviously, it is the latter nuance of constriction which is depicted in the prisoner motif and enacted on the execration figurines, and this is expressed unambiguously in the ritual binding recommended for the prototype of the Louvre female figurine. While tying each knot, the magician is to call out: \"Abrasax, hold her fast!\"640 BREAKING THE RED POTS No such figurines were associated with the first identified texts, the Berlin bowls, which consisted exclusively of shattered and generally inscribed red clay vessels.641 Sethe concluded that the vessels had been ceremonially broken, and he linked the execration rite with that of \"Breaking the Red Vases\" (sd dgr.w) attested in Pyramid Texts spell 244.642 Hail, [Osiris NN,] this is the Eye of Horus. Take it so that you may be strong and that he may be terrified of you-Break the red vases.643 The determinative of the word \"break,\" , in the Merenre version of this spell implies the use of a mortar and pestle, and Schott has suggested that it is this pestle which the verse 638. The protective aspect of binding (ts) and knots (ts.t) derives from the nuance of \"joining/coming together\" both in acts of creation and as protection from threatened dissolution. Thus the same word ts is used when semen \"comes (Pap. Bremner-Rhind, col. 28/22), a deity \"comes together\" in spell 938 and Wh 5: 398/1), Isis \"joins\" the severed limbs of Osiris, and the deceased \"knits together\" his own limbs (Wh 5: 397/15-20). Embodied in the royal cartouche (see Gardiner 1973, p. 74), the positive significance of knots is metaphorically applied to the red crown in CT spell 684: \"it ties up life for me\" (see Faulkner 1977, p. 250 = de Buck 1956, p. 314). For a discussion of the root meaning of \"to congeal/make firm/solidify,\" see Roquet 1984, pp. 355-85. 639. In medicine, such hostile knots appear less as \"bonds\" than as \"obstacles\" to poisons and disease; \"to remove difficulties\"; and, for examples, see Borghouts 1978, p. 24. The same conception probably underlies the untying of knots to facilitate pregnancy in Pap. Westcar, col. 10/2 (Staehelin 1970 and compare Bonner 1950, p. 93; versus Borghouts 1970, p. 156 and Goedicke 1985, p. 21, n. 9). 640. Preisendanz 1928, pp. 82-83 (PGM IV, 1. 332); Betz 1986, p. 44.

On the Fifth Dynasty coffin of NN-hft-k? from Deshasheh it forms part of the conclusion of the standard schedule of mortuary offerings, bracketed by the fundamental rites of \"reversion of divine offerings\" (sd.t sntr).648 A similar schedule of offerings painted in a Sixth Dynasty burial chamber at Meir associates the rite with that of \"removing the footprints\" (in.t-rd), the cultic sweeping of the ground at the completion of temple or funerary offerings,649 and this pairing is repeated in inscriptions and relief decoration from the contemporary tomb of Mereruka at Saqqara.650 The red vessels reappear in the frieze of purification utensils on Middle Kingdom coffins,651 and spell 926 of the Coffin Texts echoes the Fifth Dynasty offering list in a direct address to the deceased: Wash yourself, sit down at the meal, put your hands on it; divert the god's offerings, break the red pots, give cold water, purify the offering-tables ... fire and incense are for NN ...652 The association of the \"breaking of the red vases\" with the funerary offering meal was already implied in the Pyramid Texts of Unas, where the spell containing the rite follows others designed to provide the king with offerings (spell 199), libations (spell 32), and 644.

At the Luxor temple, Amenhotep III performs the ceremony before Amon-Re by striking two of these pots together.656 The use of such red vessels (dir.w) continues into the Ptolemaic period, where as in the archaic liturgy-they are carried about the site to be purified.657 While the sources explicitly linking the \"Breaking of the Red Vases\" with offering meals are strangely silent about the significance of the act, the earliest reference to the rite in the Pyramid Texts is quite specific; breaking the red vases inflicts terror upon one's enemies.658 The aggressive nature of the ritual is reinforced by the simultaneous butchering of a bull in the slaughterhouse of the pyramid temple.659 The pairing was fundamental, and, relocated before the private tomb, the sacrifice accompanies New Kingdom performances as well.60 The breaking of the vessels corresponds to the sectioning of the bull, and in a subsequent libation, the strewn water was perhaps equated 653. See Blackman 1924, pp. 50-51. Borchardt 1929; Norman de Garis Davies 1925, p. 48: and idem 1948, pl. 25 (bottom right) and p. 36 (misidentified as sprinkling offerings on the road). Similar scenes appear in the tomb of Horemhab at Saqqara (G. T. Martin 1989, p. 101, n. 4 and pls. 118-23 and van Dijk 1986, cols. 1391-96). An intact deposit of broken vessels from such a funerary meal appears in G. T. Martin 1985, pp. 3 and 47- 48. The relationship of this rite to that of the Pyramid Texts (and execration texts) was denied by Sethe as quoted in Borchardt 1929, p. 16. n. 8. because the earlier ritual seems to have been accomplished by pestle, whereas the New Kingdom examples show vessels simply thrown to the ground. However, the discovery by Moret of an example of sd d. r.w performed by smashing two vessels together shows that it is not the method of breaking, but the breaking itself which is the basis of the rite. Compare the remarks of Liiddeckens 1943, p. 14 and Posener 1974, p. 398. 656. See Moret 1938. 657. See Chassinat 1928, p. 338 (and above, p. 58, n. 268) and Mallet 1909, p. 75. 658. The importance of \"emic\" analysis for ritual acts is underscored by a deceptive parallel to New Kingdom burial customs in modem Haiti, where the funeral of a voodoo initiate is accompanied by the breaking of a clay jar (canari) to release the soul of the deceased. Far from frightening enemies, the rite marks the most propitious moment for enemies to snare the defenseless spirit (W. Davis 1985, pp. 182 and 269). 659.

RED The hostile overtones of the ritual are at once evident in the specified color of the pottery itself, for the negative \"Sethian\" associations of the color red are well known.662 The customary color of demonic figures (Seth, Apophis, etc.) in wax or clay, red is also the preferred color for ink used to write the names of such demons and enemies.663 The two uses are combined in the execration texts, where both substitute figure (pot or clay figurine) and identifying inscription are often red.664 A further link between this color and the execration texts may reside in an Old Kingdom title \" which Edel has read sh 661. See van Dijk ibid., col. 1393 and Altenmuller 1972, pp. 99-100 and compare pp. 92-93. In the New Kingdom, the Old Kingdom libation is paralleled by the emptying of the vessels prior to breaking. 662.

For red-haired men as \"Sethian,\" see Gardiner 1935, vol. 1, pp. 10 and 20-21. As an adjective, \"red\" is often a synonym to \"evil\"; compare Wb 5: 488/4. The evil connotations of the color can also be stressed by the determinatives of the word \"red\" (dir) itself; see the use of the \"evil- (Gardiner Sign-list G 37) and \"dying-man,\" (Gardiner Sign-list A 14) determinatives in Wh 5: 488. Similarly, late writings of the word with the Oxyrhynchus fish ' (Gardiner Sign-list K 4; Wb 5: 488, usual value ht), although derived from the \"red fish\" (Wb 5: 492/10-11) may evoke a visual pun on the word for corpse (h, .t); see the following n. 663. For a general discussion of the color, see Griffiths 1972 and Lefebvre 1949. The link between the vases and the god Seth was first suggested with hesitation by Sethe 1928b, p. 102 and followed by Luddeckens 1943, p. 13, n. I. 663. Red wax figures of Apophis are ritually destroyed in the \"Apophis Book\" \"red\" with \"corpse\" and translates \"waxen body\"; for this confusion, cf. the preceding note. Ramesside examples appear in the magical Pap. Chester Beatty 7, col. 5/5 (red snake pierced by black knives), and among the vignettes on the verso (serpent pierced with knives, whole image brushed over with red; see Gardiner 1935, vol. 2, pls. 34, 38, and 38a). Similar figures of Seth appear in the \"Anti-Seth Book,\" see Schott 1929, pp. 4-5 (1. 6) and 36-37 (1. 2). An image of Seth as a red wax hippopotamus (inscribed with enemy names) was used in conjunction with a red goat and ox in ceremonies at Edfu (Alliot 1954, pp. 521 and 524 [= Chassinat 1930, pp. 132-34]). The hippo figure was adopted in a dream sending spell in the PGM (see Preisendanz 1931, p. 103 [= PGM XIII, 1. 309]). For the use of red ink in rubrics and the avoidance of the color for gods' names, see Posener 1949 and Faulkner 1937b, pp. 166-67 and n. 1. The avoidance of the color in beneficial magic is maintained in Demotic spells and derivatively in the PGM; compare the requirement that divinatory lamps be \"without a slip of red lead\" (i'w( prl = &jiiA{to;o), in Griffith and Thompson 1904, pp. 44-45, n. to 5/4. The violent connotations of the color are not, however, restricted to ancient Egypt, cf. Sheridan's The Rivals, Act 3, scene 4: \"I must be in a rage ... Come here's pen and paper.

From the earliest periods of Egyptian history the breaking of grave goods had constituted \"killing\" the objects to assimilate them to their deceased owner. 669 More pertinent to the malevolent intent of the execration ritual is the widespread practice of defacing extant images of enemies to produce a damnatio mnemoriae which rendered the depiction \"magically\" useless, and whose effect could be felt in the underworld as a \"second death.\"67 Royal, ecclesiastical, and personal in motivation, the practice is best exemplified by the well-known destruction of images of Hatshepsut by Tuthmosis 11I, of the god Amon by Akhenaton, of Akhenaton by Horemhab, of the Cushites by 24-25 (1353). For red hair as a Sethian diagnostic trait, see n. 662, above. \"Redheads\" might refer not to \"Sethian\" persons, but to demons; compare Wh 5:439/13 and Faulkner 1958, pp. 25, 38, and 56* (col. 35/13): \"The souls of the red- haired ones.\" 666. Compare the use of \"red-faced\" (dir br) and \"red-hearted\" (d.r ih) as expressions for \"angry\"; Wb 5: 490/4-6; and the modern American counterpart \"seeing red,\" and French \"voir rouge.\" 667. Diodorus would either misrepresent execration ceremonies as actual human sacrifice or record actual sacrifice which was replaced by the execration rite. See also the remarks of Plutarch in Griffiths 1970, p. 165. A thorough analysis of this tradition and the possibility of human sacrifice in Egypt is found in Yoyotte 1980-81. But compare also nn. 755 and 795, below. 668.

Similar practice in the worship of Hathor probably derives from the funerary associations of that goddess (Kertesz 1976, pp. 134-36). 670. For the practice, see Davies and Gardiner 1915, pp. 19-21 and 39 and Drioton 1952.148 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES dynasty, of the god Seth by the late priesthood, and by the mutilation of figures in private tombs of all periods.671 Though intensified, Coptic and Islamic destruction of \"pagan\" images merely follows the traditional technique. As an obvious expression of destruction, breaking appears in the Pyramid Texts not only in the ritual of the red vases, but also in a spell to supplant a divine scribe: Scribe, scribe, smash your palette, break your pens, tear up your rolls! Oh Re, expel him from his place and set me in his place.672 Although this text might seem straightforward without symbolic nuance, its Coffin Texts descendant suggests that the opposite is true. Spell 425, a \"spell for driving away a vulture,\" addresses: ... you two vultures who are on the booths of the Potter! I have come to you that I may break your water-pots and smash your inkwells, for a path is prepared for me to the place where the great god is.673 From parallel spells 667 and 688, it appears that these vultures are hostile underworld emissaries who must be repulsed from the offerings of the deceased: ... your dues are faeces, and NN will not give you this which he brings into the Island of Fire (the island of the sun god).674 The mention of the booths of the Potter and the smashing of the water-pots as a preliminary act in the procession to the underworld cannot but recall the ritual \"breaking of the red pots\"-especially the New Kingdom attestations performed at booths beside funerary processions-and the chosen enemy, the vulture, is an obvious threat to the food and corpse of the deceased. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that these Coffin and Pyramid Texts spells actually pertain to the rite, and that the unidentified enemy (or at least an enemy) repelled from offering meals by breaking the serving vessels was the vulture. Whether or not this identification is correct, the ritual nature of \"breaking\" in the Coffin Texts is clear. To render an enemy harmless, eyes, fingers, staffs, teeth, oars, knives, shields, and even potter's wheels are broken.675 The most blatant reference to the ritual 671. For such intentional breakage of statuary and relief, see Gardiner 1961, pp. 182-83, 187, 228, and 360; Hari 1984; and for the persecution of Seth, see te Velde 1977, pp. 144ff. 672.

Thus by the Middle Kingdom, the serpent Apophis is characterized as \"He of the broken kas\" (Idu-k: .w).680 In the second stela of the king belittles his Nubian opponents as \"wretches, broken of hands and hearts.\"681 The imagery 676.

In BD spell 125c, \u00a7S6, the deceased shatters a block of green faience which he has previously buried and mourned and then throws the fragments into a lake (Allen 1974, p. 100). If the block represents Osiris, the ritual breaking would re-enact the cutting up of the corpse of that god by Seth and its subsequent dispersal. The elements of this initiatory rite, though enigmatic, seem to relate to the Osiris cycle: 1) rejoicing in the land of Phoenicia (cf. the finding of Osiris in Byblos, in Griffiths 1970, p. 141); 2) the severed haunch representing the leg of Seth which struck Osiris; 3) the water in which Osiris was drowned (cf. te Velde 1977, pp. 84-91); and 4) the torch for repelling Seth (Griffiths 1958, pp. 5-7).

Line 13 (with a parallel at Uronarti; see Fischer 1973). The association of this expression with the execration rite would be even stronger if the word read by Fischer as \"hands\" is to be reinterpreted as150 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES at once recalls the actual breaking in the execration rite and may well derive from it.682 The Chester Beatty \"Dream Book\" of the New Kingdom incorporates this execration technique within its collection of hostile symbolism: \"(If a man see himself in a dream) breaking a vessel with his feet-BAD; it means fighting.\"683 Idiom and rite are combined in the \"Anti-Seth Book\" of the Late Period which dictates the destruction of wax figures of Seth and his confederates while proclaiming that \"the Breaker of Millions has broken their hearts.\"684 The adoption of execration terminology is nowhere more striking than in the stereotyped and widely-disseminated stelae of \"Horus on the Crocodiles.\" Used popularly as amulets against animal bite, the stelae petition the gods to seal the mouths of lions, crocodiles, snakes, and scorpions: Make them for me as the pebbles of the desert, as the potsherds along the street.685 Such a reduction of enemies to harmless potsherds is, of course, exactly what the ritual of the red vases had accomplished--quite literally-since its first appearance in the Pyramid Texts. A similar conception may underlie the use of ostraca in private curses from the New the \"broken pot\" determinative, as in W. V. Davies 1976. Further figurative uses of the verb \"to break\" (sd) are found in Wb 4: 374/17-24 and Wb 3: 419/8-10 (sw). 682. It is interesting to note that the appearance of this expression at the Nubian forts of Semna and Uronarti is in accord with the Middle Kingdom enactment of execration rites at such sites; compare the remains from Uronarti and Mirgissa discussed in Vila 1973 and 1963; with 1967, Papyrus Chester Beatty 3, col. 10/9, in Gardiner 1935, vol. 1, p. 19 and vol. 2, pl. 8.

Standard Text A, attested from the New Kingdom through the Greco-Roman eras.

Rylands 104). The common and innocuous nature of pottery led to its selection as an Egyptian expression for the general notion \"things\" (Iin.w \"pots\"> \"things\"; compare English and German \"stuff/Stoff\"); see Wb 3:107/11 and Hayes 1955, pl. XIV (text B vo., 11. 3 and 5). Although potsherds were a major constituent of ancient garbage and a ready symbol of death, the special significance of broken pottery in the Egyptian execration rite leaves little doubt about the intended magical allusion in this text, itself an execration of hostile animals. For the imagery in Mesopotamia, compare Kramer 1969a, p. 459: \"Its people, not potsherds, filled its sides\"; and 1969b, p. 618: \"Ur is shattered by the weapon like a (potter's) vessel.\" Magical allusions appear as well, cf. Lambert 1957-58, pp. 292 (no. 39): \"[They have made images of me and li]ke a broken pot they placed them in a well\"; 294 (no. 75) and 299 (no. 42) \"Smash them (scil. images of witches) like a pot!\"151 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE Kingdom through the Greco-Roman periods686 and is clearly the basis of the \"death by potsherd\" listed among the seventy potential causes of death nullified by Osiris in an oracular papyrus in Turin.687 Three millennia after the initial evidence of the Pyramid Texts, a third century papyrus from Oxyrhynchus provides perhaps the final echoes of the rite, preserved not in Egyptian but Greek. The papyrus contains the fragments of \"The Potter's Prophecy,\" an apocalyptic tale translated from Demotic that foretells the foreign conquest of Egypt and its ultimate salvation. The motivation for the prophecy is the impious seizure of the titular potter, a divine representative, and the breaking of his pots.688 Here the traditional destruction of foreign enemies by the breaking of pots has taken an ironic turn, for in this text it is the Egyptians themselves who have abrogated justice and become strangers to the gods. As a result, they bring about their own destruction by unwittingly re-enacting the ancient ceremony.689 Although the Berlin bowls showed unmistakable signs of intentional breakage,690 later discoveries of execration figurines seemed to reveal only accidental damage and led to a 686. E.g., the curse in O. Gardiner 49 (= HO 7, 1), with a vignette in which the magician(?) holds a small object (the ostracon?) before Renenutet and Nepri (Cerny and Gardiner 1957, p. 2). For the use of ostraca in Demotic and Greek spells, see J. H. Johnson 1975, p. 41 and Preisendanz 1931, p. 171 (PGM XXXVI, 11. 256-64 = Betz 1986, p. 275) plucked from the crossroads as in the imagery of the Horus cippi; and Betz 1986, pp. 282 (PGM XLVI, 11. 4-8), and 321 (PGM CXXIV)-for which see the discussion in Maltomini 1979, p. 103. For the presence of ostraca (in contrast to pots subsequently broken) in the Mirgissa deposit, see below, p. 153. 687. Papyrus Turin 1995+1996 to understand the reference to execration magic: \"Some of these potential agents of death seem quite innocuous: how a potsherd, for instance, ... can be the cause of death is not evident. The reading of the word rendered \u00ab<potsherd>> seems quite unambiguous, unless it be a textual corruption of some totally different word\" (p. 24). A fuller translation of this decree by Osiris appears in Borghouts 1978, pp. 4-6 (no. 9). For the current inventory number of this text, see Borghouts 1987b, p. 262; contra idem 1978, p. 119 (no. 9), where it is identified as Pap. Turin 1993 [23]. 688. Although the actual reference to the breaking of the pots is restored, the preserved context justifies the restoration. The pots are snatched (anaodtpevot, 1. 15) from an oven which is later described as \"desolate\" (iplgta0ok tat, 1. 56). For the text, see Lobel and Roberts 1954, pp. 89-99.

The relation of the events in the frame story of the prophecy to the ritual \"breaking of the red vases\" has not been previously recognized. 689. An echo of the rite may have survived into modem times; cf. the modem Arabic expression bitiksar 'ulla waraah, \"You break a pot behind him,\" meaning \"good riddance!\" said of an unwelcome guest after his departure (personal communication, Everett Rowson). 690.

THE MIRGISSA DEPOSIT Roughly contemporary with the Berlin bowls (mid Twelfth Dynasty),695 the Mirgissa deposit directly parallels both the material and the text of this earlier find. But while the Berlin collection, purchased from a Luxor dealer, was incomplete and without context, the in situ Mirgissa assemblage has revealed a rite far richer in both the quantity and complexity of its elements. For the \"deposit\" actually comprises four separate but related interments involving 197 broken inscribed red vases (and ostraca)-as compared with 80 in Berlin-in addition to 437 broken uninscribed red vases, 346 assorted mud figures, 3 limestone prisoner figurines with the head of a fourth, and the remains of a human 691. Posener (1940, pp. 19-20) noted that the breakage of the Brussels figurines was accidental. But in 1939b, p. 45, he suggested that the burial of figurines constituted a parallel ceremony to that of the breaking of the red vases. Both breaking and burial were features of the Giza ritual (Osing 1976a, p. 156 [figures broken prior to deposition in pot and burial]). 692. Ritual breaking of these figures was suggested by J&quier 1940, pp. 26-29 but denied Lauer and Leclant 1969. See now Verner 1985, p. 149. 693. See the remarks of Heimer 1981, p. 137, \"... les rites d'envofltement n'impliquaient nile by paleography and onomastica; for the date of the deposit, see Posener 1966, p. 279 and Koenig 1990, p. 102. The Mirgissa find is dated slightly anterior to the Berlin bowls, being thus contemporary with the construction of the fortress.153 oi.uchicago.eduTIlE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE sacrifice.696 Comparable to a foundation deposit,697 though probably interred well after the erection of the fortress in an official act of consecration,698 the Mirgissa assemblage had provided a magical safeguard for the inhabitants of the adjacent second cataract fortress. By virtue of its undisturbed condition, it provides the modem scholar with the most detailed evidence for actual ritual practice associated with the \"breaking of the red vases.\" Its very complexity, however, militates against its being considered the representative deposit for execration rites in general. For while scattered finds from the comparable sites of Uronarti and Shelfak could corroborate the existence of a similar, standardized rite for the Nubian fortresses of the Middle Kingdom,699 intact deposits within Egypt from the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms are manifestly not identical,700 and the Saite descendant of the Mirgissa rite, at the fortress of Defennah, consisted only of some thirty to forty limestone prisoner figurines, buried and often broken (see fig. 13b).701 Nonetheless, many of the elements of the Mirgissa deposit recur in differing combinations within the less complex variations of the rite, and it is as an index against which to compare these variations that the Mirgissa assemblage is most valuable. Situated some 600 meters from the fortress itself, the deposit lay within a small sandy depression beside a granite outcrop well removed from the normal thoroughfares of the fort and its adjacent town. Vila, the discoverer and excavator of the deposit, has attempted to explain its placement by suggesting that the Egyptians adhered to a hypothetical list of 696. The revised tabulation of pots and figures appears in Vila 1973, p. 630. 697. The magical intent of these ancestors to modern cornerstones is clearly demonstrated in the deposit of clay disks recovered from the Middle Kingdom Nubian fortresses of Kuban, Buhen, Areika, and Uronarti (contemporary with the Mirgissa assemblage) which depict Egyptian soldiers leading bound (Nubian) enemies (Siave-Sderbergh 1941, pp. 132-35 and Posener 1958, p. 254). Although, Posener (ibid.) doubts that there could be \"une relation quelconque avec les figures d'envoutement,\" the identity of purpose in the two rites is obvious: the eternization of the destruction and subjugation of Egypt's enemies. For subsequent Nubian adaptations of such seal types (reversing the ethnicity of captor and captive) during their tenure of these fortresses in the Second Intermediate Period, see B. Williams 1985, p. 45. 698. For the relatively late installation of the deposit, see Vila 1973, p. 634. 699. See Vila 1973, pp. 638-39, in regard to Dunham and pls. 31C-E, 64C. 700.

See also the additional references in Posener 1987, p. 4.154 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES requirements which only this site would have fulfilled: isolation from the disruptive factors of traffic, protection against natural erosion, and burial in sand.702 While the first two desiderata are logical enough as practical considerations for the preservation of the deposit, the preference for burial in sand-despite the ready abundance of granite strata and trained stone-cutters703-detracts from this protection and must be explained on other grounds. Although unrecognized by Vila, the significance of the sand is not far to seek, deriving not from practical but from religious considerations. SAND By virtue of its early appearance from the receding flood waters, sand was intimately associated with the creation of the Egyptian cosmos,704 and hence with all creative acts. As a purifying substance, sand is thus used in the foundations (and foundation deposits) of temples and sanctuaries,705 is ritually strewn during processions of the gods706 and private magical rites,707 is offered to deities,708 and even serves in the composition of divine 702. See Vila 1963, p. 140 and 1973, p. 628. 703. Compare the remarks of Vila 1963, p. 140. 704.

See above, p. 151 and n. 685.156 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES may come to symbolize the prostrate enemy of the \"prisoner motif,\" trampled beneath the sacred objects.722 Not only whole figures of enemies are replaced by sand, but also sections of them. Thus the intentional mutilation of potentially threatening hieroglyphic images (snakes, lions, men, etc.) found on occasion in burial chambers may be accomplished by carving the sign in halves with grains of sand between them: 46 effectively preventing their reunification.723 This method of destruction is repeated in the first Demotic romance of Setna Khamuas, when the hero defeats the self-regenerating \"eternal snake\" only by placing sand between its severed sections.724 While all of these nuances may have contributed to the selection of a sandy burial for the Mirgissa execration texts-the use of sand as a cosmic foundation, the significance of sand in burial, its crippling effect in the face of the figurines, the transformation of the enemy to a harmless pebble, and the rendering permanent of magical dismemberment-it is the final nuance which seems most directly significant for the ritual shattering of foreign enemies. INCINERATION As deduced from the excavation, the scenario of the Mirgissa ritual began with the digging of an oval pit 68 cm deep in the form of a truncated cone (increasing in diameter from 100 to 200 cm). Into this pit were placed five unbroken crucibles of dried mud, duplicates of the crucible used for copper smelting which Petrie had recovered from the turquoise mines at Serabit el Khadem.725 Although the significance of these objects at Mirgissa has yet to be noted, there can be little doubt but that they represent the \"furnace of the coppersmiths\" (mn.t n.t hmty.w var. ww?, \"furnace\") specifically stipulated by the 722. While New Kingdom rituals equate sand with the Eye of Horus (see above n. 708), the Ptolemaic ritual adds also the notion of defeated enemies (Chassinat 1932, p. 105 [text without translation]): \"Offering sand. Recitation: Sand is for you; I have elevated to your face the Eye of Horus in offering to your ka, so that you might have power over the misery in Heliopolis after you have punished the confederates of the hippo (Seth).\" 723. For these mutilations, see Lacau 1914 and Lexa 1925, vol. 3, pl. 71. The grains of sand may indicate the separate burial of the two halves. 724. Setna I, col. 3/33, in Lichtheimn 1980, p. 130.

See further Davey 1985.157 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE \"Apophis Book\" for the incineration of wax figures of enemies.726 The ritual burning of such figures, as a cultic analog to executions on earth727 and in the underworld,728 is a commonplace of temple practice,729 and permanent furnaces attached to temples for this purpose have been excavated at Tanis and possibly at Bubastis.730 A similar motivation should explain the unique use of baked clay plaques in a New Kingdom execration rite from Giza, despite objections by their editor that the figures were fired before being inscribed, and thus could not sympathetically effect the victim.731 Magical practice does not begin only with the finished image; no less significant for the identification of image and object are the materials and procedures used in the preparation of figures.732 Once identified with the fired plaques, the victims of the Giza rite are \"sympathetically\" burned nonetheless-not as incinerated inscribed figures, but as inscribed incinerated figures. Magically speaking, the effect is the same.733 In private magic, burning is similarly used for torturing substitute figures of individuals to be mastered, and in the Greco-Roman and Coptic periods the heating element of public baths (ito ou6atpo) substitutes for the temple 726.

Ugaritic parallels are noted in Rtiterswcirden 1976. 730. The furnace at Tanis is unmistakable, with clay images of bound prisoners at the cardinal points (Yoyotte 1973, p. 85). A furnace at Bubastis for \"amulets and ushebtis\" may have served a similar role (Vachala 1976). 731. Posener 1958, p. 255. 732.

Compare(?) the prohibition of fired wax in PGM IV, II. 2378 and 2945; Preisendanz 1928, pp. 146-47 and ritual crucible.734 At Mirgissa, the number of crucibles corresponds directly to the number of sections of the execration texts, with one each for the Asiatics, Nubians, Libyans, Egyptians, and evil things. Perhaps associated with this ritual burning are the ashes found in various levels of the central deposit and the remains of melted red wax found beside the skull of the sacrificial victim.735 The central rite entailed, of course, the breaking of the red pots. From the fracture markings on the reconstructed vessels, it is clear that Sethe's original suggestion was correct, and that the pots were broken by percussion with a striker, perhaps the stone spheroid found near the top of the central deposit.736 Both inscribed and uninscribed red pots were broken, with the latter predominating (at the ratio of one inscribed sherd to ten uninscribed sherds at the bottom, one to twenty at the top). The preponderance of uninscribed vessels should not be dismissed as simply \"filler,\" for it is their presence which firmly links the execration rite with the \"breaking of the red pots\" performed in funeral and temple ceremony.737 Although the only enemies that the fortress would have been likely to face were Nubians, the entire execration formula was nonetheless systematically copied by several scribes, with a complete series apportioned over as many as four vessels.738 Some preference does seem to have been shown to the Nubian section, however, for it is the only text currently identified at all levels of the deposit.739 FIGURINES At seven regular intervals, the stream of broken pottery was interrupted by the casting into the pit of a standard collection of mud figures comprising a severed human head or 734. This is especially common in spells of love compulsion or separation (see Bell, Nock, and Thompson 1933, p. 23 [cooking a lizard] and J. H. Johnson 1975, pp. 38-41). For the use of the bathhouse furnace in Demotic, Greek, and Coptic texts, compare J. 44-45 48-49); idem 1931, pp. 21 (PGM VII, 1. 469), 165 (PGM XXXVI, 1. 75), and 176 (PGM XXXVIII, 1. 3); and Kropp 1930-31, vol. 1, pp. 51-52 vol. 2, p. 32 (K 25, 38: T6OK6 NTIClthyNC), and compare vol. 1, p. 61 and vol. 2, p. 47 (M 95, requiring water from a bath for a curse). Excavated examples from the spring at Bath are discussed in Cunliffe 1983, p. 20. Perhaps from these immolations derive the \"bath demons\" in Roman folklore (see Bonner 1932 and Alcock 1982). 735. For the ashes, see the remarks of Vila 1973, pp. 629 and 637 (who notes the possibility of ritual incineration, but fails to link this with the crucibles) and 1963, p. 144.

The resultant destructions correspond precisely to the very purpose of the Nubian fortresses as expressed by Sesostris III: \"to prevent any Nubian from passing it downstream or overland or by boat, (also) any herds of Nubians.\"742 The figures of wild animals (reptiles, geese) are equally explicable as well-known symbols of the demonic forces of chaos believed to threaten the Egyptian cosmos through the medium of foreign eenemies.743 The relationship between wild animals and foreign enemies is thus an intimate one in Egyptian symbolism (both may personify disease744), and the two images are regularly coupled in ritual scenes of hunting, trampling, and 740. See Vila 1973, pp. 635-36 and 1963, pp. 156-59. 741.

If correctly interpreted, compare the blinding of enemies by sand in nn. 715-17, above. The figures may, however, be representations of bows. As many of the mud figures were reduced to powder by the impact and weight of the sherds, it would be quite possible that one more of this type had existed, and that they symbolized Egypt's traditional enemies, the \"Nine Bows.\" 742.

A brief discussion and bibliographical synopsis is found in Wildung 1977c. The transformation of the confederates of Seth into animals is stated directly in the \"Legend of the Winged Disk\": \"Now the foes descended into the water and became crocodiles and hippopotami,\" in Fairman 1935, p. 29. Elsewhere, the demons become snakes, birds, fish, lions, etc. See Kees 1942; Fairman 1960, pp. 102-03. These demons also assumed human form as opponents of the kingdom: \"Their forms came to be as humans within Heliopolis, with the children of their children up to today\" (Schott 1929, pp. 64-65, 11. 3-6). For the equation of wild animals with the political enemies of the king, see Malinine 1934; Schott 1956, pp. 184-85; and in which sacrificed enemies are \"carried like goats on the night of the feast of the Evening Sacrifice on which braziers are kindled.\" Compare also the pairing of theriomorphic confederates of Apophis with \"all the (human) enemies in the \"Apophis Book\" (cols. 32/6-12 and 32/13-33/18), in 1933, pp. 87-93 and 1938, pp. 46 and 52-53, and the plaque, presumably designed for an execration rite, depicting Seth and an Asiatic bound back to back at a stake in Michailides 1968, p. 82 (here fig. 19a, p. 212, below). The authenticity of this piece is not questioned in the otherwise critical review by Bingen 1969, p. 163. 744. See the examples gathered in Serensen 1984, pp. 13-14 (nn. 40-41).160 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES offering.745 The presence of both in the Mirgissa deposit confirms the theological/magical orthodoxy of the rite, and the use of flying geese as symbols of the Nubian threat is particularly interesting as it is directly paralleled in the second Demotic tale of Setna Khamuas in which a Nubian sorcerer and his mother assume precisely that form to evade capture by the Egyptians.746 Completing the inventory of mud figures, two isolated models of an ax and a brick recall similar figures from foundation deposits.747 Explanation may also be possible for the unidentified \"lenticular\" objects if these are to be associated with the clay balls (bnn.t) thrown to repel Seth, Apophis, and foreign enemies in temple ritual.748 Of the activity at the central deposit little more can be noted, except to remark that even the number of repetitions of casting the mud figures into the pit was not without meaning, for the significance of seven as the \"number of efficacy\" in Egyptian theology and \"magico-religious\" ritual is unmistakable.749 Eleven meters from the central deposit was found the second standard component of the execration ritual: the buried figurines of four bound prisoners, corresponding to the four 745. For discussion, see Junker 1955; with which compare Nelson 1931, pp. 12-21. For ritual hunting, compare also Alliot 1946.

The ax could, of course, refer specifically to the destruction of the conjured enemies. 748. For this rite, see Goyon 437-39; adding Raven 1982, p. 24. A suggested link between this ritual and the Mirgissa finds is now suggested also by Koenig 1987a, p. 311, n. 10. 749. The number seven figures prominently in Egyptian theology in the seven Hlathors who decree fate, the seven creative utterances who begat fate (ts, var. dis, discussed above, pp. 46-47), the seven uraei who guard Re, the seven gates of the underworld palace of Osiris, the seven horns of the goddess of writing, et cetera. Perhaps influenced by these associations with deities of creation and authority, the number abounds in religious and magical literature from the Pyramid Texts through the Coptic period. In the Coffin Texts alone, the number appears in spells 164, 398, 401,406-09, 1011, 1027, et cetera. Steadily increasing in importance, the symbolism of the number seven acquires cosmopolitan influence in the Hellenistic period from the seven vowels (Greek) and seven planets (Mesopotamian); for which see the references in Ritner 1984b, p. 218.

Corresponding injuries on Brussels figurines, pierced by three holes in the crown of the head, probably attest to a similar practice at Saqqara.752 At Mirgissa, yet further ritual striking must have occurred, for although the group was undisturbed, one of the figurines was found reduced to small fragments. This suspicion is confirmed by the Old Kingdom deposits from Giza in which the clay figures were shattered before their burial in jars.753 The single head may derive from a similar destruction prior to burial, or (like the mud head in the central pit?) allude to the sacrificed Nubian, whose severed skull constitutes the major component of the third deposit.754 HUMAN SACRIFICE It is the content of this third deposit which yields the most curious and unexpected element of the Mirgissa find, for it provides the first indisputable evidence for the practice 750. By virtue of its association with the cardinal directions, four is the most common symbol of \"completeness\" in Egyptian numerological symbolism and ritual repetition (Sethe 1916, pp. 31-33). For the common ritual use of four enemy figurines, see the examples discussed in Parker, Leclant, and Goyon 1979, pp. 61-65. Although four is the expected number of figures, an illegal excavation at Helwan(?) produced five alabaster examples later acquired by the Cairo Museum (see Posener 1939a, pp. 313-17; and the complete publication in idemrn 1987). Though the five figures could correspond to the sections of the execration litany, Posener posits the original existence of a sixth for symmetry (1939a, p. 314). The preserved figures contain duplicate copies of all but the first (Nubian) section, which might have been copied on a lost, sixth statuette. 751. Vila 1973. p. 631 and 1963, p. 147. With this \"mutilation in production\" compare the argument for magical significance in the use of clay images fired prior to being inscribed, advanced above, p. 158. 752. Posener (1940, p. 19) notes that the careful placement of the holes argues against their being the result of later blows. However, he does not recognize that these could still represent intentional mutilation, and he theorizes instead that they might have been filled with hair, feathers, or knives. Of these suggestions, the last (itself a form of intentional mutilation) is the most likely, see below, p. 166. 753. See the comments of Osing 1976a, p. 156. 754. Versus the suggestion by Vila 1973, p. 638, that the head might be \"the conventional sign\" for commanding the decapitation of a real prisoner (an Egyptian counterpart to the ring of Herod in Wilde's Salome). One would expect that the rite had made use of four originally complete figurines; see n. 750, above, and now Koenig 1990, p. 101. The use of \"severed\" sculpted heads within the execration rites may have Old Kingdom antecedents in the so-called \"reserve heads\" that typically show disfigurement (Tefnin 1991).162 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES of human sacrifice in classical ancient Egypt.755 Interred about four meters from the central deposit, a skull rested upside down on one half of a broken pottery cup, its mandible missing and its upper jaw flush with the surface.756 About the skull were found small traces of beeswax dyed with red ochre, presumably the remnants of melted figurines.757 Although the cup which had probably once held the skull seemed naturally broken, perhaps as a result of burial, an intentionally shattered piece of inscribed red pottery 15 cm to the southeast clearly affiliated the find with the ritual of the central deposit. Lying a further 5 cm from this broken pottery was a flint blade, the traditional ceremonial knife for ritual slaughter.758 That the skull derived from a ritual sacrifice cannot be denied, as it was the initial discovery of a nearby decapitated and disarticulated skeleton which had led to the find of the execration assemblage.759 Clearly, the head had belonged to the adjacent body, which appeared less buried than discarded. Examination of the fragile remains suggested a Nubian origin for the sacrificed individual-a human counterpart to the broken enemy figurines.760 KNIVES The close correspondence between the destruction of such substitute images and the Mirgissa sacrifice is underscored by the design of clay figurines from Giza (Old Kingdom) and Saqqara (late Middle Kingdom) whose rudimentary modeling suggests the depiction of 755. This example resolves the issue, but is only briefly mentioned in the basic study by Yoyotte 1980-81, p. 58. See also above, p. 158, n. 727 and p. 160, n. 743. For the possibility of a comparable execration sacrifice at Meroe, compare Shinnie and Bradley 1981, p. 167 (a defleshed skull lacking its mandible placed in a temple wall). 756. Vila 1963, pp. 146-47 and 145, fig. 6; idem 1973, p. 631; and Koenig 1987a, p. 309 (fig. 4). 757. Vila 1973, p. 631, n. 15. 758. The use of flint (ds, cf. Wb 5: 485-86) for knives dates from Egyptian prehistory, providing the basic Egyptian term for knife (ds, literally \"flint object,\" cf. Wb 5: 486), and thus attaining traditional and sacred status. In the Book of the Dead, for example, it is specifically used against the enemies of the gods; see BD spell 172, \u00a7S5, in Allen 1974, p. 180: \"(your) nails like knives of flint against the faces of them that do these (things) against thee.\" Similarly, the \"Apophis Book\" stipulates that images of Apep be struck with knives of flint, compare Faulkner 1933, pp. 44-45 and 56 (cols. 22/20-23 and 26/4) and 1937b, pp. 168 and 171 (the significance of flint is ignored by Faulkner, who translates only \"knives\"). Flint knives are used as well in the cultic sacrifice of the oryx, like foreign enemies a symbol of Seth (see above, p. 132; see also Rochemonteix et al. 1984-87, p. 77/13-14 1962b, pp. 58/7 and 59). A divine pedigree for the weapon appears in Pap. Salt 825: \"A knife of flint from eastern Behdet is brought. It came forth from Ra to repel his enemies by means of it\" (Derchain 1965, pp. 139 and 7* [col. 6/5]). In light of this evidence, it is difficult to accept Vila's suggestion (1973, p. 638) that the flint blade was used only after a more merciful death by strangulation. 759.

Stamped with an image of a bleeding prisoner, the inscribed clay imprints are bisected at the neck by a knife drawn in red ink (see fig. 13c).762 The use of actual knives has been postulated for the Middle Kingdom figures in Brussels, whose pierced heads may have once been fitted with small daggers.763 From the same period, a formula to repel snakes in a Turin papyrus recommends the recitation of a spell \"over clay with a circle of knives in it.\"764 Transfixed by knives, such images of enemies and hostile creatures owe their ultimate origin not to ritual, but to the apotropaic mutilation of hieroglyphs in the Pyramid Texts, where potentially harmful signs are incapacitated by incomplete or bisected carving (discussed above, p. 157).765 The same rationale has been suggested for Old Kingdom representations of Seth, whose tail appears as an arrow piercing his hindquarters (see fig. 14a),766 and the intention is certain in images of crocodiles with heads struck by arrows in carvings of the First Intermediate Period and the Middle Kingdom (see fig. 14b).767 761.

In is said to be \"of Isis.\" Coitra Sorensen 1984, p. 12, the knives are not the teeth of the snake \"rendered harmless in the clay,\" and the association of Isis with clay is not \"otherwise unknown.\" Rather, the spell anticipates the events of the later-attested anti-snake spell \"Isis and the name of Re,\" in which Isis molds a snake of earth and Re's spittle (Pap. Turin Pleyte and Rossi, pis. 131/11-133/14, 133/31, and 77/1-5); for editions and translations, see the sources cited in n. 337, above. This clay serpent is \"detoxified\" by Isis when Re reveals to her his secret name. As in this later spell, the clay in Pap. Turin 54003 should represent the serpent modeled by (and subject to) Isis. Encircled and pierced, the clay-and thus the serpent-is destroyed. 765. See Lacau 1914. A beheaded serpent appears in CT spell 493 (= de Buck 1956, p. 74). The various methods of mutilation grouped together in Lexa 1925. vol. 3, pl. 71, fig. 162b, are from differing historical periods. Incomplete carving may also appear in a private tomb of the Old Kingdom, see the crocodile carved without legs in the tomb of Khuenankh, in Quibell 1902, p. 258; suggested by Gilliam 1983. Isolated examples of bisected carving appear even in the Greco-Roman periods, compare Sauneron 1982, p. 151, no. 187 (demon carved in halves). 766. See Borchardt 1909 and the discussion of te Velde 1977, pp. 16--17. Further Old Kingdom examples appear in Piankoff 1969. pls. 62 (1. 54) and 67 (1. 1 11) (reference courtesy Henry G. Fischer). 767. On the nome standard of Dendera (see Fischer 1961, Kingdom stela at Leiden]). Spiegelberg's explanation of the magical significance of the arrow accords perfectly with the development of magical mutilation, and should be accepted despite Fischer's uncertainty. With these depictions should be compared the contemporary Brussels figurines also pierced in the head. See also the late carving at the temple of Dendera of the crocodile on the nome standard clearly pierced with arrows, in Mariette 1873, pl. 33. top right (with which ef. the snake pierced by a knife on pl. 34, top middle).164 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES Appearing also in the Middle Kingdom is the first common use of the image of a knife for such mutilations: .768 By the New Kingdom, these sketched knives are used not only on the execration seals noted above, but are affixed in multiples on images of Apep both in mythological scenes and, following the practice of the Pyramid Texts, when used as a hieroglyph (see figs. 14c and 14d).769 In the Late Period, determinatives of both Seth and Apep are regularly mutilated (see figs. 14e and 14f),770 and at Dendera the mythological execution of Seth follows the now traditional pattern (see fig. 14g).77' Repeatedly stabbed, such images of Apophis, and later Seth, derive from the merger of symbol and rite. Reflecting the multiple wounds inflicted on figures of these demons in the regular performance of temple cult,772 they are at once apotropaic design and textual vignette illustrating written cultic incantations: \"A knife is fixed in his head before Re daily.\"773 The quite obvious significance of the imagery survives well into the Roman period, when it reappears on an amulet against the \"Evil Eye,\" shown pierced by a knife and two arrows (see fig. 14h).774 768. See Gardiner 1973, p. 457 (Sign-list D 57 used inter alia as the determinative of words for \"mutilation\") and Moller 1909a, p. 11 (no. 123, Twelfth Dynasty). Note also the seemingly contemporary origin of the expression hjry dnm.t (Wh 5: 450/16-18), \"sufferer,\" literally, \"he who is under the knife,\" first attested in Griffith 1898, p. 13 (prescription 2, 1. 51). For the standard use of the phrase in later magico-medical texts, see Jelinkovi-Reymond 1956, p. 15, n. 1. 769. Not only the practice, but the motivation of the Pyramid Texts is imitated in these New Kingdom mutilations which occur within tombs. For Apep thus slain in mythological scenes, see Hornung 1963, vol. 1: unnumbered plate of the seventh hour (see fig. 14c, below, p. 167) and vol. 2, p. 132. For knives in images of Apophis used as a determinative; see The Epigraphic Survey 1980, pp. 70-71 and pls. 20 (1. 8), 73, and 76 (1. 3; here as fig. 14d, below, p. 167) and Helck 1958a, p. 1850, Il. 6 and 10. A serpent determinative (for ddfy.t) is similarly stabbed on a Ramesside ostracon in Gardiner and Cerny 1957, pl. 3, 2 (line 3), though its contemporary textual parallel in Pap. Turin Pleyte and Rossi, pl. 131/13, is uninjured. Ramesside examples appear also in the magical Pap. Chester Beatty 7, col. 5/5 and among the vignettes on the verso (Gardiner 1935, vol. 2, pls. 34, 38, and 38a). 770. For Apep, compare Moller 1909b, p. 23, no. 249 and 1912, p. 23 (Pap. Bremner-Rhind, passim). Similar representations of Seth appear in Pap. Bremner-Rhind, cols. 2/10, 2/17, 5/2, 7/3,13/23, and 23/14-15, in Faulkner 1933, passim and in the ritual texts in Schott 1929, passim. Seth and Apophis are both carved with knives at the temple of Hibis (Norman de Garis Davies 1953, pl. 20, North Wall [Seth] and pl. 25 [Apophis]). 771. See Mariette 1873, pl. 56a (= Porter and Moss 1939, p. 98, no. 58). The scene is a vignette for the tenth hour of the \"Mystery of Osiris in Khoiak\"; for the text, see Junker the \"Apophis 5 and 47/17-49/17; and the \"Play of Horus,\" with its ritual harpooning of a hippopotamus image prior to the slicing of a hippopotamus cake, in Fairman 1974.

Delatte and Derchain 1964, pp. 72-73.165 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE Translated from the two dimensions of papyrus and relief to the three dimensions of actual practice on small figurines, these clusters of knives find a ready equivalent in the common needle or nail, obvious \"miniature knives.\"775 As a method of \"killing\" images, repeated nail blows are attested as early as the Second Intermediate Period,776 and needles or nails may have already served as \"knives\" on the Middle Kingdom figures in Brussels noted above. Directly paralleling contemporary temple imagery, this method is adopted by private magic in the Greco-Roman periods, appearing in both Demotic and Greek language execration spells-and the infamous Louvre figurine.777 The material specified for the composition of these nails is either copper, used by Isis and Horus against Seth, or iron, a mineral associated in Egyptian sources with Seth and the weapon which he used against Apophis.778 The selection of these minerals in private texts is quite purposeful, using 775. The practice is quite familiar in the West; compare the ubiquitous European parallels discussed by the antiquarian Elsworthy 1958, pp. 53-58 and 84-85. Such familiarity can be misleading, however, and the Egyptian understanding of even this common magical technique should not be taken for granted without careful examination of Egyptian evidence. Parallel practice in differing cultures may disguise the most contrary of meanings; contrast the Coptic amulet for the protection of a house (seventh- eighth centuries) published in Wortmann 1968, p. 107. In the form of a tabula ansata, the amulet bears the inscription \"One is God, the helper of Julios,\" and is pierced with eighteen nail holes (not used for attachment). The nails were certainly not intended to \"kill\" the amulet; they seem to form a K.ipa \"incline,\" a standard device for reducing sickness. See Betz 1986, p. 3 and passim. Similarly deviant from the expected norm are the \"nail fetishes\" (nkisi) of the Kongo peoples of Africa. These wooden spirit figures with compartments for \"medical\" substances are pierced by numerous nails and blades to enhance their power, not to slay them. First recorded in 1818, these figures may have been influenced by Christian icons of the suffering Christ and saints (particularly St. Sebastian); for discussion, see Gillon 1984, pp. 283-85 and de lleusch 1968, pp. 77ff. 776. A cultic plaque of king Neferhotep of the Thirteenth Dynasty was \"killed by nail imprints\" (Bietak 1981, p. 273 and pl. 35b). 777. A Demotic spell for compelling a demon uses a three-lobed pod of garlic pierced by three iron needles (Griffith and Thompson 1904, pp. 66-67 [col. 8/171]). For Meroitic use of nails to pierce inscribed bronze figures, see Kendall 1982, pp. 55-56. An Old Coptic example IBT' NBCNIf\"E, appears in Preisendanz 1928, pp. 72-73 (PGM IV, 1. 110).

Decapitation (hsq, UP, ) appears as a constant threat by demons in the Coffin Texts, and the deceased thus styles himself prophylactically \"the living one who knits on heads, who makes necks firm,\" while the Book of the Dead provides a safeguarding \"Spell for a Secret Head\" so that \"thy head can never be taken from thee.\"779 The fear of \"going upside down\" (shd, j )-entailing the reversal of bodily functions and the forced consumption of excrement and urine-is especially prominent in the Coffin Texts, themselves roughly contemporary with the Mirgissa deposit, and this posture reappears in the royal funerary compositions of the New Kingdom in which it is reserved for depictions of the damned in Hell.780 These later texts are of particular interest for the study of the Mirgissa execration rite as they also combine directly the tortures of decapitation and reversal. Thus in the Book of Caverns, the deceased king proclaims: Oh beheaded ones, without their heads, foremost of the place of destruction! Oh fallen ones, without their bas, foremost of the place of destruction! Oh overturned ones, fettered ones, foremost of the place of destruction! Oh overturned ones, bloody ones deprived of hearts, foremost of the place of destruction! Oh enemies of the ruler of the underworld, Osiris Foremost of the West, behold I have commanded you to destruction! I have assigned you to non-existence!781 The accompanying illustration in the tomb of Ramses VI corresponds exactly to this description, showing decapitated bodies and severed heads as well as enemies falling and upside down-all in sets of four, paralleling the four limestone figures in the second 779.

For the threat of beheading, see Zandee 1960, pp. 16-17 and 226 and Hornung 1968, pp. 18-19 and pl. 3.

For reversal, see Zandee 1960, pp. 73-78; Hornung 1968, and Kadish 1979, pp. 209ff. The upside down depiction of a Hittite prince pulled from the water in the Kadesh victory reliefs of Ramses II probably puns on this standard posture of tortured spirits; for the scene, see Kuentz 1928, pl. 40. For a cross-cultural analysis of the significance of being upside down, see J. Z.

Salt 825; and and compare 1942a, p. 11 and pl. 9.168 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES Mirgissa deposit.782 The association of these punishments is equally evident in the eleventh hour of the Book of Amduat (\"What is in the Underworld\"), when the opponents of Re and Osiris are ritually slaughtered at the command of Horus: The majesty of this god issues commands to cut up ... the corpses of the enemies and the bodies of the dead, the upside down ones who are hindered from moving.783 Your heads are cut off. You cannot come into being, for you are upside down.784 Nor is the similarity exhausted by the pairing of these punishments, for the netherworldly Amduat rite reproduces the execration ritual's burning of the severed enemies (substituting deceased spirits for wax figurines), and duplicates even the location of the act, with destruction and burial in sandy pits (h :d) in the desert.785 In fact, so closely does the Amduat rite evoke the ceremony at Mirgissa that in essence they are identical, comprising the incineration, decapitation, dismemberment, overturning, and burial of enemy figures. Only the form of the victims-not their identities-distinguishes the two rites, with simulacra (pots or figurines) on earth replaced by spirits in the underworld.786 Common to both is the human corpse, condemned in the netherworld by Horus, and in Mirgissa by Horus' earthly incarnation, the pharaoh. The implications of this similarity are clear: the ritual destruction envisioned in the text of Amduat must derive from genuine earthly 782. Piankoff 1942a, pl. 10. 783. See Hornung 1963, vol. 1, pp. 188-91 and vol. 2, pp. 180-83 (quote in vol. 1, p. 188 and vol. 2, p. 180). Compare the recitation in the Late Period ritual quoted in Schott 1956, 1963, vol. 1, p. 189 and vol. 2, p. 181. Beheading appears also in the seventh hour, see ibid., vol. 1, unnumbered plate. 785. Hornung, ibid., vol. 2, pp. 180 and 65 and 1968, pp. 21-29 and pls. 2 and 5 (burning), and p. 23 (pit). Note that the four goddesses who direct the destruction, one of whom is named \"She-who-is-over-her- sand,\" all wear the symbol for desert atop their heads. With these deities compare the four goddesses in Ziegler 1979; adding Raven 1982, p. 24. 786. Minor variations exist as well. By virtue of the greater number of victims, the Amduat scene shows six pits with whole bodies reversed and the severed heads upright. With only one sacrifice at Mirgissa, one pit is sufficient and the head must be both severed and reversed.169 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE ceremonies similar, if not identical, to the execration ritual.787 The royal funerary texts are thus in reality neither exclusively royal nor funerary, but derive-at least in part-from state rituals performed by the priesthood in public788 for earthly benefit.789 The influence of such ritual upon the iconography of the damned continues into the Late Period. In Papyrus Jumilhac, Seth is depicted upside down in a pit beneath the throne of Osiris, a demonic counterpart to the human enemies of the royal tombs and the Mirgissa sacrifice (see fig. 15a).790 The dependence of underworld tortures upon the execration rite is logical enough, as both are primarily symbolic performances. Nonetheless, it should not be forgotten that the execration rite is itself derivative of actual public executions whose capital punishments it re-enacts. Decapitation is already attested in the predynastic Narmer palette, and refer- ences to public incineration are increasingly frequent in later Egyptian history.791 \"Over- turning\" appears in the biography of the Eighteenth Dynasty vizier Rekhmire, who declares that he \"caused the liars and thieves(?) to be upside down.\"792 From context, it is unclear whether this describes a genuine torture or is a derived metaphor paralleling the English 787. A vestige of this ritual origin is perhaps to be noted in the description of the divine executioners \"who perform mrnsw, 34 b, among the enemies of Osiris\"; Hornung 1963, vol. 1, p. 191. Although conventionally translated \"slaughter\" in the religious texts to which it is generally confined, tnmsw means literally \"redness\" (especially in reference to hostile red ink, see Wb 5: 370/2-6) and readily evokes the ancient ritual of the red vases. As a reference to the magical red ink of this and similar rites, tmsw may be the Egyptian term for \"ritual execration\" rather than a rare expression for \"slaughter.\" For related nuances of tmns as Sander-Hansen 1937, p. 58 (1. 133): \"She is not reckoned (to) the Book of tmsw (execration list?).\" Alternatively, Gardiner has suggested that this writing may serve as the antecedent of the Coptic T&OMC, \"to bury\" (1925, p. 74). 788. The site of the ceremony at Mirgissa was in direct view of the occupied fortress, and the rite could thus not have been performed secretly; see the remarks of Vila 1973, pp. 634-35. 789. For the adaptation of the \"royal funerary literature\" from earthly rites, see Wente 1982, pp. 161-79. The apparent relationship of the Amduat ritual with Middle Kingdom practice provides further evidence for maintaining the traditional dating of these \"underworld texts\" to the Middle Kingdom or First Intermediate Period; for the controversy, see Wente ibid., pp. 175-76 rejoinder in Homrnung 1980, 9. 790.

Westcar, execution by burning is attributed to the Third Dynasty (Simpson, Faulkner, and Wente 1973, p. 18, col. 4/9-10); in official statements it appears at least as early as the Thirteenth Dynasty; see Randall-Maclver, Mace, and Griffith 1902, p. 93 and pl. 29/6: \"whoever shall be found within these stelae except a priest in the execution of his duty shall be burnt.\" For later examples, see Posener 1985, pp. 32-33. 792. Gardiner 1925, pp. 70-71, who does not make the restoration of t [,'.w, \"thieves\"; compare Wb 5: 350/2-10.170 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES \"overthrow.\" No such uncertainty obscures the fate of the seven Asiatic captives slain in the succeeding reign by king Amenhotep II: \"they being placed head downwards at the prow of His Majesty's ship.\"793 The posture is not accidental; as in the execration and funerary rites it signifies-and creates-the \"overthrow\" of the enemy and his \"every evil word, every evil plot, every evil fight,\"794 et cetera. Performed after the death of the ene- mies, the act of overturning is here of magical and symbolic significance, a \"backfor- mation\" from ritual onto public execution.795 At Meroe, ritual and execution may again be conjoined in a political reversal of the earlier Egyptian rite at Mirgissa. Embedded within a temple wall, a defleshed and jawless skull lay behind a mural of bound prisoners, while a bronze head severed from a statue of Augustus was buried before the threshold.796 This reciprocity of imagery between execution and execration finds a distant echo in the praxis of a fifth century Greek magical papyrus which effects a curse by placing a pierced wax figurine upside down in a pot of water.797 At Mirgissa, the interdependence of rite and execution is expressed concretely-by the corpse of the human sacrifice. 793. Amada Stela, 1. 17; see Helck 1967, pls. 3 and 7; translation in Gardiner 1961, p. 199. 794. Compare Sethe 1926, pp. 71-72. 795. The suggestion of ritual motivation in this act is strengthened both by the fact that the king himself per- formed the execution, and by the mention of the king's having made \"execration figures\" (rs.t) of his enemies (1. 5, on which see below, p. 187). The passage (11. 16-17) describing the slaying of the chief- tains is grammatically ambiguous, and subject to two ?w.t-ib ds -sf, \"Joyfully, His majesty came to his father Amon after he had slain the 7 chieftains with his own mace\" (sm-.n f as circumstantial), or \"Joyfully, His majesty came to his father Amon. With his own mace he slew the 7 chieftains\" (smt.n.fas emphatic). The second interpretation seems preferable, producing a poetic parallel structure (two emphatic clauses) and explaining the seven victims as sacrifices before Amon in Thebes (cf. Breasted 1906, p. 313, though doubted by Yoyotte 1980-81, p. 37, n. 29). However, the first translation has been generally adopted, though it removes the reason for the king's return to Amon and would require that the victims' corpses had been hung from the royal ship for the entire journey back from Lebanon. As six bodies were subsequently suspended from the walls of Thebes and a seventh dispatched to Napata, one might wonder just what would have remained to display after such a journey. In fact, reliefs substantiate the display of living prisoners, probably destined for subsequent execution, suspended from ships in wooden cages (Karnak second pylon, reign of Tutankhamun; see Grimm 1987). For standard translations of the Amada pas- sage, see Helck 1961, p. 31 and Cumming 1982, p. 27. For a similar sacrifice performed by Osorkon II at Thebes, see Caminos 1958, pp. 48-51. The ritual aspect of a comparable execution within a literary tale is noted in Posener 1985, p. Shinnie and Bradley 1981, p. 167. Directed against Roman Egypt (among other enemies), the components of the ritual protection of the temple thus include decapitated human remains, a captured and decapitated image of the enemy ruler (Augustus), and painted imagery to eternize foreign subjection. 797.

BURIAL The final element of the Mirgissa assemblage consists only of this corpse, carelessly buried and largely ignored by its discoverer in his analysis of the execration rite.798 The significance of the corpse should not be too easily dismissed, however, for the major unifying characteristic of execration figures when found in situ has been their location in traditional cemeteries.799 At the virgin site of Mirgissa, no such local cemetery had existed; by the interment of the Nubian sacrifice an ad hoc burial ground was created. If the importance of burial in the rite is as great as its proponents have claimed,800 this requirement alone may have necessitated the human sacrifice. Be that as it may, the overriding significance of burial in the ceremony is unmistakable, for despite the prominence of dismemberment, burning, and other tortures, it is burial alone which unites the entire corpus of execration figures, whether inscribed or uninscribed, intact or 798. Vila 1973, pp. 628-29 and 631. 799. See the comments in Junker 1947, p. 38 and in Osing 1976a, p. 156. Of the execration figures with certain provenience, only one has come from a village rather than a necropolis site: a fragmentary figure inscribed in red found in the fill between two Old Kingdom levels at Balat (Posener-Kri6ger 1982, p. 384 and pl. 70B; Giddy 1983, p. 107; Grimal 1983, p. 111; and Posener 1939a, pp. 316-17. oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES mutilated.801 The same criterion may serve to identify an archaic wooden statuette in Boston as the earliest execration figure. Said to derive from the First Dynasty royal tombs at Abydos, the fragmentary Boston statuette is thus to be distinguished from the various figurines of the \"prisoner motif' recovered from the temple precinct at that site.802 Justification for the importance of burial has been based on neither royal nor temple sources, however, but on the rubric of Coffin Texts spell 37, a spell for vindication against personal enemies: To be spoken over a figure of the foe made of wax and inscribed with the name of that foe on his breast with the bone(?) of a synodontis fish: To be put in the ground in the abode of Osiris (scil. 'graveyard').803 What has not been noticed is that the entire spell is of relevance for the execration rite. Arguably a funerary adaptation of a common, \"private\" cursing ritual,80 the spell utilizes a standard Egyptian pattern of attributing impious acts and statements to one's enemies: See, that foe etc., who is among men and gods and the inhabitants of the necropolis, has come to break your house, to ruin your gate ... O Osiris, see that foe who is among men and who is in the necropolis has come, having joined with Seth ... he has said that your wounds are hidden, he has said: 'Sore be the pains of your suffering which are on you.' ... May you break and overthrow your foes and set them under your sandals.805 801. Compare also the two, presumably ritual, burials at the \"Augustus Temple\" at Meroe comprising a human skull and a severed bronze head from a statue of Augustus; Shinnie and Bradley 1981, p. 167. 802. For the statuette and its suggested identification as a kneeling prisoner, see W. S. Smith 1967. Smith does not, however, associate the sculpture with the execration figurines. 803. Faulkner 1973, p. 28 (= de Buck 1935, p. 157). Noted by Posener 1939a, p. 316. Although \"the foe\" could be equated with Seth, the identification is not specific and is certainly not restricted to Seth. As a spell against personal enemies, this text should be compared with the \"Apophis Book,\" col. 28/16-18, see below, p. 184. There is no justification for Posener's suggestion (1987, p. 11) that the burial of a figure of wax (rather than of clay) is \"6videmment un usage impropre.\" 804. Only the phrase, \"he having departed from(?) his companions upon earth\" (Faulkner 1973, p. 28 = de Buck 1935, pp. 153-54), requires a funerary setting and may be an interpolation. The translation of the phrase is uncertain, however, as most versions have \"laugh at\" rather than \"depart from.\" 805. Faulkner 1973, p. 28 (= de Buck 1935, pp. 154-56). For this common pattern, compare CT spells 656 (Faulkner 1977, p. 228 = de Buck 1956, pp. 277-78) and 837 (Faulkner 1978, p. 24 = de Buck 1961, p. 37) where the technique is attempted (without success) by Seth. Seth is himself the recipient of the process in Schott 1929, pp. 18-23 and his son Maga is likewise treated in Pap. Harris Magical, col. 9/5-13, in Lange 1927, pp. 80-81. The motif continues unchanged into the Egyptian papyri in Greek language, compare Preisendanz 1928, pp. 33-39 (PGM III, II. 1-164) 2707); (PGM XXXVI, II. 134-60); and passim. This is also the explanation for the alleged ritual cannibalism discussed in Brashear 1979, pp. 269-71 (NN is to be replaced by the name of the conjured victim). See further my comments in Betz 1986, p. 83, n. 314.173 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE Assimilated to the enemies of the gods, the foe is equally subjected to the breaking and felling of the state rite, if only by the simplified mechanism of the spoken curse. The use of \"etc.\" (hm.t-r?') after the mention of \"foe\" allows for the insertion of the name of the conjured enemy in the curse, and it is this personal enemy whose inscribed figure is buried. If the enemy, though \"among men,\" is also \"in the necropolis,\" it is because the burial of the ritual figurine has put him there.806 While the act of breaking or piercing has been shown to constitute a ritual \"killing\" of objects that they may be associated with the dead, the burial of such objects is an even more obvious method for producing this association. Its practice at funerals in all periods of Egyptian civilization is and was so commonly recognized that any ritual burial necessarily evoked this funerary context,807 with the dispatching of the buried object to the realm of the dead. That this is no less true for human images than for the more commonly offered foodstuffs or other grave goods is expressly shown in Coffin Texts spell 103, which is designed to send one's own soul from the earth to the underworld and is recited \"over an image of clay(?) ... [The name of] the man is to be placed upon it in the ground.\" 808 In the execration texts, the same result is produced, albeit with hostile intent. The actual depiction of this result appears in the \"mythological papyri,\" where dispatched foreign prisoners are bound beneath the throne of Osiris,809 and the essence of the ritual is embodied in the netherworld creature Nkiw-nnt, \"The Vanquished One at the Stake,\" a god shown as a bound foreign captive whose existence repels evil (see fig. 15b).810 The obvious association of this figure with the execration rite is underscored by his 806. Such phrases also allow for the possibility that the foe might be a god, demon, or dead man; see the standard recitation of potentially threatening beings in CT spells 47, 455, 585, etc. 807. This seems true even for agricultural rituals of plowing and planting; compare the \"hacking of the earth\" (hbs-t?, Wb 3: 256/1-7) performed at the sowing season for Sokar, god of the dead, discussed in Kees 1980, pp. 94-95; Gaballa Griffiths 1960, pp. 61-62 (construed as the burial of the blood of Seth's confederates). For the ritual in funerary literature, compare CT spell 146, in Faulkner 1973, p. 124 (= de Buck 1938, pp. 202-03) and BD spells 12, \u00a7S and 178b, \u00a7S, in Allen 1974, pp. 11 and 186. Planting is ritualized as burial in the \"corn Osiris\" figures, impregnated with seeds and interred (see Raven 1982). 808. Faulkner 1973, p. 101 (= de Buck 1938, p. 110). Both the content and rubric of the spell again suggest its origin in earthly practice, contra the suggestion of Faulkner 1973, p. 101, n. 1. For further ritual burials of enemies, see Gardiner 1935, vol. 1, p. 68 (Pap. Chester Beatty 8, cols. 4/5-5/3); Schott 1956; and particularly idem 1930c, in which one buries (fms) a wax or clay figure of a royal enemy under an execution site together with a papyrus sheet inscribed in fresh ink with the enemy's name and those of his father and mother (p. 41).

This notion of burial is enforced by the occasional use of clay coffins to enclose execration figurines,8 I and the coffining of divine, state, and personal enemies recurs within the cultic \"Apophis Book.\"812 More often, however, the same effect was created by placing the figurines and texts within a large jar, a practice attested in the more complex assemblages from the Old to the New Kingdoms.813 The use of jars as coffins is well known from the so-called \"Canopic jars,\" and is actually employed for burials of children and adults (as \"slipper-coffins\"814), continuing into the Late Period as the \"coffin of choice\" for embalmed sacred ibises.815 The significance of the practice for the execration ceremony is illustrated clearly in Coffin Texts spell 1016: Oh you who are hateful ... I put my hands on the jar in the bounds of which you sit; it descends before you.816 The hostile interment of personal enemies which is described in this spell finds its cultic analog in Papyrus Salt 825, whose \"magical\" nature has been the subject of much 811. As noted, for example, by Lansing (1933, pp. 23-25) at Lisht and by Posener (1939b, p. 41) and Capart (1940, p. 8) for certain Brussels figurines from Saqqara; see also the thorough listing in Posener 1987, pp. 3 (Saqqara and Lisht) and 5 Wasta or Atfih). 812.

Unread by the editor of the papyrus, the conclusion of the text is nonetheless clear: \"go round about it\" (phr h .f).821 The hostile encirclement (phr) thus enacted serves to re-enforce the constrictive nuance of binding and burial. The jar itself is the actor, physically \"going round about\" its victims. Not simply a utilitarian container of magical material, the jar is a direct participant in the execration process. The prominence of the jug in Papyrus Salt 825 has clear implications for the related dynastic occurrences; it also provides the textual correspondent of the jar burials associated with the Louvre figurine and other \"Greek\" spells of domination.822 Burial maintains its prominence as a magical technique in private ritual of the Greco- Roman (and Coptic823) eras, appearing in both Demotic and Greek spells for compelling 817. See above, pp. 6-7. 818. Derchain 1965, pp. 139 and 7*. With its dismembered, burned, and encased wax figures, the ceremony for the \"House of Life\" (like the underworld torture in the \"Book of Amduat\") readily reveals its origin in the execration rite, of which it is but a variation. The preservation of a small limestone plaque with identical imagery suggests that the scriptorium ritual may have produced its own variations, stressing the burial rather than the burning of images (see above, n. 743 and below, p. 212, here fig. 19a). 819. Derchain ibid., pp. 145 and 22*. Derchain's is unwarranted. 820. Derchain ibid., pp. 144 and 21*.

The first line should read pd .t .'d sm?, perhaps to be understood as \"the bowman, slaughtered and bound(?).\" Could sin, \"to unify\"(?) be a reference to the tying of prisoners to the unification symbol (smi?), or to the act of burial (smin-t?)? 822.

These instructions reveal that cemetery burial produces an association not simply with death, but with the dead. Charms, lamellae, and complex assemblages are to be interred in extant tombs, and written spells are placed on the corpse itself (often inserted in the mouth of the mummy), or even inscribed on a bone extracted from the cadaver.829 The spells address the spirit of the corpse directly: 826. PGM IV, 11. 380-83, in Preisendanz 1928. pp. Betz 1986, above, 119-36. 828. The result of such rituals and spells-whether temple, state, or private-is respect and fear, qualities united in the Egyptian concepts fy.t or q/7r, traditionally translated \"respect/prestige\"; for the asso- ciation of fear with these terms, see Wt 4: 457/12. 15, 17; and WI 5: 31-32.

The assemblage is buried beside a grave as the magician recites: \"And arouse yourself for me, whoever you are, whether male or female.\" For a representative Coptic example, see R6mondon 1953, pp. 157-61 (especially 1. 4, discussed on p. 160). With these practices should be compared a love charm inscribed in hieroglyphs on a figure representing a deceased woman, in Drioton 1942: \"Raise yourself, bind him whom I see that he might copulate (sin, \"join\") with me.

Re- editions of these spells have been prepared by myself for the Coptic Magical Papyri Project of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, Claremont. Curses are also deposited in tombs in Mesopotamia, see CAD, vol. 11/1, p. 206a, s.v. nidlu, \u00a7d: \"you (pl.) have placed figures of me with a dead man, you have placed figures of me in the lap of a dead man ....\" 830.

The classic studies of the defixiones are Wtinsch 1898 and Audollent 1904. The Egyptian iconography (\"Sethian\") and background of these texts is already recognized in these formative studies. For more recent examples and bibliography, see Jordan 1975 and 1985, especially pp. 165-67 for the burial of these tablets in older tombs. Jordan, however, fails to understand the reason for the presence of these tablets in tombs, assuming (pp. 165-66) that they had served the tomb owners as amulets in life and were buried \"as a treasured possession.\" On the contrary, the tablets found in tombs were deposited as a magical act on the behalf of living individuals well after the original burial, and never belonged to the tomb owner. The Egyptian element of the spell in the Vigna Codini tablet is discussed in Griffiths 1985. For an example from Autun in Burgundy, see Marcillet-Jaubert 1979. The (unrecognized) Egyptian origin of even this text is made manifest in the magical phrase KOMTIe (ibid., p. 185), garbled on the tablet from KOM4Q.C (ibid., p. 186), and deriving from the KOM TO of Crum 1939, p. 109a and Cerny 1976, 59 < KMTITO, Demotic Pap. London and Leiden, col. 7/6). A thorough discussion of this epithet appears in Thissen 1991, pp. 300-02. Egyptian influence on certain defixiones is now denied by Faraone 1985, p. 153, on the basis of their date (end of the fifth century B.C.). As should be clear, however, Egyptian antecedents long precede even these first Greek texts. 833. See Jordan 1985, p. 167. Again, Jordan is unaware of the Egyptian and PGM parallels (styling the placement \"unique\"), and thus doubts the excavation report unjustly.179 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE not Greek but Egyptian, deriving directly from the ancient native custom of private \"letters to the dead.\"834 LETTERS TO THE DEAD Attested from the Old Kingdom, these letters invoke the aid of the deceased in matters of health, fertility, fortune, and justice. The spirit may be petitioned in its own right as an \"effective spirit\" or ,h (a term related to the :h.w, \"spells\" over which the deceased has mastery), reflecting the Egyptian belief in the power of the dead to influence persons and events:835 Please become a spirit (:th) for me [before] my eyes that I may see you fighting on my behalf in a dream.836 More pertinent to the Greco-Roman examples of curses and love charms, the angered or neglected hi is able to possess and destroy a human victim.837 Thus to ensure the hostility of the deceased recipient to the deposited victim, late Greek texts often specify that malevolent spells be placed in the tombs of those who died untimely or violent deaths, the 834. The basic study is Gardiner and Sethe 1928 (for the relation to the defixiones, see p. 10). Further examples appear in Gardiner 1930b; Simpson 1970; Goedicke overview is provided in Grieshammer 1975. For a PGM parallel, see PGM LI, 11. 1-27 (with my appended note), in Betz 1986, p. 283. The relationship between Greek, Coptic, and earlier Egyptian letters to the dead was denied by Drescher (1948, p. 275, n. 4) through a misreading of Gardiner and Sethe. 835. See Maxims 50-52 \"Wisdom of Ani,\" Suys 84-89 (Text with htp) and Volten 1937, p. 55: \"Pacify a spirit (,hi) by doing what he desires, being pure for him from his abominations that you might be safe from his many afflictions. His are all destructions. The head of cattle taken in the fields; it is he who has acted likewise. As for every loss in the threshing floor or in the field, one also says: 'The spirit ( ih)!'

Aopog or I3tautoOvatxo, who could be presumed to be jealous and vengeful.838 Although this practice cannot be confirmed for most dynastic deposits, it does accord nicely with the situation at Mirgissa, where the state rite is clearly accompanied by a corpse \"untimely and violently\" slain. Alternatively, the spirit may be summoned to act as an intermediary with the infernal tribunal for similar purposes, and thus the tomb becomes a receptacle for petitions to the underworld, styled \"the noble (mail)-box of Osiris\" (ti hieratic839 the \"(deposit)-box\" (itd3 t) in the Greek language texts.840 From this conception derive the numerous Demotic and Greek petitions for vengeance directed to deities and recovered from cemeteries.841 It is this format which appears in the \"love\" spell accompanying the Louvre assemblage (invoking the divinized Antinous), where it is combined with an appeal to the prematurely dead.842 The explicit requirement that late personal spells of execration 838.

The explanation for this preference is provided by the Egyptian priest Chaeremon (first century A.D.), as exerpted by Porphyry: \"... a bad and irrational soul which tried to depart the body after having been detached from it by violence yet stays near to it (because the souls of men who die by violence also keep themselves near to the body- a fact which should prevent one from committing suicide) ... Hence many souls are seen to lament and the souls of the unburied adhere to the bodies, souls which are abused by sorcerers for their own service, pressing them by retaining the body or part of it.\" For the passage, see van der Horst 1984, p. 37 (= Porphyry, De Abstentia 2.47). 839.

Less likely, the term could mean \"tablet\" in this context (so Preisendanz, see Liddell, Scott, and Jones 1940, p. 1554b), referring to a spell inscribed on wood rather than to the tomb where it was placed. 841. Demotic examples are published in Hughes 1958 (especially pp. 4-5 for the best discussion of the phe- nomenon); 1968; and 1969. Derivative Greek examples appear throughout the PGM (invoking Seth, Anubis, etc.); see also Pap. Oxyrhynchus XLI.2976 (petition to Thoueris), in Browne et al. 1972, p. 71. 842. The spell is directed to various underworld deities (Pluto, Persephone, Adonis, Hermes-Thoth, Anubis, \"the son of Ptah\"), but special prominence is given to the spirit of the dead Antinous. The identification of the vEKi6atov 'AvrivoE with Antinous the favorite of Hadrian was first recognized by du Bourguet (1975, p. 256), though he recanted this position in 1980 (p. 227) following the denial by Kambitsis (1976, p. 217, n. I). Kambitsis prefers to identify this Antinous with an otherwise unnamed, prematurely deceased Egyptian in whose tomb the assemblage was placed. The original identification is correct, however, since I) the placement in graves of letters to deities is an attested practice, exemplified by this spell with regard to Pluto et cetera, 2) the divine Antinous was associated with the underworld (as an aspect of Osiris) and was himself \"prematurely deceased\" so that he is in proper company with Pluto et al. and is particularly appropriate for these spells, 3) the prematurely dead are distinguished from the more exalted Antinous whom they are to assist, and most importantly 4) Antinous is invoked by name, unlike the invariable practice in the PGM where the deceased recipient is unnamed so that the spell might be generally applicable. It is just this general character which most clearly distinguishes these spells from the traditional \"letters to the dead.\"181 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE be buried in older tombs thus utilizes the traditional mechanism of \"letters to the dead\" to ensure the aid of the spirit as an agent or intermediary. The identical placement of earlier state execration rites in or beside extant private tombs must reflect the same intent. Indications that this is so appear already on the Old Kingdom execration deposits from Giza, which each bear the name of a private individual, determined by the \"seated noble\" hieroglyph A (Gardiner Sign-list A 50) usually reserved for the revered dead.843 Although these individuals have been considered \"dedicators\" of the deposit or agents associated with its delivery, 844 the determinative of their names suggests that they are deceased,845 and the \"name\" of one of them is otherwise unattested as a personal name, though it serves as the fundamental title of the blessed dead: t-iqr, \"Excellent Spirit.\"846 While no more verifiable than earlier speculation, the suspicion is nonetheless tempting that these individuals should be identified as the intended recipients of the jugs, deceased intermediaries between earth and the underworld.847 The similarity of technique between the \"letters to the dead\" and the state execration ritual extends also to the use of inscribed red bowls and vases.848 When used as \"letters,\" these bowls may once have held food offerings for the deceased recipients.849 The 843. The names, inscribed on the enclosing jars, are without title and preceded only by the date of the deposit. See Junker 1947, pp. 31-32: ltmi' (reread in Abu Bakr and Osing 1973, p. 133, n. 132); Abu Bakr Abu Bakr and Osing 1973, p. 133. 845. Acknowledged by Abu Bakr and Osing ibid., p. 133. 846. Wb 1: 16/3. See the comments of Osing 1976a, p. 155, and for the title and its significance, see Demar6e 1983. 847. In no case, however, were these deposits found in tombs of similarly named individuals, and the association of certain deposits with any specific tomb is unclear (Abu Bakr and Osing 1973, p. 127). Burial in the graveyard alone would have to serve as the method of contact (as in CT spell 37, discussed above). But see the comments in Junker 1947, pp. 31 and 38. If \"Excellent Spirit\" is only a title, any tomb would have sufficed for that deposit, paralleling the indiscriminate placement of deposits in the Demotic and Greek spells. 848. See the discussion in Gardiner and Sethe 1928, pp. 9-12 on the Qaw, Hu, Berlin, Cairo, Oxford, and Moscow bowls; and compare the use of bowls inscribed with protective spells in funerary contexts: BD spells Pleyte 167-69, in Allen 1974, p. 216. The use of bowls is a characteristic feature of the \"letters to the dead,\" and the custom may have spread, under Egyptian influence, to Crete, Palestine, and Mesopotamia, serving as the origin of the Aramaic and Mandaean \"incantation bowls\" (see C. H. Gordon 1969). For recent discussion of these incantation bowls, see Naveh and Shaked 1985, pp. 13ff. Like the Egyptian letters, the incantation bowls are often found in cemeteries (ibid., pp. 15-16), but they are usually found inverted. Their origin is suggested to be Mesopotamian in McCullough 1967, pp. xii-xv. 849. Gardiner and Sethe 1928, pp. 9-12.182 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES execration bowls can also be understood as proffering a gift to the deceased-the victim inscribed on the bowl, delivered over to \"the hand of a dead man or a dead woman.\"850 The fundamental unity of the two practices is demonstrated by a late love spell from Oxyrhynchus (third to fourth centuries).85' Inscribed on a pot, the Oxyrhynchus spell was buried in the necropolis, and invokes the resident spirit of the dead for its effect. In format and purpose, it is both a \"letter to the dead\" and a \"private execration rite\" directly comparable to the contemporary Louvre assemblage with its tortured figure. Taken together, the Louvre and Oxyrhynchus love spells display the same interchange of bowl and figurine already noted in the state rite of the Middle Kingdom. Designed as a prisoner, bound, pierced, enclosed, and entombed with the dead, the Louvre figurine may now be seen to derive its \"magical mechanics\" from a purely Egyptian milieu.852 Its constituent elements have been traced from Egyptian prehistory to the Christian era, appearing indiscriminately in royal, temple, and private contexts. The interdependence of these contexts is particularly striking given the long-standing attempt to isolate private ritual as \"magic.\" With regard to \"execration magic,\" however, any attempt to dissociate private from state and temple technique is clearly suspect. Nor can private rite be dismissed as \"derivative\" or \"debased.\" On the contrary, the apparent affiliation of the state rite to the private custom of \"letters to the dead\" necessarily raises the question of the degree of influence exerted by private custom on public ceremony and challenges the relevance of maintaining strict distinctions between private and public rites. PRIVATE VERSUS STATE MAGIC Indeed, the fundamental identity of private and state \"execration magic\" has already been tacitly recognized by commentators who have explained the significance of the latter by reference to the private Coffin Texts spell 37. The question of private use of the execration format is even more pertinent in the many finds of small sets of buried figurines inscribed not with the \"execration formula\" but with individual names.853 Best understood as the evidence of personal vendettas (and thus the direct ancestors of the Louvre 850. Perhaps derived from such offerings (or a parody of them) is the placement on a bowl of the severed skull at Mirgissa. 851. Wortmann 1968a, pp. 80--84 (text 3). 852. Contra du Bourguet 1980, p. 234. 853. For examples, see the overview in Posener 1975a and 1984, p. 615, n. 6. For the difficulty of distinguishing \"private\" figurines from \"public\" ones, see the comments on private oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE figurine), these smaller groupings are nonetheless equivalent in meaning and method to the more elaborate state production, differing only in scope. Traditional attempts to distinguish personal magic from state religion must of necessity be frustrated in such cases as these, where practice is identical and only the notion of \"private versus state\" remains as a distinguishing criterion. Even this criterion becomes unclear in the Egyptian section of the official ritual where private and state concerns may overlap,854 and it disappears entirely in the state ritual of the execration of Apophis, which enjoins the practitioner to destroy not only the image of Apophis and the enemies of pharaoh, but also one's own personal foes: This spell is said over Apep drawn on a new papyrus with fresh ink and placed within a coffin ... Then inscribe for yourself these names of all male and female enemies whom your heart fears as every enemy of pharaoh whether dead or alive, the name of their fathers, the name of their mothers, the name of (their) children; (to be placed) within a coffin, to be made (also) in wax, to be placed on the fire after the name of Apep.855 This unity of public and private practice may have been present in the earliest execration rites if the personal names on the jars of the Pepi II deposits are to be understood as the donors of the ritual. Though performed primarily on behalf of the monarch, the execration could easily have included personal enemies of the donors among the intermingled Egyptians and foreigners-exactly as is stipulated by the later \"Apophis Book.\"856 Potential trespassers against the funerary estate of Amenhotep son of Hapu are threatened with just such a fate, with their names being added to the list of the condemned in the rite against Apep: \"They are for the knife on the day of destruction; Let them be termed Nkiw (\"The Vanquished One,\" a name of Apep).\"857 854.

The basic compatibility of temple and private ritual is underscored by the use of the Bremner-Rhind papyrus itself. Though intended for a temple library, the papyrus ultimately served as a private funerary text. For this and similar adaptations, see Schott 1956, pp. 181ff. 856.

As for wax, one makes execration figures ( ) with it to destroy his name.865 858. A version of this discussion of terminology now appears in Ritner 1989a. 859. So Wb 5: 408/12-15 and 409/1-2. 860.

Thus, on the thirteenth col- umn of the Edfu forecourt, the ceremony of \"Putting the '1 on the flame\" is illustrated with a vignette which shows the king holding small prisoners by a tether over a brazier before Osiris.868 On the east wall of the temple library, the chief lector priest (hry-hb lry- tp) is depicted in the act of skewering nine figurines on a lance before the king. The title of the ritual reads \"Overthrowing the enemies of the king daily as (and) as the Nine Bows.\"869 The most common use of these words, however, is in standardized epithets and addresses in which enemies are said to be gathered together, burned, or trampled beneath the feet of the god or king m *ts.t or m *ntstyv.870 In each of these instances, the statement alludes directly to known cultic practice with prisoner figurines, and the crucial passage would best be translated \"as execration figures,\" and not simply \"in hordes.\" Thus the promise of Hathor to present to the king those who rebel against him \"as execration 866.

No certain phonetic spellings of *ts.t are known,873 and the logogram (1, var. ) used to write the word is ambiguous, often serving for , with the reading rs.874 Moreover, a comparable word rs.t is known, spelled with the latter logogram and in a context identical to that of the supposed *ts.t of the late religious texts. In the Amada Stela of Amenophis II, the king is said to have \"made -as his enemies, (and) the Nine Bows likewise.\"875 The parallelism is obvious between this phrase and the Edfu ritual of \"Overthrowing the enemies of the king daily as execration figures (and) as the Nine Bows.\" In both cases, the term for \"enemy figure\" should be identical and thus read rs.t. Further, the unmistakable ritual context of the Edfu example strongly favors a similar ceremonial interpretation for the Amada parallel. Both should reflect the standard \"smiting scene\" depicted on temple 871. Chassinat 1932, p. 157/11 (within a rite of sm? '?pp).

Louvre C 14) who boasts of his ability to depict such \"smiting scenes,\" knowing \"how to make frightened the face of the I~ii .\"877 The phonetic spelling of rs.t suggests a literal translation \"those who are guarded\";878 the late variant with initial n would signify \"One/Those belonging to\" that group.879 If correctly analyzed, the designation rs.t may have been applied primarily to those foreign princes and individuals placed on the execration lists, and only secondarily to the figurines themselves. Such an interpretation accords better with other occurrences of the term where the translation \"figurines\" seems excluded, but affiliation to the execration ritual is not.880 Despite the uncertainty regarding 876. The slain enemies of the Narmer palette were presumably replaced by figurines in later enactments, such as that depicted at Medinet Habu. For these \"smiting scenes,\" see above, pp. 115-16. For the substitution of figurines for human victims, see Yoyotte 1980-81. Such substitutions are paralleled within the funerary cult, in which subsidiary burials of slain retainers are replaced by statues, models, and ultimately by ushebtis. The hostile character of the original rite was not forgotten, however, and reappears in the Book of the Dead where ushebtis are likened to prisoners in compulsory service; see Pleyte 166, \u00a74, in Allen 1974, p. 216: \"(But for) Osiris N., all of these were his slaves while he was on earth.

The phrase \"Nubian rs.t\" could indicate all those Nubian territories and kingdoms known to the Egyptians in the execration lists. A similar implication can be argued for the term in the speech of the god Dedun to Tuthmosis III the lands of the rs.t ({A ) and terror of you in the bodies of those who had been ignorant (of it).\" The creation of such fear was, of course, the specific goal of the execration rite. An example from the Late Period appears in Goyon 1972, p. 123, \u00a7345 (col. 20/9): hsfk? rs., translated will say 'Destroy?'\" Goyon considered the alphabetic spelling to be an error, styling the term a \"mot embarrassant\" (p. 123). See also the name of a netherworld demon H sfrs.t, \"He who destroys the rs.t ( '.I ~ ),\" in Faulkner 1958, pp. 24, 38 (n. to 35/2), and 55* (col. 35/2). Faulkner, (p.188 oi.uchicago.eduIMAGES AND INTERMEDIARIES the root meaning of the term, there can be little doubt that it ultimately came to signify \"execration figures\" in royal, temple, and private ritual. The most convincing proof of this assertion is provided by a group of unrecognized figurines from a private collection in London. Depicting a man, woman, and child, three crude clay images are best interpreted as the artifacts of a ritual of execration directed against a family. Inscribed in black ink below the clasped hands of the female figurine is the identifying label 6, rs.t (see fig. 17).881 As neither terminology nor technique separate public from private ritual sorcery, so a comparison of the potential efficacy of the two practices yields no discernible distinction. Contrary to modern preconceptions of magic as impotent fraud, the question of magical effectiveness is a genuine issue within societies which accept (and fear) the possibility of its success. Within such societies, hostile sorcery or \"witchcraft\" is often highly successful, resulting in a lethal wasting sickness (dubbed \"voodoo death\" by anthropologists).882 Within Egypt, private no less than public rites were believed to manipulate the genuine 38, n. to col. 35/2) further suggests that rs.t should be read in a damaged passage in the Ikhernofret stela describing the ritual combat enacted for Osiris (S. Berlin 1204, 18): \"I repelled the I from the nm.t-bark; I felled the foes of Osiris.\" If correct, this example could easily signify \"execration figures\" slain in a mock battle. The passage has elsewhere been read hirwy.w, or sb/.w, ' , \"enemies\"; for the text and translations, see Lichtheim 1973, pp. 123-25, adding Volten 1942, p. 21, n.

For the images, see Munro 1972 and the analysis in Ritner 1989a. The statuettes had been attributed to the Predynastic Period on the basis of the crudity of the work (Munro 1972, p. 28, notes that the faces resemble hamsters more than humans), but execration figures of all periods are invariably crude, and workmanship cannot be used to determine date. Thus Posener (1958, p. 255) speaks of this shoddy workmanship as \"une vieille tradition, car les figurines d'envoItement sont presque toujours mal faconnees.\" Ironically, these unidentified figures were published together with an obvious prisoner figurine of a bound female (Kestner Museum 1926.200, also crudely modeled and thus misidentified as a foreign product), a prototype of the Roman period Louvre figurine. Like the two parallels cited from the British Museum (Munro 1972, p. 29, BM 56914 and 56928), this female figurine is identical in meaning (if not in modeling) to the \"hamster-faced\" images; it does not represent \"ein ganz anderes Motiv\" (contra Munro 1972, p. 28).

Setna I, col. 4/3 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE THE HARIM CONSPIRACY The solution to the question of the difference between royal and private execration ritual is perhaps best illustrated by the single certain instance in which the use of magic by king and commoner was anciently felt to be in direct conflict-the \"Harim Conspiracy\" during the turbulent reign of Ramses III (ca. 1182-1151 B.C.).885 With the compliance of stewards, inspectors, and certain women of the harim, and with the aid of a general, a troop commander in Nubia, a priest, a magician, and other functionaries, a certain queen Tiye plotted unsuccessfully to murder the reigning monarch and place her son Pentawere upon the throne. The partially preserved trial records of their failed attempt document the indictment of twenty-eight men and an undetermined number of women, and the execution or enforced suicide of all but five (four of whom were mutilated by the loss of nose and ears). They also constitute the only evidence of a trial or accusation for sorcery known from ancient Egypt. Having failed to designate either a \"Great Royal Wife\" or a crown prince, Pharaoh Ramses himself had provided the necessary preconditions for the conspiracy.886 Interestingly, these prerequisites appear to correspond closely to those anticipated by the current anthropological model for witchcraft accusations, in which the determining factors are social instability and the absence of defined channels of power.887 The pertinent sections of the conspiracy records are as follows: 885. The primary sources are Papyri Lee, Rollin, Rifaud, and the Turin \"Judicial Papyrus.\" The precise date of the plot within the reign of Ramses III is unknown. For editions and discussion, see pp. 360-66; and Koenig 1989. Compare also nn. 46 and 250, above. 886. See the remarks of Weber 1977, col. 989 and Gardiner 1961, p. 291. 887. See Douglas 1970, p. xxxv: \"Where social interaction is intense and ill defined, there we may expect to find witchcraft beliefs\"; and Brown 1970, p. 21: \"Late Roman society was dominated by the problem of the conflict between change and stability in a traditional society. It is here that we find a situation which has been observed both to foster sorcery accusations and to offer scope for resort to sorcery.\" The Egypt of Ramses III represented a similar traditional society in transformation. Beset by foreign invasion, political instability, and work strikes at home, and the loss of colonial possessions abroad, the Twentieth Dynasty marks the end of the New Kingdom and the cultural self-satisfaction that had characterized it. Unlike later European (or American) \"witchcraft\" accusations, however, there seems little reason to doubt the reality of the crime or the veracity of the court proceedings. The techniques of hostile magic involved were commonplace, and the accused were precisely the individuals with access to, and familiarity with, the necessary rituals.192 oi.uchicago.eduPRIESTS AND PRACTITIONERS PAPYRUS ROLLIN [...] He began888 to make writings of magic (hkw)889 for exorcising890 (and) for disturbing, (and he began)891 to make some gods of wax892 (and) some potions 888.

Contra Goedicke 1963, p. 73, the phrase ir ss.w, \"to make writings,\" is not the least ambiguous, nor is it \"unlikely that the culprit was accused of composing magic writings,\" since \"magic\" (hk?) is specifically mentioned. Utterly groundless is Goedicke's perverse attempt to debase the meaning of hk? to \"that non-supernatural sense in which 'bewitch' is used in modern times, with the implication of causing confusion.\" His uneasiness (pp. 74-75) over the conspirators' use of magic in a situation \"too risky\" for the \"uncertain outcome\" of sorcery betrays a modern Western perspective quite alien to ancient Egypt. There is no reason to doubt that the conspirators---or their victims-felt \"a high degree of confidence in the efficacy of Egyptian magic\" (p. 75). 890.

Baer) compare rk in the Harsiyotef stela, Il. 103 and (translated \"defeat\"). Although Goedicke (1963, p. 74) recognizes that the term stwh? is \"peculiar to magic literature,\" his bias requires that it \"undoubtedly does not refer to an 'act of magic' although the figure of speech might seem to imply it.\" His translation of stwhl as \"to cause unintentional inactivity\" has little to recommend it. 891.

For Demotic parallels, see Griffith 1909a and 1909b. 895. The terminology falsifies the actual state of affairs, and is equally an act of damnatio memoriae, intended to deprive the victim of any underworldly benefits accruing from his earthly status; see Vernus 1974; Koenig 1989, pp. 53-54 (11. 1 and 6); and compare the execration practice noted in Posener 1977, p. 511 and above, n. 632. 896.

Goedicke (1963, p. 81), read the signs as *rnw, r ,\" which he translated with the preceding s.'i i as \"(piece) of writing of the (royal) names,\" i.e., \"royal letter-head paper\"! Goedicke's fanciful translation derives from a thoroughly misguided attempt to deny the role of magic in the conspiracy and may be readily disregarded; see above, n. 889. An unam- biguous use of *r- -s. as \"(magic) scroll\" appears in the Harris Magical Pap., col. 11/2 (= spell Y, 5) in Lange 1927, pp. 92, 94, and 96: \"1 am entrusted with the good scroll ( ) which Re_ I e I r placed in my hand, which averts (siwh ;) lions and stops (r k,) men, which averts (stwli >) men and stops (r\"k :) lions.\" The identical context of the term in the Harris and the Lee papyri is striking; in both papyri the word describes magical texts designed to \"avert\" or \"exorcise\" (swh ). A further example may be forthcoming from a notation on Pap. Geneva MAH 15274 vo., col. 4/2, if the refer- ence to *r >-'-sc indicates the papyrus collection of anti-poison spells on which the docket itself is copied (Massart 1957, p. 183 and pl. 38; Kitchen 1983b, p. 144/12). Massart (1957, p. 183) translates simply \"writing materials.\" That the term can be used simply for \"documents\" is clear from Pap. Ambras, I. 9, which summarizes the \"total of the papyrus rolls which were in the jar, nine docu- ments (7t 19 )\"; see Peet 1930. p. 181 and p1. 38. Further examples are gathered in Eyre 1984, p. 198, n. h. For this disputed group, Posener (1976a, p. 436) adopted the reading *r? '(with writing and wood determinatives), which he translated as \"chests\" or \"coffers (for papyrus)\" without further proof. Posener's unstated evidence is easily reconstructed from examples formerly understood as \"writing materials.\" Thus, in the Rarnesside \"Journals\" of the Theban necropolis, year 3, col. 4/3-4, a , \" \" is mentioned in conjunction with two \"chests\" ( fdv): \"We gave two chests to the two fanbearers and one *r?- ('?)\" (translated by the editors as equipment[?J\"); see and Peet196 oi.uchicago.eduPRIESTS AND PRACTITIONERS side(?)906 of the harim and this other great deep place.907 And he began to make inscribed people of wax908 in order to cause that they be taken inside by the hand of the agent I(d)rimi for the exorcising (stwh?)909 of the one crew and the enchanting910 (hk'w) of the others, to take a few words911 inside and to bring the others out. Now when he was reading and interpretation may be proposed for this critical term. An alternate reading *r,'-(-ht, S I I I , \"(written) weaponry\" (cf. Wb 2: 394/12-395/1) is also possible and would fit the threatening nature of the documents; cf. the hieroglyphic example of a book title from the temple library at Edfu in Chassinat 1928, p. 351 (= Porter and Moss 1939, p. 135, \u00a797) and H. Brugsch 1871, p. 44: , \"the (ritual) weaponry,\" (translated by Brugsch: \"das Buch von den Schriften allen zum Arbeiten\").

This central feature of Goedicke's historical reconstruction is, however, untenable. A p/i-ntr need have no relation with Amon even in Thebes, is not restricted to major festi- vals but could be done privately, and is not the \"Arrival (of the) God\" but rather \"arriving (to the) God.\" 905.

The notion of horizontal depth implicit in the term md.t is here strengthened by the use of the verb p/h, \"to penetrate.\" Goedicke's translation \"high,\" (1963, pp. 78 and 85) is unacceptable and his attempted identification of the site with the high gate of Medinet Habu is thus excluded. Similarly, in the Demotic Pap. London and Leiden, col. 29/6-7, the term is used to indicate depth in contrast to width (wsh.t): \"Open to me the heaven in its width and depth\"; contra Griffith and Thompson (1904, p. 167) who translate: \"in its breadth and height.\" 908.

Court records state unambiguously that the unknown defendant of Papyrus Lee, column 1, had provided the criminal Pn-hwy-bin with a royal text, despite his oath to the contrary.915 It is thus absolutely excluded that the \"great crimes worthy of death, the great abomina- tions of the land\" are to be equated with the practice of sorcery per se, since both the 912.

Such a restoration, however, does not yield a complete sentence, and the text clearly ends at this point.

This combination of written spell, manipulated figures, and magic by ingredient conforms directly to the tripartite nature of magic as previously analyzed. 915.

Whether this was accomplished by magic or by physical force was irrelevant; assassination by sword would hardly have been more acceptable. Comparable to a sword, magic was a weapon for the Egyptians,917 and the legality of its usage was dependent upon the identity of the intended victim. The records of the Harim Conspiracy thus reveal a condemnation of sorcery against the king, not a condemnation of sorcery itself. The truth of this statement is evident from a comparable use of execration technique in seemingly identical circumstances not by the consnirators, but by agents of the king. Evidence for this harim conspiracy is forthcoming from the \"Instructions of Amenemhat I,\" ostensibly dictated by the ghost of that assassinated monarch to his son and co-regent, Sesostris I. In the course of the Instruction, Amenemhat describes those who plotted his murder: It was he who ate my bread who raised troops. He to whom I had given my hands created terror by means of it. He who was dressed in my linen viewed me as fodder. He who was anointed with my myrrh spat before me ... Had women ever previously marshaled troops? Are rebels bred within the palace?918 The identity of one conspirator may be provided by a series of five alabaster execration plaques now in the Cairo Museum.919 Said to derive from Helwan, the plaques were part of an assemblage which included a broken prisoner figurine of clay covered with a long (and now illegible) inscription. In addition, the find contained six sheets of wax which had been inscribed before being folded or rolled to form a torso to which wax arms and legs were added. The resulting six wax figures had the appearance of captives, and are the obvious counterparts to the \"men of wax\" used in the conspiracy against Ramses III. As these figures have not been unrolled, their texts, like that of the illegible clay figure, remain unknown. The five alabaster plaques, however, bear a variant of the standard \"execration 916.

The first of these is \"the deceased Intefiker,\" whose parents are Intefiker and Satsisobek.920 The elder Intefiker can be identified,921 and was none other than the vizier of the murdered Amenemhat I. That the vizier and his family fell from grace is clear not only from these texts, where all of their names are determined by the hieroglyph for \"enemy,\"922 but also by the willful destruction anciently inflicted upon images of the vizier in the Theban tomb belonging to his family.923 The reason for the suppression of Intefiker is unknown, as is its date. Until recently, it had been assumed that the career of the vizier spanned at least from the tenth year of Amenemhat I (attested by graffiti from Korosko in Nubia) to the seventeenth year of Sesostris I (suggested by Papyrus Reisner II, dated to year 17 of an unnamed king), a period of more than thirty years.924 However, recent analysis suggests that the evidence linking \"year 17\" to Sesostris I is unsupported, and that the date could refer instead to the reign of Amenemhat 1.925 Thus there is no longer any proof that Intefiker's career survived the transition of reigns,926 and, consequently, there is every reason to suspect that the damnatio memoriae inflicted on himself and his son was connected with the purge of officials implicated in the successful assassination of Amenemhat. The connivance of the 920. The second name is Senwosret, son of lams(?); no designation for \"deceased\" precedes this name; Posener 1987, pp. 55-56. 921. The name Satsisobek is otherwise attested only in TT 60, where the name belongs to the wife of the vizier Intefiker. For the identification of the family, see Posener 1976a, p. 441 and the brief remarks in 1987, p. 55. 922. Posener 1976a, p. 442 and 1987, p. 55 and pls. 4-5. 923. For the destruction of TT 60 (of Senet, mother? of Intefiker the vizier), see Davies, Gardiner, and Davies 1925a, pp. 5 (deliberate burning) and 6-7 (erasure of Intefiker throughout). Contra Gardiner (p. 5), the presence of graffiti from the Eighteenth Dynasty praising the tomb decoration need not imply that the burning took place later than that period. Ancient antiquarians may have been attracted to ruins no less than their modern counterparts; compare the activities of Khaemwese, discussed in Gomah 1973. Posener (1976a, p. 441) is suspicious of linking the erasures of Intefiker the vizier with the mention of his son on the execration plaques. However, both father and son are defamed on the plaques (p. 442), and both could have been involved in the harim conspiracy. 924. Posener 1976a, pp. 441-42. 925. See the discussion in Simpson 1969, pp. 10-1 1. 926. The appearance of an erased Intefiker before Sesostris I in TT 60 (Davies, Gardiner, and Davies 1925a, p. 13) need not prove that the vizier functioned during the independent reign of that monarch. Of course, the discovery of the vizier's complicity-if such were the case-might not have been made immediately, and he could have continued to act as vizier for an unknown length of time.200 oi.uchicago.eduPRIESTS AND PRACTITIONERS vizier in such a plot was probably not without precedent; Amenemhat I had himself been the vizier of the preceding king Nebtawyre Montuhotep, whose fate is unknown.927 Yet another example of a harim conspiracy combated by execration rites appears to be represented by the famous Berlin red pots, the first discovered exemplars of the genre. Now dated to the reign of Sesostris III or later, the Berlin texts are notable for the presence in the Egyptian section of \"names characteristic of the 12th dynasty royal family\" and \"functionaries of women who seem to be princesses or queens.\"928 Despite the absence of definite corroborating evidence, the ritual cursing of these deceased(?)929 royal ladies and their retainers almost certainly derives from the suppression of a conspiracy originating in the harim, and the texts have been suggested by van Seters to illustrate the discordant his- torical context decried in the literary \"Admonitions of Ipuwer.\"930 Although the correlation is far from certain, one passage from the \"Admonitions\" is of particular pertinence for the discussion of the \"Harim Conspiracy\" and the \"private\" use of execration ritual: 927. See the remarks of Gardiner 1961, p. 125 and Posener 1956, p. 51. A peaceful transition is suggested in von Beckerath 1965. 928. Wilson 1969c, p. 329, n. 15. 929. See above, pp. 141-42, especially n. 627. Following the original edition of Sethe, Wilson (1969c, p. 329) translates \"May NN die.\" Whereas the interpretation of Sethe and Wilson construes the texts as the work of the conspirators (designed to effect a coup), the retranslation \"deceased\" suggests instead that they are the product of royal agents (as does the presence of the African, Asiatic, and Libyan sections) dictated after the failure of a plot. The very fact that such confusion of authorship is possible underscores the fundamental unity of method utilized by conspirator and king alike. 930. Van Seters 1964, p. 22 and 1966, p. 120. Van Seters notes the similar fear of Asiatics, Nubians, and Libyans in the \"Execration Texts\" and the \"Admonitions,\" and for the hypothetical harim conspiracy he compares such passages as \"Admonitions,\" col. 7/2-4: \"A few lawless men have ventured to despoil the land of kingship. Men have ventured to rebel against the uraeus ...\" Although the texts display similar anxieties, these lists of potential enemies are standard at all periods of Egyptian history, and it is hazardous to assume a specific relation. The attempt to link both the \"Execration Texts\" and the \"Admonitions\" to the Second Intermediate Period is unconvincing, as much of van Seters' argument depends upon the now-discredited theory of a peaceful absorption of Egypt by the Hyksos.201 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE Indeed, magical spells (!ik?.w) are divulged; oracles (sm.w)931 and spells of seeking(?) (shn.w)932 are made dangerous (snhr) because they are remembered by men.933 The rare term snh _, 3 , here translated \"made dangerous,\" means literally \"to make rough.\"934 As recognized by Gardiner, the editor of the \"Admonitions,\" the word in this passage is susceptible to two quite opposite interpretations, signifying either that-by repetition-spells were made \"threatening\" (through uncontrolled usage) or \"frustrated\" (diminished in efficacy by overuse).935 After reflection, Gardiner opted for the latter interpretation. There is, however, no evidence that the power of hk, (or the force of oracles) can be lessened by repeated usage, and the retention of traditional spells (whose antiquity was felt to enhance, not exhaust their efficacy) argues convincingly against such a possibility.936 Nor can the mere \"recalling of magic\" be inimical in itself, as is proved by the existence of spells \"to remember magic\" (sh >.t ik>w).937 Rather, the dissemination of h!k could become a threat to the realm of Pharaoh as it had to that of the sun god Re in primordial time: Moreover, guard against those magicians who know their spells, since the god Heka is in them himself. Now as for the one who ingests him, I (scil. Re) am there. 931.

The range of meanings for shn is later extended to include the concepts \"chance\" and \"(astrological) conjunctions\" (Erichsen 1954a, p. 455), though these meanings are unlikely here. 933. \"Admonitions,\" col. 6/6-7, in Gardiner 1969, pp. 47-48. of nh.', \"rough/roughness,\" (Wb 2: 290-91: \"wild/terrible\") used of eyes (Wb 2: 290/19), dry stone (Wb 2: 291/1), raw copper (Wb 2: 291/2), etc.; for the term, see Lloyd 1975, pp. 59-66 and Hornung 1963, vol. 2, p. 133. 935.

It was only when magic was used for illegal purposes, as in the case described by the Lee-Rollin papyri, that it became punishable; in such instances it was the end, not the means, that incurred the penalties of the law. 947 Using identical methods-and identical texts-royal and private magic are here distinguished exclusively by self interest. Even this distinction grows evanescent once it is realized that the \"categories\" themselves are only illusory, for there are no truly \"royal\" or \"private\" magical spells in ancient Egypt, only priestly spells used for royal or private benefit. Of necessity, the ability to compose, copy, or recite such spells was limited to the king, the priests, and the scribes who alone comprised the approximately one percent of the population able to read or write.948 Neither king nor commoner freely composed written spells or rites; the former did not949 and the latter could not. Rather, as exemplified by the warnings for secrecy quoted above, the composition and preservation of magical incantations (as well as hymns, rituals, and even medical potions) was the prerogative of the \"House of Life,\" -C- (pr- 'nh), 946. Contrast the praise given ancient authors in Pap. Chester Beatty 4, vo. 3/9-10, in Gardiner 1935, vol. 1, p. 39: \"They hid their magic from the masses. It is read in their Instructions,\" with the punishment accorded to Setna, who \"had no occupation on earth but to unroll the book (of Thoth) and read from it to everyone\" (col. 4/38 in Lichtheim 1980, p. 133). 947. Gardiner 1969, p. 47. 948. See Baines and Eyre 1983; Baines 1983; and te Velde 1986. For literacy as a fundamental requirement for priesthood in the Late Period, see Sauneron 1962a and Fairman 1958, p. 87, n. d. Sacerdotal authorship of magical texts continues unabated throughout later Egyptian history, contra Sadek 1971, who unjustifiably characterizes later magical papyri as \"most often the work of not very literate commoners\" (p. 113); for full discussion, see Ritner 1995. 949. For the non-scribal role of the literate king, see Baines and Eyre 1983, pp. 77-81. The priests concemrned with magical spells on behalf of the king (si md4.t ntr n nb t?.wy, \"scribe of the divine book of the Lord of the Two Lands\") are discussed in Wessetzky 1984a. The non-royal composition of even such \"royal\" texts as the Pyramid Texts is evident from obvious insertions, cf. PT spell 467: \"I have not opposed the king,\" in Faulkner 1969, p. 156 and n. 6 (\"I\" explained as \"the successor to the throne?\"). A similar transition from the private to the royal sphere is suggested for the anti-serpent spell in AltenmUller 1979, attested in papyri, on private statuary, and on the curative statue of Ramses III at Almazah (spell VI); see Drioton 1939 and 1957. In all cases, however, the spell was surely a scriptorium product, and the Almazah statue represents a royal benefaction for public benefit. Any transition is simply a question of patronage (the hazy distinction between temple and king); neither authors nor audience has changed.204 oi.uchicago.eduPRIESTS AND PRACTITIONERS the sacred scriptorium attached to temples throughout the country.950 Thus, there need be little surprise that \"spells\" and \"hymns\" so often overlap,951 since they were composed by the same sacerdotal group and derive from the same theology. A similar rationale should be held to account for the apparent relationship previously noted between the \"private\" execration ritual of Coffin Texts spell 37 and the \"royal\" execration (and Amduat) texts (above, pp. 168-70 and 173-74). Identical in practice and purpose, such spells share priestly authorship as well, differing only in application. In fact, the general limitation on literacy severely circumscribes the whole notion of \"private magic\" in ancient Egypt. Leaving funerary compositions aside, the \"private\" ownership of magical books was 950. The basic study remains Gardiner 1938: \"It is in the -''- that medical and religious books were written and it was there that all questions relating to such learned matters were settled\" (p. 159); \"... magical spells intended for the use of the living came within the scope of the House of Life\" (p. 164); \"No doubt the Books of the Dead ... were characteristic products of the House of Life\" (p. 178).

For the magical holdings of such libraries (pr-md?.t) attached to temples, compare the Edfu list published in Chassinat 1928, p. 351 (= Porter and Moss 1939, p. 135, \u00a797), translated in H. Brugsch 1871, pp. 1965, pp. 58-61. For the suggested existence of collections of spells against scorpion sting at the temple of Hor-Khenty-Khety at Athribis, see Jelinkovi-Reymond 1956, pp. 132-33, especially Siculus 1933, vol. 1, pp. 172- 73 (1.49.3) records that the temple library of the Ramesseum was designated i lruf iottpeiov, \"Healing Place of the Soul.\" The Egyptian temple origin of the Demotic spells and most-if not all- of the PGM collections is discussed at length in Ritner 1995. The bulk of the Demotic and PGM \"grimoires\" probably derives from a single Theban temple archive acquired by Anastasi in the early nineteenth century (subsequently dispersed through auctions of his collection). 953. Aside from the Ramesseum magician's collection (see below, pp. 222ff.), the evidence for such \"borrowings\" all dates from the Late Period. This proprietary attitude toward temple property is indicative of the late, hereditary priesthood which regularly derived its income and status from the exploitation of temple assets. For the phenomenon, compare J. H. Johnson 1986b. Among the magical temple papyri appropriated for \"private\" use by priests are the \"Apophis Book\" (Pap. Bremner-Rhind) copied by the god's father and prophet Nesmin (who adapted as well the liturgical \"glorifications\" of Pap. BM 10208 and 10209); the Osirian rituals of Pap. MMA L 23.79.3 modified for the priest Imhotep; the rituals against Seth (Schott 1929) which include Pap. Louvre E 3129 belonging to the god's father Pasherenmin; Pap. BM 10252 adapted for Pawerem; and the prophylactic Pap. BM 10288 also modified for redactors are certainly responsible for the \"private\" adaptation of the originally royal protective rites published in Sauneron 1970a. Access to royal ritual papyri would have been impossible for \"commoners with little refined knowledge of the current cults and a frequently confused sense of mythology\"; contra Sadek 1971, p. 114. A temple origin is certain for the Metternich stela (copied by the god's father Nestem \"after he had found it removed from the domain of Osiris Mnevis\"), and other \"healing statues\"; see pp. 4-6 (for dedicator as chief of the temple of Hor-Khenty-Khety at Athribis) and 132-33 (for texts copied from temple rolls, the bL.w R '). For such adaptations, see also n. 855, above. For the question of the \"private\" magical practitioner, see below, pp. 211-12 and 220ff. 954. Thus the \"Dream Book\" and other magical rolls from the Chester Beatty collection were the property of the scribes Amennakhte and Keniherkhepeshef, and the latter copied (though he did not compose) spells against demons and ghosts. It is notable, however, that Pap. Chester Beatty 8 is said to have been a temple text: \"This writing was found in the library, (in a) room of the temple\" (col. 4/3); see Gardiner 1935, vol. 1, p. 68 and compare vol. 1, p. 74 (vo. 7/7): \"to be recited by the chief lector priest.\" For the ownership of magical texts at Deir el-Medineh, see Gardiner ibid., vol. 1, pp. 8 and 26; fern 1973, pp. 334-36; and Pestman 1982. For the copies of Keniherkhepeshef, see Edwards 1968 and Koenig 1981. The attribution of these copies is made certain by distinctive paleography; other preserved charms from Deir el-Medineh may be the work of specialized \"magicians\" within the community, and need not have been copied by their intended beneficiary-for example, Pap. Deir el- Medineh 36, published by Sauneron (1970b). Clear evidence of the circulation of magical papyri among the scribes of Deir el-Medineh is afforded by the dockets on the verso of Pap.

Nevertheless, such influence in no way minimizes the central role of the priest as redactor of the execration rite in all its various manifestations, which include not only those intended for \"private\" or \"royal\" benefit, but numerous temple execration rites957 which entail the destruction of figures for the benefit of the gods and the cosmos: 15274, which record the \"giving of spells for vo. 2/1-6, vo. ;-'-si), in Massart 182-83 and pl. 38 and Kitchen 1983b, pp. 133-34 and 144. The transferred spell may be the anti-scorpion remedy copied in vo. 5; Massart 1957, pp. 183-84 and pl. 37. 955. For the priestly role of the workmen, see Bierbrier 1982, p. 96: \" With such a multiplicity of divinities and temples, the community might be thought to have required a large number of priests to serve its needs. This was not, however, the case. The workmen themselves acted as their own priests and performed all the sacred rituals for their gods.\" So also Valbelle (1985, pp. 328-31), who notes the mingling of religious acts at the site: \"En effet, la distinction parait souvent 956. Compare the examples of \"fording spells\" from tombs of the Old Kingdom, in the \"Story of the Herdsman,\" in PT spell 240, in CT spell 836, and in the Harris Magical Papyrus. Though these have often been described as \"common knowledge\" (thus Goedicke 1970, p. 252), it is notable that the example in the \"Story of the Herdsman\" is said to be recited (sd) by the knowledgeable ones (rt.w-It.t, literally, \"knowers of things\") of the herdsmen\" (11. 12-13). For this term meaning \"magician,\" see below, pp. 229-31. This nuance of specialized knowledge even for spells of daily life appears also in the Harris Magical Pap., which specifies the \"water spell\" as \"a veritable secret of the House of Life,\" whose completed amulet alone may be entrusted simply to \"a man at the prow of the boat,\" see n. 945, above. The theological complexity of these spells in Old Kingdom tombs has been investigated by Kaplony (1969 and 1970) and Altenmiller (1973). For further bibliography, see above, p. 48, n. 229, adding Borghouts 1978, p. 83 (no. 122); Ogdon 1982 and 1979; G.

Common spells against scorpion and snake bite were certainly priestly creations, carved on cippi of Horus and on \"healing statues\" dedicated by priests or the king. Individuals neither read nor memorized these spells, but instead drank a water offering poured over the carved surface. See inter alia Lacau 1921-22; Drioton 1939; and Traunecker 1983. Spells for childhood illnesses are similarly specialized knowledge; where the practitioner is indicated, he is a hry-hb, or \"lector-priest,\" whose magical function is discussed below, pp. 220ff. See Erman 1901, pp. 25-26 (Pap. Berlin P. 3027, col. 6/5, broken, but certain). There is no proof for Erman's suggestion (p. 4) that the spells were recited by mothers in the harim; compare the tkly n kip, U, \"magician of the nursery,\" noted in Gardiner 1917, p. 32. 957.

The same procedure (pp. 37/3-59/16) is performed on a figure of a bound captive, who may be assimilated to one's personal enemy (p. 61/17-18). Reference to the text appears in the Edfu book list, see H. Brugsch 1871, p. 44 and above, n. 903. A further reference to this rite may be preserved in Plut .rch, De Iside et Osiride, 30.362 F (see Griffiths 1970, pp. 164-65 and 411-12), which speaks of sacrificial cakes with the image of an ass tied by rope. 961. Figurines of enemies are placed on a brazier, see Goyon 1978a. For the text, see Chassinat 1930, p. 293 = idem 1960, pl. 134. This execration rite derives from what may have been in the Middle Kingdom a mock battle within a liturgical enactment of the Osiris myth; compare the statements of the priest Ikhernofret: \"I repulsed the attackers of the neslhmet-bark, I felled the foes of Osiris,\" in Sethe 1983, p. 70 (11. 12-13 and cf. 17-18), translated with bibliography in Lichtheim 1973, pp. 123-25.

E.g., the rituals depicted on the interior walls of the temple library. On the east wall, a lector priest pierces nine prisoner figures (the \"Nine Bows\") on a lance: see Chassinat 1928, p. 349 and pl. 82 and Capart 1940, p. 7. On the west wall, four enemy figures are successively stabbed while being burnt before Horus; see Chassinat 1928, pp. 346-47 and 59-60 (misidentified as Chassinat 1929b, pl. 82). With the latter rite, compare the burning of four enemy figures slain with a flint knife before Horus and Hathor in Chassinat 1930, pp. 142-45 and 1960, pl. 118. 964.

The fundamental unity of this rite with the \"breaking of the red pots\" and other execration rites is discussed in Alliot 1946, pp. 106ff. Compare also the ritual protection of the bark of Osiris, in which a wax figure of Seth is similarly caught in a net, above, n. 964. Reference to the text appears in the Edfu book list, see HI.

Within a liturgical context, the passage suggests an enactment like that of lkhernofret (n. 961, above). See also the scriptorium rite of Pap. Salt 825, above, pp. 175-76. 969. The complete ritual (termed tHw'i rm.w, \"striking fish\") is given at Esna. At each of the four directional gates of the temple, priests smite a fish which has a name of a demonic enemy of the king and cosmos (Apep, \"Evil of Character,\" Baba) written with fresh ink on a new papyrus sheet affixed to its mouth with wax. The fish, now become these enemies, are thrown into a fire of fenugreek and bryony as the \"Book of Overthrowing Apep\" is read. The charred remains are cast into a canal by the priests of Sakhmet. See Sauneron 1962b, pp. 24-25, n. b and 1968, pp. 15-16, no. 199. The relation of this rite to that of rth p't is noted in idem 1975, p. 164, n. c. For the rite at Edfu, see the following note. The notations of the festival calendar at Kom Ombo record that the rite was performed there for five days: \"Epiphi 19: Causing this god to appear in his beautiful festival called 'trampling fish'; reaching the upper court; trampling fish by this god; performing his rites; doing likewise until day 23, making 5 days; resting in his sanctuary.\" For the text and translation, see de Morgan 1909, p. 52 (no. 596), II. 14-15; idem 1895, p. 314 (no. 424), 1. 9 (dated incorrectly to Epiphi 10); and Alliot 1954, p. 527, n. 2. An allusion to the rite appears on a sketch for a Ptolemaic door inscription from the Faiyum, in which Sobek is said to have created the waterways(?) and the Mediterranean \"in order to catch confederacies of enemies as fish\"; see Winter 1967, pp. 68-72. A reminiscence of this ritual in the works of Apuleius and Plutarch is discussed in Derchain and Hubaux 1958 and Griffiths 1970, pp. Osiride, 7.353 D).209 oi.uchicago.eduTIlE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE and crocodiles in the fourteen-day Festival of Behdet at Edfu,970 where their symbolic interpretation is clearly stated: To know the interpretation of the trampling of the fish. They are the enemies who are in the water. As for these balls, they are the corpses of Napata. As for these gby.w-geese who are in these nets, they are the souls of the dead. As for these fans of dom-palm, they are their hair.971 The affiliation of this complex ceremony to the earlier \"breaking of the red pots\" is underscored by the processional route of the festival, for though the execration itself now takes place at the House of Life (as in Papyrus Salt 825), the procession first visited the burial-ground of Edfu-recalling the necropolis setting of the ancient ritual.972 A simplified version of this ceremony appears in Papyrus BM 10081, in which one slays birds and fish, while burni ,g on a fire of bryony a wax image of Seth placed in a fish skin.973 The existence Df yet further variants stressing burial rather than burning is attested by the unearthing of small limestone plaques, carved with bound images of Seth associated with prisoners, inverted crocodiles, pierced serpents and turtles (see figs. 19a and 19b).974 In one fashion or another, such rites were performed daily in temples throughout Egypt, so that-in the words of Posener-\"l'envoitement fut, de tout temps, une v6ritable institution.\"975 The crucial importance of this \"magical\" act for Egyptian \"religion\" can be seen not only from the numerous manifestations of the rite, but by its transmission from 970. See Alliot 1954, pp. 520)-27, 1928, pp. 132/3-134/9). 971. The rites are performed by the prophets, god's fathers, and scribes of the divine books. See Alliot 1954, pp. 521, 525, and 527. The balls, bnn.w (translated \"evils\" on p. 525), should be identified with the four balls used in the rite discussed in Goyon 1975; idem 1979, pp. 61-65 and pl. 25; and Ziegler 1979. The reference to the \"hair\" of the enemy is interesting, as locks of hair have been found in these balls, see Crompton 1916, p. 128 and pl. 16. For the possible presence of such balls at Mirgissa, see above, p. 161. Alliot 1954, pp. 525 and 527, failed to recognize either the term for geese (Wh 5: 164/5) or nets (Wlh 5: 555/2 and 4). The political significance of this cursing of Meroitic Napata is discussed in Vernus 1978. For the symbolism of fish and geese as enemies, see above, pp. 160-61. The ritual burning of fans painted with enemy figures is attested in the Eighteenth Dynasty (Hatshepsut, Chapelle Rouge): see Grimm 1988, especially p. 212 (though the Edfu parallel is not noted). The New Kingdom ritual is performed by a god's father and god's wife, in the company of other priests. 972. See Fairman 1954, pp. 197-98. 973. Schott 1956. The papyrus includes as well a \"royal\" rite, see idem 1930c, in which ore buries (!ms) a wax or clay figure of a royal enemy under an execution site together with a papyrus sheet inscribed in fresh ink with the enemy's name and that of his father and mother (p. 41). 974.

The recognition of variant Apep rites is evident from Pap. Bremner-Rhind itself, which includes several. Such recognition is also implicit in the section designations \"a book\" rather than \"the book\" for repelling Apep; see Lorton 1977. For the suggested Middle Kingdom origin, see Posener 1975b, p. 406. CT spell 414 (de Buck 1954, pp. 244-48) constitutes a spell for \"Driving Apep from the bark of Re,\" and may attest to the existence of a form of the rite at this period. 977. Contra Lexa 1925, vol. 1, p. 126, who views the temple rite as a secondary development from \"popular charms of the Middle Kingdom\"-specifically CT spell 37 (see p. 105), whose \"priestly\" rather than \"popular\" nature is noted above, p. 205. For private funerary use of the rite, see BD spell 7, addressing Apep as a wax execration figure: \"O one of wax ...\"; in Allen 1974, p. 9. An illustration of this performance is found in Shorter 1937. Textual parallels to the \"Apophis Book\" in Pap. Bremner-Rhind appear in later funerary texts, cf. the inscriptions of Sheshonk, the majordomo of the divine votaress Ankhnesneferibre, in Roccati 1973, pp. 26-27. Private performance of the ritual in the course of worship is evidenced by the \"Book of Gates.\" Addressed by Re as \"those who adore (me) and repulse Apophis from me,\" a group of individuals in the underworld are labeled \"Those who worshipped Re upon earth, who enchanted Apophis, who made offerings and who censed the gods\"; see Piankoff and Rambova 1954, p. 144 (first division, upper register) and compare also lornung 1980, pp. 92-96. Similar performance is attested at Deir el-Medineh in Pap. Chester Beatty 8, vo. 7/4, a spell \"privately\" owned by workmen in the village: \"I have fought for you against your Apophis,\" in Gardiner 1935, vol. 1, p. 74 and vol. 2, pl. 46. The intersection of royal and private conjurations of Apep in the Ramesside period is represented by a spell against snakes which parallels the Bremner- Rhind papyrus and which is found on a healing statue erected for public benefit by Ramses III; see An unpublished Ramesside ostracon in the Oriental Institute Museum (0. OIM 19120) may represent a private copy of a similar spell: \"said over an image of Apep made in [wax?J, put on fire, ground fine ...\" For later enactments of the rite, see Abdallah 1984, pp. 69-70 (11. 5-6): \"I [enchante]d the confederates of the evil snake, overthrowing the disaffected, the abomination of the Nm.t-bark, he being given over to the flame, the knife fixed in his head.\" From the same dynasty, a curse against potential violators of a decree for the divinized Amenhotep, son of H-lapu associates these \"enemies\" with those slain in the ritual destruction of Apep: \"May he (scil. Amon) put them on the brazier of the king on the day of his anger, let his uraeus vomit fire atop their heads to destroy their flesh; may it eat their bodies so that they become like Apep on the morning of the opening of the year (wp-rnp.t) ... They are for the knife on the day of destruction; Let them be termed Nkiw\" (\"The Vanquished One,\" a name of Apep); see Varille 1968, pp. 71 and 73-74 (11. 8-11). A reference to the popular performance of the rite perhaps underlies the gnomic remark in the \"Instruction \"One spits upon Apep\"; see Chassinat 1930, p. 79; Sauneron 1962b, p. 25; de Morgan 1909, p. Ii. 11-12; and Drioton 1926, pp. 46-47: 'Book of Overthrowing Apep' on this day.\" The rite may also have been used in the funerary ceremony of the Apis bull; see the ritual slri, Spiegelberg 1920a, p. 21.211 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE Figure 19.

Compiled for a temple, the papyrus ultimately became the private property of a priest.979 In the Roman Period, the ritual yet survived as a spell against snakes; in a Greek papyrus, a palm branch is broken so that the serpent, identified with Apep, might split in half like its mutilated counterparts in the Pyramid Texts of the second and third millennia B.C.980 As the redactor, compiler, and custodian of this \"institution,\" the priest played a pivotal role in its transmission as well. In the case of the \"harim conspiracy\" under Ramses III, such priestly involvement is easily documented and has long been recognized, for three of the conspirators were \"scribes of the House of Life,\" a fourth was a \"chief lector priest\" or professional magician (see below, pp. 220ff), and a fifth was an overseer of priests of the goddess Sakhmet.981 The last personage in particular appears to have played a significant 979. See above, n. 953. 980. Preisendanz 1931, p. 101 (PGM XII, 11. 260-64) and Betz 1986, p. 180. The magician recites seven times: \"Stop, for you are Apophis ('Acpqptg).\" This Greek rendering of app invalidates Gardiner's claim (1935, vol. 1, p. 30, n. 4) that the only authentic translation for the name of the serpent is \"Apopis\" ('Anontq). 981. The Turin Judicial Pap., col. 5/5: \"The great criminal Messui, who was a scribe of the House of Life, the great criminal Prekamenef, who was a magician (hry-tp), the great criminal Iyroy, who was overseer of the priests of Sakhmet ... the great criminal Shadmesdjer, who was a scribe of the House of Life.\" For the text and discussion, see Kitchen 1983a, p. 358; de Buck 1937, pp. 156 and 163, n. u; Posener 1976a, p. 437; and Gardiner 1938, p. 161, no. 13.

In such a capacity he would have had easy access to hostile spells,985 and it is notable that amid the indictments of an \"overseer of priests of Sakhmet\" in Papyrus Rifaud there is a possible mention of a \"sacred book of the House of Life.\"986 If correctly read, it is tempting to associate this book with the royal \"roll for giving terror and respect\" of Papyrus Lee, column I, which was improp- erly given to the conspirator Pn-hwy-bit'n.987 In both instances, consultation of the book led to an audience with a deity.988 In Papyrus Lee, this consultation, styled ph-ntr, was clearly 982. The context in Pap. Rifaud is necessarily unclear, owing to the preservation of this text only in a hand copy dating from 1834-36. For the complete text, see Sauneron and Yoyotte 1952 and Kitchen 1983a, pp. 363-66. The possible mentions of lyroy are Rifaud A/4 (= Kitchen (= Kitchen 1983a, p. 366/13-14).

Lee could have been performed secretly in a temple with cult images rather than in a private context with incubation or lamps.215 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE magical deity Heka is himself the patron of the process.1002 Indeed, the \"enigmatic\" spelling of the god's name with the ph-sign ('~-) produces a rebus ph-ntr which may not be entirely unintentional.1\u00b003 As the force of hk? is morally neutral, so direct petitioning of the god may serve hostile purposes (as in Papyrus Lee) or produce unfavorable results. It is particularly fitting that such eventualities, termed pht-n-ntr bin, \"an evil petitioning of god,\" were combated by magical protection in the form of oracular amuletic decrees granted by the gods and dispensed by the temples. In one such decree, Thoth declares: I shall nullify every evil ph-n-ntr, every evil upset(?), and every evil thing which has been done to NN the son of NN, the son of NN, my excellent servant; I shall make them recoil on those who did them, and I shall make them recoil on those who said 'do them.' I shall never allow them to have magical power (?/jw) over him throughout his whole lifetime.1004 Here the oracular process of the ph-ntr is clearly said to be capable of inflicting hostile magic (termed :iwlo005) which could be countered by correspondingly magical means. Mention of civil redress is conspicuously absent, for, as has been noted, the petitioning of deities for personal ends was inherently legal, with both hostile and beneficent oracles deriving from the same sanctioned temple rite-and potentially the same gods.1006 The perceived willingness of the consulted deity to provide either is consistent with a fundamental Egyptian belief in divine ambivalence, susceptible to threat and constrained 1002.

For the hostile use of ?hw by male and female magicians in these texts, see also Edwards 1960, vol. 1, p. 54, n. 47. It should be noted that these decrees specifically envision the manipulation of ?'hw by human practitioners, directly disproving the theory advanced by Borghouts 1987a. 1006. Compare the Ramesside petitioning of a series of statues of the same god (Amon) in hopes of a favorable verdict, discussed in Cem9 1962, pp. 40-41.216 oi.uchicago.eduPRIESTS AND PRACTITIONERS by magic in both cult and private ritual.1007 From this Egyptian view, it was not the conspirators who actually \"deranged\" the royal attendants of Ramses III, but the gods themselves, made subject to the power of hk? encoded in the temple rite. At once private and priestly, the ph-ntr epitomizes the Egyptian melding of the force of hk? within the legally sanctioned practices of religion. This situation is drastically altered with the conquest of Egypt by Rome, which had long viewed foreign religions with undisguised suspicion and hostility, often terming them \"superstitious\" or \"magical\" rather than \"religious.\" The term \"magic\" is itself indicative of this xenophobia; derived from the Zoroastrian religion of the Magi, magia had come to signify fraudulent trickery or demonic sorcery.lo()8 As such, it was pronounced illegal within the boundaries of Roman control for the duration of the empire, with edicts promulgated by Augustus, Tiberius, Claudius, Nero, Aurelius, Constantine, Constantius, Valentinian, The Egyptian approach to foreign religions and \"magic\" could hardly have been more different. No Egyptian word for \"superstition\" exists, and foreign practices were respected or feared rather than derided.1010 In fact, no term for \"religion\" exists either, the closest Egyptian approximation being sms (ntr), \"to serve (god).\"'0' In the course of such service, the Egyptian would have regularly performed legal acts which he would have termed hk?. To Roman eyes, these acts of hk? must have constituted magia. Before the defeat of Cleopatra, Egyptian practices in particular were often stigmatized as unfit for Roman citizens, and attempts to expel Egyptian cults from Rome were frequent and futile, 1007. This ambivalence is seen most readily in the personality of Sakhmrnet, for whose cult see above, n. 985. For the standard practice of threatening the gods, see above, n. 92. 1008. For references, see above, pp. 4 and 9. Although this conception was first developed in Greece, the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt responded quite differently to native religion. No laws disparaged Egyptian practice, and it is particularly notable that immigrant Greeks not only adopted Egyptian worship, but are well represented among the clients of surviving Egyptian \"magical\" papyri as well; see Artemesia and Wilcken 1927, pp. 97-104. 1009. For an of this legislation, see Parissoglou 1976, pp. 262-63. 1010. For Egyptian fear of foreign magic, see above, nn. 321 and 623. The same fear is evidenced by the amuletic decree cited above, which not only protected against the ph-n-ntr bin, but warded off equally Syrian, Egyptian, Bedouin, Libyan, and Nubian magic (Pap. BM 10587, 11. 71-75), in Edwards 1960, vol. 1, p. 38 and vol. 2, pl. 13. For such fears, see also Erman 1901, p. 14 (spell D, directed against Asiatic and Nubian women) and Koenig 1987b, on the role of Nubia in Egyptian magical texts. 1011. See Wh 4: 483-84. Morenz 1984, p. 22, suggested the comparable expression ir ifr.t, \"to perform ritual acts\" (see below, n. 1063). A later approximation is found 283; and Vycichl 1983, p. 240b.217 oi.uchicago.eduTIHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE occurring in 59, 58, 53, and 48 B.C.1012 Once Egypt was subject to Roman law, it was inevitable that Roman prejudice would clash with Egyptian practice. The most direct expression of this cultural conflict is found in a decree of Q. Aemilius Saturninus, prefect of Egypt under Septimius Severus in A.D. 199: [Since I have come across many people] who consider themselves to be beguiled by the means of divination [I quickly considered it necessary,] in order that no danger should ensue upon their foolishness, clearly herein to enjoin all people to abstain from this hazardous (or \"misleading\") superstition. Therefore, let no man through oracles, that is, by means of written documents supposedly granted in the presence of the deity, nor by means of the procession of cult images or suchlike charlatanry, pretend to have knowledge of the supernatural, or profess to know the obscurity of future events. Nor let any man put himself at the disposal of those who inquire about this nor answer in any way whatsoever. If any person is detected adhering to this profession, let him be sure that he will be handed over for capital punishment ...1013 Apparently promulgated only within Egypt, this prohibition of oracles encompassed the suppression of both the ph-ntr and amuletic decrees which are at once dismissed as nonreligious \"charlatanry\"-despite their accepted role in later Egyptian religion! As in Rome itself, the prohibition was unsuccessful, for in 359 an Egyptian oracle (of Bes at Abydos) again troubled Roman authority, prompting Constantius to decree a general abolition of oracles throughout the empire.1014 Coptic evidence shows that even this attempt was without success.10o5 Nonetheless, official Roman condemnation of these activities did produce a significant change. What had constituted public religion was now driven underground, becoming exclusively private practice.1016 Though of priestly origin, all Demotic examples of the phi- ntr (as well as the related Greek a{atcat; and abT6tnro) are for private use only, performed secretly in secluded quarters.1017 Only now could the practice be termed 1012. See Cumont 1956, p. 81. 1013. Papyrus Yale inv. 299, translation adapted from: Rea 1977 and Horsley 1981, pp. 47-51. For the text, see also Parissoglou 1014. 47-48 (seventh to eighth centuries). One should also contrast the famous oracles of the Coptic monk John of Lycopolis, deemed \"legal\"-since Christian-by the Byzantine emperors, with the illegal oracles of other local \"seers\"; MacMullen 1984, pp. 77 and 152, n. 15. 1016. The need for secrecy led also to the development of a cipher in which to write magical manuals; see Griffith and Thompson 1904, pp. 8-9; idem 1909, pp. 105-12; and J. H. Johnson 1977, p. 93. 1017. Demotic examples appear in Pap. Louvre E 3229, cols. 6/6, 11, 26, and 7/13 and in the Demotic Magical Pap. of London and Leiden, cols. 4/3, 8/12, and 28/32-33. For discussion in the Western sense ( i.e., \"illegal\" and \"private\") and then only from the Roman perspective. Egyptian reaction to the Roman prohibition is epitomized in the second century Greek tale of Thessalos, a physician from Asia Minor who traveled to Egypt in search of secret botanical cures. 1018 Having befriended priests in Thebes, Thessalos asked them if anything remained of Egyptian magical power (it i; payuci; vEpyEfa;) to conduct an audience with the gods or the dead. Although most appeared scandalized (pEp6vtov) by the question, an old priest agreed to conduct the rite with the aid of a bowl filled with water. After preparations and fasting, Thessalos was led to a secluded room-perhaps within a temple'019-where in a vision he confronted Aesclepius/Imhotep who answered his questions. The techniques of this procedure (bowl,1020 fasting, seclusion) accord perfectly with those in contemporary \"private\" Demotic (and Greek) papyri. Fear of Roman punishment for magia may have made the priests wary1021 and the rite secretive, but the ph-ntr experienced by Thessalos was still administered by an Egyptian priest as a identification, see J. H. Johnson 1977, pp. 90-91; contra Erichsen 1954a, p. 99, which suggests 0whs'- ntr, following the tentative reading whe proposed in Griffith and Thompson 1909, p. 22, no. 220. This discredited reading is still defended-without reference to unambiguous hieroglyphic equivalents-in Bresciani 1987, pp. 318-20. the Cunen 1960 V, 1-52). See also the Coptic \"bowl-inquiry,\" G)6NgIN, in Crum 1939, p. 685b. The practice continues in medieval Arabic and European tradition, see Lef6bure 1902 and for (related?) African usage, see 1018. Festugiere 1939; 1961, pp. 108-4)9; Segal 1981, pp. 371-72. 1019. The term is oib6;, which (like the word '.wy found in corresponding Demotic rites) may signify either a sacred or profane room. For the Greek term, see Festugibre 1939, pp. 61-62, n. 21 versus J. Z. Smith 1978, p. 180. 1020. For Demotic examples of bowl magic, see above, nn. 289 and 1017. The practice may be represented already in Middle Kingdom statuary that depicts individuals bending over a large vat or bowl-unless these figures are to be associated with brewing; see Capart 1944. Compare also the \"Alexander Romance\" of Pseudo-Callisthenes, in Wolohojian 1969, p. 23: \"[Nectonebo] went to his palace alone, took a basin, and, isolating himself, worked this sorcery of the basin. He poured spring water into his basin, and with his hands created ships and men from wax, and set the men upon the ships and put them into the basin.\" The Egyptian element in this tale is striking; similar manipulations of model ships and wax men are recorded of the Egyptian magicians Si-Wsir and Hir s? Pl-wnl, see above, n. 320. 1021. Traditionally, the priests' initial shock at the question of Thessalos has been interpreted in light of Roman prohibitions of magic, which entailed capital punishment for both performer and teacher. J. Z. Smith (1978, p. 179), however, has argued that it is rather an indication of their disbelief in the efficacy of magical power. This reinterpretation is unconvincing, given I) the centrality of hkI. to Egyptian religion even in the latest periods (which would entail priests professing disbelief in the religion which they serve), 2) the severity of Roman punishment for magic, and 3) the fact that Thessalos was a stranger to the priests, and a foreign Greek stranger at that. The most likely interpretation would be that the priests were unwilling to risk capital punishment for imparting secret (and sacred) knowledge to a foreigner who could not be trusted, and who should be excluded from such knowledge in any case.219 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE religious rite.1022 Despite imperial sanctions, Egyptian and Roman conceptions of \"magic\" did not merge until the Coptic period when Christian hostility stigmatized all pagan practices-Roman as well as Egyptian-with the derogatory magia. Stripped of its ancient theological significance, Coptic ?lK was now reduced to the same strictured range of meaning.1023 THE IDENTITY OF THE MAGICIAN The foregoing analysis of the ph-ntr reveals the intersection of religion and magic not merely in practice, but in practitioner, for as the priest was the author and compiler of magical spells and rites, so he was also the performer and \"magician.\" The role of the Egyptian priest as magician has long been recognized, especially for the , hry- hb. (t), or \"lector priest\" who recited incantations and hymns during temple and state ritual, as well as during private apotropaic magic and funerary htry-tp, ,J , was particularly associated with magical practices, and abridged to hry-tp, the title becomes the basic Late Egyptian and (as hry-tb, 4L~ ) Demotic word for magician,1025 transcribed in an Assyrian list of priests, doctors, and magicians as 1022. Contra J. Z. Smith's attempt (1978, pp. 180ff.) to describe the epiphany in the Thessalos tale as a reversal of the traditional priestly/temple context in favor of \"temporary sacrality sanctified by a magician's power\" (p. 182). The rite may well have taken place in a temple, and the magician responsible for the vision was definitely not Thessalos, but the traditional Egyptian priest trained in traditional temple practice. Compare also the temple-sponsored incubation vision of Aesclepius/Imhotep recorded in Pap. Oxyrhynchus XI.1381 (equally second century), translated in Grant 1953, pp. 124-27. 1023. I.e., fraudulent trickery or demonic sorcery. Whereas /hk' had been the duty and privilege of gods and priests, its Coptic descendant PIK is never acknowledged by Christ or saints. Instead, the term is applied to pagans and heretics: see above, p. 14. A similar fate befell astrology, adopted in Egypt (from Mesopotamia; see Parker 1959) as a priestly science (under the care of the imy-wnw.t), and subsequently proscribed by Roman and Christian law. 1024. The full writing of the title is hry-Ohb.t and signifies literally \"he who carries the festival scroll\"; see Sethe 1934. For general discussion, see Otto 1975; Gardiner 1917; idem 1947, vol. and Sauneron 1966, pp. 33-34. For examples of the role of the lector priest in magic, see above, p. 203, n. 944; p. 207, n. 956; and p. 213, n. 984. On the basis of archaic features in the \"Opening of the Mouth\" ritual, Helck (1984) has suggested that the earliest Egyptian magician was the s(t)m-priest, who functioned by shamanistic dream trance and adopted the leopard skin dress for animal transformations in the spirit world. Only as ritual became codified through writing was the inspired shaman replaced by the literate lector priest, whose office was in turn subjected to bureaucratic reorganization and hierarchical ranking. 1025. The title is attested from the Old Kingdom, and may have acquired specific magical significance at this earlier period, compare the titles of magicians in Pap. Westcar, discussed in n. 1031, below.

The duties of the \"fighter-priest\" in the Apophis rite are apparently those specified in the rubrics: \"Make for yourself (is ir n %k not understood by Faulkner 1937b, pp. 177 and 179; cf. cols. 24/19, 24/22, 26/3, etc., the pupil 0 for ir) every enemy of Re and every enemy of pharaoh either dead or alive and every accused one in his heart.\" With these ritual instructions in the second person in papyri one should compare the Edfu inscriptions published in Alliot 1954, pp. 521 and 524 Chassinat 1930, pp. 132-34): \"Engrave (a red wax hippo) with the names of the enemies in your heart, then you bring [...] 2 crocodiles ...\"; \"Do everything you know against them in the presence of this god.\"221 oi.uchicago.edu222 THE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE as either \"chief lector priest\" or \"scribe of the House of Life.\" 1031 The close affiliation of these terms is reflected in the fate of hartumirn in the Old Testament story of Joseph.

Although a third magician, Ddi, is only said to be a commoner (nds, col. 7/2), he nonetheless possesses books and perhaps students (hrd.w, col. 8/3-4) which strongly suggests priestly training and status-especially in the Old Kingdom when literacy was severely limited. The hero of the late hieratic Pap. Vandier, the magician Iy-R , is both a scribe and chief lector priest (see Posener 1985, pp. 16-17). The late equivalence of the lector priest and sacred scribe (sh mcj:.t nr, \"scribe of the divine book\") is discussed in Otto 1975, col. 941 and compare Alliot 1954, p. 518.

In the tale of Setna 1, both Setna and N?-nfr-k:-Pthi are royal children, trained to read writings of the House of Life (Griffith, ibid., pp. 90-91. 118-2 1. etc. ), and Setna was additionally High Priest of Ptah in Memphis (see Griffith. ibid.. pp. 1-12 and Gomait 1973).

Included among the last were four female dolls, a Beset037 statuette holding snakes, a bronze uraeus \"entangled in a mass of hair,\" and an ivory herdsman carrying a calf. The exterior surface of the box was covered with a white plaster slip, and the figure of a jackal was sketched in black ink atop the lid. Although the excavator did not recognize the significance of the find, a study of the contents of the papyri revealed the magical nature of the collection, for aside from two literary works, the texts are all ritual, magical, or \"medico-magical\" in substance.1038 The associated objects are equally at home within the sphere of magical accouterments: 1036. In the northern corner of the Ramesseum precinct; for discussion, see Quibell 1898, p. 3 and pls. 2-3. Aside from the papyri, the general contents of the box have received no further serious study. Significant inaccuracies flaw the popular treatment in Brier 1980, pp. 46-50, though the brief summary by David (1991, pp. 37-39) notes important similarities between these finds and the discovery of a Beset figurine, clappers, and a Bes mask buried in a \"magician's house\" at Kahun. 1037. The excavator, unaware of the existence of a female Beset, identified the figure as a dancer wearing a male Bes mask. For Beset, see Bosse-Griffiths 1977. The Ramesseum apotropaic knives and Beset figure are noted on pp. 102-03, though Bosse-Griffiths follows Quibell in describing the image as a nude woman with a mask. The same attribution was given in Wild 1963, pp. 79 and 81. Both Wild and Bosse-Griffiths note the existence of a single Bes mask, but that does not require that the statuette represent a masked figure. Despite a recent attempt to overemphasize ritual masking, the statuette- probably used in healing rituals (Bosse-Griffiths 1977, p. 103)-should be interpreted as the goddess and not as a human impersonator; see below, n. 1041. A statue, like a masked priest(ess), is an image used as an intermediary or conduit for divine power. A masked statuette is unnecessarily redundant- an image of an image of a deity. Wolinski 1986 and 1987 provides no cogent proof for her ill- conceived assertion that all deities with \"bizarre\" or ill-fitting (to Western sensibilities) heads are masked priests. Were such \"incongruities\" always to be explained by ritual masking, then the Giza sphinx must represent a lion wearing a human mask, criosphinxes would be lions masked as rams, and Horus-Sobek would be a crocodile wearing the mask of a hawk! For these hybrids, see Merz 1978 and te Velde 1980, especially p. 79. This statuette and a comparable example from Kahun are still considered \"masked\" in David 1991, pp. For the papyri, Gardiner 1955b, pp. 1-2 (identification as magical) and 7-18 (analysis of contents) and Barns 1956. Selected texts are translated in Borghouts 1978, pp. 43-44 (\u00a7\u00a769-70). Brier's statement (1980, p. 46) that the discovery of wax sons of Horus in the tomb shaft was \"the first clue that this was a magician's tomb\" is not credible. In the first place, these wax figures were explicitly recognized by the excavator as being of the \"XXllnd dynasty style\" (Quibell 1898, p. 3) and thus intrusive, with no relation to the earlier Middle Kingdom box. In the second place, such figures are standard burial equipment, and the use of wax in no way implies that they were intended for a magician (see Raven 1983, pp. 14-16).223 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE amulets (and beads as amulets'l39) for healing and security, apotropaic knives used to protect infants from demons,1040 statues of protective deities (the uraeus and Beset), and human figurines. The presence of the goddess Beset conforms to the imagery on the ivory knives where she also appears, with her power over noxious animals indicated by the standard device of the \"master of animals\" pose, used elsewhere by Heka, Horus, and underworld deities.1041 As a protective image, the uraeus is common,1042 and the use of hair as a personal effect or \"relic\" to strengthen a charm has been noted above for 1039.

By seizing beasts (snakes, scorpions, lions, lizards, gazelles, etc.), the central figure displays his or her domination of the animal and the hostile forces which it represents; compare CT spell 885 (de Buck 1961, p. 97): \"The snake is in my hand and cannot bite me, and so forth\" (Faulkner 1978, p. 49). For a parallel to the Ramesseum figure, see the instructions against snakes in the \"Book of the Heavenly Cow,\" II. 300-05: \"Make a female image standing on your southern side; make a goddess upon her (or \"it,\" i.e., \"the side\") in her (or \"its\") middle, (and) a serpent standing on its tail with her hand on its body\" (Hornung 1982, pp. 28 and 47).

The significance of the gesture is repeated on reliefs where the king grasps his hapless enemies by the hair (often collectively and thus clearly symbolically) before dispatching them as a sacrifice to the god; see above, pp. 115-16.

One should note, however, that two of the female images, depicted without legs, correspond to the so-called \"concubine\" figures used to promote feminine fertility.1045 The magical significance of the ivory herdsman has yet to be clarified,1046 but becomes evident when compared to an identical representation in a fording scene from the Old Kingdom tomb of Ti, in which a herdsman carries a calf into the water to induce the cattle to follow (see figs. 20a and 20b).1047 Similar fording scenes are not uncommon in tomb relief,1048 and are regularly accompanied by the recitation of a \"water spell\": 1043.

Let your face be very watchful for him!'1049 The Ramesseum ivory herdsman was almost certainly associated with just such a fording rite, probably as a substitute figure over which the charm could be recited during the crossing. It has generally been considered that these spells were recited by the herdsmen themselves,1050 but closer examination suggests that this was not necessarily the case. Representations of the scene from the tombs of both Ankhmahor and Mereruka do show the herdsmen extending their index finger in a protective gesture,ts5 but the recitation of the spell is left to a single individual at the left of the composition (see fig. 21 ).1052 Unlike the boatmen who physically row, gesture, or tow the calf, the speaker sits calmly, a wand in one hand, the other raised to his lips in the traditional attitude of recitation.1053 This division between recitation and ritual gesture accords with the charm-addressed to the herdsmen in the second person-and is paralleled by a fording spell in the Harris magical papyrus which stipulates that the charms must not be revealed to those outside the House of Life, though a \"man of the ship\" may execute the ritual act.1054 In another fording scene from the tomb of Ti, as the herdsmen extend their fingers, they are watched by a lone, standing figure at the left who is dressed in an elaborate kilt and leans upon a staff beside the water (see fig. 22a).1055 Urged by a herdsman to \"(Put) your hand over the water\" in the ritual gesture, the man replies instead: \"Do not speak so much!\"1056 Distinguished from 1049.

Wild 1953, pl. 113 and Duell 1938b, pls. 168-70). This may indicate that the herdsmen recited the spell in such cases, or it may represent a compression of the scene. In any case, the presence of the spell above such scenes primarily serves the purpose of funerary magic, guaranteeing the safety of the tomb owner's underworld herds and flocks; it may not precisely reflect practices of earthly life. 1053.

However, since priestly service was not a full time occupation but performed in rotation (see below, n. 1078). the stringent rules for shaving, purification, dress, et cetera. need only apply during active temple duty. Community magicians were presumably ofdutv priests, and thus exempt from such restrictions. This supposition is supported by the frequent necessity for specifications regarding ritual purity, clothing, and food taboos within the rubrics of individual spells. The non-exclusive nature of the occupation of lector priest in the Old Kingdom is evident from the inscriptions of Harkhuf (additionally a count, seal bearer, and expedition leader ISethe 1933, p. 122/13)), and Ankhmahor (also a chief overseer of works [Sethee 1933, p. 202/21). For the varying social ranks of such priests, see Otto 1975, p. 942. Perhaps comparable to the figure in the tomb of Ti, an \"ordinary lector priest\" (htry- zb ' ) appears within a list of household staff from the Middle Kingdom (Griffith 1898, p. 41 and pl. 14, 1. 52 [Pap.

Not surprisingly, individuals qualified by rh-h.t are given priestly titles as well,1064 and in Ptolemaic decrees the hieroglyphic rh-t.t is regularly rendered in Demotic as sh pr- h, \"scribe of the House of Life\" and in Greek as icpoypt lpawtin;, \"sacred scribe.\"1065 Thus despite the \"every-day\" quality of herding magic, the performers of the rite should have been trained magicians and 1061. See Wb 2: 443/27-31: contra Goedicke (1970, p. 253), who takes it as a term indicating general knowledge \"without entailing any formal education,\" ostensibly following Brunner (1966). Goedicke, however, misrep- resents the analysis of Brunner, who considers that the term basically signifies \"den Lebensklugen, (p. 32). As Brunner further notes, the acquisition of such knowledge requires training (\"Der Vater des Merikare rit seinem Sohn 32), and the examples gathered by Brunner consist primarily of the famous authors listed in Pap. Chester Beatty 4, who are specified as trained scribes (vo. 2/5) and lector priests (vo. 2/9) with (vo. 3/9), having \"concealed their magic (hkw) from the entire world, (though) it is read in a book of writing.\" For the passage, see above, p. 38. Similarly, in the literary Pap. D'Orbiney, the term is used of the \"scribes and sages\" of the palace who are able to interpret a mysterious lock of divinely-created hair (Brunner 1966, p. 32). 1062. Wb 2: 445/17-18 and compare 1954a, p. 252 and Thissen 1984, pp. 89-90.

Scribal training is equally clear from the presence of papyri which would have to be consulted and of pens with which to write amuletic charms. The appearance of state and funerary rituals1070 among the papyri emphasizes his priestly affiliation, while the literary texts have given rise to the suggestion that he \"combined with the sterner purposes of his profession the function of a local story-teller and entertainer.\"1071 It is the decoration of the box itself which provides the clearest indication of the professional identity of the Ramesseum magician, for the painted jackal atop the lid reproduces the hieroglyphic title T, hry-sst, \"He who is over the secrets.\"1072 Perhaps originally an epithet of Anubis guarding the Canopic chest of Osiris,1073 the title is applied 1066. The plural genitive (nw) in the phrase \"knowledgeable ones of the herdsmen\" need not imply that the \"knowledgeable ones\" were actually members \"of\" the herdsmen any more than the phrase \"servants of the masters\" would imply that the servants were themselves masters. 1067. Column 6/10 (\u00a7K, 1-4); see above, p. 203, 1068. As the basic term for \"magician,\" hkly can have both positive and negative connotations. The term, together with its feminine hk3y.t, appears in clearly negative contexts in the \"Book of the Heavenly Cow\" to describe threatening Egyptian magicians (see above, pp. 22 and 202-03), in a letter of Amenhotep II to his viceroy in Nubia to indicate hostile foreign magicians (see above, n. 623), and in the amuletic decrees to describe both Egyptian and foreign magicians who might bewitch the possessor of the charm (see above, n. 1010). 1069. For the title, see Gardiner 1917, p. 32. 1070. See Sethe 1928a (Pap. Ramesseum Ramesseum E). 1071. Gardiner 1955b, p. 1. As Gardiner further notes (p. 1), the combination of magical and literary papyri directly parallels the Chester Beatty library from Ramesside Deir el-Medineh. As at Deir el-Medineh, the literary papyri may have served for scribal teaching or personal pleasure/edification. 1072. Wb 4: 298-99. The significance of this feature was lost on Brier (1980, p. 48): \"The fact that the box in the magician's tomb had a jackal on it is curious. Anubis, the jackal-headed god, was the god of embalming and had no particular association with magic. A more likely candidate to be painted on a magician's box would be Isis, the goddess of magic.\" 1073. See Heerma van Voss 1969 and 1971.231 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE to officials with privileged access to cultic mysteries.1074 By the Middle Kingdom (and thus contemporary with the magician's box), hry-sst? had become a specific priestly rank.1075 The involvement of the hry-sst? in ritual and magic was such that by the Late Period the title was seemingly equated with that of the primary specialist in these areas, the lector priest (hjry-hib.t).'076 Such an involvement is already clear in the Middle Kingdom magician's box.1077 That a practicing priest should function as the community magician (thus obviating the necessity-and clientele-for any itinerant practitioner) was undoubtedly neither unusual nor unwieldy. It would certainly have posed no professional difficulty, since except for the very highest ranks, Egyptian priests did not work full time in the temple, but served in groups or \"phyles\" in rotation.1078 With four or more such phyles in service, priests would have had fully three quarters of the year off duty, and thus plenty of time for a \"private\" practice. Combining in himself the roles of composer, compiler, and performer, it is the priest alone who constitutes the \"private\" magician in ancient Egypt. As is evident from the title C4>PXNA (< \"scribe of the House of Life\"), an echo of this relationship between priest and magician survived even in Coptic terminology, when the suppression of pagan cults and clergy had long since recast the magician in the modern stereotype of a secretive, isolated seeker of arcane and forbidden knowledge. Of necessity, the scribal character of the magician remained, and is recognized in the term C2 N PECMOYT6, \"magician scribe.\"l079 Further Coptic royal, and cosmological secrets; see the range in Wb 4: 299. 1075. Wb 4: 299/2. 1076. See Derchain 1978. For the magical associations of the rank, compare the title hriy-sit? n p.t t? dw,.t, \"overseer of the secrets of heaven, earth, and the underworld\" (Wh 4: 299/12) with the magical enchantment of earth, heaven, and the underworld effected in Setna I, discussed above, pp. 61-64. 1077. One final question remains with regard to the box: why was it buried in a private tomb with papyri which were presumably temple property? Two answers may be suggested. Since not a single complete manuscript was recovered from the box, the damaged condition of the papyri (and other objects) may have led to their interment, corresponding to the customary burial of damaged sacred utensils, statuary, et cetera. The fragmentary state of the texts was already evident to the excavator; see Quibell 1898, p. 3 and Gardiner 1955b, p. 7, who suggests modem damage to account for the absence of complete texts. Alternatively, the Ramesseum box may represent a simple usurpation of temple property for \"private\" use, anticipating the practice of the Late Period; for which see above, n. 953. 1078.

If the Coptic pairing of 21K and magia opens the way for the legitimate use of the term \"magic\" in Egyptology, it must not be forgotten that this equation entailed the adaptation of native terminology to accommodate a Roman category further transformed by Christian belief. The resultant changes in religious meaning and social significance could hardly have been greater. Egyptian priests might prove their sanctity through laudatory declarations asserting mastery of hk (\"Never did any excellent magic [hk?] remain hidden from me.\").1091 For their Coptic counterparts, however, sanctity was proved by public denial of any familiarity with 21K or magia. Magia and its Coptic synonym must be understood primarily of disparagement, denoting unaccepted and thus \"sub- religious\" practicesl092 in which unorthodox gods are made demons and unorthodox worship made crime. Such a connotation is not applicable to hk:, and one may thus speak of indigenous \"Egyptian magic\" only with explicit restrictions. Unqualified use of the term necessarily indicates only the Roman, Christian, or modern concept superimposed on ancient practice. But while for both Romans and Christians it was meaningful to speak of \"Egyptian magic,\" the significance and range of such \"magic\" will have been interpreted differently even by these groups who shared the same terminology but not the same ideology. For either group, even the \"orthodox\" practices of the other were dismissed as magia.1093 The modern discomfort with the category \"magic\" is the direct legacy of the inherent subjectivity of this Roman concept. 1091.

Bell 1953, p. 74: \"But magic is after all no more than the disreputable basement in the house of religion.\" 1093. Coptic hagiographies are replete with topoi of Romans and Christians using the term magia at cross- purposes. Saintly \"miracles\" are consistently described by jailers and governors as Mfrlix and the saint as M rOC; typical examples appear in \"The Martyrdom of Macrobius\" in Hyvernat 1886, pp. 232, 234- 35 and D. N. Bell 1988, pp. 117 and 119: \"What shall we do with this magician (MhroC) ... who is casting multitudes of spells (Mxrl ) in the prison\"; and in \"The Martyrdom in Mina 1937, pp. 11 and 53-54: \"I swear to you by Jesus, this name through which you do magic (Mhlh) ... Truly, you are a scribal magician (C iJM rOC).\" Such accusations invariably lead to a counter-charge by the saint: \"The governor ... said to him: me, too, to make magic (Morl) like you.' ... The saint said to him: 'I myself am no magician (M IFOC), and may it never happen that I practice magic (Mrl ). Nor should this name of magician (MXrOc) be associated with any Christian. It is those who serve idols who have discovered all magic (Mhrl )'\" (\"The Martyrdom of Macrobius,\" in Hyvernat 1886, pp. 238-39 and D. N. Bell 1988, p. 122). In the related martyrdoms of Epima and Shenufe, the saint rebuts the charge by transferring it to the pagan clergy, citing the case of the M .FOC Astratole, high priest of Ashmunein, who descended into the underworld and escaped only by conversion to236 oi.uchicago.eduFROM hk? TO eIK: QUESTIONS OF DEFINITION AND DECLINE Designed more as a \"category of exclusion\" (that which is not X) than as a \"category of inclusion\" (that which is X), the inherited Western concept of \"magic\" is notoriously difficult to define. Its suggested components are disputed,1094 and those criteria generally adopted depend primarily upon perceived emotions and attitudes of the practitioner- adding yet another level of subjectivity to a classification already vague. Given the failure of such criteria to delineate an unambiguous sphere of \"magic,\" a new approach was attempted in which \"activity\" was selected as the diagnostic criterion. Maintaining the traditional interpretation of magic as unorthodox practice, and selecting the \"rational causality\" of the post-\"Enlightenment\" to represent orthodoxy, magic in the modern Western sense is defined as any activity which seeks to obtain its goals by methods outside the simple laws of cause and effect.1095 Using such a \"working definition,\" the identification of \"magical\" elements within spells, rituals, literature, and archaeological artifacts is relatively simple, and a brief selection of these are surveyed: circumambulation, spitting, licking, swallowing, the use of images, superposition, trampling, binding, the use of red, breaking, the use of sand, burning, numerological symbolism, piercing, reversal, burial, the use of the dead, and oracular consultations. This definition of \"magic\" yields explicit results by accepting certain equally explicit presuppositions. \"Magic\" is not seen as a universal category of equal applicability across time and space (contra all early anthropology, certain modern theorists of comparative religion, and most Egyptological treatments). Inherent in the term is the subjectivity of cultural bias, and thus \"magic\" must be understood with reference to a specific cultural context. This working definition openly recognizes and incorporates the Western bias of the present scholarly category. Rather than intuit the attitude and bias of the ancient (or foreign) practitioner, this approach openly declares those of the researcher. Thus are produced results which are useful for description and organization within a specific scholarly framework, but which must not be confused with ancient (or foreign) Christianity. Astratole's remarkable descent into hell was \"magic\"; his equally remarkable ascent was not; see Mina 1937, 18-19 and White 1926, pp. 102-03 (where Astratole is ultimately cast as a martyr). The capricious nature of these accusations was already evident to Celsus in his contemporary critique of early Christian propaganda: \"Is it not a silly sort of argument to reckon by the same works that one man is a god whilst his rivals are mere 'sorcerers?'\" (Hoffmann 1987, p. 66). 1094. See now the overview and critique of Gutekunst 1986 and 1987 and compare Altenmuiller 1980. 1095. I.e., the laws of causality as understood by the modern researcher. By concentrating exclusively on modem concepts for the modern definition, confusions regarding the perceptions of causality by the ancient practitioner become irrelevant, thus obviating the dilemma posed above, pp. 69-70 and the critique of Gutekunst 1986, cols. 1323-24.237 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE interpretation.'096 Such a treatment is directly analogous to the superimposed use of \"verb,\" \"noun,\" \"adjective,\" et cetera, in analyses of Egyptian grammar, and subject to the same limitations.1097 Yet while the artificial nature of such grammatical terminology has long been recognized in linguistics, the equally artificial terminology of \"magic\" and \"religion\" has generally gone unnoticed. Few would argue that \"verb\" is an invariable, universal concept, that the Egyptian \"verb\" must be analyzed exactly as the English \"verb,\" or that the Egyptian \"verb\" must have been understood similarly by ancient speaker and modern scholar. The previous sentence would no longer be true were \"magic\" to be substituted for \"verb.\" Scholarly terminology should be recognized for what it is: imposed descriptive approximations and not found universal \"truisms.\" In particular, \"magic\" and \"religion\" (like \"verb\") are Latin concepts specifically meaningful within Latin culture, its derivatives and descendants. They can only represent an artificial framework for study when used of alien cultures. 1098 The Aristotelian \"urge to classify\" so central (as to be subliminal) in Western thought often obscures the synthetic nature fundamental to all classification. Almost unavoidable is the resultant tendency to assume that classifications are universally valid \"objects\" to be discovered rather than artificial (if not arbitrary) tools contrived for descriptive purposes. As a consequence, outmoded classifications are jealously maintained, contrary classifica- tions devised, and new categories are proliferated as ends in themselves.1099 Such has 1096. This incongruity of modern and ancient categories is equally notable in discussions of Egyptian botany, zoology, anatomy, and color terminology. Thus the color term wid, conventionally translated \"green,\" included both modern \"blue\" and dir, \"red\" included shades of \"orange,\" \"yellow,\" \"pink,\" et cetera. The danger of confusing Egyptian with modern categorization in these areas is well discussed in Weeks 1979. Mesopotamian color terminology is no less \"culturally specific\" (see Landsberger 1969). 1097. The artificial nature of traditional grammatical terminology is easily documented: the \"adjective\" in Coptic is rather a \"noun\" in an attributive position, \"aorist\" in Egyptian grammar does not have the same range of meaning as in Greek grammar (from which the term is taken), et cetera. Paralleling the ambiguity of the categories \"magic\" and \"religion,\" present grammatical categories are also not mutually exclusive, with such terms as \"nominalized participles,\" \"nominalized adjectives,\" and \"verbal nouns\" (infinitive). Recent attempts to modify terminology produce similarly artificial structures, see the summarizing remarks in J. H. Johnson 1986a, pp. 401-02. 1098. Compare the common designation of American Indian or African \"charged substances\" as \"medicine\"-while comparable materials in Europe or the Near East are designated \"magic.\" 1099. See my remarks (1987). A particularly flagrant example of multiplying categories as ends in themselves can be found in the five divisions offered by Gordon for Sumerian \"proverbs\" (cited in Thissen 1984, p. 8). The suggested technical distinctions between \"precept,\" \"maxim,\" \"truism,\" \"adage,\" and \"byword\" are obviously arbitrary formulations since the terms are merely synonyms in English. Their descriptive usefulness for modern study is doubtful, and the terms certainly do not derive from, nor do they reflect, Sumerian thought.238 oi.uchicago.eduFROM hk> TO QIK: QUESTIONS OF DEFINITION AND DECLINE clearly been the case with many of the modern discussions of \"magic.\" The anthropological misuse of Evans-Pritchard's Zande category of \"witchcraft\" is noted above (pp. 10-12), and the attempted \"discovery\" of this category within Egyptian magic by Borghouts (above, p. 11) displays clearly the inherent weakness of such generalizations, since in Egypt \"witchcraft\" is but a category without content. The cultural strictures on this subsection of \"magic\" are no less applicable to the concept of \"magic\" as a whole. Though generally abandoned in anthropology, the global approach to magic has not been laid to rest. In 1982, sociologist Daniel O'Keefe published Stolen Lightning: The Social Theory of Magic, an attempt to present \"a general theory of magic: that means a complete explanatory account of the whole thing, past and present, all the provinces, rather than a single hypothesis.\"100 Dismissing contextual studies as \"too slack to explain propounds a \"non-deductive\" approach using \"theories as data.\"1102 The ensuing analysis, synthesis, and generalizations are thus conducted almost entirely within the framework of competing modern Western theoretical interpretations. If the discussions and conclusions thereby engendered say much about these varying theoretical approaches, they say very little about actual practice within individual societies. This is particularly evident where the author strives to incorporate Egyptian evidence. By proclaiming dogmatically that \"magic is, in general, a case of expropriating social forces,\"1103 and \"symbolism expropriated to protect the self against the social,\" 1104 O'Keefe enshrines the Western conception of magic as \"contrary\" activity, antithetical to established religion, state, and society. Egyptian institutionalized \"magic\" simply cannot be seen in these terms, and thus the author is forced to devise a special category (\"religious magic\") which is only \"magical 'in the weak sense'.\"1105 By circular argument, O'Keefe finds that established \"religious magic\" is not (by his definition) true \"magic\" since it is not I 100. O'Keefe 1983, p. xv. 1101. Ibid., p. xvi. 1102. Ibid., p. xvi. I 124. 1 p. xviii. 1105. Ibid., pp. 6 and 213-14.239 OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE a \"peripheral\" institution.10\u00b06 Such a generalization certainly obscures more than it clarifies. 1107 Ultimately, O'Keefe's argument is but a tempest within the teapot of Western theory: it shows the ways (and terms) in which the West has construed a problem which the West has devised, and it offers yet another construction. O'Keefe declares that \"magic is real\" precisely because his cultural and theoretical background has utilized the concept, however unsystematically. The title of the work itself betrays this unrecognized cultural bias, for \"stolen lightning\" refers to the Greco-Roman myth of the theft of fire by Prometheus for mankind-for O'Keefe as for Aeschylus (Prometheus Bound) and Shelley (Prometheus Unbound) a symbol of the revolt of the individual against authority. In Egypt, \"magic\" as hk was not a theft but a gift from the gods, and thus \"stolen lightning\" is an inappropriate metaphor, and the implied antithesis of \"state religion\" and \"individual magic\" is false. As eloquently phrased by Patrick Grim in a review of Stolen Lightning: 'Magic,' after all, is a term stemming from our cultural traditions, and is laden with the particular associations, ambiguities, and overtones of its place within that cultural tradition. ... [Like 'marriage' and 'political party',] it may be that the notion of 'magic' does not export well. These terms have an established use at home in our culture, of course, but that is no guarantee that they will be fruitful or even usable in trying to understand some other culture. What a careful reading of the ethnographic data shows, I suggest, is that voodoo and mana and taboo are very different things in their different cultural and historical contexts. ... Perhaps we ignore or distort important differences by calling these all 'magic' or by grouping them all under any one term. Perhaps we will have to learn more about them, 1 106. O'Keefe 1983, p. 213. As an example of \"true magic\" in relation to \"religion,\" O'Keefe (following the religion/magic dichotomy advanced by Budge) calls attention to threats against the gods as religious rites \"burlesqued, done backwards or otherwise travestied, because magic has its own aims which are always somewhat illicit and often hostile to religion\" (p. 124). While this description fits the \"Black Mass\" of Christian tradition which was the author's obvious source of inspiration, it is absolutely inapplicable to Egyptian tradition in which such threats are not \"burlesques of religious rites\" but often an integral, legal part of those religious rites! O'Keefe's notions of what should constitute religion, piety, legality, and magic are rigidly circumscribed by Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian values; outside this narrow sphere they have limited or no validity. 1107. Compare the extremely oversimplified analysis (merging Marx and Wittfogel) offered by O'Keefe (1983, pp. 366-68), which construes Egyptian religion and magic as govemrnment monopolies designed to be tools of domination by promising the \"magic goal of immortality.\" Sumerian religion and magic, though still government monopolies, are somehow less \"magical\" since \"the Sumerian cities, organized on a religious basis, did not preach the magic goal of immortality as did the magician kings of Egypt\" (p. 368). This blanket condemnation of \"religious magic\" (O'Keefe's category) provides no insights into Egyptian (or Sumerian) \"religion\" or \"magic\"; it merely presents the author's own opinions on the subject of religion and immortality. O'Keefe's discussion further suffers from the outdated or \"popular\" sources on which he relies, a common failing of \"generalist\" historians outside their realm of competency.240 oi.uchicago.eduFROM hk > TO ?IK: QUESTIONS OF DEFINITION AND DECLINE individually and in context, before attempting to deal with them in terms of any larger general categories.1108 The present study of \"magical mechanics\" attempts precisely that, an investigation of Egyptian practice \"individually and in context.\" The sharp deviations thus revealed between pharaonic Egyptian and modern Western conceptions of \"magic\" are unmistakable, and far too significant to be dismissed by uncritically subsuming both categories within a general theory. In scholarly discussion, the two constructs must always be rigorously separated-not subordinated-\"otherwise we, in vain, attempt to contain water in a net and catch fish in a shovel.\"l 109 The futility of any attempt to subordinate Egyptian to Western notions of \"magic\" is well represented by Wilfried Gutekunst's discussion of \"Zauber\" for the final volume of the Lexikon der Agyptologie, a counterpart and foil to Borghouts' presentation of \"Magie\" in the first volume of the series.1 11 Starting from the pretext that within non-Egyptological literature the German synonyms \"Zauber\" and \"Magie\" have on occasion been treated as distinct-though vaguely defined-concepts, Gutekunst undertakes a survey and critique of suggested criteria for determining \"magic\" on a global scale. While this pretext permits a second discussion of a difficult problem, Gutekunst's article is concerned less with the examination of Egyptian conceptions than with the justification of Western theory. The supposed distinction between \"Zauber\" and \"Magie\" rapidly proves to be exclusively a matter of Western speculation, the special nuance of \"Zauber\" deriving only from its equation with Evans-Pritchard's over-generalized term Grim's conclusions are apt: \"... Stolen Lightning is not a good book. Yet the reasons it is not a good book are important reasons, and themselves have something to tell us about the nature of magic\" (p. 93). \"All in all, Stolen Lightning gives the impression of being a peculiarly anachronistic book; it belongs among the great volumes of the nineteenth century anthropological and sociological theory. Those were magnificent pieces of work. But we are well beyond them now\" (p. 95). 1109. The sixteenth century neo-pagan philosopher Giordano Bruno commenting on the inability of Aristotelian and contemporary Christian concepts to describe the essence of Egyptian religious magia; see Bruno 1964, p. 238 and Yates 1964, p. 213. Though Bruno's interpretation of Egyptian magic was hampered by the limitations and inaccuracies of his sources, his attempt to analyze Egyptian practice from an Egyptian perspective remains commendable and revolutionary, predating the scholarly advocates of the \"emic\" approach by four centuries. 1110. Gutekunst 1986. For Borghouts' article on \"Magie,\" see 1980. Borghouts' methodology is certainly to be preferred, since he derives his theories from an initial presentation of Egyptian evidence. In contrast, Gutekunst presents his \"global\" theoretical interpretations first, with Egyptian conceptions following as an appendage (\u00a7B). I 11. Gutekunst 1986, col. 1336, n. I.241 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE Of necessity, the Egyptian material covered by Gutekunst is exactly the same as that previously reviewed by Borghouts. Like the present study, Gutekunst faults traditional definitions of \"magic\" for their vagueness and imprecision.1112 In the course of this critique, he also objects to the use of the \"natural law of causality\" as a universal index of \"magical\" practice, since many acts deemed \"religious\" are also outside this \"law,\" and since varying cultures will have their own world view with their own understanding of what constitutes \"natural causality.\"ll3 In an attempt to salvage the general applicability of the Western term \"magic,\" he thus proposes a compromise in which certain \"religious\" practices would be reclassified as \"magic\" in a \"wider sense,\" while \"magic\" in a \"narrow sense\" would be limited to the sphere of the magician and the magical spell.1ll4 Gutekunst's revival of Roeder's \"wide\" and \"narrow\" magic hardly more helpful than O'Keefe's \"true\" and \"weak\" magic. Nor is the determination of \"magic\" simplified by making the distinction of \"magic versus religion\" contingent upon that of \"magician versus priest\" and \"magical spell versus ritual recitation or prayer.\" As the present study demonstrates and as Gutekunst has tacitly recognized, within the Egyptian world view there is no distinction between magician and priest, spell and prayer, nor ultimately between religion and magic since a recognized category of \"religion\" did not even exist. If reliance upon the \"natural law of causality\" (or any other criteria, for that matter) produces only a Western interpretation and not a universal definition of magic, it is because \"magic\" is a distinctly Western concept, and a universal definition simply cannot exist. Each \"world view\" must be examined individually. In common with Western \"magic,\" Egyptian hk? represents a force that is secret (sSt:)' ll 6 powerful (I, phtyI),1117 and superhuman (Hk?, ttr).1118 Beyond these basic characteristics the similarity ends. As Stolen Lightning represents a failed attempt to construct a universal definition of magic, Gutekunst's 1112. The examined and rejected criteria for determining \"magic\" include the attitude of the practitioner (manipulation of versus subjection to higher powers), the dependence of the activity on the law of causality (the definition adopted within this study), the \"supernatural\" goals of the process, the reliance on \"secret and miraculous\" powers to effect the goal, and the dichotomy of state/orthodoxy versus individual/private actions. 1113. 1115. p. 70. 1116. For the association of .k\" with secrecy (sita), see above, pp. 202--04. 1117. For these terms and their associations with .see above, pp. 30-35 oi.uchicago.eduFROM hk TO 21K: QUESTIONS OF DEFINITION AND DECLINE discussion catalogues the failed attempts to apply such definitions specifically to ancient Egyptian practice.1119 No more successful are the recent attempts to substitute alternate global categories for the failed dichotomy of \"religion versus magic.\" Thus the suggested distinction of \"calendrical ritual versus crisis rite\"1ll120 is confounded by such execration texts as the \"Apophis Book\" which span both categories, being performed at calendrical ceremonies as well as on a daily basis as a \"cultic crisis rite\" for the protection of the deity and individual suppliants. Since the same text, ritual activity, and performer were involved regardless of whether the ceremony was enacted at regular intervals or when individual need (\"crisis\") arose, the contrast of calendrical and crisis rites proves to be but a distinction without a difference. More fundamental objections can be raised against Silvio Curto's suggestion of a tripartite division (derived from anthropological models of civilization stages), in which \"magic\" describes the world view of the primitive hunter and gatherer (pre-First Industrial Revolution), \"religion\" that of the post-Revolution farmer, and \"neo-magic\" the outmoded, irrational survival of archaic \"magic\" in the \"cultural substratum\" of the post-Revolution system, ready \"to re-emerge whenever advanced culture declines.\"1121 Though simple, this system is clearly unworkable as a descriptive paradigm for Egypt, since the world view of the primitive Egyptian hunter (Curto's \"magic\") is largely unknown and unknowable, and where survival of this world view may be supposed it is not relegated to an inferior cultural substratum, but is fully incorporated in the world view of the \"post-Revolution\" civilization, leaving no distinction between Curto's \"religion\" and \"neo-magic.\"1122 The diachronic \"revolutions\" in thought which his analysis presupposes simply cannot be traced, though the sources for his theory can. The inspiration for Curto's category of \"neo-magic\" is certainly Egypt's well-known cultural conservatism with its retention of ancient rites, myths, et cetera throughout its documented (\"post-Revolution\") history. There is, however, no justification for assuming that these \"survivals\" were merely outmoded \"cultural baggage,\" 1119. A similarly negative conclusion regarding the universality of Western theory is now reached in Gutekunst 1987, essentially a re-edition of his study in 1986, cols. 1320-26, but substituting a final rejection of the religious/magic dichotomy (p. 94) for the proposed \"compromise\" that termnninated the earlier study Titiev 1960; cited with approval in Serensen 1984, p. 6. 1121. Curto 1984, pp. 717-18 further elaborated in 1987. 1122. Compare the direct continuation of the \"smiting scene\" from pre-dynastic to Roman times (discussed above, pp. 113-16) with no discernible change of meaning or of cultural stratum.243 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTI77AN MAGICAL PRACTICE opposed or inferior to contemporary religious concepts. On the contrary, as is witnessed by the continuity of execration practice from the Old Kingdom through the Greco-Roman periods, it seems that traditional religious elements were maintained precisely because they did conform or could be assimilated to contemporary thought. Underlying Curto's suggestion that a recrudescence of \"neo-magic\" would accompany the decline of higher civilization is the oft-repeated but fully unsubstantiated belief that \"magical\" practices increased at the expense of \"religion\" as Egyptian history \"declined\" after the New Kingdom,' 123 culminating in the debased and foreign magic of the Greco- Roman eras.1124 The evidence adduced for this supposed \"increase\" does not, however, 1123. Curto 1984, p. 731: \"Starting from the XIX dynasty the sepulchral furnishings and mummies make an ever more increasing use of amulets and the Stelae of Florus on crocodiles and statues with healing powers become popular.\" For the supposed rise in magic after the New Kingdom, see Breasted 1968, pp. 223-71: Kikosy 1974, p. 39; and Kadry 1982, p. 204: \"In comparison with the pre-'Amirna period, magic, in the Ramesside period, came more to the fore than earlier.\" A similar increase in the Late Period is suggested in Kikosy 1977, col. I 110 and compare Drioton (1928, p. 54), who decried a late tendency to subordinate god to magic, in defiance of the \"great tradition\" of Egyptian religion, \"celle d'une veritable religion de dont le Code 6tait morale, contre les empi6tements de la magic.\" Drioton's assessment of an original, pristine Egyptian \"great tradition\" on \"spirit\" and \"moral law\" free from \"impious magic\" betrays an obvious Christian bias at odds with all Egyptian evidence for the inherent-and pivotal-role of hk: in the \"great tradition.\" The supposed late \"warning\" against magic published in this note by Drioton is in fact a praise of magical healing statues as civic benefactions approved by Re; see above, n. 81. Late Coptic magic has also been seen as evidence of a decline, even while acknowledging its continuity from pre-Christian origins (Drescher 1948, p. 276). 1124. For the dismissal of later Egyptian religion as \"dreary formalism\" replaced on the popular level by \"material\" and \"trivial\" magic, see II. I. Bell 1953, pp. 13 and 71-74. The assumption of \"dreary formalism\" is no more than an unsubstantiated guess to explain the rise of Christianity at the expense of Egyptian cultic religion. Coptic sources, however, often reveal the devotion of their pagan opponents (in hostile terms, of course) even during the period of the Christian triumph, when pagans were frequently converted by the threat of torture or of property seizure; compare the tale of Macarius of Tkou translated in Lexa 1925, vol. 2, pp. 219-22 and that of Macedonius translated in Budge 1977b, p. 961. Social, political, and economic concerns were certainly factors as important in conversion as religious \"fonrmalism\"; compare the relative importance of economic versus theological concerns in the writings of the archimandrite Shenute. discussed in Barns 1964, pp. 154-56 and 158. In any case, the popular practice of \"material\" and \"trivial\" magic (as understood by H. I. Bell) continued unabated in the Coptic period. Coptic description of contemporary pagan religious texts as \"magical\" (Barns ibid., p. 153) is meaningless, since in Coptic eyes all pagan religious texts were necessarily \"magical.\" For the supposed \"alien character\" of late magic. compare the description of Demotic magical texts in Borghouts 1974, p. 17: \"Though the mythology is still egyptian for a large part, the spirit is strikingly different from that of earlier magic: productive and destructive magical spells abound (love spells, catching spells, divination procedures, spells for harming people) while the procedures are described in extenso. Evidently, these magical texts cannot be considered the immediate continuation of <older, magic and they should be studied in connection with magical texts from greek and semitic sources.\" Despite Borghouts' negative characterization, careful scrutiny of these texts reveals that they244 oi.uchicago.eduFROM hk; TO eIK: QUESTIONS OF DEFINITION AND DECLINE reflect a fundamental qualitative change in Egyptian thought or practice, merely a quantitative increase in the evidence of objects1125 and actions which had long been central to Egyptian culture: a greater proliferation of amulets, healing statues, magical/ritual papyri, incantations within medical texts, or mention of the god Heka within theological texts. The pivotal role of Heka is fixed in the Old and Middle Kingdoms,1126 and incantations accompany treatments in the earliest medical texts. 1127 The use of amulets, images, and spells to preserve the living and the dead was an integral element of the Egyptian world view at all periods. The increase in the availability of these constant features is a result of the progressive \"democratization\" of Egyptian religious prerogatives, comparable to the increase in (\"magical\") funerary texts from the restricted royal Pyramid Texts to the more common upper-class Coffin Texts to the widely distributed, popular Book of the Dead, Book of Breathings, et cetera.1128 The development of new forms of healing generally share not only the same mythology with older Egyptian spells, but also the same \"world view,\" symbolism, purpose, as well as verbal and ritual methodology. In particular, the present study seeks to demonstrate the direct affiliation of Demotic \"love spells, catching spells,\" and \"spells for harming people\" with traditional execration procedures (see above, Chapter 4). As noted frequently above, the similarity of Demotic spells to the Greek magical papyri most often derives from the common use of older Egyptian sources by bilingual Egyptian scribes; see further the extensive discussion in Ritner 1995. 1125. Compare Ramesside use of the \"prisoner motif,\" discussed above, pp. 122-31, especially n. 585. 1126. See above, Chapter 1. 1127. Compare Griffith 1898, p. 10, Prescription XXX (Middle Kingdom). For the misleading distinction between medical and magical cures, see above, pp. 5, 49-57, 78-82, 88-89, and 93-96. 1128. Economic factors in this process cannot be ignored. The development in the New Kingdom of a town- centered bureaucratic and artisan \"middle class\" with disposable income readily provided the market for such culturally-desirable goods. Had peasants of previous periods been able to afford such objects, an industry would have certainly developed to provide them. Amulets were no less desirable-and no less \"magical\"-in the Old Kingdom than in the New. The evidence for much of this proliferation (i.e., the \"magical\" texts on ostraca and papyri) is confined to Deir el-Medineh, whose special religious and economic status is well known; see above, pp. 206-07.245 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE statues in the New Kingdoml129 does not imply an increase in \"magic\" any more than the contemporary increase in temple construction implies increased religiosity. Like the temple, amulet, image, and ritualized spell were the primary ingredients of Egyptian ceremonial practice for the duration of its existence. Being the essence of religion, they cannot grow at the expense of religion. Even the presence of foreign elements in the latest Demotic spells does not constitute an \"alien magic,\" divorced from traditional religion. The practice simply continues the syncretistic nature of Egyptian theology, absorbing Nubian, Greek, and Semitic elements1130 as the New Kingdom had assimilated the gods (Baal, Astarte, Reshep, and Huruna) and spells of its neighbors (Cretan and Semitic).1131 Far from being stagnant and moribund, late Egyptian religion still assimilated its traditions to contemporary thought. The clearest expression of this dynamic interaction between traditional practice and contemporary thought is found in the Egyptian influence upon the development of Neoplatonist Theurgy (\"performing the works of god\"), a melding of 1129. E.g., the cippi of \"Horus on the Crocodiles,\" noted above, p. 207, n. 956. These amuletic statuettes are innovations in form only, being part of a continuum of \"healing images\" attested at all periods that includes not only other small amulets and figures of faience, clay, wax, wood, metal, or stone, but also vignettes on papyrus and large scale images of healing \"intermediaries\" depicting a deity (the portable image of Khonsu in the Bentresh Stela), the divine king (the \"healing statue\" of Ramses III), or the blessed dead (Amenhotep son of Hapu's statue at Thebes, the \"healing statue\" of Djed-hor, etc.), and even living and dead sacred animals. The underlying rationale for the effectiveness of such figures was no different than for the cult image in the temple. If that principle is to be called \"magic,\" then \"magic\" was necessarily a constant element in Egyptian religion that cannot be meaningfully said to have increased or decreased. Even the Amarna period probably does not constitute an exception, since it merely substituted one set of numinous imagery for another. Akhenaton's zealous destruction of figures of Amon is a traditional response to the \"magical\" potency of imagery. 1130. For Nubian spells, see Pap. BM 10588, col. 7, in Bell, Nock, and Thompson Ritner 1986a. and Griffith and Thompson 1904, p. 193 (vo. 20).

For the late fear of Nubian magic, see the romance of Setna II, discussed above, n. 321. For Greek and Semitic elements, see Betz 1986, passim. As often noted, the phenomenon of vox barbarica or so-called \"magical nonsense words\" is probably related to the use of foreign incantations and \"names of power\"; compare the outlandish names of deities in BD spells 162-65 (Allen 1974, pp. 157- 62) \"A of the Asiatic the in Wreszinski 1912, pp. 151-52 and 192; Borghouts Gordon Wainwright 1931, pp. 27-30; Lange 1927, pp. 93-94 (col. 1/8-9 = Spell Y, I. 28) and 98 (col. 12/1-5 = Spell Z). Compare also Pap. Ebers 422: \"Another remedy for eyes which an Asiatic of Byblos told.\" The use of foreign magic in the New Kingdom derives from the cosmopolitan character of contemporary society, no longer isolated from cultural contact. For fear of Nubian and Asiatic sorcery, see above, n. 1010.246 oi.uchicago.eduFROM hk TO p1K: QUESTIONS OF DEFINITION AND DECLINE philosophy, religion, and ceremonial \"magic.\"132 In its positive recognition of \"magic\" as a technique within religion, Theurgy reflects Egyptian notions of hk? rather than Latin concepts of magia, and the term provides perhaps the best designation of Egyptian \"magico-religious\" theology. Within its own \"world view\" Egyptian hk? was of far more exalted significance than its Coptic descendant or Western approximation. Amoral and quintessentially effective (?h), a power to which gods, men, and all of nature were subject, it was still the same force whether used by god, king, priest, private individual, rebel, or foreign enemy, whether hostile or beneficent, sanctioned or suppressed. As the pre-eminent force through which the creator engendered and sustained the ordered cosmos, it was necessarily the dynamic \"energy\" which Egyptian religious ritual sought to channel that it might effect its identical goal, the preservation of the creator's universe. The cultic manipulation of this \"energy\" by recitation, substance, and ritual thus constituted a sophisticated system of \"practical theology,\"\"33 a \"theurgy\" in which the priest quite literally \"performed the works of god.\" Conforming to the classical anthropological terminology of Arnold van Gennep, Egyptian \"magical\" acts are best understood as the technique of religion, the \"magical mechanics\" of cultic worship.1134 These mechanics are sanctioned not merely by practice, but by patron. \"Before duality yet arose,\" Heka was formed to generate the multiplicity of creation, and the means by which he performed this task illuminates not only the methodology of the force of Ihk, but its larger significance in the Egyptian understanding of the nature of the universe as a whole. Heka did not fabricate the universe ex nihilo; rather he reproduced as terrestrial \"doubles\" (kas, k?.w) the acts and logos of the demiurge.' 135 As Nb-k .w, \"Lord of Doubles,\" the \"magical\" deity Heka thus presides over the dissemination of consecrated images, the transformation of a numinous primordial unity into a myriad of reflected forms. This \"ka-theology\"' 136 of which Heka is the patron begets the \"imagistic principle\" which is fundamental to all Egyptian theological speculation on the unity of creation: the 1132. Egyptian sacerdotal influence on Theurgy is clearest in lamblichus' De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum; for the text and translation, see lamblichus 1966. For Theurgy and its distinction from Greco-Roman magia and yorfotE, see now Luck 1985, pp. 20-23. The Egyptian priestly role in contemporary Theurgy is further illustrated in the \"Life of Plotinus\" (Luck ibid., pp. 218-19). 1133. As coined te Velde 1970, p. 176. 1134. See van Gennep 1960, p. 13: \"... religion, whose techniques (ceremonies, rites, services) I call magic.\" 1135. For Heka as the consecrator of the kas of the creator, the Lord of kas with a \"myriad of ka-spirits\" in his mouth, see CT spells 261 and 648, discussed above, pp. 17 and 23-25. 1136. For the \"ka-theology\" of creation, Greven 1952, especially pp. 35-41 and Schweitzer 1956.247 oi.uchicago.eduTHE MECHANICS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MAGICAL PRACTICE profusion of deities in the pantheon may be seen as \"images\" or projections of \"one god who made himself into millions,\"1 137 animals are the images of both gods and demons,1138 statues and reliefs are animated images of deity,1139 the king is both the bodily heir of the creator and his \"Living Image\" on earth,1140 priests conduct the cultic liturgy throughout 1137. Evidence from the Old Kingdom reveals that the root meaning of the basic Egyptian word for god is simply \"image\" (Spiegelberg 1930, pp. 120-21). This unity and equality of \"the One and the Many\" renders the question of \"monotheism versus polytheism\" irrelevant to Egyptian thought, a dichotomy as alien as that of \"magic versus religion.\" The ultimate unity of the creator and his creation (whether gods, men, animals, etc.) is expressed succinctly in such divine epithets as \"the one god who made himself into millions\" (ntr w' ir sw m ihh), attested from the New Kingdom through the Greco-Roman eras; see the discussion and examples in 188/7: \"who came into being alone, who begot himself as millions\"); and idem 1975, pp. 244 and 566 (no. 105/4 = idem 1983, pp. and 293/1 (no. 129); adding Wb Beleg. 3, p. 43 to Wb 3: 153/12: \"who came as one that he might differentiate himself as millions,\" \"who made himself into millions of gods, created from his limbs.\" Compare also Griffith and Thompson 1904, p. 67 (col. 9/6): \"Every god is your name.\" See also the \"pantheistic figures\" of divine emissaries discussed in Sauneron 1960 and Ritner 1989b, pp. 111-12. 1138. The function of sacred animals as images of an indwelling god are well known. Thus the \"Buchis\" bull is literally the \"Embodied ba\" of Re (b:-htr-h.t); for this ancient etymology of the name, see Fairman 1934, pp. 38-40. For the lion as the image of the king, see above, n. 573. For wild animals in ritual hunting and sacrifice as images of enemies and demons, see above, p. 160 and n. 743. The process is stated succinctly in Pap. Insinger, col. 24/8: \"Even the small scarab (is great) through its secret image\" ([as the sun god Khepri] Lichtheim 1980, p. 204). 1139. See Hornung 1973. Morenz's sharp distinction between the deity and images of the deity (1973, pp. 318-19, n. 71) reflects modern preoccupation with the category of \"idolatry\" (the worship of \"empty statues\"), a concept irrelevant to Egyptian notions of consecrated images. 1140. For the divine birth of the king and the role of Heka within it, see above, n. 110. The king as image of Horus is well known and codified in the royal \"Horus name\" (Gardiner 1973, p. 72). For the reigning monarch's affiliation with the archetypal \"royal ka,\" see L. Bell 1985. The king as \"living image\" is concretely expressed in the royal name \"The Living Image of Amon\" borne not only by Tutankhamun (Twt- 'n- 'lmn), but virtually II (Sim- inh-'Irn for Ptolemies and XII; var. Snn- nh- Irn and Alexander I); see Gauthier 1916, pp. 245, 263, 275, See also the names \"Twin of the Living Apis on their Birth-brick\" (for Ptolemy VI, ibid., p. 288), \"Living oi.uchicago.eduFROM hk- TO 21K: QUESTIONS OF DEFINITION AND DECLINE Egypt as the image of the king1141 and the gods,'142 royal statues are embodiments of the king,1143 while private statues and tomb reliefs are animated images of the dead, who are themselves ultimately images of Osiris (as \"Osiris so-and-so\"), et cetera. Indistinguishable from this pattern of images is the \"magical\" use of figurines, reliefs, vessels, the dead, animals, plants, et cetera, in funerary cult, execration rite, and medical practice. Ritual acts are no less imagistic, rendering concrete (by encircling, superposition, burning, trampling, etc.) their intangible \"doubles\" (dominion, superiority, victory, etc.). The effectiveness of \"magical\" words and names must be understood within the same continuum, the pictorial character of the Egyptian script (with representational determinatives) adding a further bond between the written word and the object which it embodies.1144 If the force of hk > is to be understood primarily as the power of effective duplication or \"empowered images,\" then the techniques discussed within this study constitute \"magical mechanics\" in both the Western and Egyptian sense-though for very different reasons. The use of hk: could hardly be construed in Egyptian terms as \"activity outside the law of natural causality\" since hk) is itself the ultimate source of causality, the generative force of nature. It is the notion of hk, which unites the tenets of Egyptian religion to the techniques of Egyptian religion. An _ niw fpw 1141. Since the king was in theory the chief priest of each temple, he necessarily designated \"represen- tatives\" to enact his role in daily ritual. In light of the thorough methodology of \"designated images\" in Egyptian theology, it is possible that these \"royal substitutions\" should not be considered only polite fictions of convenience. Should some reflected aspect of royal divinity be attributed to the liturgical performer-at least during the performance of the rite? The \"royal\" attributes of the high priest Herihor are perhaps an elaborate development of such a notion. 1142. Compare the ritual \"Songs of Isis and Nephthys\" in Pap. Bremner-Rhind, performed by two pure virgins \"with the hair of their bodies removed, their heads adorned with wigs, tambourines in their hands, and the names 'Isis' and 'Nephthys' inscribed on their shoulders\" (col. 1/2-4 in Faulkner 1933, p. I and 1936, pp. 121-22). Comparable to the practice with execration figures, the application of the name (Isis, Nephthys) to the figure (priestess) effects the identity. Masks of Anubis and Bes were used for similar identifications during ritual (Murray 1935-38 and Wild 1963, pp. 78-81). The significance of such masking is distorted beyond reason in Wolinski 1986 and 1987; see above, n. 1037. Priestly impersonators of Anubis regularly appear in funerary styled simply 'Inpw, \"Anubis\" or de Cenival 1972b, pp. 18, 33, 34, and 57, n. 25. Compare also CT spells 513, 516, and 546. 1143. For this now much-discussed issue, see the seminal study of Habachi (1969). Compare also the remarks of Davies and Davies 1939, p. 155: \"the visit of the king and queen ... seems to be by proxy, if indeed statues in Egypt ought to be considered as ranking inferior to the actual person.\" I 144.
