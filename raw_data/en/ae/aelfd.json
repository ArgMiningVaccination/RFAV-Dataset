A video synopsis produced by the American Red Cross to highlight the realized impact can be found here: https://vimeo.com/206581123/72c76ad3dd o Ayer and co -authors developed a Hepatitis C treatment prioritization tool for use by state prison systems, details of which are provided in IV.B1.12 o Ayer and co -authors developed an online, publicly available Hepatitis C Elimination Tool, which aims to pr ovide guidance on how HCV elimination targets can be achieved in a given region or country and what is the cost of eliminating HCV: http://www.hepcelimtool.org/ o Ayer and co -authors developed a Medical Surplus Resource Allocation Tool, details of which are provided in IV.B1.6 G. SOCIETAL AND POLICY IMPACTS G1. Impact in Practice o Ayer and co -authors developed online, publicly available, interactive COVID -19 planning tools that have been used by State Departments of Public Health, State Senators Offices, and have been widely covered by media and accessed300 -1000 times daily since launch in March 2020: www.covid19sim.org o Ayer and co -authors developed an alternative blood collection model which was implemented by the American Red Cross. The implementation of the proposed solution resulted in an approximately 40 percent reduction in the per unit collection cost for cryoprecipitate, a blood product with a tight collection -to-processing time constraint. A video synopsis produced by the American Red Cross to highlight the realized impact can be found here: https://vimeo.com/206581123/72c76ad3dd o Ayer and co -authors published a study on the value -based pricing of lung cancer drugs, which provided additional evidence for the final disapproval decision of this drug in the UK.

Course Development Co-developed a new undergraduate course, ISyE 4803 - Health Systems Engineering: this course is intended for preparing undergraduate students for a professional career in healthcare industry. Healthcare is the largest industry, yet; ISyE did not have a healthcare -focused course in its undergraduate program. In this new course, students learn about the healthcare systems, various stakeholders, incentive misalignments, grand challenges, and potential applications of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research/ Analytics in healthcare. C2. Course Improvement Completely redesigned HS 6000 - Introduction to Healthcare Delivery (a core course for the MS HS program). In additio n to regular classroom teaching activities, the students are actively participating in real healthcare projects in collaborations with the Page 37 of 36 T. Ayer - C.V. medical organizations in Atlanta area (past collaborators include Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University Hospital , Shepherd Center, and Perkins Will). C3. Professional Development/Continuing Education Course Developer, organizer, and instructor for the short course on \"Clinical Applications of Artificial Neural Networks,\" Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM) An nual Meeting (intended audience: medical professionals such as medical doctors and health policy researchers).
