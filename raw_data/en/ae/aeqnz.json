Surgery on the contralateral breast is a once in a lifetime benefit only. *130 to 150 cc implant equates to a one -cup-size increase Augmentation mammoplasty is NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY to enlarge small b ut otherwise normal and symmetrical breasts, or to create symmetry between normal breasts.1 Augmentation mammoplasty revision is only MEDICALLY NECESSARY for complications of an initial surgery . If the initial surgery is not medically necessary, revision for complications is still covered.1 Reconstructive breast surgery may be considered MEDICALLY NECESSARY after a medically nece ssary mastectomy, accidental injury, or trauma. Medically necessary mastectomies are most typically done as treatment for cancer. Reconstruction may be performed by an implant -based approach or through the use of autologous tissue.1 Revision of a reconstructive breast surgery may be considered MEDICALLY NECESSARY if the original surger y met the above criteria for reconstruction and there was either a complication from the origina l surgery that needs correction, or 2 the original reconstruction is normally performed in stages , or the member has a diagnosis of breast cancer . Explantation of a silicone gel -filled breast implant may be considered MEDI CALLY NECESSARY in all cases for a documented implant rupture, infection, extrusion, Baker class IV contracture, or as an adjunct to surgical treatment of breast cancer. Explantation of a ruptured saline -filled breast implant may be considered MEDICALLY NECESSARY only in those individuals who had originally undergone breast implantation for reconstructive purposes. Otherwise, indications for the explantation of a saline -filled implant are similar to those of a silicone -filled implant (i.e., infection, extrusion, Baker class IV contracture, or surgical treatment of breast cancer). Explantation of a breast implant associated with a Baker class III contracture may be considered MEDICALLY NECESSARY only in those individuals who had originally undergone breast implantation for reconstructive purposes. Reconstructive breast surgery after explantation of an implant is considered MEDICALLY NECESSARY only in those individuals who had originally undergone breast implantation for reconstructive purposes. The following indications for explantation of implants are considered INVESTIGATIONAL Systemic symptoms, attribu ted to connective tissue diseases, autoimmune diseases Anxiety Baker class III contractures in individuals with implants for cosmetic purposes Rupture of a saline implant in individuals with implants for cosmetic purposes Pain not related to contractures Preventive explantation in asymptomatic individuals to reduce remote risk of anaplastic large cell lymphoma Preventive explantation in asymptomatic individuals to reduce remote risk of B cell lymphoma. Implant repositioning to reposition a displaced implant is NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY. 1 Nipple inversion correction is NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY .1 Mastopexy to correct sagging breasts is NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY .1 Breast Reconstruction after Mastectomy2 Reconstruction after mastectomy, breast conservation therapy and diagnostic deformity of the breast is considered MEDICALLY NECESSARY on the affected breast : When performed in connection with breast cancer, the evaluation of breast cancer, the evaluation of suspected breast cancer, or the prevention of breast cancer development in high risk individuals ; OR For prostheses and physical complications of all stage s of mastectomy, breast conservation therapy (BCT) or other diagnostic procedures causing deformity, including lymphedema treatment. o Physical complications of a staged mastectomy may include, but is not limited to, abdominal scar revision/release related to prior tissue needed for breast reconstruction. Reconstruction after mastectomy, breast conservation therapy and diagnostic deformity of the breast is considered MEDICALLY NECESSARY on the un -affected breast in order to create a symmetrical appearance. Tattooing of the areola as part of ni pple reconstruction following a covered mastectomy is considered MEDICALLY NECESSARY .

breast surgery is defined as a surgical procedure that is designed to r estore the normal appearance of the breast after surgery, accidental injury, or trauma. Breast reconstruction is distinguished from purely cosmetic procedures by the presence of a medical condition, e.g., breast cancer or trauma, which leads to the need fo r breast reconstruction. The most common indication for reconstructive breast surgery is a prior mastectomy; in fact, benefits for reconstructive breast surgery in these individuals are a mandated benefit in many states. In contrast, cosmetic breast surgery is defined as surgery designed to alter or enhance the appearance of a breast that has not undergone surgery, accidental injury, or trauma. Reduction mammaplasty is a common examp le of cosmetic breast surgery, but surgery to alter the appearance of a congenital abnormality of the breasts, such as tubular breasts, would also be considered cosmetic in nature. There is a broadening array of surgical approaches to breast reconstruction. The most common is insertion of a breast implant, either a silicone gel -filled or saline -filled prosthesis. The implant is either inserted immediately at the time of mastectomy (C PT code 19340) or sometime afterward in conjunction with the previous use of a tissue expander (19342, 19357). The breast may also be reconstructed using autologous tissues, such as a free flap (19364), a latissimus dorsi flap (19361), or more commonly (TRAM nipple tattooing (11920) may also be considered reconstructive breast surgery. Since the purpose of reconstructive breast surgery is to restore the normal appearance of the breast, on some occasions procedures are performed on the contralateral, normal breast to achieve symmetry, such as mastopexy (19316) and reduction mammaplasty (19318). These procedures fall into the category of reconstructive breast surgery only when performed in conjunction with a contralateral mastectomy for cancer with associated reconstruction. Except for medically necessary reduction mammaplasty, these procedures are considered cosmetic in other circumstances. The followin g policy describes different types of reconstructive breast surgery and reviews the evidence on efficacy for the different approaches. It also establishes criteria for the explantation of breast implants based on whether the original implant was cosmetic o r reconstructive in nature, and whether the implant is silicone gel -filled or saline -filled. Summary Breast reconstruction is intended for individuals undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer, or who have an injury or trauma to the breasts. For the gener al population of women undergoing mastectomy, the 9 evidence supports the conclusion that breast reconstruction improves psychosocial outcomes, such as anxiety, social functioning, and perception of body image. Thus, breast reconstruction may be considered medically necessary when reconstruction is needed as a result of breast cancer, injury, or trauma. Important clinical questions remain concerning the optimal timing of breast reconstruction in women undergoing radiotherapy and concerning which of the surgi cal approaches leads to better outcomes. For women undergoing radiotherapy following mastectomy, the evidence is not sufficient to determine whether immediate or delayed surgery is preferred. The evidence is also not sufficient to determine the comparative efficacy of different procedures. There is some evidence that an autologous tissue approach leads to better cosmetic outcomes in individuals receiving radiotherapy, but this is not from high -quality evidence and is not a consistent finding across studies. Breast implants can be used as part of breast reconstruction, or for cosmetic reasons. Local complications of breast implants are common and may lead to explantation. The medical necessity of implant explantation is dependent on the type of implant, the indication for removal, and the original indication for implantation. For asymptomatic individuals with breast implants without documented implant rupture, infection, extrusion, Baker contracture, or surgical treatment of breast cancer who receive prevent ive breast implant explantation to reduce remote risk of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), the evidence includes prospective and retrospective epidemiological cohort studies, case series, and systematic reviews. Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease -specific survival, morbid events, functional outcomes, health status measures, quality of life, treatment -related mortality, and treatment -related morbidity. Systematic reviews of epidemiological studies and government regulatory epidemiologic dat abases have evaluated the risk of breast implant -associated ALCL (BIA -ALCL). Estimates varied widely, with the highest incidence associated with textured implant products that are no longer marketed in the United States. The certainty of the evidence is li mited by insufficient follow -up duration to assess risk and lack of standardization of clinical outcome data collection. Additionally, there is no evidence evaluating whether removal of implants reduces ALCL risk, and there are known risks of explantation surgery. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. For individuals with breast implants without documented implant rupture, infection, extrusion, Baker contracture, or surgical treat ment of breast cancer who receive preventive breast implant explantation to reduce remote risk of B cell lymphoma, the evidence includes case reports. Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease -specific survival, morbid events, functional outcomes, he alth status measures, quality of life, treatment -related mortality, and treatment -related morbidity. Recent case reports and small case series (N=3 to 8 cases) have described B cell lymphomas occurring in individuals with breast implants. More data are nee ded to determine if breast implants are associated with an increased risk of B cell lymphoma. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Policy History Date Action 8/2023 Annual policy review. Policy clarified.
