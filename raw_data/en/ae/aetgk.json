Introductory experience preferred Claymont Court; Huyett Road, Charles Town, WV Barbara June Appelgren A Washington Family Home, National Register of Historic Places Energy psychotherapy is a growing field showing great promise in current neuropsychological research. It is the generic name for a variety of mind/body techniques. According to Chinese medicine these interventions restore homeostasis to the energy meridians while Western medicine would say they integrate emotions emanating from the more primitive parts of the brain. This is especially relevant when old traumas remain unaffected by talk therapy. Although several modern techniques were developed fifteen to twenty-five years ago, it is only recently that they have become generally known. This practicum will focus on learning them well enough to teach them to clients who have become discouraged by years of unproductive efforts. Presentation topics may include but not be limited to: How energy psychotherapy interfaces with talk therapy Adaptations and variations in applying basic methods Using EFT phrasing without tapping to reframe thinking patterns Links between meditation, acupuncture, hypnosis, affirmation, kinesthetic learning, prayer, and EFT What to do when there seems to be little or no response Incorporating the patient's sense of humor into set-up and reminder phrasing Finding related aspects and issues that underlie what the client presents Best resources to learn about research Why and how to keep your use of energy psychotherapy alive and well Participants will have time to practice, ask questions, and give feedback.
