It is imperative that the parents/guardians, student, school nurse, school nutrition services director, and other school staff work together and coordinate their efforts to provide a safe learning environment for students with life threatening food allergies. School nut rition service and school nurses must follow pertinent federal and state laws and regulations in regards to serving appropriate meals, administering medication, and developing medical plans of care fo r students with food allergies. Furthermore, school policies and procedures must be c onsistent with state laws and regulations and with the standards of nursing and medical practice. ORGANIZATION OF THIS GUIDE This guide is organized into four major sections so that the diverse group of intended users can easily access information and tools relevant to their needs and roles: SECTION 1: UNDERSTANDING THE DISEASE The first section of this guide provides national statistics, characteristics of an allergic reaction and anaphylaxis, and describes effective f ood allergy management practices. SECTION 2: ADDRESSING STUDENT NEEDS Section 2 presents food allergy management ro les and responsibilities for school personnel, parent/guardian, and student, as well as guidance on training of school staff and development of policies. The school personnel section includ es separate action sheets for: Principals School Nurses Teachers Counselors Coaches & Physical Education Instructors Food Service Managers & Lunchroom Staff Custodians Bus Drivers Parents/Guardians Students with Food Allergies SECTION 3: TOOLS FOR EFFECTIVE FOOD ALLERGY MANAGEMENT IN SCHOOLS This section includes useful sample s of key tools for effectively mana ging food allergies in schools: Dietary Accommodations Instructions and Form Sample Emergency Care Plan Template Sample Individualized Healthcare Plan Sample 504 for Student with Food Allergies SECTION 4: SCHOOL RESPONSIBILITES UNDER LAW 6 There are federal and state laws that address schools' responsibilities to student s with food allergies. These laws are outlined in Section 4 of this guide. APPENDICES are included to provide a useful glossary of key terms and a list of credible resources. 7 SSeeccttiioonn 11.. UUnnddeerrssttaannddiinngg tthhee DDiisseeaassee FOOD ALLERGIE Approximately 4% of school-aged ch ildren have food allergies (about 2. 2 million in the US), and it is generally believed that the preval ence of food allergy among childre n is increasing. One study showed that peanut and tree nut allergy tripled among children from 1 997 to 2008, and the CDC recently reported that food allergy among children increased 18% from 1997 to 2007. ALLERGIC REACTION CHARACTERISTICS . Allergic reactions to foods vary a nd can range from mild to severe, lif e- threatening reactions. Every food allergic reaction has the po ssibility of developing into a life-th reatening reaction a nd even with proper treatment can be fatal. A life-threat ening reaction can occur within minut es or hours after exposure to the allergen. Besides food, bee/in sect stings, as well as medications a nd latex, also have the potential of causing life-threatening reactions. The following eight foods cause 90% of the allergic reactions in the United States: E g g s S o y Fish (haddock, tuna, salmon, etc.) Shellfish (shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.) Milk Tree Nuts (Brazil nuts, hazelnut, walnut, etc.) P e a n u t s W h e a t During an allergic reaction to a sp ecific food, the immune system rec ognizes a specific food protein as a target. This initiates a sequence of events in the ce lls of the immune system resulting in the release of chemicals, such as histamine. Ingestion of the food a llergen is the principal ro ute of exposure leading to allergic reaction. The symptoms of a food-allergic reaction are specific to each individual. Even a trace amount of food can, in some instances, quickly lead to fatal reactions. Research indicates that exposure to food allergens by touch or inhala tion is unlikely to cause a life- threatening reaction. However, if chil dren touch the allergen and then pl ace their fingers in or near their nose or mouth, the allergen could become ingested and could cause a life- threatening reaction. Allergies can affect almost any part of the body and cause various symptoms. The most dangerous symptoms of anaphylaxis include, but are not limited to, breathing difficulties, a drop in blood pressure, or shock, which are potentially fatal. Common signs a nd symptoms of allergic/a naphylactic reactions may include: Change of voice/hoarseness Itching (of any part of body) Coughing Itchy, scratc hy lips, tongue, mouth, and/or throat Cyanotic (bluish) lips and mouth area Nausea/vomiting D i a r r h e a R e d , w a t e r y e y e s Difficulty breathing/shortne ss of breath Runny nose Difficulty swallowing Sense of doom Dizziness/change in mental status Stomach cramps/abdominal pain Fainting or loss of consciousness Swelling (of any part of body) Flushed, pale skin Throat tightness or closing Hives/rash (of any part of body) Wheezing 8 ANAPHYLAXIS When the symptoms are rapid in onset and severe, the medical diagnosis is anaphylaxis. With anaphylaxis there is always the risk of death. Death could be immediate or may happe n two to four hours later due to a late phase reaction. The most dangerous symptoms include breathing difficul ties and a drop in blood pressure leading to shock. The treatment for anaphylaxis is prompt administra tion of epinephrine, tran sport by emergency medical services (EMS) to the nearest hospital emergency depa rtment, even if symptoms have been resolved, and followed by an observation period of four hours. A si ngle dose from an epine phrine auto-injector may provide a 10-15 minute (or less) wi ndow of relief. A second dose of epinephrine may be required if symptoms do not lessen or if medi cal help does not arrive quickly. EFFECTIVE FOOD ALLERGY MANAGEMENT The goal of effective food allergy management is to reduce and/or eliminate potential reactions. The keys to meeting this goal are prevention, education, awareness, communication, and emergency response. Adults responsible for students with food allergies must be familiar with each student's individual medical plan of care. These plans contain the specific actions necessary to keep the student safe. All complaints from students with a food allergy are to be taken seriously. There are some general considerations for students with food allergies: Remember students with food allerg ies are children/teens, first and foremost. Do not ask them if it is acceptable to deviate from a ny of their individual plans. Be aware of signs of anxiety or bullying. Also, younger students are more likely to put their hands/items in their mouths and may require food-free or allergen-free classrooms. This may in clude everyone thoroughly cleaning their hands before entering the cla ssroom and after eating. Accidents are more likely to happen when there is an unplanned event, such as an unplanned celebration or an off-premises event like a field trip with food. It is essential that the student's medical plans of care are followed exactly. If a st aff member has any questions, he or she should ask the school nurse before allowing any change s. This also applies to changes that may not directly involve eating. E LEMENTS OF EFFECTIVE FOOD ALLERGY MANAGEMENT IN SCHOOLS Students with food allergies need su pportive environments to help them take care of their food allergy throughout the school day and at school functions. There are several key elements of effective food allergy management in school, including: Developing and implementing written medical pl ans of care that outline each student's food allergy management Following an individualized meal plan Planning for special school events Planning for disasters and emergencies Dealing with emotional and social issues 9 Each of these elements of effectiv e food allergy management in schools is explored in more detail in the remainder of this section. Students with food allergies are more likely to succeed in school when parents/guardians, school personnel, and healthcare pr oviders work collaboratively to ensure effective food allergy management. Prior to entry into school or for a student who is already in school, im mediately after the diagnosis of a food allergy, the parent/guardian should meet with th e school nurse assigned to the student's building to develop the appropriate me dical plans of care: Emergency Care Pl an (ECP) (also interchangeable with Food Allergy Action Plan, FAAP), Individualized Health Care Plan (IHP), 504 Service Plan, and Individualized Education Program (IEP) with a medical component. The school nurse, collaborating with the building principal, nutriti on service director, school physician, and parent/guardian, shall determine the best way to promote a multi-disciplinary approach to plan for the care of the student with a food allergy. In addition, the team may incl ude but is not limited to: Administrative representative Nutrition service staff Teachers and specialists (e.g.: art, music, science, computer, family and consumer Sciences) School counselor Coaches and physical education teachers Custodian Bus driver Local EMS Other learning support staff and aides based on the student's curriculum and activities Student with food allergy (if age appropriate). The multi-disciplinary team works to implement wr itten plans outlining each student's food allergy management. These written plans help students, their families, school staff, and the student's healthcare provider know what is expected of them in implem enting effective food allergy management. Important written plans for effective f ood allergy management include: Food Allergy Medica l Management Plan - This plan should be part of the Individualized Health Care Plan (IHP) and Emergency Care Plan (ECP). This plan is developed by a student's personal healthcare team and family. It outlines the prescribed healthcare regimen and should be signed by the student's board certified allerg ist, family physician, physician as sistant, or certif ied registered nurse practitioner. The Medical Ma nagement Plan may include info rmation such as the student's date of diagnosis, current health status, list of equipment and supplies, specific medical orders, and emergency contact information. Emergency Care Plan (ECP) - This plan is based on the info rmation provided in the student's Individualized Health Care Pl an and specifically describes how to recognize a food allergy Written Medical Plans of Care 10 emergency and what to do when signs or sympto ms of these conditions are observed. The school nurse usually coordinates the development of the Emergency Plan and the plan should be distributed to all school personnel who have responsibility for the student. Individualized Health Care Plan (IHP ) - This plan is required by profe ssional standards of nursing practice and uses the nur sing process (assessment, dia gnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation) to determine a plan of action th at meets the healthcare needs of a student during the school day. This plan, initiated by the Certif ied School Nurse, provides written directions for school health personnel to follow in meeting the individual student's he althcare needs. While parental/guardian involvement is not required, it is str ongly encouraged. 504 Service Agreement - This plan outlines what medical accommodations, educational aids, and services a student with food allergies may need in order to have equal access to educational opportunities as students without food allergies. The term \"504 Service Agreement\" is used to refer to a plan of services developed under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Individualized Education Program (IEP) with a medical component - This plan is required for students who receive special educat ion and related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990. See Section 4 of this guide for more information on these and other federal and state laws related to school responsibilitie s. Education plans vary based on each student's unique needs, but pl ans for students with food allerg ies usually include the following components: o Identity of licensed school nurses and school staff who are trained to administer epinephrine auto-injectors o Location of the student's food allergy management supplies o Nutritional needs, including pr ovisions for meals and snacks o Plans to enable full participation in all school-sponsored activ ities and field trips o Maintenance of confidentiality and the student's right to privacy Individualized Transportation Plan (ITP) - This plan provides a standardized approach to identify accommodations needed for student s while traveling to and from school. The information in a student's Individualized Health Care Plan can be used in developing a Section 504 Plan or Individual Education Plan (IEP). The Indivi dualized Health Care Plan is not required by federal law, but it can be useful in addres sing the requirements of federal la ws related to scho ol responsibilities for children with food allergies. Th e Food Allergy Medical Management Pl an is not a substitute for the education plans required under federal law. See Section 3 of this guide for samples of Emergency Care Plan (ECP), 504 Service Agreement, and Individualized Health Care Plan (IHP). Accommodating Students with Disabling Special Dietary Needs - Schools participating in a federal Child Nutrition Program (School Lunc h, School Breakfast, or After School Snack Program) are required to make accommodations fo r students who are unable to eat the school meals because of a disability * that restricts their diet. In order to make modifications or Individualized Meal Plan 11 substitutions to the school meal, schools must have a written Medical Stat ement on file that is signed by a licensed physician. The statement must identify: The student's special dietary disability An explanation of why the disabili ty restricts the student's diet The major life activity(ies) affected by the disability The food(s) to be omitted from the student's diet The food or choice of foods that must be provided as the substitute *Only a physician can declare if a student has a disability. Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, a \"person with a disability\" means any person w ho has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities, ha s a record of such an impairment , or is regarded as having such an impairment. The term \"physical or mental impairment\" includes many diseases and conditions including food anaphylaxis or severe food allergy. Accommodating Students with Non-Disabling Special Dietary Needs - Schools may, at their discretion, make substitutions for students who ha ve a special dietary need, but do not meet the definition of disability. Examples include food in tolerances or allergies that do not cause life- threatening reactions. The decision to accommod ate a student's special dietary need can be determined on a case-by-case basis; however, the school should remain consistent with accommodating special dietary needs. In order to make modifications or substitutions to the school meal, schools must have a written medi cal statement signed by a recognized medical authority** identifying the following: An identification of the medical or other special dietary condition which restricts the student's diet The food or foods to be omitted from the student's diet The food or choice of foods to be substituted **In Pennsylvania, a recognized me dical authority includes a physic ian, physician assistant, and nurse practitioner. The USDA manual \"Accommodating students with Sp ecial Dietary needs in the School Nutrition Programs\" can be accessed at http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/gui dance/special_dietary_needs.pdf . Effectively meeting the needs of students with food allergies requires advance pl anning for special events such as classroom parties, field tr ips, and school-sponsored ex tracurricular activities held before or after school. With proper planning, students with food alle rgies can participate fu lly in all school-related activities without the pres ence of a parent/guardian. Parents/guardians of students with food allergies should be given advanc e notice of parties and events so they can decide whether their student should be give n the same food as other st udents or food the parent will provide. Schools are encouraged to provide guid elines for parties which include non-food prizes. Students often view a field trip as one of the most interesting, exciting activities of the school year and students with food allergies must be allowe d to have these school -related experiences. Special School Events 12 Students' education plans should carefully describe the plan fo r coverage and care during school- sponsored activities which take place while under school jurisdiction during or out side of school hours. Parents/guardians must provide the school with an emergency supply kit so schools are prepared to care for students with food allergies in the event of natural disasters or emergencies. The emergency supply kit should contain enough supplies for 72 hours. The emotional, as well as the physical needs of the student must be respected. A student's behavior may be drastically altered by th eir fears of a reaction. School social workers or guida nce counselors should be available to work with families with food-allergic students. Students w ith food allergies are \"at-risk\" for eating disorders and/or bullying. For example, a st udent may choose not to eat rather than risk embarrassment of a reacti on in front of a peer. Students with food allergies must d eal with the usual developmental i ssues of growing up, in addition to learning to manage their complex disease. Students re act differently to having food allergies. They may be accepting, resentful, open to discussing it, or eage r to hide it. Often, the same student will experience all of these feelings over time. For the most part, students do not want to be singled out or made to feel different from their peers. Food a llergy care tasks can set them apart and make them feel angry or resentful about their disease. Sc hool personnel should be aware of th e student's feelings about having food allergies and identify ways to ensure that the student is treated the same as others. Food allergies can also be a focal point for conflict within families. One of the biggest tasks for children and adolescents is to become increasingly independe nt from their parents/gua rdians. However, food allergies may compromise independence because pare nts/guardians are concerned about their student's ability to perform self-care and take responsibil ity for it. Parents/guard ians, who are ultimately responsible for their student's well-being, may be relu ctant to allow normal inde pendence in children or teens who have not been able to take care of them selves properly. This parent al concern can lead to increasing struggles with dependence, oppositional behavior, and rebellion. Healthcare providers and school personnel must be aware of emotional and behavioral issues related to food allergy care and management, a nd refer students and their families for counseling and support as needed . Disasters and Emer gencies Emotional and Social Concerns 13 SSeeccttiioonn 22:: AAddddrreessssiinngg SSttuuddeenntt NNeeeeddss This section of the Guide presents the role s and responsibilities of individual school personnel, parents/guardians, and students with food allergies in ma naging life-threatening food allergies. The action sheets included in th is section are useful tools to help ensure effective food allergy management in schools. The Pennsyl vania Departments of Education and Health encourage the copying and distribution of thes e actions sheets to school staff members, parents/guardians and student s with food allergies. 14 Actions and Considerations for Administra tors on Development of School Policy Develop policies/procedures to minimize potential life-threateni ng reactions in all classrooms, nutrition services/cafeterias, cla ssroom projects, crafts, outdoor act ivity areas, on school buses, during field trips, before-school and after-school act ivities, and in all instructional areas. Recommend that policies be system-wide. Require the development of appropriate medical plans of care, including an Emergency Care Plan (ECP) and Individualized Health Care Plan (IHP), for every student with a life threatening allergy. Consider, with school physician and school nur se, standing orders/pro tocols for licensed medical personnel to administer epinephrine au to-injectors to individu als with previously undiagnosed allergies. Avoid the use of food products as displays or components of disp lays in hallways. School options include establis hing allergen-free zones, such as a student's individual classroom, allergen-free lunch tabl e(s) or areas in the cafeteria, and food-free zones, such as libraries and music rooms. Student's classroom(s) must be a sa fe place for all students to learn. Develop letter for parents/guard ians of classmates and substitute teachers. (See samples in Appendix F). Permission to share this c onfidential information shoul d be obtained from the parent/guardian of the student with food allergies before sending letter. Letter should be written on school stati onery from the administration, school nurse, or teacher. Consider limiting the presence of animals in school buildings. Enforce policies requiring stude nts and staff to wash hands before and after eating. Field Trips/Transportation in School Vehicles Establish field trip policy: Include notification of school nurse in timely manner. Provision of Emergency Care Plan (ECP ) and epinephrine auto-injector to responsible personnel. Include location of closest medical facility and 9-1-1 procedures. Determine if local ambulance carries epinephrine and have staff trained to administer. Train appropriate staff in administra tion of epinephrine auto-injectors. Determination that location of field trip is safe for student with life-threatening allergies. Consider ways for students to wash hands before and after eating (e.g. provision of hand wipes, etc.) Invite parent of student with life-th reatening allergy to accompany student. Consider sending a nurse on the field trip. If meals are being packed by the school or brought by students: Avoid meals that may be food allergy related. Package meals appropriately to avoid cross-contamination. Enforce policies prohibiting eati ng on school transportation. Consider special seating arrangements for student. Provide system of communication shoul d an anaphylactic reaction occur. 15 Adapt curriculum, awards, rewards, or prizes by substituting allergen-free f ood or non-food item(s) in rooms where students having an Emergency Care Plan (ECP) may be present. Many schools have opted to completely remove f ood from the curriculum due to the number of students with food allergies and the variety of food allergies present within a school or classroom. Constructive Classroom Rewards: http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/c onstructive_classroom_rewards.pdf Limit food related to fundraising, birthday celebra tions, PTA functions to cafeteria, or other designated areas. Incorporate non-allergenic foods or non-food items. See Constructive Classroom Rewards above. Establish and communicate cleaning procedures for common areas (i.e., libraries, computer labs, buses, music, art room and ha llways, etc.). (Appendix C) Develop protocols for appropriate cleaning methods following even ts held at the school that involve food. (Appendix C) Determine, in conjunction with the Certified School Nurse, who should be familiar with the student's medical plans of care. Modify the school's emergency response plan to include procedures for managing life-threatening allergic reactions. Consider development of an emergency response team for each school building: Administration First Aid: School personnel tr ained in first aid procedures , including administration of epinephrine auto-injectors. Communication: School personnel responsible for maintaining communication between scene and office. Crowd control: School personnel responsible for directing ambulance crew to the scene and managing other students/school personnel. Develop emergency pr ocedures including: Assess emergency at hand and activate emergenc y response team (including the school nurse and administration). Administer the epinephrine auto-injector. Notify Emergency Medical Services. Notify the parent/guardians. Notify student's primary care provi der and/or allergy specialist. Manage crowd control. NOTE: Some of these steps will need to be performed simultaneously. Develop protocols for student's re-entry to school following a life-threatening allergic reaction. Provide emergency communication devices (two -way radio, intercom, walkie-talkie, cell phone) for all school acti vities, including transportation th at involve a student with food allergies. Ensure contingency plans are in place to continue care of the student in case of a substitute nurse, teacher, or nutri tion service personnel. Ensure contingency plans are in plac e when there is no nurse available. Educate all school personnel on life-threatening allergic conditions and the school's procedure for managing a life-threatening allergic reaction. (See more detail in next section). Train school personnel on the administration of ep inephrine auto-injectors. (See more detail in next section). Include local Emergency Manage ment Services in planning. Determine if local ambulance has epinephrine au to-injectors available a nd staff with approval to administer. 16 Determine unlocked location where epinephrine auto-injectors will be stored for quick response and accessibility, if not carried by student. Adhere to Occupational Safety and Health Ad ministration (OSHA) and Universal Precaution Guidelines for disposal of epinephrine auto-injectors after use. Ensure school district policy includes authorizat ion for students to self-carry and administer epinephrine auto-injectors. Arrange the schedule to allow for a fulltime nurse in every school bu ilding where a student with food allergies attends. Consider assigning the student to a classroom wh ere the teacher is trained to administer an epinephrine auto-injector and/or ensure assigned t eacher is trained to administer epinephrine auto- injector. In the event of a fatal allergic reaction: Implement the school's crisis pl an for the death of a student. In addition to counselors to assist staff and st udents, consider providing adults with knowledge of food allergies to answer questions. Resources on dealing with the deat h of a student ar e available at: The Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN), 17 Actions and Resources for Develo ping Training for School Staff Ensure training for nutrition service personne l and school health staff is provided. Include substitute teachers, nurses, and nutri tion service personnel in training opportunities. Teach all faculty and staff about the signs and symptoms of possible anaphylaxis. This training should include: How to recognize symptoms of an allergic reaction. Review of high-risk areas. Steps to take to preven t exposure to allergens. How to respond to an emergency. Recognize a life-threatening reaction and activ ate emergency medical services (Call 9- 1-1). Activate building emergency response team. Talk reassuringly to the student and keep them informed. How to respond to a student with a known alle rgy as well as a student with previously unknown allergy. Train school personnel on the administra tion of epinephrine auto-injectors. Encourage all school personnel to volunteer for this training. Consider having school staff trai ned as instructors for the Am erican Heart Association or American Red Cross and use their training modules. Recommend an annual skills check. Determine location of list of trai ned personnel for quick response. Conduct a medical emergency respon se drill twice a year. The recommended interval is at the beginning of school year and just after mid-year break.

To register as a user or to access your account for available courses, go to www.paprepared.net . 18 Actions for Principals Participate in developing and implementing school policy related to food allergy management at school. Ensure sufficient allocation of re sources to manage students with food allergies in your school. Ensure the development and implementation of a system that keeps schoo l health and nutrition services informed of the pending enrollment of students with food a llergies and any related enrollment changes that may occur throughout the school year. Promote a supportive learning environment for student s with food allergies. Treat these students the same as other students, except to be responsive to medical needs as outlined in the student's written medical plans of care. Identify all staff members who have respons ibility for students with food allergies. Meet at least annually with the school hea lth team. Arrange and attend a meeting of the school health team members (student, family, school nurse, 504/IEP coordinator, teacher(s), and other staff members who have primary responsibility for the stude nt) before the school year starts, or when the child is newly diagnosed, to disc uss medical accommodations, educatio nal aids, and services related to the student's needs. Support food allergy management training for the school nurse and other staff re sponsible for students with food allergies. Alert all school-related staff members who teach or supervise a student with food allergies. Ensure that they, including the bus driver and coaches, ar e familiar with the accommodations and emergency procedures outlined in the student's medical plans of care. Alert all substitute personnel. Ensure that they are aware of the needs and emergency procedures for students with food allergies. Respect the student's confidentiality and right to privacy. Help establish on-campus and off-campus emergency protocols. Facilitate and support ongoing co mmunication between parents/guard ians of students with food allergies and school staff. Learn about food allergy management by reviewing th e information and resources presented in this guide. Be able to recognize and support resp onse to signs and symptoms of a life threatening allergic reaction in accordance with the student's written emergency plans. This includes knowing when and how to contact the school nurse. Understand the federal and state laws that apply to students with food allergies. See Section 4 of this guide for more information. 19 Actions for School Nurses School nurses coordinate the provisi on of healthcare services for a stude nt with food allergies at school and at school-related ac tivities. When notified that a student with food allergies is enrolled in the school, annually, or more often as necessary, the school nurse: Initiates the appropriate medical plans of care (IHP, 504 Service Plan, or IEP with a medical component). Encourage parent/guardian involvemen t in the development of these plans, where appropriate. The plan shall include: Student name Specific offending allergens Warning signs of reactions Emergency treatment Name of persons/positions trained in administering the epinephrine auto-injector Establish contingency plan should st udent be unable to self-administer or primary person is absent Where the medication is stor ed (or carried by student) Procedure to monitor the expiration date Risk reduction and emergency response at the following times: Travel to and from school School day Before and after school programs Field trips Emergency situations (e.g. evacuatio ns, lockdowns or shelter-in-place) Initiates an Emergency Care Plan (ECP) for all identified students. Should be with the student at all times as well as appropriate adults. The plan shall include (see above) Should be signed by the Certified School Nurse. See Section 3 of this docum ent for a sample ECP. Determine competency for student to carry and self-administer epinephrine auto-injector. Following a moderate to severe reaction: Obtain as much accurate information as po ssible about the allergic reaction, including those who witnessed the event and th ose who provided medical intervention. Meet with parents/guardians and st udent to discuss event and concerns. Discuss student's feelings about returning to school. Check in with student on a daily basis to alleviate anxiety. If an anxiety response is prolonged, colla borate with parents/guardians and the student's medical provider to determine interventions. Consider possible referral to Student Assistance Team. Meet with school staff to discuss the event and dispel any rumors. Provide factual information. This may be discussed with the parent/gua rdian, but information that does not identify the student may be shared with the sc hool community without parental/guardian permission (e.g., a letter from the prin cipal to parents and teachers). Information provided to student s shall be age appropriate. 20 If the reaction is thought to be from a food provided by the school, request assistance of the Nutrition Service Director to ascertain what potential food item was served/consumed. Review food labels with Nutrit ion Service Director and staff. Review the student's medical plan s of care and amend as necessary. Facilitate the initial scho ol health team meeting to discuss the implementation of the IHP and participate in the development of the student's education plan . The school nurse will help monitor compliance with these plans and facilita te follow-up meetings of the school health team to discuss concerns, receive updates, and evaluate the need for changes to the student's plan. Obtain materials and medical supplies necessa ry from the parent/guardian and arrange a system for notifying the student or parents/guard ian when supplies need to be replenished. Provide food allergy education resources for the student, family, and school staff, which can include sharing and reviewing sect ions of this guide. Help en sure that individuals mentioned in education plans know their roles in suppor ting food allergy management and know when and where to seek help. School Nurses can cont act the Department of Health for information. Participate in food allergy management trai ning provided by healthcar e professionals and organizations with expertise in food allergies to attain or enhance knowledge about current standards of care. Practice universal precautions and infecti on control procedures during all student encounters. Maintain accurate documentation of contacts with the student and family members, communications with the student's healthcare pr ovider, and any direct care given, including medication administration. Collaborate with other school personnel and part ner agencies, such as food service staff or school transportation services, to support food allergy management, as necessary. With parental permission, act as a liaison be tween the school and the student's healthcare provider regarding the student's se lf management at school. Communicate to parents/guard ian any concerns about th e student's food allergy. Promote and encourage independence and self-care consistent with the student's ability, skill, maturity, and developm ental level. Respect the student's confidentiality and right to privacy. Act as an advocate for students to help them meet their food allergy healthcare needs. Assist the classroom teacher with developing a plan for substitute teachers to meet student needs according to care plans. Be knowledgeable about federal, state, and lo cal laws and regulations that pertain to managing food allergie s at school. 21 The Pennsylvania Public School Code (PSC) of 1949 defines a school nurse as a licensed registered nurse who is properly certificated by the Pennsylvania Department of Education as a school nurse and who is employed by a school district or joint school board as a school nurse, or is employed in providing school nurse services to children of school age by a county health unit or department or board of health in any municipality with which a school district or joint school board has contracted for school health services pursuant to the provisions of 1411 of PSC. Under the Pennsylvania Nurse Practice Act , there is no provision for a registered nurse (RN) to delegate nursing tasks. However, according to the Pennsyl vania Department of State, Board of Nursing, RNs may train unl icensed individuals to assist with the administration of asthma inhalers and epine phrine auto-injectors. Supplemental licensed nurses who are not certified sc hool nurses must work under the direction of the school nurse and cannot be assigned a caseload. A licensed nurse must have an order for medi cations. Without an order, licensed nurses administering medication are di agnosing and prescribing treatm ent, which is outside of nursing practice parameters and is within the practice of medicine defined by the Medical Practice Act of 1985. See Section 4 of this guide for more informati on about state and federal laws related to the care of students with diabetes. 22 Actions for Teachers With approval from the parents/guardians of the st udent with life-threateni ng food allergies, notify parents/guardians of students in th e class that there is a student with a life-threatening food allergy and ways that the parent/guardians ca n help reduce the risk of exposure to an allergen. (See Appendix F: Sample letter for classmates and parents). Include a cut off portion for parents of classmates to return to the school as proof of receipt of the information. Coordinate with parents/guardia ns on providing a lesson plan about food allergies for the class and discuss anaphylaxis in age appropri ate terms, with student's permission. Educate classmates to avoid endangering, isol ating, stigmatizing, or harassing students with food allergies. Work with the school nurse to educate other pare nts/guardians about the presence and needs of the student with life-thr eatening allergies. Enlist their help in keepi ng certain foods out of the classroom. Determine special seating arrangements in the classroom, if necessary. Be aware of cleaning protocols and allowa ble cleaning solutions for the classroom. Receive the Emergency Care Plan (ECP) of any stude nts(s) in their classroo m with life-threatening allergies. Keep ECP with photo (if available) accessi ble in classroom or with lesson plan. Be sure volunteers, student teachers, aides, specialists, and substitute teachers, in the classroom throughout the school year, are info rmed of the student' s food allergies and necessary safeguards. Leave information in an organized, prominent, and accessible format for substitute teachers. Request that the classroom has a functioning intercom, walkie-talkie or other communication device for communication with the school nurse. Participate in a team meeting for the st udent and in-service training regarding: Allergens that cause life-thre atening reactions and accidental exposures to allergens. How to recognize symptoms of a lif e-threatening alle rgic reaction. Steps to manage an emergency. How to administer an epinephrine auto-injector. Be aware of how the student is being treated; enforce school ru les about bullying and threats. Inform parents/guardians of student(s) with life-t hreatening food allergy of any school events where food will be served. Consider having the parents/guardians provide classroom snacks for their student. These snacks should be kept in a separate snack box. If not covered by school policy, estab lish classroom rules to decrease the risk of exposure for the food allergy student. Teach all students proper hand-washing techniqu es and consider washing their hands before and after eating. Use non-food items for rewards instead of candy or other food. Consider a non-food treat for all parties/celebr ations. If food treats ar e provided, recommend they be pre-packaged and labeled to assist in identifying allergens. Prohibit sharing or tradi ng food in the classroom. Classroom animals can be problematic on many levels. If an animal is present in the classroom, special attention must be paid to th e ingredients in their food as many animal foods contain peanuts or ot her common allergens. Understand that classroom proj ect materials containing the allergen may not be used. 23 Never question or hesitate to act if a stude nt reports signs of an allergic reaction. Be able to recognize and support response to sign s and symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction in accordance with the student's writte n emergency plans. This includes knowing when and how to contact the school nurse. Provide a supportive environment for the student to manage food allerg ies effectively and safely at school. Provide classroom accommodations for the student with food allergies, as indicated in the student's medical plan of care. Notify the parents/guardian in advan ce of changes in the school schedu le, such as class parties, field trips, and other special events. Communicate with the school nurse or parent/guardian regarding a ny concerns about the student. Learn about food allergies by review ing the information and resources presented in this guide and discussing effective food allergy ma nagement with the school nurse. Respect the student's confidentiality and right to privacy. Treat the student with food allergie s the same as other students, ex cept to be responsive to medical needs as outlined in the stude nt's written care plans. Younger students are more likely to put their hand s and/or items in their mouths and may require food-free or allergen-free classrooms. Consider having everyone wash their hands before entering the classroom and after eating. All concerns from students with a food allergy are to be taken seriously. . 24 Actions for Counselors Work with school staff to promote a supportive learning environment. Help to ensure that students with food allergies are treated the same as other students, except to be responsive to medical needs as outlined in the studen t's written care plans. Provide input to the school h ealth team when requested. Communicate with the school nur se regarding any concerns about the student. Be aware and be prepared to respond to the emotional needs of the student. Students react differently to having food allergies. Some are accepting and ope n to discussing it; others are resentful and may attempt to hide it. Often, a single child will expe rience both kinds of feelings. Be aware of the student's feelings and identify ways to ensure th e student is treated the same as other students. Be aware that some students may not wish to shar e information about their food allergies with other students or school staff, partic ularly if it makes them feel different from others. Promote and encourage independence and self-care cons istent with the student's ability, skill, maturity and developmental level. Respect the student's confidentiality and right to privacy. Recognize that students with chronic illnesses may re bel by discontinuing all or part of their medical regimen. All concerns from students with a food allergy are to be taken seriously. 25 Actions for Custodians Ensure that cleaners are properl y labeled and storage areas for cleaning supplies are identified. Avoid cross-contamination of foods by wiping dow n eating surfaces with an appropriate cleaner before and after eating. (See Appendix C). Tables should also be washed with an appropriate cleaner in the morning if an after-school event has been held in the cafeteria the night before. Never question or hesitate to act if a stude nt reports signs of an allergic reaction. 26 Actions for Coaches, Phys ical Education Instructor s, Playground Staff and Other Onsite Persons in Charge of Co nducting After School Activities Participate in team meetings to discuss implementation of student's plans of care. Conduct the activities in accordance w ith all school policies and proce dures regarding life threatening allergies. Keep a copy of the Emergency Care Plan, including a photo of the student. Make certain that a emergency communication devi ce (e.g. walkie-talkie, in tercom, cell phone) is always available. Participate in training to admini ster epinephrine auto-injectors. At least one person should be pres ent at each activity who is trai ned in administration of this device. Know local Emergency Medi cal Services procedures. Identify the staff responsible for keeping the first aid kit. If for safety reasons, medical alert identificati on needs to be removed during specific activities, remind the student to replace this identificati on immediately after the activity is completed. Provide input to the student's sc hool health team as needed. Communicate with the school nur se regarding any concerns about the student. Provide information for substitute instructors that communicate the da ily needs of the student and the written emergency care plan. Respect the student's confidentiality & right to privacy. Treat the student with food allergie s the same as other students, ex cept to be responsive to medical needs as outlined in the stude nt's written care plans. All concerns from students with a food allergy are to be taken seriously. Be able to recognize and support response to sign s and symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction in accordance with the student's writte n emergency plans. This includes knowing when and how to contact the school nurse or EMS. Learn about food allergies by review ing the information and resources presented in this guide and discussing effective food allergy ma nagement with the school nurse. Younger students are more likely to put their hand s and/or items in their mouths and may require food-free or allergen-free classrooms. Consider having everyone wash their hands before entering the classroom and after eating. Coaches and after-school activities co ordinators should particularly be aware of field trip/off-school site procedures for outings and travel. 27 Actions for Food Service Managers and Lunchroom Staff Provide a representative for team meetings to discuss implementa tion of student's plans of care. Work with the school nurse in identifying students with life-thr eatening allergies. Obtain Medical Plan of Care form and maintain file in cafeteria office. Plan appropriate substitutions or modifications for meals served to students with life- threatening food allergies. If Point of Sale system is used, include allergy alerts and picture of the student. Post student's Emergency Care Pl an in readily accessible spot. Evaluate the need for special seating arrangements , such as an allergen-free table, zone, etc. Follow appropriate cleaning and sanitation techniques Avoid cross-contamination of foods by wiping down eating and preparat ion surfaces/utensils with an appropriate cleaner before, during and af ter preparation and eating. (See Appendix C). Common examples of cross-contamination: Lifting peanut butter cookies with a spat ula and then using the same spatula to lift sugar cookies. Using a knife to make peanut butter sandwiches, wiping the knife and then using the same knife to spread mustard on the cheese sandwich of a peanut allergic student. Tables should also be washed with an appropria te cleaner in the morning if an after-school event has been held in the cafeteria the night before. Wash preparation areas, work surface, utensils, pots and pans with hot soapy water. Soap denatures the protein th at causes the allergy. Consider using a color-coded cutting board system to minimize cross-contamination. Reinforce hand-washing before and afte r eating for all students and staff. Read all food labels and recheck r outinely for potentia l food allergens. Be prepared to discuss: menus (breakfast, lunch and after hool snack); a carte items; vending products and ingredients; food hand ling practices; cleaning and sanitation practices; and res ponsibility of various staff (or a dditional contract employees at individual schools). Prepared food ingredient lists used in f ood production and service. Be aware that the manufacturer may make substitutions to products without notification. Maintain food labels from each food served to a student with life-threatening food allergies for at least 24 hours following service in case of a dela yed anaphylactic reaction. See The Food and Allergy Anaphylaxis Network website for more information about reading food labels to avoid potential allergens at http://www.foodallergy.org/sec tion/shoppingselecting-safe-foods . Maintain contact information for manufacturers of food products (Consumer Hotline), vendors and purveyors. Ask specific questions. (e.g. Does your product include peanuts? Is there a risk of cross- contamination with peanuts in your food manufacturing process?) Establish and enforce procedures for sound food ha ndling practices to avoid cross-contamination, including frequent hand washing. Train cafeteria staff and monitors: Proper cleaning techniques a nd solutions (See Appendix C) for tables, chairs, and food preparation surfaces. Reading of product food labels a nd recognition of food allergens. 28 Read all food labels and recheck with each purchase for potential food allergens. (Manufacturers can change ingredients.) Establish procedures for sound food handling pr actices to avoid cross contamination with potential food allergens. Administration of epinephrine auto-injectors and recognition of life-threatening allergic reactions. Maintain at least two trained staff in the cafeteria during breakfas t and/or lunch hours. Never question or hesitate to act if a stude nt reports signs of an allergic reaction. Monitor students and intervene quickly to help prevent trading of food or bullying. Complete the School Nutrition Toolbox Trai ning on Special Dietary Needs available at http://nutr88.hhdev.psu.edu/smi/login/index.php . Field Trips If meals are being packed by the school: Avoid meals that may be food allergy related. Package meals appropriately to avoid cross-contamination. Make certain that a emergency communication devi ce (e.g. walkie-talkie, in tercom, cell phone) is always available. Never question or hesitate to act if a stude nt reports signs of an allergic reaction. Understand the laws protecting studen ts with life-threatening food allerg ies as they relate to nutrition services (See Section 4). Provide a lunch menu and lunch schedule in advan ce to parents/guardian a nd the school nurse who will be working with the student. Know where the supplies to treat an anaphylactic reac tion are kept (e.g., with th e student or in another place). Consider having a readily accessible ep inephrine auto-injector with a tr ained cafeteria staff member to administer, if necessary. Communicate with the school nurse any concerns about the student. Provide input to the student's sc hool health team as needed. Respect the student's confidentiality and right to privacy.

Provide training for all school bus drivers on ma naging food allergies (provide own training or contract with school). Provide functioning emergency communication device (e.g., cell phone, two-way radio, walkie-talkie) Know local Emergency Medi cal Services procedures. Maintain policy of no food eating allowed on school buses. Enforce special seating for student w ith food allergies, if applicable. Work with school personnel to complete an Indivi dualized Transportation Plan (ITP). See Section 3 for more information. At the beginning of the school year, work with sc hools to identify any studen t riders who have food allergies. Be aware of conflicts between students needing sn acks for other medical condi tions and students with food allergies. Approved snacks should be in the Em ergency Care Plan or Individualized Healthcare Plan. Obtain a copy of the student's written emergency pl an and keep it on the bus in a known, secure place. Leave the plan readily available for substitute bus drivers. Be able to recognize and support response to sign s and symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction in accordance with the student's writte n emergency plans.

Name and telephone number of the student's primary care provider and board certified allergist. Method to reach parents/guardians/designee shou ld an emergency occur (e.g., telephone, cell- phone, beeper). Update information as needed to maintain accurate information. Age-appropriate ways to include a student in planning for care and implementing the plan. Assessment for student to self-carry their prescr ibed epinephrine, along with their ability to potentially self-administer the medication (It is important that students take more responsibility for their food alle rgies as they grow older and are developmentally ready to accept responsibility.) If possible, participate in the training/orientation in the student's classroom. Participate in team meetings or communicate with all staff members who will be in contact with the child (preferably before the opening of school) to: Discuss implementation of medical plans of care. Establish prevention plan. Periodically (as needed) revi ew prevention and emergency action plans with the team. During the school year, the parents/guardians shall: Consider obtaining a medical alert bracelet for their student. Provide the school nurse with medicati on orders from the licensed provider. Discuss development of medical pl ans of care with the school nurse. Provide the school nurse with at least annual updates on thei r student's allergy status.

Provide the school nurse with medical documenta tion if the student no longer has allergies. Inform appropriate adults (volunteers, PTO, etc) about their student's food allergy during after school activities. NOTE: In orde r for the school to re lease medical information to \"appropriate adults\" who are not school employees, there must be a signed release from the parent/guardian. Consider having a bag of \"safe snacks\" in th eir student's classroom so there is always something their student can choose dur ing an unplanned special event. Consider providing a non-perishable lunch to ke ep in school, in case their student forgets lunch. Be willing to provide safe foods for special occa sions, e.g. bring in a treat for the entire class so their student can participate. 31 Be willing to go on field trips if possible and if requested. Teach and consistently remind their student to: Recognize the first symptoms of an allergic/anaphyl actic reaction. Communicate clearly as soon as they feel a reaction is starting. Carry his/her own epinephrine auto-injector wh en appropriate or know where the epinephrine auto-injector is kept and who has access. Not share snacks, lunches, or drinks.

In order to make modifications or substitutions to the school meal, schools must have a written Medical Statement on file that is signed by a licensed physician. The statement must identify: The child's disability An explanation of why the disability restricts the child's diet The major life activity affected by the disability The food(s) to be omitted from the child's diet The food or choice of foods that must be provided as the substitute *Only a physician can declare if a student has a disability. Accommodating Students with Non-Disabling Special Dietary Needs Schools may, at their discretion, make substitutions for st udents who have a special dietary need, but do not meet the definition of disability. Examples include food into lerances or allergies that do not cause life-threatening reactions. The decision to accommodate a student's sp ecial dietary need can be determined on a case-by-case basis, however, the school should remain consistent w ith accommodating special dietary needs. In order to make modifications or substitutions to the school meal, schools must have a written Medical Statement signed by a recognized medical authority identifying the following: An identification of the medical or other special dietary condition which restricts the child's diet The food or foods to be omitted from the child's diet The food or choice of foods to be substituted In Pennsylvania, a recognized medical authority includes a physician, physician assistant, and nurse practitioner. Milk Substitutions for Students with Non-Disabling Special Dietary Needs For students with non-disabling special dietary needs whic h restrict their intake of fluid milk, the following applies. Parents/guardians or a recognized medical author ity (physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner) may request a fluid milk substitute for a student with a non-disabling medical dietary need, such as milk intolerance, or due to cultural, religi ous or ethnic beliefs. The request must be made in writing. The written request from a parent/guardian or medical authority must identify the student's medical or special dietary need that prevents them from c onsuming cow's milk. Specifically referring to milk substitutions, a \"special dietary need\" can refer to cultu ral, ethnic, or religious needs, as well as medical needs. Nondairy beverages offered as a fluid milk substitute must meet the established nutrient standards, as indicated in Question 20 in USDA memo SP07-2010, available on PEARS Form Download, under Feeding Students with Disabilities and Special Dietary Needs Section. Juice and water cannot be substituted for fluid milk as part of the reimbursable meal even when requested by a physician. When fruit juice is merchandised as an option for a fruit/vegetable component, it can contribute up to 3/8 cup of the fruit/vegetable component. It cannot be offered in place of milk and it must be available to all students as an option. Responsibility of Parents Notify the school of any food allergy, disability or special dietary need. Provide Medical Statement complete d by a physician (disability), a recognized medical authority (non- disabling special dietary need), or the parent (non-disabling special dietary needs for milk only). Participate in any meetings or discussions regarding th e student's meal plan. Maintain a healthy line of communication with the school. Notify the school of any changes relating to the special dietary need (a new Medical Statement is required if the diet changes). 35 School Food Service Responsibility Provide food substitutions for students according to Me dical Statement. The school food service staff may not revise or change a diet prescription or medical order. Provide training to cafeteria personnel on how to properly accommodate students with special dietary needs. Maintain documentation of this training. Communicate with parents, staff, and medical authorities regarding diet modifications. Maintain Medical Statement on each student with a special dietary need. Diet orders are not required to be renewed on a yearly basis, however, PDE recommends that you confirm, on a yearly basis, the diet order has not changed. If there are any changes to the diet, a new Medical Statement is required. If the school is opting to make a milk substitute ava ilable for non-disabling dietary needs, research products to ensure they meet the USDA nutrient standards fo r a milk substitute. Notify the Division of Food and Nutrition if you are making milk substitutes available for non-disabling special needs. School Nurse Responsibility Collaborate with food service director, school staff, pare nts, and physician to appropriately share pertinent information, obtain a copy of Medical Statement, a nd accommodate students with special dietary needs. Develop medical plan of care as appropriate (Individualized Healthcare Plan). Other Federal regulations Based upon Federal laws that prohibit discrimination and ensure equal access to edu cation, some students may have instructions for accommodating their special need wr itten into a 504 Plan or an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). Typically, a team consisting of the school professionals and the parents collaborate to develop these plans. If the 504 Plan or IEP involves special diet ary needs, the food service director should be involved.

USDA regulations 7CFR Part 15B require substitutions or modifications in school program meals for children whose disability restricts their diet and is sup ported by a statement signed by a licensed physician . Food allergies which may result in a severe, life-threatening (anaphylactic) reac tion may meet the definiti on of \"disability.\" The school may choose to accommodate a student with a non-disabling special dietary need that is supported by a statement signed by a recognized medical authority (physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner). The school food authority may choose to make a milk substitution available for students with a non-disabling special dietary need , such as milk intolerance or for cultural or reli gious beliefs. If the school food authority makes these substitutions available, the milk substitute must meet nutrien t standards identified in regulations. If available, this will b e indicated in Part 2. A parent/guardian or recognized medical authority (physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner) may complete this section. If this is the only substitution being requested, complete Part 1 and 2 only.

While the students are in the custody of the school, the school has the re sponsibility to keep them safe. Since food allergies are potentially deadly, the consequen ces of a school's neg ligence in protecting a food-allergic student coul d result in legal and fina ncial liability, including personal injury lawsuits brought by harmed students or their families. For that reason, a good food allergy pl an is not only in the best interest of the food allergic student, it is in the best inte rest of the sch ool district. Certain federal laws govern the scho ol district's responsibilities for meeting the needs of students with severe food allergies and other forms of anaphylaxis. These guidelines are in addition to, and not in lieu of, those federal laws. The school district has an obligation to seek suitable means of reasonably accommodating a student upon notification and confirmati on of potentially life-thre atening food allergies and to keep a record indicating that the school conscientiously carried out this obligation. Included in this duty, is an obligation to gather sufficient information from the food allergic stud ent and qualified experts, as needed, to determine what accommodations are necessary. Based upon federal laws that prohibit discrimination and ensure equal access to education, the best practice is for all students with f ood allergies to have an individuali zed Emergency Care Plan (ECP) or Allergy Action Plan in place. A medical plan of car e, such as an Individualized Health Care Plan, Individualized Education Plan (IEP) with a medical component, and/or 504 Service Plan must contain an ECP. Regardless of the type of me dical plan of care the student ha s, schools can provide valuable resources to students with food alle rgies and their families by helping students feel accepted within the school community. Typically, a team consisting of the school professionals and th e parents collaborate to develop these plans. When the medical plan of care i nvolves special dietary needs, such as food allergies, the nutrition services dir ector should be involved. See Section 3 for more informa tion on medical plans of care. Federal Laws . SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973 (SECTION 504) Section 504 prohibits recipients of federal funds from discriminating against people on the basis of disability. A student with a disability under Section 504 is defined as one who has a physical or mental health impairment (in this case, life-threatening anaphylaxis) that \"substantially limits a major \u00a7794; 34 C.F.R. \u00a7104, et seq.). Major life activities covered by this definition include, but are not limited to, cari ng for one's self, pe rforming manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, r eading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working. Major life activities also include the operation of major bodily functions, including, but not limited t o, functions of the immune system , normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brai n, respiratory, circulat ory, endocrine, and repr oductive functions. Food allergies may affect multiple majo r life activities and bodily functi ons. \"Substantially limited\" is not 50 defined in Section 504 regulations. In order to determin e eligibility criteria, as outlined in the regulations, an individual assessment of the student is required. Section 504 outlines a process for school s to use in determining whether a student has a disability and in determining what services a student with a disability needs. This evaluation process must be tailored individually, since each student is different and his or her needs will vary. Historically, students with life- threatening food allergies have been covered by Secti on 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (see below). Under Section 504, students with disabilities must be given an equal opport unity to participate in academic, nonacademic, and extracurricular activities. Th e regulations also requi re school districts to identify all students with disabi lities and to provide them with a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Under Section 504, FAPE is th e provision of regular or specia l education and related aids and services designed to meet the indivi dual educational needs of students w ith disabilities as adequately as the needs of nondisabled students are met. These services should occur within the student's usual school setting with as little disruption as possible to the school and student's routines. The FAPE standard is generally satisfied by following the U.S. Department of Education's implementing regulations for the Individuals with Disabilities E ducation Act (IDEA), which refer to \"handicapped persons. (See IDEA discussion below). However, a student does not have to receive special education services in order to receive related aids and services under Section 504. Admini stering an epinephrine auto-inj ector and providing assistance in reducing exposure to allergens are two examples of re lated aids and services that schools may have to provide for a particular student wi th life threatening food allergies. The most common practice is to include these related aids and serv ices, as well as any needed special education servi ces, in a written document, sometimes called a \"Section 504 Plan.\" Private schools that receive federal funds may not exclude an individual student with a disability if the school can, with minor adjustments, provide an appropriate education to that student. T ITLE II OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990 (ADA) Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimi nation on the basis of disability by public entities, regardless of whether the public enti ties receive federal funds. P ublic school districts that receive federal funds are covered by both Title II and Section 504, and the obligations of public schools to students with disabilities under each law are generally the same. The ADA also provides a definition of \"substantially limits\" (42 U.S.C. \u00a712101 et seq.; 29 C.F.R. \u00a71 630 et seq.) For schools, these laws are enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in the U.S. Department of Education. THE AMERICAN WITH DISABILITIES ACT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 (ADAAA) The ADAAA made significant change s to the ADA's definition of disa bility by broadening the scope of coverage (i.e., broadening what qualif ies as a \"disability\") and limiting consideration of the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures (i.e., medication or learned behavioral modifi cations). The ADAAA also overturned a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions that interpreted the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 in a way that made it difficult to prove that impairments were a disability. On September 23, 2009, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commi ssion (\"EEOC\") published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"NPRM\") to conform its current A DA regulations to include the ADAAA amendments. The latest information about the NPRM to the ADA regulations is available at: www.eeoc.gov/ada/amendments_notice.html. The EEOC ha s stated that it may i mmediately begin using the positions set forth in its proposed regulations for its litigation and enforcement proceedings because it 51 views ADAAA as restorative of the original broad pr otection of the ADA. These amendments to the ADA make it easier for a person with severe food alle rgies to qualify for pr otection under the ADA. (Pub. L. No. 110-325) I NDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT (IDEA) IDEA provides federal funds to assist state educa tional agencies and, through them, local educational agencies in making special education and related services available to eligible children with disabilities. A qualifying disability under Part B of IDEA is different than the term disability under Section 504. Under IDEA, a student with a disability means: 1) the student was evaluate d in accordance with IDEA, 2) has one or more of the recognized 13 disability categori es, and 3) because of the qualifying disability, needs special education and related servi ces. IDEA is administered by the O ffice of Special Education Programs (OSEP) in the Office of Special Education and Rehabi litative Services (OSERS) in the U.S. Department of Education. IDEA is different from the ADA and Section 504 because it rela tes to the accommodations a school must make in the individuali zed education and curriculum of a st udent with a disability, not just the ability of the student to attend school classes and activ ities with other students. IDEA requires school districts to fi nd and identify children with disabilities and to provide them a free, appropriate public education (FAPE). Under IDEA, FA PE means special education and related services that meet state standards and are provided in confor mity with an individualized education program (IEP). An IEP is a written plan for a stude nt with a disability that that is developed, reviewed, and revised in accordance with the IDEA and the U.S. Department of Education's implementi ng regulations. Typically, students with food allergies are accommodated through an Emergency Action Plan (EAP), an Individual Health Care Plan (IHCP), and/or Section 504 Plan and not an IEP. However, food allergies may contribute to a health impairment qualifying as a disability under IDEA or some students may qualify under IDEA for services and also ha ve a food allergy. However, according to 22 PA Code Chapters 14 & 15, in PA, students may only be eligib le under IDEA or Section 504, not both. Each child's IEP must include the supplementary aids a nd services to be provided for, or on behalf of, the child and a statement of the program modifications or supports for school personnel that will be provided so the child can make progress and be involved in th e general curriculum. Admi nistering an epinephrine auto-injector and providing assistance in reducing exposure to allergens are two examples of related services, supplementary aids and services, or pr ogram modifications or su pports that schools could provide for a particular student with life-threatening food allergie s who is eligible under IDEA. F AMILY EDUCATION RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) FERPA generally prohibits schools from disclosing personally identifiable information in a student's education record, unless the school obtains the consent of the student's parent or the eligible student (a student who is 18 years old or olde r, or who attends an institution of postsecondary education.) FERPA does allow schools to disclose this information, wit hout obtaining consent, to school officials, including teachers, who have legitimate educational interests in the information and in the educational interests of the child. Schools that do this must include, in their annual notification to pare nts and eligible students, the criteria for determining who constitutes a school official and what constitutes a legitimate educational interest. Additionally, under FERPA, schools may not prev ent the parent/guardian of students, or eligible students themselves, from inspecting and re viewing the student's education records. 52 OBTAINING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) in the U.S. Department of Education can answer questions a nd provide technical assist ance.

State Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines PENNSYLVANIA PUBLIC SCHOOL CODE OF 1949 (PSC)1 Act 104 of 2010 amended the Pennsylvania Public Sc hool Code to require that school policies and procedures must clearly define circumstances under which self-administration of medication is permitted and describe the decision maki ng process. These policies must: Require a written statement (medical order) fr om the physician, Certified Registered Nurse Practitioner, or Physician Assistant whether the st udent is qualified and able to self-administer the medication. This prescription sha ll be required on an annual basis. Require parental/guardian a pprovals on an annual basis. Require the Certified School Nurse (CSN) to ensure that the student is capable for self-care in the use of an epinephrine auto -injector through demonstration of administration skills and responsible behavior. Determination of competen cy shall be based on age, cognitive function, and maturity. Provide for the periodic and ongoing assessment by the CSN of the student's self-management skills. Require notification of the CSN immediately following each use. Include provisions for the immediate confis cation of the medicati on and loss of self- administration privileges if the school policies are abused or ignored. If privileges are revoked, the Emergency Care Plan (ECP) would need to be revised to ensure close proximity of the medication to the student. The PSC requires that every child of school age be provided with school nurse services as part of the school health program. While state la w and regulations mandate that e ach school district provide nursing services, the actual day-to-day ac tivities of school nurses are assigne d by the school districts and the Pennsylvania Department of Health pr escribes the technical content of the school health services program. Each of the six state health district offices employs a school health consultant to assist schools, parents, and the community at large regarding school health services and programs. The current nurse to student ratio of 1:1,500 is set forth in Section 1402 of the PSC, which was added by the Act of July 15, 1957. There are no state mandated ratios for nurses to special needs students\u2014each 1 Excerpts from the Joint State Government Commission's 2004 Repor t on Laws Regulating School Nurs es in Pennsylvania and Other States: http://jsg.legis.state.pa.us/NURSES%20REPORT.HTML 53 school district is responsible for meeting the needs of sp ecial populations. Also, pursuant to the school code, Department of Health Regulations found at 28 PA Code \u00a723.53 clarify that \"The school administrator, in determining the number of pupils to be served by a school nurse, sh all consider the number of schools, distance between schools, travel difficulties, and sp ecial health needs of the area.\" PENNSYLVANIA NURSE PRACTICE ACT The school nurse and any support personnel who have nur sing licenses (e.g., RN or LPN) must meet the standards and regulations of the Pe nnsylvania Nurse Practice Act, whic h is the responsibility of the Department of State, Pennsylvania State Board of Nursing. Under the Nurse Practice Act, there is no provision for a registered nurse (RN) to delegate nursing tasks to an unlicensed individual. However, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Stat e, Board of Nursing, RNs may train unlicensed individuals to assist with the admi nistration of asthma inhalers and ep inephrine auto-injectors. Health workers who are not certifie d school nurses, including RNs, licensed practical nurses (LPNs), and unlicensed assistive personne l (UAP) must work under the supervisi on of the school nurse and cannot be assigned a caseload. A licensed nurse must have an order for medications . Without an order, licensed nurses administering medication are diagnosing and prescribing treatment, which is outside of nursing practice parameters and is within the practice of medicine defined by the Medical Practice Act of 1985. As part of their student services plan, schools and school dist ricts must develop policies and pr ocedures for emergency care and administration of medication and treatment in comp liance with the Controlled Substances, Drugs, Device and Cosmetic Act and guidelines issued by the Depa rtment of Health. Parents/guardians should inquire about the policies and pract ices that are implemente d in their schools. P ENNSYLVANIA PRACTICAL NURSE ACT Under the Practical Nurse Law (63 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 651 - 667.8), [t]he 'practice of practical nursing' means the performance of selected nursing acts in the care of the ill, injured, or infirm under the direction of a licensed professional nurse, a licensed physician, or a licensed dentist which do not require the specialized skill, judgment, and knowledge requ ired in professional nursing.

Code \u00a7 21.145 (a) further define the scope of practical nursing and state that: \"[t]he LPN is prepared to function as a member of the health care team...\" and \"participates in the planning, implementation, and eval uation of nursing care in settings where nursing takes place.\" A licensed practical nurse (LPN) may not function i ndependently in the school setting. The CSN must provide medical oversight to the LPN. Medical oversight does not nece ssarily mean direct, line-of-sight supervision, but should include, at a minimu m, periodic and regular communication. An LPN may administer medications as prescribed by law or regulation. 49 Pa Code \u00a721.145 (b) states: \"The LPN administers medication and carries out th erapeutic treatment ordered for the patient...\" D EPARTMENT OF EDUCATION REGULATIONS REGARDING ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICATIONS 22 PA CODE, 12.41 STUDENT SERVICES Schools are required to develop a wri tten student services plan, based on the needs of their students.

The study was published in the Journa l of Allergy and C linical Immunology. Surfaces Researchers looked for cleaning methods for removing peanut allergens from surfaces. They found that common household cleaning agents, su ch as Formula 409\u00ae, Lysol\u00ae Sanitizing wipes, and Target\u00ae brand cleaners with bleach, removed peanut allergen from ta bletops. However, dishwashing liquid left traces of the allergen on 25 percent of the tables. Do not use dishwashing liquid to wash surfaces. Hands To test the efficacy of cleaning methods for removi ng peanut allergens from hands, researchers applied peanut butter to the hands of non-allergic volunteers and then removed the a llergen by using different cleaning methods. 25 percent of the hands cleaned using water only s till had detectable levels of allergen (peanut butter). Do not use water only to wash hands. 50 percent of the hands cleaned using antibacterial hand sanitizer still had detectable levels of allergen (peanut butter). Do not use antib acterial hand sanitizer to wash hands. All hands cleaned using commercial wipes (Wet On es\u00ae, Tidy Tykes\u00ae flushable wipes) were free from the allergen (peanut butter). All hands cleaned using liquid soap or bar soap were free from the allergen (peanut butter). Summary Surfaces Do not use dishwasher liquid to wash surfaces. Hands Do not use water only to wash hands. Do not use antibacterial hand sanitizer to wash hands. Do not use surface wipes like Lysol\u00ae sanitizing wipes or Target\u00ae brand cleaners to wash a student's hand or face. Wet wipes manufactured for the use on skin should be the only wipes used on a student. (Perry, T.T., Conover-Walker, M.K.

S. \u00a7 \u00a7 780-101\u2014780-144) and guidelines issued by the Department of Health. Guidelines for Pennsylvania Schools for the Administration of Medications and Emergency Care are available on the \"What's New with School Health\" page of the Department of Health website, http://www.portal.state.pa.us/por tal/server.pt/community/school s/14130/what%27s_new_with_school_he alth/556690 Medication Orders Individual Orders The CSN should be familiar with cu rrent laws and regulations govern ing health professionals' scope of practice pertaining to medicati on in the Commonwealth. In addition to licensed physicians, CRNPs and PAs may have prescriptive authority, if approved by the Department of State. The CSN must ensure that there is a medication or der from a licensed prescriber for each medication to be administered. A prescription provides in struction to the pharmacist for dispensing the medication, while a medication order provides instru ction to the nurse for administration of the medication. Written, faxed, or electronic orders : Medication orders from a lic ensed prescriber should be provided to the school nurse in wr iting with an original signature , or an authorized electronic signature. These orders can be accepted from a licensed pr escriber on his/her letterhead, prescription pad, or on a form provided by the school for this purpose, and signed and dated by a licensed prescriber. Oral (Verbal) orders : There are circumstances, such as an immediate change in medication dosage, when oral orders may need to be used, until a written order can be obtained. A physician assistant, certified registered nurse pr actitioner, and a registered nurse may accept these types of orders. Also, a licensed pr actical nurse may accept a verbal order for medication under the conditions set fort h at 49 Pa. Code \u00a7 21.145 (2) - (5). Ideally, a written order should be received w ithin five (5) school days. In accordance with standard medical practice, a medi cation order from a licensed prescriber should contain: Student's name; Name and signature of the licen sed prescriber and phone number; Name of the medication; Route and dosage of medication; Frequency and time of medication administration; Date of the order and discontinuation date; 66 Specific directions for admi nistration, if necessary. Standing Orders Standing orders are medical direct ives written by the school's phys ician for licensed health care providers. These orders author ize administration of specific em ergency medications such as epinephrine auto-injectors to students according to a defined protocol. The health team, school physician, school administrator and school board should engage in a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of having standing orders prio r to the adoption of the medication policy. Parent/guardian approval (consent) is not needed for the admini stration of medications during a life threatening emergency. Standing orders for emergency medications should be reviewed, updated and signed by the school physician annually. The health office in each school building must have a copy of the signed standing orders on file. School standing orders may include an order from the school physic ian for the licensed health care providers to administer epinephrine auto-injecto rs to students who are not known to have a life- threatening food allergy, do not have their own me dication order and have their first anaphylactic reaction in school. This st anding order may also include an or der to administer a second dose of epinephrine if the symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction have not subs ided within a specified number of minutes with the first dose of epinephrine. Parent/Guardian Consent With the exception of medications administered vi a standing order during a lif e threatening emergency, all medications given in the school setting must have a written authorization (consent) from a parent/guardian. The written authorization, rene wed at the start of each school year by the parent/guardian, should contain: A parent/guardian's printed name, signa ture, and an emergency phone number; Approval to have the CSN, or in the absence of th e CSN, other licensed school health staff (RN, LPN) administer medications; A list of all other medications that the student is currently taking (recommended). Documentation of Medication Administration Individual Student Medication Record Any medication given during schoo l hours must be documented on an individual student medication record which becomes part of the student's School Health Record . Whether records are manually or electronically maintained, the followi ng information should be included: Name of student; Date and time medication was given; Name of medication; Dose of medication; Route and site of administration; Signature of licensed person administer ing/observing medication being taken; In the case of PRN medications, results should also be charted to docum ent whether appropriate results are being obtained. School health records should include documentation of medication orders, parent /guardian consent, and an individual medication Teacher/Grade: _____________________ In accordance with school policy, medication(s) should be given at home before and/or after school. However, when this is not possible, pr ior to receiving the medication at school, each student must provide the school nurse with a Medication Administration Consent form signed by the student's parent/guardian and a Medication Order from a licensed prescriber. All medications must be in an original prescription bottle/ container from a pharmacy.

Strict avoidance of p eanut/nut products is the only way to prevent a life-threatening allergic reaction. We are asking yo ur assistance in providing th e student with a safe learning environment. If exposed to peanuts/nuts, the student may de velop a life-threatening allergic reaction that requires emergency medical treatment. The gr eatest potential for expos ure at school is to peanut/nut products. To reduce the risk of exposur e, the classroom will be peanut/nut free. Please do not send any peanut or nut containing produc ts for your child to eat during snack in the classroom. Any exposure to peanut s or nuts through contact or ingestion can cause a severe reaction. If your child has eaten peanut or nut prior to coming to school, please be sure your child's hands have been thoroughly wash ed prior to enteri ng the school. Since lunch is eaten in the cafeteria, your chil d may bring peanut butter and peanut or nut products for lunch. In the cafeter ia, there will be a designated peanut-free table where any classmate without peanut or nut products can sit. If your child sits at this table with a peanut or nut product, he/she will be asked to move to another table. This plan will help to maintain safety in the classroom while allowing non allergic classmates to enjoy peanut/nut products in a controlled environment. Following lunch, the child ren will wash their ha nds prior to going to recess (or returning to the class.) The ta bles will be cleaned after each lunch. We appreciate your support of thes e procedures. Please complete and return this form so we are certain that every family has r eceived this information.
