Overview For each release event from the NBAF that causes a Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) infection at a livestock premises, the consequences of that outbreak must be calculated to understand overall risk. The following approach was taken to predict the probability of an outbreak occurring following a release, to determine where the outbreak begins, and to determine the corresponding consequences of the outbreak: Determine the probability that an outbreak starts in various possible locations given release quantity and transport pathways; Estimate the extent and duration of the possible FMD outbreaks in Kansas; Determine the probability that an outbreak would spread from Kansas to other states; Estimate the extent and duration of possible FMD outbreaks in states other than Kansas; and Determine overall risk by combining impact and probability of outbreaks occurring across the region for each release amount and transport pathway. Although this analysis is extensive and is substantially based on data collected from the field and the scientific literature, it is fundamentally a modeling-based approach and therefore has limited ability to predict the absolute probability of an outbreak occurring and the corresponding consequences. That being said, given the shortcomings of the modeling approach (as described in section 6.2.2), the data presented include as thorough a treatment of uncertainty in the modeling as possible. Aleatory uncertainty related to the location in which the outbreak starts (which can be a function of the meteorology on the date the accident happens, for example) is displayed along with uncertainty related to how the outbreak unfolds. Outbreak consequences have components of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. For example, one source of aleatory uncertainty arises from the timing of an animal shipment relative to the infection of animals on a premises. An example of a source of epistemic uncertainty is the probability of infection should a veterinarian visit an infected farm before visiting an uninfected farm. This uncertainty is presented to provide a reasonable range of possible outbreak risks. Given that the model is sensitive to many parameters that are themselves uncertain (for example, the risk of infection as a result of indirect contacts between two dairies separated by a distance), it is possible that the true absolute risk of an outbreak lies outside this range, but this is a shortcoming that cannot be addressed by modeling; only further data collection can reduce epistemic uncertainty. Results that speak to the relative benefit and cost of measures to reduce risk are presented in the context of the uncertainty described above and also subjected to sensitivity analysis. In the uncertainty 403 Table 6.1.2-1: Dat a Used to Select States to be Include d in the Reg ion Mo deled State % of total movemen ts out of Kansas in 2001 (Shields & Mathews Jr., 2003) % of animals shipped from nine county area near the NBAF Nebraska 35 53 Colorado 20 3 Iowa 14 35 Missouri 12 .5 Texas 6 4 Oklahoma 2 1 Updated SSRA an alysis, modeling parameters are varied to ensure that the conclusions are robust. Uncertainty analysis is useful in this context because the value of risk mitigation measures can be understood by their relative effect on risk. 6.1.2 Region Modeled The states modeled for the Updated SSRA were chosen based on SME input, the Interstate Livestock Movement Report [Shields & Mathews Jr., 2003] and destinations listed on Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (CVIs) issued for animals leaving the nine counties (Marshall, Washington, Clay, Riley, Pottawatomie, Geary, Waubaunsee, Dickinson, and Morris Counties) nearest the NBAF during the first seven months of 2011 (see Appendix A6, Epidemiological Methods). The Interstate Livestock Movement Report carried more weight than the CVI data in this process because this report accounts for movement of animals from across the entire state for a full calendar year. Based on these sources, the region modeled included: Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa, Missouri, Texas, and Oklahoma. These states account for 89% of animals leaving the state of Kansas, and 96.5% of animals leaving the area near the NBAF to travel to another state (Table 6.1.2-1). Like Oklahoma, Minnesota receives only 2% of total outbound animal shipments; however, Oklahoma was included in the modeling because it shares a border with Kansas. According to the National Agricultural Statistical Services (NASS), these seven states account for 66% of the total cattle, 47% of the total swine, 49% of the total sheep, and 32% of the total goat population in the United States. The approach to handling spread of FMD from Kansas to other states does not take into account secondary spread from other states and therefore animal shipments originating in states other than Kansas were not considered when determining which states to model (see section 6.1.5). The 2010 SSRA was criticized for failing to include all 50 states, Canada, and Mexico. It was also criticiz ed for modeling too large a region given the limitations of the modeling program used, the North American Animal Disease Spread Model (NAADSM, version 3.2.18) [NAADSM Development Team, 2011] and for using a single set of parameters to describe livestock agriculture in diverse regions of the United States. There are many impediments to adequately addressing these critiques in the Updated SSRA. To 404 Updated SSRA date, no group has developed parameters for use within NAADSM that adequately account for interstate movement of animals, although one could approximate interstate transport by modeling states individually (as described here) or by using state-specific or region-specific parameterization. Next, the amount of effort needed to develop parameters to adequately model the diversity of agriculture in the United States, much less all of North America, would require multiple years of full-time investment. Even with the parameters and models in place, the computational power needed to run the experiments required for the Updated SSRA with such a model outstrips available resources. Given the approach chosen, it is important to note that economic estimates based on the outputs of the economic model for the Updated SSRA will, again, underestimate the absolute impact of an outbreak of FMD originating from the NBAF because the outbreak is artificially limited to the region modeled instead of the whole of North America. However, these data are still very useful for comparing the relative severity of an outbreak given different release events and mitigation strategies. 6.1.3 Determining Outbreak Starting Locations To determine the consequences and extent of an FMDv outbreak resulting from a release from the NBAF, it must be determined where an outbreak starts. As discussed below (section 6.1.4), the impact and extent of the outbreak depends significantly on the type of livestock initially infected and the connectedness of the infected premises with the livestock industry as a whole. Section 4 describes the method to estimate the probability of an event occurring, the method to determine the amount of pathogen released and the means by which the infectious material is transported in the environment. This section describes the use of these outputs to calculate the probability that any given premises becomes infected with FMDv. The method to calculate risk of infection at any premises is specific to an event pathway. In the following subsections, the methods used for three pathways are described: infectious aerosol releases; contaminated personnel or fomites; and the release of contaminated waste. 6.1.3.1 Aerosol Pathways Several release events at the NBAF generate an infectious aerosol. In this section, the method to predict where outbreaks begin due to the release of an aerosol of FMDv due to an event at the NBAF is described. This method was NOT used to predict how aerosols would contribute to the spread of FMD from one infected herd to a susceptible herd (NAADSM was used to predict the contribution of aerosols generated by infected animals outside of the NBAF to the spread of disease). As described in Section 5, the time-integrated concentration of FMDv in a release is calculated based on the possible meteorology at the site and is then used to calculate the risk that an accidentally generated aerosol starts an infection in any livestock premises downwind. In the 2010 SSRA, any livestock premises where animals inhaled 0.1 plaque forming unit (PFU a PFU of FMDv is roughly equivalent to one viable virus) or more on average were considered to be at a location where a single infection could occur. This approach was taken for several reasons. First, the plume models calculated mean dosage, while in reality some of the animals in this location received more than this amount and some received less. Secondly, a viral aerosol is composed of discrete biological particles which cannot deliver a nonzero dose less than 1 PFU (that is, an animal either inhales more than one 405 Tab le 6.1.3-1: Th e Probit Slope and ID 50 for Catt le, Swine and Shee p Exposed t o FMDV via Aer osol Anim Probit Slope ID50 (PFU) 0.33 15 Swine 0.89 30,000 Sheep (and goats) 0.72 3 Data supporting this an alysis can be found in Appendi x A6. Updated SSRA virus particle, one virus particle, or inhales none). Therefore in an area with a mean inhaled dose of 0.1 PFU, most of the animals present likely would inhale no pathogens, and a minority of the animals present would inhale one. Although a minimum infectious dose (MID) is often reported for FMD, other low levels of contamination (even if all animals receive less than the reported MID) there is still a SSRA assumed that an infection started at any premises that received more than 0.1 PFU on average. However, the method used in the 2010 SSRA had several weaknesses. First, the dose threshold set was not strongly evidence-based. Secondly, this method does not consider that risk of at least one infection in a herd should be a function of the number of exposed animals in that herd. That is, a herd of 100 animals is more likely to suffer at least one infection if all animals received a small dose than is a herd of 10 animals receiving a similar dose. For these reasons, the Updated SSRA uses a more rigorous method to calculate the probability of infection from any dose downwind that explicitly considers the number of animals in each premises. In the Updated SSRA, the time-integrated concentration of FMDv was obtained by atmospheric modeling at each exposed livestock premises. Using species specific minute-tidal volumes for sheep, swine and cattle, these data were used to calculate a dose for an average animal on that premises. For goats, the sheep minute tidal volume was used. To calculate the probability that an individual animal would get infected by any given dose, probit analysis was used. The data sources used to support this analysis are provided in Appendix A6, Infectious Dose 50 (ID 50) and Probit Analysis: Aerosol and Intranasal Exposure. The probit relationship enables the calculation of a probability of infection for an animal for any given dose, not just the median infectious dose. Note that although the ID 50 for sheep was considered to be smaller than the ID 50 for cattle, the larger minute-tidal volume of cattle actually makes them more susceptible to an aerosol of a given concentration. For goats, the sheep dose-response curve was used. For swine, this relationship can be used to predict nonzero probabilities of infection at very low doses of FMD v. To account for the fact that larger herds will be at greater risk of suffering at least one infection from an aerosol than smaller herds, the probability of infection for an individual animal was used to determine the probability of infection of at least one animal in a herd by considering that each animal in that herd would have an independent chance of infection. Given this method, each premises was 406 Updated SSRA assigned a dose threshold (which is a function of herd size), above which the probability of infection of at least one animal was greater than 50% (Figure 6.1.3-1). This analysis works well because there are no swine herds that have a threshold dose lower than one PFU that were exposed to artificially generated aerosols from the NBAF (which is approximately equal to one infectious viral particle of FMDv). Figure 6.1.3-1: Threshold dose of FMDv to generate a 50% probability of at least one infection in a herd of swine. Both axes are log scale. Note that the threshold for a herd of one animal is equal to the ID 50 and the threshold drops below one PFU only for very large swine herds. Should a herd of swine with more than 1,000 be exposed to aerosols generated from accidents at the NBAF, this analysis would be extended. For cattle and sheep, however, the shallow probit slope and low ID 50 combine to predict significant probabilities of infection at doses well below 1 PFU. For example, probit analysis suggests that at least one animal in a herd of 10 cattle is likely to become infected by a dose of 0.001 PFU (a dose for which the probability of infection per animal is predicted to be near 7%). Therefore the method used for swine is unrealistic for cattle and sheep because an animal is not at risk if exposed to less than a single infectious viral particle and real aerosols can deliver only whole particles, not fractional ones. That is, a 50% probability of infection of at least one animal is predicted to occur when all the animals in the herd combined receives less than 1/100th of a PFU, which the Updated SSRA team knows would pose no risk 407 Tab le 6.1.3-2: Sma llest Min imum Infectious Doses Proposed in the Literature, as Desc ribed in App endix A6 Anim al Minimum Infectious Dose Cattle 9 PFU Swine 150 PFU Sheep (and goats) 7 PFU Updated SSRA o f infection because no animal in the herd is predicted to inhale at least one virus particle. To further assess this very low threshold for cattle, a model was used in which 210 PFU of FMDv was released from the NBAF across the suite of meteorological conditions. Even though the premises infected represented less than 1/1,000th of the total footprint of the aerosol plumes generated, this tiny release resulted in the simultaneous infection of up to three different premises, further underscoring that this threshold is unrealistically low for cattle. For these reasons, a strictly probit-based threshold was not used for cattle and sheep facilities. In place of the method used for swine, the baseline approach for determining which cattle and sheep premises are infected by an aerosol uses the likelihood of at least one animal in a herd inhaling 1 PFU, as this value is close to the minimum dose that could be delivered by a biological aerosol and can plausibly cause an infection. Because of the low ID 50 and shallow probit slope of FMDv in cattle and sheep, the probability of infection at 1 PFU is predicted to be significant (35% for cattle). In the calculations, the dose entrained by each animal in a herd is summed; if the herd collectively inhales 1 PFU or more, an infection is considered to occur. For example, an infection would occur in a herd of 10 cattle if the dose received by a cow in this location was calculated to be 0.1 PFU or greater, whereas the threshold for a 500 cattle operation would be 0.002 PFU. This method relies on the assumption that the air around the herd is well mixed. Many researchers have proposed that there is no risk of infection for doses of FMDv lower than a Appendix A6, Infectious Dose 50 (ID 50) and Probit Analysis: Aerosol and Intranasal Exposure. The smallest value proposed for the minimum infectious dose is presented in Table 6.1.3- 2. These values might represent a phenomenon in which a minimum number of pathogen particles are requ ired to overcome host defenses and establish an infection, or they could be an artifact of the use of a small number of animals in infection experiments (i.e., if five animals were used, identifying doses that cause less than a 20% probability of infection is difficult). The method based on minimum infectious dose is used in the sensitivity analysis described below to examine risk if a less aggressive threshold of infection is used for cattle and sheep (and goats). Additionally, the modification of these two thresholds by a factor of two is explored to determine if the exact values used in the thresholds significantly drive the risk that an infection will start in a premises. 408 Updated SSRA Animal Cattle Swine Sheep/goats Aerosol Table 6.1.3 -3: Probit Slope and ID 50 for Cattle, Swine, and She ep/Goats Exposed to FMDv via Baseline Threshold Basis Alternate Threshold Basis 1 PFU inhaled by herd in aggregate One minimum infectious dose Probit analysis Probit analysis 1 PFU inhaled by herd in aggregate One minimum infectious dose inhaled by herd in aggregate inhaled by herd in aggregate Data supporting this analysis can be found in Appendix A6. Additionally, in this study, an aerosol was considered to pose two possible infection pathways for susceptible species: direct inhalation of pathogens suspended in an aerosol by an animal, or ingestion by an animal of grass or fodder contaminated by pathogens deposited by an aerosol. However, it was determined that it is very unlikely that a herd will have an animal that received an infection via ingestion of aerosol-contaminated material and not also have an animal infected directly from the aerosol. When the dose expected to be directly inhaled was compared to the amount expected to be consumed through aerosol deposition, it was found that the inhaled dose was several-fold larger. In addition, the FMDv oral ID 50 is several orders of magnitude greater than the FMDv inhalation ID 50 (Alexandersen et al., 2003). Finally, many animals in Kansas are fed processed feeds which present a much smaller surface area for aerosol contamination compared to grass-based forage. For these reasons, although infection from pathogens deposited by an aerosol was considered, it was determined that this pathway posed no additional risk over direct infection from the aerosol itself. 6.1.3.2 Transference Pathways There exist innumerable paths from the release event to outbreak initiation via transference (the transport of infectious material in or on a person or fomite). In order to determine the most likely of these paths, employees of the Biosecurity Research Institute (BRI) at Kansas State University (K-State) were interviewed on their typical movements and behaviors both within the BRI and upon leaving the facility. The BRI is a new BSL-3E and large animal (BSL-3Ag) research facility immediately adjacent to the site on which the NBAF is being constructed. This proximity allows BRI researchers and employees to serve as valid proxies for describing the behaviors of the workers at the NBAF. These workers are drawn from the same community that will provide workers for the NBAF, thus the two groups will represent similar demographics in terms of outside activities. In addition, the similarities in activities within each facility (both provide containment research space for high consequence agricultural pathogens) ensure that behaviors within the two facilities are comparable. FMD is not studied at the BRI, however, so some assumptions had to be made to account for behaviors that some BRI employees displayed that would be prohibited when working with FMDv; these are described in Section 5.4. Once an outbreak is predicted to occur due to the transference pathway, the outbreak starting location is determined by analyzing the interview data gathered from personnel on the K-State campus. When an location. The probability that an outbreak would start at any given location is proportional to the 409 Updated SSRA number of respondents who mentioned visiting farms in that location. This method therefore explicitly considers that outbreaks caused by transference may not start near the NBAF. That is, if 20% of respondents mentioned visiting farms in Topeka, the model would start 20% of the outbreaks from transference in Topeka. Because the majority of livestock premises in Kansas are cow-calf operations (and because respondents did not give consistent premises types in their responses), each outbreak was considered to start in a cow-calf operation. Rodeos and state fairs are not premises types currently modeled in NAADSM, so these locations were ignored as possible starting locations to determine the extent of an outbreak (importantly, they still contribute to the chance that an outbreak occurs as described above). To maintain privacy of the respondents, farm location data was collected at the town-or county-level only (no specific addresses were collected); therefore a median-sized cow-calf operation was selected for each location mentioned. A total of 27 researchers and support staff at the BRI were interviewed. Both scientific and support staff were selected in order to account for all types of personnel that will be present in the NBAF; these included research scientists, laboratory technicians, a graduate student, K-State faculty, a veterinarian, lab coordinators, biosafety specialists, maintenance and building systems personnel, security personnel, and a network technician. In addition to BRI employees, 110 people selected randomly from locations on the K-State campus were interviewed. This group of people was chosen to represent the community surrounding the NBAF and determine likely points of interaction between the two communities. Both groups of participants were asked how often they visited facilities that contain susceptible species, including farms, campus facilities with livestock, veterinarian offices, rodeos and state and county fairs. The locations and species present at these facilities were recorded. Participants were asked whether they handled animals or were simply at the location. Additionally, participants were asked the occupations of the people they live with, and whether any individuals with whom they have regular contact handle livestock. Sixty-six of the 137 people interviewed (27 from the BRI, 110 from K-State) indicated that they visit livestock on a regular basis. These 137 interviewees described visiting 66 farms that correspond to 37 unique locations in Kansas. These sites were very evenly spread across the state of Kansas; the mean and median distances from the NBAF were 103.2 and 95.5 miles, respectively (Table 6.1.3-4). The majorities of farm locations were unique, and thus had a 2.1% chance of being the starting point of an infection each. Only five of the locations were mentioned by multiple interview participants; the most common was Manhattan, Kansas, with a probability of 10.6% to be the starting location (Table 6.1.3-5). A few respondents mentioned that they visited susceptible species outside of Kansas (in other US states and as far away as Mexico). Because the model developed for this study calculates interstate spread only from Kansas and not all of the locations mentioned are modeled in this study (e.g., Mexico), outbreaks initiated in other states were re-assigned a probability of starting in Kansas (otherwise, outbreaks modeled as beginning in other states would be artificially small because the model does not consider that the disease can spread from any other state to another except from Kansas). 410 Table 6.1.3 -5: Locations of Farms Visited by Interview Subjects Location Number of % of Responses Responses Manhattan 5 10.64% Huchins on 3 6.38% Clay Co. 2 4.26% Marshall Co. 2 4.26% Riley Co. 2 4.26% Washington Co. 2 4.26% Wichita 2 4.26% Allen 1 2.13% Alma 1 2.13% Blaine 1 2.13% Claflin 1 2.13% Updated SSRA The method used captures the possibility that events at the NBAF could initiate outbreaks far from Manhattan, Kansas. As described below, because all starting locations are considered cow-calf operations (because they are the preponderance of locations in Kansas), there is relatively little variance in the results due to starting locations (section 6.2). To address this shortcoming, a method must be devised to sample a possible starting location without biasing the results to assume that an outbreak always starts in a higher-risk premises (like a large feedlot) in locations that would normally be represented by a single starting location. Potentially, the number of each type of facility in each location mentioned by an interviewee could be calculated to determine the probability of an outbreak starting in any particular facility type. This approach would greatly expand the number of model runs needed to simulate risk from transference. Even with this shortcoming, because the probability of a start in a given location is based on the number of respondents mentioning that site was visited, this method does capture how much of the outbreak starting risk is nearby the NBAF and distant from it. This method therefore greatly informs the benefit of potential mitigation measures that are specific to regions surrounding the NBAF (active surveillance, educational programs for producers, etc.).

Scott City Seneca Spring Hill Topeka Valley Center Wamego Winfield 6.1.3.3 Waste Pathways To determine where outbreaks may start due to events that allow infectious waste to accidentally leave the NBAF, likely locations of contaminated waste were compared to the locations of susceptible species. Simply put, for each transport pathway, the closest livestock premises was identified as the starting location. For the solid waste pathway, the premises closest to the Riley County Transfer Station and to the location of the final disposition of waste, Hamm Quarry in Jefferson County, were identified. For the liquid waste pathways, the premises closest to the location of the spills were identified. If two types o f livestock were present on the premises, these premises were considered as two possible starting locations (because no one has developed a straightforward mechanism to allow NAADSM to account for facilities housing multiple species of animals see section 6.1.4.3 for more detailed discussion). 412 Updated SSRA 6.1.4 Estimating Extent of Outbreaks in Kansas The extent and duration of FMD outbreaks in Kansas were estimated using the NAADSM v 3.2.18, a stochastic state-transition model that simulates outbreaks of animal disease in a geographically defined population. Disease progression, disease spread and outbreak control are parameterized by the user. This section describes the parameters used to build the baseline NAADSM event file for the state of Kansas, which was used to estimate the extent of an outbreak of FMD using outbreak starting locations identified for each potential NBAF release pathway (see section 6.1.3). 6.1.4.1 Choice of Epidemiological Model For the 2010 SSRA, several models described in the peer-reviewed literature were evaluated for epidemiological modeling. The North American Animal Disease Spread Model (NAADSM) was selected for use in the 2010 SSRA FMD modeling [DHS, 2010] and used again in this Updated SSRA. USDA also uses NAADSM for their FMD epidemiological modeling, allowing the Updated SSRA team to leverage the parameters developed for USDA studies in this analysi s. 6.1.4.2 USDA NAADSM Parameter Sets The data used to develop NAADSM parameters came from a variety of sources including government reports, open source literature and interviews with subject matter experts (SMEs). Parameter sets developed for FMD and other epidemiological models at USDA and DHS were leveraged to ensure the Updated SSRA epidemiological model was built using the best available data. Several of these reports are not publicly available, but were used extensively for parameter development. Two NAADSM modeling studies completed at USDA provided many of the parameters used for the Updated SSRA epidemiological model. These reports will be referenced in the upcoming text using the following abbreviations: D! D! Draft. Vaccination Against Foot-and-Mouth Disease: Epidemiologic and Consequences of Production Specific Vaccination Strategies. USDA\u00ad APHIS- VS-CEAH. Fort Collins, Colorado. D! D! Draft. Model Scenario and Parameters for Estimating the Number of Foot-and --Mouth Disease Vaccine Doses Required in the Event of an Outbreak in Kansas. USDA-APHIS- VS-CEAH. Fort Collins, Colorado. The Updated SSRA team carefully reviewed the underlying evidence basis and the logic used to create the USDA parameters and corresponded with report authors when additional information was necessary to understand parameter development; this correspondence is sometimes referenced in the parameter development section. USDA updated several parameters from the 2009 study (so the study parameters do not match the Updated SSRA parameters); these updates are noted. 6.1.4.3 NAADSM Modeling Parameter Development and Data Collection The NAADSM modeling parameter section is organized using the order in which data is entered into NAADSM through event parameter entry prompts in order to ensure that all input parameters are 413 Updated SSRA accounted for and to facilitate independent validation of results. A parameter entry guide is provided in Appendix A6 that collates all parameters and gives instructions for check box selections that are only implied in the main body of the write-up. The Appendix is intended to provide a level of detail sufficient to set up a NAADSM event file and repeat Updated SSRA experiments, while this section focuses on giving an overview of the evidence basis and parameter development methods. When a detailed discussion is required for an individual parameter, a supplemental section is referenced in the Appendix. Subject matter experts consulted for parameter development are listed in Appendix, Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) Consulted for Parameter Development, and are sorted by parameter. Individual interviews are not referenced in the parameter development discussion because as many as 15 SMEs may have been consulted when developing a parameter. General NAADSM Setup General NAADSM setup, including the number of iterations run per event, can be found in Appendix A6. Production Types Most of the production types used for the Updated SSRA were based on USDA 2009. These production types included both sheep and goats, addressing concerns expressed by SSRA reviewers. Three additional production types were developed in response to SSRA reviewer comments to describe backyard and small-scale producer facilities. Parameters associated with these production types were developed from interview data and SME input. In addition to domestic livestock, wildlife (including feral swine) almost certainly contribute to the spread of FMD [Mohamed et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2011]. Several susceptible wildlife species were identified in Kansas, including small populations of elk, pronghorn, feral swine and a significant deer population (see Appendix A6). At this time, no one has developed a method to quantitatively include wildlife in NAADSM. Local area spread parameters attempt to capture some of the contribution of wildlife to FMD spread during an outbreak, but this representation does not capture the full impact wildlife may have on an outbreak. Therefore, wildlife was not included in the Updated SSRA. Updated SSRA Production Types In NAADSM, farms are grouped by production type. All farms within a production type share characteristics due to similar livestock management practices and the presence of the same species of animal. For example, one would expect that the frequency with which a farmer observes his cattle to be similar for all dairies, so the probability of a farmer observing a sick cow is defined by one function that applies to all dairies.

The Updated SSRA team has separated feedlots into backgrounders/stockers and finish feedlots based on NASS feedlot size designations.

Detailed parameters describing backyard producers were not regularly included in published FMD models, and the epidemiological modeling parameters used for SSRA were sourced from published models which prevented the inclusion of this facility type in the 2010 SSRA. NAS expressed concern over the exclusion of these producers from the 2010 SSRA. BY-SS producers were included in the Updated SSRA model as 415 Updated SSRA three production types: Beef (BY-SS), Swine (BY-SS), and Small Ruminants (BY-SS). A small-scale producer (regardless of animal species), for this project, has been defined as 10 head or less. Based on SME input, BY-SS producers are a very small subset of the livestock industry, especially in terms of animal numbers. Very little data are available on BY-SS producers. The MESA model incorporated backyard production types [Tammero et al., 2010]. MESA and NAADSM use different parameters to describe and model disease spread, so the MESA backyard parameters could not be used directly in NAADSM. Insufficient information was available on the evidence basis and parameter development for MESA to support the development of NAADSM parameters using data from MESA. This year, BY-SS production types were developed from interviews conducted with 30 producers at state fairs in Kansas and SMEs. According to SMEs, the majority of small-scale Kansas producers are involved with 4-H and Future Farmers of America (FFA). Two of these 30 producers did not exhibit animals at county fairs, so they would represent the non-4H or FFA producer. In addition, three small-scale producers from Riley County, Kansas, were interviewed as part of the regional survey near the NBAF. These three producers also were not 4H or FFA members. The data gathered to date from personal interviews with Kansas small-scale producers indicate that a veterinarian would be called if an animal were thought to be sick and therefore would not support the conclusion that these producers would knowingly transport a sick animal to a livestock market just to get rid of it, a concern expressed during the NAS panel discussion for the Updated SSRA. Interviews are described in detail in Appendix A6, Backyard and Small-Scale (BY-SS) Producer Interviews and Data. One major shortcoming of this dataset is the small number of producers interviewed. It was also difficult to obtain estimates of the number and location of backyard facilities. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Agricultural Census data, the most $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, D! BY-SS producers, and addressing this shortcoming is a major challenge. Facilities with Multiple Production Types During data collection for BY-SS facility parameter development, it became clear that a large proportion of BY-SS producers raise multiple species of animals. Additionally, there are several K-State facilities that house multiple species. Facilities housing multiple species of livestock present several modeling challenges. First of all, it is very difficult to identify these facilities. Published NASS data does not facilitate estimation of the prevalence of such facilities, and other resources, such as concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) permits, give a limited view. Next, NAADSM does not have a straightforward mechanism for dealing with facilities housing multiple species of animals. For the Updated SSRA, the team assigned a single production type to backyard facilities based on the most prevalent species of livestock. For a few sites on the K-State campus, such as the College of Veterinary 416 Tab le 6.1.4-2: NAADSM Mo del Dataset Format HerdID Herd Updated SSRA M edicine, the team placed multiple production types at the same latitude and longitude. While this will represent the true risk of these animals becoming the first animals infected by releases from the laboratory, it significantly underestimates the true spread of disease between animals at the same location. Co-localization of animals does not increase contact in NAADSM; for example, if goats and cattle have 0 direct contact in the model, co-localizing them will not increase that contact. This presents a real problem for locations such as the College of Veterinary Medicine and backyard facilities. One way to account for facilities with multiple species of animals in NAADSM is to develop custom production types that have increased direct and indirect contact between species at the same location, while maintaining all the other parameters for that production type. So, for example, a cow-calf facility with a couple of goats on site would have to be parameterized using different production types than a backyard facility that had both cows and goats. The number of special production types this approach necessitates quickly escalates. Furthermore, a large-scale data collection effort would be necessary to develop such a complicated system of parameters, which was not feasible for the Updated SSRA. Susceptible Animal Populations The number and specific location of FMD-susceptible animal populations were determined by an extensive data collection effort. This approach accounts for the specific animal populations and densities near the proposed NBAF site, and in the rest of Kansas. The specific populations in other states are described in section 6.1.6. Farm/Facility Sizes and Locations A population file was compiled for Kansas and uploaded to NAADSM in the format shown in Table 6.1.4\u00ad 2. HerdID is a unique number assigned to each facility in the model, and was used for tracking purposes. Herd size is the number of animals in a herd. Lat and Lon are the latitude and longitude of the herd. NAADSM incorporates spatial modeling into its simulations, so it is important to identify farm locations as accurately as possible. Production type describes the species and management practices of that herd. Status indicates the disease state of that herd. S means susceptible; that status was changed to L (latentthe term used in the NAADSM model for animals incubating an infection) when a herd was infected before starting the model. Daysleftinstatus refers to the number of days the herd has left in that disease state; this may be automatically generated by NAADSM as -1 when the population file is uploaded. aNotional latitude and longitude For the 2010 SSRA, modeling files were built with data from CAFO permits, data purchased from the Dunn & Bradstreet (D&B) business database, and interviews with K-State officials and facilities identified 417 Updated SSRA in the local yellow pages. While this approach accounted for almost all of the large facilities, and many medium- sized facilities in the region modeled, it underrepresented small and backyard facilities. For the Updated SSRA, the team again used CAFO permit data, D&B data, and interviews with K-State officials to build the animal population file. Additionally, the team collected high-fidelity data through on-the\u00adground surveys near the NBAF site in Kansas. The team accounted for smaller facilities by also incorporating locations from a dataset developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) using the NASS Agricultural Census data from 2007 [Melius et al., 2006]. In this section the team first describes the data collection effort and then the compilation of multiple datasets into the animal population file used for modeling. Data Collection and Standardization Survey of All Animals within 6.2 Miles of the NBAF Precise data were collected on all animal populations within a 6.2-mile radius of the NBAF site, including the location (lat and lon), herd size and production type of every herd in the region. A 6.2-mile (10 km) radius was selected because this is the size of a quarantine zone according to the Kansas Incident Specific Plan for high-consequence foreign animal diseases. Herds identified for the 2010 SSRA were confirmed and additional herds were identified through interviews and by on-the-ground surveys of the entire area. Producers and K-State officials were interviewed to collect information about production practices in the region. Interviews are described in detail in Appendix A6, Producer Interviews for All Private Facilities within 6.2 Miles of the NBAF and Kansas State University Data Collection. Private Herds (Commercial, Small-Scale and Backyard) Eleven producers were identified in Pottawatomie county and 34 producers were identified in Riley County within a 6.2-mile radius of the NBAF. An additional four pastures were identified that could potentially be used for livestock grazing, but the owners of these properties could not be contacted and the pasture uses could not be determined. Twenty-eight producers agreed to interviews (62%). Only one active swine operation was identified in the area and only one dairy with two cows was identified. The majority of livestock operations were cow-calf beef operations, with a few backgrounder operations. There are no true feedlots in this area. It is estimated that this survey accounted for between 75% and 90% of privately held livestock in this area. None of the producers interviewed were planning to change p \u0011! ! ! Producer Interviews for All Private Facilities within 6.2 Miles of the NBAF). Survey of Kansas State University K-State faculty and staff were interviewed to collect data on all university animal populations. Location data were collected for all thirteen campus-affiliated facilities housing livestock. K-State does not plan to relocate any of their operations when the NBAF opens [Odde, 2011]. While many K-State facilities could clearly be assigned a production type based on interviews, animals in campus herds are likely to have greater contact than those in other herds of the same production type due to the use of the herds for education. Furthermore, observation and reporting of disease is likely to happen faster for some of 418 Updated SSRA these herds because of the level of education of the herd caretakers: many are veterinarians. In the case of the veterinary hospital and large animal research facility, backyard production types were chosen to represent animals at the veterinary clinic based on how often they came into contact with other people or animals regardless of the associated population size (high indirect contact). For detailed information please see Appendix A6, Kansas State University Data Collection. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) Regulations set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) require that large concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) obtain permits for wastewater management. Permits are legally required for facilities housing 1000+ cattle or cow-calf pairs, 700+ dairy cattle, 2,500+ swine over 55 lbs, or 10,000+ swine under 55 lbs. Updated datasets for these permits were obtained from each state in the modeled region for the Updated SSRA. Generally, records contained all information necessary to model these facilities in NAADSM including: location, production type, and number of animals. As a result, CAFOs provide a comprehensive list of all large animal livestock operations in each state. A detailed description of how data from CAFO permits was interpreted to create locations for NAADSM can be found in Appendix A6, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) Permit Data Collection and Standardization. Dunn & Bradstreet (D&B) D&B is a company that compiles information about the revenue generating activities and geographical locations of corporations and businesses. Business listings for Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, D\u0011 E data to be easily sorted by type or searched by keyword. D&B records provide location and production type information, but number of animals had to be extrapolated. Obtaining the D&B data for Iowa would have incurred additional cost and the extent of the CAFO records in Iowa enabled the Updated SSRA team to capture almost all premises that would have been listed in the D&B database for this state. To assign a production type to each facility, the Updated SSRA team used the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code, a government classification for businesses based on their primary revenue generating activity, provided with each record. Additionally, targeted word searches were used when SIC codes failed to provide a translatable production type. SIC codes provided by D&B were used as the basis for classifying facilities as dairies, feedlots, cow-calf facilities, swine producers, or goat and sheep producers. Facilities with non-livestock SIC codes, but with livestock mentioned in their business descriptions were identified through targeted word searches, and classified as backyard operations for the purpose of the modeling. Backyard operations were further classified as beef operations, swine operations, or as small ruminant operations raising sheep and goats. Further detail on this processing of data from D&B can be found in Appendix A6, Dunn & Bradstreet Data Collection and Standardization. The process of assigning a number of animals to each facility is described below, in the Population file creation section. 419 Updated SSRA LLNL Animal Population Dataset In 2007, LLNL developed a dataset of farms (including production type, size and location) computed from data in the NASS 2007 Agricultural Survey. This dataset improved upon a previous dataset created with 2002 NASS data by taking into account geographic features when simulating farm locations [Melius population files. This dataset was used to help account for all the small and medium sized facilities not identified through CAFO permit datasets, D&B datasets, and surveys. Twenty-eight separate production types were included in the original LLNL 2007 dataset; these were translated into the Updated SSRA production types (see Appendix A6, LLNL Dataset Standardization). Prior to using LLNL 2007 for the Updated SSRA, the team evaluated how closely the simulated dataset matched the NASS 2007 data on which it was based. This was achieved by comparing the total animals and facilities in the NASS and LLNL datasets for three counties in four of the states modeled. In most cases, the LLNL dataset matched the NASS results within 95% of the NASS totals. The team determined it was sufficiently accurate, and probably the best available dataset of its type, so it was used to provide supplementary locations for the Updated SSRA modeling files. The full analysis of the LLNL dataset can be found in Appendix A6, LLNL Dataset Assessment. Population file creation The LLNL, CAFO, D&B, and survey data were ultimately merged into a single population file. A detailed description of the creation of the NAADSM modeling population file for Kansas can be found in Appendix A6, Modeling File Compilation. The datasets were merged as follows: 1. The D&B and CAFO datasets were compared based on geographical coordinates and duplicate facilities were removed from the D&B dataset. 2. D&B facilities and CAFO facilities were removed from within the dense downtown areas of the top ten most populous cities using R [Team, 2011b] to account for facilities with offices, not animals at these locations. 3. The D&B and LLNL Kansas datasets were divided into 12 regions using a 3 \u00d7 4 grid covering the state. Within each region and for each production type, D&B facilities were rank- ordered by revenue. Similarly, LLNL facilities were rank-ordered by herd size. Each facility was assigned a corresponding percentile based on revenue and herd size, respectively. Each D&B facility was matched with the LLNL facility of the same percentile. The locations (latitude and longitude) of the LLNL facilities were replaced with the matching D&B locations so that the largest LLNL facility's location was replaced with that of the D&B facility with the highest revenue. BY-SS facilities for both LLNL and D&B were handled separately. 4. BY-SS facilities in the D&B dataset were designated based on SIC code; word searches identified those facilities whose primary SIC code was designated as a plant crop but whose description included livestock production. Because the revenues associated with these facilities were not generated as a direct product of animal sales, the use of revenue was considered an inappropriate means of LLNL coordinate replacement. Thus, LLNL and D&B BY-SS facilities were geographically separated into 12 regions and LLNL facility coordinates 420 Updated SSRA were randomly replaced with D&B coordinates within the same region. This process maintained the production type and population count in a geographical area, while replacing simulated geographical coordinates with verified geographical locations. 5. CAFO operations were divided into two subsets: small CAFOs and large CAFOs. Small CAFOs were permitted facilities that fell below the legal cutoff for that operation type; all large CAFOs were at or above the permitted population. For example, if all dairies over 700 head are required to obtain a CAFO, a dairy with 600 cows that obtained a CAFO permit would be in the small CAFO subset. A dairy with 750 cows would be in the large CAFO subset. 6. For production types with CAFO requirements (this excluded BY-SS production types by definition), all facilities that were above the specified size requiring a permit were removed from the interim LLNL-D&B merged dataset and replaced with the CAFO large dataset. For example, all dairies with 700 cows or more were removed from the LLNL dataset and replaced with the Dairy CAFO large subset. Every dairy in Kansas over 700 head is legally required to obtain a CAFO permit, so the Dairy CAFO large subset should include every dairy in the state of Kansas with 700 cows or more. 7. For the small CAFO subset, the small CAFO subset and the merged file were each divided into 12 regions formed roughly from a 3 \u00d7 4 grid covering the state. Within each region, a LLNL facility was removed and replaced by a CAFO facility with the same production type and herd size from that region. If there were no exact matches, the size requirement for facilities larger than 85 animals was relaxed from an exact match to a \u00b1 1% range, \u00b1 5% range, \u00b1 10% range, and finally a \u00b1 20% range, if needed. The size requirement for facilities smaller than 85 animals was relaxed from an exact match to a \u00b11 range, \u00b15 range, \u00b110 range, and finally a \u00b120 range. The size ranges of specific production types were ignored so that, for example, a CAFO Feedlot(S) facility with a herd size close to the Feedlot(L) cutoff could be matched with either a Feedlot(S) or Feedlot(L) LLNL facility. Any CAFO facilities not able to be matched even at a \u00b120 or \u00b120% size range were allowed to remain in the final dataset without a match. 8. The location (latitude and longitude) of LLNL facilities that overlapped with CAFO and D&B facilities were shifted. An area was approximated for each CAFO and D&B facility based on the NASS 2007 Census State Data. Any LLNL facilities falling within these areas were moved a distance equivalent to the diameter of the typical farm of that production type. The LLNL facilities were moved in a direction towards the center of the state to prevent facilities being moved into adjacent states. 9. All facilities within 6.2 miles of the proposed NBAF site were removed and replaced with the facilities identified by surveys and K-State interviews. Results The number of livestock facilities and animals identified across the modeled region through evaluation and reconciliation of all the datasets are provided in Table 6.1.4-3. The analysis of this population file is discussed in Appendix A6, Analysis of Final Population Files vs. NASS and LLNL Files. The analysis includes a comparison of animal and facility totals versus LLNL and NASS census. 421 Table 6.1.4 -3.

Each period is defined by a probability function that specifies the probability that a herd will spend a length of time (in days) in that disease state. For example, a triangular distribution for the latent period of (1,2,3) would indicate that a herd could spend between 1 and 3 days latently infected, with the most likely period in this disease state being two days. The actual length of each disease period for each infected herd is determined stochastically. Animals die in NAADSM only as defined by user-specified destruction-based control strategies. Although an entire herd is characterized by a single disease state, a function is available that defines the prevalence of infection within a herd on any given day (the percent of the herd that is infected). Herd-Level Disease Periods Animal-level disease distributions were obtained from Mardones [2010] for latent, subclinical, and clinical disease periods. The clinical period was extrapolated from these data (see Appendix A6, Extrapolation of Clinical Period from Mardones Disease Phase Durations, for detailed method). The immune period was obtained from USDA 2011, who provided the following evidence basis: \"Eighty percent of the cattle reported by Cunliffe (1963) [Cunliffe & Graves, 1963] retained immunity over a period of four and one-half years. Sixty percent of the cattle reported by Moonen et al. [2004] retained immunity for 609 days following inoculation with FMD virus. 422 Updated SSRA Swine periods [Bachrach, 1968], [Cunliffe, 1962] than cattle; however, unlike the studies reported for cattle, there are no long-term studies available in the peer- reviewed literature that define the duration of the immune period for swine. Given this limitation, the Weibull distribution was chosen as an approximation of the duration of the immune period in swine in order to account for their shorter immune period as compared to cattle. There are no long-term studies available in the peer-reviewed literature that define the duration of the immune period for small ruminants. Given this limitation, it was assumed that the duration of the immune period in small ruminants is roughly equivalent to that of swine. Additionally, in order to account for an increase in the quantity of antibodies detected in sheep after vaccination [Patil et al., 2002] a Gaussian distribution was chosen as an approximation of the duration of the immune period in small ruminants\" [USDA 2011]. Herd-level disease phases were estimated using the within-herd model (version 0.9.6), a model that captures animal-level variation and within-herd dynamics developed by Colorado Sta Animal Population Health Institute [Reeves, 2011]. The probability distributions for cattle (Figures 6.1.4\u00ad 1 through 6.1.4-4), swine (Figures 6.1.4-5 through 6.1.4-8), and small ruminants (Figures 6.1.4-9 through 6.1.4-12) are plotted to show herd level distributions. These figures demonstrate the importance of developing herd-level parameters. Herd size can change disease phase duration significantly, especially for large feedlots. The within-herd model, input parameters, and methods used to develop herd-level disease phases are described in Appendix A6, Within-Herd Model Generated Parameters. The herd-level disease phase distributions can also be found in this appendix. 423 Updated SSRA 424 0.35 0.45 0.4 0 5 10 Probability Density 0.3 0.25 0.2 Beef (BY- SS) CowCalf Dairy Feedlot (L) 0.15 Feedlot (S) 0.1 0.05 0 Days Figure 6.1.4-1: Kansas Cattle Latent Disease Phase 0.14 0 50 100 150 200 0.12Probability Density Beef (BY- SS) CowCalf Dairy Feedlot (L) Feedlot (S) 0.1 0.08 0.06 0.04 0.02 0 Days F igure 6.1.4-3: Kansas Cattle Clinical Disease Phase 0.8 0 5 10 0.7 0.6 Beef (BY- SS)Probability Density 0.5 CowCalf 0.4 Feedlot (L) 0.3 0.2 Feedlot (S) Dairy 0.1 0 Days Figure 6.1.4-2: Kansas Cattle Subclinical Disease Phase 0.0025 0 500 1000 1500 2000 Probability Density 0.002 0.0015 0.001 0.0005 0 Days Figure 6.1.4-4: Kansas Cattle Immune Period Updated SSRA 425 1 Swine (S) Swine (L) Swine (BY- SS) 0.8 0 5 10 Probability Density 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 Days Figure 6.1.4-5: Kansas Swine Latent Disease Phase 0.1 0 20 40 60 Probability Density 0.08 Swine (S) 0.06 0.04 Swine (L) 0.02 Swine (BY SS)0 Days F igure 6.1.4-7: Kansas Swine Clinical Disease Phase 1.2 0 5 10 Probability Density 1 0.8 Swine (S) 0.6 0.4 Swine (L) 0.2 Swine (BY- SS) 0 Days Figure 6.1.4-6: Kansas Swine Subclinical Disease Phase 0.0025 Probability Density0.002 0 500 1000 1500 2000 0.0015 0.001 0.0005 0 Days F igure 6.1.4-8: Kansas Swine Immune Disease Phase \u00ad Updated SSRA 426 0.3 0.25 0 10 20 Probability Density0.2 Goats 0.15 Sheep 0.1 0.05 SmRu (BY- SS) 0 Figure 6.1.4-9: Kansas Small Ruminants Latent Disease Phase 0.2 0.15 0 20 40 Probability Density Goats 0.1 Sheep SmRu (BY- SS) 0.05 0 Days F igure 6.1.4-11: Kansas Small Ruminants Clinical Disease Phase 0.6 0 5 10 Probability Density 0.5 0.4 Goats 0.3 0.2 SmRu (BY- SS) 0.1 Sheep 0 Days Figure 6.1.4-10: Kansas Small Ruminants Subclinical Disease Phase 0.005 Probability 0.002 Small Ruminants 0.001 0 Days Figure Small Ruminants Immune Disease Phase Updated SSRA Within-Unit Prevalence The proportion of animals infected in a herd is expressed by the within-unit prevalence function. This function is used by NAADSM when determining if an infected animal is shipped from an infected herd to a susceptible herd. Within-unit prevalence functions were calculated for each production type using output from the within-herd model (Figures 6.1.4-13 through 6.1.4-15).

Direct contact accounts for spread that occurs through shipments of animals from one facility to another. Indirect contact accounts for humans and equipment that come in contact with an infected herd and then move to an uninfected herd, where they may spread disease. Airborne and local area spread account for airborne spread and mechanical transmission through fomites that cannot be controlled by quarantine. Direct Contact Rate For direct contact, the user defines which production types have contact with each other and what disease states are capable of spreading disease by direct contact. For each production type combination, a movement rate is selected by sampling the number of shipments from a poisson distribution with the mean defined by the direct contact rate. The direct contact rate reflects the mean number of shipments that occur between each pair of production types. Additionally, a distance distribution defines the range of distances traveled by shipments moving between each production type pairing. USDA 2009 parameters served as the basis for the Updated SSRA direct contact parameters, however some parameters were modified to best reflect available data and to account for differences in the modeling approaches used by the Updated SSRA and USDA 2009. Additionally, contact parameters were developed to describe BY-SS producer contact. Direct Contact Increase for Movement Through Sales Barns Direct contact simulates the direct movement of animals between farms as shipments. When the parameters were originally developed, it was assumed that one shipment out of a facility was equivalent to one shipment into another. This would be true if farmers sold their shipments directly to the next facility, or if they sold through sales barns in single lots. According to SMEs, in Kansas about 90% of cow-calf sales occur through sales barns, and some producers sell multiple lots in a single sale. The Updated SSRA team analyzed the records of 500 sales from two markets that listed the producer for individual lots to determine the number of lots typically sold by a single producer at a sale. A single cow-calf operation sells between one and seven lots at a sales barn at a time. According to SME interviews, at most sales these lots would go to multiple buyers. Around 65% of cow-calf operations sell in a single lot, 25% sell in two lots and the percent of producers selling three to seven lots is evenly distributed. Parameters which were modified to account for increased shipments through sales barns are noted with a superscript B in the following parameter tables. Here is an example of the calculation the team applied to cow-calf operations: lots*2%)]) The small sample size of market sales records is a weakness of this approach. 429 Updated SSRA Direct Contact Reduction for Out- of-State Movement The Updated SSRA models each state individually and accounts for movements between states using an approach described in Section 6.1.5, while USDA 2009 modeled a multi-state region using a single parameter set and a single population file. Contact rates were based on shipment from a facility to other facilities, regardless of the state in which the destination facility fell. The Updated SSRA models each state individually and accounts for movements between states using a separate approach (see section 6.1.5). To avoid inflating contact by double counting out- of-state contacts, the Updated SSRA team D! eflects in-state animal shipments using data from certificates of veterinary inspection (see Appendix A6, Direct Contact Reduction for Out- of-State Movement). The final direct contact parameters for USDA 2009 production types are listed in Appendix A6, Direct Contact Parameters. An example is provided below describing cow-calf direct contact parameters. Direct contact parameters for BY-SS facilities were developed for the Updated SSRA and parameter development is described using the Beef BY-SS production type as an example. The BY-SS production type direct contact rates are also provided in Appendix A6, Backyard Small-Scale Production Type Direct Contact Parameters, following USDA production type parameters. Example: Cow-Calf Direct contact parameters for cow-calf facilities were developed for USDA 2009 through SME interviews and literature reviews (see Appendix A6, Direct Contact Rate and Distance Distribution Parameters for more detail). Parameters describing direct contact between cow-calf and BY-SS facilities were developed from BY- SS producer interviews (described in Appendix A6, Direct Contact Rate and Distance Distribution Parameters). Producers were asked how often they purchased new animals and from where they obtained those animals. Animals were often directly purchased from another facility, but in the event that animals (typically calves) were purchased at market, they were assumed to originate from a cow- calf facility. Almost all animals originated from within the state. The mean number of purchases per year per producer was calculated and then multiplied by the total number of each type of backyard facility and divided by the total number of cow-calf facilities. For example, there were 14 shipments sold from cow-calf operations to the 18 beef backyard producers interviewed, which averaged to 0.78 shipments to each of those 18 beef backyard facilities. This value was then adjusted for the total number of backyard beef (3,724) and cow-calf (22,929) producers in Kansas and converted, by dividing by 365, from a yearly value to a daily value of 0.00035 shipments per day (Table 6.1.4-4). 430 Table 6.1.4 -4: Direct Contact Originating from Cow -Calf Operations Production Types Kansas mean Shipments Parameter baseline direct per year source contact rate - - Cow Calf to Cow Calf 0.0099a,b,c 3.6 USDA 2009 modified by Updated SSRA team - Cow Calf to Dairy 7.0E -06a,b,c .0026 USDA 2009 modified by Updated SSRA team - Cow Calf to Feedlot (S) 0.0051a,b,c 1.9 USDA 2009 modified by Updated SSRA team - Cow Calf to Feedlot (L ) 0.0076a,b,c 2.8 USDA 2009 modified by Updated SSRA team - Cow Calf to Sheep 0 0 USDA 2009 - Cow Calf to Goats 0 0 USDA 2009 - Cow Calf to Swine (S) 0 0 USDA 2009 - Cow Calf to Swine (L) 0 0 USDA 2009 - - Cow Calf to Beef (BY SS) 0.00035 .13 Updated SSRA team - - Cow Calf to Small Ruminants (BY SS) 0 0 Updated SSRA team - - Cow Calf to Swine (BY SS) 0 0 Updated SSRA team Updated SSRA aUSDA 2009 contact rates were modified by K-State SME bContact rates were increased to account for the fact that many cow-calf operations will send one shipment of animals to a sales barn that will then be sold in multiple lots to multiple buyers (described in direct contact introduction) cContact rates were modified to account for interstate movement Example 2: Beef (Backyard-Small-Scale) Parameters describing direct contact originating from BY-SS were developed from producer interviews (interviews are described in Appendix A6, Direct Contact Rate and Distance Distribution Parameters). For BY-SS producers each animal sold or purchased was considered a single shipment. When answers were provided in number ranges, the mean value of the range was used. For example, if a producer purchased two to four animals per year, he was considered to have purchased three shipments of animals. Producers were asked how often they sold animals and to whom they sold their animals. Animals were sometimes sent to slaughter and sometimes sold through markets. Animals sold straight to slaughter were excluded. Most producers were able to indicate whether animals sold through market went to slaughter or finishing. The destination was assumed to be feedlots for most cattle sold through markets. If the producer specified other destinations through markets, such as 4-H operations or other small farms, beef BY-SS facilities were selected as the receiving production type.

The same method was used when the destination of backyard swine or small ruminants was not specified between the various small and large swine or goat and sheep locations. All producers surveyed were from Kansas and shipments from these farms were assumed to stay within the state, because insufficient data was available. The mean number of sales per year per producer was calculated. This mean was then multiplied by the total number of beef BY-SS facilities and divided by the total number of each production type. For example, there were 25.25 shipments sold from the 18 beef BY-SS producers interviewed to small feedlots, which averaged to 1.4 shipments sold by each of the 18 beef BY-SS facilities. This value was then adjusted for the total number of beef BY-SS facilities (3,724) and small feedlot facilities (2,485) in Kansas and converted, by dividing by 365, from a yearly value to a daily value of 0.00576 shipments per day. These contact values were not adjusted for backyard facilities in other states, nor were they adjusted for the complications of market sales because shipment sizes were likely to be so small that they would only be sold as single lots. Distance Distribution The distance distribution function defines the distance that animals are shipped, once NAADSM determines that a shipment should be made based on the contact rate. This parameter is a probability distribution of shipping distances. USDA 2009 functions are all BetaPERT functions, which are defined by a minimum, mode and maximum distance that a shipment can travel (Table 6.1.4-6). Distance distributions for USDA 2009 were established using the same sources as the direct contact parameters described in the previous section. For the Updated SSRA, all USDA 2009 distance distribution functions were modified to increase the maximum distance traveled. This change was made based on sales barn records that indicated that animals were shipped farther than the original distance described by USDA 432 Updated SSRA 2009 parameters. For example, many cow-calf operations in the northeast corner of Kansas near the NBAF ship animals diagonally across the longest part of the state to the southwest corner of Kansas. A new maximum distance, 752 km, was chosen because it allows all farms in Kansas to contact each other.

Producers were asked the distance animals traveled from purchase location and how far their animals traveled to their destination farm when they were sold. Producers typically answered with a range or a single point location, although some provided a range and a most common distance. Distance estimates were grouped by production type pair-assigned for the purpose of calculating the mean direct contract rate (for example, all shipments from Beef BY- SS to Feedlot (L)). Each distance estimated was weighted depending on how many shipments a year of that type that producer pair sent or received, and then they were used to estimate a distance function to represent all shipments for that combination as described in Appendix A6, Backyard and Small-Scale Distance Distributions. Distance distributions are also provided in this appendix. Shipping Delays USDA advised that the shipping delay used in all current versions of NAADSM (NAADSM 3.2 and prior) should be set to newer versions of NAADSM [Forde-Folle, 2011]. 433 Updated SSRA Indirect contact rate The indirect contact rate in NAADSM is used to indicate the average number of contacts that are gene ! !!D and a susceptible herd. Unlike direct contact, only subclinical and clinical herds can be a source of infection. For simplicity sake, in this section Indirect contact data Indirect contact rates for all production types except BY-SS were from USDA 2009. An example of indirect contact rates for cow-calf operation is provided in Table 6.1.4-7. A full list of indirect contact rates and the evidence basis provided by USDA 2009 for each of the livestock species can be found in Appendix section A6.2.18. Updated versions of the data and templates used to develop indirect contact parameters for USDA 2009 were provided by Dr. Mike Sanderson, Professor of Epidemiology and Beef Production, K-State. These templates were used in developing BY-SS indirect contact parameters to insure consistency in parameter development. Table 6.1.4 -7: Example Indirect Contact Values for Contacts Originating at Cow -Calf Operations From USDA 2009 Production Type Indirect Contact Rate (contacts/day) Cow -calf to Cow -Calf 0.02 Cow -Calf to Dairy 0.104 Cow -Calf to Feedlot (S) 0.147 Cow -Calf to Feedlot (L) 1.152 Cow -Calf to Swine (S) 0.004 Cow -Calf to Swine (L) 0.035 Cow -Calf to Sheep 0.005 Cow -Calf to Goats 0.005 Backyard and Small-Scale Indirect Contact BY-SS indirect contact values were developed by the USSRA team. Data on indirect contact was obtained through producer interviews, which included questions about contact with indirect fomites such as veterinarians, and neighbors (see Appendix section A6.2.18.4 for details on backyard producer interviews). Producers responded with how many times a year they may have had a visit from a particular fomite (Table 6.1.4-8). 434 Table 6.1.4 -8: Average Vis its Per Year Between Backyard Facilities and Each Professional Service Provider (Indirect Fomite) Fomite Beef (BY -SS) Swine(BY -SS) 0.88 1.21 Feed Truck 1.83 0.5 0.86 Drug Sales 2.5 0 0 Neighbors 23.68 0 142.5 Total Vis its/Year 29.08 1.38 144.57 Updated SSRA The approach used to calculate the BY-SS indirect contact parameters was based on the approach used D! matrix used by the USDA 2009 team. According to the original matrix, values were estimated for the percent of visits each fomite made to the respective production type, (e.g. veterinarians in Kansas make 68% of visits to cow-calf ops.). In other words, if a veterinarian made 100 visits in a year to various operations, 68 of those visits were to cow-calf operations. These values, based on expert opinion, were intended to account for the fact that some indirect fomites may be more likely to visit some production types than others. Similar values were not obtained from the backyard producers interviewed. However, since backyard facilities were substantially smaller than other production type facilities, we assumed that the fomites would most likely spend the least amount of time there. Table 6.1.4-9 provides the estimated percentages of visits by each fomite to each backyard production type. The backyard values were selected according to the assumption of minimal contact. It should be noted that these values were only modified in the calculations for purposes of adapting the indirect contact method for use with backyard facilities. These modifications were not applied to the existing USDA 2009 indirect contact rates used for all other production types because insufficient information was available to redevelop indirect contact rates for all production types. With the exception of two values, 1% of all fomite visits was assumed for any contact numbers greater than zero. Since the total percent of veterinary visits to goats and sheep was 2% according to the data provided in the template, the value for the three ruminant categories was divided equally yielding 0.66% for each of these categories. Another value inconsistent with the 1% rule was the percent of neighbor visits to Beef BY-SS operations. Since the number of neighbor visits according to backyard producers was higher than the number of visits to cow- calf and dairy operations in the template, the percentage of visits from neighbors was matched to the percentage values selected for the other cattle production types (cow-calf & dairy) since the percentage across neighbor visits did not add to 100% indicating that neighbors that visit a backyard operations may be different than those neighbors that would visit large-scale operations. 435 Updated SSRA Tab le 6.1.4 -9: Estimated Percent of Visits of Each Fomite Type to the Backyard Facility* Fomite Beef BY -SS Swine (BY -SS) SR (BY -SS) Veterinarian 1 1 0.67 Feed Truck 1 1 1 Drug Sales 1 - - Neighbor 50 - - Average % of Visits 13 1 .8 Normalized % of 8.5 .65 0.54 Visits * These values were subtracted from the largest of the percentage within fomite type across production types. A dash indicates that information was not available. All fomite visits were summed, yielding a total number of visits for each production type (Table 6.1.4-8). Similar to the original indirect contact method, the percent visits spent by fomites at each backyard facility was averaged and normalized to one across all the production types. The sum of all indirect visits for the destination production type was multiplied by the visit proportions for the origin production type and converted to a daily contact rate. For example, the number of indirect contacts per year from a beef BY-SS to Swine BY-SS would be the total fomite visits/year for the swine BY-SS (1.38) multiplied by the normalized proportion of all fomite visits to beef BY-SS (0.085). The yearly indirect contact rate (0.1178) would then be converted to a daily indirect contact rate (0.000323).

The function used is: BetaPERT (1.6, 40.2, 160.9) , where 1.6 km is the minimum distance traveled, 40.2 km is the mode and 160.9 km is the maximum. Probability of Infection Given Exposure for Indirect Contact for All States The parameters describing the probability of animal infection given indirect contact with a contaminated fomite were taken from USDA 2011. The following excerpt describes parameter development: \"Laboratory transmission data were obtained from published studies involving experimental infection with FMD. In cases where no empirical disease transmission data were published, the probability of disease transmission was assumed to be 1.0 (100%). The data collected from the literature were used to calculate the probability of infection given exposure for each production type combination. To account for a variety of biosecurity measures implemented by various livestock sectors, an average reduction factor was calculated using published National Animal Health Monitoring Systems (NAHMS) data. This reduction factor was then multiplied to the probability of indirect disease transmission for each livestock sector (cattle, swine, & small ruminants).\" USDA 2011 parameters were developed using a different set of production types than the production types used for the Updated SSRA model. It was generally obvious which USDA 2011 pairing was equivalent to the Updated SSRA production type pairing. In some cases, multiple USDA 2011 production type combinations had the same probability of infection given exposure; this simplified identification of an appropriate match to an Updated SSRA production type combination. Table 6.1.4-11 shows a few examples of probability of infection given exposure for indirect contacts. A full table can be found in Appendix A6, Probability of Infection Given Exposure for Indirect Contact. In this table, both production ! 437 Updated SSRA Shipping Delays USDA advised that the shipping delay used in all current versions of NAADSM (NAADSM 3.2 and prior) deprecated feature that will not exist in newer versions of NAADSM [Forde-Folle, 2011]. Effect of Movement Control on Both Direct and Indirect Contact Universal movement control was used for epidemiological modeling because no group has developed a modification to NAADSM that enables zones to reflect the manner in which they would be implemented as described by various SMEs contacted for this assessment. While all experts consulted agreed that zoned movement control would be used during an FMD outbreak, no group has developed a modification to NAADSM that enables the modeling of zones that reflect how they will be implemented in reality. The universal movement control parameters are estimated based upon several lines of evidence. In the 2010 SSRA, movement control was considered to be perfect in the baseline studies (no contact with infected premises any time after the outbreak was announced). The 2010 SSRA examined, through sensitivity analysis, the effect of imperfect movement controls that allowed a few percent of the movement to proceed before the outbreak was detected. Even though imperfect movement control was explored in sensitivity analysis, the 2010 SSRA was strongly urged to consider movement control strategies that are imperfect due to the difficulty of controlling movement after an outbreak. A stronger evidence basis supports the Updated SSRA movement control parameters. Phone interviews were conducted with representatives of the Departments of Agriculture of Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, and Iowa. For both direct and indirect movement, the representatives were asked to estimate the ability of the state to control movement of direct contacts (animals) and indirect contacts (fomites, i.e., people and inanimate objects that could spread FMD) over time. In particular, the movement over time after the declaration of an FMD outbreak. It was assumed that movement would be controlled through the use of zones, so estimates describe the restriction of travel from within to outside of a 10 km zone around an infected farm. Most states would be able to set up control zones around only a few infected premises using their own resources (up to five premises according to one state); these resources will be supplemented with federal resources from the very beginning of the outbreak. For some of the larger outbreaks modeled, due to the number of premises infected when the outbreak is detected, even with federal resources, the control of zones around all infected premises would be challenging. It was suggested by at least one expert that responders would need to get creative with road blockades, using whatever they could find (e.g., semi trucks, farm equipment, hay bales). Individual state responses are not provided because this information is considered sensitive as it zoned movement control estimates are plotted in Figure 6.1.4-16. 438 Percent movement allowed 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 Day since index case discovered Direct Indirect Updated SSRA Figure 6.1.4-16: Average Estimated Reduction in Direct Contact and Indirect Contact for One 10-km Zone Around an FMD Infected Farm According to Interviews with State Officials In addition to any enforced stop movement put into effect, there will likely be a de facto secondary level of stop movement. There is a widespread belief amongst the experts the Updated SSRA team interviewed that there will be self-enforcement within the producer community of any stop movement request. Farmers will understand the danger an FMD outbreak presents to their livelihood and follow any publicized recommendation to mitigate an outbreak. Furthermore, many experts believe producers will report their neighbors if they witness non-compliance. Next, direct contact will be significantly reduced because there will be nowhere to send the animals. Sales barns and slaughter yards will likely especially from impacted areas. The contribution of these efforts is difficult to quantify. Given these data sources, movement control parameters had to be estimated that were applicable not just to zones but to all locations in the state. Once disease is detected in any production type, if the movement control variables in NAADSM are parameterized in a similar manner for all production type combinations, movement of all livestock (no matter their production type) will be restricted according to the relational function (reduction in contact rate over time) entered by the user. So, the Updated SSRA team had to develop a movement control parameter that accounted for localized, enforced zones and less effective, voluntary movement restriction. For this reason, the time required to drop the amount of contact to a minimum was extended by approximately two fold over the state estimate for zones (in Figure 6.1.4-17, the minimum indirect contact rate is reached in 20 days whereas the minimum indirect contact rate is reached in only five). This modest level of universal direct movement control is only possible because of the extent of self-policing predicted, with producers acting in their own self-interest. The day- to-day activity surrounding a premises will not simply cease just because an infection is found elsewhere in the state. For these reasons, the low-point of indirect movement projected for zones by 439 Updated SSRA state officials was increased by half and the time to get to this point was dropped by a factor of 10 to create the universal indirect contact movement control function. Percent movement allowed 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 Day since index case discovered Direct Indirect Figure 6.1.4-17: Universal Movement Control Functions Entered in NAADSM In summary, the universal movement control parameters aimed to account for the fact that the majority of farms in the model would not be placed on mandatory movement restriction during an outbreak. Balancing this effect is the fact that there is an awareness of the seriousness of FMD in areas where livestock production is the primary industry and self-policing and control will be the primary force in preventing indirect and direct contacts. The exact effectiveness of movement control in a large FMD outbreak in the US is impossible to predict, and for this reason the Updated SSRA team explored the effect of different assumptions in the cost-benefit analysis (section 6.3).The team used values for movement control that are likely conservative because of the incentive of the community itself to prevent the movement of infected animals and vehicles. This uncertainty is yet another factor undermining the interpretation of epidemiological modeling results as part of an absolute estimate of the impact and extent of FMD outbreaks. Instead, because of this uncertainty, a more robust use of the modeling data is to understand the relative impact and extent of outbreaks compared across various starting locations, or in the presence/absence of a control measure. Airborne and Local Spread Airborne and local area spread parameters were taken from USDA 2011 (Table 6.1.4-12). These parameters describe airborne spread of FMD virus, a phenomena which has been documented to play a role in previous outbreaks. Additionally, these parameters aim to capture some of the local area spread that cannot be controlled through quarantine, for example spread across fence lines or spread of fomites farm- to-farm by rodents. This evidence was provided by USDA: 440 Table 6.1.4 -12: Airborne and Local Area Spread Parameters from USDA 2011 Production type Probability of spread between Range of Airborne transport delay combination two herds of average size direction in days located 1 km apart All swine to all cattle 0.1 0-360\u00b0 0 production types Swine to small 0.01 0-360\u00b0 0 ruminants 0.008 0-360\u00b0 0 All other production type combinations Updated SSRA \"!f ter movement controls had been imposed in Cumbria, U.K. during the 2001 outbreak, disease spread continued. This continued spread may have been due to direct fence line contact between contiguous premises, spread by fomites or illegal movements of animals, or close proximity aerosol spread. Disease spread that occurred over short distances (< 3km) where no source was identified was referred to as local spread. A study using data from the 2001 Cumbria outbreak estimated the cumulative 17-day risk of infection to be 14% at a distance of 1.5km and 3% at a distance of 3km after movement controls had been imposed [Taylor et al., 2004]. Therefore the daily risk of local spread for all other production type combinations was estimated to be 0.008 (0.14/17 = 0.008).\" [USDA 2011] Using a database of thousands of real weather conditions from Manhattan, Kansas, the Updated SSRA tea m modeled the downwind uptake of FMDv by cows from a release at the NBAF. These data show that downwind concentration (and therefore risk) is not biased in any particular direction which corroborates U D! -18). Figure 6.1.4-18: Distribution of Virus from a Location Near Manhattan, Kansas, Using Local Weather Conditions 441 Updated SSRA The Updated SSRA team departed from USDA 2011 parameters in that the team modeled an expo D transport model shows that the downwind concentration of infection decreases by an order of magnitude for each doubling of distance [Sorensen et al., 2000]. Garner \u0012 D model shows that downwind risk of infection decreases exponentially if the atmosphere is unstable or the source is several animals and linearly for relatively stable point sources (non-point sources will be the greater contributor to risk of disease spread from sources around the NBAF) [Garner & Cannon, 1995]. Lastly, transport modeling by the Updated SSRA at the NBAF shows that uptake (by livestock) of FMDv, irrespective of wind direction, drops exponentially with distance given real weather conditions in Manhattan, Kansas (Figure 6.1.4-19). Figure 6.1.4-19: The Mean PFU Uptake by Cows Decreases Exponentially with Distance Irrespective of Wind Directions This phenomenon is due to the fact that the chance that a particular location is hit with the aerosol decreases as a function of the square of the distance. A potential criticism of utilizing an exponentially decreasing aerosol risk curve comes from probit susceptibility analysis. Conventional probit analysis suggests that as the dose decreases much lower than the ID 50, the probability of infection drops more slowly as a function of dose. This phenomenon may partially counteract the exponential decrease in concentration and probability of uptake. However, doses less than one virus particle will pose no risk of infection in reality. Furthermore, the probability of infection will determine the probability of inhaling at least one infectious particle. Therefore, doses much lower than the ID 50 are not significant contributors to risk; this fact mitigates the aforementioned counteractive effects of susceptibility enabling the maintenance of the exponential shape of the aerosol risk curve. The evidence basis for all other airborne and local area spread parameters was provided by USDA 20 11: 442 Updated SSRA \"Studies that have estimated the maximum distance of spread of airborne virus from different source species have yielded varying results ([Donaldson et al., 2001]; [Garner & Alexanderson, This variation is largely due to differences in excretion rates among virus strains. Studies that based their estimates on type O strains have found that the maximum distance of spread was less than 10km with swine as the source, and less than 1km when other species were the source [Donaldson et al., 2001]; [Sanson, 2000]. Cattle and sheep were the only recipient species that were at risk of airborne infection with type O strains at a distance beyond 1km. Studies using the C Noville strain estimated that the maximum distance of airborne spread was up to 300km with swine as the source and that large cattle herds or sheep herds (>1000 head) were capable of infecting cattle at distances up to 3km [Sorenson, 2000]. Because type O strains are more prevalent worldwide than type C strains, the estimates based on the type O strains were used to inform parameters for this study [USDA, 2007 ]. The minimum virus concentration threshold needed for airborne infection of cattle is approximately 10 times higher than for sheep resulting in a probability of airborne infection parameter that is 10 times higher for cattle production types [Donaldson et al., 2001]. In the absence of geographically specific wind data the risk of airborne spread is assumed to be equal in all directions.\" Given these studies and inputs, the Updated SSRA team used an exponential decline but took all other values from USDA 2011 . Detection rting an Notably, these two functions operate on different time scales. The observation function changes as a function of the number of days an individual herd has been showing clinical signs, while the reporting function changes as a function of the number of days since the first infected herd in the population was detected. The problem with this approach is that both observation and reporting behavior change after the first infected herd is detected in the population. If the same observation function is used to represent observation behavior before and after an outbreak is declared, the function will either under- represent or over-represent the observation. This will have a significant effect on the initial detection of outbreak or the detection as the outbreak progresses, which in turn will have a serious impact on outbreak severity. e both observation and reporting in the model, prior to the declaration of an FMD outbreak. To avoid confusion, this function 443 en h e ob ed d epo d D Updated SSRA The estimated prevalence of symptomatic disease over time in an average herd, determined with the within herd model, a function of the state-specific herd size population distribution and production type specific disease characteristics (see Appendix A6, Within-Herd Model Data and Herd-Level Parameter Development); The frequency with which producers observe their animals, from SME interviews; The number of animals a producer observes at a time, from SME interviews; The likelihood that an observer would notice a cow was ill, based on foreign animal disease diagnostician (FADD) interviews (see Appendix A6, Kansas Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostician (FADD) Interviews on Time to Observable Symptoms); and The probability that a producer would call a veterinarian after observing symptoms, based on a survey of Kansas veterinarians about producer behavior (see Appendix A6, Backyard and Small- Scale (BY-SS) Producer Interviews and Data). The development of this function is described in detail in Appendix A6, Within-Herd Model Data and Herd-Level Parameter Development, and obs and rep functions (fxs) are given in Figures 6.1.4-20 to 6.1.4-22. Since this function describes normal producer behavior (not behavior during an outbreak), all production types have a significant delay in observing symptoms and contacting veterinarians (which would lead to reporting). This delay is most significant for goats and sheep because not all animals show discernible symptoms (even to a veterinarian) and profit margins are such that producers would be unlikely to contact a veterinarian unless a significant portion of his/her flock was symptomatic. 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 5 10 15 20 Perc t c ang serv an r rte FM Days since herd infected Cow Calf Feedlot (S) Feedlot (L) Dairy Beef (BY -SS) Figure 6.1.4-20 K \u0006 P T (N!!\u0007SM functions) 444 Percent change observed and reported FMD 100 80 60 40 20 0 Swine (S) Swine (L) Swine (BY- SS) 0 5 10 15 20 Days since herd infected Updated SSRA Figure 6.1.4-21 K S P T (N!!\u0007SM ati on functions) 100 Percent change observed and reported FMD 0 10 20 30 80 60 40 20 0 Days since herd infected Sheep Goats SmRu(BY- SS) Figure 6.1.4-22 K S R P T (N!!\u0007SM observation functions) the increase in both observation and reporting after an outbreak is declared. This function will be called ! producers look at their entire herd every day and contact a veterinarian at the first sign of disease after an outbreak has been declared. The multiplier was designed to shift the pre-outbreak obs and rep fx to approximately match this new curve that describes observation and reporting after an outbreak. The multiplier remains a % while the outbreak is publicized (Table 6.1.4-13). A multiplier of 100% will have no effect on the observation function, so observation and reporting is exactly as shown in the figures above. Once an outbreak is declared, the multiplier function increases, increasing the likelihood of observation and reporting that would result from publicity and producer education associated with an outbreak. The multiplier can be any value that is greater than 100% because it is intended to increase the likelihood of detecting an infected herd. As shown in Table 6.1.4-13, the multiplier values can be very high because it is anticipated that the public declaration of an FMD outbreak will significantly alter producer behavior. 445 446 Table 6.1.4 -13: Multiplier Functions for all Production Types (NAADSM Reporting Functions) Day Cow - Feedlot Feedlot Dairy Swine Swine Sheep Goats Beef Swine Small Ruminants Calf (S) (L) (S) (L) (BY-SS) (BY-SS) (BY-SS) 0 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 1 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 2 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 3 1300 5000 5000 5000 2000 2000 5000 4000 2000 3000 5000 4 1300 5000 5000 5000 2000 2000 5000 4000 2000 3000 5000 5 1300 5000 5000 5000 2000 2000 5000 4000 2000 3000 5000 6 1300 5000 5000 5000 2000 2000 5000 4000 2000 3000 5000 Updated SSRA Pre-Emptive Control Measures In a typical use of NAADSM, once disease has been officially detected, response efforts begin including increased surveillance, stop movements, destruction, and vaccination. In this study, several release events are caused by natural disasters that obviously affect containment (for example, a tornado hitting the NBAF). In the case of a natural disaster, mitigation efforts will likely be initiated immediately in anticipation of an outbreak. Until this study, there were no methods developed to use NAADSM to model the implementation of control measures prior to the detection of an infected herd. This presents a complication because when disease is detected in a production type, stop movement measures are applied to all herds in that production type. In a disaster event, the initial response will not be production type specific, so the infected herd detected in disaster events needed to be a unique without interacting with the larger livestock industry in any other way (described in Table 6.1.4-14). Table 6.1.4 -14: Pa V U P Initial state Clinical Geographic coordinates (37, -95) Latent Fixed (0) Subclinical Fixed (0) Clinical Fixed (1) Immune Fixed (0) Within -unit prevalence 0 Contact Spread OFF - Probability of observing clinica l signs 100% Probability of reporting once observed 100% Tracing OFF - Zones OFF - Destruction OFF - Vaccination OFF - Events that used the unicorn production type included self-announcing situations such as tornados and earthquakes where significant and obvious damage to the NBAF may have caused possible FMD release. Updated SSRA In these situations, it was assumed that the community would initiate preemptive response measures prior to an actual detection of disease in any of the monitored production types. Additionally, preemptive control measures were needed to model the potential benefit of systems that could detect the release of FMDv from the NBAF prior to the first infected animal (such as environmental monitoring systems) as described in the cost-benefit analysis. Tracing Once an infected unit has been detected in NAADSM, a tracing investigation can be triggered that will identify recipients of direct or indirect contact from the infected, detected herd (trace forward). Additionally, units that were sources of contact for the infected herd can be identified through tracing (trace-back). Tracing investigations are a standard part of FMD response plans, so they were incorporated in the Updated SSRA epidemiological modeling. Tracing parameters were sourced from USDA 2011, and so the evidence basis provided by USDA is provided with the parameters. Trace parameters USDA 2011 provides the following evidence basis for their parameters: \"Federal and state FMD response plans dictate that trace -forward and trace-back investigations should be conducted for premises where FMD infection is detected. A survey of 19 federal animal health managers, evaluating traceability of slaughter cattle and swine to the last farm of ownership under different animal identification scenarios, reported probabilities of trace success and delay in obtaining trace results [Disney et al., 2001]. The probabilities of success and delays in obtaining results varied by species and by animal identification method. Results reported from that survey and estimates of percentages of operations that use individual animal identification (or group/lot ID for swine) were used to calculate weighted averages of the probability of direct contact trace success and the delay in obtaining trace results. Percentages of operations that use individual animal identification were obtained from NAHMS reports, a National Scrapie Eradication Program report, the National Pork Board, and the American Sheep Industry Association. The results reported in the [Disney et al., 2001] study for the delay in obtaining trace results were reported as averages. To reflect variability in the delay in obtaining trace results, these parameters follow BetaPERT distributions with minimums of 0 days, maximums of 28 days and modes equal to the weighted average delay for each production type. A minimum of 0 days was used to allow the possibility that some direct contacts could be identified the same day that an infected herd is detected and reported. A survey of 11 traceability experts in California found that the maximum delay in obtaining trace results from dairies during a bovine TB investigation was 28 days (unpublished data). Therefore, this value was chosen as the maximum delay. Information on the probability of trace success of indirect contacts was not available in the published literature but was assumed to be lower than the probability of success of direct traces. Based on NAHMS data of record keeping practices, small ruminants were given a lower probability of indirect trace success than all cattle and swine production types. Parameters for the delay in obtaining indirect trace results were assumed to be the same as the delay in obtaining direct trace results. The number of days prior to detection that trace investigations were to be conducted reflects two times the incubation period, as stated in federal and state FMD response plans.\" 447 Table 6.1.4 -15: Tracing Parameters (Both for Direct and Indirect Tracing) Production Type Probability of direct Probability of indirect Delay in obtaining direct Period of contact trace in/out contact trace in/out and indirect trace results interest investigations investigations in days (min, mode, max) (in days) succeeding succeeding Cow -Calf 0.86 0.7 BetaPERT (0, 5.97, 28) 28 Dairy 0.93 BetaPE RT (0, 3.63, 28) 28 Feedlot(S) and 0.7 (0, 7.38, 28) 28 Feedlot(L) Sheep 0.87 0.5 BetaPERT (0, 5.57, 28) 28 Goats 0.87 0.5 BetaPERT (0, 5.57, 28) 28 Swine(L) 0.91 0.7 BetaPERT (0, 3.72, 28) 28 Swine(S) (0, 3.63, 28) 28 Updated SSRA When an infected unit is examined because of a trace, the observation function (see Detection section ab ove) is multiplied by the unit examination multiplier and the reporting function is assumed to be 100%. The Updated SSRA team used an alternate approach for these two functions, which more accurately models producer behavior during an outbreak. The alternate approach uses the reporting function as a multiplier, and so the 100% reporting used in the NAADSM tracing calculations would yield an incorrect detection rate. As a result, the team applied the maximum multiplier from the reporting function as the unit examination multiplier (Table 6.1.4-16); this results in a rate of identification of disease above 76%, in keeping with the approach described in USDA 2011, and corrects for the automatic use of 100% reporting in the NAADSM tracing calculations.

USDA 2011 parameters were used: \"FMD infection can be confirmed by ELIS!, virus isolation, o r RT-PCR [OIE, 2009]. The NVS Countermeasures Working Group [2007] recommended that commercial AG-ELISA tests be stockpiled for detection of FMD during an outbreak with no vaccination and the 3ABC commercial test kits (Cedi-diagnostics) be stockpiled to detect cases during an outbreak with vaccination. Because all scenarios, with the exception of the baseline scenario, will simulate outbreaks with vaccination, the parameters for diagnostic testing are based on the 3ABC commercial test kit. A comparative study of 6 ELISA tests [Brocchi et al., 2006] using cattle, swine, and sheep sera found the Cedi-diagnostic test to have a specificity of 98.1%. Sensitivity varied by vaccination status, experimental exposure status, and number of days post infection but generally approached 90%. Results were similar across species. Therefore sensitivity and specificity parameters are assumed to be the same for all species. ELISA assay results can be obtained within hours of sample delivery. However there may be a delay depending on herd distance from the nearest testing facility, time of day, or day of the week that samples are collected. Therefore, it is assumed that the delay in obtaining results follows a BetaPERT distribution with a minimum of 0 days, a mode of 1 day and a maximum of 2 days.\" Table 6.1.4 -17: Diagnostic Testing: Sensitivity, Specificity, and Delay in Obtaining Test Results for All Production Types in All States Diagnostic Parameter Value Sensitivity 0.9 Specificity 0.98 Delay in Obtaining Results BetaPER T (0, 1, 2) Zones Zoned movement control was not used for the Updated SSRA (universal movement control was used as described above). NAADSM does not model zone-based movement control in a manner consistent with the way zones will be controlled in an outbreak according to SME interviews. When a zone is triggered in NAADSM: Direct or indirect contracts are not permitted from facilities inside a zone (control or surveillance) to facilities outside the zone that are at a lower level of surveillance or control. So, for example, it is possible to ship animals into a control zone from a surveillance zone or from a zone with no control/surveillance in place. Another example is that no infected animals or fomite could leave a surveillance zone to contact a farm in an area that was not in a zone. Movement within a zone may be allowed, if units are not quarantined. Direct and indirect contact between units is not allowed if the source unit and receiving unit are in physically separated foci of the same zone or if the source unit is in a zone of a higher surveillance level than the receiving unit. 449 Updated SSRA Based on conversations with USDA and state and local officials in multiple states, human traffic will be allowed into and out of control zones with biosecurity measures in place that can significantly reduce disease transfer by indirect contact. Animals would be allowed to move under permit after inspection for disease as soon as several days after the control zone is established. Without the development of new diagnostic technology, some latent animals could potentially be released as a result (a very small but potentially significant source of direct contact out of zones that cannot be captured in NAADSM). In an actual outbreak, movement restriction would be less severe in a surveillance zone, but these zones are subject to the same NAADSM rules, so no direct or indirect contacts would be permitted to areas with less control. The use of zones unrealistically limits indirect and direct contacts from zones, as it does not allow for the small but significant failure of control measures, so zones were not used for the Updated SSRA. These conclusions are mirrored by a criticism of the approach used in the 2010 SSRA in which the reviewers stated that it was overly optimistic to assume that absolutely no movement would occur from inside an infected zone to an uninfected area. Even if zones allowed user specified levels of control in NAADSM, more research needs to be done to understand if sufficient resources would be available during an outbreak to control movement around all infected premises. Individual states only have the resources to control a few zones before they run out of manpower and equipment, they therefore rely heavily on federal resources to make up this shortfall. In most cases modeled, more premises are infected by the time the outbreak is announced and more control measures are implemented than can be controlled by state-organized teams; however, federal resources will be immediately available. During a multi-state outbreak, the resources that would be required from the federal government would be substantial in all parts of the outbreak, but especially in movement control. It might not be possible to control the movement of animals and people around all infected premises. It is likely that, even if a modified version of NAADSM were developed that allowed some reduced level of contact out of a zone, the number of zones (and the stringent movement control they enable) should be capped to reflect that unlimited resources are not available. Zones should be used together with less stringent universal movement control based largely on self-enforcement in the community (described in the universal movement control section). Herd Destruction First Day of Destruction Herd destruction begins a user-specified number of days after the outbreak is detected. Destruction starts two days after the outbreak is detected in the Updated SSRA model to allow time to organize the response based on USDA 2009 parameters. Destruction Capacity Destruction capacity is a function expressing the number of herds that can be destroyed each day, with capacity varying over time. The 2010 NAS SSRA Committee suggested that the destruction rate used was poorly explained and overly optimistic. For the Updated SSRA, an extensive data collection effort was performed and led to a new approach to calculating destruction capacity. Culling rate calculations 450 Tab le 6.1.4-18: Time Es timat es for Each Stage of Herd Depopul ation Herd Type Deploy (h) Setup (h) Round up (h) Baselin e Kill Rate (head /hour) Tear Down (h) Lot 0 6 0 20(cattle) 150(swine/small 0 6 Updated SSRA in clude the time needed to deploy and set up for depopulation, time to depopulate, and time to tear down the equipment. Modeling of destruction capacity is limited because no one has developed a modification to NAADSM that enables the consideration of factors that would affect how quickly premises can be destroyed. Currently, destruction capacity must be entered into NAADSM as a single function that applies to all herds, regardless of herd size or production type differences that significantly impact the daily destruction capacity. In the version of NAADSM currently available, the time needed to cull a backyard facility with five animals is the same as the time needed to cull a swine farm with 5,000 animals. Given these limitations, the Updated SSRA team chose a conservative destruction rate for the Updated SSRA. To calculate the destruction rate, the time needed for one team to destroy each herd in the Kansas model was calculated and included: deployment of equipment and personnel, set-up of depopulation apparatus, round-up of animals, depopulation of animals, and tear-down of depopulation apparatus. Disposal of animals was not included separately in the calculation because the culling rate accounts for the time to remove the carcass from the site of destruction. SME interviews indicate that disposal is likely to occur simultaneously with destruction, and some SMEs believe that, if necessary, disposal can continue with a less skilled team while the culling team moves on to a new facility. Setup of depopulation apparatus and round up of animals were estimated by SMEs (Table 6.1.4-18). Production types divide into two g -down time - greater setup/tear-down time, because they do not have the same infrastructure. Feedlots, dairies, - \u0012 -calf, sheep, and goat facilities - - ! backyard facilities were classified as non-lot (small). The number of hours to depopulate each facility was calculated by multiplying the appropriate baseline kill rate by the number of head of animals in that herd and then adding time for setup and tear-down based on the herd production type. So, a dairy with 100 animals would take five hours to cull the total 451 Tab le 6.1.4-19: Tot al Time to Herd Depopul ation for the Lar gest Fac ilities of Each Product ion T ype Facility Hours to destroy 85th perce ntile premises Hours to destroy Hours to destroy 99th perce ntile premises Feedlot 36 116 750 Dairy 17 18 316 Swine 9 61 130 Cow-Calf 36 40 66 Updated SSRA herd plus another six hours for setup. Given 12-hours shifts in a sustained emergency response, all but the largest 15% of premises of all types require three days (36 h) or less to cull for a single team (Table 6.1.4-19). Unfortunately, when the largest 5% or 1% of premises is included, the time to cull all premises increases significantly. Data could not be found to support whether a user has modified NAADSM to accommodate this variability, so a destruction rate was selected that aims to capture the vast majority of premises sizes (85%). Basing a rate on the largest 1% of premises, would ignore the fact that the vast majority of premises can be destroyed more quickly. The Updated SSRA team used the time required to cull herds in the 85 th percentile for herd size to calculate destruction capacity; this translates to a third of a premises culled per day per team. Not only does this approach capture the vast majority of premises, it also minimizes premises type differences (Figure 6.1.4-23). This rate is conservative because most premises will require less time to depopulate. On the other hand, the largest 1% of premises may require weeks to depopulate and may drive the overall culling rate if the outbreaks reach very large swine and feedlot facilities that are geographically clustered. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 0 20 40 60 80 100 Hours to destroy Size percentile Cow Calf Dairy Feedlot Swine Figure 6.1.4-23: Total Time to Herd Depopulation for the Facilities of the Most Prevalent Production Types The orange bar indicates the premises size used to set the culling rate in the Updated SSRA. 452 Table 6.1.4 -20: Range of Depopulation Teams Available from States in the Modeled Region Days into 1 10 20 30 40 50 60 outbreak 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Maximum Mean 2 7 12 12 12 13 13 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 Minimum Updated SSRA Info rmation was colle veterinarians, emergency coordinators, and health commissioners on resources available at the state level. The directors of the National Veterinary Stockpile and National Animal Health Emergency Response Corps (NAHERC) were consulted on the availability of federal resources. The state representatives were asked to identify the number of depopulation teams that would be available over the course of 60 days. Table 6.1.4-20 shows the range of responses of state representatives from four states in the modeled region. These states estimate that it will take at least ten days to deploy the maximum number of depopulation teams. Individual state destruction capacities are not provide d because this information is considered sensitive because it reveals strong and weak points in the Based on the number of teams available and a destruction rate of 1/3 per team per day, a destruction capacity for each state was estimated. When a state provided a destruction estimate, that estimate was used to calculate a state-specific destruction rate. For those states that did not respond to the survey, the mean number of destruction teams was used for modeling. The number of culling teams was provided in 10-day intervals and was interpolated linearly to determine the number of teams available on every day in the 60-day period. During an outbreak involving all seven states, 90 teams would be deployed. This function was interpreted as a representation of distinct deployment groups, each of which begins culling on their respective deployment date. Because three days are required for a team to destroy a herd, each team only contributes one herd to the total destruction capacity every third day. This creates an oscillatory pattern which is a function of the deployment timing of teams (Figure 6.1.4-24). It was assumed that withdrawals are made in the order of which teams were deployed (i.e. the first team deployed is the first team to be relieved). Withdrawals were only modeled in a single state, as reported -21 shows an example calculation for a notional event. The mean destruction capacity, which was used for those states where data was not collected on destruction capacity, can be found in Figure 6.1.4-24. 453 Table 6.1.4 -21: Notional Destruction Capacity Calculation Total Destruction Teams Deployed or Day Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 Group 4 Withdrawal 1 Capacity Available Withdrawn (Herds/day) 1 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 3 2 0 2 2 4 5 3 0 0 0 5 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 7 1 2 3 0 0 5 7 6 -1 0 0 1 0 0 1 8 5 -1 0 0 0 1 0 1 9 3 -2 2 3 0 0 -1 4 10 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 Updated SSRA 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Herds destroyed Day since destruction began Figure 6.1.4-24: Mean Destruction Capacity Function (herds/day) In Table 6.1.4-21, a notional destruction capacity calculation shows multiple deployments and withdrawals (please note withdrawals were only modeled in a single state, because that state indicated that teams are likely to withdraw as veterinarians need to return to their practices). Note that only the withdrawal made on day 7 has an impact within the time frame shown here and that it detracts from the culling cycle of deployment group 1; group 1 and group 3 have the same culling cycle by pure coincidence. The impact of withdrawals made on days 8 and 9 is not realized until day 12 which is not shown here. In order to be consistent, if a wi culling cycle then the impact is realized within that culling cycle. The withdrawals on day 7 and 8 do not impact groups 3 and 4 because the entireties of groups 1 and 2 have yet to be withdrawn. 454 Updated SSRA Destruction Priorities Destruction priorities were based on USDA 2011 parameters, but adapted for Updated SSRA production types (Table 6.1.4-22). The following evidence basis was provided in USDA 2011: \"If a unit is marked for destruction but cannot be destroyed immediately, it is quarantined and goes onto the following prioritized waiting list: Reason for destruction (Detection of disease > identification of a direct contact with a detected unit by trace investigation > identification of an indirect contact with a detected unit by trace investigation > Production type (Following the order in the table above) > Days holding Justification for assumptions The destruction priorities ensure that all detected units will be destroyed before traced units. Detected high priority production types will be destroyed before detected low priority production types regardless of time that units have been waiting for destruction. This setting follows from the assumption that the highest priority production types are at risk of causing airborne spread after quarantine has been imposed and should be destroyed before lower risk production types that have been waiting longer but are at lower risk of causing airborne spread .\" [USDA, 2011] Table 6.1.4 -22: Production Type Destruction Priority in NAADSM Priority Production type 1 Swine (L) 2 Swine(S) 3 Swine (BY -SS) 4 Feedlot(L) 5 Feedlot(S) 6 Dairy 7 Cow -Calf 8 Beef (BY -SS) 9 Sheep 10 Goat 11 Small Ruminants (BY -SS) Other Destruction Parameters In addition to destruction capacity and destruction priority several other parameters define destruction in NAADSM. These parameters are described in the follow excerpt from USDA 2011: \"!ll detected units are marked for destruction. Units that have had contact with diseased units within a given number of days prior to detection of the diseased unit (found through trace investigations) and units within a given distance of diseased units may also be marked for destruction. The destruction of these units associated by trace or distance is called preemptive destruction. 455 Updated SSRA According to the USDA foot- and-mouth disease response plan (the red book, 2010), four control strategies will be considered in the event of the outbreak. Three of these four strategies involve slaughter of all clinically affected units and units that have had direct or indirect contact with detected premises. The fourth strategy is a vaccination to live policy without stamping out where no slaughter takes place. Following the three strategies that involve slaughter, all detected and traced units will be destroyed and ring destruction will not be implemented.\" [USDA 2011] Vaccination Vaccination was not considered as part of the 2010 SSRA. For the Updated SSRA, the team incorporated a plausible vaccination response into epidemiological modeling because vaccination will almost certainly be employed as a mitigation strategy in the face of a large FMD outbreak. FMD vaccination policy is still an active area of study in this country and the Updated SSRA is not designed or intended to investigate FMD vaccination strategy, which deserves careful analysis focused just on aspects of the strategy. The approach aims to avoid use of these results to inform vaccination policy discussion while capturing the important effect vaccination would have on an FMD outbreak from the NBAF. Furthermore, the modeling of vaccination is designed to reflect the fact that the laboratory will operate (and therefore the response to accidents at the laboratory) only after 2020. Additionally, the exact speed and throughput of the vaccination-based response is considered sensitive information and such details will change considerably over the next nine years. To this end, the team interviewed SMEs at USDA to understand how a vaccination campaign may unfold in an outbreak around 2020 (see Appendix A6, USDA Vaccination Interviews for full interviews) and used this input, together with vaccination parameters from USDA 2011 (which is itself a vaccination study) to create a plausible set of vaccination parameters for the Updated SSRA. Essentially, the scenario proposed by USDA SMEs involves a delay before vaccination can commence to confirm serotype and acquire formulated vaccine; once vaccine is available it is available in unlimited quantities. The vaccination campaign is triggered as soon as the first herd is detected. NAADSM is commonly used to model administration of vaccine in a ring around detected, infected units. While a ring vaccination strategy would plausibly be employed during an outbreak, it is one of many possible vaccination strategies. Most NAADSM users model vaccine administration by a series of vaccination teams, similar to destruction capacity. However, almost all producers regularly vaccinate their own herds against other diseases and this expertise will certainly by leveraged by USDA during a large-scale outbreak. Given the approach to vaccination commonly implemented in NAADSM, the Updated SSRA team tried to capture the substantial vaccination capacity provided by producers in the vaccination capacity. However, the team was not able to truly implement the approach suggested by USDA because modifications to NAADSM that could model vaccination performed by producers have not been developed. Triggering Vaccination USDA indicated that for this scenario, the Updated SSRA team should assume that vaccination would likely be triggered by a single infected commercial herd near the NBAF. 456 Table 6.1.4 -23: Prod uction Type Specific Vaccination Rates Type Rate per 12 hr day Head per day Feedlot Minimum 780 Median 1440 Maximum 1800 Cow -Calf Minimum 300 Median 750 Maximum 1200 Swine Minimum 960 Median Maximum 1830 2700 Updated SSRA V accination Capacity For large outbreaks, vaccine (when available) will be distributed to each facility to be vaccinated. Vaccination will be undertaken by the workers at each facility simultaneously, enabling the most rapid response. Producers often administer their own vaccines, so this approach requires no special producer training. This approach is very different from the response commonly modeled in NAADSM in which a set of vaccination teams performs all vaccinations serially (similar to destruction, a set number of vaccination teams travels farm to farm). For this reason, a method was developed to approximate this type of response in NAADSM. In order to simulate simultaneous vaccination in many locations a method was designed to model the complete vaccination of the initial outbreak area in the appropriate amount of time. The initial vaccination capacity was approximated by dividing the number of premises that need vaccination when vaccine becomes available by the number of days needed to vaccinate all premises given the range of herd sizes that exist in the area. Because vaccination rate (herds/day) changes as a function of time, and not as a function of outbreak size, if the outbreak becomes uncontrolled, the time required to vaccinate all premises will increase and this will effectively simulate logistical issues with the delivery of vaccine to multiple infection foci. Because herd size is an important driver of the time needed to vaccinate a herd, the Updated SSRA team determined what fraction of premises could be vaccinated in a given time as a function of their size. Interviews with SMEs determined the range of possible vaccination rates at the premises of interest based on the resources available in each premises to handle animals (Table 6.1.4-23). Exploring a range of vaccination rates and premises sizes in Kansas led to a range of times required to v accinate all premises (Table 6.1.4-24). The slowest reasonable rates require ten days to vaccinate all premises (which is the average of the three bad cases below), while the fastest reasonable rates require three days to vaccinate nearly all premises. This analysis assumes that not all premises can reach the highest rates of vaccination, but the largest premises have more resources to vaccinate more quickly than the smaller premises. 457 Table 6.1.4 -24: Time to Vaccinate All Herds Given a Few Vaccination Rates and the Percent of Premises Sizes Left Out of the Analysis Case Type Vaccination Rate Basis Percentile Left Out Days to vaccinate Bad Case Feedlot median rate Largest 1% 11 Bad Case Swine median rate Largest 1% 11 Bad Case Cow -calf median rate Largest 1% 9 Good Case Feedlot low rate Swine low rate Largest 5% Largest 5% 3 3 Good Case Updated SSRA These data suggest that even if vaccines were immediately given to each producer, between three and elev en days would be required to vaccinate all herds. To translate this value into a daily vaccination rate usable by NAADSM, several test runs were conducted in which the number of herds that were queued for vaccination was counted when vaccine would be available. A three-day and seven-day delay in the availability of vaccine was considered and several runs across several starting location types were examined. The number of herds queued for vaccination was averaged across the runs that vary by starting location type (the values were calculated separately for the two delays). This number of premises queued were then divided by the range of time needed to vaccinate all herds based on size (3\u00ad11 days) to determine a range of plausible vaccination rates. From this analysis, a range of vaccination strategies was used for outbreaks in Kansas (the rate was re-computed for outbreaks in other states): 7-day delay to vaccination, 90 herds per day (Strategy A) 7-day delay to vaccination, 1,800 herds per day (Strategy B) 3-day delay to vaccination, 200 herds per day (Strategy C) Recall that the concept of operations in this FMD response scenario is for USDA to simply centrally distribute and dispense vaccine to producers so that they can vaccinate their own herds. Therefore, even the seemingly high rates of vaccination are not driven by federal resources but by the resources available at each farm. That being said, no current version of NAADSM can account for dynamic vaccination rates based on the number of premises in need of vaccination. For this reason, any of these rates may be inappropriately small for outbreaks that evolve quickly and inappropriately large for small outbreaks. Also, NAADSM is commonly used to model vaccination as a serial process undertaken by a set number of teams. For these reasons, the vaccination rates above are not at all intended to reflect the reality of what will happen after an outbreak, but a mathematical construct to better simulate the effect of this disease control measure. For all cost-benefit analyses, all three plausible vaccination strategies were used. For baseline epidemiological analysis, the use of all three vaccination strategies would triple the amount of modeling needed to perform the analysis. To determine which vaccination strategy would be used for the baseline, runs with several different starting locations were compared. Vaccination Strategy A leads to median outbreaks that are from two- to seven-fold more extensive (in terms of head culled or head 458 Updated SSRA vaccinated) than the other two strategies on average. At the extreme outputs, Strategy A leads to p90 outbreaks that are less than twice as extensive as the other two strategies on average and p5 outbreaks that are two- to eight-fold more extensive than the other two strategies on average. Across all outputs (p50, p10 and p90) outbreak duration was similar. For this reason, Strategy A is the conservative worst case of the plausible scenarios, but uniformly produces estimates of impact within the same order of magnitude as the other strategies. Moreover, the fold-difference between the extreme (p10 and p90) epidemiological outputs compared to the median (a measure of variance) is similar across the strategies (within about 10%). For these reasons, Strategy A was chosen to represent vaccination in NAADSM in Kansas for most studies. So, the vaccination parameters for the baseline included: Vaccination is triggered once one infected herd is detected; and Vaccination capacity for the first six days is 0, on day 7 (and all days after) 90 herds per day can be vaccinated each day. Given the uncertainty in the actual implementation of a vaccination strategy in an emergency, all cost- benefit analysis considers all three plausible strategies. Vaccine Immune Period Vaccine immune period was based on USDA 2011 parameters: \"Experimental studies on the duration of immunity using single dose high potency emergency vaccines have generally shown that titers remain high 6 months after vaccination [Cox & Barnett, 2009]; [USDA, 2011]. One study showed titers in cattle peaked at 2 months and remained high, declining slightly up to 6 months [Cox et al., 2010]. Another study showed waning titers in vaccinated cattle 43 days after vaccination [Barnett et al., 1996]. There are few challenge studies available beyond 28 days post-vaccination. One challenge study in cattle showed protection from clinical disease and high titers at 6 months [Cox et al., 2010]. Another challenge study in pigs showed protection at 7 months [Cox et al., 2003]. To reflect the uncertainty due to the lack of experimental data available, and the fact that immunity generally lasts at least 6 months, the duration of immunity for all species is assumed to follow a BetaPERT distribution with a minimum of 28 days, a maximum of 220 days, and a mode of 180 days.\" [USDA 2011] Delay in Immunity Following Vaccination The delay in immunity following vaccination was based on USDA 2011 parameters. However, an additional delay was added to large feedlots to help account for the additional time it would take to vaccinate an entire large feedlot, based on the feedlot vaccination rates discussed in the vaccination capacity section. For premises types that exclusively concern themselves with large herds (like the larg e feedlot and large swine operations), the time to vaccinate the median herd was determined. If this delay 459 Updated SSRA was longer than the delay used to calculate the vaccination rate, additional time was added to the delay in protective immunity. \"Vaccine parameters were developed under the assumption that high potency emergency vaccines (PD 506) would be used. N!!DSM assumes that vaccination is 100% effective. Therefore the delay in immunity parameter should be selected to reflect the time required for a herd to become completely protected from clinical disease/virus shedding. Experimental studies have shown that vaccinated cattle and sheep are partially protected as early as 4 days post vaccination but may take up to 14 days for complete protection[Cox & Barnett, 2009]; [Barnett & al., 2010]; [USDA 2011]. Results varied by study design, species, challenge strain, and vaccine. Onset of immunity in pigs generally takes longer to achieve than for other species, generally requiring at least 21-28 days for complete protection [Doel et al., 1994; Parida et al., 2007]. In consultation with subject matter experts, a value of 24 days was chosen for swine and 10 days for non-swine species .*\" [USDA 2011] *For the Updated SSRA, large feedlots had an additional delay of 6 days . Time Between Vaccinations Time between vaccinations was based on USDA 2011 parameters: \"Revaccination in N!!DSM can occur in situations where a new vaccination ring is created around herds that had also been located within an older vaccination ring and were previously vaccinated. The OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals [2010] recommends that revaccination occur at 4-12 months and we have assumed that the duration of immunity for most herds will last approximately 6 months. We have assumed that, under conditions of limited vaccination resources, decision makers would not elect to revaccinate a herd unless at least 6 months had elapsed since the prior vaccination.\" [USDA 2011] Triggering Vaccination Ring Vaccination ring zone size was also based on USDA 2011 parameters: \"The size of a vaccination ring zone should be the smallest area necessary to control the outbreak, taking into consideration geographical barriers, climatic conditions, the number and distribution of detected FMD infected herds, the density of farms, and species present. Therefore the optimal ring size will vary by location. However, a modeling study of vaccination strategies using data from the 2001 U.K. outbreak found that the optimal ring size had a radius from 8\u00ad 10km and was robust to variation in epidemiological parameters such as susceptibility of 49 species and transmissibility of virus [Tildesley et al., 2006]. Therefore a vaccine ring with a radius of 10km was chosen for all production types . \" [USDA 2011] Vaccination Priority The evidence basis for production type prioritization is from USDA 2009; the following evidence basis was provided: 460 Updated SSRA \"Feedlots are prioritized for vaccination given the large number of cattle on a premises making it difficult to depopulate all of the cattle in a timely fashion and because they are terminal animals that fit a vaccinate to slaughter strategy thus conserving destruction capacity and production value. Swine are next because of the potential for high levels of shedding and risk of transmission. Cow-calf and Dairy operations are lower priority because they are smaller sized operations that are more easily destroyed and are long lived animals that will require destruction. Sheep and goats are last given th at they are a minor species.\" [USD! 2009\\ Backyard production types were prioritized lowest on the list, based on SME input. The vaccination prioritization entered into NAADSM is outlined below: Priority for vaccination: 1. Ring 2. Days holding 3. Production type 4. Feedlot(L) 5. Feedlot(S) 6. Swine(L) 7. Swine(S) 8. Cow-calf 9. Dairy 10. Sheep 11. Goats 12. Beef(BY- SS) 13. Swine(BY- SS) 14. Small Ruminants(BY- SS) 6.1.5 Estimating Probability of Spread to States Other than Kansas The 2010 SSRA leveraged a sales barn production type, developed by the 2010 SSRA team, to capture the risk that interstate animal movement could spread FMD between states. The 2010 SSRA was rightly criticized for this approach because only a portion of interstate animal movement occurs through sales barns. The Updated SSRA team knows of no group that has included premises contact rates in NAADSM that uses a solid evidence basis to simulate interstate movement. Therefore, premises from a variety of states could not be included on the same model map. Instead of modeling sales barns specifically, interstate disease spread was estimated in the Updated SSRA by modeling the states in the region independently. The probability that an animal with a latent or subclinical infection gets shipped to another state is calculated for each outbreak modeled in Kansas. If an infected animal is determined to have moved to another state, that event triggers a model run for the other state and the consequences across all affected states are considered together. This method is elaborated upon briefly below. 461 Updated SSRA To determine the probability that an infected shipment of animals is moved from Kansas to another state, the Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (CVIs), which are required for most types of interstate animal movement, were acquired for the state of Kansas for shipments to the other states in the modeled region (see Appendix A6, 2010 CVIs for Modeled Region). This analysis included the records of more than 10,000 animal shipments (more than 500,000 animals) originating in Kansas and traveling to other states in the modeled region during 2010. From these data, the number and type of animals moving from Kansas to each other state per day were calculated. Given the total number of animals of each type in Kansas, the chance that any given animal would be shipped out of state on any given day was calculated. Running modeling scenarios in NAADSM with Kansas alone, the number of animals with latent and subclinical infections was recorded on a daily basis (clinically infected animals are unlikely to be granted a CVI). These animals are counted until the outbreak is announced. To simulate the possibility that CVIs may be granted for animals outside the known infected area in a state after an outbreak is detected, latent and subclinical animals data are collected from NAADSM modeling runs over the first month, even after the outbreak is announced, but this total is reduced by 99% to account for the additional scrutiny and reduced demand for animals from that state. By the end of the month, uncontrolled outbreaks are normally identified all over the infected state, so no animals are considered to be transported out of state after this time. Given the number of animals that could spread the disease and the number of animals moving on any day, the probability that the disease could spread to another state from an outbreak in Kansas can be calculated. This analysis also considered the total number of shipments and number of premises in Kansas to calculate the risk that an infected shipment occurred to determine if shipment-based risk was worse than animal-based risk. For all cases, calculations based on infected animals caused a greater risk than infected shipments and therefore this shipment-based method was not carried through the analysis to partially compensate for the fact that this modeling approach artificially reduces the chance of disease spread across borders by modeling the states independently and preventing shipments between states other than Kansas. The method above was used to predict the probability that an infected animal would be shipped from Kansas to another state. To determine where in that state the animal went, a more detailed set of CVI data was used. This CVI dataset included the animal type, purpose of the shipment (e.g., feeding or breeding) and the destination city. All CVI data were compiled from paper records into spreadsheet format. This resource intensive project limited the amount of data that could be collected. Therefore, the team collected and analyzed information from only the counties near the NBAF. Using these data, the types and locations of premises receiving an infected animal can be determined; specifically, the state, city and facility type (e.g., feedlots received cattle shipped for feeding, for example). Locations receiving animals destined for slaughter (rare in the CVI set) were removed from the model and not considered as possible starting locations. A facility that matched the facility type and location were selected for each destination location mentioned in the CVIs and the relative probability of an outbreak starting at each of these locations was calculated based on the number of animals received by that facility compared to the total received by that state. That is, if a feedlot in Sioux City, Iowa, receives 462 Updated SSRA 1,000 cattle each year from Kansas and Iowa receives 100,000 cattle overall, 1% of all outbreaks modeled in Iowa will be modeled to start in the Sioux City feedlot chosen. This method has several strengths and weaknesses that should be highlighted. First, the use of CVI data captures the movement of animals from any facility in Kansas to any other state in the model, not just those animals sold through sales barns. This method also accounts for the probable destination of interstate shipments, which should focus secondary outbreaks in the areas with the most livestock industry. The modeling of each state separately facilitates the incorporation of state-specific mitigation efforts (as described below, each state has a unique estimate for culling resources, for example). Most importantly, this method has a solid evidence basis for the long-distance movement that does occur. Regarding weaknesses of this approach, one major weakness is that this method overly isolates state borders; disease cannot spread due to indirect contact or wind-borne spread between states. Moreover, the model does not consider second-order spread among states that received an infected animal from Kansas (the spread of disease from Oklahoma to Texas, for example). Also, CVI data does not capture A method should be developed to include all states in a single modeling region to enable direct and indirect disease spread among states in NAADSM. This inclusion relies on the generation of evidence- based production types specific for each state with contact rates adjusted to consider trans-border contacts. The contact rates and distance functions must be adjusted to reflect the risk of animal movement via short and long-distance movement. 6.1.6 Estimating Extent of Outbreaks in Other States In order to model each state independently, a separate NAADSM baseline file was created for Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa, Missouri, Texas, and Oklahoma. Scenarios were run using each file to estimate the outcome of an FMD outbreak in the region. While most parameters remained the same for each state, parameters developed using the within herd model were determined for each state. State-specific contact rates were determined for Missouri and Iowa, because SME input indicated that the livestock practices in those states were the most different from Kansas. Destruction rate parameters were developed when state interview data were available. The Updated SSRA team took advantage of parameters developed for Texas in USDA 2011 whenever possible. 6.1.6.1 General NAADSM Setup The general NAADSM setup was the same for all states. 6.1.6.2 Production Types Updated SSRA Production Types The same production types were used for all states. 463 Updated SSRA Wildlife For the Updated SSRA, the team collected limited data on wildlife populations in the additional states modeled. While most states maintain harvest data on wildlife species in their state, estimates of total population or population density were not always available. All states modeled had significant deer populations. Elk and Pronghorn were only present in some states; these populations tend to be small compared to deer populations. Nebraska also has two bighorn sheep populations with between 100-200 animals total [Taylor, 2011]. Feral swine could play a significant role in an FMD outbreak in several states modeled. Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri all have significant, uncontrolled feral swine populations (Figure 6.1.6-1). Colorado, Iowa, and Nebraska have small feral swine populations. Feral swine would likely play a minor role in an FMD outbreak in these states. All three states have task forces to eradicate introduced swine [Garner, 2011; Pelzer, 2011]. Iowa has trapped and killed a total of 181 feral swine since 2006 [Garner, 2011]. Figure 6.1.6-1: Map of Swine Populations in the Modeled Region [The University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, 2007] Susceptible Animal Populations -Farm/Facility Sizes and Locations For the Updated SSRA, the team used CAFO data, D&B data, and a dataset develop by LLNL using NASS Agricultural Census data to build a population file for each state (Table 6.1.6-1).

Disease Progression Herd Level Disease Periods Herd-level disease phases were estimated as described for Kansas. State-specific parameter development and results are listed in Appendix A6, Within-Herd Model Data and Herd-Level Parameter Development. Within-Unit Prevalence The proportion of animals infected in a herd is expressed by the within-unit prevalence function. Within- unit prevalence functions were calculated for each production type for each state using output from the within-herd model. Calculation details and complete functions are found in Appendix A6, Within-Herd Model Data and Herd-Level Parameter Development. Disease Spread Direct Contact Rates and Distance Distributions USDA SMEs expressed concern that production practices in Missouri and Iowa are significantly different from Kansas and recommended that the Updated SSRA team develop a new contact rate for these states. Due to time constraints the team was unable to create a full set of direct contact parameters; however, several SMEs from each state were interviewed to determine how the contact parameters for their state would vary from the contact rates developed for Kansas (Appendix A6, Direct Contact Rate 466 Updated SSRA and Distance Distribution Parameters). Contact rates were multiplied by 365, so that they were expressed in shipments per year for SME interviews. The evidence basis for these contact rates is weak; however, SME advice indicated that this approach was more accurate than applying Kansas parameters to these states. Direct contact rates and distances for Texas were developed for the USDA 2011 study. The evidence basis for these parameters can be found in Appendix A6, Texas Direct Contact Parameters Evidence Basis. The same parameters were used to describe backyard-small-scale (Beef BY-SS, Swine BY\u00ad SS, Small Ruminant BY-SS) contact for all states, so these parameters are not listed again in this section. State specific direct contact rate parameters and direct contact distance distributions are provided for each state in Appendix A6, Direct Contact Rate and Distance Distribution Parameters. Indirect Contact Rate Indirect contact rate and distance distributions were the same for all states except Texas. The same parameters were used to describe backyard-small-scale (Beef BY-SS, Swine BY-SS, Small Ruminant BY-SS) contact for all states, so these parameters are not listed again in this section. State specific parameters are listed in Appendix A6, Indirect Contact Rate and Distance Distribution Parameters, along with the evidence basis for the Texas parameters. Probability of infection given exposure was the same for all production types. Effect of Movement Control on Both Direct and Indirect Contact The same movement control parameters were used for all states. Airborne and Local Spread The same airborne and local area spread parameters were used for all states. Detection ! observation and reporting in the model prior to the declaration from this point forward. The obs and rep fx was developed for each state because it takes into account state-specific data on the estimated prevalence of symptomatic disease over time in an average herd, determined with the within herd model a function of the herd size population distribution and production type specific disease characteristics. All other data used to develop these parameters were each state. Functions are provided in Appendix A6, Within-Herd Model Data and Herd-Level Parameter Development. Tracing The tracing parameters developed for Kansas were used for all states modeled. Zones Zone parameters were not used for any state modeled, as explained above. 467 Updated SSRA Destruction Destruction capacity was the only destruction parameter developed for each state; all other parameters hrough a series of interviews with state veterinarians, emergency coordinators, and health commissioners on resources available at the state level. Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa each provided an estimate of the number of teams they would be able to recruit and these estimates were used to calculate state-specific destruction capacities. For those states that did not provide an estimate, the mean destruction rate was used. Destruction parameters were developed as described in Section 6.1.4. Individual state destruction capacities are not provided because this information is considered sensitive because it reveals strong Vaccination The vaccination parameters developed for Kansas were used for all states modeled. 6.1.7 Determine Overall Risk Should an Accident Occur As described above, the overall risk of an outbreak in the Updated SSRA considers the range of impact of each outbreak in Kansas and other states individually, and the probability that an infected animal would move between Kansas and one or more of the other states. For events which only a few possible starting locations in Kansas are identified, the risk of interstate disease spread is calculated for the event starting at each location. This approach pertains to the solid and liquid waste events, each of which can infect only a handful of possible premises. For events that can begin an infection at multiple starting locations (for example, the transference pathway) the outcomes from a modeling run for each Kansas starting location are ranked by impact (total head culled, for example). The risk of movement is calculated for the starting location that causes the median impact and the starting locations that cause the p5, p25, p75 and p95 impacts. The probability of an outbreak starting in any given location is then combined with the probability that the outbreak spreads to another state. For example, assume that Premises A is the starting location in 50% of simulations for Event 1. If outbreaks in Premises A have a 10% risk of spreading to Texas (and no risk of spreading to other states), then 45% of outbreaks for Event 1 start in Premises A but spread to no other state whereas 5% of outbreaks for Event 1 start in Premises A and spread to Texas. The probabilities of spread to all six other states in the model are considered together, as are all the possible combinations of the disease spreading to multiple states. For the events that spread from Kansas to multiple states, the consequences are considered together for those simulations. Head culled, premises culled, head vaccinated and premises vaccinated are summed across all states where the outbreak is considered to have spread. For disease duration, the longest duration of an outbreak in any of the states affected was reported. Continuing the example from above, following from Event 1, if an outbreak in Kansas starting from Premises A lasted for 100 days and involved the culling of 100,000 animals and an outbreak in Texas lasts for 120 days and involves the culling of 50,000 animals, then 45% of outbreaks due to Event 1 last for 100 days and involve the culling 468 Updated SSRA of 100,000 head and 5% last for 120 days and involve the culling of 150,000 animals. In the economic analysis, the animals and premises affected by the outbreak were reported on a state- by-state basis. 6.1.8 Considering Uncertainty The modeling in the Updated SSRA must contend with at least three types of uncertainty. The first type of uncertainty is pure epistemic uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty uncertainty that stems from incomplete knowledge of a subject arises due to unknowns regarding agricultural practices (for example, how many premises share the same veterinarian) and the epidemiology of FMD (e.g., the dose of FMDv that would infect 1% of cattle). True epistemic uncertainty complicates the interpretation of the results of this project in absolute terms. For this reason, the Updated SSRA presents an analysis of the sensitivity of key results to the most uncertain parameters. Those parameters include infectious dose thresholds, direct and indirect contact rates, effectiveness of control measures on reducing direct and indirect contacts, culling rates and vaccination rates. Uncertainty related to the initial focus of an infection due to a release event is largely driven by aleatory uncertainty (although some aspects are driven by epistemic uncertainty, like the probability that a herd would be infected by a low-concentration aerosol, but these aspects are explored separately). Unknowns related to the weather conditions that prevail during a release event, the distribution of animals in a pasture or the identity of a researcher that incompletely decontaminates (which ation to encounter a susceptible animal) all contribute to the variety of possible premises that could be initially infected. For some release events (like the waste scenarios) the aleatory uncertainty is small and the outbreak can plausibly start at only one or two premises. For other events, like many of the large aerosol releases, the aleatory uncertainty is large (and driven by the variety of meteorological conditions that could transport the material from the NBAF to susceptible animals) and there are many possible starting locations (many of which involve the simultaneous initial infection of multiple premises). Uncertainty due to starting location is explored and discussed fully in the Updated SSRA. For each release event, all possible starting locations are modeled and the consequences of outbreaks that start at each location are shown. The consequences of the outbreak for each starting location are ranked to ns, it is possible to identify and discuss the median starting location (in terms of its outbreak consequences) and the p5, p25, p75, and p95 starting locations. Even for release events with few possible starting locations, the possibility that outbreaks could spread to other states (which was determined to occur in most outbreaks) exacerbates the uncertainty of starting locations. The probability of disease spread to other states due to an outbreak in a given location is used to modify the baseline probability of the outbreak starting in that location in Kansas. Taking the same example from above, Premises A is the starting location in 50% of simulations for Event 1. If outbreaks in Premises A have a 10% risk of spreading to Texas (and no risk of spreading to other states), then 45% of outbreaks for Event 1 start in Premises A but spread to no other state whereas 5% 469 Updated SSRA of outbreaks for Event 1 start in Premises A and spread to Texas. The other 50% of simulations start in another location in Kansas, some of which spread to other states (some portion, and probably not 10%, of these outbreaks spread to other states). To determine which of the starting locations in each state should be linked to the outbreak starting in any given location in Kansas, the rank order of the premises are matched. That is, a median starting location in Kansas is linked to the median starting location in every other state (and the probability that this location actually initiates an outbreak in other states is calculated as above). In this way, the maximum uncertainty is presented because the starting locations that lead to the largest outbreaks in Kansas are linked to the starting locations that lead to the largest outbreaks in other states, and so on. Linking starting locations randomly or linking locations on the opposite ends of the variance (such as linking the p5 starting location in Kansas to the p95 starting location in Kansas) would reduce the total uncertainty presented by driving all outputs toward the median result. Once the total consequences of an outbreak across all states are known, and the probability of this interstate spread is considered, the starting locations are re- median starting conditions are assigned, which consider a particular starting location and the starting locations of all states to which the disease has spread). Another type of uncertainty explored by the Updated SSRA arises from the fact that NAADSM is a stochastic model that produces a different result in each model iteration. This uncertainty is largely aleatory because the model calculates if an infection spreads from an infected premises to others in the surrounding area by determining if a contact was made, and if so, where the contact was by using draws against a probability distribution. Also, the efficacy of control measures is driven, to some degree, by the uncertainty of an infected premises being discovered and its placement in a queue for destruction. For example, each day, the model determines if an infected animal (or contaminated worker) moves from one farm to another, thereby possibly spreading the disease, given the probability that movement would occur on any given day. These small differences add up across the myriad possible contacts and produce a different output (in terms of duration and consequences) for each iteration. Across all ! median result was discussed and used in the final results. In the Updated SSRA, the team presents not only the median results, but also less likely, but possible, outcomes. Considering these other cuts together allows the reader to understand what portion of the risk space a given result occupies given the uncertainty inherent in the NAADSM model. For example, 90% of all results from the model will lie between the p5 and p95 (the iterations for which 5% or 95% of the consequences were smaller) cuts. The 2010 SSRA explicitly explored the epistemic uncertainty related to modeling parameters (in a separate section) for the baseline result (an outbreak starting in a cow-calf farm), but did not explore sensitivity of important results (like the benefit of additional culling capacity) to these changes. Also, sensitivity of results to changes in the aerosol infection threshold was not explored in the 2010 SSRA. In and the median results for that starting location were the only ones shown. All graphs depicted the 470 Updated SSRA median results for a variety of starting locations that were possible for each pathway. Uncertainty arising from the variability in epidemiological modeling was discussed, but not presented as part of the final results. The Updated SSRA captures all these types of aleatory uncertainty by presenting baseline results with uncertain starting locations and epidemiological output and explores epistemic uncertainty in the sensitivity analysis. 6.1.9 Example: Putting It All Together To better illustrate how the epidemiological modeling approach considers uncertainty in starting location and NAADSM outbreaks, consider the following simple example. A modest spill outside of containment creates an aerosol that is transported by the wind and can infect one of two premises (Premises A 73% of the time and Premises B 27% of the time that at least one premises becomes infected). NAADSM is used to predict the extent and duration of an outbreak starting at each of these locations and the two possible starting locations can be ranked by their median impact (such as duration, herds culled, or, in this example, head culled). In Figure 6.1.9-1, below, the Y-axis represents the probability that an outbreak would start in any given location and the X-axis represents the impact (in head culled) of outbreaks at this location. Because outbreaks starting in Premises A are less consequential than outbreaks starting in Premises B, Premises A occupies the bottom 73% of the risk space and Premises B occupies the remaining 23% (because no other locations can be initially infected by this event). Figure 6.1.9-1: Cumulative Risk Distribution Function Showing Median Impact vs. Possible Starting Locations for the Example 471 Updated SSRA This graph resembles graphs used to describe risk in the 2010 SSRA and explicitly considers the uncertainty in the starting location. However, only the median epidemiological output is shown. In the Updated SSRA, uncertainty is shown not only for starting location but for the uncertainty in the output of NAADSM. The p5, p25, p75, and p95 outputs were added to the median results in Figure 6.1.9-2. This analysis is informative because it shows the vast difference in consequences between the two locations disappears at the highest consequence outputs of NAADSM (the p75 and p95). Also, this analysis suggests, for both locations, the majority of outbreaks result in a million or more head culled but no outbreaks result in more than eight million head culled. Figure 6.1.9-2: Cumulative Risk Distribution Function Showing Impact vs. Possible Starting Locations for the Example, Given Uncertainty in the NAADSM Outputs To illustrate how the risk of movement to other states is considered, it is easiest to focus solely on the median NAADSM output for now. For an outbreak at each location, the chance that the disease would spread to another state is computed, where the probability that the disease would spread is considered alongside the probability of the outbreak starting in that location in Kansas, originally. The consequences across all states are summed to compute the total consequences for the outbreak that spreads to multiple states. These possibilities can be ranked and plotted as above. In Figures 6.1.9- 3 and 6.1.9-4, 472 Updated SSRA the total impact of outbreaks across all states is summed and ranked and plotted as a function of probability that the disease spreads to other states (or stays in Kansas). Figure 6.1.9-3 highlights how outbreaks that stay in Kansas are a fraction of all the outbreaks that start in any location in Kansas (in this case, only 20% of the outbreak starts stay in Kansas). Also note that the total consequences of outbreaks that stay in Kansas are the same if the impact is summed across all states (because the impact in other states is zero). Figure 6.1.9-3: Impact of Outbreaks in Kansas (left) and Impact of Outbreaks Summed Across all States (right) as a Function of Probability the Spread Would Occur Arrows illustrate the outbreaks that are contained in Kansas. Figure 6.1.9-4 highlights how consequences of the outbreak that spread to other states add to the total risk of the outbreak. The arrows point out outbreaks considered to spread from the two initial starting locations to various other states. Each other data point on the curve is a different combination of states into which FMD was considered to spread. The total impact is summed across all states to obtain the X- axis value. For example, the one data point at 0.6 on the Y-axis and 7.4M on the X-axis represents outbreaks that start in Premises A and spread to Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, and also Texas. This specific outcome is calculated to occur 40% of the time that an outbreak begins for this event (or 55% of the time an outbreak occurs at Premises A). Note also that the outbreaks that spread from Premises A are less consequential in total than outbreaks that spread from Premises B. This phenomenon results from the fact that the high-consequence premises in Kansas are linked to high-consequence premises in other states (and low-consequence premises in Kansas are linked to low-consequence premises in other states) to unmask all the uncertainty inherent in the choice of starting locations in each state. 473 Updated SSRA Figure 6.1.9-4: Impact of Outbreaks in Kansas (left) and Impact of Outbreaks Summed Across all States (right) as a Function of Probability the Spread Would Occur Arrows illustrate the outbreaks that spread to other states from Kansas. The data shown in Figure 6.1.9-4 (and most data shown in the 2010 SSRA) is derived from the median !!D ! of NAADSM alone does not capture the possible paths an outbreak could plausibly take. For this reason, in the Updated SSRA, uncertainty related to starting location and the modeling in NAADSM is presented. In Figure 6.1.9-5, the summed impact of outbreaks across all states is given for the median, p5 and p95 NAADSM outbreaks. Together, these data present uncertainty in the starting location of the outbreak within Kansas, the uncertain probability of spread to other states (and which combination of states should it spread) and the uncertainty of the extent and duration of outbreaks that occur in Kansas and the other states. If only the median NAADSM outbreak were considered, uncertainty in starting location and spread to other states (the Y-axis) would suggest the outbreak could involve the culling between 400,000 and 17 million animals for 80% of possible outcomes. Once the p5 and p95 NAADSM outbreaks are considered, between 4,000 and 32 million animals could be culled to capture 80% of the possible outcomes (the points that cover this space are shown by an arrow in Figure 6.1.9-5). There are several ways to use the data provided. If the NAADSM parameters used are thought overly conservative (such that the outbreak would spread more aggressively than modeled), then one could consider only the p95 line for NAADSM outputs to reflect reality. Conversely, one could consider only 474 Updated SSRA the p5 line if it is thought the parameters would overestimate the spread of the disease. Alternatively, the p5 outbreaks could reflect the possibility that outbreaks were noticed early and contained well, whereas the p95 outbreaks could reflect many things going wrong in controlling the disease. Using this logic, more than 50% of the outbreaks involved the culling of less than 50,000 animals if the outbreak were well contained. Conversely, none of the poorly controlled outbreaks involved the culling of less than 30 million animals. Figure 6.1.9-5: Impact of Outbreaks Summed Across all States as a Function of Probability the Spread Would Occur NAADSM p5, p50, and p95 outputs are shown. The arrow links the p5 starting location-p5 NAADSM output with the p95 starting locations-p95 NAADSM output. Between the tips of the arrow is 80% of the uncertainty due to outbreak starting location, interstate spread and NAADSM-driven 475 Updated SSRA 6.2 Results To model the impact of an outbreak of FMD caused by a release from the NBAF, more than 750,000 NAADSM iterations were run in more than 4,000 model runs. The more complex release events (those that could infect many possible premises) were simulated by more than 100 model runs and more than 200,000 model iterations. Approximately 1.5 terabytes of data were generated by NAADSM across all model runs in this effort (equivalent to the quantity of text in about 1,500 encyclopedias). NAADSM was adapted to the study by the development of a database of more than 700,000 premises (80 million animals) based on real location and holding data for large premises and computed livestock locations for small premises in a region comprising Kansas and six nearby states. The development of contact parameters specific to practices in each state enabled the model to be used for this region. Outbreaks in other states were modeled independently of outbreaks in Kansas; however, they were linked by calculations based on the chance that infected animals would be shipped between the states. 6.2.1 Summary of Impact The modeling performed by the Updated SSRA team has reinforced the commonplace notions regarding an outbreak of FMD: if the disease is detected early and only a few premises are infected, the outbreak can be contained; if the disease is not detected early, it may spread to many premises within the state of Kansas and other states. The various NBAF release events examined could start infections at the many types of facilities that surround the NBAF. If the initial premises infected is a backyard operation or a premises that raises goats, the disease is less likely to spread explosively to many other facilities and to other states before it is contained, versus outbreaks that begin in feedlots, commercial cow-calf operations or larger swine operations in the Manhattan, Kansas, area. However, if the disease spreads to many premises before it is detected, the consequences are similar regardless of where the outbreak began. The qualitative description explains why the modeling results are dominated by the aleatory uncertainty inherent in the NAADSM model (for example, the timing of an animal shipment relative to the arrival of an infection to that premises). For any given outbreak starting location (or locations for aerosol events that simultaneously infect more than one premises initially), the epidemiological results vary significantly between the median NAADSM output and the p95 output (for which only 5% of the iterations produce more consequential outbreaks) and the p5 (for which only 5% of the iterations produce less consequential outbreaks). In general, the p95 outputs from NAADSM can be thought of as reflecting the most poorly controlled outbreaks (outbreaks are detected relatively late, or shipments of animals within the state or to other states occurred soon after the disease reaches a premises), whereas the p5 outputs from NAADSM generally reflect outbreaks in which all events favored containment (the disease was detected early and shipments of animals did not follow the arrival of the disease to a new premises, etc). In the most poorly controlled outbreaks involving the surreptitious release of FMDv, the model predicts the impact is significant, regardless of where the outbreak starts. Assuming that all animals that are ever 476 Updated SSRA infected are culled, between 20 and 30 million animals would be culled, 50 to 70 million animals vaccinated and the outbreak and associated control measures would last several years (mostly to depopulate farms that were infected sometime in the outbreak). The disease itself would be circulating amongst livestock for, at most, a year and a half (about 500 days) before control measures could contain it. Given that the virus is no longer circulating, mass culling may not be the strategy adopted to return U.S. agriculture to normal operations, as explained further below in Section 6.2.1.2. In contrast, the consequences of the median (p50) and best case (p5) outbreaks depend significantly on where the outbreak begins. This dependence on starting location reflects the degree to which the initially infected facility is integrated with the larger agricultural economy. If a relatively large commercial producer is the first location infected, the chances are significant that an outbreak spreads to other facilities and other states before the implementation of effective control measures, and therefore, the median (and sometimes even best case) NAADSM output suggests that more than a million animals would be culled and the disease would spread to several other states (given that mass culling is used to control the outbreak even after the virus is no longer circulating). If a small goat herd is the first premises infected, then even the median NAADSM output suggests that the disease is likely well contained and does not spread much beyond the initial few premises infected. Across all possible premises initially infected (with a few exceptions for the isolated small ruminant producers), the median results predict that between one and 16 million animals would be culled, and between seven and 40 million animals would be vaccinated, in a disease outbreak that lasts more than a year (assuming mass culling is the strategy used to deal with previously infected animals). If a relatively small or isolated premises is initially infected, the best case NAADSM outputs (p5) suggests that the outbreak could be contained in about a month and involve the culling and vaccination of less than 50,000 animals. See summary Tables 6.2.1-1, 6.2.1-2, and 6.2.1-3 for a review of the data. Some FMDv releases are initiated by a catastrophic natural disaster (tornado and earthquake events) damaging the NBAF. Even though these events foster the release of a significant amount of FMDv and lead to the initial infection of many farms simultaneously (the large tornado release typically infects more than 50 farms due to the amount of infectious material released from the NBAF), the fact that these events are obvious to the response community enables the implementation of control measures before the first animal starts to show signs of infection. For this reason, the chance that the disease spreads to other states is lower than in smaller surreptitious releases and the consequences and extent of the overall outbreak is smaller. In the best cases, the outbreak can be contained to the premises initially infected and very few animals are culled and vaccinated in an outbreak that lasts no more than a month. Across all outputs, the impact and duration of an FMD outbreak caused by a natural disaster can be extremely severe (with millions of animals culled and vaccinated), but not as severe as in surreptitious releases that initially infect fewer farms. For example, compare the median large tornado output (two million animals culled) and the median liquid waste event (between four and twelve million animals culled), despite the fact that the liquid waste events do not result in the simultaneous infection of more than two farms from the initial release, the resultant impact is significantly higher. The results from these release events should be considered cautiously because the model assumes that the 477 Updated SSRA agricultural industry around the NBAF operates normally after the catastrophic event (except for the implementation of control measures). That is, the havoc unleashed by the large tornado or earthquake does not alter the number of animals sold or visited by service providers and does not alter the locations of the animals (animals are not killed and fences are not destroyed by the disaster). Moreover, the release of FMDv from the NBAF may be attended by the release of several other pathogens, some of which are zoonotic, so business as usual will certainly not occur because of the hazards to agricultural workers nearby. 6.2.1.1 Effect of Conservative Parameters As described in the methods, uncertainty underlies many parameters used in the model. When insufficient evidence was available to choose among a variety of possible values for a parameter, in general, the most conservative value was chosen (that is, the parameter that leads to the largest disease conservative value better reflected reality. For example, there is little evidence underpinning the degree to which indirect contact between farms can be controlled after an outbreak. In this case, a relatively modest reduction to indirect contact was chosen out of many possible values, which allows the outbreak to continue even after detection. Because conservative values are often used, the consequences of a real outbreak of FMD may be smaller than is predicted here. However, as shown in the sensitivity analysis section below, the change of any particular parameter to a value less conservative than the baseline usually reduces the consequences of only a few types of outbreaks (those starting in particular locations or only if the median NAADSM output is considered). Even when the results are sensitive to the change of a parameter, the degree to which the results change is almost always less than an order of magnitude for all outbreak starting locations, vaccination strategies applied or NAADSM outputs. For this reason, even though conservative parameter values were sometimes chosen, the results described here are likely to approximate the results of an outbreak controlled under more optimistic circumstances unless all values chosen were overly conservative. Moreover, insofar as this approach does over-estimate the consequences of an outbreak, it may partially compensates for the inability to account for the contribution of wildlife in the model (as described in section 6.2.1.3, below), which may exacerbate an outbreak but is not accounted for in our modeling. 6.2.1.2 Modeling the Consequence of Large Outbreaks As discussed above, the Updated SSRA model predicts that millions of animals would be culled in many of the outbreaks resulting from the NBAF FMDv events evaluated. Most animals are culled because they were infected or were part of an infected herd. Because culling capacity is relatively low, compared to the number of herds that need to be culled, the model predicts that herds are often culled even though the virus is no longer circulating in the herd (all animals were infected, recovered and were naturally immune by the time the herd was destroyed). Additionally, a minority of animals would be culled because of contact between a non-infected herd and an infected herd. No one has developed a module for NAADSM that enables the model to choose options other than culling for the final disposition of herds that are naturally immune after infection. The model also predicts that many millions of animals may be vaccinated during the outbreak. 478 Updated SSRA For small outbreaks, the culling of thousands of animals may be the most effective means to rid FMD and enable the fastest recovery of the livestock industry in the U.S. However, there are only a few circumstances in which the culling of millions of animals would be the best means to control a large outbreak while supporting the recovery of the livestock industry. In the face of a large outbreak, USDA policy can accommodate a variety of strategies to minimize the economic consequences of an outbreak while simultaneously reducing its extent and duration. These strategies may include mass culling of some types of herds, and the slaughter and sale of other herds, depending on market forces and how the approach would enable the U.S. to most quickly recapture its key export markets. Similarly, the final disposition of millions of vaccinated animals will depend on the role of those animals within the livestock industry and market forces. One option may be chosen for dairy herds, another for sheep, and yet another for swine. These options may be different, depending on the size and location of the herds in the U.S. To our knowledge, no one has developed a version of NAADSM that can reflect this complex and dynamic decision making process, and therefore the results presented in this study simply report animals involved in the outbreak and its control as culled or vaccinated. In a real response, many of the animals predicted to be culled by the Updated SSRA model may enter the market. 6.2.1.3 How Wildlife May Affect the Results As described in the methods section (6.1), and further in the appendix, Kansas and the surrounding states support a relatively large population of and variety of wildlife species susceptible to FMD, ! developed a version of NAADSM that quantitatively includes the contribution of wildlife to an outbreak of FMD. Given the data collected on these wildlife populations, an outbreak of FMD may not be as easy to control as predicted by the model presented here. At the very least, the presence of wildlife provides more opportunity for the pathogen to spread through na\u00efve hosts and be perpetuated in the environment. That being said, the contribution of wildlife to the duration and extent of outbreaks in Europe is uncertain. For example, none of the samples taken from wildlife during and after the FMD outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2001 showed evidence of infection [Kitching, 2002]. Wildlife could contribute to the risk of an FMD outbreak in several unique and consequential ways. Wildlife populations, especially deer, can be found in parts of the area around the NBAF that are not home to domestic species. Therefore, the chance that a release of FMDv would initiate an outbreak is increased because areas that are currently modeled to not host susceptible species could be visited by susceptible wildlife during a release event. Additionally, if an outbreak of FMD begins in wildlife, the fact that these animals are observed more rarely and less closely than domestic species implies that the outbreak may be detected relatively late. Moreover, in some areas, wildlife enters (or contacts the fence-line of) premises where susceptible species are kept. The extensive range of many wildlife species implies that a single infected wildlife herd could come into close proximity with many susceptible domestic herds. Wildlife therefore affords 479 Table 6.2.1 -1: Summary of Disease Duration Estimates across Events Name Events Shortest duration (p5 locations -p5 NAADSM output) Median duration (p50 BSL-3Ag AA10 High days 533 days Aerosol Non Containment OA2, OA3 28 Aerosol Necropsy Aerosol BSL-3E/BSL -3E SP Solid Waste Transfer Station NA10 (High) 79 days 424 days 533 days EA10 (High) 79 days 424 days 533 days NSW4 -NSW6, NST2 -NST4, 13 days 24 days 533 days Updated SSRA another mechanism for direct contact between infected species that is not accounted for in the model (although the degree to which this actually occurs and the risk from such contacts is uncertain). This direct contact will not be controllable by efforts to limit the shipment of animals after an infection. Lastly, because these animals are wild, they are more difficult to find and cull than domestic animals. If this measure is chosen for disease control, additional manpower will be required to control FMD infection circulating in wildlife, the personnel involved may be separate and non-overlapping with those required to control infection amongst domestic animals. For example, sharpshooters, hunters and game wardens may have the primary responsibility to control infection in wildlife and these roles are not considered critical to the control of the outbreak in domestic animals. 6.2.1.4 Summary of Results by Event The results across all release events are shown in the summary tables below (Tables 6.2.1-1, 6.2.1-2, and 6.2.1-3) for disease duration (which measures how long new infections continue to occur in livestock), head culled and head vaccinated across all seven modeled states. Results are shown given uncertainty in starting location (which includes the degree to which the disease spreads to other states) and NAADSM output. When considering disease duration, note that all release events modeled cause outbreaks that last the same amount of time when the worst reasonable starting location (p95 location) and worst reasonable NAADSM output (p95) is considered. These worst case outbreaks all spread to several other states and the same location (the p95 location in the other states) is the focus of the infection in the other states regardless of how the outbreak evolves in Kansas when the p95 outputs are considered. The outbreak in the other states last longer than any outbreak in Kansas and therefore the duration of the outbreak is defined by the duration of the outbreak in these other states and not the duration in Kansas. This phenomenon is most obvious when considering the p95 starting locations and p95 NAADSM output because less consequential outbreaks do not necessarily spread to other states, or, when they do spread, start in less consequential locations in other states. 480 Table 6.2.1 -1: Summary of Disease Duration Estimates across Events Name Events Shortest duration Median duration Longe st duration (p5 locations Solid Waste days -NST4, ES4-ES6 EL5 EL5 533 days 62 days 533 days Tornado High T-High 240 days 424 days 533 days Earthquake High E-High 8 days 59 Culled Estimates Across Events Name Events Least head culled Median head culled Most head T-High 270,000 2,200, 000 Summary of Head Vaccinated Estimate Across Events Name Events Least head Median head Most head vaccinated vaccinated vaccinated (p5 locations -p5 (p50 Summary of Head Vaccinated Estimate Across Events Name Events Least head Median head Most head vaccinated vaccinated vaccinated (p5 locations -p5 (p50 High T-High 380,000 25,000,000 6.2.2 Comparing SSRA Results to those of Other Modeling Teams Modeling was used in this study primarily to identify the release pathways of greatest risk and to ascertain the relative importance of control and mitigation measures to reduce the risk of performing cutting-edge science with high-consequence livestock pathogens at the NBAF. For this reason, the absolute impact of any outbreak predicted by the models used is less important than the relative impact between events and the reduction in impact that various control and mitigation measures afford, as explained in the Cost-Benefit section (6.3). Given the primary purpose of the study, comparing th e results with models analyzing the impact of outbreaks in different geographic areas would not augment the analysis. Given the complexity and scale of U.S. agriculture and irreducible uncertainty in parameterizing some aspects of an FMD outbreak (e.g. What is the chance than an infected deer would infect a nearby cattle herd?), no model can predict the extent or duration of an outbreak in the U.S. with certainty and the models used in the Updated SSRA are no exception. To determine why two model results differ is extremely difficult and beyond the scope of this analysis. Even if two models were given the exact same question (the consequences of an outbreak starting in a feedlot in Manhattan, for example), understanding why they produce different results requires extensive testing of BOTH models (the manipulation of input variables to determine the consequences on the results) and, likely, access to the code underlying the models. Without these resources, any hypothesis regarding the reasons behind the differences in output between two models would simply be conjecture. 484 Updated SSRA Achieving the best prediction possible of the scale and duration of a possible FMD outbreak in the U.S. will however support decision-making related to livestock disease control in general. From scrutinizing the similarities and differences of several modeling approaches (and the consequent results) a better estimate of a true value could be obtained. Over the next few years, parallel estimation (by different teams) of the scale and duration of an outbreak starting at the NBAF (or from any accidental introduction area within the U.S.) would advance this effort. 6.2.3 FMD Epidemiological Impact by NA10, EA10, OA2, OA3) In this section, the results of epidemiological modeling of all aerosol release events, except those caused by natural disasters such as tornado or earthquake, are presented. Aerosol releases caused by natural disasters, such as these, are self-announcing (it is obvious to everyone that the incident occurred) and would likely trigger disease control measures even prior to the first infection. For these reasons, releases triggered by natural disasters are considered separately. Many non-catastrophic aerosol release events resulted in the release of material insufficient to cause an infection downwind for any meteorological condition modeled and for any infection threshold considered (each threshold is a function of herd size, as discussed above). Those release events are described in the Section 5, but the associated epidemiological impact is not modeled (because no infections were caused). For those (non-natural disaster related) aerosol events that did result in a release of sufficient material for potential downwind infection (within containment), a complete HEPA filtration failure had to occur (Events AA10, NA10, and EA10). The resulting frequency of an initial infection given total HEPA filtration failure is estimated at less than once every trillion years (~1x10 -30); given this extreme improbability of occurrence, these events were not considered credible and were not carried through economic analysis. However, to be certain that this was an appropriate approach, epidemiological modeling was performed on these events. The results presented below indicate that even though these events lead to a significant outbreak, they are within an order of magnitude of the impact observed with all other events evaluated; with the corresponding frequency of infection being so low, these events would not be expected to result in significant risk. 6.2.3.2 Aerosol Releases from BSL-3Ag Animal Holding Rooms (Event AA10 \u2014High Q). Of the releases modeled, only the release that involves the total failure of the HEPA filtration system causes enough infectious material to be released so that an infection is calculated to occur outside the NBAF, and even in that case, only the high-value source term releases a sufficient amount to cause a downwind infection. However, if this event occurs, it can be very serious because many premises may be simultaneously infected by the aerosol release. Table 6.2.3-1 shows the probability that meteorological conditions transport enough material from this event to infect at least a single premises (and at least a given number of premises simultaneously). The probability of at least one downwind infection occurring is nearly 95%. Also, many meteorological conditions lead to several premises infected downwind simultaneously by this release (and in fact, most conditions lead to five or more 485 Tab le 6.2.3-3: Dura tion of Disea se Outbreak s from an Infection Initiated by an Aer osol Releas e from an AHR Duration is given for several starting l ocation combination s (due to the possibility of spread to other states) using the p5, p50, and p95 N AADSM outputs.

Because this release is surreptitious, this unlikely event can have significant consequences due to the explosive starting conditions. Table 6.2.3 -1: Probability that Meteorological Conditions will Prevail to Cause at least a Threshold Number of Initial Premises Infected upon an Aerosol Release from an AHR Probability This release occurs without the knowledge of the surrounding community, and therefore the infections that occur could be missed by the affected producers. For this reason, infected animals may be shipped to other states before the outbreak is noticed, spreading the illness to these other states. The probability of interstate spread of FMD in this event is shown in Table 6.2.3- 2.

An infection is calculated to occur in only one possible location from this release, and the necessary associated meteorological conditions prevail only 0.1% of the time that the releases occur. That is, for 99.9% of releases, the wind does not transport enough material to a livestock premises to result in an infection. This release occurs without the knowledge of the surrounding community, and therefore the infections that occur could be missed by the affected producers. For this reason, infected animals may be shipped to other states before the outbreak is noticed, spreading the illness to these other states. The probability of interstate spread of FMD in this event is shown in Table 6.2.3- 4. Table 6.2.3 -4: Probability of Interstate Spread of FMD from an Infe ction Initiated by an Aerosol Release from the BSL -3Ag Necropsy Suite The probability of spread to other states is given using the p5, p50, and p95 NAADSM outputs.

Using the p5 NAADSM output, even if the disease spreads to other states, the outbreak lasts longer in Kansas than the other states, so there is no change in outbreak duration. Whereas, using the median NAADSM output, outbreaks in other states last longer than the outbreak in Kansas and so outbreak duration is determined by the length of the outbreak in the secondary states and the probability that it spreads there (which occurs in the median starting location case). Figure 6.2.3-2 shows head culled and vaccinated for the outbreaks initiated by a release from the BSL\u00ad 3 Ag Necropsy Suite across all three NAADSM output percentiles. Using a particular NAADSM output, not much variability is observed in the impact. Essentially, the slight differences in impact, from the lowest impact starting locations to the highest, result from the spread to other states. Using the p95 NAADSM output, no variance is observed because almost all outbreaks spread to all other states modeled. Using the other two NAADSM outputs presented, the additional impact observed occurs when the disease spreads to other states. Although six different secondary state combinations are represented in the lines on the graph, the differences in the impact in those states is relatively small. Figure 6.2.3-2: Head Culled (Left) and Vaccinated (Right) for Outbreaks Initiated by an Aerosol Release from the BSL-3Ag Necropsy Suite The variability observed within a NAADSM output line is largely due to the risk of spread from Kansas to other states. 488 Updated SSRA 6.2.3.4 Releases from the BSL-3E/BSL-3E SP Rooms (Event EA10) As in the aerosol releases modeled from AHR and Non-Containment, of the BSL-3 aerosol releases modeled, only the release that occurs due to a total failure of the HEPA filtration system causes enough infectious material to be released so that an infection is calculated to occur outside the NBAF, and even in that case, only the high-value source term releases a sufficient amount to cause a downwind infection. An infection is calculated to occur in only one possible location from this release, and the necessary associated meteorological conditions prevail only 0.1% of the time that the releases occur. That is, for 99.9% of releases, the wind does not transport enough material to a livestock premises to result in an infection. This is the same premises that is infected by the releases from the BSL-3Ag Necropsy Room under the same weather conditions, so the results for this event are identical to those above. 6.2.3.5 Non-Containment Releases (Events OA2, OA3) Of the aerosol releases modeled, only those that involve the failure of primary and secondary containment cause enough infectious material to be released so that an infection is calculated to occur outside the NBAF, and even in those cases (AA10, NA10, ANC10), only the high-value Q source term releases a sufficient amount to cause a downwind infection. An infection is calculated to occur in only one of two possible locations from this release, and the necessary associated meteorological conditions prevail only 0.4% of the time that the releases occur. That is, for 99.6% of releases, the wind does not transport enough material to a livestock premises to result in an infection. In this section, the epidemiological impact of releases that result in at least one infection are described. The two locations that could be infected by the aerosol (based on meteorological conditions) are very different from each other in terms of herd size and type of operation. If the smaller of the two premises is initially infected, the median outbreak leads to the destruction of less than one million animals in Kansas. If the larger of the two premises is initially infected, the median outbreak leads to the destruction of many millions of animals in Kansas alone. Given this difference, the aleatory uncertainty depicted by the starting location is significant. This release occurs without the knowledge of the surrounding community; and therefore, the infections that occur could be missed by the affected producers. For this reason, infected animals may be shipped to other states before the outbreak is noticed, spreading the illness to those states. Once again, the differences between the two possible starting premises significantly change the consequences of the outbreak, as outbreaks beginning in the smaller location are five-fold more likely to be contained in Kansas. The probability of interstate spread of FMD in this event is shown in Table 6.2.3- 6. 489 Table 6.2.3 -7: Duration of Outbreaks from an Infection Initiated by an Aerosol Release from Non -Containment Duration is given for several starting location combinations (due to the possibility of spread to other states) using the p5, p50 , and p95 output p50 NAADSM output p95 (including risk of movement to other states) p5 28 days 83 days 492 days p50 48 days 424 days 492 days p95 420 days 473 days 533 days Updated SSRA Table 6.2.3 -6: Probability of Interstate Spread of FMD from an Infection Initiated by an Aerosol Release from Non -Containment The probability of spread to other states is given for using the p5, p50, and p95 NAADSM outputs.

NAADSM output p5 NAADSM output spread to 78% 90% 100% other states The possible duration of the disease outbreak is shown in Table 6.2.3-7.

Because the factors leading to the release are distinct for each release location, the events are modeled separately. The epidemiological consequences of these two release events differ because they are considered to begin in different types of facilities in different locations. These two sets of results are discussed below. 6.2.3.6 Solid Waste Releases from the Transfer Station (AS5-AS6, NSW4- NSW6, NST2 - NST4, ES4-ES6) The facility that may be infected by the release is a relatively small goat facility, so the consequences of the outbreak are comparatively small (but still significant). The p5 NAADSM output predicts that this outbreak will occur but that it will not spread to other facilities and the goats will become naturally immune before FMD spreads to any other location. In more consequential outbreaks, infected animals may be shipped to other states before the outbreak is noticed, spreading the illness to these other states. The probability of interstate spread of FMD in this event is shown in Table 6.2.3-8. Note that only the highest-consequence output from NAADSM predicts a significant probability of spread from outbreaks starting at this facility and spreading to other states. Table 6.2.3 -8: Probability of Interstate Spread of FMD from an Infection Initiated by Release of Infectious Solid Waste at the Transfer Station The probability of spread to other states is given for using the p5, p50, and p95 NAADSM outputs . Although the probability of spread to other states is never truly 0% , the probability is so small that it is considered 0% for this analysis . NAADSM output p5 NAADSM spread to 0% 0% 61% other states The possible duration of the disease outbreak is shown in Table 6.2.3-9. The total disease outbreak duration is a function of the duration of the outbreak within Kansas, and, if it spreads to another state, the duration of the outbreak in that state. Because there is one possible starting location in this event and the median and lower outputs predict no spread to other states, the duration is completely defined by the duration of the outbreak in Kansas for those NAADSM outputs. 491 Updated SSRA Figure 6.2.3-4 shows head culled and vaccinated for the outbreaks initiated by a release of infectious waste from the transfer station across three NAADSM output percentiles. Using a particular NAADSM output, not much variability is observed in the impact. If the outbreak can be identified and contained in Kansas, the consequences are relatively minor. Should the outbreak spread to other states (60% of cases for the p95 NAADSM output), the consequences can be almost as large as any other release event. Figure 6.2.3-4: Head Culled (Left) and Vaccinated (Right) for Outbreaks Initiated by Release of Infectious Solid Waste from the Transfer Station The variability observed within a NAADSM output line is largely due to the risk of spread from Kansas to other states. 6.2.3.7 Solid Waste Releases from the Landfill (AS5- AS6, NSW4 -NSW6, NST2-NST4, ES4 - ES6) The facility that may be infected by the solid waste landfill release is a relatively small swine facility. In the more consequential outbreaks, infected animals may be shipped to other states before the outbreak is noticed, spreading the illness to these other states. The probability of interstate spread of FMD in this event is shown in Table 6.2.3-10. Note that the lowest-consequence output from NAADSM predicts nearly no probability of spread from outbreaks starting at this facility to other states, whereas the highest consequence outbreaks nearly always spread to other states even though the outbreak is starting at the same location. Table 6.2.3 -10: Probability of Interstate Spread of FMD from an Infection Initiated by Release of Infectious Solid Waste from the Landfill The pro bability of spread to other states is given for using the p5, p50, and other states 492 Table 6.2.3 -11: Duration of Outbreaks from an Infection Initiated by a Release of Infectious Solid Waste from the Landfill Duration is given for several starting location combinations (due to the possibility of spread to ot her states) using the p5, p50, and p95 NAADSM output p50 NAADSM output p95 (including risk of movement to other states) p5 13 days 48 days 275 days p50 13 days 147 days 492 days p95 13 days 473 days 533 days Updated SSRA The possible duration of the disease outbreak is shown in Table 6.2.3-11. The total disease outbreak duration is a function of the duration of the outbreak within Kansas, and, if it spreads to another state, the duration of the outbreak in that state. Because outbreaks in other states are predicted to last longer than an outbreak in Kansas starting in this facility, the outbreak duration is defined by the possibility of spread to other states (for example, the p50 starting locations and p50 output predicts the spread of the disease from Kansas to Iowa alone, where the outbreak lasts 147 days). Figure 6.2.3-5 shows head culled and vaccinated for the outbreaks initiated by a release of infectious wast e from the landfill across three NAADSM output percentiles. Because there is just one starting location in Kansas for this outbreak, the consequences are defined by the risk (probability and consequences) of the disease spreading to the other states. Figure 6.2.3-5: Head Culled (Left) and Vaccinated (Right) for Outbreaks Initiated by Release of Infectious Solid Waste from the Landfill The variability observed within a NAADSM output line is largely due to the risk of spread from Kansas to other states. 493 Updated SSRA Liquid Waste Release Events (Events AL3-AL4, AL7-AL8, NL3-NL4, NL6- NL8, EL5) In the liquid waste release events, the release can occur anywhere along the line that runs from the NBAF to the treatment plant or along the creek that flows nearby (see Section 5 Fate and Transport). Because the factors leading to the release are distinct for each release location, the events are modeled separately. In this section, the consequences for a release at each location are discussed in turn; by proximity to the NBAF (Liquid Waste A is the release closest to the NBAF and Liquid Waste D is the release furthest from). Although all the liquid waste releases infect at most a single premises, in two locations, these premises hold more than one species, so are modeled as two locations (a cattle location combined with either a swine location or a sheep and a goat location) at the same spot. These events have a 50% probability of starting in each species. 6.2.3.8 Liquid Waste Location A (Events AL3-AL4, AL7-AL8, NL3-NL4, NL7-NL8, EL5) The facility that may be infected by this release is a relatively small facility that houses sheep and goats. In the more consequential outbreaks, infected animals may be shipped to other states before the outbreak is noticed, spreading the illness to these other states. The probability of interstate spread of FMD in this event is shown in Table 6.2.3-12. Note that the lowest-consequence output from NAADSM predicts nearly no probability of spread from outbreaks starting at this facility to other states.

In the more consequential outbreaks, infected animals may be shipped to other states before the outbreak is noticed, spreading the illness to these other states. The probability of interstate spread of FMD in this event is shown in Table 6.2.3-14. Note that the lowest-consequence output from NAADSM predicts nearly no probability of spread from outbreaks starting at this facility to other states.

Infected animals may be shipped to other states before the outbreak is noticed, spreading the illness to these other states. The probability of interstate spread of FMD in this event is shown in Table 6.2.3-16. Note that even the lowest-consequence output from NAADSM predicts a significant risk of spread to other states. 496 Table 6.2.3 -17: Duration of Outbreaks from an Infection Initiated by Release of Infectious Liquid Waste from Location C Duration is given for several starting location combinations (due to the possibility of spread to other states) using the p5, p50, and p95 NAADSM output p50 NAADSM output p95 (including risk of movement to other states) p5 188 days 280 days 492 days p50 188 days 424 days 492 days p95 188 days 473 days 533 days Updated SSRA Table 6.2.3 -16: Probability of Interstate Spread of FMD from an Infection Initiated by Release of Infectious Liquid Waste from Location C The probability of spread to other states is given for using the p5, p50, and p95 NAAD SM outputs.

For the p5 NAADSM output, outbreaks in Kansas last longer than outbreaks outside of Kansas; for other outputs, the duration is defined by the risk of spread to other states, even though the median starting locations for the p5 output includes the spread to five other states.

This release event could occur with infectious material carried by a person on a fomite, by a person with contamination on the hand, foot, other body part or in the respiratory system (human vector). As described in the methods in Section 6.1, the possible starting locations of the initial transference driven infection wer e determined by interviewing personnel on the K-State campus (those who work on livestock disease and personnel in general) to identify all the locations where they may encounter livestock. It was found that, although many people contact livestock near Manhattan, others contact animals in nearly every part of Kansas. Much of the variance in the data shown in the section below is dependent on the type of premises initially infected and its location. The location of the first infected premises does not depend \u0011 does not vary depending on how the contamination event occurred, the epidemiological consequences provided below are applicable to all transference events. Infected animals may be shipped to other states before the outbreak is noticed, spreading the illness to these other states. The probability of interstate spread of FMD in this event is shown in Table 6.2.3-20. 499 Table 6.2.3 -21: Duration of Outbreaks from an Infection Initiated from Tran sference Events Duration is given for several starting location combinations (due to the possibility of spread to other states) using the p5, p50, and p95 NAADSM outputs.

The total disease outbreak duration is a function of the duration of the outbreak within Kansas, and, if it spreads to another state, the duration of the outbreak in that state. For the p5 NAADSM output, outbreaks in Kansas last longer than outbreaks outside of Kansas, for other outputs, the duration is defined by the risk of spread to other states. Figure 6.2.3-10 shows head culled and vaccinated for the outbreaks initiated from transference events acro ss all possible starting locations and for three NAADSM output percentiles. The consequences in each NAADSM output line vary because the outbreak can begin in one of several locations and because the risk of disease spread to other states. Figure 6.2.3-10: Head Culled (Left) and Vaccinated (Right) for Outbreaks Initiated from Transference Events Aerosol Releases Due to Natural Disasters (Events T- Medium, T-High, E-High) A few release events involve a natural disaster striking the NBAF and causing a disruption of containment (which results in the aerosol release of FMDv). These releases are modeled separately from other aerosol releases because they are self-announcing. That is, it is obvious to the emergency response community that a tornado has struck the NBAF and that it would be prudent to take preemptive disease control measures. To reflect this heightened awareness of a potential outbreak, two modeling methods were used as detailed previously in the methods (Section 6.1). First, movement control restrictions could be preemptively emplaced on all premises that may be affected by the release 500 Updated SSRA event. Secondly, observation and reporting probabilities could be preemptively increased to reflect the in the methods). Both options are explored below. The effect of preemptive controls enabled by a self-announcing release is shown below as a function of the number of premises infected in Figure 6.2.3-11. In all cases, 108 PFU are released. In the baseline case (the nominal condition in which no preemptive control measures are enacted and all control parameters are in their normal value), the event is surreptitious (such as the release from the animal holding room --Event AA10). In a self-announcing case, the outbreak could be detected immediately that although the impact of the outbreak started in a large number of premises are similar in surreptitious and self-announcing events, the consequences of outbreaks that start in 30 or fewer premises is much less when the event is self-announcing than in events that are surreptitious. In fact, the impact of the p5 outbreaks in a surreptitious event is as consequential as the median outbreaks from self-announcing events. Outbreaks that begin in more than 30 premises are difficult to control and the preemptive movement controls have little effect. Further, note how, for both methods of modeling preemptive movement, restrictions produce similar outcomes. Figure 6.2.3-11: Impact in Kansas of Surreptitious (baseline) and Self-Announcing (unicorn and min mv). Releases of 108 PFU of FMDv from the NBAF as a Function of Initial Premises Infected For releases in which the primary aerosol infects fewer than 30 farms, the consequences of the outbreak are much reduced in a self-announcing event compared to a surreptitious event. 501 Updated SSRA It should be noted that modeling the release of FMDv from the NBAF due to a natural disaster is of limited value because of the significant disruption that the natural disaster itself will cause. For example, a large tornadic event will undoubtedly break fences, incapacitate producers, scatter livestock, and otherwise disrupt the normal function of the agricultural system. Moreover, an event that causes the release of FMDv from the NBAF due to a disruption of the building envelope may also to release a variety of other non-zoonotic and zoonotic infectious disease agents (although work with infected larg e animals is likely to be limited to two different high consequence pathogens at a time due to space constraints, infected small animals and pathogen stock may be released). Therefore, a large FMD outbreak may need to be controlled in the context of other outbreaks, some of which pose a health risk to the responders. In general, agricultural business- as-usual is unlikely to continue after a significant natural disaster striking the NBAF, but this fact is not reflected in the modeling itself. 6.2.3.12 Tornado (Medium Q Release \u2014Event T-Medium) In this event, a significant tornado results in the release of ~108 PFU of FMDv (the medium Q source term). Due to the amount of material released, the number of farms initially infected downwind is large with most meteorological conditions leading to the initial infection of more than five farms (Table 6.2.3\u00ad 22). Table 6.2.3 -22: Probability that Meteorological Conditions will Prevail to Cause at Least a Threshold Number of Initial Premises Infected upon a Medium Aeros ol Release Caused by a Tornado Probability Even though preemptive control measures are in place, because so many premises are infected initially, the disease can still spread to other states. This probability is given in Table 6.2.3-23, below.

The total disease outbreak duration is a function of the duration of the outbreak within Kansas, and, if it spreads to another state, the duration of the outbreak in that state. Because the disease may spread to other states that were not initially affected by the release, these states are modeled to not take preemptive control measures and therefore the disease spreads as if it were introduced by a surreptitious release. 502 Tab le 6.2.3-24: Dura tion o f Out break s from an Infection I nitiated by a Medium Aerosol Releas e Caus ed b y a Tornado Duration is given for several starting l ocation combination s (due to the possibility of spread to other states) using the p5, p50, and p95 N AADSM outputs.

Figure 6.2.3-12: Head Culled (Left) and Vaccinated (Right) for Outbreaks Initiated by a Medium Aerosol Release from a Tornado 6.2.3.13 Tornado (High Q Release \u2014Event T-High) In this event, a significant tornado results in the release of ~1010 PFU of FMDv. Due to the amount of material released, the number of farms initially infected downwind is very large with most releases leading to the simultaneous initial infection of 50 or more farms (Table 6.2.3-25). Table 6.2.3 -25: Probability that Meteorological Conditions will Prevail to Cause at Least a Threshold Number o f Initial Premises Infected after a High Aerosol Release Caused by a Tornado Probability Even though preemptive control measures are in place, because so many premises are infected initially, the probability that the disease will spread to other states is still significant. This probability is given in Table 6.2.3-26, below. 503 Table 6.2.3 -27: Duration of Outbreaks from an Infection Initiated by a High Aerosol Release Caused by a Tornado Duration is given for several starting loc ation combinations (due to the possibility of spread to other states) using the p5, p50, and p95 NAADSM output p50 NAADSM output p95 (including risk of movement to other states) p5 240 days 272 days 333 days p50 252 days 424 days 492 days p95 252 days 473 days 533 Table 6.2.3 -26: Probabi lity that FMD will Spread to Other States from a High Aerosol Release Caused by a Tornado NAADSM output p5 NAADSM output p50 spread to 70% 92% 96% other states The possible duration of the disease outbreak is shown in Table 6.2.3-27. The total disease duration is a function of the duration of the outbreak within Kansas, and, if it spreads to another state, the duration of the outbreak in that state. Because the disease may spread to other states that were not initially affected by the release, these states are modeled to not take preemptive control measures and therefore the disease spreads as if it were introduced by a surreptitious release. Even though the tornado is a self-announcing event, the fact that more than 50 premises are initially in fected by the material dispersed by the tornado makes this outbreak very difficult to control. Figure 6.2.3-13 shows head culled and vaccinated for the outbreaks initiated from a high aerosol release due to tornados across all possible starting locations and for three NAADSM output percentiles.

Due to the amount of material released, several farms can be initially infected downwind (Table 6.2.3-28). Table 6.2.3 -28: Probability that Meteorological Conditions will Cause at Least a Threshold Number of Initia l Premises Infected upon a High Aerosol Release Caused by an Earthquake Probability Despite this explosive beginning, this event is easier to control than the aerosol release from the animal holding room in the absence of functioning HEPA filtration (event AA10) even though the same amount of material is released. This is because preemptive control measures can be enacted in this self- announcing case. The spread from many premises to areas distal from the NBAF does present some (albeit reduced) probability that the disease will spread to other states. This probability is given in Table 6.2.3-29, below. Table 6.2.3 -29: Probabi lity that FMD will Spread to Other States Upon a High Ae rosol Release Caused by an Earthquake NAADSM output p5 NAADSM output p50 spread to 13% 22% 42% other states The possible duration of the disease outbreak is shown in Table 6.2.3-30. The total disease duration is a function of the duration of the outbreak within Kansas, and, if it spreads to another state, the duration of the outbreak in that state. Because the disease may spread to other states that were not initially affected by the release, these states are modeled to not take preemptive control measures and therefore the disease spreads as if it were introduced by a surreptitious release. 505 Updated SSRA Because an earthquake is a self-announcing event, most outbreaks due to the resulting release are relatively small (median impact of less than one million head culled) despite the fact that many premises can be infected simultaneously by the release itself. Figure 6.2.3-14 shows head culled and vaccinated for the outbreaks initiated from large releases due to earthquakes across all possible starting locations and for three NAADSM output percentiles. Figure 6.2.3-14: Head Culled (Left) and Vaccinated (Right) for Outbreaks Initiated by a High Aerosol Release Caused by an Earthquake 506 Updated SSRA 6.3 Cost-Benefit and Sensitivity Analyses In this section, the effect of changing the modeling parameters used in the baseline analysis is explored. In some cases, the change of an input parameter can simultaneously explore potential benefits of implementing additional outbreak detection/control measures, as well as illuminate how uncertainty could affect the baseline modeling results. That is, exploring the effect of greater or lesser (than baseline) culling rates informs how uncertainty in the baseline value may reduce the confidence in any particular result, while simultaneously illuminating the affect of culling rate investment. Increasing the culling rate may reduce the impact of an outbreak; failure to invest in the maintenance of culling capacity may exacerbate an outbreak. Recall that the Updated SSRA team did not explore how changes in a vaccination strategy affect the outbreak because that topic is so complex that it cannot be treated fairly in the context of a larger risk assessment. However, each of the analyses described below was performed in the context of the three plausible vaccination strategies used in this report to ensure that the conclusions hold, regardless of how vaccination proceeds. When the costs of improving disease control or detection systems are discussed, only the pre-outbreak costs are considered because cost is a secondary factor in decision-making in the face of an ongoing emergency. Pre-event costs are especially important when they support the response to low-probability, high-consequence events such as the outbreaks described in this report (because the expenditure will not have a real value if the event never occurs). For outbreak detection systems, almost all costs are realized before the event occurs. For outbreak response systems, pre-event costs typically include the training of responders, and the purchase and maintenance/storage of equipment and supplies. Costs to field culling teams and replace consumables used in the management of the outbreak would be realized only if the outbreak occurs and are not considered here. 6.3.1 Considering Large Outbreaks Once an outbreak reaches a certain size, it is limited in extent by the availability of susceptible animals. In our model, once an outbreak involves the culling of about seven million animals in Kansas, it has reached nearly its maximum size and can worsen only marginally thereafter. For some starting locations, like large feedlots, NAADSM predicts that an outbreak would probably reach that maximum size; that is, the median NAADSM output predicts over seven million animals culled. In these cases, even if an enhanced mitigation measure drops the average consequences of an outbreak, the median consequences may not change significantly (see Figure 6.3.1-1). In the case illustrated in the figure below, the improvement does drop the average outbreak consequences, but still more than 50% of the outbreaks result in approximately seven million animals culled. In short, the entire consequence curve shifts to the right (the outbreaks with the greatest consequences occur at higher percentile outputs). However, if just the p50 output is considered, no benefit would be observed. For this reason, we test the value of mitigation measures against a variety of NAADSM outputs in this section. Clearly, the most valuable mitigation measures would reduce the consequences of even the worst outbreaks. However, measures that mitigate the consequences of only the less severe outbreaks still have value in many cases and, in fact, make the probability that an outbreak would reach its maximum size less likely. 507 Updated SSRA Figure 6.3.1-1: Consequences as a Function of the Percentile of the NAADSM Output for a Notional Large Outbreak with Baseline Parameters and in the Context of a Notional Improved Mitigation System Note that although the improvement reduces the average outbreak consequences, the median consequences are still roughly the same. Simply put, the entire curve is shifted to the right (higher consequences occur only at greater output percentiles) as indicated by the arrow. 6.3.2 Effect of Culling Rate Although the Updated SSRA team collected a significant amount of data to predict the number of premises that could be depopulated each day in an FMD outbreak, the fact that the model used does not distinguish large and small premises depopulation, and the fact that the U.S. has never had an outbreak that required the depopulation of more than 100,000 animals, brings into question the accuracy of the parameters used when applied to the control of a real outbreak. Moreover, because the fielding of culling teams requires the interplay of state and federal resources in an outbreak that may involve many states, predicting the true culling rate before an event occurs is complex. For this reason, the Updated SSRA team explored the effect of changes in the baseline culling rate in outbreaks in Kansas, from half the baseline rate to up to 10-fold more herds culled per day. Recall that the average 508 Updated SSRA culling rate in the states we examined is approximately three to four herds per day, per state involved in the outbreak. This analysis, therefore, explores culling rates of two to 40 herds per day, on average. 6.3.2.1 Effect of Changing the Culling Rate The culling rate was reduced by as much as half and increased by as much as 10-fold in this analysis. In Figure 6.3.2-1, the effect of culling rate on outbreak duration is displayed relative to the duration when baseline parameters are used (a value of two indicates that the outbreak now lasts twice as long). Each line represents a different outbreak starting facility type, notional vaccination strategy, and percentile of NAADSM outputs. The effect of changing the culling rate is significant across all facility types, vaccination strategies, and most NAADSM outputs considered (for very small outbreaks, like the cow- calf p5 output, there is no effect of increasing or decreasing the culling rate). Specifically, up to three\u00ad fold increases in culling rate decrease the outbreak duration by more than a factor of 10. Similarly, if the predicted (baseline) culling rate cannot be achieved, the outbreak will last longer, by as much as 30-fold. Figure 6.3.2-1: Effect of Changes to the Culling Rate on Outbreak Duration in Kansas All axes are relative to the baseline culling rate (results that lie along y=1 have no effect on duration compared to baseline, like the cow-calf p5 line). Each line represents either a unique combination of outbreak starting facility type, NAADSM output, or vaccination strategy (vaccination strategy A was used unless otherwise noted). 509 Updated SSRA Because outbreak duration is defined not only by the time that the outbreak continues to spread to new farms, but also the time required to depopulate all farms that have been infected, it is assumed that culling rate would affect outbreak duration even if culling rate did not affect the number of farms that become infected. This is one of the reasons why disease duration (which reflects how long a virus circulates in the population) was used as the main output in the results section. In fact, culling rate has a significant effect on the total number of animals culled, as well as outbreak duration, suggesting that culling rate is important for the control of the outbreak itself, not just the depopulation of herds that were infected (as shown in Figure 6.3.2-2). The effect of changing the culling rate is significant across all facility types, vaccination strategies, and most NAADSM outputs considered (for very small outbreaks, like the cow-calf p5 output (not shown), there is no effect of increasing or decreasing the culling rate). Specifically, increases in culling rate up to three-fold decrease the number of animals culled by more than a factor of five. Only doubling the culling rate has a modest effect on the largest outbreaks (the p95 outbreaks for both locations shown), but a significant effect on other outbreaks. Similarly, if the baseline culling rate cannot be achieved, the outbreak will involve more animals, by as much as three-fold. Figure 6.3.2-2: Effect of Changes to the Culling Rate on Number of Animals Culled in Kansas All axes are relative to the baseline culling rate (results that lie along y=1 have no effect on head culled compared to baseline). Each line represents either a unique combination of outbreak starting 510 Updated SSRA facility type, NAADSM output, or vaccination strategy (Vaccination strategy A was used unless otherwise noted). To ensure that increased culling rates reduced the impact of an FMD outbreak, regardless of the type of facility at which the outbreak begins, the culling rate was varied in outbreaks starting in all premises types (Figure 6.3.2-3). As demonstrated, increasing the culling rate over the baseline decreases the impact of the outbreak across all premises types used in the model, and across all plausible vaccination strategies. However, if the outbreak is very small (such as the median outbreak starting in a backyard facility), no benefit of increasing the culling rate is observed (not shown). Figure 6.3.2-3: Effect of Changes to Culling Rate on Head Culled in the Outbreak in Kansas Each line represents a different starting premises type, vaccination strategy (Vaccination Strategy A is used unless otherwise noted), or NAADSM output. BY-SS designates a small, backyard facility. The importance of culling rate holds even if the baseline contact rates are changed for every premises type in the model (Figure 6.3.2-4). This figure shows the median output for outbreaks that start in a feedlot across several culling rates, in the context of direct and indirect contact rates two-fold greater or lesser than the baseline. Note that the importance of culling rate still holds under the different contact rates. The somewhat reduced impact of increasing culling rate, in the context of indirect contact rates twice the baseline, is due to the fact that the outbreak approaches maximum size for these outbreaks. 511 Updated SSRA Figure 6.3.2-4: Effect of Changes to the Culling Rate on Number of Animals in the Context of Changed Direct and Indirect Contact Rates All axes are relative to the baseline culling rate (results that lie along y=1 have no effect on duration compared to baseline). Each line represents a set of contact rates that is half or twice the baseline for all premises types. This analysis suggests that any reduction in the culling rate from the baseline will significantly exacerbate an outbreak of FMD. For this reason, ensuring that states can field and sustain as many culling teams as currently estimated is critical. In the Updated SSRA, the estimates of the number of culling teams were taken from state stakeholders at face value. Further studies could investigate the resources that states have marshaled to train, exercise, and retain culling teams to evaluate their estimates for the number of teams that could be fielded (and for how long) and how federal resources would be used in a multi-state response. Equally critically, this analysis shows that modest increases in culling capacity (by three-fold) significantly ameliorate the outbreak. In the section below, the cost and feasibility of increasing culling capacity is explored. 512 Updated SSRA 6.3.2.2 Cost of Increasing Culling Rate This section explores the costs that would be required to increase destruction capacity in a single state. Both the training and physical resources needed to increase capacity must be considered. Based on multiple state interviews, states on average believe that they will be able to recruit 13 culling teams to support a sustained culling operation. The baseline culling rate is herd per day per captive bolt team (see Section 6.1.4.3). Therefore, the current culling capacity of a single average state is roughly four herds per day. Current destruction capacity in each state is supported by existing federal resources, including Destruction, Decontamination, Disposal (3D) teams and federal equipment resources. In order to increase destruction capacity, both the number of culling teams in each state and supporting resources supplied by the federal government must be increased. SMEs consulted to estimate these resources are provided in Appendix A6. Personnel Culling teams and 3D teams differ both in number of team members and their specialized training requirements. Culling teams are typically composed of 12 members. A single task force leader oversees a Destruction Crew, an Animal Handling Crew, and an Animal Removal Crew. The Destruction Crew includes a crew leader, two captive bolt shooters, one designated captive bolt loader, and a captive bolt service technician. Depending on the operation, the animal handling crew and the animal removal crew will each employ between one and six personnel [Hill, 2011]. The animal removal team is responsible for removing the animal from the area where animals are being destroyed, whereas a 3D team will handle disposal. The size of these crews is determined by the availability of existing facility personnel onsite to aid in animal movement and carcass removal; larger facilities and feedlots may have enough personnel on hand to eliminate the need for animal handling crews and animal removal crews entirely. Since most of the facilities in Kansas tend to be smaller, cow-calf operations, the assumption was made that a full team was needed. The cost to double the number of culling teams available to support destruction lies entirely in training, because all other costs (cost for deployment, for example) are realized only after the outbreak occurs. The costs to double capacity through online classes and in-person training are outlined in Table 6.3.2-1. Every member of a culling team must receive basic Incident Command System (ICS) structure training to become familiarized and effective within an ICS response. ICS training modules have already been developed by the government; these modules are offered free of charge and therefore would add no additional costs. All members must also receive training on biosecurity, which includes understanding the core concepts of biosanitation and practical training on appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Depending on the organization administering this biosecurity training, the cost per participant is expected to be several hundred dollars. Shooters, loaders, and service technicians additionally participate in one-day training on the captive bolt kit system. This practical training encompasses captive bolt operation, cleaning, and replacement of 513 Table 6.3.2 -1: Cost of Training 13 Culling Teams Training Component Required Members Cost per Mem ber Cost per Team Total Annual Costs ICS 100 Level Course 12 $0 $0 $0 Biosecurity Training 12 4 $300 -Specific Captive Bolt TOTAL - - $10,200 $133,000 Updated SSRA parts t hat wear. Shooters also undergo hands-on training to become effective at animal destruction using the captive bolt kit. This intensive, hands-on training is animal-specific and lasts one day per animal species. Although there are two shooters per team, it is recommended that a third person typically a loader also become proficient in destruction in order to serve as a backup and to prevent shooter fatigue. The cost figures below assume that shooters and loaders receive the full three-day course, which covers all three types of vulnerable animal species (cattle, swine, and small ruminants). This assumption was made in order to assure full deployment of teams regardless of scenario, and to provide for the most conservative cost estimates. In general, it is recommended (and potentially required due to member turnover) that training courses are re-administered for all teams each year. Therefore the analysis considered training courses as a necessary annual cost to maintain proficiency. The intensive three-day, animal-specific captive bolt training is an exception; re-certification only every three years is considered prudent. To standardize the animal-specific captive bolt training as an annual cost in the calculations, the cost for this training was treated as an average yearly cost (the cost was divided across three years). Note: Other training may be prudent or required by regulations in some areas, but is not considered in this anal ysis. This additional training could include first aid training for all members; higher level ICS courses for task force leaders or destruction team leaders; and, specialized captive bolt service training for service technicians that would allow on-site repair of broken captive bolt kits that cannot be fixed through simple replacement of parts that wear. 3D contractors (All-Hazards response companies with specialized training) support the depopulation efforts of culling teams in biosanitation and carcass disposal roles. Five All-Hazards companies are under contract with the federal government to act as 3D service providers during an outbreak and are maintained to support any state-level culling team. Additional All-Hazard response companies can become 3D-proficient through training events run by the equipment manufacturers. These training events are typically hosted at and paid for by the National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS), the agency that issues 3D contracts. A 3D training event builds upon standard competencies possessed by All-Hazards response companies; the 3D training event focuses on concepts specific to animal disease outbreaks, including various levels of PPE use. The All-Hazards companies bring their own PPE to this training event. 514 Table 6.3.2 -2: Cost of 3D Training for an Additional Five All -Hazards Response Companies Training component 3D \"Train the Trainer \" Course 3D Large Scale Exercise TOTAL Annual Co st $3,000 $20,000 $23,000 Updated SSRA The c ost for this one-day training event is $600 for two representatives from an All-Hazards response company; these representatives then train others on t ! training events discussed in this document, travel and per diem expenses are not included and may add costs. In addition to the 3D training course, NVS recommends an annual large scale exercise/demonstration for 3D contractors. This exercise provides hands-on depopulation experience with actual equipment and live animals. A single exercise is large enough for all existing 3D teams. As is the case with culling training, annual exercises and re-training are recommended and are therefore considered reoccurring costs (Table 6.3.2-2). Large scale exercises have historically been paid for by the NVS. Equipment Cull ing equipment is available as a federal resource through the NVS. In this study, the assumption is made that the current level of federal equipment resources supports the current culling capacity across the country. Since these resources are shared among all states, it is assumed that increased culling capacity in a single state will require a proportional increase in supporting federal resources. NVS culling equipment components can be categorized as either animal handling equipment or animal destruction equipment. Animal handling equipment includes livestock panels, squeeze-shoots, and other mobile equipment used to corral and direct animal movement to enable efficient culling. While some facilities such as feedlots will already have appropriate animal handling equipment onsite, other facilities such as small cow-calf facilities, which represent most of the premises in the modeled region, will have little or no animal handling equipment. Therefore, it is assumed that all teams require a set of animal handling equipment. There are both one-time costs and annual costs associated with animal handling equipment: one-time procurement cost is a combination of purchase and delivery costs (estimated at $600,000), whereas annual costs cover storage and routine equipment maintenance (estimated at $60,000 per year). Animal destruction during an eradication campaign may be carried out by teams using captive bolt kits, teams operating mobile electrocution units, or both. Currently captive bolt kits are used whenever necessary and on all facility types. However, in the future, captive bolt use may be largely relegated to small operations and used as a secondary option for medium operations. Mobile electrocution units are considered most efficient for larger operations. 515 Updated SSRA For our analysis, we calculated costs for two strategies: a captive bolt only strategy, and a mixed captive bolt/electrocution unit strategy. In the captive bolt strategy, all increased culling capacity is achieved through an increased number of captive bolt kits (Table 6.3.2-3). In the mixed strategy, half of all increased culling capacity is achieved through acquisition of mobile electrocution units, and the other half is achieved with captive bolt kits (Table 6.3.2-4). Note: No cost data are currently available for mobile electrocution unit training courses. Therefore in the final cost calculation it was assumed that the cost to train a team in the use of the mobile electrocution unit is equal to the cost to train a team in the use of captive bolt kits. Also, no mobile electrocution units currently exist in the NVS stockpile. Table 6.3.2 -3: Cost of Culling Equipment Procurement for the Captive Bolt S trategy Animal Destruction Equipment One -time Cost Captive bolt kits $400,000 $400,000 TOTAL Table 6.3.2 -4: Cost of Culling Equipment Procurement for the Mixed Bolt/Electrocution Strategy in which Half of New Culling Capacity is Provided by Mobile E lectrocution Units Animal Destruction Equipment One -time Cost Captive Bolt Kits $200,000 $2,000,000 Mobile Electrocution Units TOTAL $2,200,000 Total Cost Calculations Recall that, to increase the culling rate in Kansas, the state-specific resources (culling teams) must be increased and the federal resources to support culling in any state must be increased. Using this basis, a total five-year cost was calculated for each strategy by adding equipment procurement cost to the total annual costs across a five year period (Table 6.3.2-5). 516 Table 6.3.2 -5: Total Cost to Double Culling Capacity in a Single State for Captive Bolt and Mixed Bolt/Electrocution Strategies Culling Strategy Annual Costs One -time Cost Total 5 Training Equipment Equipment Year Cost 3D Teams Culling Teams storage All captive culling capacity to levels beyond double current capacity, it was assumed that costs would scale linearly (Table 6.3.2-6). Table 6.3.2 -6: Total Costs to Increase Culling Capacity to Various Levels According to the Captive Bolt and Mixed Bolt/Electrocution Strategies Culling Strategy Total 5-Year Cost All Captive $33,075,000 This analysis shows that achieving the desired, three-fold increase in culling capacity can be done for a relatively modest cost ($4 to $8 million) and may significantly reduce the extent of an outbreak. Note that although implementation of mobile electrocution units is far more expensive in this analysis, it is an artifact because the analysis does not consider the real-world difficulties of culling extremely large premises by captive bolt systems alone. 6.3.3 Effect of Contact Restrictions after Outbreak Detection In this section, the effect of changes to the parameters that describe how livestock premises contact one another after an infection is discovered is discussed. After an infection is discovered, indirect and direct contact with infected premises decrease. Sensitivity to changes in these parameters is explored in two ways: by changing the amount by which contact is reduced and by changing the time needed to reach the minimum contract rate. Both types of changes illuminate how uncertainty in the parameterization of control measures effect the baseline results, and simultaneously describe how additional measures to support contact restrictions could mitigate the outbreak. This sensitivity analysis is critical because the 517 Updated SSRA data underlying the degree to which contact will be curtailed during a real outbreak is sparse. Moreover, it is difficult to determine to what extent preparedness efforts can change behaviors and then reflect these in a model. For example, training producers on biosanitary guidelines may reduce the spread of a disease by limiting direct and indirect contact, but by how much this training reduces the spread of the disease is unknown. For this reason, this section should be understood primarily as a sensitivity analysis that also may begin to inform some investment decisions regarding means to reduce contact after an outbreak, but not as a strict cost-benefit analysis. 6.3.3.1 Changing Minimum Direct Contact Rate The Updated SSRA team explored changes in the degree to which direct contacts can be reduced after an outbreak is announced by up to a factor of eight lower (from the baseline of 20% of pre-event contacts to 2.5%), and compared results in terms of duration, head culled, and head vaccinated to the baseline values. Although the degree to which direct contacts are reduced can have a significant effect on the results, the significance only holds for certain starting locations, vaccination strategies, and NAADSM outputs. Figure 6.3.3-1 shows the results for two representative starting locations and two NAADSM outputs (and the same vaccination strategy). Reducing the minimum direct contact rate significantly reduces the impact of the outbreak if the outbreak is relatively small (median or lesser) outbreaks in cow-calf operations and only the smallest outbreaks starting in feedlots (p5)). In contrast, if the outbreak is large, changing the minimum direct contact rate has little effect (median or larger) outbreaks in feedlots and only the largest outbreaks starting in cow-calf operations (p95)). This result reflects the phenomenon discussed in the introduction to the cost-benefit section. When an outbreak approaches the maximum size, a drop in the direct contact rate often does not reduce the size of an outbreak significantly (it is still reaching the maximum, even though it is less likely to reach the maximum for any iteration). However, when an outbreak is not reaching the maximum size, any drop in contact rates can further reduce the impact of the outbreak. 518 Updated SSRA Figure 6.3.3-1: Effect of Reducing the Minimum Direct Contact Rate After an Outbreak on Head Culled for Two Example Model Runs (One Starting in a Cow-Calf Operation and One in a Feedlot) for Two NAADSM Outputs Note the larger outbreaks are not sensitive to changes in the minimum direct contact rate. 6.3.3.2 Changing Minimum Indirect Contact Rate The Updated SSRA team explored changes in the degree to which indirect contacts can be reduced after an outbreak is announced by up to a factor of eight lower (from the baseline of 40% of pre-event contacts to 5%), and compared results in terms of duration, head culled, and head vaccinated to the baseline values. Decreases in the minimum indirect contact rate significantly reduce the outbreak size and duration for all premises types, vaccination strategies, and NAADSM outputs examined (Figure 6.3.3-2). When considering head culled, large outbreaks (like the 95 percentile feedlot output) are also ameliorated by decreases of the minimum indirect contact rate, but larger decreases in the contact rat e are needed to see the same impact. This result underscores the importance of the education of producers and the service providers that support them in biosanitary standards, both before and after an outbreak is declared. Clearly, stricter adherence to these standards would not only affect contact rate, but also provide other benefits in disease control, such as reducing the degree to which a disease can spread within a herd. Also, because outbreaks of the size modeled are beyond the ability of state 519 Updated SSRA emergency managers to directly control with zones, this result underscores the importance of public communication strategies to rapidly inform the public, producers, and all other livestock handlers about the importance of eliminating contact with potentially infected animals. Figure 6.3.3-2: Effect of Reducing the Minimum Indirect Contact Rate After an Outbreak for Two Premises Types, NAADSM Outputs, and Vaccination Strategies The left panel shows the change in duration; the right panel shows the change in head culled. 6.3.3.3 Changing the Time Needed to Reduce Direct Contacts In addition to changing the degree to which direct contacts can be limited after an outbreak is discovered, the time needed to reduce contacts to a minimum can also be altered. The Updated SSRA team explored changes in the time to reduce direct contacts by up to a factor of eight (both greater and lesser) and compared the results in terms of duration, head culled, and head vaccinated to the baseline values. Although the time to reduce direct contacts can have a significant effect on the results, the significance only holds for certain starting locations, vaccination strategies, and NAADSM outputs. Figure 6.3.3-3 shows the results for two representative starting locations (and the same vaccination strategy and NAADSM output). As demonstrated, for outbreaks that start in a cow-calf operation under these conditions, reducing the time to a minimum direct contact rate decreased the head culled by up to a factor of two; however, decreasing that time for outbreaks that start in feedlots had no effect. This result reflects the phenomenon discussed in the introduction to this section. When an outbreak approaches the maximum size, a drop in contacts often does not reduce the size of the outbreak significantly (it is still reaching the maximum, even though it is less likely to reach the maximum for any iteration). However, when an outbreak is not reaching the maximum size, any drop in contact rates can further reduce the impact of the outbreak. 520 Updated SSRA Figure 6.3.3-3: Effect of Changes of the Time to Reduce Direct Contact Rates on Head Culled for Two Example Model Runs (One Starting in a Cow-Calf Operation and One in a Feedlot) The feedlot represents a model run insensitive to changes in the time to reduce direct contact rates, and the cow-calf operation represents a model run sensitive to changes in the time to reduce direct contact rates. 6.3.3.4 Changing the Time Needed to Reduce Indirect Contacts Similarly, the time to minimum indirect contact rates can be altered. The Updated SSRA team explored changes in the time to minimum indirect contact rates by up to a factor of eight (greater and lesser) and compared the results in terms of duration, head culled, and head vaccinated to the baseline values. Increasing the time to minimum indirect contact rates can increase the impact of an outbreak by up to a factor of ten, and decreasing the time to minimum indirect contact rates can decrease the impact by up to a factor of five. However, this effect is seen only for certain starting locations, NAADSM outputs, and vaccination strategies (Figure 6.3.3-4.). In general, the effect of changing the time to minimum indirect contact rates has a significant effect on the outcome of the smaller outbreaks (the p5 NAADSM outputs for several starting conditions and the p50 NAADSM output for cow-calf facilities) and not on the impact of larger outbreaks (the p50 and p95 NAADSM output for feedlots and the p95 outputs for cow-calf operations). 521 Updated SSRA Figure 6.3.3-4: Effect of Changes to the Time to Reduce Indirect Contact Rates on Head Culled for Six Example Model Runs (Three Starting in a Cow-Calf Operation and Three in a Feedlot) Note how the larger outbreaks (the median and 95 feedlot start and the p95 cow-calf start) are insensitive to changes in the time to reduce indirect contacts, whereas a significant benefit can be seen in smaller outbreaks. This effect is probably due to the large outbreaks reaching their maximum size. 6.3.3.5 Cost of Improving Movement Restrictions As discussed, ascribing a particular modeling value for movement restrictions to real-world mitigation strategies is difficult. For example, what reduction in indirect contact rates would be afforded by a comprehensive biosanitary education campaign targeted at hoof trimmers? How much will a producer- targeted education campaign focused on the dangers of FMD reduce direct contacts after an outbreak is discovered? In this section, some good practices will be described that may reduce indirect and direct contacts after an outbreak. These strategies may be considered for adoption despite the fact that none of these strategies can be linked quantitatively to a demonstrated benefit in terms of a less severe outbreak. 522 Table 6.3.3 -1: Costs to Purchase Emergency Radios to Improve Communication of Animal Movement Requirements Radius Around NBAF Farms Radio Costs 10 Kilom eters 62 $3,000 20 Kilometers 227 $11,000 Kilometers 1629 $80,000 7356 $370,000 Updated SSRA There are two important factors in animal movement control at the local level: 1) notifying producers of an FMD outbreak and of associated animal movement requirements, which could continually evolve during an outbreak; and, 2) establishing traffic control measures that control shipments already en- route at the time of an outbreak declaration, and that later ensure ongoing adherence to changing animal movement requirements. Training of local responders in animal disease response is crucial and is addressed below, as well. Producer Notification Producer and citizen awareness programs have already been employed for a number of years in areas Creek Generating Station. The Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation conducts various activities in E ! E E Program. These activities include multi-agency exercises, producer awareness sessions, and literature distribution (including glove box manuals, calendars, and telephone book inserts containing emergency E develop a program similar to the REP Program for facilities like the NBAF, to provide information useful in the control of an outbreak of disease. In the context of an accident at the NBAF, a positive test result for FMD in a state is expected to immediately trigger a stop movement order lasting 24 to 72 hours for all animals within that state. Once an outbreak becomes public, word will spread through news media and social media outlets. However, local radio communication could be utilized to more rapidly reach producers. One strategy employed by the Wolf Creek Generating Station for local communication is the distribution of emergency radios (powered by AC and battery backup) to producers that would activate automatically during emergencies. The estimated costs to purchase emergency radios for producers in areas around the NBAF are shown in Table 6.3.3-1. Given that the news that an FMD outbreak is occurring will rapidly hit local and national media, the radios will possibly provide only a few hours of warning at best and may help marginally to reach producers who do not regularly follow news broadcasts. Given this limited audience, the benefit of distributing radios may be small. Other suggestions for improved producer notification are the development of local producer email lists fo r initial outbreak announcement and creation of a central information dissemination website for status updates. 523 Updated SSRA Traffic Control A variety of traffic control measures in different geographic locations will be employed to safely control and direct traffic immediately following an outbreak. The measures are needed to ensure that traffic unrelated to the shipment of animals can continue safely from areas in which the disease is identified, to facilitate the trade of livestock between unaffected areas, and also to ensure that illicit traffic in animals is not occurring from infected areas. Additionally, traffic control can limit the risk of the spread of disease on vehicles unrelated to the trade in animals. Some roads will become completely barricaded, while others will have checkpoints and cleaning and disinfection stations to safely allow vehicle passage. Although tabletop exercises have been carried out in order to explore movement control strategies, no quantitative data are currently available on the expected time needed by emergency planners to convene, identify optimal traffic control points, and execute an emergency traffic control plan. This timeframe could vary greatly based on the emergency response experience of local officials and unique challenges of the local infrastructure and terrain. Exact implementation of an emergency traffic control plan will depend on the circumstances specific to the outbreak. Experts suggest that local and regional traffic control planning would significantly improve the effectiveness and execution speed of emergency traffic control during an emergency. Proactive development of several situation-specific logistical plans would simplify and streamline the decision making process. Pre-event identification of suitable traffic control points could be achieved during county emergency planning sessions. In addition to traffic control points, in some areas it may be particularly challenging to identify areas large enough to temporarily hold large vehicles for disinfection (such as county fairgrounds or highway construction staging areas); ideally these areas would have access to water as well. Once county-level plans have been developed for areas around the NBAF, regional planning could synthesize and further optimize traffic control plans for the region according to the most likely outbreak scenarios; route control prioritization will likely follow recent logistical research [Graham et al., 2008]. The costs to perform such regional planning studies were not determined in this study. A potential extension of pre-event control point identification would be pre-event distribution of necessary traffic control equipment. Purchase and placement of dedicated barriers, signs, and other traffic control equipment in close proximity to control points would reduce the time and demand on heavy machinery and crews needed for traffic control point setup, enabling more effective movement control during an emergency (particularly if multiple infected premises are involved). A thorough examination of equipment needs would decrease local dependence on outside resources, which take longer to arrive than local resources, and could be limiting. For example, jersey barriers could be permanently positioned just off the roadside of locations expected to be used for road closure. Additionally, portable and permanent electronic signs could be positioned to either reduce traffic entering hot zones, or redistribute the traffic burden of heavily trafficked checkpoints. Concrete jersey barriers dedicated to appropriate control points could be purchased at an estimated cost of $500 to $1,000 each. Programmable electronic traffic signs cost roughly $15,000 each. 524 Updated SSRA Traffic control will also be important once initial movement restrictions are loosened; after initial stop movement, reestablishment of commerce will become a high priority. However, in many ways monitored, selective animal movement is more difficult to achieve than total stop movement. Checkpoint staffing, interstate permitting, and emergency activities coordination will be central once animal movement resumes in order to identify animal shipments that should be allowed to move. One important finding from the 2009 Animal Stop Movement Order Functional and Full-Scale Exercise involving Kansas and Oklahoma was that typical Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs) are not outfitted with sufficient dedicated communication equipment to effectively achieve communication goals [SES, 2009]. An effective, interoperable communication infrastructure will be crucial for the exchange of information between EOCs, traffic control checkpoints, law enforcement, and health authorities. States could advance this capability through acquisition of satellite phones, creation of state-wide radio systems (preferably interoperable between adjacent states), and mobile cell phone towers that can be installed in control zones. Kansas is currently developing one such 800 MHz statewide radio system. Local Responder Animal Disease Response Training Animal emergency response training is important for personnel involved in all aspects of outbreak response; however, this training may be particularly pertinent to strengthening movement control capabilities. While the investigation of infected premises will be carried out largely by epidemiologists trained in contagious disease, and depopulated animals ultimately will be disposed of by teams that have received certification in biosecurity through the NVS, local responders typically lack animal-specific emergency training. SMEs have cautioned that conventional first responder training is contrary to animal disease response training in critical aspects and may lead to actions that actually worsen an outbreak. The current availability of county-level animal disease response training programs is inadequate to prepare a sufficient number of first responders. Once an outbreak has been detected, it is expected that local responders will bear the burden of movement control and coordination activities, especially if the control area is large (multiple premises become infected) [Graham et al., 2008]. Personnel needs estimates for first responders during an FMD outbreak have ranged from hundreds to thousands, underlining the importance of the availability of animal disease response training. One of the most highly praised disease response training programs arising from government grants in recent years was the Animal Disease Response Training program at Kirkwood Community College. Arguably the most influential course that evolved from this program was course AWR-206. This course was offered as both an eight-hour standalone course and a 16-hour course with a train-the-trainer component. AWR-206 covered biosecurity concepts, PPE instruction, and livestock disease response considerations, with a focus on integration of federal, state, and local responsibilities. Cost and reac h information about AWR-206 is shown in Table 6.3.3-2. Although 1,400 students directly participated in the program, program analysts estimate that roughly tenfold more first responders were indirectly trained due to the success of the train-the-trainer aspect of the program. Development of the program 525 - Tab le 6.3.3-2: Cost and Reach of An imal Disea se Respo nse Training Co urse AWR-206 Developed b y Kirk wood Commu Fiscal Year 2010-2011 DHS of Courses Taught Number of Students Number of Student Hours Direct Costs Indirect Costs Total Cost Cost per Student Hour Cost per Student Trained AWR 206 60 1,400 23,000 $930,000 $130,000 $1,060,000 $46 SSRA was associated with additional costs; however, re-implementation of this program would have few upfront costs as the program curriculum, course materials, and training staff are largely intact. The largest government contracts to develop and deliver animal disease response training programs have either recently expired or will expire soon. 6.3.4 Observation and Reporting The initial detection and reporting of an outbreak of FMD has several components. First, a producer or federal veterinarian. His/her veterinarian will contact a state or federal veterinarian who will dispatch a specially trained foreign animal disease diagnostician to collect samples. The samples will be sent to the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and may be shared also with the nearest National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratory for testing. The probability of observation is based on the frequency that a producer observes his animals (which is a daily occurrence in a feedlot but somewhat rare for animals on pasture), the percent of his herd that he observes, and the chance that a sick animal is recognized. In this section, the effect of changing the parameters related to observation and reporting is explored one component at a time. In the section that follows, other possible systems (that do not involve the producer) for surveillance and detection of FMD are described and explored. 6.3.4.1 Changing the Probability that a Sick Animal Would be Observed Once sick animals begin to show signs of sickness, it is possible that a producer will observe those signs. In the model used in the Updated SSRA, the probability to observe a sick animal and notice that it is sick is a function of the production type (which determines how often a producer sees his animals and what D extraordinary. In this analysis, the effect of changing the observation function was studied to determine how sensitive model outputs are to this function, and to understand the possible benefit of education campaigns that enable producers to better recognize the signs of FMD, or incentivize them to observe a larger portion of their herds more frequently. In Figure 6.3.4- 1, the probability that a producer can observe and recognize the signs of FMD is increased and decreased by up to four-fold. Note that changing the probability of observation has a significant effect on outbreaks that have not reached their maximum size (cow-calf p50 and feedlot p5) but only a minor effect on outbreaks that are very large (cow-calf p95 and feedlot p50). 526 Updated SSRA Figure 6.3.4-1: Effect of Changing the Observation Probability for Two Premises Types and NAADSM Outputs The left panel shows the change in duration, the right panel shows the change in head culled. 6.3.4.2 Improving the Probability that a Sick Animal is Reported to a Veterinarian Once a sick animal is observed, a producer may ignore the signs, may try to treat the animal himself (or kill the animal), or may report the illness to a veterinarian. The probability that a producer would call a veterinarian immediately is different for each premises type as determined by interviews conducted by the Updated SSRA team (20% of cow-calf operators would call a veterinarian immediately, whereas a third of feedlot operators would call a veterinarian immediately). Several measures could increase the probability that a producer would call a veterinarian quickly. An education campaign that focused on the signs and potential impact of FMD would decrease the chance that a producer would attempt to treat FMD himself. Similarly, educating more producers that free veterinarian visits are provided if FMD is suspected may improve the chance that a veterinarian would be called for some production types (like small ruminant facilities, in which the value of the animal is less than the cost of a visit by a veterinarian). In Figure 6.3.4-2, below, the benefit of increasing the probability that a veterinarian is called percent of producers who do not call a veterinarian immediately now do (for example, if only 30% of feedlot owners would normally call a veterinarian immediately, 30% of owners would NOT call a veterinarian in the majority system). Note that increasing the probability that a veterinarian is called quickly drops the consequences of an outbreak for all but the largest outbreaks. For large outbreaks, the probability that an outbreak would reach maximum size is reduced (not shown). 527 Updated SSRA Figure 6.3.4-2: The Effect of Improving the Probability that a Producer Calls a Veterinarian Soon After Observing Signs of FMD Relative to the Baseline Probability H ( ) M ty of producers immediately call a veterinarian (the percent is specific to the production type). In a majority system, if 30% of producers would call a veterinarian immediately in the baseline, 30% would NOT call a veterinarian immediately (70% would call immediately). 6.3.4.3 Air Samplers, Sentinel Animals, and Active Surveillance The studies above explored the benefit of educating producers on the importance of observing their animals frequently and reporting suspicious signs to a veterinarian as soon as possible. However, other systems could be deployed that do not involve participation by producers. In the results section, the benefit of detecting a release of FMD before the first animal falls ill was shown to be significant (compare events that release 108 PFU of FMDv surreptitiously, versus a self-announcing event like an earthquake). The NBAF could hire animal disease diagnosticians to visit susceptible herds regularly and perform diagnostic tests or look for suspicious signs. These veterinarians would need to physically travel to farms each day in order to visually examine animals for symptoms of FMD or to take samples. Ideally this approach would decrease the delay between animal infection and detection of FMD. 528 Updated SSRA SMEs caution that producers may resist routine inspection and be alarmed by constant surveillance. To improve producer acceptance of the strategy, it has been suggested that producers could be incentivized with free routine veterinary services from these personnel. Even with incentives, it might be necessary to make inspection mandatory in order to achieve 100% compliance among producers. This strategy also raises concerns about biosecurity. Although more farm visits by animal health professionals may increase the likelihood of recognizing an FMD outbreak early, it also introduces the risk that a veterinarian will inadvertently spread FMDv from an infected farm to an unexposed farm. This risk increases significantly as the number of farms that each veterinarian visits each day increases; considering the large number of farms in the areas surrounding the NBAF, each veterinarian would have to visit multiple farms each day to make this strategy feasible. Moreover, it is unlikely that a veterinarian who is visiting a herd for a limited time would observe the few animals that may actually be showing signs of disease within a large herd. Pooled veterinary samples could increase the number of animals effectively screened by surveillance, but the reach will still not be total. Ultimately, concerns about producer acceptance and cross-contamination are likely to eliminate routine inspection from consideration as a surveillance strategy. Air samplers could be used for extremely early detection of outbreaks caused by aerosol releases from the NBAF (such as an event caused by the total failure of the HEPA filtration system). Even though laboratory experiments have demonstrated the collection and detection of FMDv from the air, no system currently exists for the constant surveillance of air samples for FMDv. To explore the possible benefit of developing and deploying a system that could detect airborne FMDv, the largest surreptitious aerosol release was modeled (lack of HEPA filtration in the animal room - Event AA10) and across all meteorological conditions, the dose received at any point near the NBAF was determined. Four locations (at the compass points in the areas of highest time-integrated concentration of FMDv) were selected as possible locations for the placement of an air sampler. Then, the dose these air samplers would receive across all meteorological conditions was calculated assuming that they can entrain 100 liters per minute (L/min) or 1,000 L/min of air. For the purposes of this analysis, it was assumed that the air samplers would capture all virus particles presented to it at this entrainment rate, and that all virus particles could be recovered from the samples and used in a diagnostic assay (in the normal operation of similar systems, some of the sample is not recoverable from the capture matrix and only some of the sample is used in each assay). As mentioned in the results, more than 90% of these releases related to Event AA10 cause an infection in at least one premises, so this event would be a high priority for an air sampling system to detect. However, the four-sampler system, even if it is assumed that the assay used on the air samples can detect as little as 1 PFU, performs poorly (Table 6.3.4-1). Only if perfect capture and recovery of a sample and an assay limit of detection of 1 PFU are assumed, does the chance of detection of aerosol releases approach 10%. Given that air samplers and detection assays do not yet exist with these performance characteristics, and the locations of the air samplers were chosen based on the high concentration of FMDv at those locations, the deployment of an air sampler system is likely to not be beneficial. This conclusion is undergirded by the fact that this aerosol release event contributes only a 529 Updated SSRA little to the risk space, and that the cost of false positives from an air sampling system have not been considered. Table 6.3.4 -1: The Probability of Detection of an Aerosol Release that Causes a Downwind Infection as a Function of Entrainment Rate of an Air Sampler and the Limit of Detection of the Assay Used on the Air Sample Entrainment Rate Percent of releases that cause at Percent of releases that cause at least one infection detected least one infection detected assuming a 1 PFU limit of assuming a 10 PFU limit of detection detection 100 liters/min 1% 0% 1,000 liters/min 9% 1% The poor performance of an air sampling system could be predicted by the nature of an FMD outbreak caused by an aerosol. The downwind infections are caused by a very dilute aerosol of a pathogen with a very small median infectious dose covering an area that contains many hundred susceptible animals and, importantly, the infection of just one animal is enough to cause the outbreak. For a network of air samplers to detect an aerosol that may cause an infection, it must entrain about the same amount of air as all the animals exposed to the aerosol combined, and the assay used on the air sample must be able to detect as little as one median infectious dose (less than 10 PFU in many cases). These requirements are beyond the capabilities of technology available today and the immediate future. For similar reasons, sentinel animals would be of limited value. The aerosols released from the NBAF are dilute and therefore unlikely to infect a single animal placed in any location outside the NBAF. Instead, infections occur downwind because many hundred animals are exposed to dilute aerosols. Of course, one could completely surround the NBAF with a herd of several hundred cattle and take blood samples from the cattle daily but this concept stretches the notion of a sentinel herd. Moreover, the presence of a large herd of cattle on the grounds of the NBAF outside of containment may itself exacerbate the risk of an infection leaving the NBAF. Because no system involving active surveillance, air samplers, or sentinel animals is feasible, acceptable to producers, and/or effective, the costs of these systems is not described below. 6.3.4.4 Cost of Improving Surveillance and Detection The time delay between premises infection and FMD identification may greatly affect the duration and extent of an outbreak. Improved disease surveillance could reduce this delay. Producer awareness is paramount to FMD identification, particularly for the index case, as producers are typically the only ones who interact with their animals on a routine basis. Producer awareness training sessions (roughly 90 minutes long) serve as a review of local emergency !D ! likely to notice disease symptoms in their animals, the first and most obvious symptoms of FMD are 530 Updated SSRA similar to those observed for several other diseases (fever, general depression, reduced interest in feed y to distinguish between FMD and more benign illnesses that producers can safely treat; importantly, emphasis is also placed on encouraging producers to report suspicious conditions quickly. Estimated costs to conduct producer awareness sessions in counties across various areas around the NBAF are shown in Table 6.3.4-2. The costs for producer sessions cover trainer salaries, room rental, meals for attending producers, and materials including handouts, but do not include costs to cover travel to the training session or reimburse producers for their time. When similar courses were offered in the past few years, typically 50 producers from each county participated. The number of producers captured for the cost in the table below, therefore, is simply 50 for each county. If even part of a county was captured by a radius around the NBAF, it was counted in this analysis even if the majority of the county was outside the radius. Table 6.3.4 -2: Cos ts to Conduct Producer Awareness Sessions Across Various Areas A round the NBAF Radius Around NBAF Counties Producers Cost 10 Kilometers 2 100 4 200 13 650 29 1,450 105 5,250 $8,000 $16,000 $52,000 $116,000 $420,000 20 Kilometers 50 Kilometers 100 Kilometers All of Kansas Even though it was conservatively assumed that only 50 producers per county would be reached by each session, feedback from sessions has indicated that follow-up sessions in subsequent years would attract greater numbers of producers through word of mouth. Also, while 50 producers show up in person, attendees historically have taken home multiple copies of educational materials from the session and distributed them to neighbors. At the producer awareness sessions, producers are given a laminated quick-reference sheet to keep in their house or barn which lists a short, bulleted list of reportable conditions that should prompt a call to t contacts including web addresses and phone numbers for local and state veterinarians. Producer awareness session costs (Table 6.3.4-2) include the cost of the laminated handouts, but an alternative to conducting training in every county would be distribution of these reference sheets through mail without in-person interaction. The cost to mail these sheets to every farm within various areas around the NBAF are shown in Table 6.3.4- 3. 531 Table 6.3.4 -3: Costs to Print and Mail Laminated Agricultural Emergency Quick -Reference Sheets to Producers Within Various Areas Around the NBAF Radius Around NBAF Farms Handout Cost Handout + Postage Cost 10 Kilometers 62 $50 $75 20 Kilometers 227 $200 $300 Costs to Place Emergency Reference Gatefold Inserts in Yellow Page Phone Books Serving Various Regions Around the NBAF Radius Around NBAF Counties Included Phone Book Reg ions Annual Cost 10 Kilometers 2 2 $31,000 20 Kilometers 4 4 $62,000 50 Kilometers 13 6 $94,000 100 Kilometers 29 13 $203,000 All of Kansas 105 40 $624,000 Updated SSRA One example of an emergency reference distribution strategy is a telephone book advertisement; this strate g y has been employed by the Wolf Creek Generating Station in the past to ensure that basic emergency plan details and contact numbers are avail served through 40 different Yellow Pages telephone book regions. Based on recent price quotes, the estimated annual costs to place fold- phone books serving various areas around the NBAF are shown in Table 6.3.4- 4. Although producer awareness training can take place in the absence of a county emergency plan, SMEs adv ise that establishing and reviewing county plans encourages producer familiarization with important contacts and significantly increases effectiveness of awareness training. A county emergency planning session typically precedes a producer awareness session. In a county emergency planning session, 15 to 25 county stakeholders participate in an all-day process to develop a written plan for agricultural emergencies. Participants typically include emergency management coordinators, law enforcement, first responders, and local veterinarians. The goal of the planning session is to identify important contacts and to outline roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, including producer expectations. Estimated costs to conduct emergency planning sessions in counties across various areas around the NBAF are shown in Table 6.3.4-5. These costs cover trainer salaries, room rental, and materials, but do not cover the salaries of attendees or travel costs. 532 Table 6.3.4 -5: Costs to Conduct County -Level Emergency Planning Sessions Across Various Areas Around the NBAF Radius Around NBAF Counties Included Cost 10 Kilometers 2 $7,000 20 Kilometers 4 $14,000 50 Kilometers 13 $46,000 100 Kilometers 29 $102,000 All of Kansas 105 $368,000 Table 6.3.4 -6: Costs to Cond uct Both County Planning and Producer Awareness Sessions Across Various Areas Around the NBAF Radius Around NBAF Counties Included Producers Included Cost 10 Kilometers 2 100 $15,000 20 Kilometers 4 200 $30,000 50 Kilometers 13 650 $100,000 100 Kilome ters 29 $220,000 All of Kansas 105 5250 $790,000 Updated SSRA Combined costs for county planning sessions and producer awareness sessions across various areas arou nd the NBAF are shown in Table 6.3.4-6. As above, we assumed that 50 producers would attend the session per county based on historical rates. When considering the potential benefit of these measures, it is important to understand where an ou tbreak is likely to strike first. That is, the awareness campaigns should include the vast majority o f possible locations that could be the site of the first infection. For most waste scenarios (except for the release event that occurs at the landfill) and all but the most catastrophic aerosol release scenarios, almost all locations affected are within 10 kilometers of the NBAF. For the transference release events, however, the initial infection can occur quite far from the NBAF. In Table 6.3.4-7, the percentage of starting locations in the transference events and their distance from the NBAF is shown. This analysis demonstrates that although an education campaign that includes only producers within 100 kilometers of the NBAF is less than half the cost of a campaign that covers all of Kansas, it is likely to miss up to a quarter of the possible starting locations due to transference events. If transference events are considered to be the main driver of risk, this shortcoming is not worth the cost savings afforded. Table 6.3.4 -7: Percentage of Initial Infections Caused by Transference Events as a Function o f Distance From the NBAF Radius Around NBAF % of Transference Starts SSRA 6.3.5 Conclusions These results demonstrate that investments to achieve the predicted culling capacity are critical for FMD outbreak mitigation, and that further investments to improve culling capacity would be beneficial no matter how large the outbreak is or where it begins. Investments that reduce the amount of direct and indirect contact between infected and susceptible farms after an outbreak are also beneficial in reducing the extent of outbreaks, and also reducing the probability that an outbreak would become very large. Despite the fact that early detection of an outbreak can greatly mitigate its effects, air samplers, sentinel herds, and active surveillance are of limited value because these systems are unlikely to signal that an outbreak has (or will) occur given the releases modeled from the NBAF. However, producer education campaigns that incentivize producers to observe their animals for suspicious signs, enable them to recognize the signs of FMD as suspicious, and encourage them to call a veterinarian when the signs are first observed, could significantly reduce the impact of an outbreak. Given that an outbreak due to transference events could happen anywhere in Kansas, it is unwise to focus any informational system on just the region around the NBAF. 6.3.6 Other Sensitivity Analysis In this section, we explore how the change of parameters that are not applicable to improved outbreak detection or control measures affects the analysis. This analysis informs how much confidence can be placed in the results as absolute reflections of the impact of an FMD outbreak given that some of the modeling parameters are based on scanty evidence. As discussed, epidemiological models are best used to understand relative risk and relative benefit of risk mitigation measures because inaccuracies in a model are reflected in the baseline and experimental cases, largely cancelling each other out. 6.3.6.1 Effect of Aerosol Dose Threshold In the Updated SSRA, a livestock premises was considered to be the possible starting place for a location if the dose received by the animals in that premises passed a particular threshold. This threshold is not a static value, but a function of the number of animals in the premises and the animal type (which dictates the dose due to the species-specific minute-tidal volumes and the specific dose-response curve used). However, the experimental dose-response data that supports the dose-response curve are generated by doses far above the dose typically received by animals in this study, so there is significant uncertainty related to the appropriateness of these dose-response thresholds. As described in the methods section, the baseline threshold uses the probability that at least one animal in a cattle or small ruminant facility inhales at least 1 PFU (the swine threshold is based on probit analysis because the doses that have a nonzero probability of infection are greater than 1 PFU). In this section, the effect of the threshold being a factor of two greater or lesser than this amount (the probability that at least one animal inhales at least 0.5 PFU to 2 PFU) is explored. Also, the use of a threshold based on at least one animal inhaling a aerosols of FMDv. 534 Updated SSRA For small aerosol releases, there is a very small effect of lowering the infection threshold (Figure 6.3.6\u00ad 1). For a release outside of containment (left panel), the probability of getting at least one infection from the release increases from 0.4% to 1.2%. For a release in containment when HEPA filtration is not functioning, the probability of getting at least one infection increases from 0.1% to 0.4%. The maximum number of premises simultaneously infected in both cases increases from one to two. If the threshold were lower (based on the minimum infectious dose, for example), no infections would occur from a release of this size under any meteorological condition. Figure 6.3.6-1: Effect of Changing the Aerosol Infection Threshold on the Number of Premises Initially Infected for a Release Outside of Containment (left) and a Release in Containment where HEPA Filtration is Not Operating (right) The y-axis shows the percentile of meteorological conditions in which that number of premises (or fewer) are infected. The red line is the baseline threshold, the orange line shows a 2x lower threshold. The blue line that runs across the top of the graph (no infections under any meteorological condition) uses a threshold based on the minimum infectious dose for each animal. For larger aerosol releases (such as the complete failure of the HEPA system in the BSL3 animal room), the decrease of the infection threshold also has a very small effect (Figure 6.3.6-2). Decreasing the baseline threshold by a factor of two increases the probability that an infection would occur in at least one premises from roughly 95% to 98%. For meteorological conditions that lead to the infection of multiple premises, the lower threshold increases the number of premises initially infected by about 50%. As shown in the results section, there is a correlation between the impact of the outbreak and the number of premises initially infected. However, an outbreak starting in a single important location (like a large feedlot) can have the same impact as an outbreak simultaneously starting in 10 smaller locations. Increasing the infection threshold by using the minimum infectious dose decreases the probability of at least one premises becoming infected from 95% at the baseline to roughly 60%. 535 Updated SSRA Figure 6.3.6-2: Effect of Changing the Aerosol Infection Threshold on the Number of Premises Initially Infected for a Release Due to Lack of HEPA Filtration in the BSL3 Animal Room The y-axis shows the percentile of meteorological conditions in which that number of premises (or fewer) are infected. The red line is the baseline threshold, the blue line is based on the minimum infectious dose, and the dotted lines show thresholds two-fold greater or lesser. Even for extremely large aerosol releases, there is a minimal effect of changing the infection threshold. Figure 6.3.6-3 shows the results for two tornado scenarios (with the release of 108 PFU (left panel) and 1010 PFU (right panel)). In the smaller release, the probability of infection of at least one premises increases from 95% to nearly 100%, whereas in the larger release, all tornados cause at least one infection. Regarding the number of initially infected premises, in a smaller release that number typically doubles if the infection threshold is halved (which, as discussed is not as consequential compared to which premises are infected), whereas in larger releases, the number of premises initially infected increases by only about 10%. Using the threshold based on the minimum infectious dose also does not significantly alter the picture (the probability of at least one infection only changes in the smaller release and drops from 95% to 65% in this case). 536 Updated SSRA Figure 6.3.6-3: Effect of Changing the Aerosol Infection Threshold on the Number of Premises Initially Infected for a Release Due to a Tornado. (The left panel is the release of 108 PFU and the right panel is the release of 1010 PFU) The y-axis shows the percentile of meteorological conditions in which that number of premises (or fewer) are infected. The red line is the baseline threshold, the blue line is based on the minimum infectious dose, and the dotted lines show thresholds two-fold greater or lesser. This analysis demonstrates that the initiation of outbreaks due to aerosol releases is relatively insensitive to the threshold used, within a factor of two. The use of the lower threshold based on the chance that a herd would inhale at least 1 PFU (the baseline threshold) may overestimate the risk of FMDv aerosols if the minimum infectious dose reflects a real biological concept. 6.3.6.2 Effect of Direct Contact Rates Although there are good primary data supporting direct contact rates for some premises types (such as the backyard premises developed in this study), the data supporting other contact rates are tenuous (such as those supporting contact rates from goat facilities). For this reason, the effects of using direct contact rates that were two-fold greater or lesser than the baseline were explored. Outbreak duration and head culled is shown as a function of the direct contact rates used in Figure 6.3.6-4. All values are given as a fold increase or decrease over the value using the baseline indirect contact rates. 537 Updated SSRA Figure 6.3.6-4: Effect of Doubling or Halving the Direct Contact Rate on Outbreak Duration (left) or Head Culled (right) Compared to Baseline The y-axis shows the fold increase or decrease in the duration or head culled over baseline in log scale. The effect of changing the direct contact rate for all premises types is relatively modest with few exceptions. In general, the duration or consequences change by less than 30% for a two-fold change in the direct contact rate. However, for a few premises and outputs (like the feedlot starting location and the p5 output), the extent and duration can change by ten-fold. 6.3.6.3 Effect of Indirect Contact Rates The evidence basis for indirect contact rates is more tenuous than that supporting direct contact rates. This paucity of evidence is partially due to the variety of services that a livestock premises can receive that contribute to the indirect contact rate (veterinary services, hoof trimming, husbandry services, etc). Also, underpinning the indirect contact rates is the number of premises that would be visited in a timeframe after visiting an infected premises and the degree to which the service provider adheres to biosanitary guidelines. For this reason, the effects of using indirect contact rates that were two-fold greater or lesser than the baseline were explored. Outbreak duration and head culled is shown as a function of the indirect contact rates used in Figure 6.3.6-5. All values are given as a fold increase or decrease over the value using the baseline indirect contact rates. As shown, the effect of changing the indirect contact rates is significant across almost all starting locations, vaccination strategies, or NAADSM outputs considered. In many cases, outbreak duration changes by more than an order of magnitude. Regarding duration, if a reduction in the indirect contact rate does not significantly curtail the outbreak, the increase in contact rates typically increases the duration significantly (and vice-versa). Generally, this effect is due to outbreaks that are already short or long before the indirect contact rate was changed, which affords less opportunity to increase or decrease the duration further. Regarding head culled, increases in contact rates can increase the impact for all but the smallest outbreaks (cow-calf p5) by about a factor of three, whereas decreases in the 538 Updated SSRA Figure 6.3.6-5: Effect of Doubling or Halving the Indirect Contact Rate on Outbreak Duration (left) or Head Culled (right) Compared to Baseline The y-axis shows the fold increase or decrease in the duration or head culled over baseline in log scale. indirect contact rates can decrease the impact by more than an order of magnitude. The fact that increased contact rates do not more significantly exacerbate the outbreak is probably due to the fact that large outbreaks are already limited by a lack of susceptible animals to infect. 6.3.6.4 Conclusions These analyses demonstrate that caution should be used when using the results to predict the absolute impact and duration of an outbreak of FMD in the US. The contact rates used in NAADSM are based on limited data and the results are sensitive to small changes (a factor of two) in these values. The sensitivity of the results to these parameters demonstrates how important the collection of additional primary data is to reduce the effect of uncertainty. That being said, uncertainties in the starting location of the outbreak and in the modeling output itself (both largely functions of aleatory, or irreducible, uncertainty) produce greater variance in possible results (outbreaks caused by release events can be a small as a few thousand animals to more than 30 million culled). This variance is caused by factors such as the meteorological conditions that prevail when a release happens, or if the infection starts in a herd owned by a producer who will call a veterinarian upon the recognition of strange signs in his animals, or the timing of an animal shipment relative to the spread of the illness. This is all to say that the range in possible results presented for the impact of an outbreak is still representative of the likely impact of the disease, even given significant uncertainty in the modeling parameters. These analyses also demonstrate that the modeling results are best used comparatively. The relative impact of releases caused by different events can still be compared, as can the relative benefit of adopting enhanced detection or mitigation measures. 539 Updated SSRA 540 Updated SSRA 7. Economic Assessment 7.1 Objective The Economic Assessment task evaluated producer and consumer welfare impacts to the agricultural sector resulting from unintentional releases of FMD, projected the costs and disruptions to non- agricultural activities in the epidemiologically impacted region, and assessed the costs of response surveillance, quarantine, appraisal, euthanasia, disposal, clean-up and disinfection, vaccination, and indemnity payments traditionally associated with risk scenarios and disease outbreaks. Significant changes to the Economic Assessment since the 2010 SSRA include 1) extending the simulation period (the updated model is simulated over 10 years as opposed to 5 years in the 2010 SSRA), 2) updating price forecasts, and 3) reporting additional consequences within each event to better reflect uncertainty. Given the first two changes described above, the consumer and producer welfare outputs reported below are improved. Results reported in this section are conditional upon a release and/or outbreak of FMD occurring, the associated epidemiological output reported in Section 6, and other assumptions documented below. The economic consequences reported in this Section are then used as inputs for Section 8, Risk Calculations. 7.2 Technical Approach The primary modeling approach used to determine the economic effects on agricultural producers and consumers included but was not limited to the following market sectors of significance: beef, swine, dairy cattle, sheep, grain, and forages at the national levels. The general methodology relied on the use of a partial equilibrium, multi-market model of the livestock and grain sectors supplemented with a regional input-output economic model to account for regional impacts on the nonagricultural sectors [following Pendell et al., 2007]. Input-output models provide measures of short-run impacts across broad sectors of the economy. Assessment of a finer level of fidelity is facilitated with the use of partial equilibrium and/or multi-market models [Rich, Winter-Nelson, and Miller, 2005]. A partial equilibrium, multi-market, microeconomic model provided the appropriate level of fidelity to assess consequences for the 2010 SSRA and the Updated SSRA, beginning with livestock and grain production to meat processing through the supply chain and onto domestic and international customers. Changes in producer and consumer welfare presented in the report provide a comprehensive measure of the market changes for all products in the livestock and grain sectors along the entire supply chain [Just, Hueth, and Schmitz, 2004]. Assessing the grain sector is important as it provides input (i.e., feed) to the livestock sector. Information on the direct cost to the government was drawn from recent economic literature and combined with output from the epidemiological model and market data to calculate government costs. The additional impact on businesses in allied nonagricultural \u0011 E ! egional Input Output Modeling System). 541 - Table 7 .2.1 1: Regio nal Economic Value of Li vestock S ecto rs Beef Ca ttle Swine Milk Prod uction State Gross Income Gross Income Value of Milk Prod uced (Millio ns) Primar y Region CO SSRA Given the wide range of potential outcomes from, and inherent uncertainty in, an FMD outbreak, economic consequences were assessed to represent a range of the distribution of outcomes provided by the epidemiological model. As in the 2010 SSRA, economic consequences are reported for the distribution of outcomes at the p5 level (meaning 5% of the epidemiological model outcomes resulted in lower epidemiological outputs, at the pp50 (median), and at the pp95 level (meaning 95% of the epidemiological model outcomes resulted in lower epidemiological outputs). In effect this provides lower, average, and upper measures of economic consequences that may arise from an FMD outbreak. To better reflect uncertainty and carry uncertainty thorough the economic model, additional consequences are reported for the p5, p50, and p95 outcomes. These outcomes are representative of uncertainty inherent in the different starting locations for infection. 7.2.1 Regional Background The primary region of focus for the economic assessment includes Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado, Missouri, Iowa, and Texas. In this region, livestock is economically important (see Table 7.2.1-1). From 2008 USDA/NASS data, cattle and calves are the most valuable agricultural commodity in four states in the study. Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, and Colorado are ranked in the top five for cattle on feed. However, hogs are recognized as one of the top five commodities in seven of the states. Dairy is also significant percentage of state farm receipts in the region. Additional background on the economic value of livestock sectors in the regions of interest is provided in Table 7.2.1-1. These data were taken from USDA/NASS reports and summarize the estimated gross income generated by beef cattle and swine in 2009. The final column reports the value of milk produced for the same year. In most states, income from beef cattle clearly dominates gross for swine which is second in magnitude.

Member countries can self declare freedom of a country, zone, or compartment from an OIE listed disease. However, OIE does not recognize self declaration for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), FMD, Rinderpest and Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia. If a notification is made for a particular disease, immediate international and domestic trade restrictions are likely for specific species and their products. FMD The U.S. has been an FMD-free country since 1929. FMD is an OIE listed and notifiable disease. Agricultural sectors with high probability of immediate international trade restrictions after notification include cattle, swine, sheep, and goats. Chapter 8.5 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code provides protocol for FMD. Article 8.5.8 outlines the guidelines for Recovery of Free Status: When an FMD outbreak or FMD infection occurs in an FMD free country or zone where vaccination is not practiced, one of the following waiting periods is required to regain the status of FMD free country or zone where vaccination is not practiced: a) 3 months after the last case where a stamping-out policy and serological surveillance are applied in accordance with Articles 8.5.40. to 8.5.46.; or b) 3 months after the slaughter of all vaccinated animals where a stamping-out policy, emergency vaccination and serological surveillance are applied in accordance with Articles 8.5.40. to 8.5.46.; or c) 6 months after the last case or the last vaccination (according to the event that occurs the latest), where a stamping-out policy, emergency vaccination not followed by the slaughtering of all vaccinated animals, and serological surveillance are applied in accordance with Articles 8.5.40. to 8.5.46., provided that a serological survey based on the detection of antibodies to nonstructural proteins of FMD demonstrates the absence of infection in the remaining vaccinated population. Where a stamping-out policy is not practiced, the above waiting periods do not apply, and Article 8.5.2. or 8.5.4. applies. 7.2.2.2 Effective Trade Bans In addition to trade bans specified by national and international standards, an important consideration is an effective trade ban. Effective trade bans reflect the changes in commerce (e.g., consumer behavior) that can augment the impacts of actual trade bans or cause significant economic disruption in the absence of any officially mandated ban. Effective trade bans can be persistent over long periods of time. For example, while many countries have lifted trade bans on U.S. beef products, until recently Japan imposed trade restrictions on U.S. beef imports due to the three BSE cases in the U.S. from 2003 to 2006. 543 Updated SSRA 7.3 Methods 7.3.1 Partial Equilibrium Model for the Agricultural Sector equilibrium model [Paarlberg, 2008] to assess the economic impacts of the livestock and grain sectors. Although other economic models for disease outbreaks exist for the U.S. [Pendell et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2006], the Paarlberg [2008] model is the most comprehensive economic model available to complete the analysis for the Updated SSRA. Similar to Rich and Winter-Nelson [2007], who assessed FMD outbreaks in South America, it incorporates both spatial and temporal dimensions - as well as farm and trade policy information - necessary to appropriately model impacts of disease outbreaks in livestock. Major updates of the Paarlberg, Seitzinger, Lee, and Mathews model since the 2010 SSRA include 1) extending the simulation period (the updated model is simulated over 10 years as opposed to 5 years in the 2010 SSRA) and 2) updating price forecasts. Given these changes, the reported changes in consumer and producer welfare given below are improved. The modeling framework integrated the North American Animal Disease-Spread Model (NAADSM) epidemiological model results (i.e., supply shocks) as input into the economic components to estimate the economic impacts of outbreaks of FMD. It assessed the effects of a disease outbreak on major agricultural sectors livestock and crops along vertical market chains, for agricultural inputs (wheat, coarse grains, rice, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, forage and pasture), production (cattle, hogs, poultry, lamb and sheep, dairy, and eggs), processing (beef and cattle, pork and hogs, lamb and sheep, poultry and birds), and consumption (beef, pork, poultry, lamb and sheep, dairy, eggs, rice, coarse grains, wheat, soybean oil); and it projected the impacts of the disease outbreak over 40 calendar quarters. Of particular importance to the 2010 SSRA and Updated SSRA, this model allowed the opportunity to assess impacts of FMD supply shocks on the beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and grains sectors for domestic and international markets, as well as the feed sector. It also allowed for the flexibility to include domestic consumer shocks and adjustment of the duration and magnitude of trade bans specific to a species of livestock or crop. Complete documentation of the model is provided in Paarlberg et al. [Paarlberg, 2008]. A brief overview of the data, parameters, and inputs (e.g., supply, demand, and trade shocks) used to implement the model is provided below. 7.3.1.1 Data This section contains a summary of the data used in the model taken from Paarlberg [2008]. Quarterly supply, use, and price data were primarily sourced from the Livestock Marketing Information Center (LMIC). However, the LMIC database does not include data for some crops and trade. Quarterly supply, use, and price data for coarse grains, wheat, and rice came from situation reports prepared by the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA/ERS, Outlook series). Quarterly supply and use tables for the soybean complex prepared by ERS cover the later years. Forage prices are from the LMIC database. Total quarterly use was generated by feed balance equations from which data 544 Tab le 7.3.1-1: Ret ail Deman d Elasticities for Agr icul tural Commodi ties Retail Elasticiti es Beef Pork Poultry Lam b CGrain Whe at Rice Milk Soyoil Eggs Beef -0.42 19 0.0295 -0.11 00 0.789 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pork 0.0151 -0.73 97 0.0131 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Poultry -0.04 14 0.0082 -0.09 85 0.263 0 0 0 0 0 0 Lamb 0.789 0 0.263 -1.05 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 CGrain 0 0 0 0 -0.3 0 0 0 0 0 Wheat 0 0 0 0 0 -0.30 9 0.036 0 0 0 Rice 0 0 0 0 0 0.229 -0.32 8 0 0 0 Milk 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -0.30 1 0 0 Soyoil 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -0.31 4 0 Eggs 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -0.11 03 Updated SSRA o n animal numbers were combined with standard feeding practices to produce quarterly amounts of forage and pasture. Production of hay, corn silage, and sorghum silage was reported by the National Agricultural Statistics Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Uncut grazed pasture was imputed for quarters 2 and 3. Trade data were derived from LMIC and ERS reports, as well as the U.S. Customs through the Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Policy information affecting the crop components of the model came from various sources; including Provisions of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 [Nelson & Schertz, 1996] and the 2002 Farm Act [Westcott et al., 2002]. 7.3.1.2 Parameters Model parameters included livestock-feed balance information, revenue and factor shares, and elasticities. The livestock-feed balance information, revenue shares, and factor shares were retained as defined in the Paarlberg et al. [Paarlberg, 2008]. The retail elasticity values (provided in Table 7.3.1-1) for final meat demand for beef, pork, and poultry [Tonsor, Mintert, and Schroeder, 2010], lamb, [Shiftlett et al., 2007] and milk [Zheng and Kaiser, 2008] were updated for this study. Substitution elasticities for derived demand and trade elasticities remained unchanged. Price Expectations The model required an assumption about livestock grower expectations regarding prices and future returns. In this study, producer decisions regarding livestock production were adjusted, to the outbreak, by equating expected future returns to current returns for livestock (i.e., na\u00efve expectations) [Paarlberg et al., 2009]. Na\u00efve price expectations were assumed for all scenarios. 7.3.1.3 Economic Shocks An FMD outbreak will result in supply shocks (resulting from culling of animals and movement restrictions), international demand shocks (resulting from trade bans or restrictions), and domestic demand shocks (resulting from adverse reaction from consumers to the outbreak). The supply shocks (i.e., the number of depopulated animals) were derived from the epidemiological disease spread models for FMD and were integrated into the quarterly economic model as percent changes in quantity. Economic impacts for the agricultural sector were determined by summing the quarterly impacts to 545 Tab le 7.3.1-2: Number of Ani mal s in Impac ted R egion CO IA MO NE SSRA producer consumers to determine the economic impacts of the FMD outbreaks. The model solved for the percent changes in the endogenous variables (prices and quantities) for each quarter and each agricultural sector. The percent changes were applied to a baseline defined by the observed data for the first quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of 2018. Thus, actual market price and quantity movements during the period were reflected in the baseline. Supply Shocks In particular, the data from NAADSM were used to calculate the expected number of animals for each scenario. The production types used in NAADSM were adjusted to allow for use in the partial equilibrium economic model. Table 7.3.1-2 lists the animal population by production type across each state. Additional information used was the number of herds by production type across each state (Table 7.3.1\u00ad 3). The production types required by the partial equilibrium economic model are beef cattle, dairy, slaughter cattle, swine and sheep. The production types in Table 7.3.1-2 and Table 7.3.1-3 were adjusted as follows: Cow-Calf + Beef (backyard) = beef cattle; Dairy = dairy; Feedlot (small) + Feedlot (large) = beef slaughter; Swine (small) + Swine (large) + Swine (backyard); Goats + Sheep + Small ruminants (backyard) = sheep. 546 Table 7.3.1 -3: Nu mber of Herds in Impacted Region CO IA MO NE OK TX KS Cattle Facilities (small) 2,405 6,561 896 1,718 8,039 410 2,485 Feedlot (large) 168 7 4 287 912 198 221 Beef (backyard) 4,151 3,870 8,433 954 587 353 440 529 Swine (large) 19 8,658 749 1,379 234 57 722 Swine (backyard) 898 report the average number of animals and herds culled by event, respectively. Tabl es 7.3.1-6 and 7.3.1-7 report the average number of animals and herds that were vaccinated by event, respectively. Numbers are reported at the p5, p50, and p95 epidemiological output levels p95 location quartiles. In all FMD outbreaks, emergency vaccination was assumed, which is discussed in more detail in the outcomes section below. In the economic modeling, two emergency vaccinations scenarios are assumed: vaccinate- to-kill and vaccinate- to-live. For releases <180 days (corresponding to small to medium size releases), the vaccinate- to-kill scenario was assumed where all vaccinated animals were assumed to be culled. For large releases (corresponding to >180 days) , vaccinated cattle were assumed to remain in the cattle inventory. Depending on the scenario (vaccinate\u00adto-kill or vaccinate- to-live), the average numbers of animals culled and/or animals vaccinated reported below were used in calculating the supply shock. Additionally, the average number of animals culled, herds culled, animals vaccinated, and herds vaccinated were used in estimating the governmental costs, which are discussed in the Government Costs section. The events modeled in this section of the Updated SSRA include: Liquid A, Liquid B, Liquid C, Liquid D, Non Containment Aerosol (OA), Solid Waste Transfer Station, Solid Waste Landfill, Transference, Tornado Medium, Tornado High, and Earthquake High. Only one aerosol event (Non Containment Aerosol (OA)) is reported throughout Section 7 because the probability of a complete HEPA failure in any of the rooms is less than 1 \u00d7 10 -30 . Thus, an infection due to a complete HEPA failure from a room within containment (given the fully redundant in-series HEPA filtration caisson designed for the NBAF) is 547 Tab le7.3.1-4: Ave rage N umber of Ani mal s Culled b y Even t Produc tion Typ e Event Output/Location Beef Slaughter Cattle Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep Liquid A p5/p5 0 0 0 0 420 p5/p50 Same as p5/p5 p5/p95 325 0 No animals are culled be a non-credible event. For more discussion on the events modeled in this section, see Sections 4, 5 and 6. Uncertainty due to starting location is explored more rigorously in the Updated SSRA (see Section 6 for more discussion). For each release event (e.g., Liquid A, Liquid B, etc.), all plausible operations (e.g., cow-calf operations, dairy operations, etc.) were modeled as if each operation housed the index case. NAADSM provided distributions of outcomes ( i.e., for number of animals and herds culled, number of animals and herds vaccinated, and duration) for each index case. The median output (p50) from NAADSM for each index case was then ranked by the severity of the outbreak (animals culled) to generate distributions of output (e.g., a distribution representing the number of animals culled). From that process, the p5, p50, and p95 epidemiological output s (i.e., number of animals and herds culled, number of animals and herds vaccinated, and duration) were reported and used in the economic modeling. As an example, consider the p5/p5 Liquid A event. The 1st p5 represents the p5 outcome in the distribution of culled animals, which was in fact the p50 outcome of a NAADSM distribution for a specific location. The 2nd p5 value refers to the p5 value of the distribution from the NAADSM specific run for a location . 548 Table7.3.1 -4: Average Number of Animals Culled by Event Production Type Event Output/Location Beef Slaughter Cattle Beef Cows Dairy Swine culled No animals are culled Station p5/p50 p5/p95 No animals are culled 57 p50/p5 0 0 0 0 p50/p50 0 0 79 0 p5/p50 Same as p5/p5 Same as p5/p5 p5/p95 Average Number of Animals Culled by Event Production Type Event Output/Location Beef Slaughter Cattle Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep p50/p5 3,417,986 0 0 2,596,428 by Event Production Type Event Output/ Location Beef Slaughter Cattle Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep Liquid A p5/p5 0 0 0 0 4 p5/p50 Same a s p5/p5 2 14 251 773 0 530 602 p5/p95 2 0 0 0 14 p50/p5 53 21 18 p50/p50 482 397 254 642 p50/p95 1,395 1,099 558 2,380 p5/p50 No animals are culled p5/p95 3 1 0 0 0 23 293 952 0 852 611 p50/p5 149 58 33 448 96 67 96 59 p5/p50 266 108 71 103 68 95 0 260 929 1,034 1,160 919 p5/p95 401 179 104 157 Same p5/p5 p5/p5 0 259 4 0 2 0 3 p5/p50 23 12 6 6 10 75 9 273 516 p5/p95 174 91 74 93 p50/p5 97 29 14 25 p50/p50 666 3,687 425 285 of Herds Culled by Event Production Type Event Output/ Location Beef Slaughter Cattle Beef Cows Dairy Swine are culled p5/p50 No animals are culled p5/p95 No animals are culled p50/p5 0 0 0 0 2 p50/p50 Same as p50/p5 p50/p95 Same as p50/p5 p95/p5 98 12 9 3,202 387 p95/p95 1,888 2,347 540 2,563 394 Solid Waste Landfill p5/p5 0 0 0 1 0 p5/p50 Same as p5/p5 p5/p95 Same as p5/p5 p50/p5 23 7 4 8 0 p50/p50 28 8 4 8 0 p50/p95 507 177 177 1,631 243 p95/p5 436 0 3 4 1 p5/p50 45 4 3 5 1 p5/p95 200 57 45 66 32 p50/p5 355 0 1 0 0 0 0 p5/p50 49 8 5 8 7 p5/p95 100 26 20 34 13 p50/p5 15 6 3 2 1 p50/p50 80 17 17 24 13 p50/p95 254 83 62 1,638 39 p95/p5 78 11 4 12 10 p95/p50 642 17 375 - Culled by Event Production Type Event Output/ Location Beef Slaughter Cattle Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep Torn ado High p5/p5 378 0 0 781 0 p5/p50 267 12 4 917 7 21 p5/p95 374 39 31 958 p50/p5 285 0 0 874 0 0 p50/p50 1,098 2 789 p50/p95 2,693 598 3,403 Earth quake High p5/p5 1 0 0 0 0 p5/p50 39 12 11 10 7 p5/p95 587 21 14 608 13 6 p50/p5 12 1 3 1 p50/p50 100 51 22 52 19 291 p50/p95 1,862 451 568 2,986 p95/p5 21 -6: Average of Animals Vaccinated by Event Production Type Event Output/Location Beef Slaughter Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep Cattle Liquid A p5/p5 9,715 of Animals Vaccinated by Event Production Type Event Output/Location Beef Slaughter Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep Cattle Transfer p5/p50 No animals are Station of Animals Vaccinated by Event Production Type Event Output/Location Beef Slaughter Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep Cattle Solid Waste p5/p5 1,602 4,544 144 965 207 Landfill Ave rage N umber of Ani mal s Vaccinated by Eve nt Produc tion Typ e Event Output/Location Beef Slaught er Cattle Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep Earthquake p5/p5 Herds Vaccinated b y Ev ent Produc tion Typ e Event Output/ Location Beef Slaughter Cattle Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep Liquid A Liquid B p5/p5 16 105 5 36 13 p5/p50 Same as p5/p5 p5/p95 3 46 3 7 6 p50/p5 242 are culled p5/p95 4 46 2 Average Number of Herds Vaccinated by Event Production Type Event Output/ Location Beef Slaughter Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep Cattle Liquid C p5/p5 as p5/p50 363 1,353 119 439 Transfer p5/p50 No animals are culled Station p5/p95 No animals are culled p50/p5 8 155 8 17 32 p50/p50 p50/p95 Same of Herds Vaccinated by Event Production Type Event Output/ Location Beef Slaughter Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep Cattle Solid Waste p5/p5 5 69 4 6 12 Landfill p5/p50 Same as p5/p5 p5/p95 Same as p5/p5 p50/p5 57 782 44 80 84 p50/p50 128 919 560 29 1,218 p5/p50 181 1,139 35 95 127 p5/p95 422 3,157 155 357 372 p50/p5 58 488 16 42 46 p50/p50 375 2,662 Average Number of Herds Vaccinated by Event Production Type Event Output/ Location Beef Slaughter Beef Cows Dairy Swine Sheep Cattle Earthquake p5/p5 3 46 3 7 8 High p5/p50 143 1,408 shocks used in this study.

As such, consumer demand shocks were incorporated to allow variations in the level of consumer perception of food quality from a hypothetical FMD event [Piggott and Marsh, 2004]. These parameters indicate the share of the population cutting consumption of a final good and provide a policy instrument by which to manage impacts on final demand. There have been no FMD events on the U.S. mainland in recent history that provides data on consumer responsiveness, so it is necessary to draw information from other events and from other countries to provider reasonable and plausible guidelines for parameter choices. Various studies have quantified the impact of consumer demand in the U.S. to livestock disease outbreaks. Piggott and Marsh [2004], using quarterly annual data from 1982 to 1999 for the U.S., reported that the impact on beef demand to public food safety information was statistically significant, but on average small and short lived (i.e., a shock of 1 quarter after the event). Beef demand decreased as much as 5.9% in one quarter to public food safety information over the period from 1982 to 1999. Marsh, Schroeder, and Mintert [2004] examined consumer responses to meat product recalls in the United States. Meat product recalls included - but were not limited to \u00adSalmonella, Listeria, E. coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus, Trichinae, Hepatitis A, and other contaminants. They reported that the impact on beef demand to meat recalls was statistically significant. On average the impact was small and short lived, but the likelihood of larger responses coincided with larger recalls. Coffey et al. [2005] provided a summary of survey results from different sources related to BSE announcements. They reported that across five different surveys that between 14 and 29 percent of respondents reported reducing their beef consumption. Survey results from Thilmany, Umberger, and Ziehl [2004] concluded that the BSE incident generated a 13% demand reduction. Several studies have examined response to BSE using weekly grocery store scanner data. Kuchler and Tegene [2006] used weekly sales from 1998 to 2004 to examine the impact of the BSE case in 2003. For the Washington State BSE case, they find the impact on fresh beef purchase to be short-lived with week 1 purchase to be 32.6% lower and week 2 purchase to be 18.7% lower. Schlenker and Villas-Boas [2009], using transaction level data, reported that sales (not demand) fell 21% during the first 35 days following the announcement of BSE. Losses recovered to about a 10% decline by day 90. While informative as to the 562 Tab le 7.3.1-9: De man d Shocks Event Output/Loc ation Outbreak End of Outbreak +1 End of Outbreak +2 End of Outbreak +3 End of Outbreak +4 End of Outbreak +5 End -5.0% -2.50% Updated SSRA duration of consumer shock, scanner data is not based on statistically drawn sample, which makes the magnitude of the shock less useful for analyzing current market conditions [Hahn et al., 2009]. FMD outbreaks have been experienced in other countries, including the UK in 2001. Consumers in the UK decreased their average weekly per capita carcass meat consumption from 235 grams in 2001 to 229 grams in 2002 (or 2.7%). Consumption in the UK recovered to pre-outbreaks levels by 2006 [UK DEFRA, updated 1/14/2010]. A survey of European citizens in March and April 2006 questioned over 25,000 EU citizens on avian influenza, reporting that 50% of those questioned did not believe that eating meat from vaccinated birds carries no risk to human health [Scudamore 2007]. Although these results represent stated and not actual outcomes, the findings suggest consumers can be concerned about consumption of meat and other products from vaccinated animals. Given the above information, demand shocks were specified for FMD across the events. Based on the epidemiological output (see Tables 7.1.3-4 and 7.1.3-6) smaller (larger) outbreaks coincided with outbreaks that lasted shorter (longer) than 1 quarter. Consequently, following a small FMD outbreak (lasting less than one quarter), it was assumed that 5% of people would refrain from consuming beef, pork, and lamb while 2.5% would stop consuming milk and dairy products during the outbreak. In the second quarter, consumer demand for beef, pork and lamb declined by 2.5% and was fully recovered (i.e., 0% decline) for dairy and milk products (see Table 7.3.1-9 for an example, Liquid A p5/p5). It was assumed that consumer demand for meat products would be fully recovered by the third quarter. In outbreaks lasting more one quarter (which corresponded to larger outbreaks), it was assumed that 10% of consumers would refrain from consuming beef, pork and lamb while 5% would stop consuming milk and dairy products during the outbreak. Following the outbreak, it was assumed that consumer demand would decrease by 5% for one quarter and 2.5% for another quarter for beef, pork, and lamb. Consumer demand for dairy and milk products would decline by 2.5% for 1 quarter following the outbreak (see Table 7.3.1-9 for an example, Liquid A p50/p50). These assumptions are supported by the quantitative findings of the studies discussed above. They are also consistent with previous modeling efforts to estimate economic consequences of FMD outbreaks. Paarlberg et al. [2003] assume 5% of the consumers no longer eat beef and veal when examining FMD outbreaks in the United States. Zhao et al. [2006] use a 5% decrease in domestic demand when simulating FMD events in the United States. Nogueira et al. [2011] applied a 5% decrease in domestic demand when simulating FMD outbreaks in Mexico. Tozer et al. [2011] applied a 5% decrease in domestic demand when simulating FMD outbreaks in Australia. 563 Table 7.3.1 -10: Percentage Change Of International Trade Following FMD Outbreaks by Event Initial Ongoing Post Outbreaks Outbreak Outbreak Output / Event Trade Shocks The magnitude and duration of trade shocks assumed for this study were based on observations from previous events in, and studies about, the U.S. and across the world. In 2003 and 2004, due to isolated incidences of BSE, the U.S. and Canada faced complete bans on beef in major overseas markets while beef and cattle imports and exports continued among the North America Free Trade Agreement countries (Canada, Mexico, and the United States) under a variety of restrictions [Blayney, 2005]. Th e U.S. has experienced a long recovery relative to pre-outbreak trade status as a result the isolated BSE events. U.S. beef exports, as a percentage of beef production was 9.6% in 2003, dropped dramatically to 1.9% in 2004, and recovered to 7.1% in 2008 [USDA-ERS]. A review of the economic literature on previous events and research is useful in identifying plausible time lengths defining trade bans for FMD scenarios. The EU imposed a one year ban on the UK following its 2001 FMD outbreak. Rich and Winter-Nelson [2007] studied FMD outbreaks during 2000-2001 in the southern cone of South America, reporting short lived impacts on exports to Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. In modeling exercises, they assumed exports to fully resume sixteen weeks after the end of the outbreak was declared. Randolph et al. [2005] examined FMD outbreaks in Zimbabwe, and assumed a 12 month export ban. Nogueira et al. [2011] and Tozer et al. [2011] apply 1 to 2 year trade bans for hypothetical FMD outbreaks in Mexico and Australia, respectively. Although the actual length of export restrictions will depend upon the actual product, disease, trade agreements, and countries involved, these observations provide informative guidelines for the economic model assumptions and simulations. Based on the above information trade shocks were constructed in the following manner. First, 95% of all U.S. exports of beef, pork, lamb meat, cattle, swine, and sheep were halted during the full quarter of the outbreak and for one quarter after the last case appears. This assumes some processed/cooked beef is still exported after the outbreak. Interrupting exports for one quarter beyond the end of the outbreak (and for two quarters beyond the end of the outbreak when emergency vaccination is practiced and not followed by slaughter) was consistent with OIE guidelines and practices (Chapter 8.5) during FMD outbreaks [OIE, 2009]. Second, after the additional quarter ended with no FMD reported, it was assumed that U.S. exports of the embargoed products gradually recovered over the subsequent quarters towards the baseline levels. Full recovery was assumed to occur in approximately two years (immediately following one full quarter after the outbreak is contained) as defined in Table 7.3.1-10. For FMD, the duration of the outbreak becomes a critical element in determining the economic effects from trade disruptions. 564 Updated SSRA 7.3.1.4 Outcomes Consumer and Producer Welfare The model provided estimates of changes in per capita consumer welfare between the baseline case with no FMD outbreak and one of the previously defined outbreak events. The economic welfare of consumers was measured by the difference between what consumers were willing to pay and what they must pay for each unit consumed. The changes in consumer welfare were adjusted by the consumer welfare foregone by non-consuming individuals. Producer welfare was represented by changes in quasi-profits and captured by returns to capital and management (not sales). Producer welfare measured welfare changes along the supply change including meat processing, egg and layers, dairy cattle and milk, beef cattle, swine, lambs and sheep, crops and soybeans. Producer welfare was adjusted for the value of animals lost due to the FMD outbreak and for the indemnification payment to producers. Indemnification payments compensate producers for asset losses incurred due to lost animals, and were assumed to be a transfer from the government to the producer. The results were generated under two emergency vaccination scenarios: 1) vaccinate- to-kill and 2) vaccinate- to-live. For small to medium sized releases (<180 days), the vaccinate- to-kill scenario was assumed where all removed animals culled or vaccinated were assumed to be depopulated. This is incorporated into the study by extending the decline in international trade by 95% for one quarter beyond the end of the outbreak (i.e., an outbreak lasting one quarter would result in a decline of 95% of trade for two quarters). For large releases (>180 days), vaccinated cattle were assumed to remain in the cattle inventory. The vaccinate- to-live scenarios extend the export ban for two quarters beyond the end of the outbreak (i.e., an outbreak that last four quarters would result in a decline of 95% of trade for six quarters). Consumer demand and trade shocks for both are defined above. Regionalization/zoning was not assumed for the vaccinate- to-kill and the vaccinate- to-live scenarios. Rather, uniform trade bans for the entire U.S. were applied for both. See Tozer et al. [2011] for additional details on the economic consequences of regional and uniform trade ban policies from FMD outbreaks. Furthermore, no adjustments were imposed on the model related to changes in slaughter capacity or changes in capital investment in the livestock sector. The performer acknowledges that there are limitations with these assumptions. For example, vaccinate- to-slaughter or mixed strategies are also plausible alternatives. Response to a FMD outbreak will likely include a combination of culling, vaccinate- to-kill, and vaccinate\u00ad to-slaughter depending on the factors such as the animal species affected, geographic area, number of infected animals, trade restrictions, proximity of processing plants, etc. 7.3.2 Regional Non -Agricultural Impacts Input-output modeling can be traced back to the Nobel Prize winning work of Leontief [1936] [Irwin, Issermann, Kilkenny, and Partridge, is a system of linear equations that describe the circular flow of income and product throughout an economy. A key issue in economic impact analysis is defining the region of interest. The more narrowly defined a region the greater degree 565 Updated SSRA nomy. Likewise one must understand the concept of an economic multiplier which measures the effect of an economic shock (either positive or negative) on a specific sector of the economy. Multipliers are in general greater than 1.0 as they measure a total effect which subsumes indirect effects relative to the direct effects alone. The economic impact of a shock in one industry on other industries in the region will depend on the degree of economic dependence or interaction that exists between those industries. Thus, an industry using locally-produced inputs would have more effect on an economy than an industry that does not. Agricultural economists have applied input-output modeling to rural issues and improved the technique. For example, Little and Doeksen [1968] devised a procedure to measure leakages from the local economy and Heady and Sonka [1974] combined input-output and math programming. For many years survey-based input-output modeling was utilized and was extremely expensive. Eventually, researchers turned to governmental income accounting data [Round 1983]. While various input-output models arose during this period, two systems, developed with initial government funding, have continued to be expanded and refined. The first, developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis is RIMSII (Regional Input-Output Modeling System), is the approach used in the Updated SSRA. The second is IMPLAN (Impact Analysis for Planning), originally developed by the Forest Service, which is now privately- maintained. Note that these models assume a simple production relationship and do not capture substitution effects that may occur during an economic shock (especially a longer lasting shock). However, estimates of these effects are a significant additional computational burden and not readily available. The livestock sectors affected by an outbreak are directly linked to both input and output markets. Production inputs such as feed, fuel, and fertilizer are directly purchased by livestock producers. Similarly, the animals produced by various farm types may move from farm to farm, or as a finished animal or product moves into the agribusiness value chain for processing. While clear direct market chain relationships exist, the effects of which are captured by the partial equilibrium model for the agricultural sector, there are also well-known indirect effects on a local economy when an economic enterprise increases or decreases production. For example, a processing plant will create employment and those employees are likely to purchase a wide variety of goods and services such as medical care, entertainment and other goods that are not directly related to the manufacturing plant. Thus, the regional impacts of an economic shock were evaluated separately because of the localized effects. These impacts may be contrasted with the broader economy consumer demand and trade shocks resulting from an outbreak. For the non-agricultural impacts, input-output industrial multipliers were obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and these data were chosen because they provided a well accepted and validated methodology to evaluate these impacts. Moreover, the multipliers were readily available with flexibility to define the states defined in the primary and secondary regions in the study. The outcomes of the RIMSII model compare favorably to alternative regional economic models. Specifically, a RIMSII, \u0011E! -O table, integrates the input and output relationships of approximately 500 U.S. industries and regional economic accounts. The final-demand multipliers for output are used in 566 Tab le 7.3.2-1: Allocation o f Travel Expenditure by Cat egory (%) Air Transportation Transit and Ground Passe nger Transportation Spectato r Sports Hotels and Motels, Including Casino Hotels Food Service 29.10 13.95 10.80 19.08 27.08 Updated SSRA this analysis to estimate the indirect economic activity generated by a specific economic activity in a region (with the producer and consumer welfare measures of the partial equilibrium model capturing the direct effects on the agricultural sector). Thus, the intent of using the RIMSII data was to measure the effects of an FMD event on the non-agricultural regional economy. Calculations were structured to remove duplication or double counting of losses. Three livestock sectors were broken out to individual indirect effects beef cattle, dairy and milk production, and other livestock including sheep. Three indirect effects were evaluated in the primary modeling region: first, the effect of culling and destroying animals on the non-agricultural regional economy (e.g. retail trade); second, the economic implication of a travel ban that would limit recreational and non-essential travel in and out of a region; and third, the indirect effects from the stimulus to the region created by the expenditures during government clean- up efforts. The effects of travel bans are composed of transit and ground transportation; spectator sports; hotels and motels; and food and drink services. To some extent, the government expenditures and purchases of goods and services while performing a clean-up will stimulate the regional economy. One critical aspect of using regional input-output models to quantify economic impacts is clearly defining the region of interest as the multipliers capture the associated economic activity of a specific region that is not represented. An important attribute of RIMSII is the flexibility to define regions in terms of any combination of contiguous counties. For this analysis, the primary economic region was composed of seven states - Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado. Thus, as production returns to pre-release conditions, the indirect effects to this region dissipate. Because of government indemnification for culled cattle in an FMD event, it is assumed that a farm will resume production after stop movement and quarantines are lifted and the owner is compensated for his losses. After a return to production, the farm would resume its previous contributions to the economic activity in the region. The economic impact from the loss in travel expenditures can be measured using RIMSII [Mak, 1989]. Total domestic travel expenditures for overnight trips and day trips of over 50 miles in 2007 were obtained from the U.S. Statistical abstract produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. These data are reported on a state- by-state basis. However, the RIMSII data separates the economic effects of various forms of travel (Table 7.3.2-1). Thus, using data on the percentage allocations of travel expenditures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, expenditures were allocated by category for each state in the study region (U.S. BLS). 567 Updated SSRA 568 The magnitude of the travel sector in the study states are reported in Table 7.3.2 -2. Table 7.3.2 -2: Travel Expenditures by State and Subcategory State Air Transportation Transit and Ground Passenger Transportation Spectator Sports Hotels and Motels, Including Casino Hotels Food Service (Millions) Texas $12,593 $ 6,037 $ 4,674 $8,255 1,707 $ 818 $ $1,119 $ 1,588 Core total $ 25,841 $12,388 $9,591 $ 16,939 $ 24,043 While not insignificant, travel and tourism is not a dominate sector in the primary region. Kansas, Nebras ka, and Oklahoma each constitute less than 1% of the U.S. domestic travel visits and expenditures (3.1% combined). Travel and tourism are more important in Texas, Colorado and Missouri which contribute 6.7%, 2% and 1.8% of domestic travel visits and expend itures, respectively. Tourism expenditure reduction in the UK following the FMD outbreak in 2001 was 13% [Blake et al., 2002]. This study assumes that travel will be less affected than in the UK because tourism in the UK involves significant rural tourism. Thus, a maximum of 8% annualized reduction on travel within a state is assumed. That is if an outbreak last one year, a state's travel would be reduced by 8%. It also appears likely that in major outbreaks travel restrictions to non -agricultural events w ill be lifted after two quarters so a maximum reduction of 4% of annual travel is realized. For outbreaks of less than two quarters, the travel reduction computed from the number of days the outbreak lasts as a percentage of a full year's reduction. Govern ment Costs Government costs included in this study were appraisal, euthanasia, disposal, cleaning and disinfection, surveillance, indemnification, vaccination, and quarantine. Indemnification costs reflect the value of culled animals in the first quarter p rior to an FMD release using LMIC price data. Costs per animal and herd are based on published literature [Pendell, 2006; Elbakidze et al., 2009] and other assumptions are provided in Table 7.3.2 -3. Indemnification costs per animal were calculated at aver age market prices. Non -indemnification government costs per animal are consistent in magnitude with those reported by Abdalla et al. [2005].

Assumed 3 surveillance visits. 7.4 Results Summary The subsections below summarize the model outputs for the scenarios of epidemiological significance and economic impact. The producer and consumer welfare effects monetize the changes in the well\u00ad being of producers and consumers of agricultural products. The total impact for a scenario was determined as the sum of agricultural producer and consumer welfare plus the government indemnification and non-indemnification expenditures. These results were then added to the non- agricultural sector results for the total impact. Reported scenarios with outbreak lengths greater than or equal to two quarters were modeled as vaccinate- to-live scenarios, while the remaining scenarios were modeled as vaccinate- to-kill. It is important to first provide some general observations regarding the welfare assessments of FMD releases. First, the combined sum of producer and consumer welfare dominates the economic impacts arising from government costs and regional non-agricultural impacts. Second, results indicate that for small and medium sized outbreaks, agricultural producer welfare effects are several times larger than the consumer welfare effects. Producer effects are always negative due to lost output and reduced prices. While producers are burdened with losses, consumers are better off with reduced prices. However, in some cases where supply shocks are small or localized, positive consumer welfare changes could outweigh producer losses (see Paarlberg [2008], Nogueira et al. [2011], and Tozer et al. [2011] for further discussion of such cases). In other words, if adverse consumer reaction to a disease outbreak is small, it is possible for consumers of agricultural products to benefit from a small FMD outbreak because bans on agricultural exports lead to oversupply and reduce domestic meat and dairy prices; these price reductions benefit consumers. For large outbreaks, consumers and producers welfare measures are large and negative. Third, government cost of indemnification and non-indemnification costs are, in general, much lower than the changes in agricultural producer and consumer welfare. Fourth, in every 569 Updated SSRA case, the regional non-agricultural effect is negative as the government indemnification replaces the value of lost animals, but not the full economic impact they have on the region. 7.4.1 Economic Impacts The results summarized in Table 7.4.1-1 by event indicate the total losses range from about 16 billion dollars to 140 billion dollars in damage. To better reflect uncertainty from the epidemiological model the results are reported at the p5, p50, and p95 epidemiological output levels example, epidemiological output quartile and the p50 location quartile. The economic impacts reported below are consistent with other studies, Paarlberg et al. [2003] and Zhao et al. [2006], who examined FMD outbreaks for the U.S. beef cattle sector. Producers share the largest burden in losses. Consumers realize negative or positive effects primarily contingent upon the size of the outbreak, export losses, and assumed demand shocks. Indeed, for events with smaller supply shocks and lower assumed consumer demand reaction, consumers benefit from the outbreak due to lower prices. Regional non-agricultural losses ranged from under 1 to over 6 billion dollars across the scenarios. Government indemnification (non-indemnification) costs range from $0.004 billion to nearly $10 billion ($0.001 billion to over $5 billion). The information reported in Table 7.4.1-1 summarizes the cumulative economic impact across the entire study period for the specified scenarios. However, consequences of disease outbreaks are inherently dynamic in nature with benefits and costs accruing differently to producers and consumers over time; this interplay has important policy implications [Zhao et al., 2006]. To better illustrate the changes in producer and consumer welfare relative to baseline levels over time and along the supply chain, Figures 7.4.1-1 and 7.4.1-2 are provided for the Liquid A p5/p5 event (results for other cases are mostly qualitatively similar, but do vary according to the degree of the outbreak). Figure 7.4.1-1 shows the decomposition of changes in producer welfare for meat processing, egg and layers, dairy cattle and milk, beef cattle, swine, lambs and sheep, crops and soybeans. Outcomes related to goats are combined into sheep and lamb for the purposes of the economic assessment. Focusing on livestock, swine facilities, beef cattle operations, and meat processing are immediately impacted after an outbreak and realize the largest and longest economic distortions. Dairy cattle and milk also are immediately impacted, but to a much lesser degree as consumer confidence is quickly restored and because of the smaller number of dairies in the primary region. Crops exhibit a large negative effect primarily because of demand for feed grains. Lamb and sheep, eggs and layers, and soybean processing are unaffected by the outbreak. As trade restrictions are lifted, changes in producer welfare become positive due to reduced herd sizes and higher prices. By the end of the study period, changes in producer welfare are converging to zero, implying markets are returning to baseline levels. Although periods exist where producer welfare was negative and positive for different sectors, the cumulative change in total producer welfare is negative across all sectors as reported in Table 7.4.1- 1. Figure 7.4.1-2 illustrates changes in total producer and consumer welfare over the study period for the Liquid A p5/p5 event. During the outbreak, changes in consumer and producer welfare are negative. However, after the outbreak is contained, because of lower prices and recovery of consumer demand, consumers become better off. Producers remain worse off until trade restrictions are almost fully 570 Updated SSRA removed. After which, both changes in consumer and producer welfare converge to zero. As reported in Table 7.4.1-1, the cumulative change in producer welfare is negative while change in consumer welfare is positive for this scenario.

The values are calculated conditional on the realizations of the epidemiological output for selected scenarios from Section 6, as well as other mod el assumptions and parameters. The economic consequences are also conditioned on the event that a releas e and/or outbreak has occurred. Section 8 reports the expected economic consequences not conditioned on the event that release and/or outbreak occurs. This section reports two vaccination strategies, vaccinate -to-live and vaccinate -to-kill. It does not represent a definitive study of optimal vaccination strategies for FMD, which is outside the scope of the Updated SSRA. However, it does provide some insig ht into implications of the two strategies. One important assumption in defining the vaccinate -to-live versus vaccinate -to-die strategies was the number of days of the outbreak (<180 days vs. >180 days). There are implications of this assumption. For examp le, if vaccinate -to-kill was chosen for an outbreak longer than 180 days, then there would be more animals culled. It would most likely result in larger supply shocks, and larger negative changes in producer welfare. In addition, the trade ban would be sho rtened by one quarter, per OIE suggested guidelines. This would most likely reduce negative impacts on producers, but may have a mixed impact on consumers. In regards to the government expenditures, there would be higher expenses due to appraisal of herds for culling, cleaning and disinfecting, euthanasia, and carcass disposal; however, there would be no costs associated with vaccination. Overall, because a response to a FMD outbreak will likely include a combination of culling, vaccinate -to-kill, and vacci nate -to-slaughter, important tradeoffs arise Updated SSRA and the total economic consequences are unclear. This calls for a more comprehensive analysis of the vaccination policies, which can more fully and completely address the tradeoffs. 576 Updated SSRA 8. Risk Calculations This section of the Updated SSRA develops a quantitative assessment of the probabilities and economic consequences associated with the potential loss of containment of FMDv from the NBAF over the 50\u00ad year operating lifetime of the facility. This analysis is an update of the 2010 SSRA, which used a scenario- based assessment of risk and presented risk values as the product of the probability of a release and the economic consequence of a release separately for selected release scenarios at a single point in time. The approach used for the initial SSRA utilized conservative estimates of release probabilities and source terms to provide worst-case estimates of risk. This approach allowed scenarios to be ranked in a way that would inform design decisions. However, uncertainty associated with the risk values was not included quantitatively, and the risk values did not lend themselves to the computation of cumulative risk across scenarios or years. Based on feedback from the NAS SSRA Committee, the Updated SSRA presents cumulative probability and risk values across events and over the 50-year operating lifetime of the NBAF, along with quantitative estimates of uncertainty. In this Updated SSRA, risks are again characterized by estimating probabilities and associated economic consequences for potential FMDv loss- of-containment events, and risk values are presented as the product of the probability of a release and the economic consequence of a release. Probabilities, risk values, and associated uncertainties are presented separately for each of the modeled FMDv loss- of\u00ad containment events. In addition, probabilities, risk values, and associated uncertainties are computed cumulatively across events and over time. FMDv loss- of-containment events included in this assessment are described in detail in Section 4. Most of the loss- of-containment events were derived using fault tree analysis. A separate fault tree was constructed for each relevant combination of originating location (BSL-3Ag animal holding rooms (AHRs), BSL-3Ag necropsy suite, BSL- E -containment areas) and release pathway (aerosol, solid waste, liquid waste, or transference). For the transference pathway, multiple loss- of-containment fault trees were generated for each originating location, one corresponding to each applicable mode of transference (e.g., respiratory, hand, foot, body, or fomite). The detailed loss- of-containment fault trees are presented in Section 4.5 and each depicts a series of potential actions, errors, or containment system or process failures that could lead to a loss of FMDv containment. Within each fault tree, each unique outcome represents a separate loss- of-containment event that is mutually exclusive of all other events within the same fault tree (i.e., at a given point in time, only one potential outcome is realized). The resulting events comprise 140 of the 142 loss- of\u00ad containment events included in this Updated SSRA. Two additional events were not modeled through a fault-tree analysis: tornado events and earthquakes. These events are catastrophic events that involve loss of containment from multiple originating locations and through multiple pathways. Details related to these two events are described in Section 4.6. 577 Updated SSRA Section 8.1 presents event-specific risk calculations. In Section 8.2, the event-specific risks are ranked and discussed. Section 8.3 presents cumulative risks, both across events and over time. 8.1 Loss- of-Containment Event-Specific Risk Calculations The risk calculations presented in this section were computed separately for each loss- of-containment fault tree. Within each fault tree, the risks and associated uncertainties were first computed for each individual outcome; risks and uncertainties were then aggregated over all outcomes within a given fault tree. Section 8.1.1 describes the general risk and uncertainty calculation approach. Section 8.1.2 presents risk calculations for the fault trees corresponding to aerosol releases, Section 8.1.3 solid-waste events, Section 8.1.4 liquid-waste events, and Section 8.1.5 transference events. 8.1.1 Risk and Uncertainty Calculation Approach 8.1.1.1 Input Parameters There are three parameters presented in Section 4.5 associated with each outcome in each fault tree that are relevant to the risk calculations: P loss is the probability of a given loss- of-containment outcome.1 The probability of each loss- of\u00ad containment outcome is computed based on the probabilities associated with each step in the sequence that leads to that outcome. For each fault tree, the sum of the individual outcome probabilities is equal to 1. The stochastic variability associated with P loss is based on a binomial distribution and is computed as . Q represents the amount of viable FMDv involved in each loss- of-containment outcome. Q values are determined based on the amount of material present at the originating location, reduced as appropriate by the success or failure of each containment system or process corresponding to the outcome. Low, medium, and high Q values are computed for each loss- of-containment outcome, and typically represent the 5 th percentile, the mean, and the 95th percentile of FMDv involved in the loss or release and are labeled as QL, QM, and QH. The specific basis for each range of Q values is explained in Sections 4.4 and 4.6; in all cases the ranges are based on empirical data and reflect stochastic variation in the amount of material that may be present at a given point in time when a release occurs. RO is the number of opportunities per year corresponding to each fault tree. For example, for the BSL-3Ag AHR aerosol release fault tree, RO represents the total number of days and rooms per year that FMDv-infected animals may be present. For a given day and room in which FMDv\u00ad infected animals are present, one (and only one) of the outcomes associated with the BSL-3Ag AHR aerosol release fault tree will be realized. In most cases, in addition to a point estimate for R O, an estimate of the stochastic variation associated with RO was computed (, the estimated standard deviation associated with RO). 1 In some fault trees, one or more outcomes may be considered to be \"no loss\" outcomes. In order to be complete, all outcomes were included. 578 Updated SSRA In addition to the parameters above, which were derived and presented in Section 4, two additional parameters associated with each outcome for each fault tree that are key to risk calculations include the following: Pi is the conditional probability that a given loss- of-containment outcome results in at least one infection (i.e., an index case). The approaches for estimating Pi vary by pathway and are described in more detail in subsequent sections. Regardless of the pathway, for each event, a separate estimate for Pi is computed for each Q value ( QL, QM, and QH). The resulting conditional probabilities are listed as: P iL, PiM, and PiH. The value PiL is associated with QL, which represents the 5th percentile of possible Q values associated with a given loss- of-containment outcome. In other words, 5% of the time that a loss of containment occurs, the amount of FMDv involved in the release will be Q L or less and the probability of an infection event is PiL. Similarly, 5% of the time that a loss of containment occurs, the amount of FMDv involved in the release will be QH or higher and the probability of an infection event is PiH. The remaining 90% of the time that a loss of containment occurs, the amount of FMDv involved in the release is assumed to be QM and the probability of an infection event is P iM. As a result, the estimate for Pi is obtained as follows: The stochastic variability associated with Pi is based on a binomial distribution and is computed as . 8.1.1.2 Event-Specific Risk Values and Associated Uncertainties For each individual outcome, the input parameters described above were used as input into the following risk calculations: Floss is the expected frequency (per year) at which a given loss- of-containment outcome will occur. It is computed as the product of the probability that the loss- of-containment outcome will occur, given a single opportunity ( Ploss) and the number of opportunities per year ( RO). The uncertainty is based on the uncertainty (stochastic variation) associated with RO as well as the stochastic variability in Ploss. The equations for Floss and the associated uncertainty are: Pevent is the probability that a given loss- of-containment outcome will occur and will result in an infection event (given a single opportunity). It is computed as the probability that the loss- of\u00ad containment will occur ( Ploss) times the conditional probability that an infection event will occur given that the release event occurred ( Pi). Because Ploss is a point estimate, the uncertainty in Pevent is based on the uncertainty associated with Pi. The equation for Pevent is: 579 Updated SSRA The stochastic variability associated with Pevent is based on a binomial distribution and is computed as . Fevent is the expected frequency (per year) at which a given loss- of-containment outcome will occur and will result in an infection event. It is computed as the product of the frequency of the loss- of\u00ad containment outcome and the conditional probability that the loss will result in an infection ( Pi). The equations for Fevent and the associated uncertainty are: Cevent is the estimated economic consequence, given that the loss- of-containment outcome is realized and at least one infection event ensues. For each outcome that may result in at least one infection event, three separate series of economic models are performed, one corresponding to the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile outbreaks (see Section 6 for a description of the epidemiological modeling that provided the input into the economic modeling and Section 7 for the detailed economic modeling results). For each event, the estimated C event value and the associated standard deviation, , are computed by assigning appropriate weighting values to each individual economic outcome and computing the resulting mean and standard deviation. The standard deviation reflects both stochastic variability and uncertainty. Note that if the conditional probability of an infection for a given Q value is zero, the corresponding consequence is not modeled and the corresponding C event terms are set equal to zero. and Risk event is the expected economic consequence associated with a given infection event. It is computed as the expected frequency (per year) at which the loss- of-containment outcome will occur and will result in an infection event, times the expected economic consequence if an infection does occur. The equations for Risk event and the associated uncertainty are as follows: 8.1.1.3 Event-Tree Risk Values and Associated Uncertainties As noted above, the potential infection events are derived based on the loss- of-containment fault trees presented in Section 4.5 (which are organized by release pathway and originating location). For each tree (referred to as an event tree in subsequent discussions), the following aggregate risk calculations are performed: Ptree is the total probability over all possible events within the event tree that an infection will occur (given a single opportunity). For each event tree, Ptree is computed as: 580 Updated SSRA where k is the kth event in the event tree and n is the number of unique events associated with the tree. This equation is based on the assumption that each outcome in the fault tree is mutually exclusive. The associated uncertainty is computed as: Ftree is the expected frequency (per year) at which any event within the event tree will occur and will result in an infection. It is the product of the opportunities per year and Ptree, as defined above. The equations for Ftree and the associated uncertainty are: Ctree is the expected economic consequence associated with the event tree, given that an event in the tree occurs and results in an infection. It is the weighted average of the consequences associated with each of the mutually exclusive outcomes that comprise the tree. The equations for Ctree and the associated uncertainty are: Risk tree is the expected economic consequence associated with the event tree. It is the sum of the risks associated with the mutually exclusive events that comprise the event tree. The equations for Risk tree and the associated uncertainty are: 581 Updated SSRA 8.1.2 Aerosol Events Four aerosol fault trees are presented in Section 4.5: one associated with the BSL-3Ag AHRs; one associated with the BSL-3Ag necropsy suite; one associated with BSL-3E/ BSL-3E SP rooms; and one associated with aerosol releases from non-containment areas. Each fault tree enumerates a series of potential HEPA filter failures and models the probability associated with each potential series of failures and the resulting potential release amounts ( Q values). For each aerosol loss- of-containment outcome, the low, medium, and high Q values presented in Section 4.5 served as input into fate and transport modeling, which is described in detail in Section 5. The output from each aerosol fate and transport model was in turn used as input into epidemiological modeling, which is described in Section 6. For each unique possible aerosol loss- of-containment outcome and for each unique Q value associated with each aerosol loss of containment, an estimate of the conditional probability that the release will result in an infection, or P i, is output from the epidemiological modeling. The three Pi values for each event associated with the low, medium, and high Q values for that event are PiL, PiM, and PiH, respectively. In addition, for each event that resulted in a nonzero probability of an infection, the epidemiological modeling also resulted in a set of potential infection scenarios that served as input for the economic modeling, which is described in Section 7. In turn, three sets of economic output were generated for each event one set corresponding to the 5 th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of outbreak scenarios. For each event, the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of possible economic outcomes were provided in the economic modeling output. These percentiles were used to assign weights to each potential economic outcome, and thereby compute C event . For example, for the 5th and 95th percentiles of economic and outcomes associated with the 5th and 95th percentile outbreaks, weights of 2.5 \u00d7 10-3 were assigned (0.05 times 0.05); for the 50th percentile of economic outcomes associated with the 5th and 95th percentile outbreaks, weights of 4.5 \u00d7 10-2 were assigned (0.9 times 0.05). Similarly, for the 5th and 95th percentiles of economic outcomes associated with the 50th percentile outbreak, weights of 4.5 \u00d7 10-3 were assigned and for the 50th percentile of economic outcomes associated with the 50th percentile outbreak, a weight of 8.1 \u00d7 10-1 was assigned. For three of the four aerosol fault trees considered (i.e., all but the non-containment area fault tree), only one specific case yielded a nonzero Pi value. Specifically, for all rooms within containment, only a complete HEPA failure would result in a possible infection, and then only if the highest Q term modeled were present when the failure occurred. Because the probability of a complete HEPA failure in any of the rooms is less than 1 \u00d7 10-30, an infection due to a complete HEPA failure from a room within containment (given the fully redundant in-series HEPA filtration caisson designed for the NBAF), no subsequent economic modeling or risk calculations were performed for these events. A detailed discussion of the basis for the HEPA failure calculations is provided in Section 4.2.1. The epidemiological output for the HEPA failure events is described in Section 6.2.3. 582 Table 8.1.2 -1: BSL -3Ag AHR Aerosol Event Tree (AA) - Risk Calculations Probability that the Economic Loss Occurs and Results Frequency of an Consequence of an - in an Infection Event Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Risk ($M) Calculations Probability that a Loss Occurs and Frequency of an Economic Results in and Infection Consequence of an All - Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Tree Risk ($M) Events Ptree 8.15E 8.15E -16 Not Included No Credible Events Updated SSRA The detailed input parameters for each of the four aerosol event trees are presented in Appendix A8 (Risk Calculation Supporting Material), along with the results of the event-specific and event-tree\u00ad specific risk calculations. A summary of the resulting risk values are presented in Tables 8.1.2-1 through 8.1.2-4. 583 Table 8.1.2 -2: Necropsy Suite Aerosol Event Tree (NA) - Risk Calculations Probability that the Loss Occurs and Economic Event Results in an Frequency of an Consequence of an - Infection Event Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Risk that a Loss Occurs and Frequ ency of an Economic Results in and Infection Consequence of an All - Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Tree Risk ($M) Events 2.11E 2.11E -20 Not Included 8.1.2 Event Tree (EA) - Risk Calculations Probability that the Loss Occurs and Economic Event Results in an Frequency of an Consequence of an - Infection Event Infection Event (yr 1) Infect ion ($M) Event Risk Calculations Probability that a Loss Occurs and Frequency of an Economic Results in and Infection Consequence of an All - Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Tree Ris k ($M) Events 5.25E 1.17E -18 Not Included No Credible Events Updated SSRA 585 Table 8.1.2 -4: Non -Containment Aerosol Event Tree (OA) - Risk Calculations Probability that the Loss Occurs and Economic Event Results in an Frequency of an Consequence of an - Infection Event Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Risk Ca lculations Probability that a Loss Occurs and Frequency of an Economic Results in and Infection Consequence of an All - Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Tree Risk ($M) Events Waste Events Four solid waste fault trees are presented in Section 4.5: one associated with the BSL-3Ag AHRs; two associated with the BSL-3Ag necropsy suite; and one associated with BSL-3E/ BSL-3E SP rooms. For each room type, one fault tree enumerates a series of potential autoclave and/or incinerator failures and models the probability associated with each potential series of failures and the resulting potential release amounts ( Q values). In addition, for the necropsy suite, there is an additional fault tree associated with carcass and tissue disposal outcomes. For each solid waste loss- of-containment outcome, the low, medium, and hi gh Q terms presented in Section 4.5 served as input into fate and transport calculations, which were used to determine the probability of two potential infection scenarios: (1) an infection occurring at a facility located between the NBAF and the Riley County Transfer Station, or (2) an infection occurring at a facility between the transfer station and the landfill (Hamm Quarry). Epidemiological models and subsequent economic models were run for each of these two potential starting locations (referred to as Site 1 and Site 2). These models resulted in the following parameters, which served as input into the risk calculations: P iL, PiM, and PiH for Site 1, and PiL, PiM, and PiH for Site 2 (where the L, M, and H values below correspond to the QL, QM, and QH values respectively). 586 Updated SSRA In order to generate a single probability of infection value for each outcome, the following equations were applied: Three sets of economic output values were generated for each site one set corresponding to the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of outbreak scenarios. In turn, for each site and outbreak scenario, the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of possible economic outcomes were provided in the economic modeling output. These percentiles were used to assign weights to each of the nine modeled economic outcomes for each site, and thereby compute CSiteK and for each site. The same weighting approach as was applied to aerosol events was applied to solid waste events (see Section 8.1.2). The overall estimate of the economic consequence for a given solid waste event was computed based on the probability that each site would be affected, relative to Pi (which is the probability that an infection would begin at either site). For the potential outcome where an infection begins at both sites, the higher of the two economic consequence values (i.e., those associated with Site 2) was assumed. The following equations were applied: The detailed input parameters and the results for the calculations described above are presented in Appendix A8, along with the results of the event-specific and event-tree-specific risk calculations. A summary of the resulting risk values are presented in Tables 8.1.3-1 through 8.1.3-4. For all solid waste event trees considered in this Updated SSRA, the expected frequency of a loss that leads to an infection is less than 5 \u00d7 10-9. If an infection due to a solid waste release were to occur, the expected economic consequence would be approximately $25B. The risk (computed as the expected frequency of a loss leading to an infection times the consequence of an infection) is less than $0.01M for all solid waste event trees. 587 Table 8.1.3 -1: BSL -3Ag AHR Solid Waste Event Tree (AS) - Risk Calculations Probability that the Loss Occurs and Economic Event Results in an Frequency of an Consequence of an - Infection Event Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Risk Risk Calculatio ns Probability that a Loss Occurs and Frequency of an Economic All Results in and Infection Consequence of an - Events Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Tree Risk ($M) aste Event Tree ( NSW) - Risk Calculations Probability that the Loss Occurs and Economic Event NSW1 NSW2 NSW3 NSW4 NSW5 NSW6 All Events Result s in an Freq uency of an Consequence of an - Infection Event Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Probability that a Loss Occurs and Freq uency of an Economic Result s in and Infection Consequence of an - Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Solid Waste (Carcasses/Tissues) Event Tree (NST) - Risk Calculations Probability that the Loss Occurs and Economic Event Results in an Frequency of an Consequence of an - Infection Event Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Risk Risk Calculations Probability that a Loss Occurs and Frequency of an Economic All Results in and Infection Consequence of an - Events Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Tree Risk ($M) Solid Waste Event Tree (ES) - Risk Calculations Probability that the Loss Occurs and Economic Event ES1 ES2 ES3 ES4 ES5 ES6 All Events Results in an Frequency of an Consequence of an - Infection Event Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) <$0.01 Aggregate Risk Calculations Probability that a Loss Occurs and Frequency of an Economic Results in and Infection Consequence of an - Infec tion Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Tree 8.1.4 Liquid Waste Events Three liquid waste fault trees are presented in Section 4.5: one associated with the BSL-3Ag AHRs, one associated with the BSL-3Ag necropsy suites, and one associated with BSL-3E/ BSL-3E SP rooms. For each room type, the fault tree enumerates a series of potential disinfection and/or cook tank failures and models the probability associated with each potential series of failures and the resulting potential release amounts ( Q values). For each liquid waste loss- of-containment outcome, the low, medium, and high Q terms presented in Section 4.5 served as input into fate and transport calculations, which were used to determine the probability of four potential infection scenarios: 1) an infection occurring at a susceptible premises near \u0011! D ! tible premises near \u0011 \u0012 occurring at a facility near the Big Blue River (Premises D). Epidemiological models and subsequent economic models were run for each of these four potential starting locations (referred to as Premises A through D). These models resulted in the following parameters, which served as input into the risk calculations: P iL, PiM, and PiH for Premises A through D (where the L, M, and H values below correspond to the QL, QM, and QH values respectively). In order to generate a single probability of infection value for each outcome, the following equations were applied: Three sets of economic output values were also generated for each premises one set corresponding to the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of outbreak scenarios. In turn, for each premises and outbreak scenario, the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of possible economic outcomes were provided in the economic modeling output. These percentiles were used to assign weights to each of the nine modeled economic outcomes for each site, and thereby compute CPremisesK and for each site. The same weighting approach as was applied to aerosol and solid waste events was applied to liquid waste events (see Section 8.1.2 for details). 590 Table 8.1.4 -1: BSL -3Ag AHR Liquid Waste Event Tree (AL) - Risk Calculations Probability that the Loss Economic Event Occurs and Results in an Frequency of an Consequence of an - Infection Event Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ( $M) Event Risk Calculations Probability that a Loss Occurs and Frequency of an Economic All Results in and Infection Consequence of an - Events Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Tree Risk ($M) overall estimate of the economic consequence for a given liquid waste event was computed based on the probability that each premises would be affected, relative to Pi (which is the probability that an infection would begin at any premises). For the potential outcome where an infection begins at multiple premises, the highest economic consequence value was assumed. Equations similar to those shown in 8.1.3 were applied to obtain and . The detailed input parameters and the results for the calculations described above are presented in Appendix A8, along with the results of the event-specific and fault-tree-specific risk calculations. A summary of the resulting risk values are presented in Tables 8.1.4-1 through 8.1.4-3. For the liquid waste event trees considered in this Updated SSRA, the expected frequency of a loss that leads to an infection is less than 1 x 10 -7 in all locations. If an infection due to a liquid waste release were to occur, the expected economic consequence would be approximately $108B. The risk (computed as the expected frequency of a liquid loss leading to an infection times the consequence of an infection) is less than or equal to $0.01M for all locations. 591 Table 8.1.4 -2: Necropsy Suite Liquid Waste Event Tree (NL) - Risk Calculations Probability that the Loss Occurs and Economic Event Results in an Frequency of an Consequence of an - Infection Event Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Risk Risk Calculations Probability that a Loss Occurs and Frequency of an Economic All Results in and Infection Consequence of an - Events Infection Event (y r 1) Infection ($M) Event Tree Risk BSL -3E SP Liquid Waste Event Tree (EL) - Risk Calculations Probability that the Loss Occurs and Economic Event Results in an Frequency of an Consequence of an - Infection Event Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Risk Risk Calculations Probability that a Loss Occurs and Frequency of an Economic Results in and Infection Consequence of an All - Infection Event (yr 1) Infection ($M) Event Tree Risk ($M) Events Transference Thirteen transference fault trees are presented in Section 4.5: Two transference fault trees are associated with the BSL-3Ag AHRs (one corresponding to respiratory transfer events and one to fomite transfer events); Three transference fault trees are associated with the BSL-3Ag necropsy suites (two corresponding to hand transference and one corresponding to transference on the body); Three transference fault trees are associated with the BSL-3E/BSL-3E SP rooms (two corresponding to hand transference and one corresponding to transference on the body); and Five transference fault trees are associated with non-containment areas (one each corresponding to hand, foot, and body transference from a spill outside of containment, as well as fomite and palm transference from contact with a leaking drain pipe below an AHR). Each fault tree enumerates a series of potential hygiene or equipment failures resulting in an event in which material is carried from the NBAF and could potentially be transferred to susceptible species. 593 Updated SSRA Each fault tree models the probability associated with each potential series of failures and the resulting potential amounts of material involved in the event ( Q values). For each individual transference event, the low, medium, and high Q terms presented in Section 4.5 served as input into Monte Carlo simulations, which are described in detail in Section 5 and were used to determine the probability of an infection. Outputs from the Monte Carlo simulations were used as input into epidemiological models and subsequent economic models. The results of the Monte Carlo and subsequent epidemiological and economic modeling include three Pi values for each event (associated with the low, medium, and high Q terms for that event, labeled PiL, PiM, and PiH, respectively). For all transference events, a single set of epidemiological models were run (i.e., the modeling assumed that an infection had begun due to transference; the specific mechanism by which the transference had occurred did not affect the models). The epidemiological modeling generated 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile transference outbreak scenarios, which then served as input into economic modeling. For each of the three outbreak scenarios, the economic modeling generated estimates of the 5 th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of possible economic outcomes. These percentiles were used to assign weights to each potential economic outcome, and thereby compute Cevent . The same weighting approach as and was applied to aerosol events was applied to transference events (see Section 8.1.2 for details). The detailed input parameters for each of the transference event trees are presented in Appendix A8, along with the results of the event-specific and event-tree-specific risk calculations. A summary of the resulting risk values are presented in Tables 8.1.5-1 through 8.1.5-12. For all transference event trees considered in this Updated SSRA, the expected frequency of a loss that leads to an infection is approximately 1 \u00d7 10-6. If an infection due to transference were to occur, the expected economic consequence would be approximately $82B. The risk (computed as the expected frequency of a liquid loss leading to an infection times the consequence of an infection) is less than or equal to $0.05M for all transference events. 594 Table 8.1.5 -1: BSL -3Ag AHR Respiratory Transference Event Tree (ATR) -

Detailed discussions related to these two catastrophic events are provided in Section 4. For each of these two events, the analysis presented in Section 4 resulted in estimated probabilities of occurrence and potential release amounts ( Q values). For tornados, two scenarios were carried through fate and transport, epidemiological, and economic modeling (specifically, both a 108 and a 1010 release were modeled). As presented in Section 4, the potential release amounts ( Q values) associated with a tornado event are on the order of 106 (for the 5th and 50th percentile values) and 1010 (for the 95th percentile value). For purposes of risk calculations, the Pi values and consequence estimates associated with the 108 models were, conservatively, given 95% weights and the Pi values and consequence estimates associated with the 1010 models were given 5% weights. Specifically, for tornados, Pi was computed as . Similarly, two sets of economic outputs were combined by assigning an additional weighting factor to the output values of 0.95 for the output values associated with the 10 8 model and 0.05 for the output values associated with the 1010 model. For earthquakes, 104, 105, and 108 releases were included in the fate and transport and epidemiological modeling. However, because the 104 and 105 releases resulted in no probability of infection, only the 108 release was included in subsequent economic modeling. As presented in Section 4, the potential release amounts ( Q values) associated with an earthquake event are on the order of 104 (for the 5th percentile value), 105 (for the 50th percentile value), and 108 (for the 95th percentile value). For purposes of risk calculations for earthquakes, the Pi values and consequence estimates were weighted as follows. Pi was computed as . The input parameters and the results for the calculations described above are presented in Appendix A8. A summary of the resulting risk values are presented in Tables 8.1.6-1. 606 Updated SSRA 8.2 Risk Rankings for FMDv-Related Events In total, twenty-six event trees (including the two catastrophic events) comprising a total of 144 events were evaluated. This section presents a comparative analysis and interpretation of the risks across the event trees and individual events comprising each tree that were considered in this Updated SSRA. Twenty-one of the twenty-six risk trees were found to have an observable risk. Figure 8.2-1 shows the fault-tree frequencies and consequences for each of the fault trees. Note that in this figure, the frequencies and consequences are aggregated for each event tree. Individual events are not shown. Figure 8.2-1: Frequency-Consequence Plot for All Event Trees Table 8.2-1 presents the risks for all trees with an observed risk (i.e., the expected frequency of a release resulting in an infection times the estimated consequence if a release resulting in an infection occurs). 607 Table 8.2 -1: Risk Values by Event Tree FTree : Frequency of Loss CTree : Economic Consequence, Risk Tree: Economic Risk Leading to an Infection Conditional on an In fection Associated with the Event - (yr 1) Occurring ($M) Tree ($M) Tree Name Expected Expected - FTree Expected CTree - CTree - Risk Figure 8.2-2 graphically presents the expected risk values from Table 8.2-1. In this figure, events are organized by event tree, and the height of each bar represents the total risk for each event tree. Whiskers extending above each bar represent the estimated risk plus the associated uncertainty (standard deviation). Bars are sub-divided to show the contribution of each individual event to the total risk for each tree; individual events within each tree are ordered from bottom to top in order of the smallest risk contributors to the largest risk contributors. Because the y-axis is logarithmic, the relative contribution of each event is not necessarily proportional to the relative area represented on the bar for that event. 608 Updated SSRA 609 Figure 8.2-2: Aggregate Risk by Event Tree Updated SSRA A total of seventy-seven (77) individual FMDv events assessed resulted in a nonzero estimate of expected risk. Of these 77 events, two occurred along the aerosol pathway (with the loss originating outside containment), 11 occurred along the solid waste pathway, 11 occurred along the liquid waste pathway, 51 occurred along the transference pathway, and two were due to catastrophic events. In all cases, the estimated risk was found to be less than $1M, with the catastrophic earthquake posing the highest risk (approximately $0.6M). The transference events represent the greatest fraction of all events resulting in expected risk; however, in all cases, the transference event risks (aggregated across all events within a given tree) are less than $0.05M. A more detailed discussion of the risks, organized by pathway, is presented below. 8.2.1 Aerosol Pathway Virtually no risk was observed from the aerosol pathway when the event originated within containment. A total of 32 aerosol release events originating from NBAF BSL-3Ag containment (AHRs, necropsy suites or BSL-3E/BSL-3E SP rooms) were evaluated; none resulted in credible risk. Specifically, the probability of an aerosol loss occurring from any one of the BSL-3Ag rooms and resulting in an infection approaches zero ( 4.70 \u00d7 10 -36). As a point of reference, this is less than the probability of the decay of a single proton in a vacuum (10-32), an asteroid impacting the earth (10-6), or suffering a fatal air travel accident (10-5)2. This finding is also consistent with the ABSL-4 Assessment, which indicated no credible risk from the aerosol pathway when the release originated within ABSL-4 containment. This suggests that the 65% NBAF Design, which has been upgraded to include fully redundant in-series HEPA filtration, sufficiently mitigates the risk of release of infectious material via the aerosol pathway . The only aerosol events that resulted in observable risk (events OA2 and OA3 within event tree OA) were those that originated outside of containment, for which building engineering controls such as HEPA filtration are not involved. In these events, a release could occur due to a failure of the primary and secondary containers of a package containing viable FMDv being received by the NBAF. If both the primary and secondary containers failed, a fraction of the sample would be aerosolized. Because this type of release was modeled as occurring outside of the NBAF building (between the Transshipping Facility and the Laboratory Building), it had a significant impact relative to some of the other modeled events. Although the overall expected risk of the transshipping error events is relatively low (less than $0.02M), the consequence of one of these events (conditional on their occurrence) are among the highest consequence events ($108B). 8.2.2 Liquid Pathway All of the liquid waste event trees (EL) resulted in estimated risk of $0.01M or less. Within each area, the specific events that correspond to nonzero (but low) risk are events associated with cook tank failures. No risk was observed in any location when the cook tank was functional, regardless of whether there 2 Sources of probability statistics info; National Center for Health Statistics, CDC; American Cancer Society; National Safety Council; International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; World Health Organization; USGS; Clark Chapman, SwRI 610 Updated SSRA were failures in any other node of the effluent decontamination system (drain priming or waste pre\u00ad treatment). Multiple process alarms are in place to provide indication to the control system and operators if any anomaly in the cook tank performance is detected. The NBAF engineering control practice of including an independent and redundant verification indicator of cook tank performance prior to releasing liquid waste from the NBAF significantly reduced the risk along this release pathway. As a result, a cook tank failure and the subsequent failure to recognize a cook tank failure (and thus release FMDv material) is expected to be a very rare event. However, if a cook tank failure were to occur, the consequence of the failure would be significant (approximately $108B). Although the overall risk is low based on the low expected frequency of a loss, the estimated economic consequence values underscore the criticality of the function of the cook tanks in all areas to preventing the release of contaminated liquid waste. 8.2.3 Solid Waste Pathway Risks associated with solid waste pathways are very low in all cases, with solid waste aggregate risk values (summed across all events within a given solid waste tree) falling between $3.8 \u00d7 10 -10 and $8.2 \u00d7 10-5. These low risk values, as compared to other event trees considered in the Updated SSRA, reflect low probabilities of releases leading to infections. These low probabilities are the result of the efficacy of redundant and independent solid waste decontamination systems planned for the NBAF. In addition, the estimated economic consequences associated with solid waste infections (if one were to occur), were found to be low relative to the consequences observed for other events. Specifically, the estimated economic consequence if an infection were to occur due to a solid waste release were found to be generally between $24B and $28B (compared to consequences over $100B for other pathways). The addition of redundant and independent solid waste decontamination systems in the 65% Design, including the addition of on-site incineration, has mitigated the risks of release of infectious material via the solid waste pathway from the NBAF. 8.2.4 Catastrophic Events The event with the highest risk value was the catastrophic earthquake event, for which a risk of $0.56M was observed, which is driven by the return period of an earthquake event that may cause sufficient damage to the NBAF that would result in a loss of containment. The observed risk associated with a catastrophic tornado event was less than $0.01M (approximately $0.002M), since the return period of a tornado with winds in excess of 228 mph is so long. Thus, it can be concluded that the tornado hardening improvements implemented since the 2010 SSRA was released have greatly reduced the risk associated with a tornado event at the NBAF. If either of the catastrophic events (earthquakes or tornados) were to occur, the estimated economic impact is approximately $28B to $30B, which is somewhat lower than the estimated consequences associated with other events (transference, liquid waste, and aerosol events in particular). 611 Updated SSRA 8.2.5 Transference Events Interestingly, none of the individual transference events resulted in an expected risk greater than $0.04M but they were among the most numerous events resulting in nonzero risks (representing 51 of the 77 or 66% of the risk-generating events). The most significant transference events are those that occurred with the greatest event frequency as all the transference events, if they lead to any probability of infection, resulted in the same overall expected economic impact of approximately $82B. Even though the economic impact was significant (and greater than the solid waste events described previously), the frequency of an infection due to a transference event was estimated to be less than once in 2 million years ( FEven t = 5.33 \u00d7 10-7) for each of the transference event trees considered, resulting in overall risk values of less than $0.05M. The events that occurred most frequently and thus occupied the greatest transference risk space either occurred outside of containment (OT event trees) or were due to a full disregard of procedures and a resultant fomite transfer (a single event ATF3). If an initiating event were to occur outside of containment (event trees OTB, OTP, OTF), engineering/operation controls in place within the containment block would not be available to reduce the amount of virus that is released to the environment. In these outside containment events, workers in-processing/handling containers of viable FMDv that have been shipped with failed primary and secondary containers or those cleaning up a spill associated with the failed containers would be exposed to FMDv on the hand, footwear or other parts of the body. The only mitigation nodes that are assumed to reduce the source term are gloves, Tyvek\u00ae (or equivalent) suit, removal/containment of contaminated footwear, and/or a body shower (event dependent). If a failure of the primary and secondary packages were to occur, even if the exposure were recognized, the mitigations modeled for non-containment were not assumed to always be sufficient to eliminate all of the associated risk as evident in risks observed with OTB2, OTF2, OTP2, OTB4 and OTP4. As in the non-containment events, the fomite transference event ATF3, occurred at a relatively high frequency compared to the other transference events (roughly an order of magnitude or more) and therefore carried slightly greater risk. This event was due to failure to follow established practices and procedures (similar to nearly all of the transference events that occurred within containment that resulted in observable risk). The vast majority of the risk observed with the transference events therefore can be attributed to human error. As concluded in the 2010 SSRA, training and a safety- oriented culture are key to reducing accidents from transference events. 8.3 Cumulative Risk Calculations The discussion in Section 8.2 focuses on the comparison of risks across the various FMDv loss- of\u00ad containment events considered in this Updated SSRA. This type of events-based evaluation and comparison of risks allows decision-makers to quantitatively evaluate the NBAF facility design, procedures, and policies to make informed decisions and prioritize investments as the NBAF implementation effort progresses. In addition to the comparative risk analysis shown above, feedback 612 Updated SSRA from the NAS SSRA Committee (and subsequently in public law) stated that the Updated SSRA should also present cumulative probability and risk values across events and over the 50-year anticipated operating lifetime of the NBAF. Accordingly, this section presents cumulative risk estimates for the NBAF. Several caveats are critical to consider in the interpretation of the cumulative risk values. First, the uncertainty associated with the estimates comprising the cumulative risk values is, in many cases, large relative to the estimated risks. One implication of this uncertainty is that the cumulative calculations shown in this section are also highly uncertain. In addition, due to the lack of information about the potential changes in accident frequencies, research priorities, and economic consequences over time, cumulative risk calculations are based on an assumption of static risk over the anticipated 50-year operating lifetime of the NBAF. This assumption is almost certainly not valid, but any assumed changes over time would be equally fraught with uncertainty and therefore were not incorporated into this evaluation. Additionally, the economic consequences are presented in present-day dollar amounts and do not account for interest or inflation. As a result, while the risk calculations provide useful information for ranking risks, identifying vulnerabilities, prioritizing investments, and planning response, care should be taken to avoid over-interpreting the cumulative risk estimate as an absolute number. Cumulative risks summed over all events (for a single year) are presented in Section 8.3.1, and cumulative risks, summed over the 50-year operating lifetime of the NBAF, are presented in Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1 Cumulative Risks Across Events The probability, across all event trees, of one or more events in a given year that results in an infection is denoted as P 1Y and is computed as follows: The cumulative risk, summed across all fault trees, is denoted as Risk 1Y and is computed as follows: Calculations were performed with all events, and using only non-catastrophic events (i.e., tornados and earthquakes excluded). Table 8.3.1-1 summarizes the results of these calculations. 613 Table 8.3.1 -1: Cumulative Risks Across Events (for One Year) P1Y Risk 1Y Probability of one or more loss of-containment ou tcomes that Cumulative risk over all event, results in an infection for one year All Events 2.16 \u00d7 10-5 $0.7M Non Updated SSRA \u00ad Uncertainty in the probability calculations was estimated as follows: 1. A low-end estimate for was computed by first setting Pi for each event equal to PiL for that event (recall that PiL is the probability of infection associated with the 5th percentile of possible Q values associated with a given loss- of-containment outcome). Subsequent Pevent and Ptree calculations were performed using these low-end estimates of Pi.. The low-end estimate Ptree for each tree was then used in the calculations shown above. 2. A high-end estimate for was computed by first setting Pi for each event equal to PiH for that event (recall that PiH is the probability of infection associated with the 5th percentile of possible Q values associated with a given loss- of-containment outcome). Subsequent Pevent and Ptree calculations were then performed using these high-end estimates of Pi.. The high-end estimate Ptree for each tree was then used in the calculations shown above. These calculations resulted in probability estimates ranging from 3.07 \u00d7 10-11 to 4.23 \u00d7 10-4 when all events are and from 3.07 \u00d7 10-11 to 2.33 \u00d7 10-5 when catastrophic events are excluded. In other words, when all events are considered, the probability of at least one release resulting in an infection in a given year is estimated to range between approximately 3.1 \u00d7 10-9 % and 0.04%. When catastrophic events are excluded, the probability of at least one release resulting in an infection in a given year is estimated to range between 3.1 \u00d7 10-9 % and 0.002%. The uncertainty (standard deviation) in the one-year risk was computed as the square root of the sum of the tree-specific estimated variances. The resulting standard deviation in the risk value is approximately $306M when catastrophic events are included and $304M when catastrophic events are excluded. 8.3.2 Cumulative Risks Across Time In addition to computing the cumulative risk across all events for a single year, the cumulative risks over the 50-year operating lifetime of the NBAF were considered. 614 Table 8. 3.2-1: Cumulative Risks Across Events for the 50 -Year Operating Lifetime of the NBAF P50Y Risk 50Y Probability of one or more loss - Cumulative risk over events, of-containment outcomes that over 50 -year operating results in an infection lifetime of the NBA F All Events 1.08 \u00d7 10-3 $35M Non -Catastrophic Events Only 7.61 \u00d7 10-5 $7M Updated SSRA The equation for computing the probability of at least one event that results in an infection over the 50\u00ad year operating lifetime of the NBAF is: The cumulative risk, summed across the 50-year operating lifetime is denoted as Risk 50Y and is computed as follows: The results are summarized in Table 8.3.2- 1. Figures 8.3.2-1 and 8.3.2-2 present the cumulative calculations graphically. Figure 8.3.2-1 shows the cum ulative probabilities over time, and Figure 8.3.2-2 shows the cumulative risks over time. 615 Updated SSRA Figure 8.3.2-1: Cumulative Probability of an Infection Over the 50-Year NBAF Operating Lifetime Figure 8.3.2-2: Cumulative Risk ($M) Over 50-Year NBAF Operating Lifetime 616 Updated SSRA Uncertainty in the 50-year probability and risk calculations was estimated using the same procedures as described above for the one-year probability and risk values. The calculations resulted in 50-year cumulative probability estimates ranging from 1.54 \u00d7 10-9 to 2.09 \u00d7 10-2 when all events are included, and from 1.54 \u00d7 10-9 to 1.17 \u00d7 10-3 when catastrophic events are excluded. In other words, when all events are considered, the probability of at least one release resulting in an infection over the 50-year NBAF operating lifetime is estimated to range between approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10-7 % and 2.1%. When catastrophic events are excluded, the probability of at least one release resulting in an infection over the 50-year NBAF operating lifetime is estimated to range between 1.5 \u00d7 10-7% and 0.1%. The uncertainty (standard deviation) in the 50-year cumulative risk was found to be approximately $15B, regardless of whether catastrophic events are included. In summary, with the caveat that care should be taken to avoid interpreting the cumulative calculations as absolute values, the estimated probability that an accidental release of FMDv from the NBAF will \u0011! -year operating life is 0.11%, which reflects updated design, operations, and accident response strategies that have been implemented since the 2010 SSRA. 617 Updated SSRA 618 Updated SSRA 9. Large Animal BSL-4 Assessment Abstract: This Large Animal BSL-4 (ABSL-4) Assessment relied on a panel of international containment subject matter experts (SMEs), members of the NBAF Design Partnership (NDP), and risk assessment professionals to develop and analyze a set of events that represent the state- of-the-practice risks associated with handling (infected) large animals within BSL-4 containment. A total of 109 events that span potential loss of containment across four release pathways - aerosol, liquid waste, solid waste, and transference - are described. For each of the events, a quantitative fault tree analysis was performed from which the associated event frequency and event impact (based on historical Nipah and Hendra case studies) were calculated and used to determine an estimated risk for each event. In this assessment, the greatest risk was identified along the transference pathway, which relies less on design elements and more on trained, compliant staff adhering to well defined plans, practices, and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Through this assessment, with the exception of a few of improbable solid waste and aerosol pathway events (that occur with frequencies of less than once every 10 million years), it appears that the NBAF 65% Design elements mitigate the risk of Nipah virus (NiV) or Hendra virus (HeV) release along the aerosol, solid waste, and liquid waste pathways from ABSL-4 containment. Furthermore, the vast majority of the risk observed in this ABSL-4 assessment could be attributed in some way to human error. This observation highlights the importance for the NBAF (as it nears operation over the next eight years) to develop SOPs, plans, and practices with continued periodic training of staff to assess their continued compliance. The observable risk also indicates that proper training of staff (e.g., biosafety, biosecurity, biocontainment, security, etc.) through continuing education and refresher training to ensure the understanding and compliance with SOPs, plans, and practices, will reduce the potential for the human errors attributed to the transference events. 9.1 Introduction The use of best practices and experience-based knowledge compiled from the design, construction, and operation of animal pathogen and human pathogen facilities greatly reduces the NBAF-related risk to U.S. citizens and agricultural infrastructure. However, it is impossible to eliminate all of the risk associated with high-consequence pathogen research. It is also impossible to identify and model every possible accident condition, but it is feasible to use accident event modeling to assist decision-makers and designers. The primary overall objective of the Updated SSRA is to assess the risks associated with the current NBAF design (65% Design) that incorporate changes made since the 15% Design was used in the 2010 SSRA. The assessment of these risks will be used to inform DHS so additional changes can be made, if necessary, to the facility design, operational strategy plans, or response mitigation planning processes while there is still time to address these issues. This updated assessment is intended to help prioritize resource allocations to develop policies and procedures that will allow DHS to build and operate a model containment laboratory facility. 619 Updated SSRA The primary objective of the ABSL-4 Assessment within the Updated SSRA is to identify and categorize the unique risks associated with working with large animals exposed to pathogens studied in BSL- 4 containment. With these unique risks identified, this effort served to reveal potential gaps in the current NBAF plans relevant to research in BSL-4 containment with large animals and identify and suggest alternate design, operations, and or response strategies that have proven effective at other laboratories and that could be leveraged for use at the NBAF to reduce the risk of BSL-4 pathogen exposures within or from the NBAF. A sub-objective of this effort was to update pathogen characteristic information that was presented in the 2010 QRA for NiV and HeV related to the pathogen etiology, host range, epidemiology, immune response, laboratory requirements, and anticipated research needs. NiV and HeV pathogen updates were included in this quantitative modeling effort and may continue to support future assessments and/or development and validation of models relevant to BSL-4 pathogens. Furthermore, the ABSL-4 element of this 2012 Updated SSRA directly addresses NAS SSRA Committee finding 11 which states: \"The SSRA's qual itative risk assessment of work with BSL-4 pathogens in large animals was inadequate. The committee does not concur with the SSRA's finding that its quantitative risk assessment regarding FMDv and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFv) sufficiently represents the range of risk regarding the other pathogens that will be studied at the NBAF, that is, the pathogens that are included in the qualitative risk assessment. The committee does not agree that the BSL-3 quantitative risk assessment adequately frames the risks associated with operating a BSL-4 large animal facility, because it is insufficient to use BSL-3 pathogens to predict risks associated with BSL-4 pathogens that are zoonotic and for which no treatment is available .\" Finally, this effort will fulfill the goals and objectives of the FY2011 continuing resolution language (SEC. 1647. (a) Section 560 of Public Law 111 the revised site-specific biosafety and biosecurity mitigation risk assessment required by subsection (b) shall/ include overall risks of the most dangerous pathogens the Department of Homeland Security expects to hold in the National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility's biosafety level 4 facility, and effectiveness of mitigation strategies to reduce those risks This effort represents a significant change from the previous 2010 SSRA, which performed a purely qualitative assessment of the eight primary research pathogens to be studied at the NBAF. In this iteration, a complete event-driven evaluation of ABSL-4 (NiV and HeV) risk was completed. This effort was informed and supported by the enhanced fidelity of BSL-4 design data from the 65% Design; additional detail on proposed NBAF BSL-4 containment practices; BSL-4 systems performance, including failure nodes and probabilities across all four release pathway associated systems; published data regarding the amount of NiV and HeV typically observed during ABSL-4 activities; prevalence and proximity of susceptible species/reservoir hosts surrounding the NBAF; and a historical review of NiV and HeV case studies to inform impact metrics integral to the estimation of the associated ABSL-4 risk. 620 Updated SSRA It is important to stress that the risks resulting from this ABSL-4 assessment represent estimated risk and should not be mistaken for absolute risk. At this stage in the NBAF development, and with the maturity of available data for NiV and HeV disease research, a risk ranking is appropriate and offers a means by which to identify areas of focus for DHS in regards to additional operational, design, or mitigation strategies that should be considered before going operational in 2020. The event fault analyses alone, which estimate the frequency of accidental releases for each event but are not highly dependent on any particular pathogen, provide valuable information. Understanding the failures that can lead to a release are as critical, if not more so, than estimating the impact in regards to the identification of relevant strategies to prevent their occurrence. The impact analyses, although based on historical data, come with a level of uncertainty given the outbreaks reported have occurred in nations with grossly different farming and medical practices than what exists at and around the NBAF. Furthermore, there are noted uncertainties in several components evaluated in the impact and risk determinations namely the probability of infection of NiV and HeV given an exposure, the infectious dose in human or large animal models, and the amount and transmissibility of virus shed by infected animals. However, even with these uncertainties, the impact analyses performed do provide a means of ranking the estimated risk of the ABSL-4 events such that DHS can begin prioritizing efforts on the events that exhibit the most significant risk and/or occur with the greatest frequency, understanding that this body of work is limited to the current state of available information. Clearly, as more data become available for NiV, HeV, or emerging pathogens, the values presented in this body of work and the resulting conclusions and recommendations should be re-evaluated for relevance. 9.2 ABSL-4 Assessment Approach The ABSL-4 assessment was performed following the same general process as previously described for the quantitative FMDv risk assessment. The ABSL-4 assessment included event development, event (fault tree) analysis, including development of associated error probabilities and event frequencies, event impact estimation and determination of risk. The ABSL-4 assessment made use of conceptual models of the ABSL-4 originating locations, the previously described transport pathways (Section 4), published and available virus and disease characteristics, forecasted research activity, the NBAF laboratory plans (65% Design), presumptive NBAF procedures (based on plans and SOPs from Australian Animal Health Laboratory currently working with HeV infected horses), and other response plans based on best practices and existing DHS directives similar to those described for FMDv. In contrast to the FMDv assessment, however, aerosol fate and transport modeling, epidemiological modeling and economic impact modeling were not performed for the ABSL-4 assessment as the lack of available published/peer-reviewed data and lack of necessary validated models at this stage of NiV and HeV research preclude these types of analyses for these or emerging pathogens. Conversely, the potential impact of a release of NiV or HeV from the NBAF along any one of the four transport pathways was estimated through review and extrapolation from documented NiV and HeV case studies. Following review and evaluation of NiV and HeV outbreaks across the globe; an outbreak impact score was derived for each of the two pathogens and applied to each ABSL-4 event according to defined criteria. The impact score was subsequently factored into the calculation of risk for each event. 621 Updated SSRA The cornerstone to any successful scenario-driven risk assessment is the development of a thorough and representative set of events that encompass the envisioned risks. An event is an accident (loss of containment) that may or may not result in an infection outside of containment (the undesirable outcome). Performance of this critical component of the assessment was done through collaboration and solicitation of world-renowned biocontainment specialists, including representatives from the only facilities in the world currently handling large animals within ABSL-4 containment. The following international panel of BSL-4 containment experts provided invaluable support to the development of the ABSL-4 NBAF assessment specifically in regard to the development of the unique set of events that encompass risks associated with handling large animals within ABSL-4 containment.

Additional detail regarding the process used and assumptions applied during the ABSL- 4 assessment are included throughout the following detailed sections. 9.3 BSL-4 Large Animal Research at the NBAF 9.3.1 Types of Research Proposed Of the current pathogens proposed for study at the NBAF, Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are the only agents that require BSL-4 and ABSL-4 practices and facilities. The general research areas anticipated at the NBAF (as identified by the QRA SME Panel in conjunction with Scientific End-Users in the 2010 SSRA) for NiV and HeV include experimentation regarding vaccine development and efficacy countermeasures; pathogenesis; route of entry and infectious dose; improved diagnostics; development of rapid pen side tests; modes of transmission; identification of natural reservoir(s); susceptibility of North American bats; and drug therapy discovery. Recent progress in vaccine development, post- exposure therapeutics and characterization of NiV and HeV are described below. 9.3.2 Updated Nipah and Hendra Pathogen Characteristics A literature review was performed to present the current state of knowledge regarding NiV and HeV. Although the vast majority of the content presented in the 2010 SSRA remains relevant, several recent vaccine development advances have been made. There are currently no antiviral therapies or vaccines available for treating or preventing NiV or HeV infection [Pallister et al., 2011a; Bossart et al., 2007]. It is unlikely that a live-attenuated virus will be approved due to the BSL-4 containment requirements for NiV and HeV; however vaccine development for the Henipavirus has significantly progressed in the past few years and these advances have recently been reviewed by Pallister et al. [2011a]. In the first successful Henipavirus vaccine experiment, recombinant vaccinia viruses that encode NiV F or G glycoprotein protected against NiV challenge in Syrian (golden) hamsters and provided protection up to five months post-challenge [Guillaume et al., 2004a]. These results suggest that such vaccines can protect against late-onset symptoms. Unfortunately, these vaccines are not viable for human candidates because of risks of vaccinia virus vaccination [Guillaume et al., 2004a]. Another recent study demonstrated that recombinant canarypox virus-based vaccines encoding NiV F or G protected pigs against NiV challenge [Weingartl et al., 2006]. While this vaccine is also not suitable for human study, significant progress has been made towards a veterinary vaccine for NiV [Bossart et al., 2007]. Mungall et al. developed a subunit vaccine comprised of soluble G glycoprotein (sG) from HeV and NiV and evaluated its efficacy in a feline model [2006]. Immunized cats challenged with NiV and HeV did not develop any signs of disease [Mungall et al., 2006]. A similar vaccine formulation was designed by McEachern et al. that contained recombinant, soluble G glycoprotein from HeV and CpG adjuvant was also tested in the feline model [2008]. Vaccinated cats challenged with lethal NiV were protected from disease with the virus detected 21 days post-challenge in a single animal [McEachern et al., 2008] . Recombinant subunit immunogens are a viable and efficient option for vaccines for Henipaviruses as they can be quickly implemented, are simple, and can be administered with no risk of infection [Pallister 623 Updated SSRA et al., 2011a]. Recently, Pallister et al. evaluated a similar vaccine of HeVsG adjuvanted with CpG, which protected ferrets against lethal doses of HeV [Pallister et al., 2011b]. In the last few years, several groups have tested neutralized antibodies for protection against NiV and HeV infection [Bossart et al., 2009, 2011; Defang et al., 2010; al., 2006; al., 2008] . Guillaume et al. utilized monoclonal antibodies to both glycoproteins to protect against NiV in hamsters in which high levels of anti-G MAb and anti-F MAb (112 and 180 \u00b5g, respectively) gave a sterilizing immunity with protection observed at lower levels (1.12 and 1.8 \u00b5g, respectively) [2006]. Work by Defang and colleagues suggested that a vaccine could be developed against HeV and NiV based on HeV immunogens as the F or G glycoprotein of either HeV or NiV can induce cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies [2010]. Similar results were obtained by Zhu et al. using a human monoclonal antibody [2008]. Recently, a neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, m102.4 has been shown to protect against NiV viral doses of 500 TCID 50 applied to ferrets [Bossart et al., 2009]. In this study, m102.4 was administered intravenously to mimic human drug delivery and all animals treated post-NiV-challenge were protected, and one out of three ferrets treated before the NiV challenge survived. Bossart and colleagues have also evaluated m102.4 against HeV challenge in African green monkeys in an attempt to mimic human conditions in regards to the pathogenic process as closely as possible [Bossart et al., 2011]. Fourteen subjects were inoculated via the intra-tracheal route with a lethal dose of HeV. All twelve monkeys that received two 100 mg doses of m102.4 survived infection, whereas all of the untreated control animals succumbed within eight days. Further research is ongoing to develop the safest, most effective vaccination against NiV and HeV. A Henipavirus vaccine must adhere to certain standards in order to be considered for human use. It must be successful in two animal models, a natural route of infection should be used in protection studies, the mechanism and limits of protection should be elicited, and the highest standards should be used for reagent production to assure safety and success in human trials [Bossart et al., 2007] . In addition to vaccine development, post-exposure therapeutics are also being investigated in response to Henipavirus exposure. Several studies have been performed examining the effects of passive therapy on NiV challenge experiments on hamsters [Pallister et al., 2011a; Bossart et al., 2007]. While these trials have been successful, further research is needed before testing these therapeutic measures on humans. In addition to passive therapy, research involving attachment glycoprotein [G], fusion glycoprotein, fusion inhibitors, soluble and polyclonal and human monoclonal envelope-specific antibodies has also advanced in the past few years in relation to prevention and post-exposure Henipavirus therapeutics. These advancements in NiV and HeV vaccine and post-exposure therapeutics are significant and appear to be advancing at a fairly rapid pace in recent years. Careful attention should be paid to monitor the progress of these therapeutics over the next several years as the NBAF response and operation plans are developed as they may significantly impact (presumably reduce) the risks of working with NiV and HeV at the NBAF (or other containment facilities). An update to the available pathogen etiology is provided in Table 9.3.2-1.

Thus, the current DHS and USDA missions do not include research, diagnostic test development and validation, or discovery and development of effective countermeasures for zoonotic diseases of livestock. The NBAF is designed to provide a safe and modern BSL-4 capability that will enable the DHS and USDA programs to perform these necessary research functions. The BSL-4 area will be located in the middle of the containment zone, as indicated in Figure 9.4-1 and described in Section 2.2.1. BSL-3Ag BSL-4 BSL-3E [NDP, 2011] The NBAF BSL- use of containment areas to provide a pressure-controlled buffer. This facility is relatively unique compared to other recent BSL-4 facilities employing this concept in that due to the sheer size of the NBAF, the buffer surrounding the BSL-4 is not a corridor, but the adjacent BSL-3E and BSL-3Ag program space. Deline \u0012 D clothes changing areas are provided (for both genders) and separated by shower facilities. Inside of the containment zone, the BSL-3E and BSL-3Ag are separated and buffere \u0012 corridors. The program space dedicated to each level of containment is listed in Table 9.4- 1. 629 Table 9.4 -1: Gross containment space [NDP 65% Design, 2011] Area facilities will be shared between DHS, USDA ARS, and USDA APHIS. The major functional com ponents of the BSL-4 area include large animal holding rooms, small animal holding rooms, necropsy rooms procedure rooms, laboratory spaces, virus collection, cold room storage, autoclave staging areas, decontaminating showers, and body shower/change areas, as depicted in Figure 9.4- 2. Figure 9.4-2: BSL-4 Facilities 630 Updated SSRA The NBAF Design Partnership developed a process flow illustration for BSL-4 containment that is presented in Figure 9.4-3. This illustration shows the designed movements for personnel, materials, wastes, and large animals. The decontaminating (chemical) showers (locations indicated on Figure 9.4-3) serve as an airlock on personnel entry and a decontaminating shower on personnel exit. Furthermore, the decontaminating shower system is controlled by interlocks which allow only one door at a time to be opened, and upon exit; opening of each door into the subsequent areas requires a complete disinfection cycle to be run. Decontaminating (Chemical) Showers Figure 9.4-3: BSL-4 Facilities Flow The containment systems used in BSL-4 are similar to those described in Section 2 for BSL-3Ag. 9.4.1 ABSL-4 Animal Holding Rooms The ABSL-4 animal holding rooms (AHRs) abut and share the single necropsy room. (Note that for the ABSL-4 assessment, the focus is limited to activities and rooms involving large livestock and therefore all AHRs discussed herein refer to large animal holding.) Surrounding the AHRs are decontaminating showers as described above, and passing out of these rooms into the laboratory area proper requires a decontaminating shower to reduce gross contamination of the suit. Feed storage is also located within the animal area as well as adjacent to the fumigation vestibules. 631 Updated SSRA 632 surrounded by the ABSL-4 AHRs. Necropsy connected to the BSL-4 corridor via a necropsy vestibule and connects to the ABSL-4 AHR via a decontaminating shower, which as for AHRs, all researchers must pass through and complete on entry and exit. Additionally, fumigation vestibules provide for the introduction and removal of equipment and/or animals to the ABSL-4 areas. The necropsy room contains large double door, pass-through autoclaves for removal of solid (red-bagged) waste, as well as two large tissue autoclaves for the removal of animal carcasses and carcass components, as discussed in detail in Section 9.5. Cold storage and two large necropsy tables are also contained within the room to facilitate large animal manipulations. Figure 9.4.2-1: ABSL-4 Large Animal Holding Room and Necropsy Showing Entry Protocol and Relationship of the Two Areas A mirror AHR (not shown) is located on the left side of the necropsy room. Updated SSRA 9.4.3 BSL-4 Laboratory The BSL-4 laboratory is designed to provide researchers space to maintain live virus collections, microbiological equipment, and conduct small animal experiments depending on the defined needs by the scientific research user group. The BSL-4 laboratory is an open plan design that can be reconfigured with casework and scientific equipment based on the specific needs of the research to be conducted within. The dunk tank, autoclave, and fumigation vestibules serving the BSL-4 laboratory are located immediately adjacent to the lab to allow stand-alone functionality as needed. Each BSL-4 suite contains one small animal holding room for studies that utilize small animal models such as rabbits or rodents. An adjacent procedure room may be used for the surgical manipulations or necropsies of these small animals as well. The BSL-4 laboratory is adjacent to the suit change room, and all personnel must pass out of the laboratory into the main suit change room for doffing of the fully encapsulated BSL-4 suit, then into the body shower and into the outer change room to remove and discard the inner laboratory garments, and don the BSL-3E laboratory clothing to pass into the surrounding BSL-3E corridor. (Note that the focus of this assessment remains on the NBAF BSL-4 containment areas where work on large animals will be performed; however, it is important to present the relationship of the large animal BSL- 4 spaces (AHRs and necropsy) to the BSL-4 laboratory as they are adjacent and interconnected, and their personnel share common shower out and change areas within the BSL-4 laboratory.) 9.5 ABSL-4 Release Pathways and Associated Mitigations Pathogen containment is maintained by providing redundant systems and processes that decontaminate and/or sterilize biological materials that leave the containment block. There are four pathways, or transport mechanisms, by which infectious materials might escape the ABSL-4 containment areas: 1. In certain accident events, pathogens such as NiV and HeV in a viable condition may escape containment as an aerosol . Aerosols , including procedure-generated aerosols, animal respiration, and other sources are generally controlled by the use of biosafety cabinets (BSC), special air flow control devices, and high-volume HEPA filtration systems. 2. It is also theoretically possible that NiV and HeV could escape containment in solid waste . Solid wastes and durable equipment (i.e., all materials exiting containment by autoclave, dunk tank, wipe down, or vapor decontamination) are sequentially decontaminated when leaving containment. Generally, all such materials are subjected to at least two or three sterilization or decontamination processes. 3. Other accident sequences can be developed where it is possible that these viruses could escape containment as a liquid waste . Liquids (i.e., all materials discharged into the NBAF liquid effluent treatment system) in containment areas are disinfected by protocol prior to being collected and processed by a liquid Effluent Decontamination System (EDS). 4. The potentially most-elusive mode of containment loss is the transference pathway. Transference includes fomites, contact events, and laboratory-acquired infections from injection (such as a needle stick, scalpel injury, animal bite, or exposure of existing break to the skin barrier), inhalation (suit failure) or ingestion (e.g., drinking or eating improperly sterilized solid 633 Updated SSRA or liquid waste). Fomites are controlled by access restrictions and procedural requirements for the decontamination and sterilization of all materials prior to removal from a containment area and by personal protective equipment changes and shower out requirements. Laboratory- acquired infections are controlled by procedures and personal protective equipment (PPE) and monitored by medical response protocols and reporting requirements if an exposure (contact, inhalation, injection) is suspected or known. The conceptual pathways of potential pathogen release are illustrated in Figure 9.5- 1. Solids LiquidsTransference Aerosols Originating Location Figure 9.5-1: Pathways for Loss of Containment from ABSL-4 to the Environment In the following subsections, the modeled engineering and procedural mitigations for the loss of pathogenic material by each of the four pathways is discussed for the ABSL-4 originating locations. These discussions include an illustration of the modeled mitigation techniques derived from the 65% Design and presumptive NBAF procedures. 9.5.1 Aerosols Like all high-containment facilities, NBAF design and operational strategies depend on sound laboratory practices and layered engineering solutions. Specifically with regard to air handling filtration systems, good laboratory practices are used to minimize the creation of aerosols. Layered engineering solutions include the use of BSCs, negative pressure and directional airflow, in-laboratory airflow patterns by design including placement of room supply and room exhaust, air exchange rates, HEPA filtration, single\u00ad 634 Updated SSRA pass circulation, systems, necropsy tables, etc.), biocontainment dampers, and other manual and automated safety systems. As in the BSL-3Ag described in Section 4, the ABSL-4 AHRs become the primary containment barrier and effective building air handling and filtration systems are critical to successful biocontainment. 9.5.1.1 ABSL-4 Animal Holding Rooms Like the BSL-3Ag rooms, ABSL-4 AHRs will use HEPA-filtered supply air and double-HEPA exhaust filtration to protect against and reduce the probability of an agent release. There are two BSL-4 large ! \u00d7 the CDC and NIH publication on Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL-5th Edition) [USDHHS/CDCP 2007], the BSL-4 AHR exhaust air is filtered by two HEPA filters in series. The NBAF design, as depicted in the conceptual model provided in Figure 9.5.1-1, incorporates two filtration caissons (each with two HEPA filters in series).In Figure 9.5.1-1 and subsequent conceptual model figures, the controls and fault/event tree nodes are illustrated (at the left of the figure) in the same arrangement that was used to calculate associated failure rates described in detail later within the Fault Analyses and Event description section. ! AHR) to remove larger airborne particulate (e.g., detritus, dust, hair, etc.) that could potentially accelerate HEPA performance degradation or damage a filter surface. The room air is divided in a plenum to flow through both caissons to achieve the HEPA series filtration. Flow balance is accomplished with a control valve at the exhaust plenum. Each of the caissons also has an independent set of bubble-tight bio-seal dampers than can be used to isolate both flow paths and the AHR. Each caisson also includes a pre-filter section (in addition to the rough filter) that is intended to remove large airborne particulates and aerosols. However, like the rough filters, no removal of virus is attributed to this filter. Test and scan areas are incorporated before and after each HEPA filter. The entire room exhaust flow can be diverted to either one of the parallel caissons in the event that service is needed on one caisson or an anomalous pressure indication is reported by the control system. This configuration provides a 2N redundancy. 635 Updated SSRA PenetrationABSL-4 AHR & Necropsy Infectious Aerosols Rough Filter Penetration Plenum Bio-Seal Damper (Fail Close) Pre-filter Test Inlet HEPA Alarm Autoscan Test Inlet HEPA Alarm Autoscan Alarm Bio-Seal Damper (Fail Close) Plenum ExhaustFault Tree Node Conceptual Model Rough Filter Bio-Seal Holding Necropsy Exhaust System 9.5.1.2 ABSL-4 Necropsy The ABSL-4 necropsy rooms are primarily designed for large animals. Infected animals will be moved from the ABSL-4 AHR to the directly connected shared necropsy space through a pen and gate system if the animal is moving under its own power. Within necropsy there is a small squeeze chute that may be configured to hold the animal during euthanasia and then the overhead-rail hoist system will be used to 636 Updated SSRA move the carcass within the necropsy suite, as needed. Downdraft workstations are used in the necropsy area to assist with the removal of procedurally-generated aerosols. The primary room exhaust air handling system are identical to those described for the ABSL-4 AHRs. Every HEPA filtration in an exhaust process was modeled as having the same efficiency and as detailed below. HEPA Efficiency The HEPA specifications used within this assessment are based on the filtration efficiency of the Most Penetrating Particle Size (MPPS), which is specified as 0.3 \u00b5m (300 nm). HEPA filters must arrest 99.99% of the MPPS particles, inferring that the filtration efficiency for smaller and larger particulates and aerosols will be greater than 99.99% (per Specifications 23 41 15 -3). Refer to Section 4.0 for studies on efficacy of HEPA filtration in the containment of airborne microorganisms. For modeling purposes, consideration was given to the selection of a nominal pass-through factor derived from specifications (3 \u00d7 10-4 and 1 \u00d7 10-4) and the published references described in Section 4.0. A summary of the specifications and findings is provided in Table 4.2.1-1 and again in Table 9.5.1-1. The pass-through factors quoted in the studies by Kowalski, Wang, and Arunkumar are based on empirical data and provide the basis for selection of the modeled pass-through factor of 1 \u00d7 10-5 per HEPA filter applied in this assessment. Table 9.5.1 -1: HEPA Filter Pass -Through Factors \u00d7 10-6 In HEPA filtration installations, there is some potential for small leaks at the filter frame or housing seals (either resulting from manufacturing defects or human errors) that could reduce the efficiency of the filter. The NBAF 65% Design incorporates systems to monitor the pressure differential across each HEPA filter and across the entire HEPA caisson (Autoscan or equivalent feature), and performs installation particulate challenges designed to detect small leaks should they be present so that failed installments are never allowed to go operational. No other virus removal (other than the sequential HEPA filters) is modeled in the room exhaust removal process. 637 Updated SSRA Once installed, at any given time each individual HEPA filter may be in a non-degraded (fault-less), degraded condition, shut-off (if alarm is functional), or open without providing filtration (alarms fail). Each of these HEPA filter operational conditions is modeled in Section 9.8 where the specific reduction factors and probability of such conditions existing are provided. 9.5.2 Solid Waste and Equipment/Property During the performance of an experiment, solid waste will be generated and articles will become contaminated. At the NBAF, the safe removal of waste from the containment areas is accomplished by a combination of different engineered systems and practices that have been validated and successful in many BSL-3E and BSL-4 facilities for years. Pass-through autoclaves are used to sterilize (autoclave\u00ad tolerant) materials before removal from containment areas at the NBAF. Solid waste exiting the BSL- 4 spaces will be autoclaved via the double door, pass-through autoclave to the BSL-3E spaces, where it will be autoclaved a second time out of the BSL-3E space and then incinerated. Reusable potentially contaminated laundry (garments worn in BSL-4 containment within the fully encapsulated suit) is doffed in the outer change room and is autoclaved out of the BSL-4 outer change room to the BSL-3E corridor, and is laundered in the laundry processing facility within the BSL-3E containment space. Non-waste materials, such as equipment and samples are disinfected by other mechanisms that include chemical disinfectant wipedown, disinfectant dunk tanks, and decontaminating showers. The solid waste and equipment removal pathway is discussed for each originating location in the following subsections. The modeled conceptual illustration of solid waste and contaminated materials handling for the ABSL- 4 AHRs and necropsy room is presented in Figure 9.5.2- 1. 638 Updated SSRA ABSL -4 Animal Holding Rooms Infectious Waste Preparation Chemical Shower Chemical Shower/ Dunk Tank Autoclave, Dunk, Tissue Autoclave Nominal BSL-3Ag/3E Barrier features Waste Batching and in-vitro Laboratories Autoclave, Dunk, Shower Irradiation of Samples Leaving BSL-3 Incineration On-Site Movements DispositionFault Tree Node Conceptual Model BSL-3E Waste Core Autoclave Waste DockIncineration Municipal Solid WasteEquipment Waste Containers Samples (Packaged) Autoclave/Dunk Shower/Dunk Dunk Non -Containment Laboratory Transfer/ShippingBSL-3E Sample IrradiationChemical Dunk Tank AutoclaveCarcass Tissue Autoclave + Performance Validation Indicator Incineration Waste Dock Municipal Solid Waste Figure 9.5.2-1: Conceptual Diagram for Solid Waste and Removal of Other Items from ABSL-4 AHRs and ABSL-4 Necropsy Room 639 Updated SSRA 9.5.2.1 ABSL-4 Animal Holding Rooms The solid waste generated in the ABSL-4 AHRs is collected and containerized in the AHR, similar to the BSL-3Ag protocols. The waste containers along with any equipment and packaged samples to be moved out of the ABSL-4 AHR will be moved first through a chemical shower. Small items may also be moved through a dunk tank into the BSL-3E corridor. Larger solid waste items will then be autoclaved for movement into the BSL-3E corridor. Once in the BSL-3E dirty corridor, the waste container is transported to the end of the corridor to a second pass-through autoclave. Equipment and other materials are decontaminated as appropriate. If the equipment or material can be processed by an autoclave, it will also be transported via the dirty corridor to the pass-through autoclaves. If autoclaving is not an option, the equipment or material will be wiped down with a disinfectant (as specified by the NBAF Biosafety Officer) and processed in a pass-through gaseous decontamination chamber. The gaseous decontamination chamber also terminates in the BSL-3E area. According to current plans, samples and other personal effects are retained by the personnel exiting the AHR through the dirty anteroom. Surface disinfection of these items is accomplished by immersion in a disinfection solution (i.e., a dunk tank) and the efficacy of these procedures is described in Section 9.5.4. (The specific disinfectant, concentration, and immersion time are yet to be determined by the NBAF Biosafety Officer; however efficiencies of standard practices have been determined and applied for the purposes of this assessment.) It is important to note that current NBAF protocols do not require the removal of the solid fraction of animal waste by this method. The solid fraction (feces) and liquid fraction (primarily urine) of animal waste generated in the AHRs are disposed of by the liquid EDS as described in subsequent sections. Efficiency of Autoclaves Modern autoclaves are capable of accommodating many different sizes and shapes of material while providing effective sterilization when used correctly. With appropriate pressure, temperature, steam, and exposure time, practically any virus material can be neutralized in an autoclave. The NBAF 65% Design provides preliminary procurement specifications for the autoclaves that will be used at the NBAF [GMP-3, 2011]. NBAF autoclaves will incorporate biological seals, door interlocks, and other safety features to ensure effective sterilization. Periodic testing of the system helps to ensure that the instrument is calibrated and operating in accordance with specifications. Bulk double-door, pass- through autoclaves (sterilizers) are used in the NBAF BSL-4 to satisfy many of the sterilization needs. Autoclaves will be used for waste and equipment in both the ABSL-4 AHRs and necropsy for removal into the BSL-3E dirty corridor for further decontamination and removal from the facility. Specific protocol development and methods validation must be performed to determine the efficiency of the installed NBAF autoclaves based on the types of materials used and sterility objectives. Lewis developed logarithmic reduction constants (D-values) to model the neutralization of microbial activity at fixed used to reduce the initial titer to a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10 -6 even with a very high initial titer. Other references provide similar results and limitations on the efficacy of the autoclave but there is limited data on the efficiency with high initial titers. The Updated SSRA uses the most representative value of autoclave efficiency of 99.9999%, which results in a pass-through factor of 10 -6. For the 640 Updated SSRA autoclaves, the systems failure rate of 1 \u00d7 10-5 was used, and if the autoclave were to fail, no reduction factor was applied (i.e., reduction factor = 1). 9.5.2.2 ABSL-4 Necropsy The solid waste generated in the ABSL-4 necropsy room is collected and containerized within the necropsy room. The modeled conceptual illustration of containerized (red-bagged) solid waste and contaminated materials handling for the ABSL-4 necropsy room is identical to that presented in Figure 9.5.2-1. All of the mitigation design and practices for the solid waste and equipment pathway are similar to those discussed for the AHRs with an additional tissue autoclave feature for the removal of animal carcasses that follows the general scheme depicted in Figure 9.5.2-1 and as described below. Tissue Autoclave The ABSL-4 necropsy room has an additional solid waste removal mechanism two carcass renderers (referred to herein as tissue autoclaves) located on the floor. As in the BSL-3Ag necropsy room, the tissue autoclave comprises a processing vessel that can accommodate up to six 500-pound carcasses (3,000 pounds total) per cycle. Alternatively, a vessel can receive and process a single 1,200 pound whole animal carcass. (Larger carcasses, if any, will have to be sectioned.) The systems are capable of heating the contents to 302 \u00b0F (150 \u00b0C) and macerating the contents during the decontamination cycle. After the decontamination cycle, excess liquids will be boiled off, vapors cooled to 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C), collected, and discharged to the EDS and vented via a double HEPA filtration system, leaving behind a semi-solid that is containerized and finally incinerated onsite. The principals of pathogen neutralization used in the tissue autoclave are the same as those of more traditional autoclaves. High temperature, high pressure, liquid content, and long exposure times combined with mechanical agitation of the contents. Thus, the modeled reduction factor of pathogen destruction for the tissue autoclave is also 10 -6 . In addition to the dual pressure and dual temperature transmitters built-into the NBAF tissue autoclave system, the performance of each tissue autoclave run will be verified using a redundant, orthogonal indicator, such as a biological indicator or independent temperature/pressure indictor (the specific indicator type is to be determined) prior to release of the contents to the incinerator or the EDS. The tissue autoclave system outlined in the 65% Design includes a biotest drywell with removable rod and adjustable basket assembly that will accommodate a biological test or other performance indicator. If the performance of the tissue autoclave is not verified, the contents will be subject to another round of tissue autoclave decontamination and verification. This redundant tissue autoclave system verification provides an additional layer of fault protection with a systems failure rate of 1 \u00d7 10-5 . Efficiency of Incineration NBAF waste management incorporates the use of redundant self-contained medical waste incineration systems that are capable of processing up to 400 pounds/hour. Each incinerator will have at least two combustion chambers: the primary chamber shall be capable of maintaining a set point of 1600\u00b0F and the secondary chamber must be capable of maintaining 1800 \u00b0F. The ash removal system is automated and facilitates continuous operations, if needed. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tested the reduction of endospore counts ( B. anthracis ) and reported a five log reduction in viable spore counts 641 Updated SSRA after incineration [Wood et al., 2004]. However, this research included some experimental limitations that were noted in the report. Biological testing of a laboratory pathological waste incinerator at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Australia produced extraordinary results [Le Blanc Smith, et al., 2002]. Using another biological indicator ( Escherichia coli K12), a reduction of 108.39 PFU of bacteriophage was measured from the processes in the primary and secondary chamber and an additional 107.65 reduction was determined to occur in the stack. The total reduction factor was 1016.04 PFU. The reduction factors calculated by Le Blanc Smith are very useful, but may not be representative \u0011 the indicator was sprayed in the primary chamber a form of pathogen introduction most conducive to high kills rates. Given the large range of incineration efficiencies gleaned from the literature, and a lack of published incineration efficiency on the pathogens of specific interest, a median reduction value of 10-9 was used in the Updated SSRA and this ABSL-4 assessment. 9.5.3 Liquid Waste \u0011! laboratories be decontaminated by a validated method before being discharged. The Effluent Decontamination System (EDS) at the NBAF provides gravity-based drainage from each of the originating locationsthe drainage piping is sized appropriately for the anticipated waste streams and components. The mode of initial disinfection depends on the originating location it is different for the AHRs, the necropsy room, and the BSL-4 laboratories. The EDS comprises eleven cook tanks: eight cook tanks for the BSL-3Ag/3E areas and three for the BSL-4 areas (N+1). The redundant tank for the BSL-4 area can be used to provide redundant capacity for the BSL-3Ag/E areas if an anomalous condition requires its use. However, BSL-3E/Ag and BSL-4 liquid effluents will not be combined in a cook tank. Each cook tank has a minimum capacity of 7,500 gallons and is capable of heating (under pressure) the liquid effluent up to 270 \u00b0F (~132 \u00b0C). The contents of the cook tanks are continuously agitated as long as the tank is greater than 50% full during the treatment period. Multiple process alarms provide indications to the control system and operators if any system failure or anomaly is detected in the system during the decontamination process . A recently-added engineering control that adds an independent and redundant verification indicator of cook tank performance prior to releasing liquid waste from the NBAF has mitigated the risk along this release pathway. The conceptualized and modeled liquid (less the redundant temperature monitori) waste flow for the BSL-4 containment areas is provided in Figure 9.5.3-1. All liquid effluent from the containment areas is processed through the EDS. The barrier change room (showers and restrooms), laundry, and other restrooms in the containment area are all serviced by the decontamination system. 642 Updated SSRA ABSL Waste Decontamination atSource Piping Cook Tank + Performance Validation Indicator Alarm Effluent Removal On-Site Wastew ater Treatment Plant On-Site Force Main Municipal DischargeOn-Site Wastewater Treatment Plant and Retention On- Site Force Main Municipal SewerFault Tree Node Conceptual Model Cook Tank N=2 (+1) Heat Exchange Mixing Ejection to On -Site WWTP Figure 9.5.3-1: Conceptual Diagram for Liquid Effluent Collection and Treatment for All Originating Locations in BSL-4 Containment 643 Updated SSRA 9.5.3.1 ABSL-4 Animal Holding Rooms The AHRs floors are equipped with grated drains for animal waste and other liquid wastes. Traps on the grated drains will be primed with a suitable disinfectant according to standard animal containment practices. The disinfectant mixes with existing liquid waste in the drain trap and as the trap drains, some fraction of the disinfectant is discharged (along with the liquid effluent) to a designated cook tank where it is mixed with liquid effluent from other AHRs, the necropsy room, and the BSL-3E laboratories and Special Procedure rooms prior to heat treatment. The NBAF Biosafety Officer will determine the protocols and frequencies of AHR wash downs. The purpose of the wash down is to remove animal waste products from the walls, floors, and animals to provide a hygienic environment for the research animals, researchers, and to satisfy research objectives. Nominally, AHR wash downs will occur twice per day (~every 12 hours); however, the frequency will be largely dependent on the study and personnel requirements and constraints. The wash down will be preceded by priming the floor drains with suitable disinfectant. All other drains (including showers) in the ABSL-4 AHR areas drain into the cook tanks. The material available for release estimated for the AHRs accounts for re-aerosolization of material due to activities in the room, such as wash-downs, animal movement or staff movement. The upper end of the range of disinfectant efficiency is bounded by the maximum efficiency (99.9999%) or the modeled nominal value of 99.999%. If it is assumed that each deep seal P trap (estimated volume 1-2 L) is primed with a high concentration of disinfectant, the liquid fraction of animal manure (depending on species, number of animals, and room type) will likely dilute the trap volume no data is available on the decontamination efficiency for diluted disinfectant volumes and its ability to work on mixed waste in the trap. In addition, residual disinfection of aggregated AHR effluent in the cook tank should be considered. Empirical data will eventually need to be collected to more precisely characterize the efficiency of the specific disinfectants used for NBAF-specific conditions. For the purpose of modeling, it is assumed that the low end of disinfectant efficiency is 50% and the high end is 99%, with the most representative value being 90%. In terms of the disinfectant pass-through factor, these modeling assumptions equate to a reduction factor of 1 \u00d7 10 -1 for each drain pipe in the animal holding rooms. In the ABSL-4 AHRs, there are a total of 12 drain pipes, six in each AHR. 9.5.3.2 ABSL-4 Necropsy The ABSL-4 necropsy areas only produce a fraction of the animal waste products that are generated in the AHRs at all containment levels. Animals are euthanized on entry to the necropsy area and relatively small amounts of liquid animal waste (feces/urine) products are generated during this process. However, the two floor drains in the necropsy areas will drain infected blood, blood products, and other contaminated animal fluids and potentially small tissue fragments. The necropsy tables are equipped with sinks and drain pans that collect most of the liquids and excised tissue that is not collected for disposal in the tissue digesters. Based on activity levels and research objectives, washdowns will also be performed in the necropsy area with all liquid waste being discharged to the EDS. In general, the liquid waste effluent in the necropsy area is scheduled or at least more predictable than effluent generated in the AHRs. Thus, the practice of priming the drain traps is assumed to be more effective. While it will still be necessary to characterize the effectiveness of disinfection practices with the collection of empirical 644 Updated SSRA data, it can be assumed that the source disinfection rates in the necropsy area are between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude more efficient. Thus, the modeled reduction factor of the disinfection at each individual drain pipe in the necropsy room is 1 \u00d7 10-3. In the ABSL-4 necropsy room, there are 11 drain pipes. EDS Cook Tank Efficiency Specifications from the NBAF 65% Design indicate a kill efficiency of 99.9999% (reduction factor = 1 \u00d7 10\u00ad 6) for the cook tank. This is consistent with the kill efficiencies determined for autoclaves that operate by similar mode of treatment and action. The Updated SSRA and specifically this ABSL-4 Assessment therefore applied a reduction factor of 10-6 for a successful effluent decontamination cook tank batch. Within the cook tank system designed for the NBAF, temperature and pressure are continually monitored while the cook tank is in heat mode. As a redundant check of the cook tank system, an orthogonal temperature and pressure or biological indicator (the specific type is to be determined) will be included in each cook tank batch. The temperature/pressure or biological indicator performance will be verified after each batch prior to release of the contents to the onsite wastewater pretreatment plant. If the performance is not verified, the contents will be subject to another round of cook tank decontamination and verification. This redundant cook tank system verification provides an additional layer of fault protection with a systems failure rate of 1 \u00d7 10-5 . On-Site Wastewater Treatment Efficiency and Dilution On-site treatment of wastewater from the NBAF will be performed prior to discharge in an effort to reduce the BOD (biological oxygen demand) on the Manhattan, Kansas sewer system. In addition to reducing the BOD, if there were a release from the EDS at the NBAF, the on-site wastewater treatment will likely result in some reduction of total viable pathogen (e.g., NiV/HeV) as well as serve as another dilution point for the laboratory-generated waste effluent. No specific data regarding NiV and HeV degradation during wastewater treatment were available, although SMEs agreed that some level of degradation is likely to occur. To address this issue, the Updated SSRA turned to the published works of Irving and Smith who recorded enterovirus reductions of 93% during wastewater treatment [Irving, Smith, 1981]. Based on this information, a modest 1 order of magnitude reduction during wastewater treatment was assumed (wastewater reduction factor = 10-1) for the ABSL-4 assessment. At the NBAF, the sterilized effluent (EDS discharge) from the containment areas is mixed with other effluent waste from the laboratory building before the wastewater from the laboratory is discharged. From the laboratory building, the average total daily flow and average maximum daily flow are 40,248 gpd and 58,411 gpd, respectively [NDP, 2010]. It is estimated that 10% of this volume is from non-containment contributions. Effluent from the Central Utility Plant, the Transshipping Facility, and the Water Treatment office space contribute an estimated additional 10% to the treatment system influent. Thus, it is approximated that 85% of the discharge into the Manhattan sanitary sewer system originated from containment sources. 645 Updated SSRA 9.5.4 Transference The transference events are intended to model the transfer of viable NiV or HeV from the NBAF to a susceptible person/animal by mechanisms other than those modeled for the aerosol, solid waste, and liquid waste pathways. The faults recognized in the transference events are primarily driven by human error. As concluded in the 2010 SSRA and confirmed in Finding 9 of the NAS SSRA Committee, human error is the most likely cause of an accidental pathogen release. The failure probabilities and estimates used in modeling the events from non-transference pathways include contributions from both human error and mechanical/material failures. The faults recognized in the transference events are primarily driven by human error. There are a virtually unlimited number of accident event sequences that could be theorized and modeled to represent the risk of containment loss by these pathways. A panel of containment facility SMEs was solicited to provide an as-complete- as-possible list of the unique concerns associated with ABSL-4 research; these events are summarized later in Section 9.6 and described in detail within Section 9.7. Included in these SME derived events; are all associated routes of potential exposure which have been reflected in the conceptual models designed for each transference event, either through injection, inhalation, or fomite contact. 9.5.4.1 BSL-4 Animal Holding Rooms and Necropsy Room Transference During periods of animal infection, the ABSL-4 AHRs are essentially a primary containment vessel people and objects are potentially exposed to NiV or HeV in aerosols, solid waste, and liquid waste. The AHRs and necropsy room are used as the representative originating locations for transference events involving human respiratory exposure, contact exposure and fomites. The mitigation measures that will be used to reduce the respiratory and contact contamination include complete BSL-4 suit encapsulation with respiratory support, room-specific outer footwear/boots, clothing changes, decontaminating shower and subsequent body shower from the ABSL-4 AHR to BSL-3E, and the shower/clothing and boot change upon exit from the BSL-3E. In instances where skin is knowingly exposed with pathogenic material, chemical disinfection (spot treatment) of an exposed area, such as the hand, provides an additional mitigation layer. Mitigation measures for fomites include disinfection procedures (dunk, wipedown, autoclave, or gaseous decontamination) between the BSL-4 areas and BSL-3E and a second disinfection procedure upon exit from BSL-3E. A conceptual diagram of exposure mitigations and corresponding fault tree nodes associated with the ABSL-4 transference events are provided in Figure 9.5.4- 1. All animals utilized at the facility are euthanized, regardless of infected status. The euthanasia typically system of hoists designed to assist in the movement of a downed or deceased large animal. Followi ng euthanasia, the carcass is stored, a necropsy performed, or prepared for the carcass disposal system. During these activities, the researcher or animal handling staff has the potential to become exposed to blood, body fluids and other fine pieces of animal tissues if there are breaches in PPE. 646 Updated SSRA ABSL -4 Large Animal Holding Rooms, Necropsy RoomFault Tree Node Conceptual Model Containment Staff Encapsulated Suit Protection Disinfecting Chemical Spot treatment BSL-4 Soap & Water Shower/Change BSL-3 Soap & Water Shower/Change Exposure Reporting/Medical Monitoring & Response PracticesContamination Sources Contact, Injection, Respiratory Exposure Protection Chemical Shower, Dunk Tank Chemical Spot TreatmentDecontaminating Chemical ShowerDunk Tank Body Shower #1 Body Shower #2 Laboratory Exposure Report, Medical Response Figure 9.5.4-1: Conceptual Diagram for Transference Events Laboratory Exposure Transference - Injection A critical pathway considered for transference of NiV or HeV (applicable to any agent in study within the BSL-4 containment area) is the possibility of injection, through needle stick injury, contaminated scalpel injury, animal bite, or contamination of an existing wound or break in the skin of the laboratory worker. In particular the inoculation of large animals (primarily equines and bovine species) with concentrated virus during study initiation presents a risk of a needle stick. The risk is confounded when large animals are the study model due to the added potential loss of control of the animal during the inoculation event. Per the panel of containment facility SMEs, uncontrolled animal movement (e.g., agitated animals, improper use of pen and gate systems, etc.,) increases the potential for worker injury (through 647 Updated SSRA kicking, biting, worker displacement etc.,) and/or a suit breach (tear, hose entanglement, cut or puncture) that may lead to subsequent exposure to laboratory workers. If the primary level of personal protection (BSL-4 suit) is breached (i.e., the needle surpasses the suit) and the skin barrier of the laboratory worker is punctured or broken, it is assumed that approximately 5% transfer from a one- milliliter inoculum syringe occurs (one drop of approximately 50 \u00b5L, corresponding to 5% of the 1 mL). While data is not available to directly substantiate this transfer value for NiV and HeV, studies on the rates of exposure of other viruses and bacterial pathogens suggest that this load represents a reasonable amount capable of a subcutaneous dose and infection event. The needle stick injury event will be treated as a laboratory-acquired infection that requires the requisite incident reporting and medical response as dictated by standard practice and NBAF protocols. Laboratory Exposure Transference - Inhalation (Respiratory) An exposure to NiV or HeV via the inhalational pathway implies that a number of events must occur in the ABSL-4 area to make that material available for respiration. With the release of aerosolized agent through a spill, conducting necropsy procedures, or other aerosol generating activities, a corresponding breach in the BSL-4 suit and a loss of positive pressure must occur such that sufficient viable virus material is available for a respiratory exposure capability of initiating an infection. As studies are not available on the amount of NiV or HeV a person may inhale during ABSL-4 research activities or harbor in their nasal passage after performing ABSL-4 research activities the Updated SSRA will leverage information on available FMDv data presented previously in Table 4.2.4-1 and based on the works of Sellers and Parker. For ABSL-4 Transference respiratory exposure events, it is assumed that 5.7% of the aerosolized levels of NiV or HeV available in the AHR or necropsy room will be transferred to (via respiration) and harbored in the re Laboratory Exposure Transference - Contact Upon physical contact between a surface, spill, or material contaminated with viable virus, a certain percentage will be transferred to the recipient surface or material. The contaminated fomite or individual can then act as a vehicle to transfer viable viral particles to susceptible animals or humans outside of the NBAF if not appropriately decontaminated. Two primary modes of contact transference were examined for the ABSL-4 spaces: 1) a laboratory worker cuts the BSL-4 suit through sharps use (e.g., scalpel during necropsy) that does not cause a subsequent break in the skin, but does result in skin contact with infectious material (such as the palm of the hand); and 2) an infectious sample that is being packaged and transferred out of necropsy room containment is placed in a container that is contaminated (on the outside) with NiV or HeV resulting in a potentially infectious fomite being transferred out of containment. Using the same approach to calculating transfer efficiency as the BSL- 3 assessments, the transfer efficiency in a contact event varies greatly depending on the conditions and parameters of the contact, including the physical state of the donor material (wet or dry), contact duration, contact pressure, friction applied during contact, and the time between deposition and contact. Ansari et al. measured transfer efficiencies of approximately 16% for human rotavirus for a dry, 10-second contact between a stainless steel disc and fingerpad [Ansari et al., 1988]. Mbithi et al. calculated similar transfer efficiencies for hepatitis A virus (22%) between a steel disc and a fingerpad under dry conditions [Mbithi et al., 1992]. In a more recent study, Knobben et al. evaluated transfer 648 Updated SSRA efficiencies of bacteria under dry and moist conditions between fomites and a glove and obtained an average efficiency of 42% for moist conditions without friction applied [Knobben et al., 2007]. Similarly, Julian et al. studied virus transfers for MS2 and bacteriophages for a dry, 10-second contact, and determined 21 to 39% of the deposited material was transferred [Julian et al., 2010]. Cohen et al. characterized residue transfer using a fluorescent tracer under a variety of contact conditions and determined that higher transfer efficiencies were obtained with greater pressure and upon moist conditions, with efficiencies ranging from 0.6 to 49% under all conditions [Cohen Hubal et al., 2007]. In earlier work, Reed also determined that transfer efficiencies of rhinovirus were greater with damp material, ranging from 0.6% to 49% (average of 22%) [Reed, 1975]. Based on these data, for the transference events that will typically involve contact with liquid spills or moist, contaminated material, a transfer efficiency of 40% is used in the Updated SSRA. Transference - Contact Person to Person Contact from person to person through an unmitigated and unreported laboratory-acquired infection provides a potential for exposure and resultant disease in the population at large. Standard human error is the only attributable probability, as an appropriate response to suspected or known exposure through medical monitoring (including contact precautions) and reporting is likely to reduce the potential for subsequent person-to person spread. In the event that a laboratory-acquired infection goes unreported, unmonitored and escapes containment via a human vector, the resultant infection rate of close contacts is high for NiV. Initial reporting for HeV translates to approximately 10% efficiency rate for transfer in person to person close contact infections, significantly lower in comparison to NiV. See Section 9.9 for a discussion of the transmission factors and probability of infection rates applied across all the events analyzed. Efficiency of Fully Encapsulated Positive Pressure BSL-4 Suits In the BSL-4 facilities, all workers will don fully-encapsulated suits and rely on air supplied directly to the individual suit. The efficacy of the positive pressure BSL-4 suits will be used for modeling the respiratory protections. Anecdotal information provided by BSL-4 suit users at a recent (October 2011) National Institutes of Health Research Festival points to defects in the feet or zippers as common areas of manufacturer defects leading to suit leaks. Defects in the suits are an important consideration for the laboratory worker, and thus a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of the suit is a vital step in preparation for entrance into the B SL-4 facilities. ILC Dover, a manufacture of BSL-4 positive pressure suits, tested the protection of their Model 3525 Chemturion Chemical suits in accordance with the NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) 1991 Standard on Vapor-Protective Ensembles for Hazardous Materials Emergencies by releasing SF 6 and measuring the chemical concentration levels inside and outside of the suits [ILC Dover, 2002]. All suits were tested with air supplied to the suit at 9 cfm and six different suits were evaluated. The penetration efficiencies (equivalent to the reduction factor) at three different regions of the suits and the average penetration efficiencies are shown in Table 9.5.4- 1. 649 Table 9.5.4 -1: Chemical Dover Chemturion Model 3525 BSL -4 Suits a a a Suit Breathing Zone Suit Closure Exhaust Valve 6.697 \u00d7 10 5 7.253 \u00d7 10 5 - - Average = 6.699 \u00d7 10 5 (\u00b1 1.038 \u00d7 10 5) a all measurements of SF 6 inside these suit regions were below the limit of detection Updated SSRA As all measured values were below the detection limit, a reduction factor of one order of magnitude b etter than the average presented in Table 9.5.4-1, 6.7 \u00d7 10-6, was used to represent the respiratory protection of the BSL-4 positive pressure suits. If there was a small tear or leak in the suit it was assumed (with SME input) that positive pressure would be maintained but that some reduction in respiratory protection would result; thus the reduction factor was set to 1 \u00d7 10-3 to represent this degraded respiratory performance condition If positive pressure was lost (due to large breach in the suit, or small breach coupled with loss of air supply), the suit was modeled as not providing any protection. Although manufacturer failures of BSL-4 suits are possible and documented as stated above; suit mechanical failure to the point at which the positive pressure air supply fails is a very low probability event. More probable however, is the failure of the person donning the BSL-4 suit to follow movement restriction protocols within the ABSL-4 environment (that prevent suit snags and tears on pens or coming into contact with animals that may scratch/bite/kick or otherwise breach the suit) or to perform complete testing and verification of suit performance prior to donning in the BSL-4 Change Room. Accordingly, BSL-4 suit failures are assigned the probabilities associated with human error as opposed to mechanical failure of the suit. Efficiency of Disinfectants for Wipedown and Dunk Tanks The effective use of disinfectants is critical to the safe operation of any biocontainment laboratory. Specific disinfectant(s) should be identified by the NBAF Biosafety Officer who will give consideration to many factors in the selection process. These factors include suitability for the pathogen, concentration, 650 Tab le 9.5.4-2: Effica rine Diox ide Disi nfectant Conc. Organism Time (%) Reduction Factor Refe rence 6 \u00b5M coliphage aureus coli 1.0 7 0.999995 5.00 al., 5.00 5.00 Zoni et al., 2007 Updated SSRA application method, contact time, stability, and special procedures or safety precautions [Dvorak, 2008]. Reduction factors are reported in the 10-4 to 10-5 range for commercially-available decontamination solutions such as glutaraldehyde and chlorine dioxide commonly used in BSL-4 decontamination for NiV, HeV, and other high-risk pathogens. However, some disinfectants were noted to completely inactivate viruses like SARS. A list of the efficacies and reduction factors for chlorine dioxide against a variety of biological agents is shown in Table 9.5.4- 2 [Taylor and Butler, 1982; Chen and SSRA 9.5.4 -2: Efficacy of Chlorine Dioxide Disinfectant Conc. Organism Time (min) pH Efficacy (%) Reduction Factor Reference 0.6 mg/L HAV 2.5 7 0.999990 1.00 \u00d7 Dev. 0.000004 4.02 \u00d7 10-6 Based on the reported efficiencies, and given that the precise disinfectants are not yet identified for the NBAF, for the purposes of modeling in the Updated SSRA, the conservative representative reduction value by any disinfectant is considered to be 10-5. NBAF protocols on use of dunk tanks, when followed properly, should then result in a 99.999% efficiency of decontamination of materials introduced , with a reduction factor of 10-5. Efficiency of Decontaminating (Chemical) Showers Chemical decontami nating showers from the BSL -4 suites at the exit from the AHRs, necropsy rooms and the BSL -4 laboratory may utilize a variety of chemical disinfectants to provide maximum efficiency in decontaminating the exterior of the fully encapsulated suits worn in th e BSL -4 spaces. The precise disinfectants have not been established for the NBAF; however, due to efficacy, health and safety, and common practices in BSL -4 containment, it is probable that quaternary ammonia based disinfectants will be used. According to a document published by the Division of the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources at the University of Nebraska -Lincoln, quaternary ammonia compounds are effective against enveloped viruses [Kennedy et al., 2000]. A literature review did not revea l any studies/papers reporting the specific effect of quaternary ammonia compounds on NiV/HeV; however, others [Kennedy et al., 2000, Suarez et al., 2003, Best et al., 1994] reported the effectiveness of this disinfectant on other enveloped viruses. A quat ernary ammonia compound used in other BSL -4 laboratories, Micro -Chem Plus, has reported virucidal activity against enveloped viruses between 3.0 -6.0 log [National Chemical Laboratories, Inc., Micro -Chem Plus Datasheet]. As no exact data were available rega rding the efficacy of quaternary ammonia (or any other suitable disinfectant) against NiV and HeV, based on the data reported for other enveloped viruses, a representative reduction value of 10-5 was applied. Efficiency of Spot Decontamination of Skin Exp osure Once an infectious agent has come into contact with the skin (suspected or known contact), spot decontamination should provide complete decontamination of the surface up to the probability of human error to follow effective decontamination procedures . The combination of hand -washing procedures, spot decontamination and chemical shower out of BSL -4 facilities contribute to an efficiency of 99.999% (reduction factor of 10-5), identical to the efficiency attributed to chemical shower and dunk tank disinf ections modeled individually. Updated SSRA Efficiency of Water Body Showers Studies on the efficacy of water showering for removing contamination upon exit from animal pathogen laboratories have not been found. However, the results of numerous studies that have quantified the effectiveness of hand washing at removing viral contamination were identified. A 2004 review by Kampf and Kramer reports data from Bellamy [Bellamy et al., 1993] on the removal of rotavirus from hands when washing with plain soap and water or water alone [Kampf and Kramer, 2004]. A range of 1.17-1.19 log 10 TCID 50 of virus (6.8%-7.6%) remained. Other studies by Ansari and Mbithi performed similar experiments with rotavirus, HAV, and poliovirus, and found a removal rate of 81.44-98.39%, 6.11%\u00ad 18.56% remained [Ansari et al, 1989] [Mbithi et al., 1993]. Without data specific to water showers and NiVHeV, or emerging infectious agent removal, these data were used to model the rate of virus removal by decontamination showers as a beta distribution with a mean of 89.9% removal (10.1% remain) and a standard deviation of 6.6%. The use of personal protective equipment and the complete removal of apparel exposed to a viral- contaminated environment provide a valuable barrier layer to the contamination of skin. However, microorganisms on the skin surface can be effectively removed when water and a cleansing agent such as a soap or detergent are used simultaneously [Ayliffe et al, 1990]. Any procedure involving showering of an individual will result in significant removal of contamination from the skin surface [Aml\u00f4t et al., 2010]. Aml\u00f4t also showed, with a fluorescent tracer contaminant, that the use of a washcloth can enhance the removal of a skin contamination by approximately 20%. Unfortunately, this study did no t quantify the overall removal efficiency of the contamination. However, data on the efficiency of removal of bacteria by shower indicate that 84% to 98% of contamination is removed by a single washing with unmedicated liquid soap [Ojaj\u00e4rvi, 1981]. For hand washing, it has been demonstrated that the mean percentages of virus removal with liquid soap and water alone are 86.9% and 83.6%, respectively [Ansari, 1989]. In consideration of the data reviewed, the removal efficiency for the body showering process is modeled as 90% meaning that 10%, or 1 \u00d7 10 -1, of the skin contamination survives the showering process. 9.6 Event Summary 9.6.1 Event Circumstances Based on the activities and experiments to be performed in the ABSL-4 AHR and necropsy laboratories in the NBAF, a total of sixteen circumstances (resulting in 109 events) were modeled that can result in a release of infectious material via the four pathways under consideration. These sixteen circumstances were solely developed around activities that are unique to handling and working with large animals (e.g., cattle, horses, sheep, pigs) in the BSL-4 environment. Further, critical feedback from subject matter experts was used to develop and refine these situations based on containment community collective concerns regarding working with large animals infected with zoonotic pathogens within BSL- 4 containment [November ABSL-4 Assessment SME Solicitation meeting]. The sixteen circumstances are detailed in Table 9.6.1-1 and include eight originating from the ABSL-4 AHRs and eight originating from activities in the ABSL-4 necropsy room. 653 Updated SSRA 6 54 Table 9.6.1 -1: ABSL -4 Event Circumstance Summary Originating Label Location Pathway Situation Leading to a Release of Infectious Material L4AAi AHR Aerosol (Inoculation) Animal sed ation failure and squeeze chute failure results in inoculum being dropped, container failing, and the release of the aerosolized fraction of the inoculum L4AA AHR Aerosol Respiring infected animals secreted infectious material into the AHRs as an aerosol L4AL AHR Liquid Waste Disposal of infectious liquid waste generated in AHRs L4AS AHR Solid Waste Disposal of infectious solid (red bag) waste generated in AHRs L4ATIi AHR Transference (Injection, Inoculation) Failure to sedate and restrain animal resul ts in a failed inoculation event in which the researcher accidentally punctures the suit and skin barrier with the syringe resulting in self -inoculation Failure to restrain a nd pen animals results in an uncontrolled animal that causes a severe cut in L4ATR AHR Transference (Respiratory) the researcher suit and loss of positive pressure (either through the large cut or hose entanglement) resulting in an exposure to infectious aerosols Failure to restrain and pen animals r esults in an uncontrolled animal that bites the researcher L4ATI AHR Transference (Injection) through PPE gear, breaks the skin barrier and results in direct exposure to infectious material from the oral/nasal region of the animal Transference Researc her fails to test suit and enters ABSL -4 AHR with a suit with leaks, or the researcher fails L4ATRs AHR to pay attention to their movements in the ABSL -4 AHR and tears a small hole in the suit, (Respiratory, Suit Failure) resulting in degraded respiratory protection and potential exposure to in fectious aerosols L4NA Necropsy Aerosol Aerosolized infectious material released into the necropsy room L4NL Necropsy Liquid Waste Disposal of liquid waste generated in necropsy room L4NSW Necropsy Solid Waste (Red Bag) Dispo sal of solid (red bag) waste generated in necropsy room Solid Waste L4NST Necropsy (Tissue/Carcasses) Disposal of animal tissue and carcasses generated in necropsy room Updated SSRA 655 Table 9.6.1 -1: ABSL -4 Event Circumstance Summary Originating Label L4NTRs Location Pathway Transference Situation Leading to a Release of Infectious Material Necropsy (Respiratory, Suit Failure) Researcher fails to test sui t and enters ABSL -4 AHR with a suit with leaks exposing them to infectious aerosols L4NTI Necropsy Transference (Injection) Researcher cuts through PPE with a necropsy tool (e.g., scalpel) , PPE does not protect the skin barrier, resulting in a direct tra nsfer of infectious material from the contaminated tool to the researcher via injection L4NTCp Necropsy Transference (Contact, Palm) Researcher cuts through PPE, skin barrier is not compromised, but infectious material comes in direct contact with their s kin (e.g., palm) L4NTCf Necropsy Transference (Contact, Fomite) Infectious sample is being packaged for shipment out of the necropsy room and the surface of container is contaminated Updated SSRA 9.7 Pathogen Source Terms To determine the risk of working with BSL-4 zoonotic foreign animal diseases, the typical amounts of these agents involved in BSL-4 activities were determined. These amounts of material, specifically concentration or infectious quantity distributions, used in experiments and procedures involving large animals in BSL-4 were used in accident event models. Research conducted in the ABSL-4 is expected to involve foreign animal and zoonotic diseases such as NiV, HeV, Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFv) or emerging biological agents. It is important to note that NiV and HeV were used as the representative pathogens by which to estimate the risk of working with infected livestock in ABSL-4 containment. Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFv) may also be studied within ABSL-4 containment at the NBAF but because the 2010 SSRA previously characterized the impact of RVFv through a quantitative risk assessment and there is no current requirement to study RVFv at the BSL-4 level; the focus of this assessment remained on estimating the never previously characterized risks of NiV, HeV and/or emerging pathogen work on livestock within ABSL-4 containment. In order to estimate the amount of material available for release (MAR), the pathogen concentration distribution (i.e., source term) was determined by searching open source literature for experiments involving animal studies using NiV or HeV. The literature search was not limited to experiments conducted on large animals (e.g., cattle, horses, pigs, sheep), but rather all animal experiments including both vaccine and pathogenesis studies. Source term distributions were obtained for the concentration of infectious NiV and HeV in all tissues and biological matrices in which these viruses could be The source terms were also determined for the amount of material used for inoculation experiments conducted. No data were obtained on the respiratory shedding of NiV or HeV in any animal. Nor was any data obtained on NiV and HeV tissue concentrations in cattle or sheep. Due to the limited number of animal studies on these viruses, the tissue concentrations and biological matrix concentrations were averaged across all species and animals. To calculate a more accurate distribution of the viral source terms, individual measurements of specific animals, including those animals which did not become diseased, were included in the statistical analysis; (e.g., measurements of 0 PFU in tissue of an individual animal in an experiment were included to account for animals which may have been inoculated but did become diseased or infected.) In addition, only studies which had measurements of infectious virus were included in the source term distributions; no attempts were made to convert relative viral RNA levels to infectious concentrations (i.e., TCID 50 or PFU). The use and frequency of each Originating Location (e.g., AHR and necropsy room) and Pathway (e.g., aerosol, liquid waste, solid waste, transference) were estimated based on the 65% Design, expected activities in the ABSL-4 at the NBAF [Rodriguez, L., personal communication, 13 Nov 2011], and known activities at similar laboratories [Jeggo M., personal communication, 13 Nov 2011]. The use and frequency values were used in conjunction with the source terms to calculate the MAR for each set of circumstances as defined in Section 9.6. For each set of circumstances, there are mitigating nodes (see 656 Updated SSRA Section 9.5) that reduce the MAR to its Q value (or quantity of infectious material released at that stage of the accident sequence), and these Q values are presented in Section 9.8. Presented herein are the methodologies for determining the use and frequency of each Originating Location and Pathway, as well as for calculating the MAR for each set of circumstances. 9.7.1 Animal Holding Rooms 9.7.1.1 Use and Frequency - AHRs The ABSL-4 Animal Holding Rooms (AHRs) will be used by NBAF researchers to conduct large animal experiments on BSL-4 zoonotic and foreign animal disease agents such as NiV and HeV. The NBAF ABSL\u00ad 4 facility consists of two large AHRs that can each accommodate up to 2 horses (< 1440 lbs), 4 cattle (< 770 lbs), 8 pigs (< 110 lbs), or 8 sheep (< 110 lbs) [NDP, October 2011]. The AHRs are a shared resource of the NBAF tenants including the USDA ARS, USDA APHIS, and DHS. Over the course of a year, it is expected that between 8 and 10 experiments would be conducted per AHR [Rodriguez L., personal communication, 13 Nov 2011; Jeggo, M., personal communication, 13 Nov 2011]. There are two types of experiments which will likely be conducted in the ABSL-4: 1) vaccine studies which will last up to 14 weeks; and 2) pathogenesis studies lasting approximately 3 weeks. The studies are d Vaccine studies will either have ~6 large animals or ~12 smaller animals; pathogenesis studies will have either ~4 large animals or ~10 small animals. For the purposes of modeling, it was estimated that 50% of the studies will be performed on smaller animals and 50% on larger animals. Based on the expected length of the vaccine and pathogenesis studies and a total number of 20 studies per year (between the two AHRs), four vaccine studies and 16 pathogenesis studies were modeled for a total usage of 104 weeks (100% occupancy assuming all studies take the full 3 or 14 weeks between the two AHRs). For both the pathogenesis and vaccine experiments, there will be a 1 week acclimation period for the animals prior to inoculation. Upon inoculation, the animals are considered infectious. Assuming four vaccine and 16 pathogenesis studies are conducted per year, 80.8% of the time, the AHRs will be considered infectious, for a total of 588 AHR days (84 infectious weeks). A summary of the modeled use and frequency of the ABSL-4 AHRs on a per year basis is shown in Table 9.7.1- 1. 657 Table 9.7.1 -1: Summary of Use and Frequency of ABSL -4 AHRs Per Year Vaccine Pathogenesis Total per Year Range Modeled Range Modeled (2 AHRs) Experiments/yr 3 5 4 10 20 16 20 exp.

Small Animal Experiments Small Animals/Experiment 8 16 12 8 12 10 104 animals (Pigs, Sheep) Updated SSRA Based on the modeled values in Table 9.7.1-1, on a per day basis, there will be an average of 16 animals p resent in the AHRs (8 per AHR). Of these 16 animals, 11 on average will be pigs and sheep, while 5 will be cattle and horses. Using the same percent of time the animals are infectious of 80.8%, the average number of infectious animals per day were calculated. For modeling estimates, it was also presumed that on average, 50% of the large animal studies would be conducted on horses and 50% on cattle. Similarly, on average 50% of the smaller animal studies would be conducted on pigs and 50% on sheep. Additional animal characteristics such as their daily urine and fecal excretion, blood volume, and mass are included with the average number of animals present in the AHRs per day in Table 9.7.1- 2. 658 Table 9.7.1 -2: Animals per ABSL -4 AHR per Day and Animal Characteristics # Infected Average Mass Urine (L) Feces (kg) Blood (L) Animal # Per Day / Day Mass (lbs) Mass (lbs) (kg) per Day Per Day per Animal Total 16.00 12.93 --\u00ad 51800 Pigs 5.50 4.44 50 -110 75 34 1.76 2.03 2.5 Updated SSRA In the ABSL-4 AHRs it is expected that similar animal handling activities will be conducted as that in the BS L-3Ag. For the purposes of modeling, each morning two animal handlers will perform routine animal care and each evening two animal handlers will perform additional routine care. During the day, one researchers and one animal handler (or a second researcher) are expected to perform laboratory activities involving the animals (e.g., inoculation, sample collection, health monitoring); work in the ABSL-4 will involve researchers working in tandem at all times. 9.7.1.2 Aerosol Contributions - AHRs Two aerosol events were modeled for the ABSL-4 AHRs: 1) aerosol release from the dropping of a syringe of inoculum; and 2) respiring of aerosols (i.e., respiratory shedding) of infectious material by infected animals present in the AHRs. Aerosol Release through Dropped Inoculum (L4AAi) The distribution of concentrations and total amount of infectious NiV and HeV used for inoculation experiments was determined through a literature search of BSL-4 experiments conducted on animals with these viruses. Twenty-four literature sources were identified that detailed the amount of material used for inoculation, totaling 83 specific inoculation experiments on hamsters, horses, pigs, guinea pigs, cats, ferrets, monkeys, and fruit bats [Berhane et al., 2008; Bossart et al., 2009, al., 2006; al., 2004a, 2006, Li et al., Marsh et al., Mathieu et al., 2011; al., 2002, al., al., 2010, et al., 2008; Weingartl et al., 2005, 2006; Williamson et al., 1998, 2000]. A summary of the NiV and HeV inoculum distribution is shown in Table 9.7.1- 3. 659 9.7.1 -3: Distribution of NiV and 4.42 Std. Dev. 6.51 \u00d7 106 2.06 Based on the distribution of inoculum quantities, the log scale mean value and standard deviation were used to determine the MAR for this event (Table 9.7.1-4). The low and high MAR values represent \u00b1 2 standard deviations away from the mean, and the mean is the middle MAR value. The quantity released upon dropping the syringe inoculum is the aerosolized release fraction (ARF) of a spill (1 \u00d7 10-4 of the quantity in solution). Aerosol Release Respiratory Shedding (L4AA) The respiratory shedding of infected animals produced infectious aerosols that must be filtered to prevent and protect against releases. No data was found in the literature search on the respiration levels of Nipah and Hendra for infected animals, however, positive viral isolation has been measured in oral and nasal swabs of both animals and humans [Chua et al., 2001; Berhane et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010; Williamson et al., 1998] suggesting respiratory shedding. Furthermore, evidence suggests respiratory transmission, particularly for NiV [Luby et al., 2009a; b; Mounts et al., 2001; Ksiazek et al., 2011]. As no such specific data exists for NiV and HeV, for modeling an aerosol release event in the ABSL-4 AHRs, the low, medium, and high aerosol FMDv contributions from animal respiration were used (see Section 4.3 for details due to the method of FMD animal respiration data it is expected that the amounts represented in this study encompass aerosolized virus contributions from not only the respiration, but also secondary aerosols generated through other activities in the room such as person and animal movement, splashing and washdown of urine and feces, etc.). The mean respiration levels for cattle were also used for horses. A summary of the mean respiratory levels and the MAR for the aerosol release through respiratory shedding is shown in Table 9.7.1-5. It is recognized that these Low, Medium and High values may not be truly representative of the amount of virus shed by NiV and HeV infected animals, however given that the range considered spans four orders of magnitude, it is presumed that the true value is likely to fall somewhere within this range and even if it does not this body of work at 660 Tab le 9.7.1-5: Aero sol Respir ation Concentrations in ABSL -4 AHR Species Mean PFU / 24 h # Infected Animals per Day per AHR Aerosolized Material (PFU p er day) Cattle 1.37 \u00d7 104 1.01 1.38 \u00d7 104 Horse 1.37 \u00d7 104 1.01 1.38 \u00d7 104 Sheep 1.19 \u00d7 104 2.22 2.65 \u00d7 104 Swin e 4.84 \u00d7 103 2.22 1.08 \u00d7 104 Low Medium High MAR (PFU/ Day) 3.84 \u00d7 104 6.48 \u00d7 104 1.01 \u00d7 108 Tab le 9.7.1-6: Viral Concentration Dist ribution in Urine and Feces (log PFU/g) Perc entile 5th 1.20 \u00d7 102 HeV, ho rses and pigs (n = 8) Feces 6.93 \u00d7 100 101 HeV, pig s (n=2) Updated SSRA least provides a starting point estimate by which an estimated risk ranking may be achieved. Clearly as more data become available these values (and resulting conclusions) should be re-evaluated. 9.7.1.3 Liquid Waste - AHRs Liquid Waste (L4AL) The primary contribution to the liquid waste pathway in the ABSL-4 AHRs is expected to be from the urine and feces of the infected animals. The distribution of the Niv and HeV concentrations in urine and feces of infected animals was calculated. Few data points for urine and feces were found in the literature and were only found for HeV in horses and pigs [Li et al., 2010; Williamson et al., 1998]. A summary of the viral concentrations urine and feces is listed in Table 9.7.1- 6. Based on the average number of animals present in the AHRs (see Section 9.7.1.1) and their average d aily urine and fecal excretions, the MAR for the liquid waste pathway was calculated (Table 9.7.1-7). 661 Table 9.7.1 -7: Liquid Waste MAR for ABSL -4 AHRs Median Urine Median Feces # Swine 4.44 1.76 2.03 \u00d7 Solid Waste MAR from AHRs Liqui d Waste MAR Transfer Percentage to Solid Waste MAR (PFU/day) Solid Materials (PFU/Autoclave Run) Low 7.28 \u00d7 105 105 9.7.1.4 Solid Waste - AHRs Solid Waste (L4AS) The primary contribution to the solid waste pathway in the AHRs is the transfer of liquid waste to solid, disposable materials such as towels or other animal handling materials that come into contact with the urine, feces, and other infectious material in the AHRs. The NiV and HeV viral material present in the urine and feces represents a contact potential for items entering the solid waste stream. As discussed in Section 4.3, for modeling purposes, 20% of the infectious quantity in the liquid waste is estimated to be transferred to materials that will be disposed of in biohazard red bag waste and sterilized via autoclaves and incineration. In the ABSL-4 AHR, autoclave runs will be performed daily regardless of whether a complete batch of waste is generated. Thus, the MAR for the solid waste pathway is the amount of infectious material in the solid waste produced per day. Based on the values presented in Section 9.7.1.3, the MAR for the solid waste pathway in the ABSL-4 AHRs is listed in Table 9.7.1- -9: Injected \u00d7 107 Table 9.7.1 -10: Respiratory MARs from Cut Suit by Rogue Animal Aerosol Levels (PFU / 24 h) Respiratory MARs (PFU / 30 min) Low 3.84 \u00d7 104 8.00 \u00d7 102 Medium 6.48 \u00d7 104 1.35 \u00d7 103 \u00d7 \u00d7 106 Updated 9.7.1.5 Transference - AHRs Transference (Injection from Inoculum) (L4ATIi) One of the modeled transference events is the accidental injection of inoculum into a researcher. In this set of circumstances, while preparing to inoculate the animals, the animals are not appropriately restrained, the researcher is physically displaced by the animals, and the researcher accidentally injects a fraction of the inoculum into themselves. The source of pathogen involved in such a sequence of events would be the amount of material in a single syringe of inoculum. In such an event, it is expected that approximately 1 droplet would be injected (~50 \u00b5L), or approximately 5% of a 1 mL syringe. The MARs for this set of circumstances are detailed in Table 9.7.1- 9. Transference (Respiratory from Cut Suit by Uncontrolled Animal) (L4ATR) While w orking in a BSL-4 positive pressure suit in an AHR with large animals, there is a risk that the suit gets torn, in this set of circumstances by an animal which has become aggressive or that has not been properly restrained. If the suit is severely torn and the hose becomes entangled or disconnected from the suit, there will be a loss of positive pressure and a potential respiratory exposure to infectious aerosols present in the AHR. The exposure event was modeled to last for no longer than 30 minutes before the exposed individual would be able to exit the ABSL-4 AHR to the dirty vestibule. The MARs for this set of circumstances are the infectious aerosols produced in a 30 minute timeframe (as compared to the 24 h levels described in Section 9.7.1.2) and are detailed in Table 9.7.1-10. As described in Section 9.7.1.2, the pathogen aerosol source terms were derived from FMDv concentrations as no published data for NiV or HeV was found. 663 Table 9.7.1 -11: Viral Concentration Distribution in Oral/Nasal Region Percentile 5th 50th 95th Mean hamsters, guinea pigs, horses Table 9.7.1 -12: MARs from Animal Bite Injection Oro/Naso 104 1.07 \u00d7 103 Updated SSRA T ransference (Injection from Animal Bite) (L4ATI) A similar situation may occur in the AHR in which an animal which has become aggressive or that has not been properly restrained bites, kicks, or scratches a researcher resulting in an injection transference event. The MARs for this set of circumstances are based on NiV and HeV concentrations reported in the oral and nasal regions of the animals (i.e., if the injection was due to an infected animal bite these sources represent the amount of NiV or HeV available in the saliva or other bodily fluids). The distribution for virus concentrations in these biological matrices were derived from oral swabs, nasal swabs, nasal mucosa, and other oro/pharynx viral measurements in literature papers [Berhane et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010; Maisner et al., 2009; Rockx et al., 2010, 2011; Weingartl et al., 2005, 2006; Williamson et al., 1998]. A summary is presented in Table 9.7.1.-11. The 5 th, 50th, and 95th percentiles presented in Table 9.7.1-11 were used to derive the MARs by assuming that 10% of 1 g of infectious material was directly transferred (i.e., injected) into the researcher (Table 9.7.1-12). Transference (Respiratory through Suit Tear) (L4ATRs) An other potential transference event in the AHRs is a respiratory exposure due to a leak in the BSL-4 suit or a small tear caused by having the suit snagged on pens or gates within the AHR. The small leak or tear may not be noticed immediately and this respiratory exposure was estimated to occur over a 4 h time period. The MARs for this set of circumstances are the infectious aerosols produced in a 30 minute timeframe (as compared to the 24 h levels described in Section 9.7.1.2) and detailed in Table 9.7.1-13. As described in Section 9.7.1.2, the pathogen aerosol source terms were derived from FMDv concentrations as no published data for NiV or HeV was found. SMEs have reported that small leaks or tears in BSL-4 suits do not result in loss of position pressure.

For cases where there was reduced efficiency a reduction factor of 1 \u00d7 10-3 was applied versus a reduction factor of 1 \u00d7 10-6 for full functioning respirator (see Section 9.8.2.5 for detailed reductions applied per the event). 9.7.2 Necropsy 9.7.2.1 Use and Frequency - Necropsy At the NBAF, every animal that enters containment will ultimately be euthanized and a necropsy performed. The ABSL-4 in the NBAF contains two necropsy tables each with a 2000 lb load capacity [NDP, October 2011]. The necropsy room is anticipated to be staffed with two researchers. On any given work day, a necropsy can be performed on approximately 1 2 large animals (e.g., cattle, horses) or 4 6 smaller animals (e.g., pigs, sheep). As necropsies will be performed at the end of experiments, an average of 1.5 large animals or 5 smaller animals per day was assumed in the modeling [Rodriguez, L., personal communication, 13 Nov 2011]. Based on the use and frequency of the AHRs as presented in Section 9.7.1.1, a total of 148 animals are expected to be euthanized in the ABSL-4 in a year. Of these 148 animals, 44 will be large animals and 104 will be smaller animals. If an average of 1.5 large animal or 5 small animal procedures can be performed per day, it will take approximately 50 days to perform necropsies of all 148 animals. A summary of the necropsy room use in the ABSL-4 is presented in Table 9.7.2-1 using the assumptions made above and in Section 9.7.1. 665 Table 9.7.2 -2: Viral Concentr ation Distribution in hamsters, hors es, monkeys, -1.42 1.41 guinea pigs Bladder, brain, bronchial nodes, bronchus, bone marrow, heart, intestine, kidney, lung, lymph nodes, 1.03 2.92 pancreas, spinal cord, spleen, trachea, uterus; hamsters, pigs, cats, monkeys, minipigs, Release (L4NA) During necropsy procedures, unprotected workers may be exposed to aerosols generated from cutting of tissue, bone, and carcasses, as well as from aerosolized portions of infectious liquids such as blood. For the purposes of determining the material available for release as aerosols, it is estimated that 50% of the blood volume will drain from the animal into the liquid effluent decontamination system. However, a portion of the remaining 50% may become aerosolized. Furthermore, as described in Section 4.3, the cutting of bone with power tools produces a significant amount of aerosolized particulate which can be inhaled. For the purposes of modeling the aerosol MAR in the necropsy room, the aerosolized release fraction (ARF) (1 \u00d7 10 -4) of 50% of the blood volume of the animals was summed with ten times the ARF times 1% of the average NiV or HeV concentrations in the tissue. One percent of the tissue is estimated to be exposed to cutting and of that 1%, ten times the ARF (10 \u00d7 10 -4 = 10-3) of this material is estimated to be aerosolized. The aerosol MAR for the necropsy room is summarized in the following equations: ! !! ! \" \u0019 ! \" ! Equation 9.7.2-1 ! !! \" \u0019 \" ! Equation 9.7.2-2 The infectious levels (i.e., concentrations of NiV and HeV) in the blood and in the tissue were determined by averaging measured values published in literature. For the concentrations of NiV and HeV in blood, the average values measured in whole blood, serum, and plasma was calculated [Berhane et al., 2006; Geisbert et al., 2010; Guillaume et 2010; Mathieu et al., 2011; Rockx et al., 2011; Williamson et al., 1998, 2000]. For the concentration of NiV and HeV in tissue, an ove rall average of the NiV and Hev concentrations in all tissues was calculated [Georges-Courbot et al., 2006; Guillaume et al., 2004b, al., al., al., 2010, 2011; Weingartl et al., 2005; Williamson et al., 1998, 2000]. No attempt was made to weight the average viral concentrations in tissue by the average mass of each organ. The NiV and HeV virus concentration distribution in blood and tissue for animals is presented in Table 9.7.2-2. (For the log PFU/g values, any measurement of 0 PFU or 0 TCID was set to a log value of -2, equivalent to 0.01 PFU.) 666 Table 9.7.2 -3: Aerosolized Tissue in ABSL Viral Conc.

Similarly, the average blood volume and number of type of each animal was used to determine the aerosol MAR contribution from the aerosolized blood. The details behind each of these subsets of aerosol contributions for the ABSL-4 necropsy room are listed in Tables 9.7.2- 3 and 9.7.2- 4. The MARs per necropsy day for the aerosol pathway in the necropsy room are listed in Table 9.7.2-5. These values were calculated by using the distributions of the viral concentrations in tissue and blood presented in Table 9.7.2- 2. 667 Table 9.7.2 -5: 10-2 \u00d7 101 3.50 \u00d7 -6: Liquid MAR in ABSL -4 necropsy room Mean Viral Conc. in Blood Average #Animals per Liquid Waste Viral Conc.

The pathogen source terms for the liquid waste pathway in the ABSL-4 necropsy room were set to 50% of the blood volume of the animals, as described in Section 4.3 for the FMDv assessment. The blood volumes, viral concentration distributions in the blood, and average number of animals that go through the necropsy room during a necropsy day were used to calculate the liquid waste MAR (Table 9.7.2-6). 9.7.2.4 Solid Waste - Necropsy The primary source of infectious material that is sterilized via the solid waste pathway in the ABSL- 4 necropsy room is the infected animals their tissues and carcasses. The MAR for the solid waste pathway in the necropsy room were derived from the mean NiV and HeV viral concentrations in the tissue (see Section 9.7.2.2 for details on how this viral concentration distribution was determined). As necropsies are only performed at the end of a study, for the purposes of modeling, tissues and carcasses from all animals in a single study were assumed to be processed (i.e., sterilized) as a batch. In other words, each autoclave run would consist of all infectious material (i.e., infectious tissue in the carcasses 668 Tab le 9.7.2-7: Solid W aste Co ntributions i n ABS L-4 Necropsy Ro om (per Study ) Species Mean Viral Conc. in Tissue (PFU/g) Anim al Mass (kg) # Animals Per Year Mass Per Year (kg) Viral Qty. in Tissue per Year Cattle 1.08 \u00d7 101 454 22 9979 1.08 \u00d7 108 Horse 454 22 9979 1.08 \u00d7 108 Sheep 34 52 1769 1.91 \u00d7 107 Pig 34 52 1769 1.91 \u00d7 107 Average Per Study 158.8 7.4 1175 1.27 \u00d7 107 Tab le 9.7.2-8: Solid aste Co ntributions i n ABS L-4 Necropsy Ro om (per Necropsy Da y) Species Mean Viral Conc. in Tissue (PFU/g) Anim al Mass (kg) # Animals Per Necropsy Day Mass Per Necropsy Day (kg) Viral Qty. in Tissue per Necropsy Day Cattle 1.08 \u00d7 Sheep Pig 2.95 468.7 5.07 \u00d7 106 Updated SSRA of the animals) produced in an average study. The ABSL-4 necropsy room is equipped with freezer space capable of storing animals prior to sterilization. In the BSL-3Ag necropsy room, it is assumed that tissues and carcasses are disposed of once per week; similarly, in the ABSL-4 necropsy room it is assumed that tissues and carcasses are disposed of after completion of the study. As it is estimated that there will be 20 large animal studies in the ABSL-4 per year, animal tissue and carcasses will be processed 20 times per year. Each animal study averages approximately 2590 lbs (1175 kg), which falls well within the maximum process capability of the tissue autoclave per week of ~10,500 lbs. The values used to determine the solid waste contributions of viral concentrations in the necropsy room are listed in Table 9.7.2- 7. Solid (Red Bag) Waste (L4NSW) Of t he infectious material produced per study in the ABSL-4 necropsy room, it is estimated that 20% of the tissue and carcass waste will be transferred to disposable solid material such as towels, disposable tools, containers, etc., and this material will be sterilized through two autoclaves in biohazard red bags and then incinerated. The solid red bag waste is expected to be processed on each necropsy day as opposed to at the end of each study. The infectious solid waste generated per necropsy day is listed in Table 9.7.2-8. The MAR in this solid (red bag) waste pathway is listed in Table 9.7.2- 9. 669 Table 9.7.2 -9: Solid (Red Bag) Waste MARs from ABSL -4 Necropsy Room Viral Qty. in Tissue Per Viral Qty. in Red Bag Waste Per Necropsy Day Necropsy Day Low 7.34 \u00d7 100 1.47 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 1012 Table Carcass Waste from ABSL -4 Necropsy Room Tissue/Carcass Infectious Solid Waste (P FU/Study) Low 1.47 \u00d7 101 Medium High 1.02 \u00d7 107 7.01 \u00d7 1012 Updated SSRA Solid Waste (Tissue and Carcasses) (L4NST) The re maining 80% of the infectious tissue and carcass waste is assumed to be sterilized in the tissue autoclave and then incinerated. The MAR in this solid waste (tissue and carcass) pathway is listed in Table 9.7.2-10. These values are the contributions from the average number of animals per study. 9.7.2.5 Transference - Necropsy Transference (Respiratory through Suit Leak) (L4NTRs) A potential transference event in the necropsy room is a respiratory exposure due to a leak in the BSL- 4 suit. The small leak may not be noticed immediately and this respiratory exposure was estimated to occur over a full day in the necropsy room. The MARs for this set of circumstances is the infectious aerosols produced during a necropsy day and detailed in Table 9.7.2-5. The respiratory MARs for the necropsy room are shown in Table 9.7.2- E Encapsulated Positive Pressure BSL- \u0011 -4 suit, some positive pressure, and thus protection, is maintained.] 670 Table 9.7.2 -11: Respiratory MARs 10-2 \u00d7 101 3.50 \u00d7 -12: Transference MAR for ABSL -4 Ne cropsy Room Viral Conc. in Mass Available % Transferred % Injected from Injected Tissue (PFU/g) for Transfer (g) from Tissue to Tool Tool into Cut Fraction (PFU) Low 1.57 \u00d7 10-5 Updated SSRA Transference (Injection from Cut with Tool) (L4NTI) Ano ther potential transference event in the necropsy room is one in which the researcher accidentally cuts their PPE suit and the tool cuts through the skin barrier resulting in a laboratory injection. The source terms for such circumstances were assumed to be 1 g of infectious tissue, of which 40% is transferred to the tool, and then 100% of this transferred material is injected into the cut. The MAR for this transference injection pathway is shown in Table 9.7.2- 12. Transference (Contact with Palm through Cut PPE) (L4NTCp) In t he event that the PPE suit is cut in the necropsy room, the tool may not cut through the exposed skin, but rather may come into contact with skin resulting in a transference contact event. In these modeled events, the source terms were also assumed to be 1 g of infectious tissue, of which 40% is transferred to the tool, and then another 40% is transferred onto the palm. The MAR for this transference contact pathway is shown in Table 9.7.2-13. (Without the final transfer to the palm, the MAR is the same as that for the transference injection pathway as shown in Table 9.7.2-12.) 671 Table 9.7.2 -13: Transference Palm Contact MAR for ABSL -4 Necropsy Room Viral Conc. in Mas s Available % Transferred % Transferred Injected Tissue (PFU/g) for Transfer (g) from Tissue to Tool from Tool to Palm Fraction (PFU) Low 1.57 \u00d7 MAR for ABSL -4 Necropsy Room Viral Conc. in Tissue Mass Injected Fraction (PFU/g) Transferred (g) (PFU) Low 1.57 \u00d7 10-5 \u00d7 Updated SSRA Transference (Contact with Fomite) (L4NTCf) The last modeled set of circumstances in the ABSL-4 necropsy room is a fomite contact transference pathway. In these events, an infectious sample from the necropsy room (e.g., tissue sample) is being shipped to another BSL-4 laboratory for further analysis. In the packaging of the sample, infectious material contaminates the outer surface of the package (i.e., the fomite). The source terms were set 1 g of infectious tissue all over the surface of the package; the MAR for this set of events is listed in Table 9.7.2- 14. 672 Updated SSRA 9.8 Event Analyses Based on the activities and experiments to be performed in the ABSL-4 AHR and necropsy laboratories in the NBAF, a total of sixteen circumstances were modeled that can result in a release of infectious material via the four pathways. These sixteen circumstances were solely developed around activities that are unique to handling and working with large animals (e.g., cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs) in a BSL-4 environment. Further, critical feedback from subject matter experts was used to refine these situations based on their concerns on working with large animals and BSL-4 agents [November ABSL- 4 Assessment SME Solicitation meeting]. The sixteen situations were detailed in Table 9.6.1- 1. A summary of all of the nodes, the probability of failure, the reduction factor when the mitigating system is functional, and the reduction factor upon failure is listed in Table 9.8-1. The probability of human error was set to 5 \u00d7 10-3 based on human reliability assessments for highly reliable and trained workers such as those to be employed at the NBAF [Spurgin, 2009]. This failure rate was used for any mitigating systems or event nodes that were dependent upon a worker performing the action. System failure rates were set to 1 \u00d7 10-5 [SSRA, 2010]. Additional assumptions to the failure rates and transfer percentages are noted in Table 9.8- 1. The detailed accident sequences that resulted in the release of infectious material for each of these circumstances are included the following sections. For each circumstance, each event node or mitigating (i.e., protection) system is included, along with their modeled probability of failure, reduction factor of the viral quantity when the mitigating system or node is functional, and the reduction factor when the mitigating system or node fails. The opportunity rate (i.e., how often such circumstances could occur based on the use and frequency of the AHRs and necropsy room per year, Ro) is also presented for each circumstance. Each unique detailed accident sequence creates an event under the circumstances and the probability for these specific loss- of-containment events occurring ( PLoss), the overall reduction factor along with the Q value (quantity released at this point in the event), and frequency of loss- of\u00ad containment ( FLoss) are presented. Equation 9.8-1 The probability is the produc and the overall reduction is similarly the product of the reduction factors for each node based on its state. The frequency of loss- of-containment (number of times per year) is the product of the opportunity rate and the probability of loss- of-containment. In addition to the table for each set of circumstances indicating which nodes or mitigating system is functional or had failed along with the relevant information for each event, an event tree is also presented. 673 Updated SSRA 6 74 Table 9.8 -1: Summary of Mitigating Systems and Nodes - Reduction Factors and Probabilities Reduction Reduction Originating Probability Factor Factor Pathway(s) Location(s) Node/Mitigation System of Failure (Success) (Failure) Notes Syringe is not dropped when 10 times human error rate due to animal not Aerosol AHR researcher is physically displaced by 5.00E -02 n/a n/a being restrained unrestrained animals 2 times human error rate (error in sedating Aerosol, Animal is properly sedated and AHR 1.00E -02 n/a n/a animal + error in performing experiment when Transference inoc ulation occurs while sedated animal not sedated) Aerosol, Human error rate (5 \u00d7 1 0-3) to appropriately AHR Squeeze chute (animal restraints) 5.00E -03 n/a n/a Transference restrain animals Aerosol, Syringe maintains containment Syringe is naturally open container, 10% of the AHR 1.00E -01 0.00E+00 1.00E+00 Transference when dropped time all the material will be released Source decontaminatio n at (12) 12 drains = 2 AHRs in use, 6 trench drains per Liquid AHR 5.84E -02 1.00E -01 1.77E -01 drain pipes (AHR) AHR, 2 outlets per drain AHR, Liquid Cook tank 1.00E -05 1.00E -06 1.00E+00 Systems failure ator 1.00E n/a Necropsy Updated SSRA 675 Table 9.8 -1: Summary of Mitigating Systems and Nodes - Reduction Factors and Probabilities Reduction Reduction Originating Probability Factor Factor Pathway(s) Location(s) Node/Mitigation System of Failure (Success) (Failure) Notes Liquid Necropsy 5.36E -02 1.00E -03 1.00E 1.00E -05 n/a n/a Systems failure rate indicator Systems failure rate for incinerator multiplied by AHR, Solid Incinerator 1.00E -10 1.00E -09 1.00E+00 systems failure rate for built -in redundant and Necropsy orthogonal performance indicator Human error rate (5 \u00d7 10-3) to fail to correctly Transference AHR Penning of animals 5.00E -03 n/a n/a latch pens Assumes 10% of material from animal is Transference AHR PPE protects skin barrier 5.00E -01 0.00E+00 1.00E -01 injected; 50% of the time PPE is cut by animal, skin barrier is broken PPE suit hose does not become Assumes 5.7% of aerosol material is inhaled Transference AHR entangled or disconnected due to 5.00E -01 6.70E -06 5.70E -02 into rogue animal Updated SSRA 676 Table 9.8 -1: Summary of Mitigating Systems and Nodes - Reduction Factors and Probabilities Reduction Reduction Originating Probability Factor Factor Pa thway(s) Location(s) Node/Mitigation System of Failure (Success) (Failure) Notes PPE suit protect against skin barrier Assumes 5% of material is injected from Tra nsference AHR being broken when PPE suit has 5.00E -01 n/a 5.00E -02 inoculum; 50% of the time PPE is stabbed, skin been stabbed with syringe barrier is broken Researcher does not stab through 10 times human error rate (given animal has Tra nsference AHR PPE suit given physical displacement 5.00E -02 n/a n/a displaced researcher) from unrestrained an imal 2 times human error rate (twice as likely to cut Tra nsference AHR Suit is not cut by rogue animal 1.00E -02 n/a n/a suit than walking around normally) 2 times human error rate (twice as likely to cut Tra nsference AHR Suit is not cut by rogue animal 1.00E -02 n/a n/a suit than walking around normally) Tra nsference AHR Suit is not torn while moving in AHR 5.00E -03 6.70E -06 1.00E -03 Human error rate (5 10-3) AHR, Appropriate medical response to an Tra nsferenc e 5.00E -03 n/a n/a Human exposure AHR, Tra nsference BSL-4 1.00E -03 Necropsy AHR, BSL-4 or to Tra nsference 5.00E -03 n/a n/a Updated SSRA 677 Table 9.8 -1: Summary of Mitigating Systems and Nodes - Reduction Factors and Probabilities Reduction Reduction Originating Probability Factor Factor Pathway(s) Location(s) Node/Mitigation System of Failure (Success) (Failure) Notes AHR, T ransference Laboratory exposure is reported 5.00E -03 n/a treatment 5.00E rate (5 \u00d7 10-3) Assumes 100% of material is injected from Cut through PPE suit does not break T ransference Necropsy 5.00E -01 0.00E+00 1.00E+00 cutting self with tool; 50% of the time PPE is the skin barrier cut, skin barrier is broken Cut through PPE suit does not result 100% of the time, after cutting PPE gear, there T ransference Necropsy 1.00E+00 0.00E+00 4.00E -01 in contact rate (5 \u00d7 PPE suit T ransference -03 procedures Updated SSRA 9.8.1 Animal Holding Room Events 9.8.1.1 AHR - Aerosol Release Through Dropped Inoculum (L4AAi) In this situation, the researcher enters the ABSL-4 AHR preparing to inoculate the animals. Prior to inoculation, the animals should be sedated and restrained in the squeeze chute (per NBAF proposed protocol). However, the researcher may have failed to sedate the animal completely, or enters the AHR before the animals are sedated or after the sedation has worn off. In such a situation, if the researcher failed to appropriately restrain the animals, the animal may physically displace the researcher resulting in the inoculum syringe being dropped, breaking, and releasing an aerosolized portion of the inoculum into the room. In this set of circumstances, there are four nodes prior to the HEPA filters: 1) failure to sedate the animals; 2) failure to appropriately restrain the animals in the squeeze chute; 3) failure to hold the syringe upon being physically displaced; and 4) the syringe container failing. If all four of these nodes fail, then there will be an aerosolized release which will be mitigated by the operational state of the HEPA filters. Figure 9.8.1-1: Conceptual Diagram of the HEPA Filtration Events for Aerosol Releases The same ten events associated with HEPA filters are used as presented in Section 4 for the BSL- 3 laboratories. The ten release events through the HEPA filters are show in Figure 9.8.2-1 along with their reduction factors on top and probability of the event on the bottom. The HEPA filters reduce the quantity of viral material. For the parallel double-caisson arrangement, the HEPA filters can be fully functional (green), degraded (yellow), in a recognized fault state such that air flow is blocked (pink with an X), or in an unrecognized fault state in which unfiltered air is being let through (pink without an X). The original material available for release is the aerosolized release portion of the inoculum in a single syringe. The opportunity rate for this set of circumstances is 148 yr-1, corresponding to the average 678 Updated SSRA number of animals to be in the AHRs over the course of a year, as each animal presents a single opportunity for release upon its inoculation. T The probabilities ( PLoss), reduction factors, Q values, and frequencies of loss- of-containment ( FLoss) for the events included in this set of circumstances are detailed in Table 9.8.1-1. The event tree is shown in Figure 9.8.1-2. (The event tree has four events which are not modeled, events in which one HEPA filter caisson fails with a shutdown failure releasing unfiltered air and the other HEPA filter caisson is operational. As discussed in more detail in Section 4.5, these events were considered but not modeled as the pressure transducers on the operational HEPA filter caisson would likely indicate a fault in the overall HEPA filter shutting down the system.)

The same ten events associated with HEPA filters are used as presented in Section 4 for the BSL-3 laboratories and as presented in Section 9.8.1.1. The HEPA filters reduce the quantity of viral material and the material available for release is the viral concentration shredded per day in each AHR. (As data for the respiratory shedding levels of NiV and HeV from animals could not be found, the levels of FMDv were used to calculate the MAR.) The opportunity rate for this set of circumstances is 588 yr-1 , corresponding to the number of infectious days in the AHRs (294 infectious days each of the two AHRs). The probabilities ( PLoss), reduction factors, Q values, and frequencies of loss- of-containment ( FLoss) for the events included in this set of circumstances are detailed in Table 9.8.1-2.

The urine and feces excreted from the animals are drained through pipes which are primed with a chemical disinfectant. The liquid waste is then combined with other liquid waste streams, decontaminated in a cook tank and the cook tank performance verified prior to release to the on-site wastewater treatment plant. The mitigating nodes are the priming of the drain pipes, the cook tank, the redundant and orthogonal cook tank performance indicator, and the wastewater treatment plant. As there are 12 total drains which need to be primed in the animal holding rooms each with an independent failure rate of 5 \u00d7 10 -3 (human error rate), an overall probability of failing to prime the drains was calculated. Failure to prime the drains was defined as failing to prime any number (1 12) of drains ( PPRIME ) by the following equations: Equation 9.8.1 -1 where Equation 9.8.1-2 !

The MAR is 20% of the liquid waste generated in the AHRs and transferred to disposable solid materials (e.g., PPE, towels). The opportunity rate for this set of circumstances is 294 yr-1, corresponding to the number of infectious days in the AHRs as the solid waste from the two rooms is combined and autoclaved on a daily basis. The probabilities ( PLoss), reduction factors, Q values, and frequencies of loss- of-containment ( FLoss) for the events included in this set of circumstances are detailed in Table 9.8.1-4.

Prior to inoculation, the animals should be sedated and restrained in the squeeze chute. However, the researcher may have failed to sedate the animals or enters the AHR before the animals are sedated or after the sedation has worn off. In such a situation, if the researcher failed to appropriately restrain the animals, the animal may physically displace the researcher resulting in the inoculum syringe stabbing through the BSL-4 suit (PPE). If the BSL-4 suit does not protect the researcher, then the researcher may accidentally stab themselves and inject a fraction of the inoculum. For there to be a transference injection release, there must be a failure in the following four nodes: 1) failure to sedate the animals; 2) failure to appropriately restrain the animals in the squeeze chute; 3) failure to not stab themselves, specifically the BSL-4 suit; and 4) failure for the BSL-4 suit to protect against an injection. If there is an injection, the researcher must report the laboratory exposure and the appropriate medical response must be initiated. If the laboratory exposure is not reported, there will not be a medical response. In such an event, it is assumed that a single drop of 50 \u00b5L from a 1 mL volume of inoculum was injected (5% transferred). The MAR is the full 1 mL volume of inoculum. The opportunity rate for this set of circumstances is 148 yr-1, corresponding to the average number of animals to be in the AHRs over the course of a year, as each animal presents a single opportunity for release upon its inoculation. The probabilities ( PLoss), reduction factors, Q values, and frequencies of loss- of-containment ( FLoss) for the events included in this set of circumstances are detailed in Table 9.8.1-5.

For there to be an uncontrolled animal, there has to be a failure to restrain the animals in the squeeze chute and a failure to pen the animals (e.g., gate is left unlatched). Next, the animal must either directly (e.g., cut, bite) or indirectly (e.g., suit gets torn on the penning) cause a severe cut in the positive-pressure suit and cause the hose to become entangled or disconnected from the suit. The severe cut will result in loss of positive pressure and the hose entanglement results in the lack of air flow around the respiratory region of the researcher. For this respiratory transference event, there must be a failure in the following four nodes: 1) failure to appropriately restrain the animals in the squeeze chute; 2) failure of the penning; 3) severe cut in the BSL-4 suit; and 4) hose entanglement. If there is a respiratory exposure, the researcher must report the laboratory exposure and the appropriate medical response must be initiated. If the laboratory exposure is not reported, there will not be a medical response. In such an event, it is assumed that 5.7% of the aerosol levels in the room will be transferred to the D ! concentration shredded per 30 min in the AHRs as it is assumed that the exposure will not last for longer than 30 minutes. (As data for the respiratory shedding levels of NiV and HeV virus from animals could not be found, the levels of FMDv were used to calculate the MAR.). The opportunity rate for this set of circumstances is 14,112 yr-1, corresponding to 294 infectious days per AHR, two AHRs, two handlers dealing with four animals each in the morning per AHR, two handlers dealing with four animals each in the evening per AHR, and one researcher dealing with eight animals per AHR. The probabilities ( PLoss), reduction factors, Q values, and frequencies of loss- of-containment ( FLoss) for the events included in this set of circumstances are detailed in Table 9.8.1-6.

The rogue animal bites, kicks, or cuts the individual resulting in a transference injection event. For there to be a rogue animal, there has to be a failure to restrain the animals in the squeeze chute and a failure to pen the animals (e.g., gate is left unlatched). Next, the rogue animal must cut the BSL-4 suit (PPE) and the BSL-4 suit must not protect against the cut or bite breaking the skin barrier. For this injection transference event, there must be a failure in the following four nodes: 1) failure to appropriately restrain the animals in the squeeze chute; 2) failure of the penning; 3) cut through the PPE; and 4) PPE fails to protect against the cut or bite breaking the skin barrier. If there is a laboratory exposure, the researcher must report the exposure and the appropriate medical response must be initiated. If the laboratory exposure is not reported, there will not be a medical response. In such an event, it is assumed that 10% of one gram of the infectious material present in the oral/nasal region of an infected animal will be injected into the researcher through the bite. The opportunity rate for this set of circumstances is 14,112 yr-1, corresponding to 294 infectious days per AHR, two AHRs, two handlers dealing with four animals each in the morning per AHR, two handlers dealing with four animals each in the evening per AHR, and one researcher dealing with eight animals per AHR.

These set of circumstances has five nodes: 1) failure to test the BSL-4 suit prior to entry; 2) probability of suit having a leak (dependent upon not testing the suit); 3) probability of tearing a small hole in the suit; 4) reporting the respiratory exposure; and 5) appropriate medical response (dependent upon reporting the exposur e). In such an event, it is assumed that 5.7% of the aerosol levels in the room will be transferred to the D ! concentration shed per 4 hours in the AHRs as it is assumed that the exposure may not be recognized for some period due to its small size. (As data for the respiratory shedding levels of NiV and HeV from animals could not be found, the levels of FMDv were used to calculate the MAR.). The opportunity rate for this set of circumstances is 2,940 yr -1, corresponding to 294 infectious days per AHR, two AHRs, two handlers entering the room in the morning per AHR, two handlers entering the room in the evening per AHR, and one researcher entering the room per day per AHR.

This infectious aerosol is mitigated by the HEPA filters and the same ten events associated with HEPA filters are used as presented in Section 4 for the BSL-3 laboratories and as presented in Section 9.8.1 apply for the ABSL-4 necropsy room. The event MAR is 10 times the aerosolized release portion of 1% of the tissue MAR, plus the aerosolized release portion of 50% of the blood MAR. The opportunity rate for this set of circumstances is 50.13 yr -1, corresponding to the average number of necropsy days in a year.

During necropsy, a fraction of the liquid waste (e.g., blood) is drained through pipes which are primed with a chemical disinfectant. The liquid waste is then combined with other liquid waste streams and decontaminated in a cook tank and the cook tank performance verified prior to the contents being released and subjected to the on-site wastewater treatment. The four mitigating nodes are the priming of the drain pipes, the cook tank, the redundant and orthogonal cook tank performance indicator, and the wastewater treatment plant. As there are 11 total drains which need to be primed in the animal holding rooms each with an independent failure rate of 5 \u00d7 10 -3 (human error rate), an overall probability of failing to prime the drains was calculated. Failure to prime the drains was defined as failing to prime any number (1 11) of drains ( PPRIME ) by the following equations: Equation 9.8. 2-1 where Equation 9.8.2-2 !

In such an event, it is assumed that 5.7% of the aerosol levels in the room will be transferred to the D ! concentrations from the cut tissue and aerosolized portion of the blood during a necropsy day.

These set of circumstances have four nodes: 1) the researcher cutting through the PPE suit; 2) the cut going through the skin of the researcher; 3) reporting the laboratory injection exposure; and 4) appropriate medical response (dependent upon reporting the exposure). In such an event, it is assumed that 100% of the material on the tool would be transferred into the person. The amount of material available was estimated to be 1 g of which 40% was transferred to the tool. The original MAR is the average concentration of NiV and HeV in 1 g of tissue. The opportunity rate for this set of circumstances is 14,789 yr-1, which was calculating the product of the number of necropsy days per day (50.13), the number of researchers performing necropsy (2), the average number of animals processed per necropsy day (2.95), and an average of 50 cuts per researcher per animal. The probabilities ( PLoss), reduction factors, Q values, and frequencies of loss- of-containment ( FLoss) for the events included in this set of circumstances are detailed in Table 9.8.2-6.

In this specific set of circumstances, the researcher accidentally cuts through the PPE suit but the skin barrier is not broken, yet there is a contact event. Upon contact, the researcher may or may not report the exposure. If the exposure is reported (i.e., the researcher is aware of the contact) and the proper medical response is received, they will undergo a chemical spot treatment and two soap and water body showers prior to leaving containment at a time deemed appropriate by the medical responders. If there is a failed medical response, it is assumed that the researcher, being aware of the contact exposure, will perform a chemical spot disinfection and will go through two body showers prior to leaving containment (one between the BSL-4 and the BSL-3E, and one to leave BSL-3E containment). If the exposure is not reported, it is assumed that the researcher is not aware of the potential risks with the contact exposure and no chemical spot treatment will be performed. Without any awareness, the researcher may or may not go through the two body showers prior to leaving containment.

During the packaging, infectious material may be transferred to the outer surface of the container and could result in a fomite transference event. All samples to be shipped from the BSL-4 will go through the chemical shower and then be disinfected in a chemical dunk tank to leave the BSL-4 into the BSL-3E. To exit the BSL-3E, the sample will go through two more dunk tank disinfections. Each of these nodes reduces the quantity of material depending on their success or failure. The MAR is derived from 1 g of infectious tissue (average of NiV and HeV concentrations in tissue) which is spread out on the surface of the outer container. The opportunity rate for this set of circumstances is 148 yr -1, estimating that one sample will be sent out of the BSL-4 of the NBAF to another BSL- 4 laboratory.

First a review of documented outbreaks of HeV and NiV was conducted to: identify and present known impacts of an outbreak (including the metric); understand key factors that influence transmission of the disease; and estimate the potential impact of reservoir hosts to the persistence of HeV or NiV within a geographic region. The second phase focused on extrapolation of the historical data in conjunction with review of the source terms determined in the event analysis to apply to and identify the key factors necessary to estimate an outbreak impact relevant to the Manhattan, Kansas location of the NBAF. The two main paramyxoviruses to be studied at the NBAF, HeV and NiV, have caused sporadic outbreaks in domestic animals and people, with high case-fatality rates, and evidence of human-to human transmission for NiV [Plowright, 2011]. 9.9.1 The Historical Perspective The first cases of HeV and NiV were identified in 1994 and 1998, respectively; both are considered (relatively) recently emerged pathogens. Research is just beginning to characterize the transmission, stability, and pathogenesis of these agents thus the need for containment facilities such as the NBAF that may perform research on them. Sufficient data do not yet exist that lends them to full epidemiological or economic modeling to understand the impact that an outbreak of these pathogens may have in the United States (specifically Manhattan, Kansas). Data do exist, however, on the impact that outbreaks of these pathogens have had in other parts of the world such as Malaysia, Bangladesh, Singapore and Australia. Although the human demographics, distribution of host and reservoir species, farming practices and medical and veterinary response dynamics, do differ significantly in Kansas from these known outbreak location, they currently offer the best available information by which to estimate the kind of impact an outbreak in Kansas may have and thus are presented here. 9.9.1.1 Summary of HeV and NiV Outbreak Impact The two paramyxoviruses to be studied at the NBAF, HeV and NiV, have caused sporadic outbreaks in domestic animals and people, with high case-fatality rates, and evidence of human-to human transmission for NiV [Plowright, 2011]. The following summaries of these outbreaks provide a perspective regarding the impact of the outbreaks in terms of the resulting number of human and susceptible animal infections and fatalities. Hendra virus was first identified in Australia during an outbreak involving humans and horses for which the disease is lethal. All reported HeV outbreaks thus far have been confined to Australia. As of this writing, there have been thirty reported outbreaks of HeV in Australia all outbreaks involved transmission of virus from flying foxes to a primary case horse. Five events led to transmission from horses to humans [Plowright, 2011]. A summary of the HeV outbreaks reported as of August 2001 are provided in Table 9.9.1-1. Note that overall, each outbreak resulted in on average less than 1 human infection (0.23), with an average case fatality rate of 57% and an average ~2 horse infections (all of which were ultimately euthanized if they did not succumb to the disease first). 729 Updated SSRA Table 9.9.1 -1: Impact of the Hendra Outbreaks (Adapted from Plowright [2011] and Pallister [2011]) # Infected Location Month, Year Humans (% Fatalities) Horses Mackay Aug. 1994 1 (100) 2 20 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 3 3 3a 1 1 1 2 3 (+1 Dog) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2.13 \u00b1 3.51 Brisbane (HeV) Sept. 1994 2 (50) Cairns (Trinity Beach) Jan. 1999 0 Cairns (Gordonvale) Oct. 2004 1 (0) Townsville Dec. 2004 0 Peachester June 2006 0 Murwillumbah Oct. 2006 0 Peachester June 2007 0 Cairns (Clifton Beach) July 2007 0 Brisbane (Redlands) July 2008 2 (50%) Proserpine July 2008 0 Rockhampton July 2008 1 (100 %) Bowen Sept. 2009 0 Tewantin May 2010 0 Logan Reserve June 2011 0 Kerry June 2011 0 McLeans Ridge June 2011 0 Mt.

Evidence suggests that transmission of the virus from horses to people, albeit rare, occurs through physical contact with nasal and oral secretions from sick, dying or recently expired infected horses [Hanna, 2006]. Of the four persons known to be infected with HeV between 1994-2007; all were subject to direct exposure to secretions or tissues from ill, dying or recently expired horses, and two were directly involved in autopsies where they experienced heavy contamination (one veterinarian reported using no PPE). Two of the four died, and the remaining two suffered a relatively minor form of the illness 730 Updated SSRA [Hanna 2006].During the July 2008 Brisbane HeV outbreak; two horses were quarantined at a veterinary clinic after suspicion of HeV infection, which resulted in the subsequent transmission to three other horses (all of which either died or were euthanized). Two veterinary workers (equine veterinarian and a veterinary nurse) associated with this outbreak became ill, resulting in one death [Playford, 2010] see Table 9.9-1.Interestingly, during this July 2008 HeV outbreak, the known contacts with infected horses (83 persons) and infected humans (9 healthcare workers and domestic contacts) were assessed and none developed symptoms or expressed antibodies against the virus when tested (beyond the two human index cases discussed previously). Included among these contacts was one veterinary worker who suffered a direct percutaneous blood exposure during euthanasia on an HeV-infected horse. As a precaution, this person was treated with antiviral ribavirin and never showed indication of HeV infection. Even when exposed during high-risk procedures, the infection rate for HeV during this outbreak was relatively low (7%) when the appropriate respiratory droplet and mucosal protection precautions were taken [Playford, 2010]. The high-risk activities that did lead to the two infected patients included performing daily nasal cavity lavage on an infected horse and participation in a necropsy of an infected horse. Roughly half (16/30) of the reported HeV outbreaks presented in Table 9.9.1-1 have occurred in 2011, none of which resulted in any human infections (presumably associated with increased awareness, knowledge of and adherence to, proper handling of infected animals and animal products gained since the first outbreaks in 1994) but did result in one to three horse infections per outbreak. The Mt. Alford outbreak included the only confirmed HeV infection in a dog. Other than this event, HeV had exclusively been isolated from bats, humans and horses in nature [Pallister 2011] although laboratory exposures have indicated the ability of HeV to replicate in other mammalian hosts. Human Niv infection was first recognized during a large outbreak in peninsular Malaysia and Singapore where it was isolated from a patient within the Sungai NiV village during this outbreak which occurred from September 1998 to June 1999 [Luby, 2009]. In Malaysia, infected reservoir bats were suspected to have transmitted the virus to pigs resulting in a swine epidemic, spread through the movement (sale) of animals, and leading to a human epidemic (from exposure to infected pigs and in some instances infected persons). The Malaysia outbreak was controlled when infections were identified and direct contact with infected pigs (and presumably persons) was ceased. This case study indicated that when infections are identified, culling infected animals, exercising the appropriate level of PPE precaution and/or avoiding contact with infected animals altogether, and ceasing movement of infected animals were successful at controlling the further spread of disease. Even with the fairly rapid identification of index NiV cases, the Malaysia outbreak resulted in over 265 reported human cases, with 105 deaths and the culling of more than one million pigs followed by a 3 month active surveillance program as presented in Table 9.9.1-2 [Chua, 2003; Luby, 2009]. The Malaysia outbreak had a high case fatality rate (~40%), a high rate of symptomatic infection (data not reported) and an infection rate in pigs near 100% [Chua, 2003; Sahani 2001]. It was not until approximately 2.5 years after the onset of the outbreak that Malaysia was declared free of NiV in the livestock population by OIE (occurred in June 2001). 731 Updated SSRA 732 Table 9.9.1 -2: Summary of 1998 -2001 NiV Outbreak Impacts # Humans % # Animals Culled Outbreak Infected Fatalities (Porcine) Comments Reference(s) >1 million (porcine); Malaysia declared free of NiV virus in the Chua, 2003; - 1998 1999 40% a and 3 month livestock population in June 2001 by OIE.

In contrast to the Malaysia and Singapore NiV outbreaks, the vast majority of case patients in the Bangladesh outbreaks did not have any contact with infected pigs or pig excrement. This was reportedly due to the fact that many of the Bangladesh population are practicing Muslims who do not consume pork or physically contact pigs [Montgomery, 2008]. The majority of the reported index cases in the Bangladesh NiV outbreaks were linked not to contact with infected pigs, but with ingestion of NiV containing fresh date palm sap. In Bangladesh, P. giganteus bats reportedly lick the sap during collection and transmit the virus followed by a customary drinking of the raw palm sap. In other cases, direct contact with NiV infected bat secretions was the attributed cause of the exposures [Luby 2009]. The impact in the Bangladesh outbreaks was therefore limited to human illness and death; as opposed to the additional economic impact to the pig farming industry observed in the Malaysian NiV outbreak. In Siliguri, West Bengal India, between 31 January and 23 February, 2001 a total of 92 probable NiV cases and 67 subsequent deaths were reported [Chadha, 2006; 9.9.1-2). A single patient admitted to the local Male Medical Ward in January 2001 is the suspected source of the outbreak which subsequently transmitted infection to other patients and visitors to the ward. Similar to the Bangladesh outbreaks, no concurrent illness in animals or exposure to among the residents, and led to the closure of private health facilities. Although difficult to quantify the impact in any specific metric, the closure of private health facilities would certainly lead to a significant economic impact (especially in developed nations) and increase in the number of infected patients that leading to subsequent transmission). In summary, the impact from any given reported HeV outbreak was limited in terms of the number of human infections, ranging from 1-2 human infections with a 57% fatality rate overall. For HeV outbreaks there were a greater potential for horse infections, ranging from 1 to 20 horses infected per outbreak, all of which were sacrificed regardless of whether or not they recovered from the illness. Although fewer persons and animals were reportedly impacted per outbreak for HeV (relative to NiV), the recurrence of spillover due to the established reservoir host in that area, continues to demand presumably significant resources to continually monitor and respond to the recurring events (16 of which have happened in June -August 2011 alone). In contrast to HeV, the majority of NiV outbreaks have led to far more human infections and fatalities, ranging from 3-265 (average of 41\u00b169) with high case fatality rates ranging from 10-100% (average of 80%). Only one of the reported NiV outbreaks (out of 14) affected the livestock industry, however when it did affect livestock the impact was significant leading to the culling of over one million pigs followed by additional resources expended to perform active surveillance until the OIE declared the area NiV-free. 733 Updated SSRA 9.9.1.2 Documented Outbreak Transmission Factors Due to the high sequence homology, similar genome organization and other similar biological characteristics, both HeV and NiV have recently been placed in a newly characterized genus Henipaviurs [Wong, 2009]. Several disease transmission related similarities exist between the two pathogens. First, NiV and HeV share the same natural host reservoir as indicated by wildlife species surveillance studies, namely genus Pteropid fruit bats which inhabit northern Australia, southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and eastern Africa (but not the US) [Wong, 2009]. Specifically, island flying foxes ( vampyrus ) have been confirmed as the natural reservoir in Malaysian outbreaks. In these instances NiV has been confirmed within the urine and saliva of the bat reservoirs which then in turn contaminate animal and human food that when consumed provide a source of virus capable of causing infection [Lam, 2002]. Thus pig farms in proximity to fruit orchards and fruit trees that draw these bat species should be avoided, and their co-location should be considered a risk factor to the reintroduction of NiV into these pig populations. Additionally, ingestion of NiV contaminated fresh date palm sap ( P. giganteus bats reportedly lick the sap during collection and transmit the virus) or direct contact with bat secretions are specific documented modes of NiV ! Pteropus ) also exhibit an infectious period during which they excrete HeV in urine, saliva, feces and placental fluid [Plowright, 2011]. Transmission of HeV from flying foxes to horses is through horse ingestion of pasture, feed or water contaminated with the HeV bat secretions noted above [Plowright, 2011]. Increased human encroachment into bat habitats previously undisturbed (such as forests) has led to urbanization of flying foxes, reduction in flying fox migration patterns and an increase in the overlap of human, horse and flying ! coast cities and across many major towns where previously flying fox populations were not observed [Plowright, 2011]. The changes in flying fox ecology observed in Australia have been linked to the observations of more intense and lethal HeV outbreaks in both people and horses. As best stated by the risk of pathogen emergence from a reservoir host to a new host species is affected by 1) the number of reservoir hosts infected, 2) the encounter rate between reservoir and novel hosts and 3) the infection dynamics and transmission biology o f the pathogen Thirteen of the 14 evaluated HeV spill-over events were within foraging radius of continuously occupied (9) or seasonally occupied (4) urban flying fox camps [Plowright, 2011] which undoubtedly contributed to an increased encounter rate and possibly the number of reservoir hosts infected. The general pattern of transmission from bats to animals and infected animals to humans is similar for HeV and NiV; although HeV primarily affects horses while NiV primarily affects pigs. For HeV, evidence suggests that transmission of the virus from horses to people, albeit rare, occurs through physical contact with nasal and oral secretions from sick, dying or recently expired infected horses [Hanna, 2006]. Of the four persons known to be infected with HeV between 1994-2007; all were subject to direct exposure to secretions or tissues from ill, dying or recently expired horses, and two were directly involved in autopsies where they experienced heavy contamination (one veterinarian reported using no PPE). 734 Updated SSRA The Malaysian NiV outbreak indicated that NiV infections are spread from pig to man via infected bod y fluids through direct body contact as well as via respiratory droplets at close range [Kay-Sin, 1999]. The case study indicated that NiV caused disease with a high infection rate, affecting 33% of the household members of infected farms. Workers with direct contact with the sick animals (ear tagging, pig breeding, administering medication, etc.) were more likely to become infected (51%) as were family members of the infected (56%). Contact with live infected pigs (or close contact with infected persons) was key to the transmission. Pigs were the predominant agent of transmission of NiV from animal to man; however, according to Sahani [2001] infected dogs have also shown to transmit the virus. Other domestic species including cats, horses and goats were eff - 2002]. Infected pigs may be asymptomatic or only mildly affected. NiV infection was not rampant among abattoir workers in this outbreak only seven of 435 tested were antibody-positive and those workers were associated with locations of active pig farm infections and five of the seven reported contact with live pigs [Sahani, 2001]. The spread of the virus among pig farms within and between states of Peninsular Malaysia was due to movement of pigs [Chau, 2003], farms even in close proximity to infected farms that did not receive animals with suspected infection remained NiV free. Similar to HeV, transmission of NiV between animals within a farm was attributed to direct contact with infectious urine, saliva, pharyngeal and lung secretions [Chau, 2003]. Likely the most notable documented difference between the modes of transmission of NiV and HeV is evidence of person- to-person transmission of NiV that is lacking in HeV outbreaks [Plowright, 2011]. This is most clearly explained via a discussion of the NiV cases that occurred between 31 January and 23 February, 2001 in Siliguri, India [Harit, 2006]. A case admitted to the local Male Medical Ward in January 2001 is the suspected source of the outbreak which then transmitted infection to other patients and visitors to the ward. Similar to the Bangladesh outbreaks, no concurrent illness in animals or exposure to ill domestic animals was reported. This outbreak demonstrated ability to transmit NiV in hospital settings; however this particular case is unique in that regard. Other studies [Mounts, 2001] report that the risk of nosocomial infections of NiV was low even with reported unprotected exposures to potentially infected secretions of NiV patients, no transmission of NiV to these studied healthcare workers was reported. Given the variability in the reported instances of person- to-person transmission in hospital settings, the documented instances of NiV transmission to persons in close contact with and/or caring for the sick [Homaira, 2010], with the knowledge that NiV is found in various bodily secretions indicates at a minimum a potential of transmission of the virus to healthcare providers, proximal patients in a hospital setting or other persons in close contact with those infected with NiV and thus this impact must be considered and evaluated. If people are in contact with the infected towards the last days of illness when respiratory symptoms are present (i.e., coughing) it has been suggested that the probability of NiV transmission is amplified during these last stages of illness when respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing) are more prominent [Homaira, 2010]. It is likely that given the standard personal protective precautions exercised in the U.S. medical system when a respiratory infectious disease is suspected, that the risk of person to person transmission could be reduced below that which was observed during the Indian outbreak. However, in cases where the NiV infection has not yet been 735 Updated SSRA recognized, not reported, or has been misdiagnosed, the potential for person- to-person transmission of NiV still needs to be evaluated. 9.9.2 Estimating the Impact at the NBAF With consideration of the transmission characteristics previously presented regarding documented NiV and HeV outbreaks, several factors were considered in estimating the impact of a BSL-4 pathogen release from the NBAF. Three major categories of information considered to estimate an outbreak impact included: 1) the expected frequency at which an exposure to a person within the NBAF or a release from the NBAF results in a loss- of-containment; 2) the probability that an infection event (or index case) occurs, given a loss of containment; and 3) the relative impact of an infection event based on the likelihood for subsequent transmission of the disease (to people or host species), given an index case. Sections 9.6 through 9.8 describe the loss- of-containment scenarios considered, based on the activities and experiments expected to be performed in the ABSL-4 AHRs and necropsy room in the NBAF and as identified by ABSL-4 containment experts. The expected frequencies associated with each of these loss- of-containment scenarios, as well as the amount of pathogenic material potentially involved in each loss- of-containment outcome, are presented in Section 9.8. Section 9.9.2.1 describes the specific sub-factors and assumptions associated with estimating the probability of an infection event, given a loss- of-containment. Section 9.9.2.2 presents the impact evaluation, and Section 9.9.2.3 discusses special considerations for emerging or unknown pathogens. 9.9.2.1 Probability of an Index Case Pi is the conditional probability that a given loss- of-containment outcome results in at least one infection (i.e., an index case of either a human or susceptible animal host). The details associated with estimating Pi vary by pathway and are described in more detail later in this section. Regardless of the pathway, the same general methodology applies and involves estimating the probability of infection ( Pi) (of a human or susceptible animal host) given a loss of containment (either an exposure within the NBAF or a release from the NBAF), several factors were considered. First, for each potential loss of containment outcome, the amount of pathogen potentially involved (referred to as the source term or Q value, and presented in Section 9.7) was used to compute the probability that an infectious dose was present. This component of the probability of infection ( Pi) is referred to as Pi-1Q). o In regards to estimating whether or not an infectious dose could be delivered to an animal or human host given the source term, two additional sub-considerations were applied; namely the pathway by which the Q is released (aerosol release from the HEPA filtered stacks, solid waste release, liquid waste release or transference event by which an individual or fomite is directly or indirectly exposed) and how the infectious dose is administered to the host (via inhalation, ingestion or injection); all of these sub-components were considered in determination of P i-1Q. Second, as not only does an infectious dose have to be available in the loss- of-containment, a susceptible species must be proximal to the pathogen in order to inhale, ingest, or inject it as 736 Table 9.9.2 -1: Infectious Dose Thresholds for (TCID 50)a (PFU)b Average Hamster (g) Average LD 50 (PFU/kg) Large Mammal Mass (kg) Infectious Dose (PFU) Intraperitoneally (Ingestion, Injection) 6 12 8.1 110 73.6 86.6 6.36 \u00d7 103 6.30 5.46 \u00d7 102 a Rockx et al., 2011. b Guillaume et al., 2009 Updated SSRA indicated by the pathway of release and individual circumstances associated with the loss. This proximity component of the probability of infection ( Pi) is referred to as Pi-2proximal . Each of these components is discussed in more detail below. Probability of Infection ( Pi-1Q) Probability of infection ( Pi) is the conditional probability that a given loss- of-containment outcome results in at least one infection (i.e., an index case). The approaches for estimating Pi vary by pathway and are described in more detail in subsequent sections. The first component evaluated was the probability that an infectious dose was present in the accident Q term ( P i-1). There are no specific data available regarding the infectious dose of NiV and HeV for human and large animal species, however there has been documented research performed in small mammals to determine the lethal doses and this data (Table 9.9.2-1) was leveraged to estimate the infectious dose for NiV and HeV in large mammals (humans, equine, porcine) [Rockx et al., 2011; Guillaume et al., 2009]. The lethal dose data available from Rockx and Guillaume was used to estimate the total Q term needed to be released from the NBAF (via aerosol, liquid, or solid) or to be transferred to an individual at the NBAF (via inhalation or injection) to result in an infectious dose. In Syrian hamsters, Rockx et al. calculated the lethal dose at which 50% of the animals succumbed to infection (LD 50) to be 6 TCID 50 (~4.2 PFU) less than 1 TCID (~0.7 PFU) intranasally for both NiV and HeV [Rockx et al., 2011]. Guillaume et al. calculated the LD 50 for Syrian hamsters to HeV to be 12 PFU via intraperitoneal inoculation [Guillaume et al., 2009]. Using the average of these two studies, the LD 50 of 8.1 PFU via the intraperitoneal route was normalized to the average mass of a Syrian hamster (110 g) to yield an LD 50 of 73.6 PFU/kg. As infectious dose data of NiV and HeV are not available, these LD 50 values were used as the infectious dose thresholds. For the purpose of this risk assessment, the mass of an average human male (86.6 kg) was used to calculate a single infectious dose threshold of 6.38 \u00d7 103 PFU for animals and humans. Similarly, the infectious dose via intranasal exposure was calculated to be 6.36 PFU/kg and the infectious dose threshold for animals and humans was calculated to be 5.51 \u00d7 10 2 PFU. These values are summarized in Table 9.9.2- 1. \u00ad 737 Updated SSRA For the aerosol pathway through the HEPA filters, virus particles will most likely undergo degradation and will be diluted in the air released from the NBAF stacks (at 85 ft) before it reaches a potential animal or human host. To account for this, a 10-3 degradation and dilution factor of the Q term due to viral desiccation, UV degradation, and/or dilution in the atmosphere post-release from the NBAF was assumed. (Note that this degradation and dilution factor is an assumption; no published data on the stability of NiV or HeV in the atmosphere are currently available.) For the inhalation or respiratory exposures, the intranasal inoculation ID 50 values were used. This resulted in an estimated Q of greater than or equal to 5.46 \u00d7 105 PFU needed before at least 5.46 \u00d7 102 PFU was expected to survive in the atmosphere until it could be inhaled by a susceptible species located nearest the NBAF. For reference, the aerosol fate and transport modeling performed for FMDv in the BSL-3 Ag assessment indicated that no infectious doses (even at the low threshold) reached any farm location near the NBAF until the release Q value from the NBAF location was at least 1.00 \u00d7 105 PFU. Estimation of infectious doses along the solid and liquid waste pathways (i.e., ingestion infectious dose values) was calculated using the intraperitoneal inoculation infectious dose values as no specific ingestion LD 50 values were reported in the literature. As the infectious material in the solid and liquid are diluted and degraded along their system pathways, an animal must either ingest a large amount of waste or there must be a high concentration of infectious material at the release from the NBAF (i.e., high Q value). Susceptible species potentially coming into contact with the potential liquid pathway releases (e.g., due to a failure of the wastewater treatment pond on the NBAF campus or a leak in a pipe along the sewage line) are assumed to ingest 1 gallon of water. Based on the typical daily throughput of waste at the NBAF for the BSL-4 specific effluent decontamination system of 37,099 gallons [NDP, October 2011], the threshold Q value from the NBAF was determined to be 2.36 \u00d7 10 8 PFU/day (results in a concentration of 6.36 \u00d7 103 PFU/gallon in the liquid waste). (No additional loss due to degradation in the wastewater stream was assumed.) The susceptible species coming into contact with NBAF solid waste either along the road to the landfill where it is ultimately dumped or at the landfill itself are assumed to ingest 1 lb of material (see Section 5.0 for maps of the liquid effluent and solid waste routes from the NBAF to the municipal wastewater treatment facility and land fill respectively). For the solid waste pathway, the NBAF is expected to generate 21,000 lbs of ash from the incineration process per year [NDP, June 2010] with a total expected weekly solid waste ash delivery from the NBAF to the landfill of 404 lbs (based on 52 work weeks/year). On a per day basis, approximately 57.7 lbs of ash are produced. Given these assumptions, the resulting Q value needed to potentially result in an infectious dose through ingestion of the solid waste was calculated to be 3.67 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/day (results in a concentration of 6.36 \u00d7 103 PFU/lb in the solid waste). (No additional loss due to degradation in the solid waste pathway was assumed.) Table 9.9.2-2 summarizes the threshold Q values for determining whether the viral material released via these pathways is greater than the infectious dose. 738 Table 9.9.2 -2: Threshold Q Values for Infectious Dose to Large Mammala Waste Dilution/ Produced Infectious Degradation Amount Exposure Route Dose (PFU) Factor Per Day Consumed Threshold n/a 37,099 gallons 1 103 \u00d7 103 a large mammal mass of 86.6 kg, adult human male Updated SSRA The Q v alue thresholds shown in Table 9.9.2-2 were used as the baseline for assigning the probability that the low, medium or high source term ( Q) of each event was greater than or equal to the infectious dose threshold per route of exposure. These corresponding Pi-1Q probabilities represent 99.9% confidence (6 ) that either the low, medium or high Q source term is greater than or equal to the estimated corresponding threshold. This conservative approach in probability assignment accounts for uncertainty in the source term estimation (i.e., the 95 th percentile Q term which in some instances was several orders of magnitude greater that the 5th percentile Q term was always considered a possibility for release and as such the correspondi ng Pi-1Q values may be overestimated relative to if the 50th percentile Q term was chosen; however to represent the worse-case the 95th percentile Q terms were included. The probability of exceeding the threshold was computed by first computing the z-score associated with the threshold (i.e., the threshold minus the expected value for Q divided by the estimated standard deviation for Q) and then computing the probability of observing a z-score as high as or higher than that obtained, assuming a standard normal distribution. Specifically, the z-score and Pi-1Q were computed as follows: Equation 9.9.2-1 9.9.2 -3: Probability that Susceptible are Proximal to the Release (P i-2 proximal ) Pathway Transference Report/Contact No Report/Contact Pathogen Index Species Aerosol Solid or Liquid Precaution Precaution Human 0.9 0.001 0.001 0.900 NiV Equation 9.9.2-2 These resulting Pi-1Q probabilities represent the probability that the observed source term in a given loss of containment occurrence ( Q) will be greater than or equal to the estimated threshold required to result in a potential infection. For each loss- of-containment scenario, the calculated Pi-1Q values can be viewed in Table 9.9.2-4 (of the following section). Probability that Release Occurs in Proximity to Susceptible Species ( Pi-2 proximal ) For each loss- of-containment occurrence, the proximity of a susceptible species to the release point was factored into the probability of subsequent infection. If there was not sufficient contact, no infection would occur regardless of the Q source term value. The following paragraphs outline the assumptions associated with determining the probability that susceptible species will be proximal to the release points at the NBAF. The probabilities assigned based on those assumptions are presented in Table 9.9.2-3. For events along the aerosol release pathway, it was assumed that all potential index species could be pro ximal to the release point (either in the laboratory during a breach in suit function or on or around the NBAF grounds should a release occur from the HEPA filtered stacks). For events involving releases along the solid and liquid waste stream; it was assumed that no humans would ingest liquid effluent or solid waste. Therefore the probability that humans will become infected via these routes was assigned a low probability regardless of their proximity to the breach in the system (Pi-2proximal = 0.001). The assignment of a non-zero probability reflects the small possibility that a person could become exposed through inadvertent exposure, via ingestion or secondary aerosolization, to these materials. The same probability was assigned to both NiV and HeV. 740 Updated SSRA For events along the solid or liquid waste streams, special consideration was given to the proximity of susceptible animal species. Given the location of the Manhattan, Kansas, sewage treatment line and the road leading to the landfill from the NBAF (see Section 5.0 for the detailed figures of these paths) it is possible (albeit somewhat unlikely) that domestic livestock will leave a farm (through a barrier fence) and travel to the site of the breach of the solid or liquid pathway (the nearest farm is 300m from the NBAF). It is also possible that susceptible wildlife (e.g., feral pigs) may contact these locations as they are not contained within farms. However, given the vast number of farms that contains livestock susceptible to NiV, as evident, for example, by the number of pig farms in Kansas (see Figure 9.9.2-1), coupled with the prevalence of feral pigs in the Midwest, it was considered likely that susceptible animals are sufficiently proximal to any NiV releases along the, solid or liquid pathways such that an exposure could occur. Given this proximity, it was also assumed that if pathogen was released from the NBAF HEPA filtered stacks (aerosol release pathway), that it was likely to come into contact with susceptible specie s on nearby farms. Note that for these events P i-2proximal was set to 0.9. Figure 9.9.2-1: Swine Farms within a 200km Radius of the NBAF Manhattan, Kansas. With more than 103,000 horses participating in over 28,000 equine events and activities on more than 944,000 acres, these animals play a significant role in the agricultural and tourism industry of the state of Kansas (KSU online). K-State located in Manhattan, Kansas, houses the Kansas State University Equine Program, for undergraduate and graduate students. This program 741 Updated SSRA combines hands on experience, research, community involvement, and equine-focused clubs and teams. Manhattan is also home to the Kansas Horse Council, which connects horse lovers and owners from all over the state. Given that the K-State campus is adjacent to the NBAF, it was also considered that susceptible species (primarily horses) are sufficiently proximal to any potential aerosol, solid or liquid pathways from the NBAF. Based on these considerations, the probability that the release will occur in proximity to a susceptible animal species ( P i-2proximal ) was assigned as to a value of 0.90 for all animal- related solid, liquid, and aerosol loss- of-containment occurrences for HeV. For events involving transference of pathogen via fomite contacts, the same probabilities for transference of a laboratory human exposure when reporting or subsequent medical response failed were assumed. It was assumed that if a worker was aware that pathogen still remained on a fomite, they would not remove it from the laboratory. If they were unaware that viable pathogen still remained on the fomite (assumed for all these events) then the fomite would move unrestricted out of containment with the same probability of an individual who was not under medical monitoring or exercising contact precautions (see Table 9.9.1-5, Transference No Report/Contact Precautions values). It was also assumed that only people (as opposed to both people and susceptible livestock) would be handling these fomites (e.g., a package to be shipped to another laboratory), and therefore probabilities regarding proximity to these materials were set to zero for animals. Given the differences in person- to-person transmission potential for NiV and HeV; the following assumptions were also applied. For NiV human infections not reported (where contact precautions were not exercised, person- to-person transmission was considered likely (P i-2proximal = 0.900). For HeV, the occurrence of person- to-person transmission is reportedly negligible and therefore this was assigned a Pi-2proximal value of 0.001 regardless of whether there was appropriate medical response (i.e., contact precautions or protective PPE and practices suitable to prevent subsequent transmission). Overall Probability of an Index Case ( Pi) The probabilities assigned to Pi-1Q and Pi-2proximal were applied to each of the loss- of-containment occurrences considered in the ABSL- 4 assessment and those values presented in Table 9.9.2-4. For each pathogen and index species (human or animal), Pi was computed as the product of Pi-1Q and Pi-2proximal . Table 9.9.2-4 also presents the resulting index case frequencies ( Fevent) which are the product of the Pi and the frequency of the loss- of-containment event ( Floss). 742 Updated SSRA 743 Table 9.9.2 -4: Probability of Infection and Frequency of Infection by Event -Pi 2Prox Index Case Frequency ( FEvent ) Q Values NiV HeV NiV HeV Originating Frequency -Event ID Location Pathway Description Low Medium High (FLoss) (yr 1) -Pi 1Q Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal Aerosol Sedation works or squeeze chute works or no dropped No Inf.

Note that emerging pathogens were considered for completeness. However the outbreak impact of an emerging pathogen is unknown and therefore was qualitatively discussed at the end of this section. To account for the differences in value between a human life and the life of livestock, the average number of human lives lost or animals culled reported in the historical case reviews (Section 9.9.1.1) were multiplied by the estimated value of a human life and the estimated value of livestock at auction. The estimated value of an adult human life ($9.1 million) was determined by the EPA in 2010 during the performance of a regulatory impact analysis [EPA 452/R- 10-002 February 2010].For NiV outbreaks this resulted in an average relative impact of $373,100,000 (41 \u00d7 $9,100,000 = $373,100,000) per outbreak. For HeV this resulted in an overall relative impact of $2,093,000 (0.23 \u00d7 $9,100,000 = $2,093,000) per average outbreak. Similarly, the average number of livestock infections and cullings reported for NiV and HeV outbreaks were multiplied by the current list price per lb of these commodities (USDA / Ag. Marketing Service \u00ad report LS-HG200 for swine reported $67.59/cwt at 240 lbs each ($162.22) and the Centennial Livestock Auction, Granby, CO 26 October 2011, cited up to $21.50/cwt at 1400 lbs ($301) for non high- performance horses. When averaged across all NiV outbreaks reported, this resulted in an average relative livestock impact of $11,587,212 (71,429 \u00d7 $162.22 = $11,587,212) and for HeV this resulted in an average livestock relative impact of $641.13 (2.13 \u00d7 $301 = 641.13). Note that these are estimated impacts intended to provide a relative difference between the impact of a NiV outbreak and a HeV outbreak (as they are reportedly different) and is no way intended to indicate the absolute impact of either such an event should a release occur from the NBAF. From these values, a relative impact score was calculated to convey relative impact across pathogen type, size of outbreak (single infection vs. multiple), and whether it impacted humans, animals or both. This was estimated by normalizing the impact values to that of a single HeV infected animal ($301), i.e., all impact values were divided by $301 to provide a relative scoring. The resulting scores are presented in Table 9.9.2-5, the inputs to which were described in the preceding paragraphs. 755 Table 9.9.2 -5: Relative Impact Score Calculations a Single or Relative Impact Score Average Description Outbreak Species NiV HeV Assumptions 30,233 30,233 Human Based on assumed ($9.1M / $301) ($9.1M / $301) Events unlikely to Single relative impact of a result i n Human or 0.54 1 single human or single transmission Animal Animal animal infection per beyond index case ($162 / $301) Events likely to ($373.1M / $301) ($2.09M / $301) reported impact result in Average across documented subsequent 38,496 2.13 Outbreak NiV or HeV outbreaks Animal transmission not specific to the ($11.6M / $301) ($641 / $303) beyond index case NBAF Total 1,278,031 6,956 a Assumes one infected horse at $301; all values were normalized by dividing by $301 to achieve relative impact scores. Updated SSRA The assumptions applied across the events in assigning these impact ratios are detailed in the following bull ets: In general it was assumed that if the person was aware of the infection/exposure (as indicated by reporting it and receiving proper medical response), they would maintain proper contact precaution rules such that 1) workers would not to come into contact with susceptible species for at least 3 days and that no transference to subsequent species would be observed (i.e., the probability unlikely) and 2) proper medical response including medical monitoring, limited contacts (contact precautions)proper PPE and contact precautions would be adhered to such that subsequent person to person transmission were unlikely (i.e., the relative impact score shown in the Events unlikely to result in subsequent transmission row of Table 9.9.2-5 applies). If the worker/animal was unaware of an exposure, or failed to report the incident or failed to receive proper medical response, the worker was considered less reliable in regards to following the contact precaution/quarantine rule and subsequent transmission potential considered likely (i.e., the relative impact score shown in the Events likely to result in subsequent transmission row of Table 9.9.2-5 applies). 756 Updated SSRA For events where there was a potential for initial animal infection (i.e., release along the solid, liquid or aerosol pathways); it was assumed likely that there would be subsequent animal-animal transference, given the large number of farms/stables and density of susceptible species (pigs, horses) in Manhattan, Kansas (i.e., the relative impact score shown in the Events likely to result in subsequent transmission row of Table 9.9.2-5 applies). The described relative impact scores were applied to each event according to the assumptions detailed above by pathogen type (NiV and HeV) and host species (human and animal). These relative impact scores represent the relative consequence value (C) and were used in the calculation of risk described in Section 9.10 and presented within Table 9.10.1-1. 9.9.2.3 Special Consideration for Emerging Pathogens As the NBAF will be the most current ABSL-4 containment facility of its type in the U.S., the NBAF will have a very significant role in evaluating and responding to emerging zoonotic disease threats in animals. Therefore it is important to at least begin the discussion of the potential impact of working with new or emerging pathogens to inform future operations. For emerging or unknown pathogens, previously recognized symptoms of illness may go unnoticed or misdiagnosed leading to prolonged time to quarantine, and unprotected exposures, both of which would likely increase the overall impact of an outbreak. Delayed recognition of HeV as the cause among sick horses (because they experienced neurologic symptoms rather than the normal and expected respiratory equine symptoms) was cited as one of the contributors to the human illnesses observed during the 2008 HeV outbreak [Playford, 2010]. Furthermore, emerging or genetically modified pathogens may exhibit a more efficient person- to\u00ad person transmission, a more efficient animal- to-person transmission, a greater resistance to antiviral therapy, resistance to countermeasures such as vaccination, or evade current diagnostic assays for proper and expedient diagnoses. Thus until such a time as these properties are better defined for the emerging/modified pathogens, one should conservatively assume a significant impact given any release of such a modified or emerging threat. Even if an exposure is known and reported due to the fact that an emerging pathogen may possess unexpected characteristics (increased virulence, increased stability, increased transmission efficiency, increased potential to cross species barriers and be isolated from unexpected hosts ,etc., ) to err on the side of caution is prudent. The probability of pathogen sustainment within the environment due to the presence of reservoir hosts (domestic or uncontrolled wildlife) is a concern for emerging pathogens and was considered in the NiV and HeV assessment. The only small or flying wildlife known to be hosts (reservoirs) to NiV or HeV are fruit bats - seroconversion and isolation of HeV and NiV-like viruses from fruit bats of the Pteropus genus have established this bat as the natural reservoir for both viruses [Bossart et al., 2007]. This genus of bat is geographically found in all locations where HeV and NiV outbreaks have occurred [Bossart et al., 2007]. Flying foxes have been found from Madagascar, India, Southeast Asia (including Malaysia and Singapore), Bangladesh, the East Indies, the Philippines, and Australia to the Samoan and Cook Islands [Constantine, 2003; Lehle, 2007]. A U.S. Geological Survey lists three species of flying foxes to have been 2003], but no literature was found to 757 Updated SSRA suggest that flying foxes are found anywhere in the U.S., including Manhattan, Kansas. As such, the relative impact ratio scores used in this ABSL-4 assessment may overestimate the impact at the NBAF as the contribution of reservoir hosts to sustain the pathogen in the environment contributing to spillover events is represented in the average historical outbreaks used to develop the impact ratio at the NBAF. It is possible however, that Henipavirus will cross the species barrier to infect new hosts, such as bats or other mammals that do inhabit Kansas or the surrounding states. In such a case, the impact ratios applied in this assessment address this potentiality, as well as the potentiality that for emerging agents, reservoir host species may inhabit the Manhattan, Kansas area. 9.10 Risk Ranking, Conclusions and Recommendations: In accordance with the DHS Risk Lexicon [September 2010] risk is determined by two key components: the probability of an unwanted incident, event, or occurrence, and the consequence of such an event. In this assessment, the consequence (C) is represented by a relative impact score, given that a loss- of\u00ad containment outcome is realized and an infection event ensues. The following describes the basic approach to performing the ABSL-4 risk calculations. The approach for the ABSL-4 assessment follows closely that which was performed for the FMDv assessment, with the exception that uncertainties were not quantitatively estimated in the ABSL-4 evaluation, and the consequence values were based on relative impacts and cannot be interpreted as expected absolute economic (or other metric) impact. Following the risk calculations, the risk associated with each event was ranked and associated conclusions and recommendations presented herein. 9.10.1 Risk Calculations and Risk Ranking There are three parameters presented in Section 9.8 associated with each outcome in each fault tree that are relevant to the risk calculations: F loss is the expected frequency of a given loss- of-containment outcome (i.e., event probability)3. The probability of each loss- of-containment outcome is computed based on the probabilities associated with each step in the sequence that leads to that outcome. This probability is multiplied by the number of opportunities per year, to obtain Floss. Q represents the amount of NiV or HeV involved in each loss- of-containment outcome. Low, medium, and high Q terms are computed for each loss- of-containment outcome, and typically represent the 5th percentile, the mean, and the 95th percentiles of virus involved in the loss or release. These are referred to as QL, QM, and QH. In addition to the parameters above, two additional parameters associated with each outcome for each fault tree that are key to risk calculations include the following: P i is the conditional probability that a given loss- of-containment outcome results in an infection (i.e., an index case). The approaches for estimating Pi varied by pathway, pathogen type and host 3 outcomes are included. 758 Updated SSRA species (human or animal) as described previously in Section 9.9. For each event, a separate estimate for P i was computed to indicate the probability that: 1) the Q source term was greater than or equal to the established infectious dose threshold; and 2) the probability that the release event occurred proximal to susceptible species. The resulting conditional probabilities are listed as: P i-1Q, and Pi-2Proximal respectively. Pi is the product of these two terms for a given pathogen and host species. C is the relative consequence by pathogen (NiV and HeV), given that the loss- of-containment outcome is realized and an infection (of either human or animal) ensues. For this assessment, C is taken to be equal to the relative impact score presented in Section 9.9.2.2. Note that if the conditional probability of an infection for a given loss- of-containment event was zero, the corresponding consequence was not modeled and the corresponding C terms were set equal to These parameters were used to compute the risk for each event and pathogen as the sum of the expected impact for an animal host plus the expected impact for a human host, minus the expected impact of a simultaneous human and animal infection. The equation applied is shown below: Equation 9.10.1-1 The result of these risk calculations performed for all of the ABSL-4 events assessed as well as a description of each event are presented in Table 9.10.1-1. This table includes the calculated frequency of a loss- of-containment event ( Floss) per year, the index case frequency ( Fevent) by pathogen type and host species, the impact score ( C) by pathogen type and host species, and risk by pathogen. Events in which the Q H within the Index Case Frequency column; and no further calculations performed. All of these events ! even those event frequencies occurring less than one time per one billion years (and beyond) are presented for completeness. However, practically, these events are not considered credible and therefore were not prioritized for additional mitigation recommendations. The data in Table 9.10.1-1 are presented according to originating location and pathway, in order of events assessed; no data sorting (e.g., highest to lowest risk) was performed. 759 Updated SSRA 760 Updated SSRA 7 61 Table 9.10.1 -1: Frequency of Infection, Impact, and Risk by Event Index Case Frequency ( FEvent ) Impact Ratio ( C) NiV HeV NiV HeV Risk Originating Frequency -Event ID Location Pathway Description (FLoss) (yr 1) Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal NiV HeV Aerosol Sedation works or squeeze chute works or no dropped inoculum or container No Inf.

At this stage in the NBAF development, and with the maturity of available data for NiV and HeV, a risk ranking is appropriate and offers a means by which to identify areas of focus for DHS in regards to additional operational, design, or mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the event analyses alone, which estimated the frequency of accidental releases for each event ( F loss), provide valuable information. Understanding the failures that can lead to a release are as critical, if not more so than estimating the impact, in regards to the identification of relevant strategies to prevent their occurrence. The impact analyses, although based on historical data, comes with a level of uncertainty given the outbreaks reported have occurred in nations with grossly different farming and medical practices than what exists at and around the NBAF. However, the impact analyses performed do provide a means of ranking the estimated risk of the ABSL-4 events such that DHS can begin prioritizing efforts on the events that exhibit the most significant risk and/or occur with the greatest frequency. As more data for NiV, HeV, and/or emerging pathogens become available, the event and impact analyses performed herein can easily be adapted to accommodate updated source terms, probabilities of infection, and impact estimates. The following section presents the conclusions and recommendations resulting from the further analysis of the data presented in Table 9.10.1- 1. 9.10.2 Conclusions and Recommendations The conclusions regarding risk from release of pathogen from the ABSL-4 along the aerosol, solid, liquid and transference pathways are presented in the following text and corresponding tables and figures. Regarding the aerosol pathway, no infection events resulted from any of the aerosol events generated through the loss of NiV or HeV material during animal inoculation activities (represented by events L4AAi0-L4AAi9 of Table 9.10.2- 1). Furthermore, no infection events resulted from any of the aerosol release events generated from ABSL-4 AHR or necropsy due to pathogen contributions from the animals themselves (within AHRs), or through aerosolization of pathogen during necropsy activities when the HEPA filtration system was functioning nominally, or when it was degraded under any of the potential permutations of degradation (events L4AA1-L4AA9 for AHR and L4AN1-L4AN9 for necropsy, as shown in Table 9.10.2-2). Only two aerosol events out of the 30 evaluated resulted in any risk, namely L4AA10 and L4AN10, which represent a total failure of the HEPA filtration caisson in ABSL-4 AHR and ABSL-4 necropsy respectively. For completeness, total HEPA failure had to be evaluated in the event analysis. However, the frequency of total HEPA failure given the redundancy of the HEPA caisson system in place at the NBAF, make these two extremely unlikely events (loss- of-containment frequencies of 6 \u00d7 10 -32 yr-1 and 5 \u00d7 10-33 yr-1) with corresponding risk values approaching zero (ranging from 1.5 \u00d7 10-29 to 3.4 \u00d7 10-27). As such, these in any credible risk ranking is noteworthy in that it is reflective of the sentiments of the containment community expressed during the 14 September 2011 NAS meeting and again during the 08 November 2011 ABSL-4 Assessment SME solicitation meeting. While participants suggested that containment facilities have great confidence in HEPA filtration, and although it was agreed that for completeness, that all pathways of release must be considered, the panel did not expect aerosol release events via the 771 Updated SSRA HEPA filtration system to represent a significant risk regarding ABSL-4 activities. The risk mitigation of redundant in-series and in-parallel HEPA filtration caissons planned within the NBAF 65% Design appears to provide significant protection against release along this pathway from ABSL-4 AHR and necropsy rooms. 772 Updated SSRA 773 Table 9.10.2 -1: Frequency of Infection, Impact, and Risk by Aerosol (Dropped Inoculum) Pathway (Sorted by NiV Risk, Low to High) Index Case Frequency ( FEvent ) Impac t Ratio ( C) NiV HeV NiV HeV Risk Originating Frequency -Event ID Location Pathway Description (FLoss) (yr 1) Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal NiV HeV Aerosol Sedation works or squeeze chute works or no dropped inoculum or container No Inf.

None of the 18 liquid waste events evaluated resulted in an observable risk, suggesting that the NBAF planned in- facility effluent decontamination systems offer risk mitigation in regards to working with large animals in BSL-4 containment. The majority of the solid waste pathway events (11 out of 16) regardless of originating location (ABSL- 4 AHR or necropsy) resulted in no infection events (see Table 9.10.2-4). The five solid waste events that resulted in a risk value only occurred when the on-site incinerator failed in all cases where the incinerator was functional, regardless of functioning redundant autoclaves or tissue autoclave, the incineration alone was sufficient to reduce the quantity of infectious material to levels below the infectious dose threshold eliminating any resulting infections. When the incinerator failed and the in- series autoclaves were functional (event L4AS2), the in-series autoclaves were sufficient at reducing the risk from red-bagged autoclaved waste. (It should be noted that this event is not applicable to carcass disposal). As long as either the incinerator (for carcass rendering solid waste disposal or red bag waste disposal) OR the in- series autoclaves are functional (applicable to red bag waste disposal only), the solid waste pathway does not appear to pose observable risk. Of the solid waste pathway events that had observable risk, the greatest risk was observed when the tissue autoclave from ABSL-4 necropsy was functioning, yet the incinerator failed. This risk is reflective of the large viral load and sheer mass of material considered in the disposal of infected carcasses (as compared to standard red-bag solid waste). It is also notable that the frequency of release or F Loss for the 5 solid waste events with observable risk ranged from 2.0 \u00d7 10-9 yr-1 to 2.0 \u00d7 10-19 yr-1 or less than once every 500 million years. 777 Updated SSRA 778 Updated SSRA 779 Table 9.10.2 -3: Frequency of Infection, Impact, and Risk by Liquid W aste Pathway (Sorted by NiV Risk, Low to High) Index Case Frequency ( FEvent ) Impact Ratio ( C) NiV HeV NiV HeV Risk Originating Frequency -Event ID Location Pathway Description (FLoss) (yr 1) Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal NiV HeV Source decontamination of drain pipes works, cook tank works, wastewater No Inf.

The transference-injection pathway contained the highest ranked risk events for NiV and HeV observed across all 109 events evaluated (see Table 9.10.2-5, events L4NTI1, L4NTI3 and L4NTI2). The events demonstrating the highest risk values originated within the ABSL-4 necropsy room in which a researcher cut their PPE during a standard necropsy procedure resulting in a breach of the skin barrier with a (NiV or HeV) contaminated scalpel and did not receive the appropriate medical response (i.e., medical monitoring, reducing contact, or adhering to barrier practices to prevent subsequent transmission to other people). [Note that in these events the researcher did not either report the event or receive the proper medical response both of which are in violation of standard protocols.] Three other transference-injection events also resulted in observable risk events L4ATli1, L4ATli3 and L4ATli2. These events originated in the AHR during inoculation of study animals and resulted in lower observed risk values compared to the transference-injection events originating from the necropsy room. This observation is consistent with containment community SME feedback that indicated sharps handling errors during necropsy procedures were of concern. For both pathogens, the transference-respiratory suit failures that lead to respiratory exposure of the researchers working within the AHR were among the highest risk events as evident by the risk value assigned to events L4ATRs3, L4ATRs5, L4ATRs4, L4ATRs6 and L4ATRs9 (Table 9.10.2-6). The observed risk in these events was attributed to degradation of the encapsulated suit respiratory protection (due to a tear/leak) coupled with exposure to potentially significant amounts of aerosolized pathogen being generated by the infected animals within the AHR. [Note that the observed risk for similar sequence of events in the necropsy room was significantly less.] In all of the transference-respiratory events evaluated (originating from the AHR or necropsy) where PPE function was nominal, no infection events were observed (thus no risk). These observations indicate that practice of and conformance to procedures to maintain, frequently evaluate, and verify respiratory PPE performance as well as minimize movements in AHRs to prevent suit tears may reduce the risk of respiratory exposures. 781 Updated SSRA 782 Updated SSRA 7 83 Table 9.10.2 -5 Frequency of Infection, Impact, and Risk by Transference Injection Pathway (Sorted by NiV Risk, Low to High) Index Case Frequency ( FEvent ) Impact Ratio ( C) NiV HeV NiV HeV Risk Originating Frequency -Event ID Location Pathway Description (FLoss) (yr 1) Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal NiV HeV Transference Researcher cuts through PPE and through the skin barrier.

Two transference-contact circumstances were considered along this pathway. The first contact pathway involves the transfer of infectious material to E was assumed in these contact events that the infectious material could result in an infection through membranes if the material was not sufficiently removed via spot disinfection.) The second contact pathway involves the transfer of infectious material to a fomite (i.e., the outside of a sample container that is taken out of containment). Regarding these two types of transference-contact events, the only events that resulted in observable risk were those where the researcher either: 1) failed to recognize the exposure and thereby did not treat the contamination through proper disinfection at the site of the exposure (hand) such as in events L4NTCp3, L4NTCp4, and L4NTCp5; or 2) completely failed to process the sample container through the required decontamination steps for shipment of a sample out of the facility including a chemical shower, followed by the equivalent of three dunk tank disinfections (event L4NTCf8). The frequency associated with the failure to decontaminate the fomite (sample container) was extremely low (1.85 \u00d7 10 -10), or once every 5.4 billion years, indicating this is not likely a credible subsequent spot treatment with a chemical disinfectant was applied, as demonstrated by event number L4NTCp3, was significant, especially when working with NiV (risk value of 6.05 \u00d7 104 for NiV and 3.77 \u00d7 10-1 for HeV). These events indicate that immediate decontamination of potentially exposed skin using SOPs may effectively mitigate the risks of these exposures and that adequate and continued training of this practice should be enforced at the NBAF. 787 Updated SSRA 788 Updated SSRA 789 Table 9.10.2 -7: Frequency of Infection, Impact, and Risk by Transfer ence Contact Pathway (Sorted by NiV Risk, High to Low) Index Case Frequency ( FEvent ) Impact Ratio ( C) NiV HeV NiV HeV Risk Originating Frequency Event ID - Location Pathway Description (FLoss) (yr 1) Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal Human Animal NiV HeV Researcher cuts through their PPE suit and there is a contact transference event.

For both pathogens the lowest risk values were observed with events along the solid waste release pathway. No observable, credible risk was observed along the aerosol or liquid waste pathways. Figure 9.10.2-1: NiV Event Risk Summary by Release Pathway Figures 9.10.2-1 and 9.10.2-2 represent the risk of each of the 107 events by pathway with associated event frequency and spread of the event frequency across the events (as shown by box plot range and whiskers). [Note that the two extremely low aerosol event frequencies (i.e., full HEPA failure) previously deemed as not credible, were eliminated from the range calculations in the box plots.] These composite figures visually represent all events and, at-a-glance, offer insight into which release pathways dominate the risk (for detail regarding specific data points, the corresponding tables are referenced). The colors of 791 Updated SSRA the circles represent the risk associated with each event and the size of the circle is based on the value of the calculated risk per event (i.e., a larger circle represents an event with greater risk). The small black points represent events that had no observable risk. In general, the trend of observable risk was consistent across the two pathogens evaluated; the data indicate that the greatest risk for both NiV and HeV activities in ABSL-4 is along transference pathway releases, followed by a few observable, although highly infrequent, events along the solid waste pathway, and no observable, credible risk along the liquid or aerosol pathways. NiV, with the increased potential for person- to-person transmission as compared to HeV, resulted in a greater overall impact (and thus greater risk), as shown in the risk shading differences presented in Figures 9.10.2-1 and 9.10.2\u00ad 2. Furthermore, the impact ratio associated with human infection was significantly greater than that for animal infection due to the variant value of human life versus livestock, as described in Section 9.9.2.2. While the risk values were variable between the two pathogens, the general trends were sufficiently consistent such that risk mitigation measures (e.g., administrative controls based on procedures and staff training; and physical controls, which are derived from facility design parameters and installation of specified safety equipment) should reduce the frequency of fault events that led to the potential releases regardless of pathogen type. 792 Updated SSRA Figure 9.10.2-2: HeV ABSL-4 Event Risk Summary by Release Pathway By far, the greatest risk is observed along the transference pathway, which relies less on design elements for success as it does on a trained, compliant staff, and well defined standard operating practices, plans and procedures. This observation is consistent with feedback from the biocontainment community, which suggested that human errors during necropsy and handling of infected animals posed the greatest threats to workers inside ABSL-4 containment. Through this ABSL-4 assessment, with the exception of five infrequent solid waste events, it appears that the 65% Design elements mitigate the risk of NiV or HeV release along the aerosol, solid, and liquid pathways from ABSL-4 containment. 793 Updated SSRA Table 9.10.2-8 presents all 30 of the evaluated ABSL-4 events that resulted in an observable risk (the two HEPA failure events were removed as they were deemed not credible to the extremely low event frequency). The events were sorted by event frequency, with the resulting return period for each event presented. The corresponding risk values for NiV and HeV are presented on the far right columns and were ranked (see numbers 1-30 in red text, 1 indicating the highest risk ranking; see previous tables in Section 9.10 for events ranked by risk). Recommendations were formed to address all of the 30 events that resulted in any risk value, even those with negligible risk. The vast majority of the risk observed in the ABSL-4 assessment could be attributed to human error. This observation highlights the importance for the NBAF (as it nears operation over the next eight years) to develop SOPs, plans, and practices with continued periodic training of staff to assess their continued compliance. The observable risk also indicates that proper training of staff (e.g., biosafety, biosecurity, biocontainment, security, etc.) through continuing education and refresher training to ensure the understanding and compliance with SOPs, plans, and practices will reduce the potential for the human errors attributed to the transference events and the subsequent impact of an initial laboratory acquired infection. Biocontainment SMEs suggested that the key to a properly functioning facility is the operating staff, emphasizing that personnel represent the first line in protecting the facility and maintaining containment. The observable risk also indicates that proper training of staff against well-developed SOPs, which is reinforced through regular and continuing education/refresher training, and ensuring the understanding and compliance with those procedures/practices through monitoring (e.g., video, buddy system, audits, etc.,) will reduce the potential for the human errors attributed to the transference events and the subsequent impact of an initial laboratory acquired infection (through education of proper exposure reporting and response procedures). The specific types of SOPs and training recommended, relevant to the specific events assessed in this body of work, include: Provide continuing education on necropsy skills and techniques that minimize sharps hazards; Perform and re-enforce training on minimization of movement practices and maintaining safe working distances from animals within the ABSL-4 AHRs to prevent suit tears; Perform and reinforce training on the importance of suit checks. Perform evaluation of suit performance and methods of suit maintenance in collaboration with international containment partners to identify and leverage the current state- of-the-practice in regards to their use and care; Develop, implement, and monitor conformance to SOPs that emphasize scrutiny of suit upon containment entry and exit to ensure any breaches are recognized so that appropriate mitigation, decontamination, and/or medical response may be initiated; Develop, monitor, and enforce adherence to training and SOPs on the control of animals in containment, including sedation practices, and squeeze chute and pen operation; Develop, monitor, and enforce adherence to SOPs on the maintenance and regular monitoring of autoclave and incinerator performance; and, 794 Updated SSRA Provide continuing education and training on proper decontamination procedures. Events that resulted in an initial infection that were in turn elevated due to subsequent infection events in this large animal ABSL-4 assessment, may be mitigated through: Periodic training and continuing education of the NBAF staff on proper exposure reporting and medical response procedures; and Working with the medical and veterinary health organizations and facilities within or around the NBAF (such as Mercy Regional Health Center, University of Kansas Hospital, and local veterinarians) to establish capability and capacity to rapidly respond to NiV, HeV, or other zoonotic exposures such that proper detection, diagnosis, treatment, and other medical response procedures (such as contact precautions, etc.) are initiated as soon as possible should an exposure or infection occur (see Section 3, Best Practices, for a more detailed account of the local healthcare capacity near the NBAF). Of the 30 events with observable risk, event-specific SOPs, training, and related recommendations are proposed in Table 9.10.2-8. The general recommendations designed to reduce human error and monitor system performance (described above) are applicable to all of the events with observable risk; however, these recommendations have not been duplicated in Table 9.10.2- 8. 795 Updated SSRA 796 Updated SSRA 797 Table 9.10.2 -8: Events with Associated Risk and Proposed Risk Mitigations (Sorted by Event Frequency) Event Return Risk Originat ing Frequency Period - Nipah HeV Event ID Location Pathway Description (FLoss) (yr 1) (yr/event) Risk Mitigation Recommendation Develop, train, and enforce adherence to SOPs on safe necropsy practices.

Updated SSRA In addition to the recommendations provided above, other sources of guidelines and practices should continue to be reviewed for applicability and relevant practices adapted for inclusion in the operations, preparedness, and/or response plans for the NBAF as it approaches operation over the next eight years. For example, zoonotic viruses necessitate appropriate working procedures and personal protective equipment in veterinary practice [Hanna, 2006]. Findings, such as the infection of veterinary workers during field examinations and autopsies, have led to publication of revised guidelines for veterinarians handling horses suspected of HeV infection. These guidelines, published through the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, provide clinical case definitions, recommended response measures, PPE guidance, and reporting procedures that may be leveraged. Furthermore, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), one of the only containment facilities in the world currently working with large animals within ABSL-4 containment (HeV infected horses), will provide all relevant ABSL- 4 SOPs, incident response plans, biosafety plans, etc., so that relevant practices may be adapted for NBAF operations, maintenance, preparedness, and response planning. Due to the complexity of zoonotic diseases and the associated impact of a release, it is recommended \u0011! ! researchers and human (and zoonotic) disease researchers work in very similar environments, use similar lexicons, and apply many of the same basi are different, and early, integrated, and periodic training will help mitigate risks that may otherwise arise from these differences. It is also suggested that DHS and USDA arrange for temporary assignments that will put future NBAF staff members in different laboratory environments prior to their assignment at the NBAF. These and other guidelines from the containment community should be periodically reviewed and leveraged to develop state- of-the-practice updates. As the NBAF is not slated to become operational until 2020, it is prudent to consider the recommendations presented herein as guidelines that should be adapted, modified, or improved as new relevant information become available regarding containment practices and procedures. 801 Updated SSRA 802 Updated SSRA 10.Conclusions and Recommendations The Updated SSRA provides a current assessment of the risks associated with the operation of the NBAF at the selected Manhattan, Kansas location based on the latest design documents and other information available at the time of evaluation. In addition to incorporating input from DHS, USDA, and other sources, this update addresses findings and recommendations made by the NAS SSRA Committee. This iteration of the risk management process provides an updated quantitative assessment of the risks associated with FMDv research (Section 1-8) and an estimate of risks associated with zoonotic pathogen research on large animal models in BSL-4 laboratories (Section 9). Conclusions from these assessments are presented in Section 10.1; recommendations for DHS and other NBAF stakeholders are presented in Section 10.2. A summary of continuing risk management efforts and DHS responses to NAS SSRA Committee findings on the SSRA is provided in Section 10.3. The Updated SSRA is part of the overall DHS risk management effort for the NBAF and is based on the 65% Design. This update satisfies Congressional requirements (Public Law 112 10, \u00a71647), addresses feedback provided by the NAS SSRA Committee, incorporates additional data collected on the selected site (Manhattan, Kansas), uses the most up-to date modeling tools, and integrates updated design, operations, and accident response strategies into the assessment. DHS has completed the 50% and 65% Designs, thus satisfying the requirements of \u00a71647(b)(1). The Updated SSRA satisfies the Congressional requirements for demonstrating how calculated risks have been significantly reduced by incorporating mitigations into the risk assessment and addressing shortcomings identified by the NAS SSRA Committee (\u00a71647(b)(2), \u00a71647(c)(1)) through the application of the following enhancements, and others, to the risk assessment process: Providing a more systematic approach to the assessment of potential accident events including the use of fault tree and event tree analyses; Characterizing uncertainties in calculated results based on standard deviations, unknowns, assumptions, and stochastic variability associated with inputs that are modeled in the assessment; Incorporating the use of a published tornado return period calculation methodology; Providing additional knowledge and data collected for the NBAF location (e.g., susceptible populations, outbreak control measure resources, etc.) that were used in the predictive epidemiological modeling; and Developing and using a methodology to estimate the cumulative risk of an FMD infection that would result from an accidental release of viable virus from the laboratory over the anticipated operating lifetime of the facility. 803 Updated SSRA Other enhanced risk assessment methodologies used in the Updated SSRA comprise the use of updated epidemiological modeling and sensitivity analyses, higher-fidelity meteorological modeling, and advanced economic modeling of potential outbreaks. In addition, this Updated SSRA satisfies \u00a7\u00a71647(c)(2) and (3) by assessing the impact of surveillance, response, and mitigation plans, and providing an assessment of the overall risks associated with research involving large animal models in BSL-4 containment to assist the government in evaluation of the effectiveness of control measures and inform stakeholders on the feasibility of implementation. 10.1 Conclusions The conclusions drawn from the quantitative evaluation of all FMDv events, including event risk rankings are presented in Section 10.1.1; cumulative risk over a one-year operating period at the NBAF, and cumulative risk over the expected 50-year operating lifetime of the facility are presented in Section 10.1.2. The conclusions derived from the BSL-4 assessment are summarized and a high level comparison to the observations from the FMDv assessment is provided in Section 10.1.3. 10.1.1 Conclusions and Risk Rankings for FMDv-Related Events The estimated risk of FMDv-related accident events are determined based on the estimated event frequency (where an event is defined as a loss of containment of viable virus material that leads to an FMD infection) and the estimated economic consequences if an event were to occur. Event trees were developed for four pathways: aerosol, solid waste, liquid waste, and transference; and for four originating locations: BSL-Ag Animal Holding Rooms (AHRs), BSL-3Ag necropsy rooms, BSL-3E/BSL-3E areas. In addition, two catastrophic events were considered: tornados and earthquakes. In total, 26 event trees comprising a total of 142 events were evaluated. This section presents a summary and interpretation of the risks across the events and release pathways that were considered in this Updated SSRA. Nearly half (65/142) of the assessed FMDv events did not result in an outbreak because an insufficient quantity of viable pathogen was released from containment or an insufficient quantity of viable virus was delivered to a susceptible animal. Of the 77 events that resulted in a nonzero estimate of risk, only one generated an expected risk (the product of frequency and consequence) value greater than $0.50M, and only five others generated a mean expected value that was greater than $0.01M (see A8 for detailed risks associated with each event). The expected frequency of the FMDv infection events ( F Event), contingent upon a release, for all events resulting in a nonzero risk was never greater than 6 \u00d7 10-7 events per year (excluding catastrophic events). The relatively low risk observed across the various potential release events, originating locations, and pathways are reflective of the design, operational plans, and response practices that have been adopted or improved upon since the 15% Design and the 2010 SSRA. Virtually no risk was observed from the aerosol pathway when the event originated within containment. This finding is consistent with the large animal BSL-4 Assessment, which also indicated no credible risk 804 Updated SSRA from the aerosol pathway when the release originated within the BSL-4 containment area. This suggests that the 65% Design, which has been upgraded to include redundant double (in-series) HEPA filtration, sufficiently mitigates the risk of release of infectious material via the aerosol pathway for events originating in containment . Risks associated with solid waste pathways were very low in all events, with solid waste aggregate risk values (summed across all events within a given solid waste tree) falling between $3.8 \u00d7 10-10 and $8.2 \u00d7 10-5. These low risk values, as compared to other event trees considered in the Updated SSRA, reflect low probabilities of releases leading to infections. These low probabilities are the result of the efficacy of redundant and independent solid waste decontamination systems planned for the NBAF. The addition of redundant and independent solid waste decontamination systems in the 65% Design, including the addition of on-site incineration, has mitigated the risks of release of infectious material via the solid waste pathway from the NBAF. No risk of a liquid release resulting in an infection was observed in any area within the NBAF when the Effluent Decontamination System (EDS) cook tank was functional, regardless of whether there were failures in any other node of the waste disposal system (e.g., priming of the drains or wastewater pretreatment). In all liquid waste events with observable risk, the risks were less than $0.01M. However, the economic impact of such an event, should it occur, is significant (approximately $108B). The NBAF engineering control practice of including an independent and redundant verification indicator of cook tank performance prior to releasing liquid waste from the NBAF has mitigated the risk along this release pathway. Although the design and operational features of the NBAF incorporated in the 65% Design significantly reduced modeled risks, some risks are still present. Of the risk-generating events, two are along the aerosol pathway (these risks were limited to a loss originating outside of containment), 11 occurred along the solid waste pathway; 11 occurred along the liquid waste pathway, 51 occurred along the transference pathway, and two were due to catastrophic events. The catastrophic earthquake event was found to pose the highest risk (approximately $0.56M) of all of the events considered in this Updated SSRA. The relatively high risk value is driven by the return period of an earthquake event. The facility hardening that was performed to protect the containment areas from high wind events will likely enhance the earthquake performance of the laboratory and thereby increase the return period of an earthquake event that would cause containment failure. However, until a detailed assessment of the earthquake performance of the hardened containment area is performed, the modeled performance of the containment area is limited to the specified building code requirements. It is recognized that these modeling assumptions may have resulted in an overestimation of the extent of structural damage and thus the source term released and subsequent infections resulting from a catastrophic earthquake event but a detailed dynamic structural analysis was beyond the scope of this effort. Additional analysis on the structural and containment penetration seals for the NBAF is currently being performed to inform the risk assessment process and provide a more 805 Updated SSRA representative return period and risk calculation for the earthquake event. Note that the expected risk associated with a catastrophic tornado event is relatively low (in comparison to the earthquake event) at approximately $0.002M, indicating that the tornado hardening improvements implemented since the 2010 SSRA have greatly reduced the risk associated with a tornado. Transference events evaluated in this assessment represent the greatest fraction of all events resulting in risk. However, the transference event risks aggregated across all events are $0.05M. The events that occurred most frequently and thus occupied the greatest transference risk space are those that occurred outside of containment (OT event trees that occurred between the Transshipping Facility and the Laboratory) or were due to a full failure or disregard of procedures and a resultant fomite transfer (event ATF3). Even though the economic impact was significant for transference events that resulted in an infection, the frequency of any individual transference event was estimated to be approximately once in 2 million years ( FEven t = 5.33 \u00d7 10-7). As concluded in the 2010 SSRA and in the large animal BSL-4 assessment presented in Section 9, thorough and continuously-reinforced training and a safety-oriented workforce are key to reducing accidents from transference events, which are attributable largely to human error. The only aerosol events that resulted in observable risk (events OA2 and OA3) were those that originated outside of containment. Because this type of release was modeled as occurring outside of the NBAF building (between the Transshipping Facility and the Laboratory Building) and the source term was not reduced by the filtration of the HEPA systems, these events had a significant impact relative to some of the other modeled events. Although the overall risk of transshipping errors outside of containment leading to an aerosol release is relatively low (approximately $0.02M), the consequence of one of these events (conditional on their occurrence) are among the highest consequence events (approximately $108B). It is important to note that risks associated with receiving improperly packaged shipments containing infectious materials are not unique to the NBAF. 10.1.2 Cumulative Risk Calculations for FMDv-Related Accidents Cumulative risk estimates for the NBAF for both the first year of operation and over the 50-year expected lifetime of the facility, are presented in this section. While the risk calculations do provide useful information for ranking risks, identifying vulnerabilities, prioritizing investments, and developing response strategies, the practice of numerically estimating risk over such a long period is not recommended (but required by Public Law 112 10, \u00a71647), and care should be taken to avoid over- interpreting the cumulative risk estimate as an absolute number. Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with the estimates comprising the cumulative risk values are, in many cases, large relative to the estimated risks. The associated underlying uncertainties that contribute to the uncertainty in the cumulative risk values are detailed in Section 8. With this caveat, the estimated probability that an accidental release of viable FMDv from the NBAF will occur and cause an infection was calculated for a single year (the first year) of NBAF operation and across the 50-year lifetime. For a single year of NBAF operation, when all events are considered 806 Updated SSRA (including catastrophic events), the expected probability of at least one release resulting in an infection in a given year is 2.16 \u00d7 10-5 and the estimated range is approximately 3.07 \u00d7 10-11 to 4.23 \u00d7 10-4. When catastrophic events are excluded, the probability of at least one release resulting in an infection in a given year is estimated to be between 3.07 \u00d7 10-11 and 2.33 \u00d7 10-5 with an expected probability of 1.52 \u00d7 10-6. The cumulative risk over all events for one year was $0.7M when all events were included and $0.13M when the catastrophic events were excluded. The 50-year cumulative probability estimate is 1.08 \u00d7 10-3 (ranging from 1.54 \u00d7 10-9 to 2.35 \u00d7 10-2) when all events were included and 7.61 \u00d7 10-5 (ranging from 1.54 \u00d7 10-9 to 1.17 \u00d7 10-3) when catastrophic events were excluded. In other words, when all events are considered, the probability of at least one release resulting in an infection over the 50-year NBAF operating lifetime is estimated to be less than 0.11%. When catastrophic events are excluded, the probability of at least one release resulting in an infection over the 50-year NBAF operating lifetime is estimated to be less than 0.008%. The cumulative risk over the 50-year operating lifetime of the NBAF was $35M when all events were included and $7M when the catastrophic events were omitted. The uncertainty (standard deviation) in the 50-year cumulative risk was found to be approximately $15B, regardless of whether catastrophic events are included. In summary, the practice of numerically estimating risk over such a long period is not recommended. With this caveat, the estimated probability that an accidental release of FMDv from the NBAF will occur and result in a subsequent outbreak during the NB!F's nominal 50 -year operating life is less than 0.11%. 10.1.3 Summary of Risks Associated with Infected Livestock in BSL-4 Containment The Large Animal BSL-4 (ABSL-4) Assessment presented in Section 9 relied on a panel of domestic and international biocontainment Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), members of the NBAF Design Partnership, and risk assessment professionals to develop and analyze a set of events that represent the state- of-the\u00ad practice risks associated with handling (infected) livestock within BSL-4 containment. A total of 109 events that spanned potential loss of containment across the aerosol, liquid waste, solid waste, and transference pathways were described and the associated risks estimated. A summary of the risks observed in the ABSL-4 Assessment is provided herein; for the detailed ABLSL-4 Assessment conclusions and recommendations, refer to Section 9.10.2. In the ABSL-4 assessment, the greatest risk was identified along the transference pathway, which relies less on design elements and more on well-trained staff that comply with planned protocols, practices, and standard operating procedures (SOPs). The vast majority of the transference event risk observed in the ABSL-4 assessment was attributable to human error. This observation highlights the importance for any biocontainment laboratory, including the NBAF, to develop SOPs, plans, and practices and reinforce these practices with periodic staff training. The observable ABSL-4 risk also indicated that proper training of staff (e.g., biosafety, biosecurity, biocontainment, security, etc.) through continuing education and refresher training to ensure the understanding and compliance with 807 Updated SSRA SOPs, plans, and practices will reduce the potential for the human errors attributed to the transference events and the subsequent impact of an initial laboratory acquired infection. The ABSL-4 Assessment also concluded that, with the exception of a few improbable specific events, the NBAF 65% Design elements mitigate the risk of pathogen release along the aerosol, solid waste, and liquid waste pathways from ABSL- 4. A list of the high-level conclusions generated from the ABSL-4 Assessment includes: The risk mitigation of redundant, dual-series HEPA filtration caissons in the NBAF 65% Design provided significant protection against release along this pathway from ABSL-4 AHRs and necropsy rooms. No credible risk was identified along the aerosol release pathway from ABSL- 4 containment. This observation is consistent with that observed during the FMDv risk assessment for BSL-3Ag containment. None of the 18 liquid waste events evaluated resulted in an observable risk, implying that the NBAF planned in-facility effluent decontamination systems (in particular the cook tank) offer sufficient risk mitigation in regards to working with large animals in BSL-4 containment. This observation is consistent with that observed during the FMDv risk assessment for BSL-3Ag containment. As long as either the incinerator (for the solid fraction from the large tissue autoclaves or solid waste disposal) or the in-series autoclaves are functional, the solid waste pathway does not appear to pose observable risk. Of the solid waste pathway events that had observable risk, the greatest risk was observed when the tissue autoclave from ABSL-4 necropsy was functioning, yet the incinerator failed. This risk is reflective of the large viral load and sheer mass of material considered in the disposal of infected carcasses (as compared to non-carcass solid waste). It is also notable that the frequency of release or F Loss for the five solid waste events with observable risk ranged from 2.0 \u00d7 10-9 yr-1 to 2.0 \u00d7 10-19 yr-1. This observation is consistent with the findings of the FMDv risk assessment. The transference pathway represented the greatest associated risk across all of the AB SL-4 release pathways considered. The transference-injection and transference-respiratory specific pathways represented the greatest associated risk across all of the ABSL-4 events. In total, the ten events with the greatest risk for both Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) were observed along the transference pathway due to exposures via injection (e.g., sharps/bites), inhalation (due to loss of respiratory protection positive pressure), and contact routes. This is consistent with the FMDv assessment that indicated that the majority of the events that led to observable risk were due to transference events. The estimated risk values were somewhat variable between the two primary pathogens used to estimate the risk of working with infected livestock in ABSL-4 containment (NiV and HeV). However, the general trends were sufficiently consistent such that risk mitigation measures (e.g., administrative controls based on procedures and staff training and physical controls, which are derived from facility design parameters and installation of specified safety equipment) should reduce the frequency of fault events that led to the potential releases regardless of pathogen type, including HeV, NiV, RVFv, or other emerging agents. 808 Updated SSRA It is important to note that this is an estimate of ABSL-4 risk many factors that could influence risk (including the economic impact) are not fully characterized for the modeled pathogens or other emerging pathogens. As more information on these pathogens becomes available, the conclusions and recommendations included herein should be reevaluated and reconsidered for relevance. This work does represent a reasonable advancement in the understanding of high-containment risks associated with working on livestock (and large animals) and, at a minimum, provides a starting point for future discussions and collaborations, and provides an extensive historical overview of the potential impacts of NiV and HeV outbreaks should a release occur. 10.2 Recommendations Recommendations for consideration by DHS, USDA, and other stakeholders presented herein are intended to inform NBAF planning processes on design features, operations-related concepts, and response strategies that may help further reduce risks associated with animal and zoonotic pathogen research. Recommendations have been derived from the quantitative assessment of FMD-related research in BSL-3Ag and BSL-3E facilities (including the Special Procedure areas), and the assessment of zoonotic pathogen research in ABSL-4 facilities. The aggregated recommendations for design and construction, operational planning, and response strategies are presented in the following sections. During the performance of the Updated SSRA, two design features were identified that provided the opportunity to significantly reduce the modeled accident frequencies. These features were presented to DHS along with preliminary estimates on the risk reduction that would be achieved by implementation of the interim design recommendations. DHS agreed to incorporate the design modifications in the 100% Design and the anticipated risk mitigation achieved from these modifications was incorporated in the current assessment. The accepted recommendations are described below: Redundant temperature sensors and an independent temperature monitoring method will be integrated with all cook tanks in the Effluent Decontamination Systems (EDSs) to increase the overall confidence that liquid waste is properly treated prior to its discharge. Redundant temperature sensors and an independent temperature monitoring method will be integrated with all tissue autoclaves (carcass and tissue disposal systems) to increase the overall confidence that waste tissue is properly treated prior to the removal of residuals from the system. 10.2.1 Design and Construction From the risk assessment perspective, the NBAF 65% Design is a sound design that has no evident fundamental flaws or design features that would prohibit the implementation of the best and safest practices used in animal and zoonotic pathogen research facilities. However, additional design considerations that may enhance overall risk management efforts are submitted as recommendations (that have been accepted by DHS) below: 809 Updated SSRA 10.2.1.1 Disinfection Fixtures The development of design detail that includes the addition of dedicated disinfection fixtures in shower areas (e.g., water showers) would ensure that appropriate space is allocated for the necessary fixtures. Providing details and specification for fixture and utility requirements for the dunking process will facilitate procedure and protocol development and minimize the potential for procedural oversights or fixture improvisation. The transfer of items from higher containment levels to lower containment levels is a frequent event, and permanency of accommodating fixtures for the disinfection process is highly recommended by the Updated SSRA team. 10.2.1.2 Time Interlocked Shower Doors The specifics of practices and procedures for personnel showers (when transiting through containment levels or from high- to low-titer areas) for the NBAF will be defined before the laboratory is operational and will continue to evolve with experience and as research activities change over time. However, for the foreseeable future, biosafety practices will include prescribed shower times. It is recommended that consideration be given to incorporating time-interlocked shower doors (with emergency egress) for the containment exit shower facilities the shower facility at the exit of the BSL-3E area. A similar successful implementation in De \u0011! incorporates interlock capabilities and the addition of time sequencing should require minimal adjustments. On exit from the dirty area, the shower exit door is nominally locked for the protocol- driven shower cycle time. (Emergency egress can be accomplished if necessary.) 10.2.1.3 Earthquake Performance Analysis The facility hardening that was performed to protect the containment areas from high wind events will likely enhance the earthquake performance of the laboratory and thereby increase the return period of an earthquake event that would cause containment failure. However, since a structural analysis on the earthquake tolerance of the hardened containment area was outside the scope of this effort, a conservative approach was taken that may have overestimated the extent of structural damage (and thus the source term released) given an earthquake event. If the earthquake performance of the containment area is enhanced by the hardened structure, the risk of the loss of containment from an earthquake will be further reduced. DHS may choose to seek further collaboration with experts in earthquake structural design and tolerance analysis to refine and inform this risk further. 10.2.1.4 Beneficial Reuse Considerations Beneficial reuse practices are not being considered for the NBAF. If considered for any fraction of the containment waste stream, the practice should be methodically assessed for additional risk contributions. Results from these dedicated studies should be used to inform DHS and USDA biosafety officials, management, and responsible officials so that appropriate mitigation and control measures can be incorporated in the decision process (e.g., costs, risks, and benefits). Specifically, marginal risks from the reuse of solids (e.g., sludge, activated sludge, etc.) from the on-site wastewater pretreatment facility should be assessed before supporting infrastructure or operational plans are developed. 810 Updated SSRA 10.2.2 Operational Planning With regard to operational planning, it is recommended that the operational planning cycle include emergency and incident response stakeholders and that plans (upon completion) be available for stakeholder review and contribution. As DHS and USDA develop and modify NBAF SOPs, plans, and practices, it is recommended that DHS and USDA provide periodic training on the developing SOPs, plans, and practices with current staff members to begin the adaptation and familiarization of potential new processes and identify opportunities for optimization of the developing documentation. DHS has performed similar practices for the transition of some U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) activities to the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC). Such training can be accomplished while engaging the workforce and enhancing worker satisfaction. Initial and continued training of NBAF staff in biosafety, biosecurity, biocontainment, and security practices will enhance understanding of and compliance with NBAF SOPs, plans, and practices that will ultimately reduce the potential for human errors that contributed to most of the observed transference event risks. Accelerated staff training on emerging SOPS, plans, and practices will also reinforce and enhance current biosafety practices and facilitate the smooth transition from PIADC to the NBAF similar to the USAMRIID to NBACC activities mentioned above. The specific types of SOPs and training recommended (based on conclusions from the FMDv and ABSL-4 assessments) include: Necropsy skills and techniques that minimize sharps hazards; Techniques on the optimization of movement and maintaining safe working distances from animals to minimize the potential for PPE damage and physical injury; Continuous PPE checks and maintenance; Best practices on working with livestock in containment, including sedation practices, and squeeze chute and pen operation; Decontamination procedures for workers and potential fomites; and Methods and procedures for proper exposure reporting and medical response procedures. Releases that occurred outside of containment, whether through the aerosol pathway or through transference of material on persons or via fomites, provide a unique set of circumstances (e.g., failure of packaging materials and subsequent release of viable pathogen) that can be mitigated using a number of approaches. The following suggestions for mitigating the risks associated with receipt and handling of improperly packaged infectious pathogens should be considered: Develop practices and procedures that reduce handling of and exposure to potentially infectious packages outside of containment, such as using staff in the transshipping sample receipt area who are fully trained in the safe handling and containment of infectious materials; publishing 811 Updated SSRA shipping guidelines and requirements, and requesting specified sample containers be used when sending samples to the NBAF; dedicating disposable clothing and footwear to the Transshipping Facility; and requiring clothing and footwear change, and complete shower-out (similar to that performed when exiting the BSL-3Ag AHRs) before exiting the Transshipping Facility after contact with sample containers. 10.2.3 Response Planning Based on the risks observed in the Updated SSRA and the time commitment required to build new relationships and coordinate with existing stakeholders, it is recommended that DHS accelerate the response planning efforts beyond those identified in the \"NB!F O&M Establishment Timeline\" (Figure 1.1.7-1) to the extent practical, and to facilitate response planning efforts. The response planning efforts are motivated by FMD concerns that are not all related to NBAF and the planning effort will benefit many stakeholders. In order to achieve the goals of an FMD response to (1) detect, control, and contain FMD in animals as quickly as possible; (2) eradicate FMD using strategies that seek to stabilize animal agriculture, the supply, and the economy while protecting public health; and (3) provide science- and risk-based approaches and systems to facilitate continuity of business for non-infected animals and non- contaminated animal products, one or more response strategies may need to be employed at any time during an outbreak. The strategies employed may vary by region, species, or other defining characteristic. In each case, the decision and application of a specific response strategy or strategies will be based on considering many criteria, and will require the coordination and involvement of numerous entities. In the event of FMD detection, USDA and the affected states and tribal nations will work together in a Unified Command, per NIMS, to detect, control, and contain FMD as expeditiously as possible. Detection of FMD in the U.S. will result in emergency intervention by state, tribal, and federal authorities. Specifically, any response strategy or strategies regarding emergency vaccination need to be approved by the U.S. CVO prior to implementation, with agreement from the SAHO and the Unified Command Incident Commander. Choosing one vaccination strategy, multiple strategies, or modifying strategies as an outbreak unfolds is an important, but very complex decision process. Depending upon the circumstances and scale of the outbreak, a combination of one or more of the response strategies may be applied. It is recommended that a publicly-available vaccination response plan be provided early on to allow proper coordination and weigh-in of all stakeholders and, if possible, to evaluate, estimate, and/or discuss the effectiveness, benefits, or detriments of the various response strategies under consideration prior to implementation during an emergency event. To mitigate the risks to public and veterinary health identified in the ABSL-4 Assessment, it is recommended that initial response planning efforts comprise a high-level description of the process for working with the medical and veterinary health organizations and facilities within and around the NBAF (such as Mercy Regional Health Center, University of Kansas Hospital, local veterinarians, etc.) 812 Updated SSRA to establish the capability and capacity to rapidly respond to Nipah, Hendra, or other zoonotics such that proper detection, diagnosis, treatment, and other medical response (such as contact precautions, etc.) are initiated as soon as possible should an exposure or infection occur. The sensitivity analysis and cost-benefit analysis performed during the quantitative FMDv epidemiological modeling indicated the following strategies were effective at reducing the extent of an outbreak and should be considered for inclusion to response planning efforts for the NBAF. Investments to achieve the predicted culling capacity are critical for FMD outbreak mitigation, and further investments to improve culling capacity were beneficial no matter how large the outbreak was or where it initiated. It is suggested that the NBAF response plans outline an approach to, at a minimum, achieve the predicted culling capacity in Kansas and the surrounding states. Investments to reduce the degree of direct and indirect contact between infected and susceptible farms after an outbreak were beneficial in reducing the extent of outbreaks. It is suggested that NBAF response plans include and define approaches and methods to be used to reduce direct and indirect contact between infected farms and susceptible farms during an outbreak of FMD. Despite the fact that early detection of an outbreak can greatly mitigate its effects, current technologies related to air samplers, sentinel herds, and active surveillance were of limited value because these systems were unlikely to signal that an outbreak has occurred or will occur given the specific releases modeled from the NBAF. However, the advancement of related surveillance technologies and associated implementation strategies may significant change this observation. It is suggested that DHS, USDA, and other stakeholders continue to invest in surveillance technologies that provide more benefit that current systems. The epidemiological assessment indicated that producer education campaigns that incentivize producers to observe animals for suspicious signs, enable them to recognize the signs of FM D as suspicious, and encourage them to call a veterinarian when the signs are first observed, could significantly reduce the impact of an outbreak. It is recommended that NBAF response plans include and define the goals, approach, and program of instruction for a producer education campaign (or similar instruction effort as described above) for the state of Kansas and the NBAF region. 10.2.4 Recommendations Summary Table The Updated SSRA recommendations for consideration by DHS and USDA are summarized in Table 10.2.5- 1. 813 Table 10.2.5 -1: Updated SSRA Recommendations Summary No. Description Status 1 Add permanent disinfection fixtures to the design in shower (water) areas Accepted between containment levels. 2 Incorporate time -interlocked doors in shower area between the BSL -3E Accepted containment area and non -containment. 3 Assess the enhanced earthquake performance that may be derived from the Accepted structural hardening and containment penetration specifications added for the high -wind and tornado design mit igations for the benefit of future risk assessments. 4 Perform additional analyses, as needed, prior to incorporating beneficial reuse Accepted into designs and plans. 5 Continue to include outside emergency and incident response stakeholders in Accepted the operational planning cycle and distribute plans (upon completion) for review and additional contributions. 6 Begin periodic training on newly developed and evolving NBAF SOPs, plans, and Accepted practices. 7 Develop practices and procedure s that reduce handling of and exposure to Accepted potentially infectious packages outside of containment. 8 Accelerate response planning efforts while including emergency and incident Accepted response stakeholders (Recommendation 5) and appropriate interested en tities. 9 To the extent possible, make vaccination response plans publicly available .

Updated SSRA 814 Updated SSRA 10.3 Continuing Risk Management and Advancements Following the 2010 SSRA DHS is committed to the development and implementation of continuing risk management practices. The continuing practices will be described in a DHS plan that is currently under development. The plan is based on a continuous improvement model as illustrated in Figure 10.3-1. Each risk assessment iteration is used to inform the NBAF program, which may then adjust plans as needed to accommodate identified risks. Enhanced fidelity for conceptual facility models are then used with improved modeling tools and newly collected data to model the risk mitigation achieved by the adjusted plans. Results from the updated modeling are used to assess the adjusted risks and again inform the program. Implementation of this model will allow DHS and other stakeholders to ensure that resources are being used to most effectively address identified risks and identify new risks that may arise from other design changes or updated plans. Figure 10.3-1: Iterative Risk Model 10.3.1 Implementation of 2010 SSRA Recommendations The 2010 SSRA provided 17 specific recommendations for the mitigation of risks for the NBAF in the areas of design and engineering, operations planning, and response strategies. DHS and USDA have implemented or are in the process of implementing or addressing all 17 of these recommendations. These implemented changes are reflected in the Updated SSRA. Specifically, DHS has incorporated all design recommendations into the 65% Design. DHS continues to work with USDA to formulate operating strategies to address the operations planning recommendations, and has made progress on the collaboration processes required to coordinate federal, state, and local responders on response planning strategies. A summary of the SSRA recommendations and the DHS responses is presented in Table 10.3- 1. 815 Updated SSRA Table 10.3 -1: Summary of 2010 SSRA Recomme ndations and DHS Responses No. Recommendation DHS Response 1 DHS should initiate the development of NBAF staff training programs as soon as is practically possible. The control of fomites, vectors, carriers, and laboratory acquired infections is one of the most important elements of risk control for the facility. DHS continues to work with USDA to formulate operating strategies for the NBAF. DHS has established a Research and Transition Working Group; has continued stakeholder engagements to ensure full understanding by local and regional community of the NBAF mission; and has established baseline biosafety guidelines for incorporation into design basis and standard operating procedures. 2 DHS should convene professionals from the design DHS held special meetings and used team and other subject matter experts to explor e all additional expertise to assess all carca ss of the options available to the NBAF for carcass disposal technologies and identify the disposal systems.

When access to the containment block is required (e.g., FADD students), strict escort protocols must be followed and visitors must be provided with ingress/egress training and/or supe rvision. DHS continues to work with USDA to formulate operating strategies for the NBAF.

Updated SSRA 10.3.2 NBAF Design Evolution DHS and USDA program representatives and the NBAF Design Partnership began the site-specific design process in June 2009. The project team has worked together for the purpose of creating a design that maximizes the safety and security aspects of the NBAF. As indicated above and illustrated in Table 10.3-1, DHS has proactively addressed all 17 of the 2010 SSRA recommendations regarding design considerations. In addition to addressing these recommendations, the NBAF 65% Design complies with or exceeds all modern biocontainment design principles, standards, and applicable biocontainment facility codes and requirements \u2014specifically with regard to redundancy recommendations on room exhaust air filtration. Advancements from the 15% Design to the 65% Design include, but are not limited to, the following features: 10.3.2.1 Redundant HEPA Caissons and Autoscan Capability The NAS SSRA Committee expressed concern about the lack of complete redundant capacity for the double (series) HEPA laboratory exhaust air filtration from areas with an elevated risk for aerosolized pathogens. In the 65% Design, redundancy for all elevated risk areas is provided (2N for smaller rooms and N+1 for larger rooms). The addition of built-in HEPA autoscan functionality will enhance the ability to monitor HEPA performance. 819 Updated SSRA 10.3.2.2 Carcass Disposal Recommendation #2 from the 2010 SSRA was to identify a different carcass disposal technology to potentially replace the carcass incineration method. After considerable study and deliberation, DHS and the NBAF Design Partnership, in consultation with other experts, selected another proven carcass disposal technology that addressed the concerns noted in the 2010 SSRA. The selected technology (large tissue autoclave) is capable of processing and dehydrating carcasses and other waste materials without some of the integration complications inherent to incinerators. The identification and incorporation of this technology satisfies SSRA Recommendation #2. 10.3.2.3 On-Site Wastewater Pretreatment The that DHS consider adding an on-site sanitary sewage waste retention system to accommodate the accumulation of sewage during a denial of service without causing undo risk to the experiments or the environment (SSRA Recommendation #7). Subsequent developments (e.g., upcoming regulatory requirements and the selection of a different carcass disposal technology) drove the NBAF Design Partnership and DHS to add an on-site wastewater pretreatment facility as described above. Additional storage capacity for disinfected liquid effluent and the addition of this new on-site wastewater pretreatment system satisfies the intent of SSRA Recommendation #7. 10.3.2.4 Potable Water The SSRA also recommended that the NBAF have access to emergency potable water supplies to accommodate safe laboratory and containment operations (and shutdown) in the event of temporary denial of routine service (SSRA Recommendation #11). DHS and the NBAF Design Partnership have added 60,000 gallons of storage capacity and have made arrangements with the municipality to provide a 12-hour reserve of potable water if the need arises to address this recommendation. 10.3.2.5 Tornado Hardening The 2010 SSRA presented two recommendations (SSRA Recommendations #5 and #6) related to \u0011! e by a tornado without containment loss. DHS and the NBAF Design Partnership developed a plan that provides a nearly equivalent level of protection to that required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for U.S. nuclear power plants. This high standard was selected because there are no prevailing standards for biocontainment laboratories. Current design standards for biocontainment facilities, such as the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5 th Edition, do not identify specific requirements for facility hardening for high-wind events [USDHHS/CDCP, 2007]. DHS, however, directed the NBAF Design Partnership to establish appropriate design criteria to provide high confidence that the facility will maintain containment during and after a credible high-wind event. The NBAF comprises a tornado-hardened zone (Figure 2.4.5-1) that would protect the BSL-3E, BSL-3Ag, and BSL-4 laboratories from loss of containment resulting from a tornado strike with winds of 228 mph. Section 8 of the 65% Design provides full details on the analysis used to establish the new design requirements. Section 5 provides an assessment of credible high-wind events and the potential loss of pathogenic materials resulting from such events. 820 Updated SSRA 10.3.3 DHS/USDA Operational and Response Planning Since publication of the 2010 SSRA, DHS has initiated or continued the following activities to further advance operational and response planning: Continued to engage the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) to leverage 60 years of operating experience, knowledge, and planning documents; Leveraged and applied information from a highly successful CDC/USDA inspection of the National Biodefense and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) laboratory to support planning efforts; Engaged and continues to engage with local and regional emergency responders to initiate Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) for needed response capabilities; Established the Research and Transition Working Group to begin formulating training requirements; Continued stakeholder engagements to ensure full understanding by local and regional community of the NBAF mission; and Established appropriate baseline biosafety guidelines for incorporation into design basis and standard operating procedures. DHS has also started the development of the initial operating capability (IOC) of the NBAF in preparation for the migration of personnel, equipment, and operations from the PIADC facility. In collaboration with USDA, DHS is in the beginning stages of developing the NBAF Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The NBAF ERP will provide guidance and direction to assure an integrated and coordinated response to emergency situations at the NBAF. The ERP will include the delineated steps and actions needed for mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery and will provide guidance and direction to assure an integrated and coordinated response to emergencies at the NBAF. While DHS has started the development of operational and response plans, it has been purposefully slow to publish protocols, practices, and strategies. With laboratory commissioning and operations still several (7-8) years away, there is adequate time to develop, review, and inculcate scientific users, personnel, and response stakeholders without the risk of prematurely developing plans that many not be relevant when the facility is finally constructed. As research priorities and technology advance, it is important to have practices and procedures that represent the best available at the time of commissioning and operation. In addition, there may be some concerns about the enhancement of strategic risks related to public disclosure of sensitive information on U.S. countermeasure programs. However, as described above, the collaborative process is underway. 10.3.4 Response to NAS SSRA Committee Findings DHS and the Updated SSRA have addressed the NAS SSRA Committee Findings that are summarized in Table 10.3.4-1. AppendixB1 provides the detailed comments received from the NAS SSRA Committee and references the section(s) where each comment is specifically addressed in the Updated SSRA. 821 Table 10.3.4 -1: NAS SSRA Committee Findings Summary and DHS/Updated SSRA Response Finding Description DHS Response 1 The 2010 SSRA lacks evidence to The 2010 SSRA did not attempt to quantify the support the conclusion that the risk of FMD infection from an external source.
