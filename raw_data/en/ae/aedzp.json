How these herbs and spices are used for love magic Once a spell caster asks for the above plants, they will be specific on what part of the plant you will bring. Depending on the love back spell, you may be asked to bring the seeds, flowers, roots, leaves, fruits, or even the entire live plant. Whatever the spell caster requests, please make sure that you deliver. And if you are unable, tell them straight up so that they will know what to do. So much so, when you have a request like I need a spell caster to bring back my lover, expect the spell caster to use these plants in the following ways: They will dry the plants Spellcaster Maxim and others in this profession might keep the plant and let them wilt. Others would save them for some other use. But one thing is for sure: they will save those plants and return them to their clients as ingredients of the return ex-lover spells. The wilting of the plant might symbolize the end of your mystery and also the timeline of the spell. Meaning that once it is completely dry, the return ex-lover spell will have taken effect. Some might even ask you which part you prefer because it gives power to the return ex-lover spells if they make incantations from actual parts used by the person who requests return love spells. In most cases, people go with flowers and leaves though there are times when someone asks for seeds or roots. The spellcaster might make powder from the plant Another possible way they will use these plants is to crush them into a paste of powder. A spellcaster might utilize this residue by making a pill or charm using it. The return love spells practitioners shape it into a rounded pill, which they then put in a red cloth and store inside the new return spell. The return ex-lover spells casters can also make incantations over this fabric to charge its contents with their return lover magic. After that, their return love spells make sure you carry or wear them everywhere you go for five days. The return ex-lover spells caster might also recommend you to take off your clothes before wearing this charm out of the house because it has to touch your skin directly. This is a practice to strengthen the herbs. Others might instruct you to feed this powder to the target; others might ask you to spray it to make them inhale it. Others might simply instruct you to draw a line outside their door, and once they skip it, they become instantly enchanted. Spellcasters might use it to make a liquid portion Spellcasters might speak some words to the plant and instruct you to boil the spices and herns to make a portion. In this case, they offer you strict rules: what to use, what to add, and where to place it. Your spellcaster will give you the best recommendations based on their own experience. Regardless of what the spice is, you may be asked to ingest or apply it on your skin for it to activate a spell to bring two lovers together. The spellcaster might ask you to keep the plant and nature it In some cases, the plant that you took for an easy spell to bring a lover back might all depend on the life of that plant. And this means that as long as the plant stays alive, your lover stays put, and your love blossoms. Just like the plant, your relationship will need watering, naturing and caring. So much so, when you do this to the plant, it reflects on your life. You will often have to grow the plant in a piece of land that you frequently visit to care for the plant. Caution: Make sure that you are not allergic to any of the ingredients before attempting this spell; better yet, at least do a patch test just to be safe before attempting this spell combination.
