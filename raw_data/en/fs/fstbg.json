Castle Student Research Conference Department of Chemistry University of South Florida 2006 1 Fifth Annual Raymond N. Castle Student Research Conference Department of Chemistry University of South Florida 2006 2Welcome Welcome to the Fifth Annual Raymond N. Castle Student Research Conference. In honor of Dr. Raymond N. Castle, this conference was creat ed to promote his goals of scientific collaboration and science education. A pi oneer in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, Dr. Castle published well over 200 articles, incl uding collaborations with other USF Department of Chemistry resear chers, Andrew S. Zektzer, Milton Johnston, and Ron Federspiel, as well as chemists from Japan. On this year's cover, Dr. Castle's synthetic efforts are illustrated through hi s heterocyclic molecule, dimethyl 2-(p- toluenesulfonylamino)-3-cyano-4-imino- 1,4-dihydropyridine-5,6- dicarboxylate. The Raymond N. Castle Conference was designed to be organized by students for students as an excellent opportunity for bot h undergraduate and graduate students to present their scientific research in a familiar, amiable environment, as well as provide leadership experience for those interested in the conference organiza tion. Students within the department are encouraged to not only gain presentation experience and hone their communication skills to effectively convey thei r results to a broad audience, but also to discover more about their colleagues' research. We encourage everyone to take advantage of this opportunity and attend both the poster and oral presentations. Additionally, we are all excite d to attend our plenary lectur e, and we are particularly grateful to have Dr. William Wulff, Professo r of Chemistry at Michigan State University as our plenary speaker and distinguished guest. Lastly, I would like to personally tha nk all of the committee members involved for their help in the coordination of this ye ar's event.

Awards Ceremony 8Professor Raymond N. Castle 1916 - 1999 Raymond N. Castle was born on June 24, 1916, in Boise, Idaho where he attended Boise High School and Boise Junior College. A 1938 graduate in pharmacy from the University of Idaho, Southern Branch, in Pocatello, he completed the M.A. degree in Chemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1941. Shortly thereafter, he became a Chemistry instructor at the University of Idaho, then in 1943, returned to the University of Colorado in Boulder for a Ph.D. in Chemistry with a minor in Microbiology. After two years as a research chemist at the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, Dr. Castle accepted a position at the University of New Mexico as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry. He served as chairman of the Chemistry Department from 1963 until 1970, before moving to Brigham Young University as Professor of Chemistry. In 1981, Dr. Castle joined the faculty at University of South Florida as a Distinguished Research Professor. He and his wife, Ada, have been a vibrant part of the Chemistry Department and for many years sponsored the Castle Lecture Series, which brought in numerous prominent scientists for lectures at USF. A prolific researcher, Dr. Castle was an internationally recognized father figure in heterocyclic chemistry, both for his research and his involveme nt in meetings, symposia, and editorial boards. In 1964 he founded the Journal of Heterocyclic Chem istry and served as its editor. He also edited the Lectures in Heterocyclic Chemistry series, a publication of plenary lectures given at the International Congresses of Heterocyclic Chemistry, and as the American advisory editor for the English translation of the Russian Journal of Heterocyclic Compounds. He was in great demand as a speaker, lecturing at hundreds of institutions worldwide. He was general chairman of the First International Congress of Heterocyclic Chem istry held in Albuquerque (1967), secretary of the Second International Congress held in Montpellier, France (1969), vice-president of subsequent congresses held in Sendai, Japan, Salt Lake City, Utah, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, and Tehran, Iran. He was chairman and committee memb er for the American Chemical Society. In addition, he was cofounder of the International Society of Heterocyclic Chemistry, which he served as chairman of the executive committee, and president (1973-1975). Professor Castle received numerous awards and honors, including the prestigious International Award in Heterocyclic Chemistry (1983) for outstanding contributions to the field of heterocyclic chemistry, presented in Tokyo, Japan. Dr. Castle was listed in the first edition of Who's Who in World Science and in Who's Who in the World. The Chemistry Department remains deeply indebted to Professor Castle for his many outstanding contributions to the Department, and to science ove rall. He would have been a strong supporter of this student symposium, and thus, it is fitting that we dedicate this and future symposia to his memory. 9 Dr. Dean F. Martin, Special Thanks Dean F. Martin is Distinguished Service Professor and Director of the Institute for Environmenta l Studies at the University of South Florida, where he has been a member of the faculty since 1964. Dr. Martin received his B.A ., with Honors, from Grinnell College (1955), where he met hi s future wife Barbara while both were chemistry majors. They were married in 1956 while both attended Pennsylvania Stat e University as graduate students and in 1958 Dr. Martin received his Ph.D. and Mrs. Martin her Masters degree. In 1958-59, he was a National Science Foundation Post-Doctoral Fellow at University College, London after which he re turned to the States and accepted a faculty position at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, as Instructor and Assistant Professor of Inorganic Chem istry (1959-1964). He received (1969-1974) a Career Development Award from the Division of General Medical Sciences, NIH, to study the chemistry and chemical environment of algal toxins. In 1970-71, he was a Visiting Professor of Physiology and Pharmaco logy at Duke University Medical Center. Dr. Martin and his wife share research interests concerned w ith the coordination chemistry of natural water systems, including problems of red tide and aquatic weeds and they have collaborated in research involving th e properties of coordination compounds, as well as aspects of environmental chemis try. Currently, they are investigating the removal of arsenic by means of supported ch elated iron compounds. D ean Martin is the author or co-author of over 300 publications , including four books. He was the recipient of the 1975 Florida Award and the 1987 Civic Service Award of the Florida Section, ACS; in 1978, he received the F. J. Zimmerm ann Award in Environmental Science from the Central Wisconsin Section, sponsored by Zimpro Inc.; and in 1983, he was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Dean and Barbara Martin were the co-recipients of the 1994 Medalist Award of the Florida Academy of Sciences, its highest award. Dean Martin has been active in the Florida Section of the American Chemical Society (Chairman,1986), a nd he has held several positions in the Aquatic Plant Management Society (Presi dent,1986-87). Both of the Martins have received the Alumni Award of Grinnell College. The Martins have personally funded the George Bursa Award given annually to a deserving graduate student within the Ch emistry Department who has demonstrated notable professional dedication and considera tion for others, as well as a Graduate Student Travel Award the past two years. In addition, they ha ve been the benefactors of the annual Barbara and Dean Martin Lectur e Series. Together the Martins have edited Florida Scientist since January 1984. Dr. Martin ini tiated and continues to edit the departmental newsletter and has written a de partmental history to coincide with the 40 th Anniversary of the founding of the department. The Martins have six children; Diane, Bruce, John, Pa ul, Brian, and Eric, and four grandchildren. 10PLENARY SPEAKER William Dean Wulff Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA Prof. Wulff is currently a Professor of Chemistry at Michigan State University. He finished his B.S. at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire in 1971, and obtained his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from Iowa State University in 1979. He was granted an NIH Postdoctoral Fellowship to Princeton, and then he accepted his first Assistant Professor position in 1980 at the University of Chicago. Since then, he has moved to Mich igan State Universit y, and has developed diverse research interests, including methodology developm ent, macrocyclic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, the total synthe sis of natural products, supramolecular chemistry, and the design and develo pment of catalysts. PLENARY SEMINAR \"CATALYSE ASYMETRIQUE INSPIRE \u00b4AU NATUREL \" This talk will describe a new chiral catalyst (chemzyme) for the formation of aziridines from the reaction of imines w ith diazo compounds and the formation of dihydropyridinones from a hetero Diels-Alde r reaction of imines with dienes. The development of the chiral catalysts used in these reaction was inspired by the natural product gossypol. Gossypol is a natural product that is isolated from cotton seeds and exists in optically pure form. It is related in structure to the widely used and successful chiral ligand BINOL. The difference is that in gossypol the biaryl linkage is at the 2 and 2'-positions of the naphthalene core whereas , in BINOL, it is at th e 1 and 1'-positions. Inspired by this natural pr oduct, we set out to prepare and evaluate the two ligands VANOL and VAPOL as ligands in asymmetric synthesis and these results will be presented. 11 Session Schedule 9:00 - 9:20 Matt Lebar \"Chemical transformations Cheney \"Solid-State Synthesis of Im ides via Mechanochemistry\" Induced Ne urodegenerative 11:30 - 11:40 Break Afternoon Session (CHE 100) 2:40 - 3:00 Pasha Khan \" Chemoenzymatic synthesis of bicycle[3.1.0]hexane compounds\" 3:00 a Copolymer in Aqueous Medium 3:40 - 4:00 Christine Neipert \" Theoretical Development and Applicati on of a Computationally Amenable Sum Vibrational Frequency Theory (SVF)\" 4:00 - 4:10 Break 4:10 - 4:30 Sumedh Parulekar \" Novel Approach to manipulate th e Cavity Size in Resorcinarenes\" 124:30 - 4:50 Praveen Ramaraju \"Penicillin bound nanoparticles: A wa y to overcome drug resistance in bacteria\" 4:50 - 5:10 William Tay \"Binding of the Flavonoid Quercetin: Implica tions in Drug Design toward Prevention and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease\" 5:10 - 5:30 Chien-yi (Erin) Wu \"Nickel Derivative of Streptomyces griseu s Aminopeptidase: The Importance of Metals in Bio-Hydrolysis\" 5:30 Awards Ceremony The Barbara and Dean F.

This antibiotic is used to treat mainly livestock and other animals. Tylo sin has been subjected to many different chemical transformations. Each product of these reactions has been analyzed to determine its structure. Tylosin shares similar structural characteristics with a new compound isolated in our lab, palmerolide A. Palmerolide A, however, is only obtained in small quantities. Because tylosin mimics certain functionalities of palmerolide A, it should react similarly and thus can be used as a predictive tool. Techniques will be perfected on tylosin, and then performed with confidence on palmerolide environment frie ndly compounds and s ynthetic routes, The stress has been given on chemo-enzymatic synthesis of glycolipid analogs. These analogs were common disaccharides (Maltose, Lactose, mellibiose and cellobiose) as starting material and exploiting the regioselectivity of lipases. 9:40 - 10:00 Miranda L. Cheney \"Solid-State Synthesis of Imides via Mechanochemistry\" The emergence of green chemistry in the early 1990's has lead to the development of many new methods for synthetic chemistry. The focus of this contribution will be to expl ore the use of mechanochemistry and other \"green\" techniques for solid-s tate synthesis with particular emphasis upon generation of the imide moiety. The significance of the utilization of co-crystals in solid-sta te synthesis via crystal engineering will be established as well as the pot ential applications of imides as active pharmaceutical ingredients dinuclear been found to perform interesting alterna tive catalyses, with the ability to enormous catalytic in terms the first-order rate constant (kcat/k0= 0.94-67 billion and 0.043-0.29 million, respectively). Study of the alternative catalyses of SgAP may provide further insight into its mechanism that is otherwise not obtainable by the use of the regular peptide substrates. To demonstrated this concept further, we have investigated the di-Cu(II) deriva tive of this enzyme oxidase substrate, 3,5-di-t-butyl- catechol. Significant activity was observ ed with rate constants of kcat = 1.45 s-1, Km = 0.44 mM, and kcat/Km = 3,300 M-1 10:20 10:50 \" 'Surfactant-free' Nanopartic les for Delivery of Antibiotics\" Recent research in our laboratory ha s centered on the development of polyacrylate and polyacrylamide na noparticles prepared in water emulsions. Our goal is to use these nanoparticle emulsions for treatment of life-threatening bacteria l infections such as those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis. One of the problems we have en countered with these polymeric antibiotics is that the surfactant us ed for the polymerizations can leach away from the nanoparticle in hi gh enough concentrations to cause cytotoxic effects in human fibroblast cells. To circumvent this, we are investigating the develo pment of new types of nanoparticles in which the surfactant molecule is covalent ly attached to th e backbone of the polymer. The synthesis and characteri zation of these \"surfactant-free\" nanoparticle systems, and their app lication to drug delivery, will be discussed. 1910:50 - 11:10 Jaime Heimbegner \"Chemical Investigation of Synoicum adareanum\" Many plants and animals that lack th e ability to flee in response to predatory attack have evolved chemical defense systems. These chemical substances, which are ofte n toxic or noxious to predators, have been of interest in biomedi cal studies since many of them have been shown to be effective in the treatment of human diseases. We have been studying Antarctic marine invertebrates for the presence of such natural products. Synoicum adarea num is a sea squirt (tunicate) endemic to the waters of Antarctica and can be found in abundance near the U.S. research station (Palmer Station) on the Antarctic Peninsula. Chemical investigation of this marine invertebrate has revealed that its natural product dive rsity is broad, including polyketide macrolides (more commonly familiar as the antibiotic erythromycin), glucoshpingolipids (structurally re lated to fats), and steroids (structurally related to cholesterol) , all of which have very different structural features as well as functions within the organism. This paper reports on our chemical investigat ion of Synoicum adareanum, more specifically focusing on the descript ion of these three structurally diverse series of natural products , the majority of which are new compounds to science. 11:10 - 11:30 Kashmir Juneja \"Natural Antioxidant Inhibition of Copper Induced Neurodegenerative Diseases\" Many plants and animals that lack the ability to flee in response to predatory attack have evolved chemical defense systems.

We have accomplished synthesis of bicyclo[3.1.0]hexene systems using much milder to produce the title compounds in high enantiomeri c excess (> 97%). Compounds containing these bicyclic rings are known to inhibit alpha-mannosidase, an enzyme involved in oligosacchar ide processing and are present in carboxycyclopropyl glycines that have shown to have antipsychotic effects in animal models. Unlike methods describing assembly of such system mainly via Simmons-Smith r eaction or its modification or via Rh-catalyzed carbene insertion react ion, which are difficult because of the toxic and explosive nature of the reagents, the chemoenzymatic strategy developed in our laboratories utilizes mild reactions conditions and non toxic catalysts. 3:00 - 3:20 Sampath Abeylath \" and studi ed by a number of methods. The effect of different sugar groups a nd linker units on the physical and microbiological properties of these new drug delivery vehicles will be discussed. 3:20 - 3:40 Vasiliki Lykourinou \" Phenol Hydroxylation and Copolymer in Aqueous Medium A Cu 2+ -polymer system exhibits a very effective activity toward phenol hydroxylation/oxidation to yi eld o-quinone in 50% aqueous methanol solution at pH 8.0 and 25 \u00b0C, showing first-order rate acceleration of 6.0 \u00b4 105 and 7.8\u00b4 104 folds. The catalyst is active in presence of oxygen and in presence of hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic efficiency towards various phenolic substrates will be presented along with the proposed mechanism of action based on kinetic studies performe d 21 3:40 - 4:00 Christine Neipert \" Theoretical Development and Appl ication of a Computationally Amenable Sum Vibrational Frequency Theory (SVF)\" SVF is a second order spectroscopy th at is dipole forbidden in bulk media, and hence is a useful tool for probing exclusively interfacial molecular species in the condensed phase. By considering only the dominant terms of the second order susceptibility that will become resonant with the applied fields, a correlation function approach can be developed to calculate the resulti ng interfacial spectra. Using this correlation function approach, we determine the spectra of an air/water interface, and compare our result to extant experiment. 4:00 - 4:10 Break 4:10 - 4:30 Sumedh Parulekar \" Novel Approach to manipulate the Cavity Size in Resorcinarenes\" Resorcinarenes have been used as metal complexing agents, sensors, receptors, molecular reaction vessels and catalytic chambers. They are able to encapsulate small neutral molecules, drug molecules. Such cavitands offer unique molecular plat forms for host-guest chemistries, as well as new polymers and self-assembled systems. A facile and efficient synthesis of these novel resorcinarenes containing hydroxyl groups and allyl groups can be accomplished in few steps beginning from commercially available re sorcinols and th e corresponding aldehydes followed by chromatographic separations and recrystallization. Their structures are confirmed by spectroscopic techniques. Ring Closing Metathes is in the presence of Grubbs' catalyst has been used as an effici ent approach to synthesize allyloxy resorcinarene in the cone c onformation with upper rim allyl substituents. Octaallyl cavitands may undergo conformational changes in all direction, but ring formation of allyl group gives rigid enforced concave cavity to hold neutral molecule in it. 22 4:30 - 4:50 Praveen Ramaraju \"Penicillin bound nanoparticles: A poten tial way drug resistance in bacteria\" Penicillin is a beta-lactam antibioti c commonly used for the treatment of bacterial infections. However, antibiotic-resistant bacteria have emerged in hospitals throughout the world that are able to destroy penicillin, and thus cause lethal infec tions. This resistance is due to the production of beta-lactamase proteins, enzymes which hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring of penicillin to render the drug in active. We are developing an approach to recover the effectiveness of penicillin through the use of polyacrylate na noparticles. These nanoparticle penicillins, or nanopenicillins, serv e as delivery vehicles that also protect the sensitive drug within its interior, enabling us to rejuvenate these important, life-saving antibioti cs for use against dangerous drug- resistant bacteria. 4:50 - 5:10 William Tay \"Binding of the Flavonoid Querce tin: Implications in Drug Design toward Prevention and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease\" Penicillin is a beta-lactam antibioti c commonly used for the treatment of bacterial infections.

Th is unique structural feature allows us to gain further insight into how different metal ions interact with proteins. The aminopeptidase from Streptomyces griseus (SgAP) contain a di-Zn(II) center in the act ive site. By comparing the native form of SgAP with its di-metal de rivatives afford more information about the action of this enzyme, such as substrate specificity. Moreover, further investigation of the metal derivatives will also provide insight into the catalytic pr omiscuity of this enzyme and its metal derivatives. Thus, we can use SgAP as a model system to gain further understanding about how metal ions change catalytic properties of metalloenzyme. 5:30 Awards Ceremony 24 POSTER EXHIBIT ABSTRACTS 25The Barbara and Dean F.

Kenny Aristide; Alfredo Cardenas \"Computational Study of Folding Pathways of Oxygen Sensing Heme Proteins\" The objective of our resear ch is to determine the conformational changes upon ligand unbinding of the Dos protein of the bacterium Escherichia coli (EcDos). Structurally resolved recently, EcDos is a heme-based signal protein responsible for phosphodiesterase activity. We examined two forms of EcDos, the oxygen-bound form and the deoxy form (Prote in Data Bank ID 1V9Z and 1VB6 respectively). Using Moil9, a molecular modeling softwa re, and specifically the Stochastic Difference Equation in length algorithm (SDEL), we were able to attain trajectories connecting these two fo rms of the natural protein. Our present study provides dynamical struct ure information for the conformational changes of EcDos that the one simply revealed for the experimental static structures. Our results could provide insight as to how exactly this protein transmit signals to other proteins. 2. Kyle Belknap; Monica Elmashat; Sa ira Gardezi; Bio-Nano Vaccine\" Traditional vaccines invoke an imm une response and establish memory by introducing whole live or weakened pa thogens into the body. This effective method is inherently hazardous, especial ly for weakened or compromised immune systems. This research introduces only the disease-causing vector's signature on antigen-presenting devices. These template s are composed of pr otein-coated nano- sized particles. Particle size-controlle d syntheses allow investigation of the strongest immune recognition and res ponse induction. Surface proteins are strategically modified, whic h readily attach to surfaces . The vector's identifying tags are presented by binding in surface proteins. Verification and characterization of protein binding will include spectros copy and antibody assays. Non-cell to cell interactions of the antigen-presenting devices will be investigated for their ability to arm the body with the requisite imm une response memory. Effective bio-nano- vaccines can be dried, are not temperature dependent, and can be safely used as cocktails to compensate for particularly vi rulent viruses (HIV) that rapidly mutate their protein coats. 26 3. Kyle Belknap; Monica Elmashat; Sa ira Gardezi; Matthew nanosphere in esence of zeolite-like metal organic frameworks (ZMOFs)\" Metal nanospheres have been synthesized in the presence of porous, three- dimensional, zeolite-like metal organic frameworks (ZMOFS). These frameworks are based on the same topology as the co rresponding zeolites, but have larger cavities because they substitute the oxygen linkers of rho-ZMOF (the MOF presently in use, which can fit spheres of maximum diameter 18.2 \u00c5) with organic ones.1 Cadmium cations are left to exch ange into the anionic rho-ZMOF over a 24-hour period. Particle formation occurs with sodium sulfid e addition. UV-visible spectroscopy suggests that cadmium nanopart icles of appropriate size have been formed. Electron microscopy will be used to determine whether the particles have been formed outside or inside the ZMOF. Ideal conditions and ratios of cadmium, sulfide, and rho-ZMOF are being determin ed for nanoparticle formation within the MOF. Possible applications include but ar e not limited to technol ogies that require regularly patterned nanoparticles (such as smart surfaces, biosensors, storage, etc.) [1] Liu, Yunling, Victor C. Kravstov, Randy Larsen, and Mohamed Eddaoudi. \"Molecular Building Blocks Approach to the Assembly of Zeolite-Like Metal- Organic Frameworks (ZMOFs) with Extra-Large Cavities.\" Chemical Communications (2006).

Ryan Centko; Bill Baker \"Possible Biosynthetic Pathways for Isocyanides \" The isocyano functional group (R-NC) is ra re in nature and possibly important in cancer treatment research. However, the bios ynthesis of marine isocyanides is as of yet unknown to chemists and its occu rrence in several bi oactive secondary metabolites makes it an important and exciting functional group to study. The particular compounds that are of in terest in this study are 9- and 2- isocyanopupuakeanane. A sponge native to Hawaii in the genus Ciocalypta produces these compounds. The sponges were collected and using feeding experiments, chemical markers were adde d so that possible biosynthetic pathways of the sponge could be discovered. 275. Casey Cosner \"Selective Thiolate Labeling Agents\" Utilizing well-known chemical reactions, a ne w class of selective thiolate labeling agents have been synthesized. The reaction and class itself is general, allowing for a multitude of fluorescent/UV-active agents to be prepared on a large scale in good yields. The agents prepared react selectivel y with thiolate even in the presence of alcohols or amine containing 6. Frameworks (MOFs) repr esent an important class of solid crystalline materials. Within recent years, they have gained considerable attention for their applications in catalysis, magne tism, and gas storage. The design strategy of these frameworks focuses on a rati onal approach utiliz ing pre-designed molecular building blocks with metal ions and/or clusters linked by organic units. In this project a rigid, multifunctional carboxylate linker was chosen namely, 2,4,6-pyridine-tricarboxylic acid (H3PTC). Its reaction with Ni2+ has permitted the assembly of an extended network, 1.

Most AHB posses one or more Africanized Honey Bee Specific Prot eins (AHBSP) termed A1, A2, and B1. The purpose of this research is to create an ELISA based assay for identification o f these bees in the field. Sample proteins from bees in the Tampa area are screened by 2-D gel electrophoresis in order to de termine their degree of Africanization. The AHBSP are purified and tested using an assay developed at UT Austin by Dr. Verdel, in which monoclonal antibodies recognize the AHBSP from the Florida bees. Thus far, the research indicates 92% of the tested protein samples are AHBSP. Further research will contribute to the development of a dipstick assay fo r field identification of AHB in Florida. 288.

Zaworotko \"The Effect of Solvent and Impurity on the Solid State Synthesis of Polymorphic 2:3 Co-Crystals of Trimesic Ac id and 1,2-Bis(4-pyridyl)ethane\" Co-crystals are multiple-component crystals that consist of two or more molecules that are solids under ambient conditi ons and coexist through intermolecular interactions. Co-crystallization offers attractive opportunitie s to modify the chemical and/or physical properties of an active pharmaceutical ingredient without the need to make or break covalent bonds. Polymorphism is the existence of more than one crystalline form of a compo und. The discovery and selective production of a particular crystalline form is of great industrial relevance, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. The concomitant polymorphic co-crystals of trimesic aci d and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl) ethane exhibit two forms. Form I exhibits (10,3)-a networks that display an unprecedented 18-fold inte rpenetration whereas Form II exhibits hexagonal networks. The potenti al impact of solvents and impurities in the context of the solid state preparati on and polymorph selection in this system was studied via solvent drop grinding and the additi on of a 5% impurity that mimic the co- crystal former. The solvent drop grinding screen involved 16 different solvents that range in polarities. Infrared spec troscopy and powder X-ray diffraction were the primary characterization techniques employed. The result of this study will be presented herein. 9. Edward Gerges; Marian N. Farag; Miranda L. Cheney; Michael J. Zaworotko \"The Effects of Solvent and Impurity on the Solid State Preparation of Imides Utilizing Green Chemistry Techniques\" The emergence of green chemistry has lead to the development of many new synthetic techniques resulting in a redu ction of hazardous waste. Solvent-drop grinding has proven to be a novel approach in utilizing green chemistry for the generation of many co-crystals. By applyi ng this technique with a wide range of solvents of various polarities and in troducing an impurity, one can study their effects on co-crystal formation. Multiple solvents were employed to initiate the co-crystal formation while a 5% impurity was added to mimic one of the reactants. The impurity was chosen for its ability to potentially generate a co-crystal which, once formed, acts as a catalyst causing the remaining material to form a co-crystal. The mechanism for the condensation reacti on that occurs in solution between the primary amine and acid anhydride has been well studied. In the solid state, however, the mechanism is sti ll unclear. It is likely th at the condensation reaction occurs in the solid state due to the in termolecular interactions between the acid anhydride and primary amine moieties result ing in imide formation. The material was analyzed using Infrared Spectro scopy and X-ray Powder Diffraction. 2910. Glenn Harris; Anne Shearrow; Abdul Malik \" Investigative study on the use of Ioni c Liquids as solvents for sol-gel preparation\" A principal problem facing chemical pr ocessing involves th e replacement of modern environmentally damaging solvents for \"greener\" and safer solvents in chemical processes. Traditional solvents are harmful to the environment because they are commonly volatile and are used in high quantities. Ionic liquids are thermally stable and have low vapor pressures. These properties lower the environmental and detrimental impacts to human health. Substitution of conventional solvents with ionic liquids will provide a greener form of synthesis while still maintaining the integrity of the sol-gel system. Various ionic liquids were studied to synthesize novel hybrid organic-inorganic sol-gels. 11. Diondra Hill; M.

The aim of this study was to identify PKC isozymes and cell cycle markers in the breast cancer cell line, MD-468. Additionally, we wished to determine if PKCs are involved in the prol iferation of these breast cancer cells. Western blot analysis shows the presence of in th e MD-468 breast can cer cell line. In addition, immunoprecipitation of anti-C dk7 with rabbit polyclonal shows that PKC- is associated with Cdk7 in the MD-468 breast cancer cells. Inhibition of PKC- with small interfering RNA (SiRNA) decreased the proliferation of MD-468 cells; thereby suggest that PKC- is involved in regulating the prolif eration of these breast caner cells. 12.

Martin* Institute for Environmental Studies, Depart ment of Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620. Abstract Removal of heavy metals will allow e limination of toxic substances from environmental samples or will prevent their introduction into the environment. Silica gel will be used to form a co mplex with other compounds such as nitrilitriacetic acid (NTA), ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 2- mercaptoethanol by an acid catalyzed condensation. Compounds such as NTA were suspended with silica gel in tolu ene and refluxed using a condenser and a Dean-Stark tube. Water was removed by azeotropic distillation, and the progress of the reaction could be followed by noting the volume of water produced. Presumably, the NTA condensed by elimin ation of water between silica and the carboxyl group and a quadridenta te ligand was converted to a tridentate one (O, N, O coordination). The complex would be used to remove nickel (II) and other metal from standard solutions. Atomic spectromet er would be used to detect the removal of nickel (II) compounds. The complex is expected to remove most of the heavy metals from the solutions. Since, this will be a cheaper alternative to remove metals than the other compounds available in market; it could be used at large scale.

Studies indicate that oncogenic mutations induce a poptotic defects through the Bcl-2-dependent pathway.1 The Bcl-xL/Bak BH3 domain complex indicates an improved quality of inhibition and an inducti on of apoptosis. It is believed that the amphipathic terephthalamide scaffold, a sm all group of Bcl-xL inhibitors mimics the alpha-helical region of the Bak peptid e, thereby inhibiting the anti-apoptotic members of the complex. Recent experiments via multi-step synthetic reactions and verification of the product using NMR analyses have led to progress in the development of these highly amphipathic alpha-helical peptides based on the terephthalamide scaffold to use in anti-cancer studies. 1 Yin, Hang, et al. \"Terephthalamide Deriva tives as Mimetics of Helical Peptides: Disruption of Interaction.\" Journal of American Chemical Society 127 (2005): 5463-5468. Phoebe Zito; David (PAM) is a bi-functional copper and zinc dependent protein consisting of two separate catalytic components: peptidyl -hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) and -OH group) the -carbon and PAL cleaves the bond between the carbon and nitrog en releasing the free amide and glyoxylate. The substrates for PAM, in vivo, have th e general formula: R-CO-NH-CO2-COOH. The R-groups are either peptides or fatty acids yielding the -amidated peptide or fatty acid amide hormones with the gene ral formula: R-CO-NH2 and glyoxylates. In order to investigate whether PAM is capable of cleavi ng a sulfur-carbon bond, we tested thio-acetic acids (R-S-C H2-COOH) as PAM substrates. Oxygen consumption was detected with a number of thio-acetic acids indicating that the enzyme is able to hydroxylate thes e compounds. Presence of glyoxylate was confirmed through a glyoxylate assay i ndicating that the reaction proceeded beyond the hydroxylation and that the second step i.e. th e S-C cleavage occurred. Further studies will include full characteriz ation of the products of these reactions and the outcome of these studies may provide a better understanding of PAM chemistry to facilitate the rational design of anticancer PAM inhibitors. 35Graduate Posters (NES First Floor) 24.

In this work, atomi cally detailed simulations are used to describe the folding mechanisms of three Cold Shock protein mutants. For each protein, the Stochastic Difference Equation in Length (SDEL) was used to obtain multiple trajectories of 400 slices at room temperature. These trajectories are computed from the unfolded state to the native state as a boundary value problem with the integration step in the arc length. Thes e trajectories are analyzed and compared to study the effect of the mu tations on strand-stra nd interaction, turn formation, and collapse dynamics. Finally these results are compared against recent experimental evidence that suggests a two-state folding path with a rapid collapse. 3627. Richard Cross \"Synthesis of IBTZ6PA2: A Potential Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor with Improved Species Specificity\" In situ click chemistry is a novel target-g uided synthesis approach that aims at creating a shortcut in certain aspects of lead discovery applications. It relies solely on the protein target's ability to bind azide and acetylene reagents and hold them together in close proximity until they become connected via the arranged [1,3]- dipolar cycloaddition reaction yielding 1,2,3-tria zoles. The concept of in situ click chemistry was initially exploited using the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Incubation of AChE with libraries of azide s and acetylenes led to the formation of eight tacrine-derived 1,2,3-tr iazoles, which turned out to be highly potent AChE inhibitors with dissociation constants in the femto- and picomolar range. Although these eight inhibitors have been prov en to be the most potent noncovalent inhibitors of AChE to this date, they show a poor species specificity. Detailed binding studies revealed that these eight triazoles show similar inhibitory activity towards mouse, eel and dros ophila melanogaster AChE. Herein we discuss our attempts to design and synthesize a modified tacrine-derived triazole, namely IBTZ6PA2. We antic ipate that the affinity of IBTZ6PA2 towards drosophila melanogaster AChE to be significantly higher compared to mouse or eel AChE . 28.

Polymer films containing differing ratios of butyl acrylate to st yrene and were polymerized by emulsion polymerization and their physical and mechanical properties were analyzed, as well as their biocompatibility. Mechanical analysis determined that the films are a ne w form of smart materials that are able to return to ~50% of their nominal geometry after 1000% deformation under uni- axial tensile loads, and 100% of their original geometry after 700% displacement. It was concluded that different percen tages of co-monomers, surfactant and initiator result in polymer films with diffe rent strengths, yet a ll retain the same degree of memory. Biocompatibility of the films was establishe d in vitro against dermal fibroblast cells, which allows these smart films to be viewed as a promising new material for numerous biomedical applications. 3729.

This protein reversibly binds carbon monoxide resulting in a shift in the Soret band. The kine tic difference spectrum of the photolyzed minus unphotolyzed protein is significantl y red-shifted relative to the equilibrium deoxy minus CO-bound spectrum. The rate of CO recombination (1.3x105M-1s-1) is found for HemAT-Bs relative to hors e heart myoglobin (4.7x105M-1s-1). Using these rate constants along with the corresponding CO-di ssociation rate constants the equilibrium constants for CO bindi ng are found to be 1.4x106M-1 for HemAT- Bs which is similar to that of horse heart myoglobin (7.6x106M-1). Results of PhotoAcoustic calorimetry (PAC) studies demonstrate an increase in the molar volume (17mL.mol-1)and an enthalpy change (-33kcalmol-1) upon photolysis <50ns.

Divya Ramamoorthy \"Preparation of Small molecule inhibitors of BCl-XL-Bax\" Inhibiting the interaction of two proteins by a small organic molecule remains a challenging objective in chemical biol ogy. The BCl2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins confer a survival advantage to many cancer cells. The ability of a cell to undergo apopotosis can be restored by binding of the BCl2 peptides to BH3 pro- apoptotic binding partners. This anticancer response can be mimicked by small drug-like molecules that effectivel y act as BH3 peptide surrogates. We will describe the combinatorial synthesis of a small array of substituted isoquinolines that are potential inhibitors of the BCl-XL-Bax interaction. We will demonstrate that a versatile drug-like sca ffold can be prepared rapidly by adapting an old isoquinoline synthesis. We show th at microwave assisted synthesis is ideal for the rapid construction of this class of heterocycle.

These co mpounds do not function in the manner of the traditional beta-lactam antibiotics, but were thought to undergo an intracellular thiol-transfer to coenzyme A. Although CoA acts as the thiol-redox buffer in the genera most susceptible to the N-alkylth io-beta-lactams, studies on Coenzyme A disulfide reductase (CoADR) show that the redox buffer is not affected by these compounds. However, the recent finding that fatty acid synthesis is affected by the N-alkylthio beta-lactams led to the discovery that these compounds act as prodrugs, and that the asymmetric CoA di sulfides produced by intracellular thiol transfer are potent inhibitors of beta-Ketoacyl-acyl car rier protein synthase III (FabH) through a novel thiol-di sulfide exchange with the active site cysteine. 40 36.

It's been well documented that protein kinase C (PKC) pl ay a critical role in cell survival, differentiation, proliferation, and cell pol arity. However, the role of PKC-iota (PKC-i) in prostate cance r is largely unexplored. We hypothesized that PKC-i plays a critical role in cell proliferatio n and cell survival in prostate cancer cells. We found that in malignant cancer cells such as in the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP and a ndrogen independent prostate cancer cell line, DU145 there is an overexpression of PKC-i compare to normal prostate cells, RWPE-1. In normal prostate cells, RWPE- 1, PKC-i is associated with cyclin dependent kinase activating kinase (C AK/cdk-7). Cdk7 contributes to the cell cycle progression as part of the trimer ic CAK complex that phosphorylates and activates cdk-2/cyclin A to ensure the G1/S transition.
