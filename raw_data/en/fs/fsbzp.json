We are currently out of flu vaccine at this time. The [Student Health and Wellness Center](https://studentaffairs.unt.edu/student-health-and-wellness-center) provides free flu vaccinations to students. Flu vaccinations are free to students currently enrolled in classes and paying the student medical services fee. No appointment is necessary, but students do have to check in at the Student Health and Wellness Center on the second floor of Chestnut Hall to get vaccinated. Students who are not currently sick and are seeing a Student Health and Wellness Center provider can also request to get their flu vaccination while at the clinic for their appointment. Students who are sick should consult with their medical provider if they can get a flu vaccination or if they need to wait until they are better before getting vaccinated. UNT faculty and staff who are not enrolled in classes may get a flu vaccination for $22. Cash, check and credit cards are accepted for vaccinations given at the Student Health and Wellness Center. Flu Vaccination Clinics If you cannot make it to Chestnut Hall for your flu vaccination, we will also be holding several flu clinics around the main campus, Discovery Park, and at the New College at Frisco. Students, faculty, and staff can get vaccinated at the Flu Vaccinations Clinics. Faculty and staff will have to pay $20 for their flu vaccinations. Only cash and checks are accepted at the flu vaccination clinics. UNT faculty and staff who wish to pay with a credit card will have to visit the clinic in Chestnut Hall. Ways to Prevent Getting the Flu - Get your flu vaccination. [Studies](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/benefit-publications.htm)have shown that getting your annual flu vaccination can reduce your chances of being hospitalized from flu and possibly reduce the severity of the symptoms of the flu virus. Getting vaccinated also provides protection for others you might be in contact with such as infants, the elderly or others who might be at higher risk for having serious complications from flu infections. - Clean your hands. [Washing your hands](https://www.cdc.gov/cdctv/healthyliving/hygiene/fight-germs-wash-hands.html)often will help protect you from germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Hand sanitizer is available for students at the Meadows Center for Health Resources in Chestnut Hall 301. UNT departments can request hand sanitizer from the Office of Emergency Management & Safety Services by emailing [Robyn.Warren@unt.edu](mailto:Robyn.Warren@unt.edu)and specifying how many bottles you need for your department. - Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. Use a tissue, napkin, or other disposable items, if available, or cough/sneeze into your elbow to avoid spreading germs. If you do cough or sneeze into your hands, make sure to wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand cleaner. - Avoid sick people as much as possible. People infected with the flu may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 7 days after becoming sick. If you or a family member is sick, they should stay home until at least 24 hours after a fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities (such as groceries or medications). - Clean and disinfect services and objects that may be contaminated with germs like the flu. If you use your computer, phone or tablet while sick, make sure to check the manufacturer's website for recommended methods for disinfecting your device. Devices with screen protectors might also have additional options for cleaning agents that won't damage your device but refer to the screen protector manufacturer's website for recommendations.
