The goal is to understand the root cause of an ailment or illness rather than simply treat symptoms. This evolves from the belief that everything in the human body (both the physical body and spiritual one) is connected. In its ideal state, the human body will be in perfect balance. When an illness presents itself, this suggests the body is out of synch. Holistic medicine aims to restore balance, and usually in a way that's as natural as possible. \"Through my affiliation with Total Access Medical, I can finally focus on my work with my patients on their journey to health and wellness.\" \"At last, I can truly incorporate holistic principles and integrative care into my practice.

Holistic practitioners also place a heavy emphasis on preventive strategies in an effort to keep a body in balance.
