Porembka4, Jayanthi Lea5,A r t h u rE .F r a n k e l6, Yang-Xin Fu7, Zhijian J. Chen2,8*and Jinming Gao1* The generation of tumour-speci c T cells is critically important for cancer immunotherapy1,2. A major challenge in achieving a robust T-cell response is the spatiotemporal orchestration ofantigen cross-presentation in antigen-presenting cells withinnate stimulation. Here, we report a minimalist nanovaccine,comprising a simple physical mixture of an antigen and a syn- thetic polymeric nanoparticle, PC7A NP, which generates a strong T-cell response with low systemic cytokineexpression. Mechanistically, tumour antigens to antigen-presenting cells in draining lymph nodes, leading to increased surface presentation while simultaneously activating type I inter-feron-stimulated genes. This effect is dependent on stimulatorof interferon genes (STING), but not the Toll-like receptoror the mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) potent tumour growth inhi- in melanoma, colon cancer and human virus-E6/E7 tumour models. The combination of the PC7A nanovac-cine and an anti-PD-1 antibody showed great synergy, with100% survival over 60 days in a TC-1 tumour model. Rechallenging of these tumour-free animals with TC-1 cells led to complete inhibition of tumour growth, suggesting thegeneration of long-term antitumour memory. The STING-acti-vating nanovaccine offers a simple, safe and robust strategyin boosting anti-tumour immunity for cancer immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapy using nanoparticle vaccines (nanovac- cines) is an emerging area, with recent advances focusing on theco-delivery of antigens and adjuvants 3,4. Spatiotemporal control of antigen transport to the secondary lymphoid organs, cytosolic deliv- ery and cross-presentation in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in coordination with innate stimulation are essential to achieve arobust tumour-speci c T-cell response. Although nanoparticles (NPs, diameter) can selectively accumulate insidelymph nodes 4,5, few studies had shown their ability to simul- taneously promote antigen presentation and stimulate the innate immune response without the incorporation of adjuvants (forexample, CpG, poly(I:C)). Recently, our laboratory has developeda library of ultra-pH-sensitive (UPS) NPs (20 -50 nm in diameter) that are nely tunable over a broad range of physiological pH (4-7.4) 6. Once taken up by cells, these NPs can buffer the luminalpH of endocytic organelles at speci pH values7. 'proton sponge 'polymers for cytosolic delivery of biologics8and the small NP size for lymph node targeting, we performed an in vivo screening of UPS NPs to evaluate their abilities in generating acytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. The UPS library consistsof copolymers containing tertiary amines with linear or cyclic side chains (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Ovalbumin (OVA) was used as a model antigen. The OVA loading ef ciency was measured to be >75% for different polymer NPs (Supplementary Fig. 2). The OVA-speci c CTL response was quanti ed by an in vivo CTL assay (Fig. 1a). The results show that c splenocyte killings (82%) (Fig. 1b). PC7A or poly(ethylpropylamino)ethyl methacrylate(PEPA) NPs with (6.9 -7.0). In the linear amine series, PEPA had the highest CTL response. These data suggest that both the transition pH (pH 6.9, which targets earlyendosomal pH) and polymer architecture (the cyclic seven-mem-bered ring of PC7A) are important in inducing CTLresponse. Conventional PEG- b-poly( D,L-lactic response OVA-PC7A NPs induced an approximately 20 times OVA-alum the TLR4 pathway (3.7%) 10, and a 3.6 times higher response than OVA-CpG, which stimulates the TLR9 pathway (23%)11. OVA-speci c antibody responses from the sera of immu- nized mice showed that mice vaccinated with PC7A NPs generatedtitres of OVA-speci c IgG1 response comparable of alum or LPS (Fig. 1c). PC7A NPs also generated of OVA- specic IgG2c antibody to those immunized with OVA plus CpG or LPS (Fig. 1d). Altogether, we conclude that PC7A NPswere able to induce robust antigen-speci c CTL, Th1 and Th2 responses with comparable or better ef cacy than several established adjuvants. To image NP transport into draining lymph nodes (dLNs), we labelled PC7A copolymer with indocyanine green and quanti ed the PC7A NP (29 nm in diameter) biodistribution after subcu-taneous injection at the tail base. The results show ef cient accumu- lation of PC7A NPs in the peripheral lymph nodes at 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 3a).

To investigate the ability of PC7A NPs for antigen delivery, we rst veri ed that OVA can be encapsulated in PC7A NPs by a strong fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect, and the encapsulation was relatively stable in 5% serum over 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 2). We then used Alexa Fluor 647-labelled OVA with and without PC7A NP encapsulation and col-lected the dLNs 24 h after subcutaneous injection. Flow cytometryquanti ed the percentage of OVA-positive cells in CD8 +and cells (DCs) showed a signi cantly higher OVA accumulation by PC7A- mediated delivery over OVA alone (Fig. 2a). LN-resident CD8 +DC cells are known to be important the CTL response12. The the OVA-PC7A NP group compared with OVA-only control. We then investigated the effect of PC7A NPs on cytosolic delivery cells a similar amount of antigen uptake as OVA-PD5A NPsand less than the OVA-only group (Fig. 2c). In contrast, the OVA peptide (SIINFEKL) -MHC-I complex demonstrated a threefold increase in antigen cross-presentation by PC7A NPs over the two control groups (Fig. 2d). Using an in vitro OT-I of CD8+T cells isolated from OT-I mice compared with the other control groups (Fig. 2e).This result was further supported by an in vivo c CD8+ T cells showed 15-fold higher proliferation in the OVA-PC7A NPs than in the OVA-only group (Fig. 2f,g). Endosomal disruption forcytosolic delivery was rst indicated by a haemolysis assay in red blood cells (RBCs) at different pH values 14. The results showed that PC7A NPs had no haemolytic effect at pH 7.4, but induced strong haemolysis ( 90%) at pH values below 7.0 upon micelle dis- sociation. PD5A NPs did not show any observable RBC haemolysisin the same pH range (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b).

Co-stimulatory signals (for example, CD80/86) and cytokines are also necessary to induce a strong tumour-speci c CTL response16. At 24 h post-immunization with OVA-PC7A NPs, inguinal LNs increased in size compared to OV A alone (Supplementary Fig. 3b).The total cell number in the inguinal LNs from OVA-PC7ANP-treated mice increased more than two times compared withcontrols (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Flow cytometry analysis showed signicantly higher expressions of CD86 in different subgroupsof APCs from mice treated with OV A-PC7A NPs over three other control groups (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3d). Type I IFNshave been shown to boost the effectiveness of the CD8 +T cell response17,18. We examined the expressions of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in local tissues19over time after subcutaneous injection of PC7A NPs. Poly(I:C) was used as a positive control20. Poly(I:C) was able to elicit a higher response in the expression of IRF7and CXCL10 from 2 to 8 h than PC7A NPs.

All rights reserved.To validate the effect of the type I IFN pathway on the CTL response, we measured the OV A-speci c CTL and Th1 response in IFN receptor ( IFN-/R/) knockout mice. The data show that the majority of the CTL/Th1 response was abolished in IFN-/R/ mice compared to wild-type control (Fig. 3d -f), consis tent with the ISG expression data. Toll-like receptors (TLR), MAVS and STINGare known to activate the type I interferon pathways 17,21.T h e immune response in MyD88//TRIF/,MAVS/orSTINGgt/gt mice showed that the T-cell response was not dependent on TLR or MAVS, whereas STINGgt/gtmice almost recapitulated which subsequently activates STING, leading to the induc- tion of type I IFNs 22. Additional studies in cGAS/mice showed that the CTL response was partially dependent on cGAS. The roles ofSTING and cGAS in ISG induction were further con rmed by in vitro cell culture data using bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and human monocyte THP-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). To evaluate the role of cytosolic DNA in cGAS-dependent STINGactivation, we transfected PC7A-induced ISG level in wild-type BMDMs decreased to almost the same level as in cGAS/BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 5c). For cGAS-independent STING activation, we performed STING pulldown assay using biotin-conjugatedPC7A NPs show thatonly PC7A -biotin was able to retain STING, but not PD5A - biotin and PC7A-only (biotin free) controls (Supplementary of the puri ed C-terminal domain(CTD, 139 -397 AAs) of STING (Supplementary Fig. 5e) suggests direct binding between STING and PC7A. Isothermal calorimetryanalysis showed a dissociation constant ( K d) of 1.3 \u00b5M (Supplementary Fig. 5f,g). This interaction is weaker than cGAMP binding to STING ( Kd= 9.6 nM). Negligible binding was found between PC7A and bovine serum albumin in the negative control.Despite such evidence of a speci c interaction between PC7A and STING, further structural and functional studies are required to determine if PC7A can activate STING through direct binding. To identify which cell populations are responsible for NP uptake and STING activation, Cy5-labelled PC7A polymer was used toquantify NP uptake, and phosphorylated IRF3 (pIRF3) was usedto detect the activation of the STING-type I IFN pathway 24. Flow cytometry analysis showed that in LNs 24 h post-injection, NP+ cells had signi cantly elevated pIRF3 (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Furthermore, 87% of NP+cells expressed a DC cell marker (CD11c+), as corroborated by MHC-II+expression (Supplementary Fig. 6b). The same analysis was performed on cell suspensions from the injection site (Supplementary Fig. 6c). Thedata show that CD45+leukocytes internalized a signi cantly of PC7A NPs than CD45cells. In the CD45 cells, we did not observe any signi cant increase in the pIRF3 levels. In the CD45+cells, signi cantly elevated pIRF3 levels were found in the NP+c e l l so v e rN Pcells. About 95% of CD45+NP+cells showed CD11c+expression (lower panel in Supplementary Fig. 6d).

We compared the IDO-1 and CXCL10 expression proles treated with the whole panel of NPs. The results show that the lack of CTL activity by NPs other than PC7A NP is not a result of elevated IDO-1 expression, but rather is due to the lack ofSTING activation (Supplementary Fig. 5i,j). IDO enzyme activity in mice treated with subcutaneous injections of selected polymers(PC7A, PD5A or PEPA NP, 150 \u00b5g, ve times the vaccine dose) showed no statistical signi cance (Supplementary Fig. 5h). The elevated IDO expression by PC7A NPs may warrant future studies of the potential immune checkpoint effect following T-cell activation.05 10 15 20 25Tumour size (mm3)f 05001,0001,5002,000TC-1 Days after tumour inoculation***g 01 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 Days after tumour inoculationNC Peptide alone Peptide-PC7A NP ***05 10 15 20 20 30 40 10 0 2505001,0001,5002,0002,500B16-OVA Days after tumour lysisMinimalist nanovaccine STING Cross-presentation LN antigen delivery 114 NPeptide Figure 4 | PC7A nanovaccine inhibits tumour growth and prolongs survival in tumour-bearing mice. a, Schematic of the minimalist of the PC7A nanovaccine. b,c, C57BL/6 mice were ( and Kaplan -Meier survival curves ( c) of tumour-bearing mice are shown. d, Tumour study of melanoma.

Different nanovaccine groups were subcutaneously injected 5 days after tumour inoculation, followed by a booster shot5 days later (Fig. 4b). In the PBS control group, all the animals diedwithin 20 days. OVA 257 -280alone, PC7A NP alone or OVA 257 -280- PD5A NP groups did not offer any signi cant tumour growth inhi- bition or survival bene t over the PBS control (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). OVA 257 -280-CpG and OV A 257 -280-poly(I:C) groups con- ferred a minor degree immune protection (Fig. 4b,c). In contrast,OVA 257 -280-PC7A NPs achieved the maximum therapeutic ef cacy, with 50% of animals surviving over 40 days. In B16-F10 melanoma, we used a cocktail signi cantly slowed the growth of B16-F10 tumours over antigen only, PC7A only and non- treated controls (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 7c). In the coloncancer improved tumour growth inhibition (Fig. of mice were tumour- free days after treatment with E7 43-62-PC7A NPs (Fig. 4f,g and Supplementary Fig. 8e). The combination of PC7A nanovaccinewith an anti-PD-1 antibody showed synergy in both B16-OVA melanoma and TC-1 tumour models (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 8). In the TC-1 model, 100% of the animals survived for over60 days and 90% were tumour-free (SupplementaryFig. models showed PD-L1 expression on tumour cells, while a certain subtype of myeloid cells had high PD-L1 expressions over the isotype control(Supplementary Fig. 8d,f). These data support nanovaccinesynergy with anti-PD1 therapy. Meanwhile, anti-PD-1 therapyalone did not lead to a signi cantly improved antitumour effect in either model, similar to the results of other reports 30,31. Tumour- free mice were rechallenged with 1 \u00d7 106TC-1 tumour cells 82 days after tumour inoculation. The data show that previously treated,tumour-free mice were resistant to the newly inoculated tumourcells, whereas such tumours grew robustly in naive mice and surgi- cally cured mice (Supplementary Fig. 7e). These results suggest a long-term antitumour response induced by the nanovaccine,which probably activates memory T cells. Analyses of the systemiccytokines/chemokines of mice treated with PC7A NPs (150 \u00b5g, ve- fold of vaccine dose) showed much lower systemic cytokine levels than with poly(I:C) control (Supplementary Fig. 9). Furthermore, histology analysis of the major organs (for example, liver, spleen,kidney and heart) did not show any observable toxicity in micetreated with repeated injections of PC7A nanovaccine (150 \u00b5g, ve times the vaccine dose, Supplementary Fig. 10). These data demonstrate the safe and ef cacious antitumour immunity from PC7A nanovaccine at a small antigen dose (0.5 g) and its notable synergy with a checkpoint inhibitor. In summary, we have discovered a synthetic NP that not only enhances antigen delivery and cross-presentation, but also stimu- lates the STING pathway to boost antitumour immunity forcancer immunotherapy. The simplicity, robust T cell activationand synergy with checkpoint inhibition make the PC7A nanovac-cine an attractive candidate for clinical development. This nanovac- cine platform can be rapidly adopted to incorporate many existing tumour-associated antigens as well as a growing number oftumour neoantigens 32,33. The unique characteristics of the PC7A NPs also allow them to package microbial antigens as vaccines forthe prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.Methods Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper .

All Materials. Monomers 2-(diethylamino)ethyl CpG oligodeoxynucleotides were from Invivogen, Imject alum was purchased from Thermo Scienti c, and LPS and poly(I:C) were by Biomatik. PEG-PLA was purchased from Advanced Polymer Materials. Other solvents and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher following a previously published procedure35. The following are the chemical characterizations (ATRP) following previously reported procedures36. PEG- b-PDPA is used as an example to illustrate the procedure. First, DPA-MA (7 mmol), PMDETA (0.1 mmol) and MeO-PEG 114-Br were dissolved in 2-propanol (2 ml) and DMF (2 ml). After three cycles of freeze -pump -thaw, CuBr (0.1 mmol) was added. The polymerization was carried out at 40 \u00b0C for 10 h. The reaction mixture was passed through a neutral Al 2O3 column, and the residue was dialysed in distilled water and lyophilized. The obtained polymers copolymers for the conjugation of dyes similar procedure34,35. After synthesis, PEG- b-(PR- r-AMA) (10 mg) and dye-NHS (1.5 equiv.) were both dissolved in DMF. After overnight reaction, the copolymers were puri ed by preparative GPC. Preparation of NPs. Micelles were prepared following a solvent evaporation method35. In the example of PEG- b-PC7A, copolymer was dissolved in methanol and then added into distilled water under sonication. Methanol was removed using an ultra ltration tube ( Mw= 100 kDa). The NPs dynamic scattering (DLS, Malvern MicroV, He-Ne laser, = 632 nm) to determined the hydrodynamic diameter ( Dh). OVA loading and stability studies. OV A loading ef ciency inside the NPs was measured by an ultra ltration method. Brie fly, NPs (300 \u00b5g ml-1) were mixed with AF647-labelled OVA (100 \u00b5g ml-1) for 30 min. Free OVA was removed by ultraltration tube with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 kDa. The concentration of free OVA was measured on a Hitachi fluorometer (F-7500 model) with an excitation wavelength at 640 nm. The loading ef ciency was calculated according to Loading efficiency =Total OVA Free OVA Total OVA\u00d7 100%To evaluate the loading stability, OVA-loaded PC7A NPs were incubated in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5% fetal bovine serum over different periods. Free OVA was separated and determined as described above. A FRET experiment was carried out to investigate the interactions of polymer and OVA. Typically, Cy3.5-conjugated PC7A (100 \u00b5g ml-1) was incubated with AF647-labelled OVA (20 \u00b5g ml-1) in PBS buffer (pH 7.4). After 30 min incubation, fluorescence emission spectra were measured on a Hitachi fluorometer (F-7500 model). The samples were excited at 590 nm and the emission spectra were collected from 600 to 750 nm. Animals and cells. All animal procedures were performed with ethical compliance and approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Female C57BL/6 mice (6 -8 weeks) were obtained from the UT Southwestern breeding core. INF-/R/mice were provided were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. MyD88//TRIF/mice were crossed in our laboratory. cGas/mice were generated as previously described37. All strains were maintained on a C57BL/6J background. For each experiment, mice were randomly allocated by blinded investigators to each group. STIN Ggt/gtandcGAS/BMDMs were derived from corresponding knockout mice and then cultured in M-CSF-containing medium for 6 -7 days. THP-1 cells were purchased from ATCC, and we established THP-1 cell lines stably expressing shRNA targeting hSTING and hcGAS, as described previously38. B16-OVA cells were provided by P. Hwu at MD Anderson Cancer Center, TC-1 cells were provided by T. C. Wu at John Hopkins University, and MC38 cells were purchased from ATCC. All cell lines were routinely tested using a mycoplasma contamination kit (R&D). Cells were cultured in complete medium (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum,100 U ml-1penicillin G sodium and 100 \u00b5g ml-1streptomycin (Pen/Strep), MEM non-essential acids (all -mercaptoethanol (-ME)) at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2and the normal level of O 2. In vivo cytotoxicity killing assay. Groups of C57BL/6 mice were injected (10 \u00b5g OV A plus 30 \u00b5g NPs or other adjuvants with the same dose) subcutaneously at the tail base of C57BL/6 mice. Imject alum (4 mg per mouse, 50 \u00b5l:50 \u00b5l mixture with the antigen solution) was used by volume ratio, as recommended by the manufacturer. One week later, naive C57BL/6 mice were killed, and splenocytes were collected. Half of the splenocytes were pulsed with OVA 257 -263or E7 49-57peptides for 2 h in complete medium at 37 \u00b0C. The unpulsed and peptide-pulsed cells were labelled carboxy fluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), respectively, in serum-free medium 15 min. Equal numbers (1 \u00d7 107) of CFSElow (OVA pulsed) and CFSEhigh(unpulsed) cells were mixed together and injected intravenously into the immunized mice. After 16 h, blood from treated mice was collected and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. The numbers of CFSEhighand CFSElowcells were determined and used to calculate the percentage of OVA peptide-pulsed target cell killing. Speci c killing was de ned as Percentage of specific lysis =[1non-transferred control ratio/ experimental ratio] \u00d7 100 ELISA assay. For antibody detection, groups of C57BL/6 mice were immunized with different vaccines on days 0 and 14. On day 21, 50 \u00b5l blood was drawn from the tail vein, and levels of antigen-speci c IgG1 and IgG2c in the serum were measured by ELISA. For ELISA assay, flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Nunc) were precoated with OV A protein at a concentration of 0.5 \u00b5g protein per well in 50 mM carbonate buffer(pH 9.6) at 4 \u00b0C overnight, which were then blocked with 5% glycine. Antisera obtained from immunized 102to 106in PBS-0.05% Tween (PBS-T), pH 7.4, and were added to the wells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 BSA for labelling. After adding the HRP substrates, optical densities were determined at a wavelength of 450 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad). Lymph node imaging assay. To investigate whether NPs can accumulate in the draining lymph nodes, we labelled the PC7A injected subcutaneously into the tail base of C57BL/6 mice. NP distribution was imaged using a clinical camera (SPY Elite). Animals were killed at 24 h afterinjection of NPs, and major organs and inguinal and axillary LNs were excised and imaged. In vivo cell uptake assay. For antigen delivery assay, subcutaneous injections at the tail base of C57BL/6 mice were performed with PBS alone, OVA-AF647, or NP plus OV A-AF647 treatments. At 24 h post injection, mice were killed and inguinal lymph nodes were removed, teased with 26 gauge needles and then passed through a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer (BD) to recover a cell suspension. The lymph node cell suspension was stained with propidium iodide (PI) and anti-CD11c-FITC, anti-CD11b-paci c Publishers of Springer Nature. All rights reserved.DC cells (CD11c+CD11bB220CD8+), CD8 DC cells (CD11c+CD8), macrophage cells were analysed for the OV A-AF647 positive cells. APC maturation was measured by staining with anti-CD86-PE. For NP uptake and STING activation assay, subcutaneous injections at the tail base of C57BL/6 mice were carried out with PBS alone or PC7A-Cy5 (30 g) treatments. At 24 h post injection, mice were killed, and inguinal lymph nodes and subcutaneous tissue were removed and digested in collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 25 min at 37 \u00b0C. Tissue was then passed through a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer (BD) to recover a cell suspension. All the cell suspensions were stained with PI and anti-CD11c-FITC, anti-MHCII-BV605 and anti-CD45.2-Apc-Cy7. For intracellular a xation/permeabilization kit (BD cat. no. 554714). After blocking with mouse serum, cells were stained with pIRF3 antibody (Cell Signaling, cat. no. 4947) and subsequently stained with anti-rabbit IgG-PE secondary antibody (Biolegend). Flow cytometry (LSRII, BD) was performed on stained cell suspensions and analysed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). In vitro cell uptake and cross-presentation assay. BMDCs were generated by culturing bone marrow cells flushed from the femurs of C57BL/6J mice in DC medium: DMEM ng ml-1GM-CSF. The medium was half replaced every 2 days. Non-adherent and loosely adherent immature DCs were collected on day 6 and phenotyped by determining the expression of CD11c (routinely 60 -80% CD11c+). OVA-AF647 (2 \u00b5g ml-) \u00b5g ml-1)w a s incubated with murine BMDCs at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h and quanti ed using the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cells by flow cytometry analysis. For the cross- presentation assay, BMDCs were incubated with OVA alone or a mixture of OVA and different NPs at 37 \u00b0C for 18 -20 h, then the OVA 257 -267presented on the MHC- I on the cell surface was detected by monoclonal antibody 25 mAb-D1.16, an antibody that speci cally recognizes OVA peptide to H-2Kb. In vitro CD8+T cell BMDCs, IFN- secretion by primed OT-I T to quantify CD8+T-cell activation. Brie fly, BMDCs were incubated with 3 \u00b5g ml-1OVA alone or a mixture of OVA with different NPs (50 \u00b5g ml-1) at 37 \u00b0C for 18 h. CD8+T lymphocytes from OT-I mice were selected by magnetic separation (MACS system; Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer 's instructions. The purity of CD8+ T lymphocytes was >95%. CD8+T cells were plated at 2 \u00d7 105cells per well in 96-well plates (Costar, Corning) in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS and 2 \u00d7 105 unpulsed or antigen-pulsed BMDCs, which were added for 24 h. Cell culturesupernatants were collected and analysed for cytokine content using a mouseTH1/TH2 9-Plex Ultra-sensitive Kit (Meso Scale Discovery). Samples were In vivo CD45.2+OT-I mice, and CD8+T cells from cell suspensions were isolated by magnetic bead separation on a MACS column. A total of 5 \u00d7 104OT-1 CD8+T cells were transferred into B6 CD45.1+mice via intravenous injection and allowed to acclimate for 1 day before immunization. After 1 day, groups of CD45.1+mice were immunized subcutaneously with PBS alone, OVA(10 \u00b5g) or NP (30 \u00b5g) plus OVA at the tail base. One week later, spleens were collected and dispersed into single-cell suspensions, stained with anti-CD8-PE-cy7, APC-conjugated H-2Kb/OV assay. The capacity of polymers to promote pH-dependent disruption of lipid bilayer membranes was assessed by a RBC haemolysis assay as previously described14. Polymers were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of mouse erythrocytes at 20 \u00b5g ml-1in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (supplemented with 150 mM NaCl) in the pH range of the endosomal processing pathway (7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.8, 6.6 and 6.4). The extent of cell lysis (that is, haemolytic activity) was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the amount of haemoglobin released (A541 nm). Haemolytic activity was normalized to 100% lysis control Triton X-100 treated RBCs). Samples were run in triplicate. Flow cytometry. Antibodies were purchased from Biolegend. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-CD16/CD32 (Biolegend, on a II flow cytometer and analysed using FlowJo software.Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Subcutaneous tissues were taken at indicated time points after injection with OVA- PC7A NPs (10 \u00b5g OVA, 150 \u00b5g PC7A) or dose of different adjuvants. To obtain BMDMs, 1\u00d71 07bone marrow cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, antibiotics and conditioned medium from L929 cell culture. After 6 to 7 days, mature macrophages were collected and cultured on 12-well plates for experiments5. Total RNAs were extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen) from cells or tissues, according to the manufacturer 's instructions. qRT -PCR was performed as previously described37,38. Samples were run in triplicate. The following (Roche) by transfection reagent DOTAP (Roche) according to the manufacturer 's instructions. After incubating the cells with DOTAP-DNase I or DOTAP alone for 1 h, cells were washed to remove excess transfection reagent and enzyme and were then incubated with PC7A at 400 \u00b5g ml-1for 9 h. CXCL10 was measured by RT -PCR. STING pulldown assay. To investigate the STING interaction with PC7A copolymer, we labelled the PC7A copolymer with biotin (2 with THP-1 cells for 8 h, then cells were collected and lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma R0278). Lysates were (BD were analysed using SDS -PAGE and western blots by rabbit anti- STING antibody (Cell Signaling, cat. no. 13647). For STING protein pulldown assay, human STING CTD (139 expression with STING CTD (1 \u00b5g ml-1) for 3 h in PBS (pH 6.8), and PEPA -biotin in PBS (pH 6.8) and PD5A -biotin in PBS (pH 4.4) with the same concentration were used as control groups and then precipitated with streptavidin-modi ed Dynabeads. Samples were analysed using SDS -PAGE and western blots. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). ITC was used to measure the binding afnities between STING CTD and PC7A polymers or cGAMP using VP-ITC microcalorimeter (GE Healthcare), and ITC of PC7A -BSA was used as negative control. Titrations were performed at 20 \u00b5C in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 6.8) and 150 mM NaCl. Thirty-two injections were performed with 4 min spacing time. The titration traces were integrated by NITPIC, and the curves were tted by SEDFIT39. Clontech) was prepared using an endotoxin-free kit (Qiagen). Mice were intravenously injected with mixed with in vivo -jetPEI (Polyplus-transfection, N:P = 8) or were injected s.c. with NPs (150 \u00b5g, ve times the vaccine dose). IDO activity was measured as described in previous reports40,41. Enzyme activity was expressed as the product content per hour per gram of tissue protein. Immunization and tumour therapy experiments. Six- to eight-week-old mice (n= 10 for each group) were injected subcutaneously with B16-OVA or B16F10 melanoma cells (1.5 \u00d7 105), cells (1.5 \u00d7 105) or MC38 cells (5 \u00d7 105) into the right flank of mice. Animals were immunized by subcutaneous injection into the tail base of antigen -polymer NPs (0.5 \u00b5g per antigen peptide, PC7A NP 30 \u00b5g) or the same dose of different adjuvants as described in the main text. Alternatively, at days 3, 6, 9 and 12, some groups were intraperitoneally injected with 200 \u00b5g checkpoint inhibitors (anti-mPD-1, BioXcell, BE0 146) for comparison or synergy evaluation. Tumour growth was subsequently measured twice a week using a digital caliper and calculated as 0.5 \u00d7 length \u00d7 width2by blinded investigators. Mice were killed when the tumour volumes reached 1,500 mm3(the end point of tumour detection is two times the longest survival time (LST) of the control group, so about 40 days for the melanoma tumour model and about 60 days for TC-1 and MC38 tumour models). For PD-L1 expression analyses, tumour tissues were digested by 1 mg ml-1 collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2 mg ml-1DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were then stained with antibodies against PD-L1, CD11b,Gr-1, F4/80, CD11c and CD45 (Biolegend). Statistical analysis. Based on pilot immunization and tumour treatment studies, we used group sizes of three to six animals per group for immunogenicity measurements and ten animals per group for tumour therapy experiments.
