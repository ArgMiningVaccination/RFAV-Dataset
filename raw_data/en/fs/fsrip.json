Description Have you ever wanted a multivitamin that was perfect for your whole family and you didn't have to buy vitamins for kids, adults, men, and women? Let us introduce you to Nourish Me Naturally - the multivitamin that is safe for the entire family! Nourish Me Naturally is formulated with herbs that are rich in vitamins and minerals that everyone needs. Boys, girls, women, and men alike are able to take Nourish Me Naturally and get the daily nutrients they need to sustain them through the entire day. If you have a large family and don't want to buy vitamins for each person, look no further! Our bodies need extra support. Our food is nutritionally deficient leaving us with gaps in our own nutrition. Nourish Me Naturally serves to bridge that gap and provide you with the nutrients you need to go throughout your day and help growing bodies grow big and strong. Most \"multivitamins\" are purified, extracted, and synthetic (often with additives). They also have megadoses of vitamins and minerals that cannot be adequately absorbed by the body, which throws off nutrient balance. Nourish Me Naturally is different because it is made simply with whole herbs extracted in sustainable, vegetable glycerin. This herbal multivitamin provides nutrients in the proper amounts that your body can actually absorb. Nourish Me Naturally is a must have for every family!

A: Kids can take Nourish Me Naturally beginning at 1 year of age. Q: Can I mix this with juice or a smoothie? A: Nourish Me Naturally can be taken straight orally or mixed with water, juice, smoothies, etc. Adding to juice or smoothies does not harm its effectiveness. Q: How does an herbal multivitamin work? A: Conventional vitamins in pill form are full of binders and fillers to make them keep their shape and hold all of the ingredients together. Liquid herbal vitamins are made without binders and fillers making them easier to digest. Plus, the vitamins you get are from real food sources and not synthetic making them more biologically friendly to your body! Q: The amount of vitamins in the tinctures are low, especially compared to what you buy in the store. Why? A: Because these are whole food sources. Being natural and real food sourced, the amount of each vitamin will be lower. But being natural and real food sourced, it'll be recognized by your body so that most of it is used. Compared to synthetic options, where your body doesn't know how to and ( just can't ) use it all. "}
