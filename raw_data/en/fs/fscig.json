Printed in Austria PRINTED ON CHLORINE-FREE BLEACHED PAPER (ECF)EU Agencies working for youEU AGENCIES 4WORKING FOR YOU5INTRODUCTION A single market, a single currency, borderless travel, internal mobility - just some of the very tangible benefits of the EU that many of us cannot imagine life without today. The network of specialist EU agencies set up by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to carry out specific legal, technical or scientific tasks is an important component of the EU. They work alongside the main EU institutions and Member States, feeding them evidence-based advice to help shape informed policies and laws at the EU and national level. They add value by promoting the sharing of information and expertise in areas that impact the lives of Europe's 500 million citizens. And all this for only 0.6% of the EU's total annual budget - only \u20ac1.6 for every man, woman and child in the EU. Around the world, respected and well-known agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration in the US, have been created to give expert advice to their national administrations. EU agencies were similarly created to help implement EU policies more efficiently and to respond to particular needs identified by the EU institutions and Member States. They work on a wide range of areas that touch the lives of everyone across the EU (and beyond) on land, at sea, in the air, in sickness and in health. They cover the food we eat, the medicine we take, chemicals, education, quality of working life, the environment, not to mention justice, safety of transport, security and our fundamental rights. This list is not exhaustive, but serves to give you a flavour of some of the many specialist areas they work on. This brochure provides an overview of the breadth and depth of work carried out by the various specialist EU agencies. It clearly underlines their combined added-value, and how they are working to help make Europe more competitive and a better place to live and work.EU AGENCIES 6WORKING FOR YOU7Table of Contents Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions - (Eurofound) Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Union Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders - (Frontex) . . 25 European Union Institute Harmonization in the Internal Market - Trade Marks and of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications - (BEREC Centre for the Bodies of the European Union - the Cooperation of Energy Regulators - ACER ACER works towards completing a competitive, sustainable, secure and transparent internal energy market for the benefit of all EU consumers. Its mission is to assist national energy regulatory authorities to perform their duties at EU level and to coordinate their actions whenever necessary. It cooperates with EU institutions and stakeholders, notably national authorities and European Networks of Transmission System Operators, to deliver instruments for the completion of the single EU energy market. ACER supports the development of a common energy market and network rules. It also contributes to the development of a trans-European energy infrastructure, and monitors EU energy markets and wholesale energy trading. On top of setting a framework for common rules in Europe's energy markets, ACER highlights issues affecting the everyday lives of EU citizens. For example, in gas and electricity retail markets, ACER has identified persistent barriers in many national markets, which hamper retail competition and consumer choice. This includes low supplier switching rates of around 5% for electricity and gas. In addition, despite the economic downturn, consumer prices for electricity and gas, which are still often regulated, have risen in most Member States in the last few years by 4%. Established in 2011Located in Ljubljana, Sloveniawww.acer.europa.euClean Sky Joint Undertaking - Clean Sky Clean Sky aims to drastically reduce the environmental impact of aviation by developing cutting-edge technologies by 2020. This includes: halving external noise and CO2 emissions by significantly cutting fuel consumption; an 80% reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions; and ensuring a green product life-cycle from design and manufacturing to maintenance and disposal/recycling. Clean Sky is a public-private partnership between the European Commission and Europe's aeronautics industry. It brings together aeronautical leaders, SMEs, universities and research organisations to develop and deliver the aircraft technologies of the future. Close to 40% of the beneficiaries of Clean Sky funding in October 2013 were European SMEs, thereby contributing to growth and jobs in the European research and innovation sector. Clean Sky has been an unambiguous success story and has led to the launch of the more ambitious Clean Sky 2 Programme with a total budget of nearly \u20ac4 billion. It aims to achieve a higher level of technology integration and to raise the maturity of systems incorporating these new technologies. It will be the largest and most ambitious aeronautical research and development programme ever launched in Europe, a clear demonstration of Clean Sky's added value. Established in 2008Located in Brussels, Belgiumwww.cleansky.eu WORKING FOR YOU9 Community Plant Variety Office - CPVO The CPVO fosters innovation in the creation of plant varieties by its high quality processing of applications for EU plant variety rights at affordable costs. It manages the EU's plant variety rights system. It provides intellectual property rights for breeders of new plant varieties for 25-30 years. It also provides policy guidance and assistance in the exercise of these rights for its stakeholders. The EU plant variety rights system is the biggest of its kind in the world, with over 50,000 applications processed since 1995. Over 39,000 Community plant variety rights have been granted. In addition, the CPVO is self-financing with no EU funding, as applicants pay for all agency running costs. Previously, breeders had to submit applications in the relevant language to each EU Member State and pay fees in each country. Thanks to the CPVO, one application in any official EU language gives an intellectual property right valid throughout the 28 Member States. The simplified administrative process and lower overall fees has proven to be very attractive for breeders. The exclusive right enables breeders to collect royalties to reinvest in creating new varieties which benefits growers and the public alike. Established in 1995Located in Angers, Francewww.cpvo.europa.eu European Agency for Safety and Health at Work - EU-OSHA EU-OSHA's mission is to help make Europe's workplaces safer, healthier and more productive. Every year more than 4,000 workers die due to accidents at work and more than three million workers are victims of a serious accident at work. Meanwhile, 25% of workers declare that work has a mainly negative effect on their health. The costs to workers, businesses and EU Member States are estimated at around 3 % of GDP . More than ever, occupational safety and health (OSH) is an important and challenging policy area. As new risks and areas of work emerge, demographics change and Europe responds to the economic crisis, the need for good OSH \u2014 which protects workers and makes businesses more profitable \u2014 is urgent and growing. Working with governments, employee representatives and businesses small and large, EU-OSHA takes a joined-up approach to promoting OSH across Europe. Through its Foresight activities it anticipates change and new and emerging risks. Instruments such as its ESENER enterprise survey provide an accurate and comprehensive picture of current OSH risks. At the same time the agency is developing tools for good OSH management, such as OiRA (Online interactive Risk Assessment). Meanwhile, EU-OSHA's Healthy Workplaces awareness-raising campaigns are now the largest of their kind in the world. And its OSHwiki online encyclopaedia offers a new approach to networking knowledge. Established in 1994Located in Bilbao, Spainwww.osha.europa.eu EU AGENCIES10 European Aviation Safety Agency - EASA Air transport is one of the safest forms of travel. As air traffic continues to grow, common Europe-wide efforts are needed to keep air transport safe and sustainable. EASA develops such common safety and environmental rules. It monitors the implementation of standards through inspections in Member States. It also provides technical expertise and training to the aviation system. The agency works hand-in-hand with national aviation authorities, which each have their own role to play in EU aviation. Through EASA, Europe centralises the process of authorising non-EU airlines performing commercial air transport operations into the EU's airspace. This means a single safety authorisation is issued centrally by EASA, replacing the various schemes that EASA Member States have used up to now. EASA only assesses the safety of foreign airlines. Operating permits will continue to be issued by national authorities. It contribution to EU aviation safety can be seen the low level of fatalities: Since 2007 there has not been a year with over one fatal accident involving an aeroplane operated by an EASA Member State. Established in 2002Located in Cologne, Germanywww.easa.europa.eu European Asylum Support Office - EASO EASO contributes to the coherent implementation of the EU's common European asylum system. It facilitates, coordinates and strengthens practical cooperation among Member States on asylum issues. It offers practical, technical and operational support including evidence-based input for EU policy making and legislation. EASO is a centre of expertise on asylum. EASO helps improve the quality of the asylum process through harmonised training and information on countries from where asylum seekers originate. Such information is essential for officials during the asylum determination process. In 2013, it trained over 2,100 asylum officials. It also provides tailor-made assistance, supports capacity building and relocation, and develops quality control tools. It offers emergency support for Member States subject to particular pressures by providing temporary support and assistance to repair or rebuild asylum and reception systems. For example, Greece, Luxembourg, Sweden, Italy, Bulgaria and Cyprus received EASO's operational support. It shares information and data, analyses and assessments at EU level. For example, EASO's early warning and preparedness system regularly provides a regional outlook and analysis of asylum trends and push-pull factors, as well as risk scenarios. EASO also supports the external dimension of Europe's asylum system, through partnerships with third countries to reach common solutions. This includes capacity building, regional protection programmes, and coordinating Member States' resettlement actions. Established in 2010Located in Valletta, Maltawww.easo.europa.eu Signing of the Operating Plan with Bulgaria, 17 October 2013WORKING FOR YOU11 European Banking Authority - EBA The EBA helps maintain financial stability in the EU by safeguarding the integrity and efficiency of the banking sector. It creates common rules for all EU banks and provides tools for supervisors to consistently monitor banks across the single market. Through its Single Rule Book, it helps harmonise regulation, promoting a level playing field across the 28 Member States, as well as transparency and stability. It also monitors market developments, in order to identify potential risks. The EBA also supports the current major restructuring of banks to strengthen their business and has a prominent role in the EU-wide Stress Test exercise: it defines the common methodology for testing the resilience of EU banks in case of financial crisis. Protecting EU consumers is in its mandate too. The EBA monitors risks arising from financial innovation in key areas for consumers: mortgages, credit, savings products, credit cards and payment services, as well as new emerging issues such as virtual currencies. By ensuring banks are transparent and better capitalised, the EBA makes it easier for investors to provide finance and ensures that banks focus on their core purpose: providing money to individuals and businesses to invest and grow across the EU. Established in 2011Located in London, United Kingdomwww.eba.europa.eu European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control - ECDC The ECDC strengthens Europe's defences against infectious diseases. The Centre gathers, analyses and disseminates data on over 50 communicable diseases and conditions. As Europe's public health agency, ECDC puts science in the hands of decision-makers: one of the Centre's most important tasks is to offer scientific advice and guidance to the Member States. ECDC supports the EU's Early Warning and Response System on public health threats 365 days a year, summarising the main findings in its weekly online bulletin. ECDC also provides extensive training and preparedness activities to Member States and, when called on, offers hands-on technical support to the European Commission and Member States. An example of an important health EU-wide initiative coordinated by ECDC is European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD). It aims to provide a platform and support for national campaigns about prudent antibiotic use. Since 2008, the number of European countries participating in EAAD has increased from year to year with 45 countries in 2013 organising national EAAD events and campaigns during the week of 18 November. Established in 2005Located in Stockholm, Swedenwww.ecdc.europa.eu \u00a9Paul Gunning/Science Photo LibraryEU AGENCIES12 European Chemicals Agency - ECHA ECHA works on the safe use of chemicals. It implements the EU's ground-breaking chemicals legislation for the benefit of human health and the environment while supporting innovation and competitiveness. It helps companies comply with the legislation; advances the safe use of chemicals; provides information on chemicals; and addresses chemicals of concern. Thousands of chemical substances have already been registered, making ECHA's website the biggest regulatory source of information on chemicals in the world. ECHA maintains a list of substances of very high concern - for example chemicals which cause cancer and can affect human reproduction. As a next step, these substances may require prior authorisation before they can be used and will ultimately be removed from the market. This provides a strong incentive for companies to find safer alternatives for dangerous chemicals, thereby protecting human life and the environment. Established in 2007Located in Helsinki, Finlandwww.echa.europa.eu European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training - Cedefop Cedefop's research, analyses and forecasts help the European Commission, Member States and social partners to decide how vocational education and training should respond to the labour market's changing needs. Cedefop's skill forecasts show that between now and 2025 around 90% of job opportunities in the EU will be to replace people who leave their jobs, many of whom will retire in the next decade. Europe's ageing workforce is becoming better qualified, but jobs are becoming more demanding. Cedefop's reports on reforms to training systems show how Member States are tackling these issues, and Cedefop's expertise supports them. For example, Cedefop is helping Member States to work together to promote and improve apprenticeships. Cedefop designs and helps implement common European tools to make people's skills and qualifications easier to understand across countries. Tools such as the European qualifications framework, and the Europass diploma and certificate supplements, show how university and other diplomas correspond to qualifications in other counties. Over 40 million Europass CVs have been generated online since 2005, 8.7 million in 2013 alone, as more people use them to make their skills more visible to potential employers. Established in 1975Located in Thessaloniki, Greecewww.cedefop.europa.eu WORKING FOR YOU13 European Environment Agency - EEA The EEA provides independent, reliable and comparable environmental information on the state and trends of the European environment for those involved in developing, adopting, implementing and evaluating environmental policy, and also the general public. It carries this out in close cooperation with national environmental bodies, in its European Environmental Observation and information Network - EIONET. The EEA's knowledge base covers a wide range of environmental topics, including air quality, biodiversity, climate change mitigation and adaptation, sustainable consumption and production, water, land use, green economy, waste, chemicals, environment and health, and energy. For example, a recent EEA report found that despite significant improvements in Europe's air quality in recent decades, more than 90% of people in our cities still breathe air containing pollutants in concentrations above WHO guidelines. The EEA's reporting on the state and trends of the environment feeds into and supports the EU policy process, enabling new proposals to be based on the best available information. Recent examples are the 7th Environment Action Programme and the Clean Air Policy Package which was underpinned throughout by data and assessments provided by the agency. Established in 1990Located in Copenhagen, Denmarkwww.eea.europa.eu European Defence Agency - EDA EDA supports its Member States' efforts to enhance their defence capabilities in a collaborative manner. This means running and supporting cooperative European defence projects; supporting research and technology development; and boosting the European defence technological and industrial base. It publishes statistics from all Member States, as part of its yearly Defence Data. This yields a broad overview of Europe's Defence Market, providing information on defence expenditure, defence investment, spending on operations, maintenance and personnel. Military operations in Kosovo and Libya highlighted that EU countries lack air-to-air refuelling capabilities. EDA was given responsibility for addressing this shortfall over the short, medium, and long-term. To optimise existing capacity, the EDA, Italy, and the Movement Coordination Centre Europe jointly organised the first collective European air-to-air refuelling clearance trial in September 2013, with a second one to come in 2014. The first European Air-to-Air Refuelling training course took place in Eindhoven in April. In addition, EDA is supporting five countries that are coming together to purchase new multirole aircraft. Established in 2004Located in Brussels, Belgiumwww.eda.europa.eu EU AGENCIES14 European Food Safety Authority - EFSA EFSA is committed to ensuring food safety in Europe. It provides objective and independent scientific advice, and clear communication on existing and emerging risks to food and feed safety, grounded in the most up-to-date scientific information and knowledge. It provides a sound foundation for European policies and legislation, and supports EU bodies and Member States in taking effective and timely risk management decisions. EFSA is committed to openness and transparency in all its work. It was created to ensure a high level of consumer protection, and to restore and maintain confidence in the EU food supply following a series of food crises in the late 1990s. EFSA's remit spans the entire food chain from farm to fork. It also considers the possible impact on biodiversity, and it performs environmental risk assessments of genetically modified crops, pesticides, feed additives and plant pests. EFSA's advice underpins the European food safety system. Thanks to this system, European consumers are among the best protected and informed in the world regarding risks in the food chain. For example, EFSA's important contribution to joint EU measures helped reduce human cases of Salmonella by almost one-half from 2004 to 2009. It provided scientific advice on the impact of setting reduction targets for Salmonella in poultry and analysed the EU's progress in meeting the targets. Established in 2002Located in Parma, Italywww.efsa.europa.eu European Fisheries Control Agency - EFCA EFCA promotes the highest common standards for the control, inspection and surveillance of fishing under the EU's Common Fisheries Policy. It brokers operational coordination between Member States and the European Commission. It also contributes to coordination and cooperation between national control and inspection activities and gives assistance to the Commission and Member States. Thanks to the agency, around 9000 inspections were coordinated at the European level in 2013. The agency's contribution is crucial for a more uniform application of EU rules and to ensure that they are respected and applied effectively. It increases the effectiveness of control by providing training to inspectors and officials in fisheries control across the EU. It has developed the first core curricula courses on inspection. The inspection at sea module of EFCA's handbook and manual has been circulated to Member States and the European Commission. EFCA's data management systems also help improve transparency of and compliance with the requirements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy. Established in 2005Located in Vigo, Spainwww.efca.europa.eu WORKING FOR YOU15 European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions - Eurofound Eurofound's role is to provide knowledge in the area of social and work-related policies with a view to contributing to the planning and design of better living and working conditions in Europe. For example, its 2013 research on young people not in employment, education or training (NEET) estimated the economic loss arising from their disengagement from the labour market to be about \u20ac162 billion, or 1.26% of European G D P. Its research in this area has been widely circulated to key EU and national-level policymakers and cited in a range of EU policy documents, from the initiative of the European Commission on the Youth Guarantee, to the Recommendation approved by the Council and the European Parliament, as well as the Framework of actions on youth employment agreed by the European Social Partners. Other key highlights of Eurofound's work include its three pan- European surveys on working conditions, quality of life and company practices. Drawing on its network of correspondents across all Member States also allows Eurofound to complement its in-depth original research with timely comparative information from across the EU. This is presented via its online observatories, EurWORK and EMCC (the European Monitoring Centre on Change). Eurofound's tripartite structure underpins all its activities. Established in 1975Located in Dublin, Irelandwww.eurofound.europa.eu European GNSS Agency - GSA Linking space to user needs With a new generation of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which includes EGNOS and Galileo, Europe is opening new doors to industrial and economic growth.

It brings together leading higher education institutions, research labs and companies to form dynamic cross-border partnerships called Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs). These communities develop innovative products and services, start new companies, and train a new generation of entrepreneurs. To date, three such communities have been set up on climate, information and communication technologies, and energy, bringing together over 480 partners. Through the EIT's unique funding model, every euro invested from the EU budget triggers higher investment from other sources. The \u20ac300 million invested by the EIT into its KICs' activities between 2010 and 2013 resulted in 78.5% of funding from external sources. The EIT's communities are growing into thriving European innovation hubs. Since 2011, they have set up 18 innovation hotspots (Co-location Centres) across Europe, received over 12000 applications to EIT-labelled degree programmes (that is more than 12 applicants per offered seat), incubated more than 440 business ideas, created 75 start-ups, contributed to 164 knowledge transfers and adoptions, and resulted in 61 new products and services. The EIT makes innovation happen! Established in 2008 Located in Budapest, Hungarywww.eit.europa.eu European Institute for Gender Equality - EIGE Although equality between women and men has been one of the fundamental principles of the European Union since the very beginning, there is still a clear and demonstrated democratic deficit with regard to women's involvement in EU decision-making. The European Institute for Gender Equality's (EIGE) Gender Equality Index shows that despite strong commitments from the EU bodies and the Member States, the European Union is only half way towards a gender-equal society In order to support better-informed policy-making EIGE contributes to the promotion of equality between women and men in Europe through delivering high-level expertise to the European Commission, the Member States, the European Parliament and Enlargement countries. For example, EIGE's support to the EU Presidencies in reviewing and developing the UN indicators of the Beijing Platform for Action and its research on gender-based violence. EIGE was established to contribute to and strengthen the promotion of gender equality, including gender mainstreaming in all EU policies and the resulting national policies, and the ght against discrimination based on sex, as well as to raise EU citizens' awareness of gender equality. Equality between women and men is a fundamental right, common principle and core value of the European Union. Therefore 'Making equality between women and men a reality for all Europeans and beyond' is the vision of EIGE. To make this vision a reality, EIGE is to become the knowledge centre and the front-runner in developing reliable evidence, collecting knowledge, sharing useful experiences and expertise on gender equality.

Established in 2005 (2001)Located in Budapest, Hungary.www.cepol.europa.euEuropean Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA The EMCDDA is the central source and confirmed authority on drug-related issues in Europe. For over 20 years, it has been collecting, analysing and disseminating scientifically sound information on drugs and drug addiction, and their consequences, providing its audiences with an evidence-based picture of Europe's drug phenomenon. Information of this kind is vital to help Europe understand and respond to its drug problems. Today, the agency offers policy makers the data they need for drawing up robust drug laws and strategies. It also helps professionals and practitioners pinpoint best practice and new areas of research. One of the agency's key tasks is to detect new drugs appearing in Europe that could pose risks to citizens. In cooperation with EU bodies and Member States, it carries out early-warning and risk-assessment activities that may pave the way for legal controls. To date, the EMCDDA and its partners have detected over 350 uncontrolled substances appearing for the first time in Europe. Over 80 new drugs were detected in 2013 alone. The EMCDDA has also facilitated the creation of national drug monitoring centres across Europe, which play a vital role in collecting and interpreting data. This Europe-wide information network (Reitox) contributes to the agency's core business of reporting consistent and harmonised information on drugs needed for sound policy making.

Europol's operational support activities have led to the disruption of many criminal and terrorist networks, the arrest of thousands of dangerous criminals, the recovery of millions of euros in criminal proceeds, and the rescue of hundreds of victims, including children trafficked for sexual exploitation. As no crime is as borderless as cybercrime, the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) was therefore established at Europol to be the focal point in the EU's fight against cybercrime. Europol supports EU Member States and institutions in building operational and analytical capacity for investigations. It also cooperates with international partners in the pursuit of an EU free from cybercrime. EC3 activities cover combating crimes from malware, hacking, phishing, intrusion, manipulation, identity theft and payment fraud, and the grooming and online sexual exploitation of children.

It provides technical and operational expertise to ensure that everyone from EU citizens to third country nationals are free to live, work and travel in a manner they have come to know and hold dear. It manages the operation of the SIS II system for sharing information on criminal matters to ensure the coordinated investigation of crimes that do not respect national borders, the Visa Information System (VIS) for fair and secure management of visa application and border entry processes, and the Eurodac system for the monitoring of asylum applications from those who may need protection under EU values and norms. By the end of 2013, SIS II had handled over 50 million alerts. The VIS had registered over 4 million visa applications in its first two years while Eurodac dealt with over 300,000 transactions related to asylum seekers in 2013. Recently, eu-LISA has doubled the VIS' capacity and search capability allowing it to process up to 120 000 transactions/hour and it is rolling out a completely new system in terms of infrastructure, software and search. It has also improved technical controls that ensure security of personal data and respect for the rules. Established in 2012Located in Tallinn, Estoniawww.eulisa.europa.eu European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights - FRA The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees everyone in the EU their fundamental rights. In practice many are deprived of these rights. FRA provides evidence-based advice to EU institutions and Member States so they can make fundamental rights a reality for everyone. FRA does this through its large-scale surveys, and comparative legal and social research and by working with fundamental rights actors EU-wide. Hate crime and discrimination often remain 'invisible' due to widespread underreporting of incidents, as FRA research consistently reveals. FRA surveys on violence against women, minorities, lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) people and antisemitism point to the need to urgently address underreporting through awareness raising, victim support and training - e.g. only 22% of the most serious LGBT hate crime incidents were brought to the police's attention. FRA has shown anyone can be a victim. It is well placed to give a voice to majority and hard-to-reach populations - such as ethnic minorities, children and people with disabilities on issues such as data protection violations, access to justice and hate crime. For example, FRA research on hate crime has directly fed into Council Conclusions. It is also working closely with Member States to assist them help end hate crime and the fear people feel of simply being themselves.

Network and information security is crucial for the daily life of business, governments and citizens alike, as well as for the economy of Europe. Thus, ENISA is focussed on the preparedness and prevention efforts needed to protect computer systems against unauthorized access, attacks or failure. The agency prevents, responds, maps, analyses, advises and communicates about cyber security and cyber risks. It is the only body which delivers these services; there is no equivalent private sector organisation which provides this neutral, expert cyber security recommendations at EU level. Moreover, it establishes solid network and information security standards to support the EU business case for cyber security. ENISA also regularly produces its annual ENISA Threat Landscape report, showing global trends and tendencies in an aggregated analyses of over 250 reports from all over the world. It reveals how different attack methods are being used.Based on this report, operators and stakeholders can react and instantly take precautionary measures to better protect their networks. It also conducts the bi-annual \"Cyber Europe\" exercise (2010, 2012, 2014) involving governments, industry actors; in all hundreds of \"players\", preparing for cyber-attacks cooperation across the borders.\" Established in 2004Located in Heraklion (headquarters) and an office in Athens, Greecewww.enisa.europa.eu (c) ShutterstockEU Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders - Frontex Each year over 700 million passengers are estimated to cross Europe's external borders. One of the biggest challenges, therefore, is detecting illegal activities without creating unnecessary delays for other travellers. As there are no internal border controls between Schengen countries, external border controls are even more important, as Schengen members rely on the quality of border checks and surveillance carried out by other Member States. Frontex assists EU Member States, and countries within the Schengen passport-free travel area, manage their external borders and brings greater consistency and harmonisation to EU border control. It facilitates cooperation between border authorities by providing technical support and expertise where and when it is needed. It also promotes solidarity among Member States by coordinating assistance to those facing disproportionate pressures at their external borders. Frontex does this through risk analysis - analysing trends in unauthorised border crossings and other cross-border crime; running joint operations - coordinating the deployment of specialists and technical equipment to border areas in need; rapid response - coordinating the short-term deployment of European Border Guard Teams at the request of Member States; research and development - linking border control authorities with research and industry; training - developing harmonised curricula and training standards; joint returns - coordinating joint repatriation flights of third country nationals between member countries; and via information sharing - enabling swift and reliable data exchange between border authorities. Established in 2004Located in Warsaw, Polandwww.frontex.europa.eu EU AGENCIES26 European Union Satellite Centre - EU SatCen The EU SatCen supports EU foreign and security policy decision making by providing geospatial intelligence products and services, primarily through the analysis of data from Earth observation satellites. It provides early warning of potential crises to decision makers in order to enable timely, diplomatic, economic and humanitarian measures, including generic planning for intervention. It responds to requests from different users such as the European External Action Service, Member States, the European Commission, as well as third countries and international organisations such as the United Nations. For example, the Council of the EU asked the SatCen to start monitoring the crisis in Syria in 2013 to support UN missions to Syria, such as its Supervision Mission, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - UN Joint Mission and the UN Disengagement Observer Force. The products were for example related to border crossing points, refugee camps, shipping activity, evacuations, damage assessment and the inspection and verification of the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria.

It coordinates investigations and prosecutions in the 28 Member States, and improves cooperation between national authorities. It also prevents and resolves conflicts of jurisdiction between Member States, and can offer support beyond the EU's borders based on its cooperation agreements with non-EU countries. In 2013, Eurojust assisted 1,576 cases involving terrorism, drug trafficking, illegal immigration and human trafficking, fraud, corruption, cybercrime (including images of child sexual abuse), criminal offences affecting the EU's financial interests, organised and environmental crime. Eurojust organises coordination meetings, where judicial and police authorities can build mutual trust while exchanging information, identifying and solving legal and practical difficulties arising from the 30 different legal systems in the EU. In 2013, 206 such meetings were held. It also sets up coordination centres, where arrests, house searches, seizures and other measures can be coordinated in real time on an agreed common action day. Another important coordination tool is the joint investigation team (JIT). Eurojust supports the setting up and functioning of these teams, e.g. identifying suitable cases, drafting agreements and operational action plans, developing best practice, and can also provide funding. Eurojust supported 102 JITs in 2013, of which 34 were funded.
