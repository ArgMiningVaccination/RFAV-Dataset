The amount of non -monetary remuneration, etc. above is recorded as expenses in the current fiscal year. Policy on Determining Remuneration Amounts and Calculation Methods Established Disclosure of Policy on Determining Remuneration Amounts and Calculation Methods Remuneration for directors is determined within the total amount of remuneration set by resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders. This is comprised of monthly fixed base remuneration, bonuse s determined by results and other factors for each fiscal year , and restricted stock compensation introduced in FY2018 (consisting of medium-term performance -linked compensation and long-term stock -based com pensation). Outside directors only receive base remuneration. Base remuneration is determined based on the base remuneration table according to the position and role of directors with due consideration of the management environment and global trends. Bonuses are paid as cash remuneration , which reflects performance indicators (core operating profit excluding sales of assets, etc., consolidated profit and other total perfo rmance evaluation as directors) to heighten the awareness of improving performance for each fiscal year. As short -term incentives, they are determined based on the calculation table according to performance such as achievement of targeted profits and other factors in each fiscal year and paid in June of each year. Stock -based compensation is granted in July of each year based on the grant table according to the position and role of directors. For medium -term performance -linked stock compensation in particul ar, performance is evaluated based on the status of achievement in FY2022 for the portion to be granted for the three years between FY2020 and FY2022 from the period of STS2030 Phase 1 (FY2020 to FY2024) , using revenue, overseas net sales, core operating p rofit, ROE and the ranking in total shareholder return (TSR) among 12 competitors , including the Company (relative TSR) , as quantitative indicators and taking into consideration the status of ESG, compliance and development associated with COVID -19. Thus , the ratio of lifting the transfer restriction (100% to 0%) is determined . In addition, when lifting the transfer restriction, 50% of the amount of stock -based compensation, translated into the share price at the time of lifting, is paid as monetary compensation. The Compensation Advisory Committee discusses the ratio of remun eration by type for executive directors in consideration of remuneration levels using companies that have a similar business size to the Company and are in cluded among the relevant business types and categories as the benchmark, and the Board of Directors, in respect of the recommendations given by the Compensation Advisory Committee, determines the details of the remuneration system, etc. so that the ratio of remuneration by type is in line with the recommendations. The policy for determination thereof is as described in \"Policy for Determination of Details of Individual Remuneration, etc. for Directors .\" In addition, pursuant to the resolution at the Board of Directors meeting held on February 22, 2021, it is considered appropriate that base remuneration a nd individual bonus amount, etc. are evaluated and determined by a person who bears the ultimate management responsibility, and thus, such evaluation and determination are Translation for reference only 25 entrusted to Isao Teshirogi, Representative Director and President. The Compensation Advisory Committee deliberates the policy and criteria for the entrustment and provides the Board of Directors with the results as recommendations for their resolution, and Isao Teshirogi, Representative Director and President, to whom such determination is entrusted, shall make decisions in accordance with said recommendations and the abovementioned resolution by the Board of Directors. Following revisions in FY2021 to the medium -term performance -linked, stock -based remuneration table so as to place more emphasis on performance and on the standpoint of shareholders , the system is designed so that the targeted ratio for each type of remuneration, etc. will be base remuneration: performance -linked remuneration, etc.: non -monetary remuneration, etc. = roughly 1 :1:1 on the premise that all KPIs are achieved. (Note) Performance -linked remuneration, etc. comprises director and Kansayaku bonuses , and non - monetary re muneration, etc. comprises restricted stock. As a result, the ratio of base remuneration in total remuneration in FY2021 is about 35%, due in part to the achievement status of the profit target and the impact of share prices on stock -based compensation . Remuneration for Kansayaku is determined within the total amount of remuneration set by resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders. This encompasses the monthly fixed base remuneration. As an advisory body to the Board of Directors, the Company's Compensation Advisory Committee consists of five members, a majority of whom are outside directors, and is chaired by an outside director. The Committee duly considers director and Kansayaku remu neration.

Using revenue, over seas net sales, core operating profit, ROE and the rank ing in total shareholder return (TSR) among 12 competitors including the Company (relative TSR) as quantitative indicators , performance evaluation is determin ed by the Board of Directors, after deliber ation on the overall evaluation by the Compensation Advisory Committee, in consideration of the status of ESG, compliance and development associated with COVID -19. 4.

This has resulted in the establishment of a framework in which each executive organization monitors the progress of business execution on matters for which a management decision was made and reports to the Corporate Executive Management Meeting, the Board of Directors, etc. on a timely basis. The Company has opted to be a company with a Kansayaku Board to ensure such duties are performed in a legally compliant and smooth manner , by coordinating the audit functions of the Kansayaku , the business audits by internal audits, and the supervisory functions of the Board of D irectors. The Company has a framework that separates business management and business execution, under which the Board of Directors is responsible for making management decisions in line with the Group's medium - to long -term plans, while the Business Execu tion Framework that is mainly comprised of executive officers is responsible for business execution through rapid and flexible decision -making.

All three outside directors are independent appointments and understand corporate responsibility of the Company, contributing to increas ing transparency in management . The Board of Directors is advised by the Nomination Advisory Committee ( three outside directors , one inside director , and one outside Kansayaku ) and the Compensation Advisory Committee ( three outside directors , one in side director , and one corporate Kansayaku ), which are chaired by outside directors. To ensure management decisions are equitable, these committees carefully assess the aptitude of candidates for director positions, the impact dir ectors have on business management, and the suitability of individuals for certain roles and their respective levels of remuneration. Business Execution Framework In addition, the Company has introduced an executive officer system to support dynamic and flexible business operations, enabling the Group to respond rapidly to significant changes in the operating environment. The Company has also established the Corporate Executive Meeting as a body to discuss business execution. It is composed of directors, Kansayaku and the corporate officers responsible for business execution and meets every week in principle. The Corporate Executive Meeting is a forum for discussing issues related to busine ss execution and important management matters. Business execution involves four jurisdictions - R&D, healthcare business, supply and corporate - and ten divisions - the Research Division , which engages in research and development ; the Drug Development and Regulatory Science Division ; the Bio-pharmaceutical R&D Division ; the Pharmaceutical Commercial Division , which communicates information about drugs ; the Integrated Disease Care Division , which collect s and analyze s healthcare information to maximize the value of the Company; the Global Business Division , which strategically promotes overseas business development ; the Corporate Strategy Division , which is responsible for formulating and implementing company -wide strategies for the allocatio n and utilization of managerial resources ; the Administration Division , which support s corporate activities in terms of personnel, organization, and laws and regulations ; the DX Promotion Division , which is responsible for building infrastructure for data utilization and IT/security to support the creation and realization of healthcare solutions using digital technology ; and the Corporate Quality Assurance Division , which is responsible for assuring the qual ity of marketed products . The Corporate Executive Meeting thoroughly deliberates on the execution of business, and the Board of Directors makes decisions on matters that affect management. Audit Framework To ensure directors and each organization in the Company conduct their duties in a legally compliant and appropriate manner, the Company has established systems to enable Kansayaku and the Internal Control Department, which is responsible for conducting internal audits, to carry out a udits of business execution and exchange opinions with the representative directors as required.
