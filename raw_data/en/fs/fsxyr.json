Here you will learn everything you've ever wanted to know about this crystal including Amethyst healing properties, Amethyst metaphysical properties, using Amethyst in meditation, Feng Shui, spiritual work, and much more! Quick Overview of Amethyst Pronunciation Amethyst (am thist) Amethyst Meanings and Introduction Amethyst has been highly esteemed throughout the ages for its stunning beauty and legendary powers to stimulate, and soothe, the mind and emotions. It is a semi-precious stone in today's classifications, but to the ancients, it was a \"Gem of Fire\"; a Precious Stone worth, at times in history, as much as a Diamond. Amethyst has always been associated with February, the month the Romans dedicated to Neptune, their water god. Therefore, it should be no surprise that it is the traditional birthstone of that month. It is the stone of St. Valentine and faithful love and signifies ecclesiastical dignity as the Bishop's Stone. It carries the energy of fire and passion, creativity and spirituality; yet bears the logic of temperance and sobriety. Whether its crystals are left natural, polished as tumbled stones, or faceted into magnificent jewels, Amethyst is a gem whose beauty transcends its commonality. It is a variety of Quartz found in many locations around the world. It forms as transparent, terminated crystals of all sizes in geodes, clusters, and as long single terminations. Amethyst is also found in vitreous masses and polished into wonderful specimens and personal talismans. The presence of manganese in clear Quartz produces Amethyst, while additional amounts of iron vary the purple coloration. It ranges in hue from pale red-violet to deep violet and may be transparent or opaque. In addition, it is sometimes layered with white Quartz as Chevron Amethyst, found in combination with Cacoxenite, mixed with Citrine as Ametrine, or in rare cases, \"rutilated\" with Goethite. \"A favorite of Amethyst healing benefits is its ability to expand the higher mind also enhances one's creativity and passion.\" The name Amethyst is derived from the Greek word am\u00e9thystos (), meaning \"not intoxicated\", and comes from an ancient legend. The wine god Bacchus, angry over an insult and determined to avenge himself, decreed the first person he should meet would be devoured by his tigers. The unfortunate mortal happened to be a beautiful maiden named Amethyst on her way to worship at the shrine of Diana. As the ferocious beasts sprang, she sought the protection of the goddess and was saved by being turned into a clear, white crystal. Bacchus, regretting his cruelty, poured the juice of his grapes over the stone as an offering; giving the gem its lovely purple hue. Throughout history, the special virtue of Amethyst has been that of preventing drunkenness and overindulgence. Ancient Greeks and Romans routinely studded their goblets with Amethyst believing that wine drunk from an Amethyst cup would not lead to intoxication. They also believed that an Amethyst worn on the body, especially at the navel, had a sobering effect not only for inebriation but for over-zealousness in passion as well. Catholic bishops also wore Amethyst in a ring to protect them from mystical intoxication. Kissing the ring kept others from similar mystical intoxication and kept them grounded in spiritual thought. \"In the spiritual world, an Amethyst crystal provides a connection to the Divine.\" Some historical Amethyst healing reports include its ability to control evil thoughts, increase intelligence, and render men shrewd in business matters. For travelers, it was worn as protection from treachery and surprise attacks. It also kept soldiers from harm and gave them victory over their enemies. It lent assistance to hunters in the capture of wild beasts and fowl. On the other side, it was considered to be a powerful psychic stone of protection against witchcraft and black magic. Like other royal stones, it protected its wearer from disease and infection. In the spiritual world, an Amethyst crystal provided a connection to the Divine. To the Hebrews, it was Ahlamah, the ninth stone in the breastplate of the High Priest; engraved with the tribe of Dan, as well as the twelfth foundation stone for the New Jerusalem. To the Egyptians, it was Hemag, listed in the Book of the Dead to be carved into heart-shaped amulets for burial. In Eastern cultures, it was listed in descriptions of sacred \"gem-cities\", \"trees of life\", and used in temple offerings for worship. It was also often used to align planetary and astrological influences. Additionally, Amethyst was popular in rosaries and prayer beads. It was credited with creating an atmosphere of pious calm, imbuing a sense of mental peace, and quietude. \"Amethyst's inherent high frequency purifies the aura of any negative energy or attachments and creates a protective shield of Light around the body.\" In today's world, Amethyst healing properties and meanings are similar to their historic roots. It is still a remarkable stone of spirituality and contentment; known for its metaphysical abilities to still the mind and inspire an enhanced meditative state. Its inherent high frequency purifies the aura of any negative energy or attachments. It creates a protective shield of Light around the body, allowing one to remain clear and centered while opening to spiritual direction. Amethyst stimulates the Third Eye, Crown, and Etheric Chakras enhancing cognitive perception as well as accelerating the development of intuitive and psychic ability. It initiates wisdom and greater understanding and is a stone of comfort for those grieving the loss of a loved one. Amethyst's ability to expand the higher mind also enhances one's creativity and passion. It strengthens the imagination and intuition and refines the thinking processes. It helps in the assimilation of new ideas, putting thought into action, and brings projects to fruition. Amethyst is also well-known as a talisman of focus and success. Amethyst is an exceptional crystal for wearing on the body, for use in healing rituals, and for enhancing one's environment. It has been known to fade in direct sunlight and care should be taken. It is also good to clear its energies from time to time by holding the stone under running water for a short period while affirming that the stone is cleared.

Amethyst Meanings in Ancient Lore and History According to Ovid, the Roman poet, Amethyst was a nymph pursued by Bacchus. Desperate to escape him, she called on the goddess Diana who rescued her by transforming her into a shiny stone of \"pure, cold crystal\". Furious, Bacchus threw his glass filled with wine on the stone giving it its purple color. There are various stories and sources for this legend, sometimes with Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, sometimes with Dionysus, the Greek god of intoxication. In addition, all credit wine as the reason for the crystal's hue. The use of Amethyst can be traced as far back as 25,000 B.C. to the Neolithic people in Europe. Its spiritual and legendary energies made it popular for beads and amulets in many cultures. Later, as a stone of royalty, it was utilized in crowns, scepters, and jewelry. Ancient Egyptians used it as a healing stone to ease fears and guilt, and as a strong protector while traveling. Greeks and Romans used it constantly to protect themselves from excesses of overindulgence with food and drink, and its powerful healing effect upon the mind made it valuable for placement under the pillow at bedtime to cure insomnia and induce pleasant dreams. For headaches, it was warmed and placed on the forehead or temples to reduce throbbing. \"It was once believed a person could summon any love by speaking his or her name in an Amethyst.\" Amethyst was considered a powerful psychic stone of protection against witchcraft and black magic and was said to lose its color and turn pale when placed near an angry attacker. The Peruvians held a belief that if the names of the sun and the moon were engraved on an Amethyst and hung around one's neck with a baboon's hair or a swallow's feather, it would act as a spell against witchcraft. Similarly, the ancient philosopher Pliny the Elder claimed an Amethyst engraved with figures of the sun and the moon immunized people against poisons. A bear engraved on an Amethyst had the virtue of putting demons to flight and defended and preserved the wearer from drunkenness. In folklore, it was thought to deter animal fleas. It was once believed a person could summon any love by speaking his or her name in an Amethyst, even if the person was committed to another. Amethyst is listed as the twelfth foundation stone of the New Jerusalem. It was considered by some to be inscribed with the name of the apostle Matthew and was emblematic of his conversion and sobriety. In the 10th century, Andreas, bishop of Caesarea, believed the Amethyst, with its fiery aspect, signified Matthias. Chosen by the apostles to replace Judas following his betrayal of Jesus, Matthias was filled with celestial fire and zeal like Amethyst. \"Amethyst, the stone of February, is considered a Gem of Spring.\" The Rosicrucian society, which combined pagan with Christian types and figures, saw Amethyst and its color as a symbol of the divine male sacrifice since the stone and color were typical of love, truth, passion, suffering, and hope. The love of Christ led him to make the ultimate sacrifice and suffer the agony of the cross, and the crucifixion was followed by the resurrection; thus came the hope of mankind to enjoy eternal happiness in heaven. Amethyst, the stone of February, should also be worn on Thursdays, \"Thor's Day\". It is considered a Gem of Spring. Though historically given as a gift on the seventeenth wedding anniversary, it is now listed as the official anniversary gemstone for the sixth anniversary.
