In \u00d2I Will Survive\u00d3 (can\u00d5t you just hear the music?), Ron Rosenes tries to figure out why he\u00d5s still here20 years after his HIV diagnosis: \u00d2It may be partgenetic and it may be part luck, but sometimes Ithink it\u00d5s just pure pluck.\u00d3 Many people who can afford and tolerate HIV drugs attribute their longevity to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). But although meds may be part of what helps you stay alive, as we hear from Rosenes and four other long-term survivors inthis issue, there are many more ingredients for survival\u00d1such aseating well, taking good care of yourself, doing your homework,finding support, healing your heart, minding your mind, anddealing with addictions, to name a few. Oh, and a dash of love,of course. What are the ingredients youpour into living your wild and precious life? It\u00d5s something you may want to think about. With The Positive Side , we hope to give you some food for thought. In this issue, Lark Lands dishes out her grocery list of15 food groups for some quick and easy ways to boost nutrition(two recipes included!). Albert McLeod\u00d5s article on the HIV/AIDSMedicine Wheel describes a unique, holistic approach to lookingat life with HIV. And in \u00d2Better Living through Rehab,\u00d3 PeterWilliams serves up an array of choices to help improve your overall health and quality of life. Perhaps there are some ingredients you\u00d5d rather keep out of your pantry (and panties)\u00d1such as cigarettes and syphilis\u00d1becausethe problems they cause you can most likely do without. Andthen there are side effects, which make living with HIV all themore challenging. In Chatty CATIE, five people with HIV candidlyshare their side effect struggles\u00d1with fatigue, anemia, nausea,diarrhea and facial wasting\u00d1and dole out advice on how to deal.

RONNILYN PUSTILSYPHILIS IS BACK 17SYPHILIS IS BACK PUSTIL Senior Editor SEAN HOSEIN Publisher CATIE THANK YOU TO EVAN COLLINS, MD, FOR MEDICAL REVIEW.Contributors WALTER ARMSTRONG,BEVERLY DEUTSCH, DIANA JOHANSEN, LARK LANDS, SUSAN MASSARELLA, JAKE PETERS, TIM ROGERS,LAURA WHITEHORN Creative Direction & Design STUDIO BELLO!Canadian AIDS Treatment Information Exchange (CATIE)555 Richmond Street West #505 Toronto ON M5V 3B1 ' 1191-9809 Publications Agreement Number 1707361FEELING GROOVY Apart from the fact that Judy Weiser\u00d5s writing is so well crafted, focused, clear and accessible, I found her articlevery helpful (\u00d2How Does It Feel?\u00d3fall/winter 2003). It reminded me of allthat I\u00d5ve done for myself through thesemany years with HIV to LIVE as healthilyas possible. I felt validated in havinggreatly influenced HIV\u00d5s effect on me. Italso reminded me of the importance of\u00d2staying the course\u00d3\u00d1an encouragementI need as I occasionally find myselfwandering off track. This article verypositively affected my day\u00c9which, ofcourse, leads to the next! David N. Vancouver LIPO LINES Abig thank you to Wayne Stump for putting into words what I\u00d5ve been feeling lately (\u00d2In Your Face,\u00d3 fall/winter2003). I was struck by Stump\u00d5s candourand the way he expressed himself. I, too,have the \u00d2lipo-look\u00d3 and I\u00d5m consideredno longer \u00d2passable\u00d3 in the community. Since my facial appearance has changed I\u00d5ve become more sensitized to howacutely aware I am of how Toronto\u00d5spositive community subdivides itself:those on meds vs. those not on meds,those working vs. those on disability,those with lipo vs. those without.\u00c9andso on. The downside has certainly been a loss of self, a loss of control (my HIVstatus being \u00d2outed\u00d3 by lipo) and adevalued cach\u008e or gay currency (if youcan call it that) in this image-consciousgay community. The one silver lining I\u00d5ve observed in my own experience is that since I\u00d5vebecome more withdrawn due to my lipoI\u00d5ve had to learn to spend more timewith myself and explore the non-physical(or spiritual) side of me. Having lipo hasalso given me the ability to be moreempathetic to the plight of others. Alas, the loss of intimacy at times faroutweighs any physical loss\u00d1a fact of lifethat\u00d5s hard to get used to.I see our American contemporaries scrambling for quick-fix solutions (Bio-Alcamid, silicone, artecoll injections) and Ioften wonder if a cosmetic solution couldsomehow lessen the impact of \u00d2branding\u00d3that lipo has on one\u00d5s psyche/identity. Rob C. Toronto As I read Wayne Stump\u00d5s article, I felt like I was reading my own story. I\u00d5ve been on the same meds for more than fiveyears and lipo has also left its footprintson my face. However, I\u00d5m grateful for thehealth that I continue to have. I\u00d5ve lostmany friends, and I\u00d5ve found that the bestway for me to honour their lives was topick up their torches and carry on thework so many of them had started. As a peer counsellor at Living Positive in Edmonton, I talk to people about livingwith HIV\u2014how it\u00d5s not fun and it\u00d5s a lot of work but certainly NOT the end of theworld. A few years ago, I put together aproject called The Living Quilt\u2014a hugegeneric quilt with people\u00d5s names onribbons. Each ribbon is pinned to the quilt with a button that has the number of years they\u00d5ve been living with HIV(currently ranging from 1 to 23). It\u00d5s apowerful, tangible image showing peoplethat they\u00d5re not alone and that they stillhave a future. Thank you for also reminding me that I\u00d5m not alone. Gil C. Edmonton THE NAME GAME Ilike your magazine and the wealth of information it offers to HIV positive people and those who have beendiagnosed with AIDS, and to theprofessionals who work in this field. I\u00d5d like to offer a suggestion concerning the use of the acronym PHAs. Your magazine is directed at people who are HIV positive but not necessarilydiagnosed with AIDS, so why not callthem \u00d2Positive People\u00d3? correct, more empowering and less stigmatizing than \u00d2PHAs.\u00d3 Keep up the good work. We all look forward to the next issue and find the magazine to be so useful andempowering to our positive clients. Ken Salter Coordinator, Prison Outreach Support Services and Education Program The AIDS Society of Kamloops, BC PSresponds: Thank you for your positive feedback. The magazine isintended for all people living with HIV\u00d1whether they\u00d5re asymptomatic,symptomatic or diagnosed with AIDS.We\u00d5ve adopted the acronym PHA (which stands for People with HIV/AIDS)because it\u00d5s inclusive, concise andcommonly used. The last thing we\u00d5d wantis for readers to feel stigmatized by ouruse of this acronym. SPRING SUMMER 2004 03Please drop us a line with your comments about The Positive Side . We can\u00d5t promise to run your letter, but if we do, we\u00d5ll be in touch, so be sure to provide your contact information. Send letters to The Positive Side at: mail: 555 Richmond Street Viral load: 3,000. CD4 count: 250. Montreal, Quebec Idon't remember a time when I didn't have diarrhea . It's the worst side effect I've experienced. The meds, especiallytriple therapy, have made the runs acommon occurrence in my life, but I'velearned to manage it. When I'm on a really strict diet\u2014no coffee or beer, and very lean meats\u2014Ihave no problems. Not long ago I visitedmy mom, who's really into health food,tofu, herbal tea and all. She eats mealsregularly and doesn't drink alcohol, andafter two weeks at her house, I had abeautiful stool. It even floated! But this kind of lifestyle takes the fun out of life for me, and I'd rather notdeprive myself. I'm not going to miss outon anything. If I'm going to indulge, I takeImodium and deal with the consequences.I can afford to do this because I have ahealthy weight and lots of energy. If I wereso sick that I lost weight and felt tired allthe time, I'd be more disciplined. Advice: Y ou must adapt to whatever life throws your way. I always have spareunderwear wherever I go. My friendssometimes tease me about it. Be positiveand surround yourself with like-mindedpeople. I go out and have a blast. Diseasefeeds off depression. Think positive, nomatter the side effects, because there'salways a solution.HIV isn't something I thinkabout a lot. Fatigue is. It started gradually about fouryears ago, and I don't know ifit's the meds or the disease. I get very frustrated because sometimes it's hard for me tomake plans. I want to be up at6:30 every morning and go allday, but this morning I didn'tcrawl out of bed until 9 o'clock.Because a lot of my friendsdon't know about my HIVstatus, I worry it makes me looka little unreliable. I wonder ifthey think, \"She's always tired,what's her problem?\" I cross-country ski and do drumming and African dance,all very intense activities. Quiteoften I push myself. Last night,I went to my drumming classand could barely function. But I'm trying to be more nurturing and flexible withmyself. Sometimes I'll stayhome and read or take a bath.Once a week I try to get a long(12- or 14-hour) sleep, usuallyon the weekend. That seems torev me up enough for the startof the next week. I'm alsogetting into gentler activities,like yoga and stretching. I findit very relaxing and satisfying,and I feel like I'm still doingsomething for my body. Advice: Be realistic about what you can accomplish and staywithin those limits. Be kind toyourself. We live in a worldwhere everything is so fastpaced. There's not a lot ofaffirmation for being easy onyourself. I have to get that kindof affirmation from myself. SPRING SUMMER 2004 05 THE POSITIVE SIDE04Side effects suck. Sometimes they\u00d5re so bad that people stop taking their HIV drugs. Skipping doses of yourmeds can spell drug resistance and treatment failure, sending yourhealth into a downward spiral. If your meds are making you sick,tell your doctor right away. There are many ways to handle sideeffects. If you can\u00d5t find a solution, your doc may be able to switch you to a more tolerable drug. Also, ask other people withHIV/AIDS how they cope. That\u00d5s what we did. The following fivename their worst side effect and describe how they dealt. In January 2003, I started experiencing extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, a racingheartbeat and intermittentfevers. It really affected howmuch I could do in a day, andoverall I felt very unwell. Myblood work showed I had verylow hemoglobin and severe anemia . Shortly after that, I was diagnosed withhyperthyroidism (Gravesdisease), which isn't related toHIV . One of the symptoms isslight anemia, so we thoughtGraves might be the cause.However, after treating mythyroid, the anemia persisted. Iwasn't producing any red bloodcells and became dependant onblood transfusions\u2014every twoor three weeks. Last year I hadmore than 12 transfusions. We didn't think it was a side effect of my HIV drugs becausenone of the meds I was takingwere known to cause anemia. Isaw several specialists and weruled out all the opportunisticinfections. I had two bonemarrow biopsies and two CAT-scans. I got my nutrition levelstested, and they were allnormal. All this time my CD4 count was stable with anundetectable viral load. Living with the unknown was very stressful and scary. Iwas asking myself: \"Is this thebeginning of the end?\" All thedoctors were scratching theirheads. I was doing my ownresearch, too, but we kepthitting a brick wall. A fewdoctors said, \"If it's any of thedrugs, it's the ddI Solast August we switched the ddIto tenofovir [Viread]. Afterabout weeks, I started need any moreblood transfusions. It's weirdbecause I'd been on ddI for fiveyears, and then suddenly thisrare side effect occurred. Advice: Strange things can and do happen with these meds. Notall the long-term side effects areknown. My experience showedme the importance of havingblood work done regularly andreporting every change in myhealth to my doctor. When youdo have a side effect, hang inthere. There's often a way tomanage it.Kath Webster, 40 Volunteer treatment information counsellor and educator, Diagnosed with HIV: 1995. Viral load: undetectable. CD4 count: 400. Vancouver, BCAbout six years ago, two weeks into taking meds for the first time (AZT, 3TC and Crixivan) I became so nauseous.I was living off Ensure because I couldn'tkeep anything down. When I'd throw up,all I could taste was chemicals and italways happened shortly after taking theCrixivan, so I knew it was the medication.It was horrible. I was basically stuck athome because I was so sick and I had totake a leave from my job. My doctor said that after four weeks of being on the meds the nausea would subside. So I stayed on the regimen butkept getting sick. I tried everything\u2014eating crackers, taking Gravol tablets, evenmarijuana\u2014but nothing helped. After about three months I was hospitalized for an infection. My doctoradministered IV Gravol, which didnothing to combat the nausea. He thenprescribed Stemitil, typically used forchemotherapy patients. Although I wasstill extremely nauseous, I wasn't vomitingas much. This was a blessing, as I couldkeep down solid food and my meds. Of course, you have to take your meds faithfully. But I ended up developingresistance to them because I couldn't keepthem down. At one point, I said to myself:\"I'm taking these drugs to save my life,but what about quality of life?\" So, Istopped taking them all. I felt so guiltythat I didn't tell my doctor or see her foreight months. Then I moved from a small town to Vancouver and started seeing a specialist. Itold her about the side effect and howmany pills I was taking each day. Sheswitched me to a different cocktail thatwas more conducive to my lifestyle(Videx, Viramune and 3TC)\u2014just ninepills a day compared to 20 pills daily. Itolerated my new regimen really well. Butafter six months I got neuropathy in myfeet. I went to my doctor right away andwent off the meds. I learned from my firstexperience not to wait and do nothing.Now, I'm not taking any meds. I think Ishould wait until I really need them. For more info, see CATIE\u00d5s Practical Guide to HIV Drug Side Effects at www.catie.ca/sideeffects_e.nsfInterviews by Diane PetersEdna Lafayette, 46 Masters student. Diagnosed with 1992. Viral load: undetectable. CD4 count: 500. Guelph, OntarioAdvice: Don't compromise your quality of life. I needlessly suffered on a drug thatdidn't work for me because I didn't feel Icould be honest with my doctor about theproblems I was having. I thought I wasgoing to disappoint her by letting her knowI wasn't tolerating it. Looking back, all I didwas prevent myself from getting the besttreatment possible. My first doctor wasn't aspecialist and I think it's important to seesomeone knowledgeable about HIV . It's so important to be compliant with your meds. When I finally found a combothat worked for me, after awhile I startedbecoming complacent, thinking itwouldn't hurt to miss a dose here andthere. For this reason my treatment failedand I became resistant to 3TC.In 1997, I got very sick and went on proteaseinhibitors. I started to feel better and my counts slowly improved, but I began to look worse. Afterabout six months, I developed lipodystrophy .A t first, my arms and legs started to thin out and I gotlarge veins. I could cover that up with clothes. My body fat was collecting on my stomach and under my chin, so I tried to eliminate all of it. Iended up not eating well and overdoing it withexercise. I began to get very tired. By about eight months, the lipo started to affect my face. At first, my face looked chiseled, butbefore long it looked emaciated. All the healthprofessionals I asked about it would shrug and say,\"Y ou have to accept it. There's nothing you can do.\"I didn't want to complain about it. I felt I shouldjust be grateful for being alive. I started going out less and less. I was supposed to go on trips to see my family, who are all acrossCanada, but I didn't go. When I did go out, Isought out places that were dark, like bars or movietheatres. I avoided having my picture taken. After about three years, I started researching solutions online. I read about an injection calledPerlane that's used for people with really deepwrinkles. My family doctor referred me to acosmetic surgeon who was really great because helet me call the shots. During the procedure, I held amirror and said: \"A little bit more here and morehere.\" Within a half-hour my sunken cheeks wereall filled out. It was a couple thousand dollars, butI'd saved up my money and had somecontributions from family members who knew thiswas important to me. The Perlane injection wasn't permanent, so I had to get a touchup after six months. Then,18 months ago, I went in for Artecoll injections,similar to Perlane but permanent. It looks amazingand natural. Y ou'd never know I had facial wasting.It's given me more confidence to get out there and live. Advice: One of the worst things about my experience with lipodystrophy was the brick walls Icame against when I tried to find a solution. Y ouhave to keep trying. It's not that health careprofessionals are wrong all the time, but sometimesyou have to find your own resources.James Madison, 46 Social worker (on disability). Diagnosed with HIV: 1995. Viral load: undetectable. CD4 count: 390. Dartmouth, Nova Scotia Marlo Cottrell ,29 Artist and furniture upholsterer Diagnosed with HIV: 1995. Viral load: 86,000. CD4 YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THAT IS VITALLYIMPORTANT because HIV leads to multiple nutrient deficiencieswhich are a cause, in turn, ofimmune dysfunction and manysymptoms. Y ou may also knowabout the high level of oxidativestress and inflammation that HIVcauses, making a high intake ofantioxidants and anti-inflammatories necessary. So, ofcourse, you spend hours every daycreating delicious meals, cookedfrom scratch, right? Maybe in aperfect world...but we know youdon't always have the time orenergy. Instead, finding ways toquickly and easily producenutrient-rich meals and snacks isan important key for boostingnutrition in our busy lives. Here are 15 ways to use the KISS (Keep It Simple, Sweetie) principlein your kitchen. Listed are foodsyou can keep on-hand\u2014becausethey're frozen, canned, jarred, driedor otherwise not going to spoil veryquickly\u2014so they're at the readywhen you're trying to boost yournutrition without lots of time andeffort. Y ou can produce an entiremeal from the followingingredients, or add one or more toany meal or snack to skyrocketnutrient content. This way you cancreate the simplest of meals andtreats: simply prepared, simplynutrient-loaded and simplyyummy.Apples, blueberries, cherries, blackberries, raspberries,strawberries, mangoes, peachesand other frozen or fresh fruit. A rainbow mixture of fruits provides a broad spectrum of potent antioxidants,anti-cancer flavonoids, natural anti-inflammatories and soluble fibre. Howdo I love fruit? Let me count the ways:in a smoothie, on top of cereal, as asnack or dessert.... How about a fruit cocktail for a change? For a simple, juicyway to pack in several servings, try theKISS Fruit Shake ( see recipe, page 7 ).Spinach, greens, carrots, broccoli, corn, squash, yams andother frozen or freshveggies. Green, orange and yellow vegetables arerich in carotenoids,including beta-caroteneand lutein, and otherimportant pigment. Keepthese and other frozenveggies on-hand for aquick side dish to any mealor to add to soups,casseroles, pasta, rice,omelettes or natural anti-inflammatories. Cannedsalmon also contains thosecrunchy bones full ofcalcium. Try to stick to wildsalmon because there iscontroversy over the safetyof farmed salmon. If youcan't get wild salmon andwant to continue receivingthe health benefits from fish,limit farmed salmon to oneserving per week. (For moreinfo about the fish debate,go to www.hc-sc.gc.ca andsearch for \"salmon.\") THE POSITIVE SIDE06Tomatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes. Fresh or canned, they're loaded with lycopeneand other very importantantioxidants. They've beenshown to reduce the risk ofheart disease and cancer(especially of the prostate,colon, stomach, intestinesand bladder) and to helpprotect lungs (from airpollution), eyes (frommacular degeneration), skin(from sun damage) thebrain (from memory loss).The lycopene is mostavailable from tomatoescooked with olive oil, so to soups, sauces,casseroles and stews, or usepre-prepared pasta saucesthat contain them both.Avocados. Research has shown that these yummy fruits are very liver protective, in partbecause they're loaded withglutathione, cherries, papayas andkiwi (grapefruit, too, but besure to check for druginteractions). Ginger root. Ginger is a natural anti- inflammatory, anti-nausea agent andbooster of HDL cholesterol. Gingerroot can be chopped to make tea, addedto sauces or soups, saut\u00e9ed with veggiesor mushrooms, or juiced to add to fruitdrinks or fresh-squeezed lemonade. Roasted red peppers and green chili peppers. Packed with vitamin C, lycopene and other antioxidantsthat boost immunity and counterheart disease and cancer. Use them insalads, sauces, pasta, casseroles, orMexican and Italian dishes.Garlic (fresh or powdered) and yellow, green or red onions. Any way you slice, chop, mince, bake, roast, crush or powder it\u2014garlic andonions, natural antifungals andantibacterials, are rich in antioxidantsand protect against cancer and heartdisease. Add to salads, soups, stews,casseroles, pasta, rice, omelettes or stir-fries.Orange, cranberry, watermelon, tangerine, cherry and other fruit juices. Loaded with vitamin C, flavonoids, carotenoids, polyphenolsand other antioxidants that can boostimmunity and protect against cancerand heart disease. Studies show that adaily glass of OJ may cut the risk ofstroke by 25%, and several glasses ofcranberry juice can raise HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (thehealthy kind). Fresh-squeezed juice isbest because numerous nutrients arepacked into the pulp. 15 food groups to pack in your pantry Eggs. The incredible edible, eggs have high-quality protein, along with lots of lutein and zeazanthin(important antioxidant nutrients found in the yolk thatprotect against cataracts and macular degeneration), aswell as significant amounts of vitamins A, B 12and D, folic acid, iron, phosphorus and riboflavin. Of great importanceto PHAs, eggs also contain the sulfur amino acids neededby the body to create glutathione. \"Enhanced\" eggs containomega-3 fatty acids. Fried, scrambled, baked, boiled,poached\u2014eggs are ready in moments.Chicken broth and canned chicken. The beginning of great soups\u2014the quickest and easiest ofmeals. Pick a broth, throw insome veggies and cannedchicken meat (or leftoverchicken), and you're on theway to a flavourful, protein-rich, nutrient-loaded meal(see recipe, page 8 ). SPRING SUMMER 2004 07PUT ONE SLICED, RIPE, MEDIUM-TO-LARGE BANANA IN BLENDER. Add frozen or fresh fruit to about the 3/4 mark. Since colour is where the nutrientsare, use a rainbow mixture of fruits . (You can buy a frozen fruit smoothie mix that will give you the mangoes, papaya, pineapple and somestrawberries. I use partly that and then add some other fruit.) Fill the blender to a bit above the level of the fruit with juice(tangerine or orange tastes great, fresh-squeezed if possible). I also add a coupletablespoons each of mango pur\u008ee , cranberry juice concentrate and/or pomegranate juice concentrate . The latter are an easy way to super-boost the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cancer protective nutrient levels ofthe shake. If you need extra calories, add coconut milk . If you need moreprotein, add a protein powder . For a really great anti- inflammatory addition, add ginger juice . (Peel ginger root, cut into medium-size pieces and juice it.) A few tablespoonsare a spicily tasty addition to help counter inflammationthroughout your body. Blend the mixture until smooth (don\u00d5t overstress the blender; you may have to pulse it at first if most fruit is frozen). Afterit\u00d5s well blended, add a few heaping tablespoons of goodplain yogurt (best is one of the unhomogenized organic varieties) and then blend a bit more. A yummy way to startyour day or a sweet mid-day snack. Dried fruit\u00d1plums (prunes), raisins,blueberries,cranberries andapricots...and somenuts and seeds, too. These dried fruits are extremely high in anti-oxidants. Mix them withwalnuts (a rich source ofanti-inflammatoryomega-3 fatty acids) andother nuts and sources have ayummy trail-mix snackpacked with importantnutrients. Or use thenuts, raw asnack or sprinkled onsalads, cooked veggiesand desserts.Whole-grain crackers, nutrients,especially fibre.Use the bread forsandwiches, the crackers as soupaccompaniments orsnacks, the pasta asthe base for a greatItalian meal, andthe rice as a soupaddition or sidedish\u2014all thesewhole foods are asource of healthfulcarbohydrates. Tea. Black or green, both are high in anti-oxidants and alkylamines,chemicals that boostimmune cells to fightinfections and cancers.The longer you brew it,the higher the antioxidantcontent. Also protectsagainst heart disease. Thecaffeine in tea is releasedmuch more slowly thancoffee's, but if it bothersyou, do decaf.Chocolate and cocoa. In an article about good nutrition?! Y ep, both chocolate and cocoa areloaded with antioxidants.Bittersweet chocolate is the mostnutrient-rich. Stick with brands likeHershey that don't include nastypartially hydrogenated (trans) fats(read labels!), or make your ownhot drink from cocoa powder. A cupof hot cocoa has an antioxidantconcentration almost two timesstronger than red wine, two to threetimes stronger than green tea, andfour to five times stronger thanblack tea. Y es, it contains sugar andfat (unless you choose skim milk),so don't overdo it, but if you'regoing to indulge in a sweet treat, atleast you can make it the mostnutrient-loaded choice. THE POSITIVE SIDE08START WITH SOME CHICKEN BROTH , preferably Imagine Organic Free Range Chicken Broth\u00d1delicious and far better than any others; (available in manysupermarkets in quart-size cardboard cartons, www.imaginefoods.com). Bring broth to a boil. Add a mixture of vegetables in every colour (the more colour the better). If they don\u00d5t cause you excessive gas problems,add some beans (lentils or pintos or whatever you like, pre-cooked or canned), for a great nutrient-, fibre- and protein-rich addition. (Taking thevegetable enzyme soups usually eliminates the gasproblem.) Don\u00d5t overdo it with the beans because they make the soup veryrich and filling, and the real goal is to eat the veggies. Fresh veggies have the highest nutrient content. But if you don\u00d5t have time to dice and slice, frozen ones make the soup production much faster and easier.From the time you throw most frozen veggies in the broth, the soup\u00d5s usuallyready in 10-12 minutes. Add some leftover chicken or a can of chicken meat, broken up into small pieces. To up the nutrient value, add a few tablespoons of virgin olive oil (organic first cold-pressed extra virgin oils are best). Season with saltand pepper . Lark Lands, a medical journalist and longtime AIDS treatment educator and advocate, was a pioneer in bringing attention to the need for a total integrated approach to HIV disease.She has written a number of articles and Practical Guides for CATIE, is a frequent speakerat AIDS conferences, and does her seminar Living Well...Not Just Longer throughout North America. For her fact sheets and treatment info summaries, go to www.larklands.net. The first time you make the soup, you may want to start with basics that most people like: chicken broth,one can of diced tomatoes, three tablespoons of oliveoil, chicken, corn, carrots, green beans, a bit of saltand pepper to taste. Then modify and try differentvarieties. Don\u00d5t overwhelm the soup with a lot of anyone thing or too many different veggies because ittends to create a muddied flavor. If you\u00d5re a vegetarian, you can start with a vegetable broth flavored with toasted sesame oil, and add somechunks of cheese to each bowl to make a creamyprotein-adding addition. Cheddar, Monterey jack or acreamy blue all melt nicely. You can top off the soup with some whole-grain crackers or nuts. I serve it with hot baked walnuts orpecans, because nuts are hugely heart-healthy and addto the protein content. I make a reasonable amount of soup and keep some in the fridge (whatever I\u00d5ll use in the next two or threedays). You can also freeze meal-sized portions. Puttingleftovers in the microwave drastically lowers nutrientvalues, so heat it up the old-fashioned way. WHAT MAKES A PERSON A LONG-TERM SURVIVOR? Is it living with HIV for 10, 15, 20 years? Is it outliving one's partner and mostcontemporaries who were diagnosed in the darkand difficult '80s? Been there, done that. I found out I had HIV in the mid-'80s, a couple years after my partner Kimble wasdiagnosed, though I know in my heart we wereboth infected during our '70s disco days. Ilimped along for about five years with no CD4cells, not even one I could name. My CD8 count,however, was awesome and may in fact have keptme going. But Kimble, like so many people backthen, was unable to hang on. In 1991, my partnerof 15 years died of a CMV-related infection. I started taking AZT [Retrovir] when it appeared in 1987 and added ddI [Videx] andother nukes as they became available. Still, I waswasting. I was on what would now be consideredsub-optimal therapy until late 1996, when Iadded a protease inhibitor. I'd already madesome major changes to my lifestyle\u2014stoppedsmoking, started to exercise and began exploringcomplementary and alternative therapies,particularly nutritional supplementation andtraditional Chinese medicine. I also got involvedin HIV community activism. I don't doubt thatthese changes, along with my meds, are part ofthe reason I'm still here today. Even so, how I ended up almost 20 years later feeling as well as I do and with stable counts\u2014playing the roles of both witness and survivor\u2014is still mostly a mystery to me. It may be partgenetic and it may be part luck, but sometimes I think it's just pure pluck. 1 2 3From the trenches, here are my Top 5 Tips for Stayin\u00d5 Alive: SPRING SUMMER 2004 09IT\u00d5S NOT WHAT YOU KNOW, IT\u00d5S WHAT YOU KNOW TO ASK. The science around HIV has come a long way in the past 20 years, but because of its rapid evolution it can beoverwhelming. Even I find myself drowning in it, and I'vebeen following it for ages. T o keep your head above water:Find a doctor you can work with and don't be afraid to askquestions. If you decide to start highly active antiretroviraltherapy (HAART), the most basic questions to ask are: Whatare the side effects? How potent or effective is the regimen,and how do I make it last? How does it fit my lifestyle? BE OUT IN FRONT BUT NOT FIRST. In 1995 I was in a drug trial and all I got was the placebo. Not even a lousy T-shirt! I really could have used that protease inhibitor, so itwas no fun being a guinea pig. While I'm thankful that wenow have about 20 antiretrovirals available, I recommend, ifpossible, taking drugs that have been around awhile becausethere's more long-term safety data. Once you find a regimenyou can tolerate, stick to it to the best of your ability. LOVE EVERYTHING YOU PUT IN YOUR MOUTH. And I mean everything \u2014food, vitamins, herbs, hormones, antiretrovirals and, yes, significant others! There's no point intaking anything you don't believe is essentially good for you.If you think drugs are toxic, they probably will be. Instead,visualize those nukes clobbering the virus and bathing eachand every CD4 cell in rays of golden light. If you're not eatingproperly, consider supplements, but remember that \"natural\"doesn't mean harmless. Learn about interactions betweennatural health products and meds. As for recreational drugs,better living through chemistry does not apply if you intendto be here for the long run. My motto has become:\"Moderation in all things, including excess.\" Ron Rosenes, 20 years with HIV, on what keeps him alive and kicking THE POSITIVE SIDE10Ron Rosenes, former chair of the AIDS Committee of Toronto, is presently stayin\u00d5 alive on several boards:the Canadian Treatment Action Council (CTAC), theToronto 2006 International AIDS Conference, theSherbourne Health Centre, and AIDS ACTION NOW!He\u00d5s an enthusiastic devotee of ashtanga yoga.Keep on Truckin\u00d5Four survivors on their long, strange trips with HIV 54MAINTAIN ALL FLUID LEVELS.

That being said, sugar ain't so sweet: With diabetes so common inthe general population and insulinresistance increasing among HAARTusers, cutting down on refinedcarbohydrates makes sense. Like your mother said, eat your fruits and veggies. FEED YOUR BODY AND YOUR MIND. We are more than our virus. Many Eastern cultures view us as thesum total of our energy.

Fran\u008doise Groth\u008e ,59 RETIRED TEACHER AND SOCIAL WORKER. DIAGNOSIS: 1990 (LIKELY INFECTED AROUND1985). VIRAL LOAD: UNDETECTABLE. CD4COUNT: 700. MONTREAL, QUEBEC Ilived for 10 years in the Caribbean, where I got infected. For a month after my diagnosis, Iwaited to die. I paid for my funeral,even got a little urn to be buried in.When that didn't happen, I said, \"T ohell with it. I'm living and that's it.\" For about 14 years I didn't take any HIV drugs. Each day I walked 3 kilometres, swam in the ocean, slept eight to 10 hours, and ate fresh fish and coconuts\u2014a perfect lifeas far as my health was concerned. I came back to Montreal every year to see my daughter and my doctor. In 1998 my doctor said, \"Y our CD4 count is 20, you have tocome back.\" So I said goodbye to my friends in the Caribbean, manyof whom had AIDS. I had to look at them, knowing damn well theywere going to die and I possibly wasn't. When I came back to Canada, my doctor signed my disability papers. Under prognosis was the word death . That's when it hit me. Soon after, I started antiretrovirals and got really sick. When you're not feeling sick and you start meds, you ask yourself, \"Why the hellam I doing this?\" I was taking ddI [Videx] and ended up almostgetting pancreatitis. When they finally took me off the meds, I wasthrowing up 24 hours a day. Eight months later, they put me onsomething else, which lasted four months. I ended up in the hospitalwith acute anemia. Then they put me what I'm taking now\u20143TC[Epivir], nevirapine [Viramune] and abacavir [Ziagen]. It's almostbeen two years and it's going really well. I have lipodystrophy andcramps in my feet and all kinds of little things, but it's nothing big.Last year I had a bout with osteoporosis\u2014there was a period of aboutsix months where you'd just look at me and I'd break a bone\u2014butthat's better now. I'm lucky that I can do the things I love, like going to the library and the movies. I live with my daughter and her half sister. Mydaughter is bubbly and crazier than I am, but she's also a big worrier,which has forced me to not feel sorry for myself. If it's 5 p.m. and I've had a lousy day,I don't want to depress the girls when theyget home. When you try to be in a goodhumour for someone else, you realize you are in a good humour. My daughter was diagnosed last year with a rare form ofrheumatoid arthritis. The big joke betweenus now is: \"Y ou're supposed to take care ofme and I'm taking care of you.\" I've becomethe caregiver again. I do a lot of volunteer AIDS work. If I have this possibility of living, I have to dosomething with it. We lost a lot of activistslast year in Canada. Many of them weregiving lectures two to three days before theydied. That motivates me. It hurts yourfeelings to see them die and, like it or not,you know you've got the same thing and yourturn is going to come. One thing that keeps me going is a very controlled and well-channeled anger. I'm stillangry, and I'm going to be angry until I die.I'm angry against this illness\u2014not that I haveit, but that it exists and it's so stupid andthere's no reason for it. In 2005, it's going to be 20 years that I've had this disease. I'd say at least 50 percent, ifnot more, of the reason for my survival isattitude. I've always been in love with life. SURVIVAL TIPS Eat well, sleep well and learn\u00d1when it comes to HIV, you are your own doctor.You have to be able to analyze how youfeel. Also, forget about it. Put it asidein a little box somewhere and keep onliving your life as best you can. Life hasgiven you this, it\u00d5s a blow, but climbover it and move on to something else. SPRING SUMMER 2004 11Devan Nambiar ,43 TREATMENT INFORMATION SERVICE 50. CD4 consider myself a victim. I didn't know that the guy I was dating was positive. I wasvolunteering with the AIDSCommittee of T oronto, I had allthe knowledge...but I chose not toact on it. At the time, we didn'tknow a lot about transmission. Wethought if we did it a certain way,it would be fine. I didn't have sexfor two years after testing positive,I was so traumatized. I thoughtmaybe it would go away if I'mcelibate. I traveled to India, where my parents come from, and started tolook at who I was. I picked up books on spiritualism, Hinduism andIndian traditional medicine. I ended my trip in Malaysia, where myfamily lives. It was a very introspective, personal journey. When I returned to T oronto in June 1989, I went for a second HIV test just to make sure. It came back positive. I continued to learn moreabout the immune system and mind-body modalities. My focus wason nutrition, vitamin therapy, yoga, meditation and exercise. My goalwas to work out, eat right, sleep right. In 1991, I got into an amazing relationship with an HIV positive man. The next year we went to Asia. When we returned he got reallysick. I had no experience with somebody who's dying, especiallysomeone I was attached to. There's nothing you can do except bethere. Y ou're completely, utterly powerless. It's the worst lesson youcan learn in life. He passed away in January 1993. In 1995 I started my work in AIDS, though part of me wasn't resolved about my boyfriend's death and my own mortality. I waseating and sleeping right, but I wasn't thinking very positive. In 1996,I had 50 CD4 cells and I became really ill with PCP . It was the mostexcruciating and humbling experience. I had to sit up while sleepingbecause I couldn't breathe and there was the most horrible smell About seven years ago, some friends on a gay hockey teamrecruited me. I was 42 andinitially said, \"No, I'm too old.\"It's turned out to be one of thebest things I've done. There areother positive men on the team.One longtime PHA has been areal role model to me. I look atthe game as an analogy for life:A lot of times you're knockeddown on your ass, but you getup right away, you don't havetime to think. It's very \"in themoment.\" I realized at one point that I couldn't live like a purist. Ismoke pot regularly and enjoylife with gusto\u2014good food,good wine\u2014but I have my ownkind of balance with it. Therewas a time when I forced myselfto go to the pool and swimlengths, but now I just do thingsthat are fun, like rollerblading.I'm thinking more about thefuture and how to findchallenging, rewarding work.AIDS is in the background. Death is sitting on everyone's shoulder. I'm not different fromanyone else, with or withoutHIV . How long am I going tolive and what's the future goingto look like? I'm not worriedabout it. The length of life isn'tall that important\u2014it's what the quality of that life is like that counts. continued on page 19 > THE POSITIVE SIDE12coming from my breath, from my lungs. I called my doctor, who told me to get toER right away. The hospital staff said:\"What were you waiting for? If you cameone day later, you'd be dead.\" I joked:\"Damn, I should have waited.\" Two months later my doctor asked if I was ready to start meds. I went onindinavir [Crixivan], 3TC [Epivir] andAZT gave mehyper-pigmentation skin. After ninemonths, I went on a three-month drugholiday\u2014my first of many. I may havebeen the first person to ever take a drugholiday! It was a big no-no at the time. After that, I went on efavirenz [Sustiva], ddI [Videx] and d4T [Zerit] were killing me: I couldn't walk orbike to work anymore. So I did someresearch and decided to drop the \"d\" drugs.I kept the Sustiva and went back to AZT and 3TC. I boosted my B 12injections, and did acupuncture and foot massage, and myfeet got better. I stayed on that regimenuntil 2001, when I took a prolongedtreatment break. I'm on five meds now, the most I've taken. I'm feeling fine. My lifestyle is verydisciplined: I go to the gym at 6 a.m. fourdays a week, I eat well and take manysupplements. I have a boyfriend who'snegative and cool with my status. I'vefinished writing a book and I initiated adrug-recycling program in South India. I'm no longer looking for answers in my life. I think I've found what I'm looking for.I know I have a place in the universe andHIV is one of the pieces in my life, not allof it. I'm finally at peace with HIV . It'sdoing its thing, I'm doing my thing\u2014wecan live together. SURVIVAL TIPS: Listen to your heart. Live and enjoy life. Do the research, learn what thedisease is about. Combine the bodyand the mind. People doing just oneor the other are missing a lot interms of the full picture. James Oakes ,48 COMMUNICATIONS AND MARKETING, LANGARA COLLEGE. DIAGNOSIS: 1984. VIRAL LOAD: 16,500.CD4 COUNT: 340. VANCOUVER, BC Idon't really consider that I have a disease. I know I'm HIV positive, but I've never had symptoms or takenHIV meds, so it's something of anabstraction for me. When I wasdiagnosed, I didn't buy into the deathsentence, even though the climate of themid-'80s was a time of real terror. Initially, I remember feeling ambivalent about life and death. But atthe same time, I had a strong will to live and the thought of dyingwas inconceivable. I'd been doing a lot of psychotherapy. At the timeof my diagnosis, I was doing bioenergic therapy, which allows you togo really deep into all the fears and vocalize it and feel it in the body.I was confronting all the emotional issues on my plate, so when I wasdiagnosed I was torn between living and dying. This ambivalencewracked me for quite a while. Therapy allowed me to go through the fear. I realized that you could literally be scared to death. People who tested positive werebuying into the death sentence. Symptoms would manifestthemselves, leading into a downward spiral. At a certain point, thewill to live is lost. It took me a long time to realize this; it was a very long journey. On the way home from my doctor's office, the road bisected acemetery, and I felt like I was riding through the valley of death.Although I was essentially an atheist, I found solace in the Catholicpresence in Quebec. I found myself going into churches, which wasradical for me. The image of Jesus on the cross touched me. At the time, I was suffering from digestive problems. I thought I was dying of AIDS. Eventually I learned that it was irritable bowelsyndrome, a very debilitating condition. I had to learn to separatethe two illnesses. About two years after my HIV diagnosis, things fell apart. I had a lot of professional and personal stress. My relationship came to a badend, mostly because of my girlfriend's fears around AIDS. I asked mypsychotherapist for a letter requesting a leave from my job and flewout to the West coast, where I'm from. I took refuge with a friendwho lived in a big house near Squamish. It was a safe place for me. Iworked in the overgrown fields of his house and I'd take his dogs upthe mountain-logging roads for hours. I felt my salvation lay inphysical work, to defy death through my physical strength. I decidedto quit my job and give up the life I'd built in Quebec. I pretty much shelved my career, spending my days in the garden and going swimming. But eventually I realized: \"I'm not dying, sowhat am I going to do?\" I began taking freelance journalismassignments and moved to Vancouver. For the past decade I've justcarried on, with the help of antidepressants. Photograph by Scott Dixon SURVIVAL TIPS: Surviving is about following your intuition and living lifewith enthusiasm. Find yourpassions. It\u00d5s very importantto have support in your life.Find a good counsellor ortherapist with whom you cango into the darkest, scariestpart of it all and confront your fears.Maggie McGinn ,47 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LIVING POSITIVE. DIAGNOSIS: 1992. VIRAL LOAD: UNDETECTABLE. CD4 COUNT: 510. EDMONTON, ALBERTA In 1992 I was in a hospital psych program, Monday to Friday, 9 to 5, and going to AA in the evenings. For the first six weeks, we didmeditation; for the next six weeks, aerobics.I didn't want to do aerobics, and I was told Imight be able to get out of it if I got a medical. When I went for my results, the doctor handed me a piece of paper saying I was reactive to two different tests. I had no clue what it meant.But then I looked at his face and I knew. He didn't know where to referme, so he got another patient's file. When he opened it, I saw \"HIVpositive\" in big magic marker. That's when I freaked out. The next day in my program we did a group session with about 40 people. They could see I was just vibrating away. This girl asked, \"What'swrong with her?\" I said, \"I found out last night I've got HIV .\" Nobodysaid a word except that girl, she gasped. When I was diagnosed, a nurse at the hospital told me people usually had about four years to live from the time she first saw them. She meantpeople who'd already been hospitalized, but I thought, \"I've got fouryears, I'd better live quick.\" I did all the things I thought I should do. One nurse told me about toxoplasmosis, so I got rid of my cat. It was so traumatic: I took him tothe SPCA with my kids crying. After that, I got a letter from my brotherPatrick. He'd found out there were only six cases of toxo in the whole ofthe U.S. that year. \"T ee-hee, too bad you killed your cat,\" he wrote. Hewas trying to say: Don't listen to everything every nurse tells you. I was in the midst of huge change. I'd been married and divorced three times. I'd buried two kids and had two girls. My oldest daughterhad a mental disability. I'd never really dealt with anything, I just stayeddrunk. But now I was in this psych program and going to AA meetingsreligiously. If it weren't for that, I don't know if I'd be here now. Not long after my diagnosis, I went to a support group at Living Positive. I walked into the room and there were 12 gay men, in alldifferent stages. I was a bit freaked out, but it ended up being good forme. One day I realized it was like a competition\u2014who's had HIV thelongest, who's been hospitalized the most, who's got the lowest CD4count, who's got the most medication. They were wearing it like a badgeof honour. I refused to let the illness be who I am. People would come inand say: \"Hi, I'm HIV positive.\" And I'd say: \"I'm Maggie. I'm a mother,I'm a bitch, whatever. I have an illness, but that's not who I am.\" That summer Health Canada was running a demonstration project in Edmonton and they brought me in as a volunteer. After doing peercounselling training at Living Positive, Health Canada hired me part-time. When the Canadian AIDS Society started the Canadian Women andHIV Project in 1995, they hired me, and I've worked in AIDS ever since. SPRING SUMMER 2004 13THE POSITIVE SIDE14 SPRING SUMMER 2004 15This dimension of movement represents the universal cycles of life\u2014the changing of the seasons,the movement of the stars, the stages of life (fromconception to death). For 12,000 years, AboriginalPeople refined their sciences and oral traditions,which helped them create a unique world view.Their teachings describe the relationships peoplehad with other living worlds and the dimensionsaround them. Over the past few decades, with more Aboriginal People opening doors in educational and scientificinstitutions, the value of this ancient knowledge isbeginning to be revived and reintegrated into theAboriginal way of doing things. For example, in 1984the Four Worlds Development Project at theUniversity of Lethbridge published The Sacred Tree . This book, which teaches about the Medicine Wheel,gathered life lessons from many Elders and Aboriginalcultures with the purpose of creating a culturallycompetent model to deal with alcohol addiction. Two important Aboriginal values\u2014 efficiency and portability \u2014are key to understanding the Medicine Wheel. The circle is the centre, the place where thefour cardinal (of primary importance) directionsmeet\u2014East, South, West and North. For mostpeople, it's important to know where they stand,where they came from, and where they're going.The Wheel concept serves as a multidimensionalpersonal roadmap that can be carried in one's mindand actions. The symbols and directions are codesand pathways which are easily followed once oneunderstands their meaning. The \"medicine\" inherentin the Wheel exists on many planes, and as long asthe relationships between all forces are maintainedin a balanced and positive way, the medicine willflow, providing vision, strength and healing. Thisconcentrated way of holding and sharing knowledge(similar to a modern CD-ROM) is crucial becauseprior to European contact, Aboriginal groupsTHE HIV/AIDS MEDICINE WHEEL IN THE AMERICAS, ABORIGINAL PEOPLE HA VE HIGHER RATES OF POOR HEALTH THAN THE GENERALPOPULATION. There are epidemics of heart disease, diabetes,addiction, depression and other preventable illnesses due to theloss of traditional lands and the restrictive policies of successivegovernments. HIV infection is also rising at an alarming rate.According to Health Canada, Aboriginal People now make up14.1% of AIDS cases in Canada, even though they compriseonly 4% of the general population. The virus is increasinglyreaching Aboriginal women, with injection drug use andheterosexual sex as the major modes of transmission. The AIDSepidemic is an unprecedented crisis that poses a serious threatto current and future generations. This article describes one of the innovative HIV/AIDS education toolsdeveloped to reach the Aboriginalcommunity. The \"HIV/AIDS Wheel\" wasfirst introduced to the Canadian AIDSmovement in 1993 by Healing Our SpiritBC First Nations AIDS Prevention Society(HOS). Leonard Johnston and FrederickHaineault, both HIV positive, co-foundedHOS in 1992 as a way to educateAboriginal People about the importance ofresponding to the growing epidemic. While on a healing journey at his home in Alberta, Johnston had the vision ofadapting the traditional Medicine Wheel concept to the stages of HIV disease. He essentially merged theclinical, social and cultural aspects of HIV into a life-generatingpath, moving away from the \"AIDS = death\" messages of theprevious decade to promote a holistic understanding of thedisease. The Wheel concept can help all people with HIV/AIDS(PHAs) better understand where they're at with the infection sothey can make choices that might improve their lives. The Medicine Wheel can be thought of as an \"Aboriginal teaching circle.\" It's called a wheel because it revolves endlessly.traveled great distances, making it difficult to carry more than what was considered essential. With even greater mobility today,it still continues to be important for Aboriginal People to \"carry\"their medicine in this practical way. The Medicine Wheel teaches us that we're all part of a family and community and it's our obligation to plan for the future sothe decisions we make don't negatively affect the people sevengenerations from now. (For more info, see \"Introduction to theMedicine Wheel Concept\" at www3.bc.sympatico.ca/kakakaway/wheel0.htm.) Developed at a time when AZT was the only available treatment option, Johnston's HIV/AIDS Wheel follows the flow of theMedicine Wheel, incorporating the medical knowledge of HIVdisease into a cycle of life stages and states of being. Theseelements speak to the inter-connected relationships and forceswithin our environment. Johnston shared his observations of the full cycle and impact of thedisease because he could see the larger picture itpresented. He saw young men forced to deal withtheir diagnoses and impending deaths without thesupport of their families and communities. He feltthat the discrimination and isolation theyexperienced could be overcome if the communityknew more about the stages of the disease andwhat they needed. The HIV/AIDS Wheel provides a reminder and opportunity for health care professionals, PHAs,their family members and others to recognize theemotional, spiritual and social aspects thatinfluence and are influenced by this disease.Emotional and spiritual factors can greatly affectone's ability to cope with the disease. \u00d2As Aboriginal People,we always have achoice. We can choseto do things our way,the way of the People,or we can chose to dothings in a way that\u00d5sas foreign to us as ahot dog would havebeen to Sitting Bull.\u00d3 \u00d1Quinn Wade, APHA activist Source: Healing Our Spirit BC First Nations AIDS Prevention Society 1993THE POSITIVE SIDE16The following text explains the details of the HIV/AIDS Wheel. It was written down for the firsttime in 1997, when Manitoba Health printed the\"HIV/AIDS T eaching Kit\" resource manual. Upuntil then, the HIV/AIDS Wheel teachings weretaught through the oral tradition. CHILD S TAGE Clinical: The \"window period\" begins immediately after a person is infected with HIV and can last forthree to six months. During this time, it's difficultto detect HIV with an antibody blood test becausethe immune system may not yet have producedenough antibodies to yield a positive test result. Colour: Red represents blood, the source of life and the target of HIV . Direction: East represents the place where all things begin, as in the rising of the sun each day.Here, HIV enters into the cycle of a person's lifeexperience. Phase: The \"physical\" phase represents the invasion of HIV into the blood system(seroconversion) and the body's response. YOUTH S TAGE Clinical: An HIV positive person has no symptoms of HIV infection. This stage can last up to 10 ormore years. Colour: Black represents darkness. Negativity, fear, shame and anger are common reactions to an HIVdiagnosis. Direction: South represents learning and exploration. Phase: The \"emotional\" phase relates to how a person may feel in dealing with their diagnosis.The person may experience a rollercoaster ride ofemotions as they cope with issues ofconfidentiality, disclosure and counselling. ADUL T STAGE Clinical: A person begins to show symptoms of HIV disease. Colour: White represents light, balancing the \"darker\" aspects of living with HIV/AIDS. It alsorepresents hope, knowledge and acceptance of anHIV diagnosis. Direction: West represents knowledge and growth. Phase: The \"mental\" phase is a time when a person will make important decisions abouttreatment, disclosure, living wills, work and other considerations.ELDER S TAGE Clinical: AIDS is a medical term that defines the end stage of HIVdisease. The immune system can nolonger fight infections and diseases,eventually resulting in death. Colour: Y ellow represents the sun, the giver of life. Direction: North represents healing, acceptance and closure. Phase: The \"spiritual\" phase is a time when a person with AIDS isconfronted by the nearness of death.As the physical body weakens, theneed for spirituality may growstronger. As death approaches, thismay be a time of healing withfamily, resolving old issues andfinding closure. A person may go through these stages in a different order or evenrepeatedly (such as PHAs who wereon the brink of death but then gottheir health back when proteaseinhibitors came out), but it's been my experience through havingmany friends who've lived with and died from HIV disease thatthey do travel on the journey of the Wheel. An important teachingto consider is that we are all on this life cycle and we'll alleventually go along the same path. People with HIV may gosooner, but the point is: \" Life is about how you live every day\u2014not about how long you live .\" The HIV/AIDS Wheel was Johnston's vision of how to explain HIV/AIDS to Aboriginal People, who were cautious of strangerscoming into their communities. The value of the Wheel is that it'sbrought us to the second generation, or wave, of the epidemic. Aswe've come full circle and now move from the Elder to Childstages, we see that there's another generation at risk\u2014orphans wholost their parents to AIDS, gay youth, and children of HIV positiveparents\u2014that faces an uncertain future in this country. Some arenow teenagers, and may be homeless, in jail or on the streetinjecting drugs. So, as the Wheel turns, do we find that we have the foresight and spirit to plan for seven generations into the future? It willdepend on how much good medicine we've absorbed and how ithas healed us. For me, this time it is the teachings of advocacy , compassion and harm reduction that sit in the Eastern Doorway, waiting to be asked in. Albert McLeod has worked in the Aboriginal AIDS movement since 1986. He participated in the creation of the Nine Circles Community Health Centre model.He\u00d5s also an artist who lives in Ottawa and teaches Two-Spirit youth abouttraditional arts and their Two-Spirit culture.

Infection occurs when the bacteria found in syphilis lesions penetrate amucous membrane (anus, vagina,penis head, mouth) or a cut in the skinanywhere on the body. The lesions canbe very discrete or not visible at all. Syphilis is spread during sexual activities: oral sex (mainly mouth- penis and also, possibly, mouth-vulvaor mouth-anus), penetration (penis-vagina or penis-anus) and, rarely,frottage (rubbing against each other'snaked skin). A pregnant woman can spread syphilis to her unborn baby, which cancause severe birth defects. In rare cases,syphilis can be spread if contaminatedmaterials are used to inject drugs. Syphilis is infectious (able to be passed from one person to another) in thefirst year to two years after infection,unless successfully treated. At somepoint, it goes into a dormant, or non-infectious, state and is no longer ableto be transmitted. The bacteria thatcause syphilis can be transmitted evenif the infected person has no apparentsymptoms.SIGNS AND S YMPT OMS OF S YPHILIS Not all people with syphilis develop symptoms. Syphilis evolves in 3 stages: Stage 1 (or \u00d2primary\u00d3 syphilis): One or more lesions (usually painless) appear at the spot where the bacteria entered the body. At first, pimples appear andevolve into ulcers (large lesions causing the loss of the surface layer of the skinor mucous membrane). These ulcers are called syphilitic sores, or chancres.Lesions appear between 9 and 90 days after having sex with an infected partner.In most cases, the lesions are on the penis or vulva, and inside the mouth,vagina or anus. Lesions inside the vagina or anus can easily go unnoticed. Thesechancres last for 1 to 5 weeks and heal on their own, but the bacteria remain inthe body. Y ou are especially infectious when you have a chancre. T o help you distinguish between syphilis and other common STDs: Syphilis sores aren't usually sensitive (lesions in the mouth, anus or vagina wouldn'tnecessarily prevent a person from having sex because of pain) as herpes sorestend to be.

In Canada, rates of contagious-stage syphilis tripledbetween 1996 and 2002. Here\u00d5s a look at syphilis in urban centres across thecountry: Montreal: 11 cases declared in 2001, 37 cases in 2002 and 103 in 2003; up to90% of cases occurred in MSM. Ottawa: 8 cases declared in 2001 and 16 cases in 2002; 75% of all cases occurredin MSM. Toronto: 30 cases declared in 2001, 179 cases in 2002, 243 in 2003; the majorityof cases occurred in men, 91% of whomhad sex with other men. Vancouver: 127 cases declared in 1999, 186 cases in 2002 and an estimated 250cases in 2003. Those primarily affected areinjection drug users and sex trade workers;during recent months, the outbreak haspicked up speed among MSM. Winnipeg: In early 2003, an outbreak of 15 cases of infectious primary andsecondary syphilis occurred in 8 womenand 7 heterosexual men aged 30 to 60.Two cases and two of the sexual partnerswere linked to the sex trade. In most of these outbreaks, 40% or more of MSM with syphilis were also infected with HIV. (Source: Recent abstracts and communiqu\u008es from the public health authorities of the cities and countries concerned.)Stage 2 (or \u00d2secondary\u00d3 syphilis): Flu-like symptoms (fatigue, fever, swollen glands, muscle and joint pain) may appear anywhere from 6 weeks to 6 months after the initial infection. An outbreak of rashes may appear on the palms of hands, soles of feet or elsewhere on the body. When the rash is present, you are highly infectious. These symptoms may last from 2 to 6 weeks. As in stage 1, they may disappear on their own, but the bacteriacontinue to evolve inside the body. Note: After stage 2 and before stage 3, syphilis goes \"latent.\" During this time, the amount of syphilis in the blood often drops, but the syphilis stillremains in your system. Though you're generally not infectious at this point,you are at risk for the organ damage that can occur in stage 3. Stage 3 (or \u00d2tertiary\u00d3 syphilis): If left untreated for years, syphilis can cause serious damage to the heart, brain, bones or skin. It can cause blindness and even death. SYPHILIS AND HIV In some people with HIV/AIDS (PHAs), syphilis can advanceto stages 2 and 3 more rapidly and can be more difficult totreat than in HIV negative people. PHAs, especially those with lower CD4 counts, may need more intense treatment to successfully get rid of syphilis.They also need more rigorous follow-up, as the risk fortreatment failure is greater among PHAs than HIV negativepeople. PHAs who may have had syphilis for a longer period of time, and/or have a poor treatment response, and/or have very few CD4 cells should have aspinal tap to rule out neurosyphilis (syphilis in the central nervous system).If the test is positive, IV (intravenous) antibiotics are required to successfullyget rid of syphilis. GETTIN G TES TED Testing for syphilis requires a blood test. However, it can take 6 to 12 weeks after the initial infection before a positive result can be obtained. The testmust therefore be repeated eventually. Sometimes a sample can be taken fromthe chancre itself, if present, and examined under a microscope. In somecases, a spinal tap must be performed in order to check for damage to thenervous system. Screening is recommended for: partners with a known case of syphilis, men who have sex with men, injection drug users, sex trade workers and theirclients/partners, pregnant women who may have been exposed, those withsexual contacts in or partners from endemic areas. People who have multiplesex partners should be tested every 3 to 6 months. GETTIN G TREA TED Syphilis is treated with antibiotics, usually high-dose penicillin given by IM (inter-muscular) injection. People with advanced syphilis may require IVtreatment. The duration of the treatment varies according to the stage of thedisease. Penicillin usually doesn't interfere with anti-HIV drugs and is welltolerated most of the time. Other antibiotics are available for people allergicto penicillin. Once treatment is complete, the person's blood is monitored toensure that it worked.Gilles Lambert is a medical officer with the Montreal Public Health Department.

I've neverbeen fat and I've never exercised inmy life. In the beginning I panickedand gave up smoking, but I've sincestarted again. People ask me: \"Howdo you stay so well?\" I don't know. Iwork, I run after my kids. HIV isn'tthe first thing I think of when I getup in the morning. I don't use it asan excuse\u2014that, to me, is giving itpower, and I refuse to do that. Iwork with PHAs, and HIV happensto be the common denominator,but we all have different lives. I was never against taking meds, I just thought I'd take them when Ineeded them. My CD4 count wasaround 1,200 for years. The firstdrop was about a year ago, to about300. My viral load has always beenaround 120,000, but it spiraled upto 500,000. This health crisis wasdirectly a result of a very stressfuland unhealthy job situation, so Ilook a leave. Last June I startedSustiva [efavirenz] and Combivir[3TC + AZT], and it's been great.I've had no side effects. AIDS came to me like a slap upside the head.

Sexual partners must also be tested and treated. If the disease is in stage 1, sex partners from the three months before the onset of symptoms should benotified; if in stage 2, sex partners from the previous six to12 months should be informed; in the case of stage 3syphilis, only certain long-term partners need to be told.It's helpful to discuss with a health care professional whichspecific partners should be notified and how it'll be done. It can be difficult to tell your sex partners. In most of Canada, a public health STD team is available to help youwith notifying your partners. HOW TO BE S YPHILIS-FREE Syphilis can be prevented by: yusing a condom for all sexual activities (including oral sex). Condoms don't offer complete protection because a syphilis lesion may be in an area not covered by the condom (like at the base of the penis). yreducing the number of sexual partners ynot sharing injection equipment yhaving regular screening tests (including testing early in pregnancy to prevent congenital syphilis in infants) ytreating people early in the course of the infection yensuring that partners of infected individuals are notified, tested and treated.It is possible to contractsyphilismore thanonce. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD REHABILITATION ? For most people, the word is often associated with prison or drug and alcohol issues. Guess again. In its broadest sense,rehabilitation means optimizing a person's choices to participate in active living through a range of services, programs and policies. Rehabilitation can be about going back to work, getting to the gym,making your own meals or increasing your ability to manage side effects and tolerate treatments. Forsome people, rehabilitation may simply be the key to keeping things from getting any worse. The goals of rehabilitation include: yimproving overall health yimproving quality of life yassisting people to be their physical, mental andspiritual best\u2014at work, home and play yincreasing independence and self-sufficiency yenhancing self-esteem Rehabilitation is most effective when it includes a holistic approach to health care , which means treating the person as a whole\u2014mind, body andspirit. It acknowledges that HIV has more than aphysical impact and that one's spiritual, emotional,social and mental well-being must also be considered. Secondly, rehabilitation involves an interdisciplinary approach . This means drawing on a range of people, services and expertise, such as someof the people listed in the \"Who's Who\" (next page),and perhaps also one's family and friends.Interdisciplinary, as opposed to multidisciplinary,implies that not only are there many people workingto improve your quality of life but that they'reworking in a coordinated fashion, communicatingwith each other for the best results possible. Finally, and most importantly, rehabilitation has a client-centred philosophy that puts the person living with HIV/AIDS (PHA) in the driver's seat.

Chiropractic is a method of care in which the spine, pelvis and other articulating joints are manipulated to restore mobility, ease pain andstimulate the body's own balancing of function. Massage Therapists use techniques designed to promote circulation, enhance lymphatic flow and ease musculoskeletal pain. Massage can often aid inrespiration, allay symptoms of abdominal cramping and nausea, and, above all, provide a relaxed sense ofwell-being. Naturopaths see disease as an attempt by one's body to rid itself of toxins and restore balance. They use productsand procedures to boost the body's natural healingpowers. The patient plays an active role in stayinghealthy. Naturopaths use a holistic approach to healingwhich can include herbs, nutrition, supplementation,homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine.Illustration by Edward SchnurrWhen talking about rehabilitation, the word disability naturally comes up. According to the World HealthOrganization, disability breaks down into to several layers: yimpairment: any problem in body function or structure (such as pain, weakness, decreased range of motion) yactivity limitation: any difficulty in carrying out a task or action (such as difficulty walking, bathing, getting dressed) yparticipation restriction: any problem in involvement in life situations (such as difficulty maintaining employment,education, social life) These concepts may help you understand the various levels or ways in which HIV can affect a person. They may also beuseful when you\u00d5re seeking a referral from a doctor or fillingout forms and you need to describe how HIV affects you. REHABcommon theme for a number of other disability groups. Finding what PHAs have in common with other groups means a stronger voice when lobbying for change. THE WHO\u00d5S WHO OF REHAB Some of the professionals under the rehab banner include: Physical Therapists test and measure people's strength, range of motion, balance and coordination, posture, muscle performance, respiration and motor function. They provide services that help restore function, improve mobility, relieve pain and prevent or limit permanent physical disabilities. Occupational Therapists help people increase their ability to perform daily tasks at home and work. They help people improve basic motor functions and reasoning abilities and compensate for loss of function. Physiatrists are physicians who specialize in physical medicine and rehabilitation. Speech Language Pathologists treat a wide range of speech, language and swallowing disorders. Vocational and Rehabilitation Counsellors assist people with physical, mental or emotional disabilities to plan careers, deal with societal and personal problems relatingto their disabilities, and find and keep satisfying jobs. Recreation Therapists assist people to achieve an independent and rewarding leisure lifestyle in order toimprove health and well-being. Human Resource Professionals help determine workplace policy that supports people to stay in the workplace, negotiatebenefits and insurance policies, and assist with retrainingprograms for people who need to work differently. There are also many natural health practitioners whose services can be of great help, including:Rehabilitation can put you back in the driver\u00d5s seat Unlike someone who may be long-term or permanently disabledby a car accident, many PHAs experiencealternating periods of illness and wellness. This isreferred to as an episodic condition . For many people HIV is an unpredictable roller-coaster ride. Even when a person'sfeeling fine and their counts are stable, the knowledge that theroller-coaster might take an unexpected dive at any momenthas an impact. This is a common concern among PHAs whenit comes to back-to-work or other employment issues. Private insurance companies and Canada Pension Plan can make it very risky, if not impossible, for PHAs on disabilityinsurance to re-enter the work force or even volunteer theirtime in some cases. Education and policy change are neededto create more effective and flexible insurance plans, andunderstanding the concept and impact of an episodiccondition is essential to this.

She\u00d5d like to assure positive smokers who are consideringbutting out that the benefits are well worth the effort. THE POSITIVE SIDE22GET IT UP For many smokers, there's nothing like lighting up after making love. But here's something not so sexy aboutsmoking: Men who smoke often have weaker erections.Smoking contributes to the accumulation of fatty depositsin the arteries and veins, which can reduce blood flow to thepenis. Also, the build-up of nicotine in the tissue of thepenis may make it difficult to keep an erection. BE GOOD T O YOUR BONE Many antiretrovirals cause osteopenia (bone loss) and osteoporosis (severe bone loss),which can lead to fractures and broken bones. Smokers tendto have lower bone mass. Y ou do the math. HAVING A B ABYSmoking during pregnancy increases the possibility of transmitting HIV to your baby, according toresearchers in Philadelphia. Nicotine and other chemicals incigarettes can rupture the membranes surrounding thebaby, increasing its exposure to blood and other secretions.Babies born to moms who puff often have such problems aslow birth weight, asthma, chronic ear infections, learningdisabilities and behavioural problems. BLOWING SMOKE Smokers expose everyone around them to the 4,000 chemicals packed into their butts, including 50cancer-causing substances such as arsenic, ammonia,carbon monoxide, cyanide, lead, mercury and nicotine.Second-hand smoke from the burning end of a cigarette ishighly concentrated with these toxicities. REACH OUT Because smoking is such a powerful addiction, quitting isn't always easy. It requires inner strength,HA VE YOU EVER NOTICED HOW MANY HIV POSITIVE PEOPLE SMOKE? I'm always amazed when I go to events inthe community and see people puffing away outside. Don'tthey know that smoking kills 45,000 Canadians each year\u2014three times more than car accidents, suicides, murder andAIDS combined?! I'm not one to judge. As an ex-smoker, I remember the habit fondly. I started around the age of 15 and smoked for 14years, quitting in 1988, just before my HIV diagnosis. I rolledmy own cigarettes. I liked the ritual of it and I thought itlooked cool to smoke. So I understand well the attraction andcomfort\u2014and addictive nature\u2014of cigarettes. you\u00d5re well aware that smoking has many long-term health risks, like: heart disease, emphysema, lung and other cancers (throat, pancreatic, stomach, breast, cervical, anal),gum disease and osteoporosis\u2014as many as one out of every two long-term smokers will die from a tobacco-related illness,according to the Canadian Cancer Society... you know that smoking can worsen certain problems and illnesses that people with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) are alreadyvulnerable to, such as lung and heart disease, gum and bone problems... Did you know that, in addition to all that, smoking may weaken your body\u00d5s response to highly active antiretroviraltherapy (HAART) ? University of Miami researchers found that HIV positive smokers' response to HAART decreased by about40% as measured through drug levels in the body, CD4 countsand viral loads. HIV certainly puts a lot on our plate: fear, depression, discrimination, illness, poverty, side effects...to list just a few. rationalizing an unhealthy habit with an excuse like \"I already have HIV , smoking is the least of my concerns,\"just doesn't cut it. Here are some more reasons why: HAVE A HEAR TMany of us are living longer thanks to HAART. But as we enter middle age, the risk of heart disease increases.In addition, HAART can hurt your heart, as protease inhibitorsThe IFS, ANDS or BUTS of butting out elevate lipid (fat) levels\u2014cholesterol and triglycerides\u2014in the blood. Adding smoking to themix further compounds cardiac concerns. BREA THE DEEPL YThe risk of developing pneumonia and tuberculosis, as well as emphysema,Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and other lung diseases is significantly higher in smokers with HIVthan smokers without. One study found that lungcancer is about eight times more prevalent in PHAsthan in our negative counterparts. Long-term viralsuppression doesn't completely restore the immunesystem, and a compromised immune system is moresusceptible to cancers. HIV positive smokers aredeveloping lung cancer at a much younger age thansmokers in the general population. STAY NOURISHED Due to high rates of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection among PHAs, we'reat increased risk for anogenital cancers. HPV isassociated with most genital warts and lesions, andsmoking inflates the risk that HPV will develop intocervical or anal cancer. The progression of theselesions and cancers is also associated with other co-factors, such as a weak immune system and poornutrition. Deficiencies in vitamin C and othernutrients are linked with cancer progression. Studieshave shown that smoking significantly reduces thebody's store of vitamin C. It also takes a toll on theimmune system by killing Langerhan cells, which fightoff viral infections like HPV . SPRING SUMMER 2004 23willpower, patience and support. For many people, becoming a non-smoker is a process. Y ou may need tomake several attempts before you finally kick the habit\u2014ittook me about five tries. I dealt with withdrawal symptomsby going to aerobics class every day for the first few monthsand taking extra B-complex vitamins to help me deal withstress. Over time, my craving lessened. While I was eventually able to quit cold turkey, some people prefer to gradually taper off by decreasing the numberof cigarettes smoked per day. When stress is high, it may notbe a good time to stop cold turkey. Self-caring de-stressorssuch as exercise, yoga or massage can help ease withdrawal. Cigarette addiction is 95% psychological and 5% physiological. Most nicotine is eliminated from your body inabout one week. Any cravings to smoke after that aren't fromnicotine withdrawal but from psychological stressors andbehavioural patterns. So, it may help to keep a diary of yoursmoking habits (when you light up, how you feel) to trackwhat \"triggers\" you to smoke. Then focus on avoiding orundoing these triggers (cut out that morning coffee or switchto tea). Another idea is to set limits to your smokingboundaries (no smoking in the house or after dinner). Ask your health care provider for support and suggestions. Here are a few:yCheck out a smoking-cessation program, like the Canadian Cancer Society's One Step at a Time (www.cancer.ca). yJoin a support group, in person or online. Y ou're not alone. At www.quitnet.com, about 400 people are onlineat any given time. One night a woman posted a noteasking for help as she held a cigarette in her hand, aboutto light up. Within a minute, a half-dozen people repliedwith tips on how to curb the craving. yPut on the patch or chew nicotine gum. yAsk your doc about the prescription pill Zyban (and about which HIV drugs it interacts with). yTry acupuncture or acupressure (shiatsu). yLook into interventions and special vitamin regimens. yClick on www.gosmokefree.ca (Health Canada) for more info.
