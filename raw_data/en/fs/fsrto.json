Conditions We Treat Hormone Imbalances | Digestive Disorders Insomnia | Immune Function Anxiety | Pain & more Specializing in Women's Health Every Age. Every Stage. Menstrual Issues | Peri-Menopause PCOS | Fertility | Pregnancy Postpartum Specializing in Women's Health Menstrual Issues Peri-Menopause Fertility | Pregnancy Postpartum PMS & painful periods are not normal. Most women expect to deal with a cocktail of symptoms each month... because pain is normal, right? I promise you, it is not. There is a reality where you just flow, and where your quality of life isn't tied to a hormonal roller coaster. PMS and other symptoms are often caused by stagnation (think stress, inactivity, emotional trauma, poor diet...), and that stagnation grows as your cycle progresses. Once the period begins it's like a damn breaking, and soon those symptoms move out. But the underlying cause of imbalance or stagnation is still present, so the cycle begins again each month. There is far too little education about caring for our reproductive health. As children we should be taught how different foods impact the way we feel, and that exercise reduces cramps and anxiety. We should be well versed in the long-term effects of various birth control methods, how to interpret cervical fluid, and exactly when to target or avoid intercourse for family planning. In reality, most women don't start getting acquainted with these topics until their 30's, or later. It isn't a subject people feel comfortable discussing, but it needs to be. Healthy hormone levels ensure happier periods, better fertility, and a much smoother perimenopause. They affect everything, even how you age! Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine are exceptional at addressing women's reproductive health, and they do so without negative side effects. If untreated, imbalances can compound and lead to more difficult situations like fibroids, endometriosis, PCOS, or Infertility. This is why it's so important to recognize the signs your body is exhibiting. We will help you detect the warning signs and also take a look at lifestyle habits to figure out what may be sabotaging your progress, and what can be shifted to keep you feeling your best. Let us guide you toward a better understanding of your body with treatments custom tailored to your needs at every stage of life. Let's talk about Menopause: - Menopause is your body's way of shifting it's resources away from giving life to someone else, and back to supporting life for YOU. - Perimenopause refers to the few years before and after your last menstrual cycle, when women typically feel signs of shifting hormones. - Menopause isn't a disease, it's a transition. - Menopause is the last menstrual period you will ever have, so you won't know this has occurred until enough time has passed to recognize it. - The average age of menopause is 51, and the normal range is 45-55, though some women may have early or premature menopause. - The health of your cycles today is a very good predictor of how smooth your menopausal transition will be in the future. - There is a whole world of knowledge and options that will help you feel more in control of your body. \"I've been working with Erica for more than two years and she's had such a tremendously positive impact on my health and wellbeing.
