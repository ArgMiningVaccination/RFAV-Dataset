Germs are easily spread by poor hygiene, contaminated water, spoiled food and animal contact, especially in tropical climates. Avoid undercooked hamburgers (ground meat is risky in places with erratic refrigeration) or condi - ment bottles that may have been sitting around for months in the blazing heat. In developing countries, tourists often fall victim to stomach upsets caused by bacteria, para- sites or viruses. Cruise ships are notorious for the Norwalk virus that causes sudden and violent bouts of diarrhea. Depending on the season and the region, tourists may also be at risk for insect-borne or epidemic outbreaks of diseases like malaria, yellow fever, typhoid or polio. \"Traveler's diarrhea is a common affliction,\" says Jack W. Ross, M.D., director of the Division of Infectious Disease at Hartford Hospital. \"Food and water may be contaminated by E. coli or other bacteria . Avoid buying fresh fruit or salads from local street vendors, and make sure you cook everything you can't peel. Drink bottled water and avoid ice cubes and frosted beer mugs. Don't even brush your teeth with tap water.\" Depending on your itinerary, Hartford Hospital's Travel Medicine Clinic or your medical provider can provide the appropriate vaccinations or booster shots to protect against hepatitis A, yellow fever, polio, tetanus and meningococcal meningitis. Be sure to call for an appointment six weeks before traveling abroad. If you're traveling to a rural area you may need typhoid vaccine or anti-malarial pills to take daily or weekly. Bring insect repellent containing DEET, over-the-counter antidiarrheal pills and a pocket-size bottle of hand sanitizer, often difficult to find abroad. \"Schedule your travel-related appointment well in advance of your departure date because it takes two to three weeks to develop immu - nity,\" adds Dr. Ross. \"Some equatorial regions require yellow fever immunization just to transit through a country.\" Before leaving the United States, ask your physician to prescribe antibiotic tablets to take along. You can buy over-the-counter medications in many countries, but you won't feel much like shopping between bouts of diarrhea. Stay alert to risks from potentially rabid animals\u2014and always buy travel insurance in case you need to fly home for serious medical concerns. For more information about risks, see www.cdc.gov/travel. Sunglasses shield the eyes and skin from the sun's harsh ultraviolet (UV) rays and protect against damaging UV exposures that harm the cornea and retina. Sustained exposure to both long-wave UVA and shorter-wave UVB radiation has been shown to accelerate the progression of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and cataracts. What's the difference between expensive designer shades and cheap sunglasses? Sunglasses made of tinted plastic offer no UV protection. Brand name \"knock-offs\" block some light, dilating the iris of the eye and increasing exposure to harmful UV rays. Look for the \"100% UV protection\" label. \"UV 400\" sunglasses block all wavelengths up to 400 nanometers (all UVA and UVB rays.) \"Photochromic\" lenses darken automatically when exposed to UV rays. \"Polarized\" sunglasses reduce glare and block reflected light off water, and are recommended for boating or water sports. Wraparound styles protect sensitive skin and eyelids. Summer Shades 2Potherbs The succulent herb Purslane (Portulaca oleraceae) is the source of alpha-linolenic acid, a heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acid. The American Heart Association says omega-3 fatty acids can help protect against heart attack, stroke, cancer and inflammatory diseases. Why bother with fish oil supplements when you can grow omega-3 fatty acids in your yard? It's easy to grow purslane indoors or out, since it does grow like a weed (it tends to take over the garden). According to University of Connecticut researchers, the herb is an excellent source of vitamins A, C and E and essential amino acids, and has been called a \"power food of the future\" because of its high nutritive and antioxidant properties. Another potherb, Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris) is readily available in gro - cery stores year round. High in fiber, iron and bone-building vitamin K, the leafy greens are rich in minerals and healthful phytonutrients . Garlic A member of the onion family, garlic (Allium sati - vum) has been used for both culinary and medicinal purposes throughout history. Garlic is high in man- ganese, vitamin B 6, vitamin C and selenium. Prized for its anti-inflammatory properties, garlic's pungent odor comes from a variety of powerful sulfur- containing compounds that have been studied for their health benefits. Numerous studies have shown that eating garlic regularly can lower blood pressure, cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels. A popular meal on the Greek island of Crete might consist of a salad, with finely chopped and pressed cucumber in a yogurt-and-olive oil dressing, seasoned with garlic and eaten with whole-grain bread. Curry Turmeric (Curcuma longa) has long been used in North African cuisine to flavor couscous and grains. The spice's bright yellow color reveals the presence of antioxidant and immune-boosting phytonutrients that counter the effects of aging. Ongoing clinical trials at universities around the country suggest that the golden spice of antiquity may help protect against heart disease, colon cancer, Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory disorders.Sardines Pilchards, sprats and tiny herrings are nutrient-rich, oily fish named for the Mediterranean island of Sardinia, where they once were found in abundance. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, they are a good source of bone-building calcium, as well as vitamin D, vita- min B 12 and protein. To reduce fat, choose varieties packed in spring water or tomato sauce rather than oil. Because they are low on the food chain, sardines contain less mercury than swordfish or mackerel. Figs On the windswept coast of the Mediterranean, figs (Ficus carica) have been cultivated for centuries. The ancient Greeks and Phoenicians dried the fruits, which have been prized since biblical times for relief of respiratory tract inflammation, cough, colds and aching throats. Figs are rich in potassium, a mineral that helps control blood pressure by reducing sodium levels. Figs are also high in fiber, protein, carbohy - drates, calcium, thiamin, riboflavin and iron. Feta cheese In Spain, it's called manchego, in France it's brebis, but either way, aged sheep or goat's milk cheeses are a staple of the southern European diet, along with Greek-style yogurt made from tangy ewe's milk. People living in the Mediterranean region eat relatively less cheese and dairy products made from cow's milk than we do. Sheep's milk is higher in calcium and can often be tolerated by people who are allergic to cow's milk, although low-fat or non-fat varieties are not readily available. Pomegranate Native to the Middle East, the pomegranate (Punica granatum) was an ancient symbol of fertility and abundance. Mediterranean peoples eat pomegran- ate seeds raw or sprinkle them on panna cotta, a pudding-like Italian dessert (literally cooked cream) often served with fresh berries or fruit coulis. Look for fresh pomegranates when they're harvested in the fall. Garnish eggplant and shrimp dishes with spicy anar - dana (dried wild pomegranate seeds). Antioxidant- rich red pomegranate juice has been shown to lower cholesterol and blood pressure, while reducing the risk of heart disease and cancer. Seven Secrets of the Mediterranean Diet Along the Mediterranean coast, flavorful herbs and native leafy green plants have been used for centuries as food or seasonings for the local harvest. Researchers are only now discovering the healthful benefits of weedlike \"potherbs\" that often grow wild in the Mediterranean region, North Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. These nutrient-dense foods from around the world offer anti-aging and health-protective benefits that Western consumers are only beginning to discover. WELLNESS \u2014Eating for Good Health 3In regions as distinct as a coral reef in Japan, the Hunza Valley of Pakistan and a subtropical village in Ecuador, people regularly live in good health to age 100 and beyond. What explains their longevity? Why do so few individuals on the Mediterranean island of Crete die of cardiovascular disease? Could it be the result of a diet rich in garlic, dried beans, cereal, nuts, yogurt and goat's milk? Do locally cultivated food crops, antioxidant-packed fruits and vegetables, and mountainous terrain add up to a healthy diet and plenty of exercise? French researchers studying longevity and nutrition in cultures worldwide found that the remarkably healthy centenarians\u2014whether in the equatorial village of Vilcabamba, Ecuador, or the glacial \"Shangri La\" of Pakistan\u2014eat a healthy diet that keeps them fit and trim. Climbing up and down rugged slopes helps, too. The good news: you don't need to exile yourself to a remote mountain valley to enjoy the healthful benefits of diet and exercise. Concerning Fat In the United States, changing recommenda - tions from governmental agencies, conflicting dietary advice and fad diets have left consumers mystified and perplexed. What should we eat now? Is all fat bad? What ever happened to oat bran? While many foods contain immune-boosting nutri - ents and antioxidants, dietitians warn that there is no such thing as a \"superfood\" that will keep you healthy and make you lose weight. Confusion abounds about the role of fat in a healthy diet. The popularity of overly restrictive low-fat diets may be propelling the nationwide surge in obesity, researchers warn, because fat helps people feel \"full\" or satiated. Essential nu - trients, such as essential fatty acids and vitamins A and E, come from fat in the diet. No wonder it's confusing. The \"saturated fats\" are bad, but \"monounsaturated fats\" are good. What's the difference? In simple terms, animal fats that are fully \"saturated\" with hydrogen atoms\u2014cream, cheese, butter and lard, for example\u2014aren't as good for you as the unsaturated fats found in nuts, seeds, fish and leafy greens. Unhealthy \"trans fats\" found in partially hydrogenated oils not only raise \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL), but also play a role in lowering \"good\" cholesterol (HDL). \"There are different types of dietary fats, but all have a mixture of fatty acids of varying degrees of carbon-chain length and degree of saturation,\" explains Brunella A. Ibarrola M.S., R.D., CD-N, of Hartford Department Nutrition \"Fats are classified as predomi - nately saturated, monounsaturated or polyun - saturated. Studies have shown that saturated fats are less healthy than monounsaturated fats. Polyunsaturated vegetable oils should be con - sumed in moderation. Most people should substi - tute foods rich in monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil, canola oil, nuts and avocados.\" Why A Mediterranean Diet? The \"Mediterranean\" diet\u2014lots of fruits and vegetables, fish, lean meats, legumes and cereals, olive oil and a small glass of red wine\u2014has been shown to be beneficial for cardiovascular health and may even help stave off Alzheimer's disease. The typical Mediterranean diet is high in fiber and rich in cholesterol-free fats derived from plants, such as olive oil, rather than the saturated fats found in meat and dairy products. The Mediterranean diet is simple and varied. The \"diet\" shared by many countries that border the Mediterranean is a style of eating influenced by culture and religion. In Greece, people pair local, seasonal, fresh produce with moderate amounts of starch and very little meat. Spaniards graze on a variety of snack-size tapas\u2014 small serv - ings of foods like stuffed tomatoes, garlic shrimp, spicy mussels or lime-drizzled ceviche. Scientists are rediscovering what the Europeans and Middle Easterners have always known\u2014good health is linked to a diet high in fruit, vegetables and grains and low in fat. Eating one-half cup of beans daily significantly reduces total cholesterol. Whole grains found in bread, rice, pasta, oatmeal, cereal and tortillas are low in fat and high in fiber, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. \"I ask my patients to eat seven to 10 fruits and vegetables daily, and to consume only whole grains,\" says cardiologist Donna M. Polk, M.D., director of Preventive Cardiology at Hartford Food for ThoughtWELLNESS \u2014Eating for Good Health 4WELLNESS \u2014Eating for Good Health Dr. Donna Polk chooses an assortment of fruits and vegetables at Wade's Farm Fresh market, a year round farm stand in Bloomfield that features locally grown produce. Dr. Polk recommends eating a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables for good health and longevity. Hospital. \"In addition to its cardiovascular benefits, following a Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of colon cancer.\" Here's to Your Health Along the Mediterranean coast, families gather every evening to share a con - vivial aperitif, often a single glass of wine or Campari before dinner. \"I never tell people to go out and drink alcohol to prevent heart disease,\" says Dr. Polk. \"But if they're consuming alcohol on a regular basis, they should know that there's some evidence that alcohol in moderation can help protect the heart. Studies show that it's not the type of alcohol, but the fact that a daily drink is a compo - nent of a Mediterranean diet.\" Women should not drink more than four to five ounces of wine daily (or one beer or an ounce of alcohol), while men could drink slightly more, equivalent to an ounce and a half of liquor. \"Although a daily drink may help prevent heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption greatly increases the risk for stroke, especially in women,\" warns Dr. Polk. The Mediterranean diet may also reduce your risk for dementia caused by tiny strokes in the brain. Columbia University researchers recently found that people who closely followed a Mediterranean diet were 36 percent less likely to have areas of brain damage than those with poor eating habits. Why Are We So Fat? Across the nation, nearly two-thirds of adults\u2014and nearly 20 percent of adolescents\u2014are overweight or obese. Overeating, inactivity and fat-laden fast foods quickly pack on the pounds. Despite controversy over whether the culprit is saturated fat, trans fats, sugar, or carbohydrates, the fact remains\u2014Americans are growing fatter. \"The simplest thing you can do avoid obesity is to weigh yourself every day and keep track of the results,\" says Paul M. Thompson, M.D., director of Cardiology at Hartford Hospital. \"No one gains 50 pounds in one week\u2014it hap - pens slowly over a lifetime. If you see your weight go up even a few pounds, lose it. It's easier to lose one pound 50 times than 50 pounds once.\" \"Studies have shown that type 2 diabetes more than doubles the risk of a heart attack or stroke,\" says Robin Rhoades, R.D., an outpatient dietitian at Diabetes LifeCare at Hartford Hospital. \"Type 2 diabetes is linked to overweight and inactivity, as well as other factors, including family history. Would you be willing to eat more vegetables, fruits and whole grains if they would help reduce your risk for diabetes, heart disease and cancer?\" Vegetarian diets are going mainstream. \"Lately I have been asked about the benefits of vegetarian diets for prevention and control of diabetes,\" she adds. \"I encourage trying one vegetarian meal per week as a goal. I highly recommend limiting processed and fast foods, and adopting a Mediterranean lifestyle way of eating because of the all the terrific phytochemicals and fiber in nutrient-dense foods.\" What to Eat Now Nuts contain healthy fats that can go a long way toward hunger management, while adding magnesium and fiber to your diet. \"A handful of almonds or walnuts impedes stomach emptying,\" suggests Dr. Thompson. \"Drink a big glass of water before every meal and between meals if you feel hungry.\"WELLNESS \u2014Eating for Good Health 6CLINICIAN PROFILE Robin Rhoades, R.D. For reasons that remain unclear, people who are depressed eat more choco - late than those who aren't, according to a new study. Researchers say depressed people crave chocolate because of mood-boosting chemicals that have soothing effects on the brain. In addition to chocolate's antidepressant and antioxidant effects, studies suggest that dark chocolate's anti-inflammatory action may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. Whatever the next food fad, everyone agrees that a healthy diet should include brightly hued berries, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower, leafy greens and citrus fruits. Vibrant colors hint at immune- boosting phytonutrients that counter the effects of aging. Colorful fruits and vegetables contain disease-fighting antioxidants believed to prevent cancer and protect the heart. What Not to Eat Even food processing companies are finally getting the message that con - sumers want to eat a healthy diet. Manufacturers like Kraft and Ocean Spray have reformulated products to reduce or eliminate high-fructose corn syrup. While some scientists say corn syrup is no worse than sugar, others argue that the highly processed food is made from corn, an energy-consuming and pesti - cide-laden crop. As a result of the new health care legislation, fast-food chain restaurants will now prominently display calorie counts and nutrition informa - tion on menu boards and drive-throughs. Although government experts recommend consuming no more than 2,400 mg. (one teaspoon) of sodium per day, Americans eat an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 mg. of sodium daily. Food manufacturers are being urged to voluntarily reduce the amount of sodium in processed and prepared foods, from salad dressings to soups. \"Salt doesn't raise everyone's blood pressure to the point of needing medication,\" says Dr. Polk. \"Some people are more salt-sensitive than others. Overall, there is a public health benefit to reducing salt because so many Americans with hypertension are struggling to reduce their salt intake.\" Green Choices What do the world's longest-lived people have in common? Whether they in - habit the lost kingdom of the Himalayas or a valley beneath Ecuador's Sleeping Inca mountain, the healthiest people in the world eat fresh, organic food and drink natural mineral water. In the Hunza Valley, people eat apricots, swim in icy streams and climb up and down hillsides. Instead of chemical pesticides, they spray their fruit trees with a mixture of ash and water to repel pests. Organic foods, though more costly, can help minimize exposure to worrisome chemicals and reduce our national reliance on petroleum-based pesticides. Local farmers often use fewer chemicals and save energy with lower transportation costs. President Obama's Cancer Panel recently warned that the \"risk of environ - mentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.\" \"Fruits, vegetables and whole grains play a vital role in helping to prevent cancer,\" says dietitian Ann Zogbaum, M.S., R.D., of the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center. \"We encourage our patients to consume a variety of fruits and vegetables that provide color and different textures to each meal and encourage the appetite with their wonderful flavors. Supporting our local farmers markets provides the ultimate in freshness and taste. Washing and properly preparing our produce, no matter where we purchase it, is still very important.\"WELLNESS \u2014Eating for Good Health Robin Rhoades, R.D., a registered dietitian with Hartford Hospital's Diabetes LifeCare program, works in an outpatient setting helping patients plan healthy meals to maintain good blood-sugar control. In accordance with recommendations from the American Dietetic Association, she teaches nutrition classes to help individu - als reduce their risk of diabetes and also works one-on-one with people diagnosed with type 1, type 2 or gestational diabetes. For Ms. Rhoades, her work as a dietitian was a second career, following 10 years as an assistant city clerk in city government. She earned a B.S. in nutritional sciences at Syracuse University, and completed an internship at Strong Memorial Hospital at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. Before joining Hartford Hospital, she worked as a inpatient dietitian at the Athens Regional Medical Center in Athens, Georgia. Currently, she is busy running and working out to train for an upcoming mini- triathlon in September, when she plans to swim in the ocean, bike and run alongside her 75-year-old mother, who completed the race last year. For fun, she kayaks and reads fiction. 7Prescription for WellnessWELLNESS \u2014Top 10 Tips for Healthy Living 3. Lose Weight Overweight and obese individuals are at high risk for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, diabetes and cancer. According to the journal Obesity, people with flabby fat de - posits around their heart are nearly five times more likely to suffer from atherosclero - sis in their coronary arteries. \"Cut down on saturated fat, milk and meat,\" says Dr. Thompson. \"Get a dog and go for a brisk walk every day. Especially if you're over - weight, go up and down hills to help improve your cardiovascular health.\"5. Get Fit Vigorous exercise and physical fitness are vital to good health. Exercise helps preserve cardiac health, maintains a lower body weight, prevents muscle loss and staves off osteoporosis. Fitness can be achieved with 30 minutes of brisk walking or other moderate exercise every day. Those age 65 and older who regularly walk or exercise moderately can significantly lower their risk of developing vascular dementia. If you smoke, quit. Smoking does significant damage to your heart and arteries, and puts you at risk for cancer.2. Make Healthy Changes \"Lifestyle changes can reduce cholesterol levels dramatically,\" says Cardiologist Donna M. Polk, M.D. \"Dietary changes\u2014such as adding fiber to your diet\u2014can really improve cholesterol levels. Weight loss and increasing one's level of activity can also reduce risk. It's important to know that exercise burns calories, but it takes dietary changes plus longer periods of exercise (60-90 minutes) to really shed pounds.\" \"People with heart problems are motivated to change,\" adds Ellen Dornelas, Ph.D., director of Behavioral Health, Preventive Cardiology, at Hartford Hospital. \"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps people reshape their thoughts. By learning to modify your thinking, you can reduce anxiety, making you less prone to medical problems.\"1. Take Heart A strong heart is the key to wellness. High cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes raise the risk of develop - ing cardiovascular disease and artery- clogging atherosclerosis for both men and women, especially if they're obese. Erectile dysfunction may be a warning sign that arteries aren't circulating blood properly.4. Know Your Numbers Make sure you know not only your total cholesterol level, but also how the total breaks down into its \"good\" and \"bad\" components. A low level of good cholesterol may be a greater risk factor for a heart attack than a high level of bad choles - terol, warns Dr. Thompson. Cholesterol Healthy total cholesterol: < 200 mg/dL Risky total cholesterol: > 240 mg/dL Optimal HDL (good) cholesterol: > 40 mg/dL (men); > 50 mg/dL (women) Risky LDL (bad) choles - terol: > 100 mg/dL Triglycerides Healthy: < 150 blood pressure is the underlying cause of one in six deaths in the United States. \"Hypertension is a silent killer that can lead to lead to stroke and heart failure,\" says Dr. Thompson. \"Get your blood pressure measured at least twice a year. Be sure to take all medications for high blood pressure regularly, because over time hypertension and coronary heart disease can lead to stroke, heart attack and heart failure.\"A healthy lifestyle\u2014including exercise, stress reduction, sufficient sleep and a good diet\u2014can add years of vitality to your life. Before beginning a diet-and-exercise regimen, be sure to check with your primary care physician. If you don't have one, call Hartford Hospital's Health/Physician Referral Service at (860) 545-1888 or (800) 545-7664. 89. Reduce Stress Although everyone experiences ups and downs in daily life, major life changes can trigger violent physical responses. Sudden stress can be devas - tating to the heart. Over time, elevated stress hormones can disrupt immune function and impair regulation of blood sugar and blood pressure. The Henry Low Heart Center at Hartford Hospital offers stress manage - ment techniques to help prevent heart disease, as well as psychological counseling for patients after heart attack, coronary bypass surgery and heart transplant, as well as those with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Dr. Dornelas is now enroll - ing patients in two federally funded clinical trials. The RISTA study will assess the impact of stress management for patients with ICDs and the CODIACS trial will examine a new treatment for people with depression and heart disease. These are just two of many ongoing clinical trials at Hartford Hospital. (For a complete listing, see www.harthosp.org/research/ ClinicalTrialsdefault.aspx.)8. Seek Help The best place to start is your primary care physician. Hartford Medical Group physicians and staff in suburban locations are available to care for patients seven days a week, including weekday evening hours. The Institute of Living offers group counseling, education, medication management and support for people with psychiatric and substance abuse problems. For online support groups for addiction, coronary heart disease, hypertension or smoking cessation, go to www. dailystrength.org.6. Sleep Well Sleep may be a matter of life and death. People who sleep less than seven or more than nine hours have higher mortal - ity rates\u2014and those who get less than six hours per night have an increased risk of dying prematurely. Insomnia affects appetite and metabolism, reducing energy and contributing to weight gain. Someone who sleeps less than seven hours a night is more likely to be obese than someone who sleeps seven hours or more. \"Go to bed at the same time every night,\" urges Natalya Thorevska, M.D., who specializes in pulmo - nary, critical care and sleep medicine at Hartford Hospital. \"If you don't fall asleep within 30 minutes, get up and do something relaxing in a quiet room.\" Instead of prescription or over-the-counter sleeping pills recommended only for short-term use, try cognitive behav - ioral therapy (CBT) at the Institute of Living's Anxiety Disorders Center. Practice good \"sleep hygiene\"\u2014no caffeine in the second half of the day (it stays in the brain for up to eight hours), avoid heavy meals or exercise in the evening\u2014 and go to bed only when it's time to sleep. 7. Read a Good Book Here are a few recommendations from Hartford Hospital physicians: Paul M. Thompson, M.D., Director of Cardiology The Perfect Mile: Three Athletes, One Goal, and Less Than Four Minutes to Achieve It by Neal Bascomb (2005). Frances Gurtman, M.D., Medical Director, Hartford Medical Group, South Main St., West Hartford Healthy Aging by Andrew Weil (2007) and Men's Health magazine. Ellen Dornelas, Ph.D., Director of Behavioral Health, Preventive Cardiology Happy: Simple Steps to Get the Most Out of Life by Ian K. Smith (2010) and A Day Away From Stress , narrated by Stuart McCalley, M.D. (a CD of relaxation techniques).10. Learn to Relax \"Relaxation techniques help people learn to reduce their physiological reactivity to stress, and cognitive strategies help people learn to clear their mind from intrusive or worri - some thoughts,\" says Dr. Dornelas. \"Everybody can learn very simple techniques for stress management\u2014slow, rhythmic, diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation are examples of basic relaxation skills. We live in a fast-paced cul - ture with many demands upon us. The ability to clear our mind from the things that worry us is a life skill. Most people can learn to become more calm and better able to cope with life stressors through practicing stress management techniques.\" 9 | in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & Breakthroughs Herbal Hype Gingko biloba does not stop cognitive decline and memory loss, according to a randomized, placebo- controlled study funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Seniors who took the supple ment twice a day to prevent Alzheimer's disease did no better on a variety of cognitive tests and neu - ropsychological evaluations than those who took dummy pills.Prostate Promise Widely prescribed to shrink enlarged prostates, Avodart may reduce prostate cancer incidence by 23 percent in men at risk for the disease, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. The risk reduction was similar to that seen in an earlier trial of a similar drug, Proscar. Both drugs work by blocking conver - sion of testosterone into a key hormone associated with prostate growth.Cancer Chances Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, have identified three breast cancer \"biomarkers.\" Women with all three\u2014designated p16, COX-2 and Ki67\u2014have a 20 percent chance of devel - oping invasive breast cancer over eight years compared with only a 4 percent risk in those with no biomark - ers. Women diagnosed early with ductal carcinoma in situ undergo treatments ranging from mastectomy to lumpec - tomy and radiation.Sexual Healing Sex is good for a man's heart, reports the American Journal of Cardiology . Massachusetts Male Aging Study researchers correlated low frequency of sexual ac - tivity with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Men who reported having sex once a month or less had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than those who had sex twice a week or more, regardless of age or erectile dysfunction.How can you tell when a pain in your abdomen is something serious? Appendicitis results when sudden\u2014and potentially deadly\u2014inflammation of the appendix causes abdominal pain. The vestigial organ is a \"blind pouch\" of intestine that serves no known purpose. Although the incidence of appendicitis peaks in adolescence, it can occur in anyone, from babies to the elderly. Left untreated, an inflamed appendix will eventually burst, or perforate, leading to a life-threatening abscess in the abdominal cavity. In general, the longer the delay between diagnosis and surgery, the greater the likelihood of perforation.. Symptoms of appendicitis include mild to severe pain, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever and loss of ap - petite. \"Inflammation results from an obstruction in the appendix,\" explains general surgeon David Curtis, M.D., of Connecticut Surgical Group, who specializes in hepato- biliary-pancreatic surgery. \"Pain begins around the navel, and as the inflammation worsens, migrates to the lower right quadrant.\" Surgery is urgently needed to remove the appendix. \"The earlier, the better,\" says Dr. Curtis. \"Don't wait. Someone with severe pain that persists for six hours on the lower right side should go directly to the emergency room.\" Blood work and a CT (cat) scan typically are used to evaluate the inflammation and confirm the suspected diag - nosis, which is particularly helpful in women, since lower abdominal pain may be caused by gynecological problems that affect the ovary or Fallopian tubes rather than the appendix. Most patients are candidates for laparoscopic surgery, which allows Dr. Curtis to remove the appendix by making only three tiny incisions. Most people spend one night in the hospital afterward receiving intra- venous antibiotics. \"Patients with a perforated appendix, abscesses or other complications may need longer hospitalization, as their recovery can be more difficult.\"Appendix: Rupture Risk 10An estimated two mil - lion Americans suffer from Tourette's syndrome, a neurological disorder marked by repeated and uncontrolled involuntary movements and vocaliza - tions called tics. Boys are diagnosed with the disorder four times more often than girls, usually in childhood. Even though most cases are mild, with barely noticeable tics, affected children often suffer from other neurodevelopmental problems. \"Whether motor or vocal, tics peak in terms of intensity around age 10-11 or in early adoles - cence,\" says Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist Robert Sahl, M.D., of the Institute of Living (IOL). \"Most tics decline in frequency or completely go away by the early 20s.\" Contrary to popular belief, Tourette's syndrome is more than an uncontrollable stream of profanities. While some individuals with Tourette's syndrome blurt obscenities\u2014an inexplicable phenomenon called copralia \u2014it's far from the most common feature of the disorder. The first symptom is usually a facial tic. \"Motor tics by themselves are very common,\" says Dr. Sahl. \"A diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome requires both mo - tor and vocal tics. Tourette's syndrome afflicts an estimated one percent of children, although tics in general affect as many as four to eight percent of kids.\" Over time, people with Tourette's syndrome learn to recognize their own \"premonitory signs\" that precede a bout of tics. Sufferers may \"bottle up\" their tics all day at school, for example, and then come home and spend an hour releasing them. \"Tics may increase in frequency and complexity in re - sponse to stressful school or home situations,\" says Dr. Sahl. \"College pressures, for example, may cause a teenager to develop tics\u2014eye blinks, twitches of the upper lip or shoul - der shrugs. Most of the time, people aren't aware of their motor tics until they're pointed out to them. Even children with Tourette's syndrome are unaware of their involuntary vocalizations at first. They may be bullied in school because of their repetitive coughing, sniffing or throat clearing.\" Tourette's syndrome has been linked to abnormalities in the size and symmetry of brain structures and disruptions Tourette's Syndrome: Tics and Vocalizations in dopamine pathways that help nerve cells communicate with one another in the brain. Several related conditions, includ - ing attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-com - pulsive disorder (OCD), intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder are often diagnosed along with Tourette's syndrome. The latest theory about Tourette's syn - drome is that abnormal brain activity afflicts specific regions of the cortico-striatal circuit, especially affecting the basal ganglia in the brain. There is a genetic component to Tourette's syndrome, which has been linked to multiple risk genes on several different chromosomes. New imaging capabilities and better understanding of the workings of the prefrontal cortex and thalamus may provide targets for further investigation and better drug therapy. Medications typically prescribed for Tourette's syn - drome often have serious side effects, so most individuals try a variety of medications before settling on the best choice. Some children respond to antipsychotics, includ - ing Risperdal, Seroquel or Geodon. Others take Clonidine or Tenex (guanfacine), two drugs originally created to treat high blood pressure. Some researchers have suggested links between Tourette's syndrome and PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections), an autoimmune disorder that arises after a bacterial infection, but usually resolves on its own. \"The theory is that children get a strep throat and then several weeks later develop tics and become hyperactive when antibodies attack nerve tissue such as the basal ganglia,\" says Dr. Sahl. \"As kids get older, if tics are well controlled, we taper medications to see how they do,\" says Dr. Sahl. \"People with Tourette's syndrome often suffer from anxiety or depressive disorders. An experimental treatment at the IOL called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has shown efficacy for depression. Researchers hope that 'deep brain stimulation' may also help reduce tics associated with Tourette's syndrome.\" 11 Call the Health/Physician Referral Service at 860-545-1888 or 800-545-7664 for information about any program.
