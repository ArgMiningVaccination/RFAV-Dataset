Diana, PhD Kevin Callison, PhD Janna Wisniewski, PhD Charles Stoecker, PhD Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 2 A. General Background and Information As of 2016, Louisiana had the fifth highest per-capita rate of opioid prescriptions among U.S. states and was above the national average in drug overdose deaths (CDC, 2018). Furthermore, from 2015 to 2016, deaths in Louisiana from opioid overdose increased by 22% (KFF, 2018). The Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) suggests nearly 14 thousand admissions for SUD last year. Table 1: Substance Abuse Treatment Admissions by Primary Substance of Abuse, among admissions aged 12 and older: Louisiana 2017 Primary Substance Number Primary Substance Number Alcohol only 793 Other stimulants 17 Alcohol with secondary drug 891 Tranquilizers 140 Heroin 1,129 Sedatives 37 Other opiates 743 Hallucinogens 28 Cocaine (smoked) 649 PCP 33 Amphetamines 1,510 TOTAL 13,903 The National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) is an annual survey of facilities providing substance abuse treatment. In Louisiana, 157 substance abuse treatment facilities were included in the 2016 N-SSATS, which reported a total of 9,628 clients in substance abuse treatment on March 31, 2016. (http://www.samhsa.gov/data/2k3/NSSATS/NSSATS.pdf). Treatment options for patient with SUD include one or more of the following service components: Individual and group counseling Inpatient and residential treatment Intensive outpatient treatment Partial hospital programs Case or care management Medication Recovery support services 12-Step fellowship Peer supports Source: https://www.samhsa.gov/treatment/substance-use-disorders Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 3 Among the treatment options are Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD). However, from its inception in 1965, Medicaid has excluded IMD coverage for those between the ages of 21 and 64 (Section 1905(a)(B) of the Social Security Act). The IMD exclusion was intended to focus treatment of mental diseases at non-residential settings and leave states with the responsibility for funding inpatient psychiatric services (https://lac.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMD_exclusion_fact_sheet.pdf). Since 2012, Louisiana has been able to include coverage of IMD provided services under the Louisiana Behavioral Health Partnership (LBHP) and, later, Healthy Louisiana, since coverage was determined to be \"cost-effective\" and capitated by the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH). In 2016, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) revised regulations and changed capitation policies prohibiting coverage (Federal participation in coverage) for IMD stays beyond 15 days per month. In response to the growing concern over rates of opioid use disorders (OUDs) and substance use disorders (SUDs) in general, the Louisiana Department of Health applied for a Section 1115(a) Demonstration in 2017 to allow for the continuation of treatment for OUD/SUD in institutions for mental diseases (IMDs) regardless of the length of stay.1,2 In addition, the waiver included several other proposed interventions aimed at improving outcomes for those with an OUD/SUD in areas such as access to critical levels of care for OUD/SUD, the use of evidence-based SUD patient placement criteria, access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and care coordination and transition between levels of OUD/SUD care. The Healthy Louisiana Substance Use Disorder 1115 Demonstration was approved by CMS on February 1, 2018 and will continue through December 31, 2022. The scope of the demonstration requires no change in Medicaid eligibility, therefore the affected population will be Medicaid beneficiaries in the state of Louisiana who are treated for an OUD/SUD. The purpose of the demonstration is to maintain critical access to OUD/SUD services and continue delivery system improvements to provide more coordinated and comprehensive treatment for Medicaid beneficiaries. The demonstration aims to achieve the following goals: a. Increase access to evidence-based OUD/SUD care b. Increase access to and utilization of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD/SUD c. Ensure sufficient provider capacity at each level of care for OUD/SUD d. Decrease use of medically inappropriate care and reduced reliance on emergency department and hospital services for OUD/SUD treatment e. Reduce readmission rates for OUD/SUD treatment f. Increase use of evidence-based OUD/SUD patient placement criteria g. Increase initiation of follow-up after discharge from the emergency department or hospital for OUD/SUD 1 Section 1905 42 of U.S.C. 1396d defines IMDs as \"a hospital, nursing facility, or other institution of more than 16 beds, that is primarily engaged in providing diagnosis, treatment, or care of persons with mental diseases, including medical attention, nursing care, and related services.\" 2 While IMDs have been excluded from federal financial participation since Medicaid's inception, several states have used an \"in lieu of\" policy to fund IMD care using federal dollars through capitated payments to managed care organizations (Musumeci, 2018). In May 2016, CMS implemented a policy to limit \"in lieu of\" payments to IMD stays to 15 days in a calendar month (Priest et al., 2017) Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 4 h. Increase adherence to and retention in treatment i. Reduce instances of drug overdose and overdose deaths The demonstration implementation plan includes five separate milestones that address various areas of OUD/SUD treatment including access, placement, standards of care, and provider capacity. We develop hypotheses surrounding these milestones and their potential impact on the demonstration goals and describe our proposed methodology for testing these hypotheses below.Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 5 B.

Using files obtained from Louisiana Medicaid data warehouse, including inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and long-term care claims, we will identify beneficiaries with a substance use diagnosis or treatment code during the pre- and post-demonstration periods. We will link beneficiaries with a SUD diagnosis or treatment during the specified time periods to Medicaid eligibility data and demographic characteristics, to identify the months a beneficiary was enrolled in Medicaid. The analysis will include the first month where a SUD diagnosis or treatment claim was observed for the beneficiary and for up to eleven additional months that did not include claims for SUD diagnosis or treatment if the beneficiary remained enrolled in Medicaid. Repeated SUD diagnoses or treatment claims will extend the observation period included in the analysis. Organize the data to create a file with an observation for each month a beneficiary is Medicaid-eligible, on or after their first observed SUD-related claim during the analysis period. For each month that an individual is enrolled, the data file will contain an observation with their Medicaid costs in that month, using the ten variables specified in Table 1 and demographic characteristics merged from the eligibility data. Develop shadow cost prices. As Louisiana Medicaid patients are in managed care we will use the published fee-for-service schedule for Louisiana's Medicaid program. This list maps Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and provider types onto dollar costs. Additionally, there are Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes that define daily charges for SUD IMD stays and these rates are specific to SUD patients. Waiver administrative costs. The costs for administering Louisiana's SUD 1115 waiver program are entirely staffing costs. There are 10 staff members involved in administering the waiver program. We will ask each staff member to estimate the percentage of their effort spent on administering the SUD waiver, percentage of time spent supporting the waiver evaluation efforts, and percentage of time spent on other duties. We will multiply the percentage efforts spent directly on administering the waiver by salaries to obtain administrative costs for the waiver program. Calculate and trend average monthly spending. From the individual month-level data, we will calculate average costs, across the categories presented in Table 3, separated into months before the demonstration and months after. These means will be plotted to show trends visually and to verify that month-to-month variation is within expectations and does not indicate an underlying data error. Depending on variance in costs we may collapse data to the quarterly level to smoothly out monthly variation in costs.

This is necessary as there is no geographic or eligibility variation in the Louisiana Medicaid population in who is eligible for these services. For our interrupted time series regression analysis of costs, we will include an indicator equal to 1 for months on or after the start date of the demonstration and equal to 0 for the pre-demonstration period months. Our regression model will also include covariates to control for age, race, gender, and dual eligibility status. We will model costs in a two-part model where the first part is a logit model where the outcome is whether there are any costs in the person-month and in the second part the outcome is log costs as costs are typically not normally distributed. For each outcome in Table 3 we will run the following model: Costs = 0 + 1*TIME + 2*POST + 3*(TIME*POST) + i* CONTROLS + Where: TIME is a count variable that starts with the first quarter pre-demonstration period data and ends with the last quarter of post-demonstration period data. POST is the indicator variable that equals 1 if the month occurred on or after demonstration start date. CONTROLS are covariates, such as age, gender, race, dual Medicare-Medicaid enrollment, and month. Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 18 We will report marginal effects and standard errors to assess statistically significant changes in costs. Changes in average costs after the intervention will be captured by 2. If this is positive and statistically significant it will indicate costs are higher in the post-demonstration period. Changes in trends in costs will be captured by 3. If this is positive and statistically significant it will indicate cost trends have increased in the post period. Together these two coefficients will capture potential program impacts on cost. We will also report regression adjusted means (either monthly or quarterly), as described previously, to make regression results more easily interpretable for lay audiences. Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 19 C. Methodology C.1 Evaluation Methodology We will use three methods to evaluate the hypotheses listed in Table 2. When it is possible to designate a control group, our preferred methodology will be a differences-in-differences (DD) design. DD is a quasi-experimental research technique that compares changes over time for a group that is impacted by an intervention (treatment group) to a group that is unaffected by the intervention (control group). The inclusion of a control group enhances the rigor of the research design and reduces the concern over potential confounders as estimates from the DD model are unaffected by changes common to both the treatment and control groups. We discuss the specifics of the DD models we plan to implement in our evaluation in Section C.5 below and describe limitations of the DD method in Section D. Use of the DD methodology will not be possible when we are unable to identify an appropriate control group who would be plausibly unaffected by a particular intervention. Instead, we will rely on one of two alternative research designs: interrupted time series analysis or a pre/post analysis. The interrupted-time series (ITS) method examines changes over time in an outcome for a treatment group. The evaluation period spans the periods before and after the intervention so as to capture changes that correspond to the timing of the intervention. An ITS analysis does not require a control group, but instead compares changes within the treatment group over time. As an example, suppose we track rates of ED admissions for OUD/SUD in Louisiana in the periods before and after enactment of the milestones described in the state's implementation plan. The ITS works by statistically modeling the trend over time in OUD/SUD ED use and determines whether the level or slope of the trend changes at a point in time that corresponds to the intervention. The level change identifies any immediate effect of the intervention, while the change in slope (or trend) will capture changes over time. Finally, for a small number of outcomes, both the DD and ITS will be infeasible. This will occur when we are unable to identify an appropriate control group and when time-series data on a particular outcome is limited. For example, since ASAM Level 1-WM treatment was not a covered benefit prior to the demonstration, we cannot model the trend in this treatment over time for Medicaid beneficiaries. In these cases, we will use a simple pre/post analysis to statistically compare changes in outcomes from the pre-intervention period to the post-intervention period. C.2 Target and Comparison Populations For most analyses, the target population will consist of the Medicaid population with an OUD/SUD. The inclusion criterion for this group is Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in a specific reporting period (e.g., month or year) with a paid/accepted claim that uses an OUD/SUD diagnosis code as the primary diagnosis. When examining changes in physician certified dispensers, the target population will include all waivered physicians in the state of Louisiana listed in the SAMHSA Buprenorphine Treatment Practitioner Locator and the DATA-Certified Physician Totals. In some specifications, we will compare changes in the number of waivered physicians in Louisiana to changes in other states. Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 20 In those instances, our population will expand to include physicians from non-SUD demonstration states. In addition, we will use NPI provider records from the Medicaid claims data to measure active physician treatment for SUD services. Finally, when examining overdose deaths, our target population will be comprised of those whose cause of death is listed as an \"accidental poisoning by and exposure to drugs and other biological substances\" in both Louisiana and other control states. C.3 Evaluation Period The evaluation period for analyses using the Medicaid claims data will begin in January 2014 and will be ongoing through the projected end of the demonstration in December 2022. Though the demonstration was approved in February 2018, we will incorporate data from the 2014 through 2017 in order to establish trends and use-rates in the pre-demonstration period. We will then measure changes in these outcomes from the pre-demonstration to post-demonstration periods. C.4 Data Sources The primary data source for our analysis is the Louisiana Medicaid claims database. We have obtained this data through an agreement with the Louisiana Department of Health. Additional data sources include the Buprenorphine Treatment Practitioner Locator and DATA-Certified Physicians Totals collected by SAMHSA and the National Vital Statistics System Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death Restricted Use Files. The Buprenorphine Treatment Practitioner Locator and DATA-Certified Physicians data are freely available through SAMHSA's website. We will apply for access to restricted-use versions of the Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death files, which is necessary in order to obtain geographic identifiers. The quality of the Medicaid claims data is quite high and the data have few limitations for our purposes. We have access to the universe of Medicaid claims data, including prescription drug files, so that we are able to construct a nearly complete picture of beneficiary care for OUD/SUD. Limitations of these data would include coding inconsistencies across MCOs in Louisiana and our inability to observe any patient care obtained that is not financed through the Medicaid system. However, these limitations are not expected to be significant causes of concern for our evaluation as coding for OUD/SUD treatment is standardized and relatively few Medicaid beneficiaries are expected to receive care for which a claim was not processed through the Medicaid program. Similarly, the quality of the Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death files is generally seen to be high as the data are derived from individual death certificates and are a near census of all deaths in U.S. According to the National Vital Statistics System, the Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death files are a \"fundamental\" source of information on cause of death. A potential limitation of these data is underreporting of opioid overdose as a cause of death. For example, Buchanich et al. (2018) suggests that as many as 70,000 opioid overdose deaths from 1999 to 2015 were misclassified as \"unspecified overdose deaths\". To address this limitation, we plan to analyze both opioid-related overdose deaths and all deaths due to overdose. Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 21 SAMHSA maintains two sources of data on physician certification for treating OUD/SUD through MAT: The Buprenorphine Treatment Practitioner Locator and DATA-Certified Physicians database. Data elements on DATA-Certified Physicians is collected from online submission forms that physicians must complete in order to attain waiver certification. The Buprenorphine Treatment Practitioner Locator data is taken from practitioner profiles maintained by SAMHSA. In both cases, the quality of the data depend on the accuracy of the information provided by physicians. Inaccuracies are likely to be minimal for data on the counts of waivered physicians, while information on physician location (including practice address) will be more susceptible to error. We can use the Medicaid Claims Provider files to improve our understanding of physician location. We have obtained Louisiana Medicaid claims data from January 2014 through February 2018 and will continue to receive updated claims at 6-month intervals. The Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death files are made available with a 1-year lag (i.e., data for the year 2017 will be made available in December 2018). We will apply for the Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death files through 2018 and continue to apply for updated data each year as new files are made available. The SAMHSA data is updated annually with some delay. C.5 Analytic Methods Quantitative Methods Our preferred methodology for evaluating the hypotheses listed above is a quasi-experimental research design known as difference-in-differences (DD). The term quasi-experimental refers to approaches like DD that attempt to mimic a randomized controlled trial by assigning individuals to a treatment group or a control group and then measuring changes between the two groups over time. The treatment group is defined by exposure to an intervention, while the control group should ideally be similar to the treatment group but remain unexposed. Under standard assumptions for the DD methodology (listed in section D), changes in outcomes for the treatment group relative to the control group can be interpreted as causal impacts of the intervention. The DD model can be formally represented as follows: !\"#$%&'()*=,-+,/01'2#()+,34%5#*+,601'2#()\u00d74%5#*+,89()*+,:;)*+<)+=*+>()* Where !\"#$%&'()* represents the outcome of interest to be estimated for individual i living in state/region s at time t. 01'2# is an indicator for assignment to the treatment group and 4%5# an indicator for the post-intervention period. The interaction term, 01'2#()\u00d74%5#*, is the coefficient of interest and represents the effect of the intervention on the treatment group relative to the control group. Finally, 9 is a vector of individual characteristics such as age and sex, ; is a vector of state or region characteristics such as unemployment rates, < and = are state/region and time fixed effects, and > is an error term that captures unobserved factors associated with the outcome of interest. Most of the DD models will be estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), however we may employ nonlinear estimation techniques to account for relatively rare Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 22 outcomes. Table 2 below lists each outcome that we plan to analyze using the DD technique and the populations assigned to the treatment and control groups.

Non-OUD/SUD beneficiaries treated at IMDs: includes Medicaid beneficiaries treated at IMDs who do not have a diagnosis of OUD/SUD and are therefore subject to the IMD exclusion rule. We plan to use a propensity score matching technique to generate a control group of non-OUD/SUD IMD patients with characteristics similar to those with an OUD/SUD diagnosis. 2. OUD/SUD beneficiaries in regions with high pre-demonstration MAT use: MAT use for OUD/SUD varies geographically across the state of Louisiana. For example, Orleans Parish has 182 certified MAT prescribers, while 40 parishes have fewer than 5 MAT prescribers and 9 parishes have 0 prescribers.3 We propose to create a control group composed of Medicaid OUD/SUD beneficiaries in regions with high pre-demonstration MAT use, as these individuals would be relatively less impacted by the demonstration's efforts to increase MAT use. Geographic regions would likely be delineated at the zip code or parish level depending on the sample size and high/low MAT use will be defined based on quartile of per-capita MAT claims. 3. Certified dispensers in control states: control states will include those states that have expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA, but have not received approval for an SUD Section 1115 Demonstration Waiver. Additionally, we will confirm whether pre- 3 See the Louisiana Section 1115 Demonstration Waiver Implementation Plan for a complete count of MAT prescribers by parish. Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 23 demonstration trends in outcomes for Louisiana and the control states are similar and may alter the combination of control states based on these trends. 4. Non-OUD/SUD beneficiaries: includes Medicaid beneficiaries without an OUD/SUD diagnosis. We plan to use a propensity score matching technique to generate a control group of non-OUD/SUD beneficiaries with characteristics similar to those with an OUD/SUD diagnosis. We will also compare average resource utilization by diagnosis to eliminate beneficiaries from the control group who visit the ED or are admitted to the hospital with conditions that tend to result in much higher or much lower utilization compared to OUD/SUD treatments. 5. Decedents in control states: control states will include those states that have expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA, but have not received approval for an SUD Section 1115 Demonstration Waiver. Additionally, we will confirm whether pre-demonstration trends in outcomes for Louisiana and the control states are similar and may alter the combination of control states based on these trends. For cases where no appropriate control group can be defined, we will instead rely on either an interrupted time series analysis or a simple pre/post analysis. The interrupted time series model can be described as follows: !\"#$%&'(*=,-+,/0?&'*+,3@&AB'&'C#*+,60?&'*\u00d7@&AB'&'C#*+,89()*+,:;)*+<)+>()* Where 0?&' is a continuous measure of time denoted in either year, year-quarter, or month depending on sample sizes. @&AB'&'C# is an indicator for the implementation of a demonstration milestone meant to impact the outcome in question and measures any break in trend associated with the intervention. The interaction term, 0?&'*\u00d7@&AB'&'C#* captures any change in to the slope of the trend that occurred after the intervention. All other variables remain as previously defined. Finally, in a small number of cases, neither a DD or ITS will be feasible due to a lack of control group and time-series data. In these cases, we will use a simple pre/post comparison of mean changes and test for statistical significance between the pre- and post-period using t-tests or chi-square tests depending on the outcome to be analyzed. Qualitative methods 1. Evaluation methodology The evaluation will use qualitative methods to examine the reasons why the expected impacts were or were not observed. Qualitative data collection will be informed by findings from a preliminary analysis of quantitative indicators listed in the summary table which will be conducted after the first 12 months of the intervention. The methodology used to assess each research question is as follows: Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 24 a. Does the demonstration increase access to and utilization of SUD treatment centers? In-depth interviews will be conducted with inpatient and outpatient treatment providers who began offering evidence-based treatment/MAT after the start of the intervention, and those who did not. The interviews will discuss whether the SUD 1115 waiver impacted the decision to begin offering treatment, and the barriers the offering evidence-based treatment that remain. b. Did use of medically-inappropriate care including emergency department and hospital care for OUD/SUD decline as a result of the demonstration? Key informant interviews with primary care/treatment providers and ED managers will be conducted. If preliminary data shows that inappropriate care has declined, the interviews will explore the mechanisms by which the SUD 1115 waiver had an impact. If inappropriate care has not declined, interviews will explore the reasons why the SUD 1115 wavier has not had an impact and the barriers to reducing inappropriate care. c. Did care-coordination improve as a result of the demonstration? A survey will be administered to treatment facilities after the first year of the demonstration (February/March 2019) and repeated annually over the course of the demonstration. The survey will assess the changes in capacity for care coordination of each facility before and after the intervention. d. Did health outcomes for Medicaid beneficiaries with OUD/SUD improve as a result of the demonstration? Key informant interviews with primary care/treatment providers and local health officials will be conducted. If preliminary data shows that health outcomes are improving, the discussions will focus on the mechanisms by which the SUD 1115 waiver had an impact. If not, the discussions will center on the reasons why this expected impact has not been observed. e. Target and comparison populations. The types and numbers of respondents, as well as the selection methodology, is detailed in the table below. In most cases, two respondents will be selected from each of Louisiana's nine LDH regions, to ensure regional representation.

Evaluation period Qualitative data will be collected during Year 3 of the intervention. g. Data sources Data will be collected through in-depth and key informant interviews with stakeholders within the health system. Interviews will be audio recorded with the respondent's permission. If no permission is given, the interviewer and a research assistant will take detailed notes. Audio recordings will be transcribed. h. Analytic methods Two members of the research staff will code a subset of the data, then develop a common set of codes. Each research staff member will code the full data set and inter-rater reliability will be calculated. Major discrepancies in coding will be resolved between the research staff members. Data will be coded for themes based on the research questions and triangulated with findings from the quantitative analysis. The analysis will describe areas of consensus among respondents, as well as areas in which there were differing viewpoints. Findings will be presented with illustrative quotations. Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 27 D. Methodological Limitations D.1 Quantitative Limitations There are two important limitations of the DD design that we propose to use throughout this evaluation. The first limitation involves simultaneous changes in OUD/SUD policy that overlap with the waiver demonstration. For example, if the state or local municipalities enact policies aimed at curbing opioid overdose that are concurrent with the implementation of the demonstration measures, then it would be difficult to untangle the relative impact of the two interventions on overdose rates. This is a valid concern as several opioid-related policies have taken effect throughout Louisiana recently. In instances where these policies vary geographically, we can leverage this variation to separate demonstration impacts from alternate policy impacts. However, concurrent policy adoption remains a limitation of the DD methodology. Another necessary assumption for the validity of the DD design is that outcomes for the treatment and control groups would have continued to trend in a similar fashion in the absence of changes associated with the demonstration. This assumption is untestable, as it is impossible to observe the treatment group in the untreated state during the post-treatment period; however, evidence that these two groups followed similar trends in the outcome variable in the pre-demonstration period lends credence to the DD estimation strategy. We will examine evidence of parallel pre-period trends before implementing our DD models. Both the ITS and pre/post methods suffer from similar limitations. In neither case is a control group employed to account for changes common to both those affected by the demonstration and those who are unaffected. Therefore, these methods are less rigorous than a DD analysis. Because of its reliance on time-series data, the ITS can provide a stronger claim at identifying causal effects than a simple pre/post analysis. However, like the DD, both methods can also be confounded by concurrent policy changes unrelated to the demonstration. D.2 Qualitative Limitations Though not a limitation, it should be noted that the results of the qualitative analysis will not be statistically representative. However, the findings derived from interviews with multiple subjects across geographic areas will produce information which can be generalized to other settings.

Personal Statement I am an Associate Professor in the department of Global Health Management & Policy of Tulane University's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. My research has focused on the organizational impact of health information systems, primarily in hospitals in the US, and I have recently begun investigating the performance of patient-centered medical homes and accountable care organizations. Most of this work involves the use of large secondary data sets and the conduct of research at the organizational level. I have experience working on the validation of measures of both CPOE and EHR adoption and implementation, which is well suited to this project. I also have experience in funded evaluation work as a co-evaluator of phase II of the Health Information Security and Privacy Collaboration (HISPC) Project, as the principle investigator on the external evaluation of the Louisiana Long-term Care Real Choice Systems Transformation Grant, through the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, as the PI for an evaluation of an electronic health record implementation in Mexico, funded by the Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 30 MEASURE Evaluation project of USAID, as the PI for the evaluation of the Louisiana Health Information Exchange, among other projects. 1.

Begun Award for Excellence in Doctoral Studies in Health Administration, Department of Health Administration, Virginia Commonwealth University. C. Contribution to Science 1. My primary contribution is in the area of health information technology (HIT) adoption and use in hospitals, and the effect of hospital HIT adoption and use on quality, safety, and other performance outcomes. I have developed this stream of research in the context of the two seminal IOM reports on safety and quality\u2014To Err is Human and Crossing he Quality Chasm\u2014and the incentives programs implemented in the HITECH Act. Key findings from this work indicate that achieving quality and safety gains is not an inherent property of HIT, but that there are other factors that work with the technology to achieve the desired outcomes. Identifying those factors remains a high priority. I believe this work has influenced how other researchers, practitioners, and policy makers think about the role of HIT in improving hospital performance. My role in this work has been as a primary investigator or co-investigator in collaboration with a relatively small group of colleagues. a. Burke, D. E., Wang, B., Wan, T. T. H., & Diana, M. L.

Kazley, A. S., Diana, M. L., & Menachemi, N. (2012). Is EHR Use Associated with Patient Satisfaction in Hospitals? Health Care Management Review, 37(1), 23-30. 2. A related contribution to the adoption and use of HIT in hospitals stream of research is on the measurement of HIT adoption and use. My interest in the measurement issue arose from difficulties my colleagues and I encountered in examining the effects of HIT adoption and use. Put simply, the available data sources for examining electronic health record (EHR) adoption and use were rudimentary, and data on components of an EHR, like computerized provider order entry (CPOE) were also, and beyond CPOE virtually non-existent, with the single exception of the Health Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) data. I believe the work we did in examining the reliability, validity, and consistency of various measures has contributed to the growing sophistication of measures of HIT adoption and use, but I also believe there is still much work to be done in this area. a.

A third area of research I am developing in collaboration with doctoral students and junior colleagues is examining the performance of new models of health care delivery, specifically patient-centered medical homes (PCMH) and accountable care organizations (ACO). There is a clear relationship between this line of inquiry and my first area, since both of these care models rely on a robust HIT infrastructure to achieve the proposed performance improvements in terms of improved quality, improved care coordination, greater access, and reduced costs. We are in the early stages of this work, but we already have contributed some significant knowledge to the growing literature in this area. I anticipate this line of research to continue to grow. a.

Upjohn Institute for Employment Research Early Career Research Award C. Contributions to Science Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 36 My contributions to the field are concentrated in three general areas of study: 1. Health policy evaluation - My current research efforts are primarily focused on the analysis of recent policy interventions that aim to improve population health. I have a strong interest in evaluating the effects on health and labor market outcomes of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion and have documented heterogeneous impacts of the expansion across race and ethnicity. I am currently a Co-Investigator on a project sponsored by the State of Louisiana to document changes in health care access and outcomes associated with the state's Medicaid expansion in 2016. Examining a health insurance expansion in a developing country setting, my coauthors and I found evidence of substitution away from traditional forms of health care and towards the use of modern care. These papers complement and add to a body of research concerning the relationship between insurance expansions and the use of care. In a separate policy evaluation, my coauthor and I presented the first evidence on the effectiveness of donor registry laws and first-person consent legislation on the supply of deceased organ donors. This represents a critical area of study as the demand for transplantable organs has far surpassed the available supply and continues to grow at a steep rate. I am in the process of continuing my work on organ failure by examining the effect of recent legislation that penalizes dialysis facilities for poor patient outcomes. Finally, along with Dr. Pesko, I have recently finished conducting an evaluation of state and local paid sick leave mandates in the U.S. Little is known about the health and labor market effects of paid sick leave mandates in the U.S. setting and, therefore, this work has the potential to provide a significant contribution to an emerging policy debate as well as provide support for the successful completion of the proposed research project. a.

Health determinants and substance abuse - My research in this area initially addressed links between adolescent and adult health and explored factors that contributed to substance abuse early in life. These studies contributed to a growing body of evidence on the role of individual non-cognitive factors and external influences in adolescence on health outcomes later in life. Building on these earlier studies, I have analyzed the relationship between cigarette taxes and tobacco use for adults and conducted an examination of the mechanisms underlying addiction and substance use. These are certainly timely issues and will continue to be an area of focus as I advance in my career. a. Kaestner, R. & Callison, K. (2011).

Health care use and the organization of health insurance markets - My interest in the organizational aspects of health care delivery developed early-on in my research career. My dissertation work considered the implications of geographic variation in health care expenditures and I have continued to investigate this topic. Relatedly, I have explored the interaction between health insurance coverage, reimbursement levels, and the use of health care services. I am particularly interested in the role of private insurance plans in the financing of Medicare benefits, an area of increasing importance as the share of privately enrolled Medicare beneficiaries continues to grow. Finally, my work has extended to interdisciplinary efforts to evaluate care coordination interventions for highly complex hospital patients. a. Callison, K. (2016).

Personal Statement My training, expertise, and experience both in health services delivery and qualitative research qualify me to complete this research project. I have a broad background in health services research, particularly in the areas of service quality and health workforce. I have designed, implemented, and published research involving primary qualitative data collection through key informant and in-depth interviews with health service providers and patients. I have experience using qualitative findings to build theory and inform interventions. Examples of my work include a study examining provider satisfaction and motivation in the Democratic Republic of Congo using interviews and focus groups, for which I am the Principle Investigator, an analysis of dissatisfaction in the public health workforce in the United States based on qualitative survey data, and an evaluation of the Louisiana Medicaid expansion involving physician and beneficiary interviews.

Contributions to Science 1. Identification of Strategies that Increase Health Service Utilization in Post-Conflict Settings. Through my work in the Democratic Republic in Congo, I am studying ways in which access to quality health services can be promoted in post-conflict settings. I began by ascertaining the importance of quality to these populations; my dissertation focused on the relationship between quality and utilization of maternal health services. I found that patients assess service quality accurately when they are exposed to the aspect of quality and understand its importance, and that higher quality is associated with higher utilization of antenatal care. I am currently evaluating the potential for communities to hold providers accountable for service quality; preliminary findings show success at the local level. a.

Discovery of Factors Motivating Retention of Public Health Workforce. I have published several papers examining the factors that matter in the recruitment and retention of the public health workforce. This work has shown that contrary to conventional thinking, salary level is less important to recruitment and retention than other largely modifiable factors such as having a variety of job tasks and opportunities for training and growth. Findings also indicate that public health workers associate dissatisfying factors such as heavy workloads and a lack of training with their abilities to provide high-quality services. a.

Contributions to Science 1. Natural Experiments used to Evaluate Health Policy Changes Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 44 As an applied econometrician I have led or coauthored several studies that exploit natural experiments to examine the health impacts of policy changes. I have exploited variation in playoff success to determine the impacts of National Football League teams on local influenza mortality. I used a differences-in-differences framework to examine this question. I have used contingent choice methods to quantify the financial impacts of policies restricting access to nasal decongestants in pharmacies. I have also used policy-induced variation in economic sanctions induced by the Clean Air Act to examine the impacts of pollution fetal and maternal health. This study used a regression discontinuity design that exploited the fact that the EPA established thresholds for air pollution and imposed sanctions on counties over those thresholds. I have extensive experience applying natural experiments to a variety of questions. a. Stoecker, C, Sanders, NJ, & Barreca, A.

Cost-effectiveness of Reducing Vaccine Schedules for Children My early publications directly addressed the fact that the United States does not have a cost-effective recommended vaccination schedule for pneumococcal vaccine for children. While many other industrialized countries use a 3 dose schedule, the United States spends approximately $500 million per year on a 4th dose that dose very little to improve outcomes. In order to investigate this I developed a model to calculate pneumococcal disease incidence and costs for children. The model tracked outcomes and QALYs through life expectancy. As the model was developed we realized the key input would be the relative effectiveness of the two dosage schedules against otitis media. As no studies had previously examined this we performed propensity score matching on insurance claims data to get a better estimate of the impact of a reduced dose schedule. This work has sparked numerous policy discussions within CDC and FDA and other regulatory agencies that are currently ongoing. I developed the cost-effectiveness model, performed the propensity score matching, and served as the primary investigator for these studies. a.

Cost-effectiveness of Expanded Vaccination Recommendations for Adults Adults experienced large declines in incidence of pneumococcal disease caused by serotypes included in the conjugate vaccine. My next projects investigated the cost-effectiveness of including the conjugate vaccine for adults compared to relying on herd immunity protections conferred to adults by the childhood vaccination program. The first study found introducing the vaccine for a particularly susceptible population of adults was cost-saving. After new data emerged on the effectiveness of the vaccine against Proposed Evaluation of the State of Louisiana Substance Use Disorder Section 1115 Demonstration 45 pneumococcal pneumonia emerged, we conducted cost-effectiveness analysis for the general adult population. We found a new recommended vaccine schedule would be cost-effective in the short term, but in the long-term the costs were very high compared to the benefits. Both of these studies led to changes in the recommended vaccine schedule for adults, with the recommendation that the cost-effectiveness of the recommendation for the general population be regularly monitored. I helped develop the cost-effectiveness model for susceptible adults, and developed the model for the general adult population. I served as primary investigator for the study on the general adult population and co-primary investigator on the study of particularly susceptible adults. a.
