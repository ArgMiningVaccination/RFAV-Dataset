We wish to convey to you the \"osteopathic difference, \" that is, the difference it makes to attend an osteopathic medical school versus an allo - pathic medical school. Even after only one year of study, we could not imagine not being able to touch or interact with patients in the osteopathic manner throughout our training and future clinical practice. Osteopathic manipu - lative medicine and the art of palpation have truly become integral and meaningful parts of our medical training. In writing this guidebook, our goal is not to impose our personal opinions about osteopathic medicine on you, but rather to present an overview of the profession that has been reviewed by our colleagues and professors and includes pertinent findings obtained through a systematic literature review of reputable sources. The guidebook is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is an overview of what osteopathic medicine is and what a DO does. Chapter 2 delves into the philosophy and history of osteopathic medicine, from its modest U.S. ori - gins to its widespread reach all around the world today. Chapter 3 consists of an outline of the different techniques involved in osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) and an FAQ section concerning OMM. Finally, in Chapter 4, we discuss the growing opportunities available for osteopathic medical students and DOs. By the time you finish reading this guide, you should have a basic understanding of what osteopathic medicine is, and perhaps a desire to pursue it in the future. Our hope is that this knowledge will be carried on to your friends, family, classmates, co-workers and colleagues, thereby raising awareness of the osteopathic medical profession in your respective communities.

Updated May 2014.Introduction The decision to enter medical school is undoubt - edly one of the most important decisions in a phy - sician's life. Yet, the majority of Americans are not aware that two different medical schools of thought exist in the United States today: allopathic medicine and osteo - pathic medicine. While allopathic medical doctors, MDs, are almost universally recognized as being fully licensed physicians, most Americans would have difficulty defining an osteopathic physician (DO). In fact, many patients visit DOs every day without realizing they are receiving medical care from an osteopathic physician. This short text was prepared as a guide to osteopathic medicine for the aspiring physician. When we began con - sidering application to medical schools, neither of us had heard of the DO degree or osteopathic medicine. And even when we had been exposed to osteopathic medicine, we didn't have the time to properly educate ourselves; we were too busy studying for the MCAT, gathering letters of reference and writing personal statements - not to men - tion attending classes, volunteering, shadowing, working part-time and holding several leadership positions. We were basically doing anything and everything we could to make ourselves strong candidates for medical schools. In writing this guidebook, our goal is to give the prospective or current medical school student (and anyone else who might be interested) a convenient package with which to understand osteopathic medicine. You may be thinking to yourself, \"What can two second-year medical students tell me that I don't already know?\" While we realize that we still have infinitely more to learn about the osteopathic approach to medicine (and medicine in general), we do currently attend an osteo - pathic medical school. Perhaps more important, we were in your position not too long ago, and we remember very clearly what it was like to be a \"pre-med\" student. We hope that because of this, we can better relate to some of your concerns than would, for instance, someone with more 2 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Back to Table of Contents their MD school of choice, many applicants choose to apply only to osteopathic schools based on prior contact with the profession or an interest in primary care. Still others choose to attend a DO school even after gaining admission to MD schools because of the \"osteopathic difference. \" 6. MYTH: \"Osteopaths\" are the same thing as \"osteopathic physicians. \" FACT: Both American osteopathic physicians and non-U.S. osteopaths call themselves DOs. American practitioners are Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine, and European practitioners have a Diploma of Oste - opathy. There is, thus, some confusion regarding the difference between U.S osteopathic physicians and osteopaths trained in other countries. Osteopaths (the term used for foreign-trained practitioners who prac - tice osteopathic manipulation) are not physicians. Their training focuses on the musculoskeletal system and they are not licensed to prescribe medications or perform surgeries. They are trained primarily in the practice of osteopathic manipulative techniques. Conversely, U.S.-trained osteopathic physicians are fully licensed to practice the entire scope of modern medicine. Although you may hear U.S.-trained osteo - pathic physicians being referred to as osteopaths, prefer the term \"osteopathic physician\" prac - ticing osteopathic medicine in themselves from foreign-trained osteopaths prac - ticing osteopathy .1 This confusion has resulted in some reluctance in countries abroad to accept DOs as fully licensed phy - sicians. Nevertheless, U.S.-trained DOs currently hold full medical practice rights in over 65 countries, and restricted rights in a few others. 2 1 Schierhorn C.

Retrieved May 7, 2014 from http://www.osteopathic. org/inside-aoa/development/international-osteopathic-medi - cine/Pages/international-practice-rights-map.aspxMyth or Fact? In this section, we discuss some of the most common misconceptions about osteopathic medicine that exist among the general public and even among some members of the medical profession. 1. MYTH: DOs are not \"real doctors. \" FACT: U.S.-trained DOs can prescribe medications, perform surgery, and pursue medical specialties in the same manner that MDs do. 2. MYTH: DOs have limited practice rights. FACT: In the United States, DOs and MDs are held equally in the eyes of the law and thus have full prac - tice rights in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. However, only U.S.-trained DOs are considered full physicians (along with MDs) in the United States. 3. MYTH: Osteopathic medicine is a drugless form of medicine. FACT: Osteopathic medicine's founder, Andrew Taylor Still, originally intended for his form of medicine to uti - lize only a select few medications in certain situations at its conception in the 1800s. However, osteopathic medi - cine is science-based and has greatly evolved since then. During its evolution, osteopathic medicine has incor - porated varied modalities of care, including (but not limited to) pharmaceutical drugs. Since 1929, pharma - cology and the use of prescription medication have been taught in all osteopathic medical schools. 4. MYTH: DOs are similar to chiropractors. FACT: While osteopathic manipulative medicine bears some similarity to chiropractic, the two fields of health care represent completely different and separate schools of thought and practice, and have since each was conceived in the late 1800s. A detailed breakdown of the differences between osteopathic physicians and chiropractors is provided in Chapter 3 . 5. MYTH: DOs are just doctors who couldn't get into MD schools. FACT: While some osteopathic medical students choose a DO school after being denied admission to A Brief Guide to Osteopathic Medicine - For Students, By Students 3 Back to Table of Contents medicine that they desire; such specialties range from primary care, such as pediatrics, internal medicine and family practice, to more specialized fields such as surgery, radiology, and anesthesiology. Both MDs and DOs can serve in all branches of the military service, and the two professions they represent are seen equally in the eyes of the law.2 So what makes osteopathic medicine different? First of all, osteopathic medicine, as an establishment and a profession, is very much separate from the allopathic med - ical profession. Accreditation organizations differ between the two professions. The American Osteopathic Associ - ation (AOA) serves as the primary certifying body and accreditation agency for health care facilities and graduate medical education (GME), and the AOA Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) accredits the osteopathic medical colleges. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME, which also accredits dual residency programs) and the Liaison Com - mittee on Medical Education (LCME) serve allopathic medicine in a similar fashion. In addition, just as there are specifically osteopathic colleges, there are osteopathic board examinations, residency programs, hospitals, pro - fessional associations, and scientific journals. Depending on the state, boards granting medical licensure may be mixed (DO and MD) or separate, with distinct osteopathic boards handling only DO licensure.7 Due to the dispro - portionate geographic distribution of DOs in the United States, which tends to be most concentrated the Midwest and Northeast, the presence of osteopathic medicine is greater in some states than others. States with larger DO populations are more likely to have separate osteopathic licensing boards than those with smaller DO populations. But what really distinguishes osteopathic medicine is the unifying approach and philosophy by which its physi - cians are guided in their practice of medicine. DOs pride themselves on their emphasis on preventive medicine, a patient-centered, holistic approach to care, and patient empowerment to strive toward the body's natural, optimal state of structure/function, and self-healing and health. They also utilize diagnosis of and manual manipulation of the neuromusculoskeletal system and stress its inter - connectedness with every other organ system in the body. The belief in the \"osteopathic difference\" is quite wide - spread among osteopathic physicians. In fact, a random national mail survey of 950 osteopathic physicians found that a majority (59 percent) of respondents believed that their manner of practice as a DO was different from that of MDs. Furthermore, 72 percent of these 560 respondents There are two types of fully licensed medical doc - tors in the United States: MDs and DOs. While the MD degree stands for \"Doctor of Medicine, \" the DO degree stands for \"Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. \" DOs practice osteopathic medicine, which represents a school of medical thought first introduced by Dr. Andrew Taylor Still in 1874. Osteopathic medicine encompasses a uni - fying philosophy and approach to patient care, as well as a system of diagnosis and treatment through the use of hands-on, manual manipulative medicine. There exists a great deal of similarity between osteo - pathic medicine and what is known as \"allopathic\" (MD) medicine. Osteopathic physicians work alongside their MD counterparts in the same hospitals, private practices, and academic institutions. Like MDs, DOs are licensed to practice medicine, perform surgery, and prescribe med - ications in all 50 states. They may enter any specialty of Chapter 1 What is a DO? \"Something Extra, Not Something Else\" Fast Facts: There are currently over 73,000 osteopathic physicians in practice in the United States.1 More than 20 percent of new medical students in the United States are training to be osteo - pathic physicians.2 During the 2014-2015 academic year, there were more than 24,500 osteopathic medical students in training.2 More than 6,700 new medical students began their training as osteopathic physicians in fall 2014.3 There were more than 18,000 applicants to osteopathic medical colleges for the 2014-2015 entering medical school class.2 Osteopathic physicians comprise roughly 7 percent of the practicing physician population in the United States, but account for 16 percent of the total number of patient visits in com - munities with small populations (fewer than 2,500).24 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Back to Table of Contents Chapter 1: What is a DO? cited distinctions in their approach to medical care, such as the use of osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM), a caring doctor-patient relationship, and a hands-on style of treatment and diagnosis, as main distinguishing factors.8 The 2003 Maine Osteopathic Outcomes Study (MOOS) set out to answer the question, \"Do osteopathic physicians differ in patient interaction from allopathic physicians?\" Researchers took audio-recordings of patient visits with both MDs and DOs and used a 26-item index of physician-patient communications considered to be reflective of modern osteopathic principles to judge the hypothesized difference in patient interaction. The study found that the DOs demonstrated a more personal, \"osteo - pathic\" communication style based on the 26-item index than did the MDs. The DOs were significantly more likely to use the patient's first name, discuss preventive mea - sures, and discuss the patient's emotional state, family life, and social activities. Despite the study being small (18 par - ticipant physicians and 54 patient visits total), it was con - ducted in a double-blind fashion and offers important insights into the distinction between DOs and MDs.9 Increasingly, however, the lines between DO and MD are becoming blurred. In medicine today, \"the training, practice, credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians are virtually indistinguishable from those of allopathic physicians, with four years of osteo - pathic medical school followed by specialty and sub - specialty training and [board] certification. \"10 Bob Jones, Figure 1-1.

Makes , once proclaimed, \"Osteopathic medicine is something extra, not something else. \"11 He was referring to the additional 200 - 300 hours of osteopathic-specific instruction that osteopathic medical students receive in conjunction with coursework equiva - lent to that of their allopathic counterparts.2 The osteopathic curriculum consists of all the tra - ditional disciplines: anatomy, behavioral science, bio - chemistry, biostatistics, embryology, genetics, histology, immunology, microbiology, Figure 1-1 ). Osteo - pathic medical students often study the same textbooks used in allopathic schools, and are taught by DOs as well as MDs.12 However, unlike their allopathic counterparts, osteopathic students also spend at least 200 hours of pre - clinical education learning about the history of osteo - pathic medicine, the core osteopathic principles and phi - losophies, and OMM.2 After attending medical school, which is usually composed of two years of in-classroom didactic courses followed by two years of clinical rotations in office, clinic, and hospital settings, osteopathic physi - cians go on to complete three to eight years of residency, the length of which depends on the specialty the doctor elects to pursue (see Table 1-1 ). While MD students typi - cally rotate through large affiliated hospitals during their clinical years, osteopathic medical students are often exposed to a wider variety of clinical settings (i.e., hospitals of varying size, community-based clinics, etc.).

They are less likely to place as much emphasis on Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) scores and/or GPAs as allopathic schools do.12 These differing criteria may explain some of the existing disparities in average admissions statis - tics between admitted students of osteopathic med - ical schools and those of allopathic medical schools. The 19,517 matriculating allopathic students in 2012 had an average combined MCAT score of 31.2 (Physical Science: 10.5, Verbal Reasoning: 9.8, Biological Science: 10.9) and average GPAs of 3.63, 3.75, and 3.68 for science, non- science, and total, respectively.15 In contrast, the same year, the 5,464 matriculating osteopathic medical students had an 8.74, VR: GPAs of 3.37, 3.59, and 3.49, respectively.16 The other major factor contributing to this disparity is the difference in the actual applicant pools. Currently, the majority of medical school applicants do not apply to osteopathic medical programs, likely due to a general lack of accessible and reliable information concerning osteo - pathic medicine. Many applicants have not had any signif -Producing competent primary care physicians , in par - ticular, is part of the mission statement of many, if not all, U.S. osteopathic medical schools. According to the 2014 U.S. News and World Report, a popular source of medical school rankings, osteopathic medical schools rank among the top producers of primary care doctors in the nation, with Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine (MSUCOM) being one of the ten top-ranked medical school in this category.13 Consequently, some cur - ricula may place a greater emphasis on such skills as bed - side manner, interviewing and building the physician- patient relationship. These schools do not in any way force students to go into primary care - many students simply choose to do so.14 Osteopathic medical schools also use differing cri - teria when selecting candidates to interview and/or extending offers of admission. For example, in the eval - uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates' interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy. They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo - pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) Doctor of Medicine (MD) Pre-medical Requirements Varies by school; most often: General Chemistry: 2 semesters/3 quarters (with laboratories) General Biology: 2 semesters/3 quarters (with laboratories) Organic Chemistry: 2 semesters/3 quarters (with laboratories) General Physics: 2 semesters/3 quarters (with laboratories) Often additional Mathematics and/or English and Writing courses may also be required Standardized Admissions ExaminationMedical College Admissions Test (MCAT) Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) Years of medical school 4 4 Medical Licensing Exams: Step 1 COMLEX Level 1 required; USMLE Step 1 optionalUSMLE Step 1 required Step 2 COMLEX Level 2 required; USMLE Step 2 optionalUSMLE Step 2 required Step 3 COMLEX Level 3 required for some statest USMLE Step 3 optionalUSMLE Step 3 required Residency Choice of one of the following: ACGME AOA Parallel/Dually Accredited allopathic (ABMS) medical specialty boardsAllopathic (ABMS) medical specialty boards Some states require the first year of residency (PGY-1) be AOA-approved; Resolution 42. t These states are: California, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Michigan, Oklahoma, Florida, and Vermont.

From our personal experience, this misinformation can sometimes perpetuate misconcep - tions, including the perception that osteopathic schools serve primarily as a \"Plan B\" rather than as an equally viable alternative to allopathic schools. In fact, in a survey conducted by AACOM in which 3,215 respondents of 14,943 students who applied during the 2012 AACOMAS application cycle were asked to rank their top reasons for matriculating at a particular medical school (osteopathic or allopathic), an MD student's prefer - ence of having an MD over a DO degree was ranked below geographic location. The chart below presents the possible reasons for matriculation that were listed in the survey: Only a minority of the overall U.S. population is actually aware of the existence of DOs. In a national, random digit-dialing telephone survey of 499 adult, non- institutionalized, household respondents conducted in 2000, only 46 percent were aware of osteopathic physi - cians, while 16 percent knew they had actually visited a DO and a mere 7 percent knew they were current patients of a DO. Awareness was found to be directly associated with age, education, race, and Midwest residence (prob - ably due to osteopathic medicine's Midwest origins).17 Thus, young adults, who represent the majority of the med - ical school application pool, are thought to have a lower awareness of osteopathic medicine. However, the results of OSTEOSURV 2010, the most recent update to this decen - nial national survey, are set to be released later this year and may reflect the recent upsurge in the osteopathic phy - sician population (see Figure 2-1 ). While the admissions criteria and statistics may differ between osteopathic and allopathic medical schools, the student demographics in the two professions are fairly similar in terms of race/ethnicity, and are virtually iden - tical in terms of sex, as detailed in Figure 1-2 , Table 1-2 , Figure 1-3 , and Table 1-3 .18, 19, 20 However, racial minori - ties are consistently underrepresented in the medical pro - fession, and this issue seems to be more pronounced in the osteopathic medical student population. The reasons for this are complex, but one potential factor may be that osteopathic medical schools have less funding devoted to scholarships for economically disadvantaged students.

These statistics are simply statistics and do not in any way reflect bias against minorities within the osteopathic medical profession. Also, while osteo - pathic medical students have historically been older than their allopathic counterparts, the average age of students matriculating into osteopathic schools seems to be getting progressively younger every year. In 2012, it was 25 years old, not much older than the average age of MD school matriculants in the same year, which was 24.22, 23 If becoming a physician is your goal, the statistics and information provided above should be enough to show that there are indeed two similar, legitimate paths you can take to become trained as a physician in the United States. As we have also pointed out, however, there are several fundamental differences between allopathic and osteo - pathic education and practice. In the next chapter, we will discuss the history and origin of osteopathic philosophy in order to explain how this profession's foundation was laid over a century ago.

A Brief Guide to Osteopathic Medicine - For Students, By Students 9 Back to Table of Contents Chapter 2 The Philosophy and History of Osteopathic Medicine The DO Difference: Not Just Manipulative Medicine to provide patients with the tools they need to restore and maintain their natural, self-healing state. The four major tenets of the osteopathic medical philosophy are listed and briefly explained below: 2, 3 1. The body is completely united; the person is a fully inte - grated being of body, mind and spirit. No single part of the body functions independently. Each separate part is interconnected with all others and serves to benefit the collective whole of the person. Alterations in any part of the system, including an individual's mental and spiritual health, affect the function of the body as a whole and all other parts therein. 2. The body is capable of self-regulation, self-healing, and health-maintenance. Health is the natural state of the body, and the body possesses complex, homeo - static, self-regulatory mechanisms that it uses to heal itself from injury. In times of disease, when a part of the body is functioning sub-optimally, other parts of the body come out of their natural state of health in order to compensate for the dysfunction. During this compensatory process, however, new dysfunctions may arise. Osteopathic physicians must work to adjust the body so as to realign its parts back to normal. Osteopathic manipulative medicine aims to restore the body's self-healing capacity by decreasing allo - static load, or the physiologic effects of chronic bodily stresses,1 and enhancing the immune system. 3. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated. The structure of a body part governs its function, and thus abnormal structure manifests as dysfunction. Func - tion also governs structure. In addition, if the body's overall structure is suboptimal, its functioning and capacity for self-healing will be inhibited as well. 4. Rational treatment is based on an understanding of these three aforementioned principles. These basic osteopathic tenets permeate all aspects of health maintenance and disease prevention and treatment. The osteopathic physician examines, diagnoses, and treats patients according to these principles. \"The human body is a machine run by the unseen force called life, and that it may be run harmoniously it is necessary that there be liberty of blood, nerves, and arteries from their generating point to their destination. \" - Dr. Andrew Taylor Still1 There are two main distinctions between osteopathic and allopathic physicians. The first, more obvious difference lies in the osteopathic physicians' use of osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). While OMM is most commonly known by the general public to treat neuromusculoskeletal injury, DOs may utilize it in their diagnosis and treatment of disease involving internal organs and all other parts of the body as well. The other, more subtle - and arguably more important - distinction between the two professions is that osteopathic medicine offers a concise philosophy on which all clinical practice is based. Central to this philosophy is the belief that the body has an inherent healing mechanism that allows it to maintain health, resist illness, and recover from disease processes. The goal of osteopathic medical treatment is Fast Facts: Osteopathic medicine was founded in 1874 by Dr. Andrew Taylor Still. The American Osteopathic Association (AOA) defines osteopathic medicine as \"a complete system of health care with a philosophy that combines the needs of the patient with the current practice of medicine. \"1 10 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Back to Table of Contents Chapter 2: The Philosophy and History of Osteopathic Medicine osteopathic medicine. Osteopathic medicine was born in a time when many different approaches to medicine existed, some of them more rational than others. Indeed, common medical practices during this era included bloodletting and pharmacological use of toxic chemicals such as mer - cury and arsenic. Most of the drugs that are widely avail - able today either had not been discovered or were not commonly recognized in Dr. Still's day. For example, Bayer did not patent aspirin until 1899, and it was not until 1935 that the first antibiotics (Sulfa drugs) became widely avail - able.4 Thus, it was only natural that other schools of med - ical thought sought to challenge orthodox practice. Home - opathy, one of the largest of these alternative schools, rejected common medical practice and instead based its remedies on empirical pharmacology and the concept of \"like cures like, \" which stated that a drug whose physi - ological effects were most aligned with those of a partic - ular disease could then be used to treat said disease. As much as 15 percent of the total U.S. physician popula - tion at this time adopted unorthodox approaches such as homeopathy. Perhaps also surprising is the fact that medical doctors during this time did not receive four years of schooling at an established medical school like they do today. Usually they were trained first through apprenticeship under a licensed physician. Some would then elect to study in a medical col - lege where they received brief schooling (frequently two years, the second being simply a review of the first). Modest Beginnings A .T. ST I L L first began studying medicine as an appren - tice under the direction of his father, who was a physician as well as a preacher and missionary. During his appren - ticeship, he treated Native American patients in the Kansas Territory. He then served in the Civil War as a surgeon. Later, he attended medical school at the College of Phy - sicians and Surgeons in Kansas City, Missouri, but only completed his first year of schooling due to his frustration with the redundancy of medical education at the time. In 1864, Dr. Still lost three children to spinal meningitis, and from that point forward, he began to seriously question the efficacy of orthodox medicine and to search for a novel approach to medical practice. Dr. Still's approach, which he termed \"osteopathy, \" a combination of the Greek word osteon , meaning bone, and pathology , the study of disease, was but one of many emerging alternatives to allopathic thought at the time. In order to counter the suspect nature of the drugs utilized by orthodox medical doctors, many drugless modalities were established. These included hydropathy, the prac - tice of drinking and immersing oneself in the purest water available, and magnetic healing, the use of magnets to restore bodily balance in terms of an invisible magnetic fluid. The latter, besides being drugless, also involved a Background WHILE OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE was conceived fairly recently (less than 150 years ago), its history is rich and thought-provoking. The history of the osteopathic pro - fession is central toward understanding the current state of osteopathic medicine and is thus taught as part of the osteopathic medical school curriculum. In fact, osteo - pathic medical students are often tested on the history and philosophy of osteopathic medicine, and are encour - aged to integrate osteopathic teachings into their approach as clinicians. The rest of this chapter offers a concise his - tory of osteopathic medicine. Much of the information we present here is derived from and elaborated on in much greater detail in Norman Gevitz's book, The DOs: Osteo - pathic Medicine in America , a must-read for anyone inter - ested in learning more about the osteopathic profession. Dr. Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917) was the founder of A Brief Guide to Osteopathic Medicine - For Students, By Students 11 Back to Table of Contents Chapter 2: The Philosophy and History of Osteopathic Medicine athy (ASO) in order to share his osteopathic manipula - tive treatments with others. In addition to learning to per - form osteopathic manipulations, the first student DOs were intensively trained in anatomy, which was central to Dr. Still's philosophy. The ASO was revolutionary not only with respect to its status as the first school of osteopathic medicine, but also in its anti-discrimination policy. Dr. Still's family was firmly abolitionist during the Civil War, and Dr. Still wanted to ensure that all qualified individuals, regardless of their race or sex, were given the opportunity to become physicians. Indeed, the ASO's inaugural class of 21 students contained six women,5 which was very pro - gressive for a time in which fewer than 5 percent of all U.S. medical students were women.6 Most female medical stu - dents attended women's medical colleges. The ASO was among only a few U.S. medical schools to admit women, and began doing so even before Johns Hopkins University, which began the practice the following year in 1893.7 During these years, the practice of osteopathic med - icine became much more widely known. More patients began to visit Kirksville seeking treatment, while journal - ists from all around the Midwest wrote articles proclaiming the efficacy of osteopathic medicine and citing patient tes - timonials as evidence. Still compiled these articles and published them in a Journal of Osteopathy , whose reader - ship increased from a few hundred in 1894 to more than 18,000 within two years. However, the osteopathic profes - sion's early success was not without opposition. Numerous efforts were made to halt Dr. Still's prac - tices, which were viewed as conflicting with the tradi - tional medical establishment. For instance, the Missouri State Medical Association and other medical soci - eties, including the homeopathic and eclectic societies, attempted to take legal action to limit the reach of osteo - pathic medicine. In response to pressures from the state philosophy of the body as a unit and the use of manual spinal manipulations. All three of these characteris - tics struck a chord with Dr. Still. Through his study of anatomy, Dr. Still appreci - ated the interdependence in structure and function that existed between different tissues. Instead of pro - posing that a magnetic fluid gave balance to the body, however, he posited that obstruction of blood flow was the origin of disease. He also combined aspects of magnetic healing with the established trade of \"bone - setting, \" or joint manipula - tion. He believed that the misplacement of spinal seg - ments, for example, could inter- fere with nerve and/or blood supply, thus manifesting as disease. In the early 1870s, Still began to apply these princi - ples to clinical practice and found that he could success - fully treat a number of diverse ailments, including asthma, headache, sciatica, and paralysis, by diagnosing and man - ually adjusting vertebral segments and other bony struc - tures without using drugs. Thus, in his practice, he rejected most of allopathic medicine's pharmacological agents except for a select few treatments, such as certain drugs in surgery and antidotes for poisonings. His rationale for minimizing the use of drugs was based on his distrust of medications with unknown mechanisms of action and those used simply as remedial agents to mask symptoms (e.g., opiates, cathartics, diuretics, purgatives). \"On June 22nd, 1874, I flung to the breeze the banner of Osteopathy, \" wrote Dr. Still. For many years, despite Dr. Still's successes in practice, his philosophy was rejected by many of his friends, relatives and colleagues. Even when he attempted to present his ideas at Baker University in Baldwin, Kansas, a school that he and his family had helped to found, he was denied. He eventually settled in Kirksville, Missouri, a small town with a population of 1,800. How - ever, because the patient population of Kirksville was lim - ited, Dr. Still took his practice all around the state in order to make ends meet and support his wife and children. Through seemingly miraculous treatment of diseases via osteopathy, Dr. Still began to gain a reputation as the so-called \"light - ning bone-setter, \" and people began to travel many miles hoping to be cured of various ailments. It was becoming obvious that Still needed to establish a permanent place of practice. In 1889, Dr. Still opened an infirmary in Kirksville, and in 1892, he founded the American School of Osteop - The American School of Osteopathy12 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Back to Table of Contents Chapter 2: The Philosophy and History of Osteopathic Medicine more emphasis on rural and underserved populations, more part-time faculty, and fewer affiliated hospitals, to name a few), but it ultimately led to lower pass rates on allopathic state licensing board exams and basic science board exams. In response to the results of the Flexner Report, osteo - pathic medical colleges expanded their facilities, added a mandatory fourth year of study, and integrated biological and chemical agents into the curriculum. By 1920, all grad - uates of approved osteopathic medical schools had com - pleted a four-year course of instruction. However, it was not until 1929 that osteopathic schools began to include pharmacology in their curricula. In the decades that fol - lowed, osteopathic medical schools continued to work toward keeping up with standards set by their allopathic counterparts. Osteopathic medical colleges focused on improving their prerequisites for admission, basic science cur - riculum, and clinical training. By 1940, the existing six accredited osteopathic institutions had raised their pre- requisite admissions requirements to two years of college coursework; by 1954, they had raised the requirements to three years. Commitment to the enhancement of a basic science curriculum was also a theme during this period, with significant increases in laboratory time, upgrades to laboratory facilities and equipment, and appointment of more qualified, full-time faculty. Clinical hour require - ments experienced tremendous increases, from an average of 862 hours in 1935 to 2,214 in 1959. Much of this progress would not have been possible without financial backing from tuition increases, the Osteopathic Progress Fund, greater federal support, and the Hill-Burton Act of 1946. With this rise in standards, DOs began to gain more headway in terms of professional recognition. The number of states in which DOs were eligible for full licensure rose from 26 in 1937 to 38 in 1960. Pass rates on medical and composite as well as basic science board examinations also made impressive strides. In the case of basic science exams, pass rates rose from 52.2 percent in 1942-1944 to 80.0 percent just a decade later; medical and composite exam pass rates experienced similar increases, rising from 62.6 percent in 1940-44 to 81.2 percent in 1955-59. However, despite this commendable progress, there continued to be a skewed public perception of what a DO actually did. During this time, DOs constituted only 3-4 percent of the total U.S. physician population. In addi - tion to small numbers, other barriers to widespread recog - nition included disproportionate geographic distribution of DOs, disparity in legal and practice rights, and osteo - pathic physicians' strong focus on primary care, which distanced them from the research scene that garnered so much media attention. Strong opposition from the allo - pathic community to extending DOs equal privileges, such as entrance into the medical military corps or holding of state and local health offices, was also a common theme during this time. Ironically, one consequence of DOs being legislature and its refusal to grant licensure to DOs, Dr. Still expanded his curriculum to four terms, totaling 20 months of study, in subjects that included anatomy, physiology, surgery and obstetrics. The curriculum was later further expanded to include classes such as histology, pathology and chemistry. In light of these changes, DOs were granted the right to practice in the state of Missouri in 1897. Rapid growth followed this legislation, and the student population of the ASO rose from 21 in its inaugural class to around 700 stu - dents by the turn of the century. During this time, Dr. Still also welcomed several new faculty, all of whom had per - sonal experience with osteopathic medicine and many of whom held PhD and MD degrees. As Dr. Still's school grew, so did the osteopathic pro - fession. In 1897, the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) was founded to set educational standards across all osteopathic colleges and maintain a committee on osteo - pathic education. The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association (JAOA) was first published in 1901. All the while, osteopathic medicine remained as pure in its phi - losophy as it was when it was first conceived. Higher Standards THE EARLY 1900 s were a time of constant flux for the osteopathic profession. Several more osteopathic med - ical schools were founded, but most closed for finan - cial reasons, or merged with other schools. The ques - tion of whether or not to include pharmaceutical agents in osteopathic medical teaching and practice was heavily debated within the profession at this time, especially con - sidering the contributions of scientists like Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch to the advancement of immunological and germ theory. Dr. Still was decidedly set against phar - maceuticals, mainly because of his deep-seated mistrust of drugs being used during that time and his desire to keep osteopathic medicine as pure as possible. But, slowly, phamaceutical agents were integrated into the curriculum of many osteopathic medical schools. In 1917, Dr. Still died at the age of 89. A statue in his honor was erected in the Kirksville courthouse square; it still stands there today. Many challenges awaited the osteopathic profession in the wake of Dr. Still's death. The Flexner Report in 1910 forced many sub-standard medical schools, osteopathic, allopathic, eclectic and homeopathic alike, to change their curricula or even close in the decades that followed. Some general weaknesses Flexner's evaluation exposed among the existing eight osteopathic medical schools included: lower prerequisite coursework entrance standards than allopathic medical schools required, sparse basic sci - ence laboratory and clinical training facilities, and inade - quate faculty. The reasons behind the apparent inferiority of osteopathic education were complex (limited funding, A Brief Guide to Osteopathic Medicine - For Students, By Students 13 Back to Table of Contents Chapter 2: The Philosophy and History of Osteopathic Medicine verted into accredited MD-granting institutions.8 Finally, in 1961, the CMA and the California Osteo - pathic Association (COA) came to an agreement that an academic MD degree would be offered to licensed Cali - fornia DOs. However, a number of provisions, including the loss of the ability for these \"ex-DOs\" to self-identify as osteopathic physicians, were included in this agreement. The end result amounted to the osteopathic profession losing one of its colleges, the California Osteopathic Med - ical Association, approximately 60 percent of its residency training programs and a significant number of DOs, with more than 2,000 California DOs becoming MDs. Further - more, this action precluded the future licensure of DOs in California, causing the actual number of DOs practicing in California to plummet. That same year, the AMA issued a report that made its professional stance very clear: \"There cannot be two distinct sciences of medicine or two dif - ferent yet equally valid systems of medical practice. \" The merger was not the end-all for California. In the years fol - lowing the merger, ex-DO MDs faced several serious chal - lenges, including professional segregation and discrimi - natory policies that barred their certification by allopathic boards in California and other states. Past, Present and Future THROUGHOUT THE YEARS following the California merger, the osteopathic profession made great strides despite continued opposition and pressure for national amalgamation from the AMA. During the 1960s and 1970s, increasing federal and state support of profes - sional schools, include osteopathic medical colleges, brought tens of millions of dollars to osteopathic educa - tion. In turn, faculty, equipment and facilities were vastly improved. In 1966, the U.S. military began to recognize DOs as equal to MDs, thereby allowing osteopathic physi - cians to serve as military physicians. Student qualifications also continued to improve in the five established osteo - pathic colleges, and by 1978, 95 percent of their matricu - lants held at least a Bachelor's degree. Many more osteopathic medical colleges, including the profession's first public schools, were established as well. In 1969, the first state-supported osteopathic medical school was established at Michigan State University (MSUCOM). In 1971, the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine (TCOM), which had enrolled its first students a year before, began to receive state funding. By 1975, TCOM became a public insti - tution affiliated with North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas). Additional osteopathic schools followed suit, and by 1980, the total number of osteopathic schools had risen to 14. By 1982, there were more than 20,000 DOs in practice (see Figure 2-1 ). By 1973, DOs were fully licensed to practice in all 50 states, with Mississippi being the last state to pass such leg -prohibited from serving in the armed forces was that mili - tary MDs, upon returning to their respective communities following their service, often discovered that they had lost much of their medical practice to DOs. This engendered further resentment of DOs by some members of the allo - pathic community. The Trouble with California MANY DO s BECAME frustrated with the inequities that persisted between the osteopathic and allopathic profes - sions, including those of funding, faculty, postgraduate training, and public perception. This frustration was espe - cially prevalent among DOs in California. Until the passage of the Hill-Burton Act, DOs in California were segregated from MDs in their medical practice. They were prohibited from training or seeing patients in facilities run by MDs. Furthermore, even after the act was passed in 1946, profes - sional segregation persisted, as the legislation only lifted restrictions of DO practice rights in hospitals that had been built with federal funds.8 To make matters worse, California's allopathic med - ical establishment was decidedly anti-DO, and great efforts were made to try to eliminate the profession alto - gether. Talks were underway between DOs and MDs alike to merge the two professions by granting MD degrees to licensed California DOs. However, this proposal met sig - nificant opposition, with many MDs still believing DOs to be cultists and inferior practitioners, and many DOs fearing that this action would lead to a total amalgamation of the two professions, thereby stripping osteopathic medi - cine of its distinctive qualities. In light of these issues, the 1940s and 1950s saw an unprecedented level of interaction between the two pro - fessions. An AMA committee visited osteopathic medical schools to better understand their curriculum and deter - mine the quality of osteopathic medical education. The resulting reports concluded that osteopathic medicine was not, in fact, a cultist art, and that further efforts should be made by the allopathic community to generate greater interprofessional support for osteopathic medicine. How - ever, in 1955, despite the committee's efforts, the AMA ruled in a house vote that osteopathic medicine would still be considered a cult and that there would be no formal profes - sional relations without the DOs' total abandonment of any self-proclaimed uniqueness within their curriculum. There was still the question of what was to happen in California. Most California DOs, as well the allopathic California Medical Association (CMA), were in favor of a merger, while the AOA remained opposed to it. Yet, the CMA specifically stipulated that it would only accept pro - fessional interaction with DOs who practiced according to scientific principles - not including osteopathy - and osteopathic schools that were in the process of being con -14 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Back to Table of Contents Chapter 2: The Philosophy and History of Osteopathic Medicine In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi - cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop - athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo - pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine . The phrase \"osteopathic medicine\" is now the accepted term for the profession over \"osteopathy, \" a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med - icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other \"allopathic\" teachings. The cen - tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni - tion of DOs.islation. The following year, the California State Supreme Court overturned the merger legislation from over a decade prior, thus allowing the reinstatement of an osteo - pathic licensing board, a medical society, and a new school, now known as Western University of Health Sci - ences College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific. How - ever, the emergence of government-sponsored insurance and managed care programs brought about new chal - lenges for the osteopathic profession. DOs were histori - cally severely underrepresented in the decisions regarding Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for osteopathic medical services. In fact, it was not until 1995 that the first DO was named to serve on the Physician Payment Review Commission, which advised Congress on policy con - cerning such reimbursements. Today, numerous issues, including physician reim - bursement, still surround osteopathic medicine. The most pertinent of these concerns are internship and resi - dency shortages, public awareness and perception, clinical research on OMM, DO-MD relations, and the effort to dis - tinguish DOs from MDs in light of the progressive blurring of distinctions between the two professions. All of these issues are quite complex and are further elaborated on later in this guidebook. Figure 2-1.

Osteopathic physicians use OMM as a key treatment option in their care for patients. It involves the use of the hands as the pri - mary diagnostic, treatment, and therapeutic tool. DOs uti - lize screening and scanning for visual and palpatory TART (see sidebar) changes to identify areas of somatic dysfunc - tion in the bones, muscles, joints, ligaments, and tendons, which can then be treated with a wide array of manual techniques. The goal of OMM is to address the somatic dysfunction either by directly treating the lesion, or by manipulating the body in such a way that allows the mus - culoskeletal system to correct itself - this would be called an \"indirect\" technique.1 Oftentimes, OMM is used as an adjunct to traditional medical care and has been shown to reduce such clinical variables as pain, need for and extent of pharmaceutical drug use, and recovery time.3, 4 There are more than 500 different OMM techniques. Some are similar to those used by chiropractors, phys - ical therapists, and/or massage therapists, while other methods are completely unique to osteopathic medicine.3 Below is a list of the major OMM techniques (both direct and indirect) that DOs are trained to use: 1, 2 Direct Treatment Modalities Soft Tissue Techniques - direct lateral or linear stretching of muscle and fascia (connective tissue that surrounds the muscles, organs and other structures), frequently used to prepare for or conclude overall treatment. Articulatory Treatment System - low velocity, moderate- to high-amplitude springing focused on joint functioning. High Velocity Low Amplitude (HVLA) - use of fast, short thrusts through restrictive articulatory bar - riers; a technique with which most people are familiar (also known as the \"cracking\" or \"popping\" technique).Definitions diagnoses; is defined as \"the impaired or altered function of related compo - nents of the somatic (body framework) system: skeletal, arthrodial, and myofascial structures, vascular, lymphatic, and neural ele - ments. \"1 DOs use the acronym TART (Tissue texture change, Asymmetry, Restriction, and Tenderness) as diagnostic criteria to eval - uate a specific region of the body for somatic dysfunction.2 Key Lesion: Defined as \"the somatic dysfunc - tion that maintains a total dysfunction pattern including other secondary dysfunctions. \"2 Facilitation: Refers to altered or enhanced neuronal activity (sensitivity), often due to repetitive stress. The neurons in a facilitated area are in a partial, sub-threshold excited state, meaning it takes less of a stimulus to cause sensation or pain.2 This can often present as tenderness upon palpation and/or restriction of motion. Tissue Texture Abnormality (TTA): A palpable change in tissues from skin to periarticular struc - tures that represents any paresthesias. Types of TTAs increased/decreased moisture.2 Restriction: A resistance or impediment to movement.2 Ease : Relative palpable freedom of motion of an articulation or tissue.2 A Brief Guide to Osteopathic Medicine - For Students, By Students 17 Back to Table of Contents Chapter 3: Breaking Down Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine generally not as aggressive as others and can thus be applied to a wider population. Osteopathic Cranial Manipulative Medicine - a system of treatment that utilizes the intrinsic motion of the cranial and neurological system to treat the whole body; one of the most difficult techniques for physi - cians to master, and for this reason, one of the more controversial within the medical field. Ligamentous Articulatory Release - ligaments or joints are placed into a state of balanced tension until a release is felt. Still Technique - patient held at position of ease until release, then passively moved through the barrier quickly. Treatment Modalities that are Neither Direct nor Indirect Chapman's Reflexes - Chapman's points are points on the body that, if tender, indicate visceral dysfunction. These can be treated in a variety of ways, including muscle energy and myofascial release. Lymphatic Techniques - rhythmic, usually passive, move - ment of patient to increase flow of lymphatic fluid. Muscle Energy - uses post-isometric relaxation to stretch muscles and increase range of motion. With the targeted muscle stretched to its barrier, the patient is instructed to move toward ease (away from restric - tion) while the physician resists by using an isometric counterforce. Inhibition - slow, direct application of steady pressure to relax muscles or reduce muscle contraction. Indirect Treatment Modalities Strain/Counterstrain - focused on specific tender points on the body that are held in a position of ease for 90 seconds, after which the tenderness is relieved. Facilitated Positional Release - patient's spine is placed at neutral position while the isolated segment for treat - ment is placed at ease. Compression or traction is then added to release muscle, fascia, and/or joints. Both Direct and/or Indirect Treatment Modalities Myofascial Release - encompasses many of the modalities mentioned above and is used to treat restrictions of muscle and fascia. This technique is Photo courtesy of DMU-COM18 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Back to Table of Contents Chapter 3: Breaking Down Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine leads the lab by demonstrating and explaining the tech - nique to the class, while table-trainers, usually faculty members whose specialty is OMM and/or student OMM fellows, provide one-on-one guidance to students. Osteo - pathic students are first introduced to the world of OMM through differentiation of the \"feel\" of the different levels of tissue in the body (skin, fascia, muscle, bone, etc.). After gaining this palpatory literacy, they move on to more com - plex topics, such as osteopathic diagnoses, charting, phys - ical exams, techniques and treatments. OMM can be chal - lenging, though, as many students find that it takes a great deal of practice to master the techniques that they have learned. In fact, some even elect to pursue a year-long, pre-doctoral OMM fellowship, in which they receive addi - tional training by rotating with OMM specialists, serving as table-trainers, and presenting lectures on OMM. This results in completion of their medical school training in five rather than four years. What evidence is there that OMM actually works? There are many people who claim that OMM lacks the vaunted randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, which have been hailed as the gold standard for evi - dence-based research, to support or merit its use in clin - ical practice. However, there have been numerous studies that do support the efficacy of OMM. The problem is that these studies do not fit the gold standard criteria, and the reasons why OMM studies don't fit the criteria will be dis - cussed below. For instance, several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that OMM is useful in the treatment of low back pain.3, 5 One such RCT divided 178 patients into an OMM group and a standard-care group. Although this study found no difference between the two groups in terms of clinical outcomes, including pain, the OMM group required significantly fewer medica - tions, most notably non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, which can sometimes have major adverse side effects,) analgesics, and muscle relaxants. In addition, the OMM group required less physical therapy as compared to the standard-care group, and the average costs for care were significantly lower.6 In another study led by Licciardone on the efficacy of OMM for back pain during the third trimester of preg - nancy, researchers compared back pain in three groups: usual obstetrical care (UOBC) and OMM (UOBC + OMM), UOBC and sham (placebo) ultrasound treatment (UOBC + SUT), and UOBC only. They found that back pain decreased in the UOBC + OMM group, remained con - sistent in the UOBC + SUT group, and increased in the How is OMM taught in osteopathic medical schools? Approximately 200-300 hours of the first two years of osteopathic medical school are devoted to the manual manipulation portion of the osteopathic curriculum. Osteopathic medical students learn OMM in the same sci - entific manner that they learn pharmacology and other treatment regimens. For each osteopathic treatment modality, there are physiologic mechanisms of action, indications and contraindications, and situations when one technique may be more efficacious than another. While osteopathic principles, philosophy and history are taught in traditional lecture format, the unique, hands- on nature of OMM requires training in clinical laborato - ries. During a typical OMM lab session, students partner up and take turns acting as the practitioner and as the patient. Over the course of the session, a faculty member Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)Photo courtesy of OSU-COM A Brief Guide to Osteopathic Medicine - For Students, By Students 19 Back to Table of Contents Chapter 3: Breaking Down Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine a sufficient number of capable and willing osteopathic physicians to perform the research tasks is necessary to account for inter-operator variability. One possible expla - nation for osteopathic research seeming to have secondary importance in the profession is that few osteopathic schools are affiliated with teaching hospitals, in which large-scale projects could be conducted more freely and given a more visible position. Much like studies in surgery, psychiatry, and other procedures or personal therapies, implementing control groups and placebos is more diffi - cult in osteopathic studies as well, hindering these studies from garnering the same acceptance in the scientific com - munity as drug studies that can be double-blinded; cur - rently, no treatment, sham (range of motion testing or pal - pation with no actual treatment), or light-touch treatment groups are used.9 More single-blind studies, which would increase validity, should be performed with external OMM practitioners who provide treatment but do not have a vested interest in the study outcome. Considering the challenges associated with con - ducting clinical trials on OMM, it is not surprising that many researchers have now turned to in vitro models in order to demonstrate OMM's efficacy on the cellular level. In one study, human fibroblasts were subjected to repeti - tive motion strain (RMS) using a vacuum to simulate the cellular effects of somatic dysfunction. Some cells were then placed in a strain-free setting to simulate an indirect osteopathic manipulative technique (IOMT). RMS+IOMT cells displayed decreased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as increased proliferation as compared UOBC-only group, but did not find statistical significance in the inter-group differences. This was a randomized study that stratified participants by age and number of pre - vious pregnancies to reduce possible data confounding. However, the researchers admitted that the limited number of participants restricted randomization in terms of illicit drug use, ethnicity, and vaginal bleeding, and sug - gested a larger trial as the necessary next step.7 The Multicenter Osteopathic Pneumonia Study in the Elderly (MOPSE), which included more than 400 patients over the age of 50 hospitalized for pneumonia across seven community hospitals, demonstrated that the combination of OMT + conventional care significantly reduced length of stay, occurrence of respiratory failure or death, and use of IV antibiotics compared to the conventional care-only and light-touch (placebo) + conventional care groups.8 Throughout our review of the existing osteopathic lit - erature, we discovered that finding strong, valid evidence to support OMM proved somewhat difficult due to the general shortage of research and the limitations of cur - rent studies. Common obstacles in osteopathic research include small sample sizes, the subjectivity of unclearly defined pain scales, lack of double-blinding, pre-trial par - ticipant bias regarding OMM, occasional lack of inter- judge reliability, an d failure to account for inter-operator variability.3 Many factors contribute to the prevalence of such lim - itations in osteopathic research. The relatively low number of osteopathic physicians compared to allopathic physi - cians seems to be one important contributor. For example, Photo courtesy of CCOM/MWU20 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Back to Table of Contents Chapter 3: Breaking Down Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine Will public perception of OMM improve in the future? In recent years, there has been a large movement within the osteopathic profession to support the expan - sion of OMM's scientific evidence base. In 2001, the Osteo - pathic Research Center ( http://www.hsc.unt.edu/orc /) was established to focus on and enhance collaborative research describing OMM's clinical efficacy and mech - anisms of action.13 Several other independent programs with similar goals have also been launched at individual colleges of osteopathic medicine, including Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio Uni - versity Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, and the Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine. In the article \"Somatic, semantic distinctions: DOs try to come to terms with manual therapists, \" published in the AOA's The DO , the author discusses the controversy of DOs teaching non-DOs, such as physical therapists and other health care providers, osteopathic manipulative treat - ments. Some argue that because these non-DOs, some of whom are not licensed physicians, have not received comprehensive osteopathic medical training, they are not fit to practice OMT.14 However, the reason this article was brought to your attention was to show that there is an increasing interest in OMT among manual therapists and MDs alike. In addition, there are now conferences, courses and rotations available to MDs that are specifically geared toward OMT training.15 This trend will most likely continue as more and more physicians (and patients!) pursue alter - natives to surgery and pain medications.with those subjected to RMS alone. These beneficial effects persisted 24 hours after the IOMT was performed and con - tinued even after the RMS was restored. Though in vitro studies such as this have their own limitations, they are useful in elucidating the biological mechanisms behind OMM's clinical effects.10 In this section we have presented a few studies dem - onstrating OMM's efficacy. While there are a number of studies in the literature that we felt had too many limita - tions to warrant much validity, we have listed a few notable examples of recent studies performed in osteopathic med - ical research at the end of this chapter. Thus, we encourage you to read the full articles of the research we have pre - sented, the articles listed at the end of the chapter, and to conduct further research of your own. Why do so few practitioners practice OMM on a daily basis? A 2003 study by Spaeth and Pheley, which surveyed Ohio osteopathic physicians on their use of OMM for one week, revealed that 44 percent did not use OMM at all, 31 percent used OMM to treat fewer than 10 patients, and 25 percent used OMM to treat more than 10 patients. Of this 25 percent, 6 percent claimed to have treated more than 30 patients with OMM. The survey's 871 responses (38 per - cent response rate) fairly accurately represented the spe - cialty distribution of Ohio osteopathic physicians.11 There are various reasons why DOs trained in OMM do not include the techniques they learned in school in their practice. For some, it is difficult to integrate OMM into their specific specialty (e.g., surgery, radiology, der - matology). Also, some DOs may have gone to an osteopathic medical school simply to become a doctor, and do not necessarily believe in OMM or its prin - ciples. Others may not feel comfort - able enough with OMM to perform it on patients; some techniques, such as HVLA, require greater proficiency to be used effectively and safely on patients. In the Spaeth and Pheley study, many of the practicing osteopathic physi - cians who reported limited use of OMM also rated their OMM training as \"less than satisfactory, especially in the clin - ical years. \"11 This reinforces the idea that more extensive, consistent training in OMM would be beneficial for patients, osteopathic physicians, and the profes - sion as a whole. Other barriers that have been reported by DOs include limited time for patient visits, lack of or poor reimbursement for OMM treatments, and inadequate equipment or facilities available in their practice settings.12 Photo courtesy of CCOM/MWY A Brief Guide to Osteopathic Medicine - For Students, By Students 21 Back to Table of Contents Chapter 3: Breaking Down Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what \"osteopathic manipulative medicine\" entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo - pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

While there is some overlap between the two types of practitioners, they represent dis - tinct professions and separate schools of thought. Chi - ropractic was first enunciated in 1895 by Daniel David Palmer, who observed that displacement of vertebrae could affect neurotransmission, thus manifesting as dis - ease. Palmer was a magnetic healer, but unlike A.T. Still, he did not have a medical background. While the chiro - practic philosophy is historically focused on the nervous system, the original notion of osteopathic medicine was the need to restore blood flow, in particular, via manipula - tion of the neuromusculoskeletal system.6 The differences in education and training between the two professions are apparent.

Although some osteopathic medical schools are highly ranked by the system, with one ranking in the Top 20 Primary Care Med - ical Schools category, most are either poorly ranked or not ranked at all.6 Why do osteopathic medical schools fare so poorly in these rankings? First of all, research is generally more emphasized at allopathic medical schools, and thus DO schools rank lower than their MD counterparts in this category overall as well as associated subcategories, such as NIH grant funding - specifics of which are discussed in the next sec - tion of this chapter. Furthermore, the criteria used to judge the schools have inherent biases against osteopathic med - ical schools. The four main criteria, in order of weight in a school's overall score, include: quality assessment, pro - portion of graduates pursuing primary care, ratio of full- time faculty members to students, and selectivity of admis - sions.6 The first, quality assessment, is determined via opinion surveys sent out to medical school deans and department heads, as well as allopathic residency direc - tors, requesting ratings of each of the 133 allopathic and 26 osteopathic medical schools. These evaluators consis - tently rate osteopathic medical schools lower on average than allopathic medical schools, perhaps due to a lack of awareness and/or understanding of osteopathic medical education, especially in regions with a limited osteopathic presence. As for the primary care proportion, many more MDs than DOs enter internal medicine residencies only to later subspecialize, but these graduates are neverthe - less counted as pursuing primary care. In addition, osteo - pathic medical schools use a higher proportion of part- time faculty members than do allopathic schools, thus not achieving comparable full-time-faculty-to-student ratios.7 During a recent U.S. News & World Report summit meeting entitled \"The Impact and Future of Medical School Rankings, \" a panel of prominent medical school deans representing such high-ranking programs as Duke, Harvard and Yale met to discuss the influence of and pos - sible improvements to the current ranking system.8,9,10 The discussion was moderated by the editor of U.S. News & World Report and also included the company's director of data research, who has led the rankings project for many years. Concerns voiced regarding survey methodology were varied and included: the subjective and static nature of responses regarding program reputation, low response rates among residency directors, and limited knowledge of respondents about programs other than their own.8,9,10 This chapter is divided into several sections based on some of the primary reservations we have observed in pre-medical students with respect to applying to osteopathic medical schools. Each section addresses one of the most common concerns. U.S. News & World Report Rankings OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIANS ARE well-recognized as having the propensity to enter primary care. In fact, the 2014 U.S. News & World Report reported that the top four U.S. medical schools producing the most primary care res - idents were osteopathic medical schools. Furthermore, an additional eight osteopathic schools were listed in the top 20 schools producing primary care residents.4, 5 However, there has been much debate as to whether or not the U.S. News & World Report's criteria for major Fast Facts: Approximately 57 percent of osteopathic phy - sicians are in primary care (family and general practice, pediatrics, general internal medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology).1 In a 2013 survey of entering osteopathic med - ical students, 21 percent oindicated that they had decided to practice medicine in an under - served community on graduation. 2 In the 2014 American Osteopathic Match, 50 percent of DO graduates matched in Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, or Pediatrics. For the 2014 NRMP match 53 percent of DO gradu - ates matched to those three primary care spe - cialties. (The overall graduate medical educa - tion (GME) placement rate for all DOs seeking GME was 99.45%).24 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Back to Table of Contents Chapter 4: Why Apply to Osteopathic Medical School? Research and Other Opportunities AS WE'VE NOTED before, primary care-focused education, not research, bears the heaviest emphasis within the mis - sion statements of osteopathic medical schools. In addition to this deliberate focus on education, a key issue contrib - uting to this lack of emphasis on research is the disparity in research funding between allopathic and osteopathic insti - tutions. Despite steady yearly increases in research funding from various sources, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), pharmaceutical companies, state and local sources, and private foundations, osteopathic medical schools still significantly trail their allopathic counterparts in funding from all of these source categories.14 For instance, in 2010, 133 institutions affiliated with allopathic medical schools in all U.S. states and territories received funding from the NIH, the primary U.S. agency responsible for biomedical and health-related research. The total amount of NIH funding for these institutions was upwards of $11.5 billion, representing over half of the total NIH U.S. funding granted that year. This funding was predominantly geared toward research, but also was uti - lized for training, fellowships, and construction. Out of the 133 institutions receiving NIH funding, the median dollar amount received was at the University of Arizona, which was granted about $45.2 million.15 In contrast, only 13 academic institutions affiliated with osteopathic medical schools received funding from the NIH in 2010, with a grand total of $75.2 million com - bined. The median amount received by an osteopathic institution was the just over $1.5 million granted to Touro University College of Osteopathic Medicine - California.15 (It should be noted, however, that these figures represent the amount of funding granted to the academic institu - tions as a whole, not necessarily the individual colleges of medicine or osteopathic medicine. Osteopathic med - ical schools sometimes exist within a University setting in which there are other \"colleges\" or \"schools\" under the \"university\" umbrella.) There are many factors that contribute to this wide disparity in funding. First, the majority of osteopathic medical schools are private, graduate-level institutions not affiliated with large, undergraduate institutions. In fact, only six of the 30 osteopathic medical schools are public, and only four are affiliated with undergraduate insti - tutions. Another possible factor could be reputation or simply precedence, as many osteopathic medical schools were not founded until the 1970s and beyond. In fact, only five of the current schools were established before 1969 (A.T. Still University - Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine, Des Moines University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine of Midwestern The summit participants also raised flaws in utilizing fac - ulty-to-student ratios and MCAT scores as quality indi - cators.8,10 Many suggested that more tangible measures of program quality be used, including board scores, resi - dency match results, numbers of hours of clinical expe - rience, available research opportunities and/or overseas rotations, and frequency of student-authored publica - tions.8,9,10 Dr. Jules L. Dienstag, Dean for Medical Education at Harvard Medical School, went so far as to propose that prospective medical students would be better off going to their schools' pre-medical advisors for information rather than relying on the rankings.11 A full transcript and video of the event are available at www.usnews.com . Another suggestion for improving the U.S. News & World Report methodology is that because medical schools' educational missions significantly differ from one another, these differences should be reflected in the ranking system. Alternative methods of ranking the schools have been proposed, many including factors related to how well a school fulfills its own unique, indi - vidual mission.12 Other systems incorporate more under- appreciated variables, such as proportions of primary care graduates, graduates serving in underserved health- professional-shortage areas, and/or graduates with minority backgrounds underrepresented in medicine.13 A George Washington University study combined these vari - ables and others into a \"social mission score\" with which to rank medical schools. Its ranking system placed many prestigious programs that consistently top the U.S. News & World Report rankings much lower, or even at the bottom in some cases. Osteopathic medical school programs' ranks varied, as their primary care physician outputs were consistently high but their proportions of underrepre - sented minority graduates were found to be lacking.13 Photo courtesy of LECOM A Brief Guide to Osteopathic Medicine - For Students, By Students 25 Back to Table of Contents Trends in Osteopathic Medical School Applicants, Enrollment, and Graduates - Figures The summary tables below display the growth in applicants, enrollment, and graduates since 1977.

Despite this growth, the distribution of osteopathic physicians in the United States remains geographically dispropor - tionate, heavily favoring such areas as the Midwest and the Northeast.University, and Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences College of Osteopathic Medicine).16 Still, diverse opportunities exist for osteopathic med - ical students to enrich their educational experience. Eight osteopathic colleges currently offer medical scien - tist training programs (DO/PhD), and 24 offer other joint degree programs combined with the DO degree, including Master's degrees in epidemiology, public health, biomed - ical sciences, health care administration, and business administration, as well as the Juris Doctorate (JD) degree. Eleven schools even offer joint-degree BS/DO or BA/DO programs.17 Growth of the Profession DESPITE THE LIMITED funding sources of its colleges, the osteopathic profession is steadily growing. DOs are one of the fastest-growing groups of practitioners in the health care industry today.1 Enrollment in the osteopathic med - ical colleges has risen by 58 percent since 2003.18 In the spring of 2011, there were 4,200 graduates from all osteo - pathic medical colleges, a 15.7 percent increase over the 3,631 DOs who graduated in spring 2010.18 This recent surge can be attributed to the establishment of a large number of osteopathic medical schools in the last decade (see Figure 4-1 ).

Nonetheless, sources did share commonalities in the advice given about residency programs. They agreed that each student should carefully consider all of the following factors to determine the perfect fit for his/her individual goals: program stability, program support, prestige, patient population, level of academic orientation, and everything that program location entails (e.g., cost of living, sources of entertainment, suitable environment for raising a family).21 Ultimately, considering all of these aspects will influence selection of certain residency programs over others. Recently, a member of the Student Doctor Network (SDN) forum ( http://forums.studentdoctor.net /), a pop - ular online forum for members of the pre-health and professional health care community to discuss various topics related to their respective fields, gathered 2011 res - idency match data from the AOA and the National Resi - dent Matching Program (NRMP), the allopathic matching service. Because the two programs are distinct and do not present each other's match statistics, his goal was to com - bine data for osteopathic students who participated in the AOA match with those who participated in the NRMP match. The combined data demonstrated that of the 3,875 osteopathic graduates in 2011, 3,456 (89.19 percent) matched into an AOA or NRMP residency program. 1,895 DO graduates out of the 2,112 who applied for the AOA match (89.64 percent) matched. 71.70 percent of DO grad - uates who applied for the NRMP match matched into an Residency Opportunities THE INCREASE IN the number of osteopathic medical schools has been so steep, in fact, that the number of new osteopathic school graduates has already surpassed the number of available AOA residencies. For the 2011 AOA match, there were 3,875 new osteopathic graduates and only 2,549 AOA residency positions. However, because osteopathic graduates can also apply to allopathic residen - cies accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), the match ended with only 419 unmatched osteopathic graduates. In recent years, it has become more popular for osteopathic students to apply to ACGME residencies.19 Reasons for an individu - al's choice of an allopathic residency program as opposed to an osteopathic program include factors such as loca - tion and program availability (which changes from year to year, especially in the case of some smaller specialties). Occasionally, the perception that ACGME residencies are superior to those of the AOA in terms of quality and future employment eligibility may also influence this decision.20 In our research, it was difficult to locate a centralized database or source for reviews, some metrics of quality, and prestige of residency programs. Most sources were, unfortunately, scattered and from individuals with varied general opinions of either residency match program. Map as of 5/4/2015Figure 4-2. Current distribution of osteopathic medical schools in the United States28 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Back to Table of Contents Chapter 4: Why Apply to Osteopathic Medical School? Licensing Examinations SINCE 2001, ALL state licensing boards have accepted the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Exam - ination of the United States (COMLEX-USA), which is produced by the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME). The United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), produced by the National Board of Med - ical Examiners (NMBE), is the licensing exam that all allo - pathic medical students are required to take. Both are comprised of three tests, called \"steps\" by the USMLE and \"levels\" by the COMLEX, which must be passed for a phy - sician to gain unlimited licensure to practice medicine in the United States. According to 2013 USMLE Performance Data pub - lished in the 2013 NBME Annual Report , 97 percent of MD students (N=19,108), 94 percent of DO students (N=2,680), and 79 percent of foreign medical students and gradu - ates (N=14,649) passed the USMLE Step 1 exam on their first attempt. The pass rates for the USMLE Step 2 exam (from 2012-2013) showed narrowing between the groups: 98 percent (N=18,658), 96 percent (N=1,615), and 84 per - cent (N=12,203), respectively.22 The reason only a minority of DO students elect to take the USMLE is because it is optional and not required for their licensure. Osteopathic medical students may elect to take the USMLE based on a variety of reasons, including the desire to pursue an allopathic residency program. Osteopathic medical students are unique in that they have the option to apply for osteopathic (AOA) residency programs, allo - pathic (ACGME) residency programs, dual-accredited pro - grams, or both AOA and ACGME programs. However, all osteopathic students are required to take the COMLEX, regardless of whether or not they elect to take the USMLE. Thus, those who do take the USMLE must take both exams, which slightly differ in their length, emphasis, and ques - tion type, although they cover similar material apart from OMM.ACGME residency, compared to the 94.40 percent U.S. MD NRMP match rate in the same year. Percentages of allopathic and osteopathic students who matched in specific specialties ( see Table 4-3 ) showed that there were some important distinctions in proportions of graduates (DO vs. U.S. MD) going into certain fields, namely Family Medicine, Pediatrics, and Emergency Med - icine. Despite the common misconception that highly competitive specialties are not open to DO graduates, sig - nificant numbers of DOs enter such fields as orthopedic surgery, anesthesiology, and diagnostic radiology. Several limitations of this data analysis were acknowl - edged by the contributing SDN member, Jimmy DeMeo, who is currently an osteopathic medical student at Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) and the national Student Osteopathic Medical Association (SOMA) president. For instance, the analysis did not take into con - sideration how applicants ranked specialties, whether or not they matched into their top choice of specialty, mul - tiple match attempts, post-match placement, or scramble results. It also did not include results from the San Fran - cisco matching program, which is a third system apart from the AOA and NRMP that matches applicants to a few highly competitive specialties, including neurology, oph - thalmology, and plastic surgery. Specialty DO Graduates U.S. MD Graduates Family Medicine 19.51% 7.39% Pediatrics 8.14% 10.04% combine data from the 2011 NRMP match and the 2011 AOA match.Table 4-3.

With so many osteopathic medical schools focusing on producing primary care physicians, some people inter - ested in specializing may dismiss the idea of attending an osteopathic medical school. However, even osteopathic medical schools with a mission statement of producing more primary care physicians do not restrict or disad - vantage students who are thinking about entering a sub - specialty in the future. On the contrary, we believe that a strong foundation in primary care, osteopathic principles, and OMM can aid a physician no matter what specialty he or she decides to practice. Medicine is evolving every day. New medications and treatment modalities are constantly being discovered. But perhaps just as important as scientific advancements is the constant flux of the culture of medicine. Within the med - ical field today, there are many different types of health care providers and allied health professionals who work together to treat patients, oftentimes having overlapping scopes of practice. These health care professionals include but are not limited to: MDs, DOs, physician assistants, nurses and nurse practitioners, pharmacists, podiatrists, chiropractors, dentists, optometrists, clinical psycholo - gists, and physical and occupational therapists. Consid - ering the varied educational backgrounds represented in health care today, it is important for those in the field (and those planning to enter it) to understand and appreciate this diversity. As future physicians, one of our goals will be to help our patients make informed decisions, and we would not have it any other way with you, our reader. We hope that this guide will help you make an informed decision about osteopathic medical school. While this is in no way a com - prehensive collection of all the opinions regarding osteo - pathic medicine, we tried our best to cover as many bases as possible, and to provide you with an objective, infor - mative presentation of osteopathic medicine. The fact that you are reading this shows that you are already well on your way toward making an informed decision. We applaud your efforts and urge you to continue to learn more by referring to our cited works, utilizing our rec - ommended resources, conducting some more research of your own, and of course, shadowing DOs. There is no better way to learn about an occupation than to experience it yourself.OVER 140 YEARS ago, Dr. Andrew Taylor Still founded osteopathic medicine on the basis of the interdependence he observed among all of the body's anatomical parts, as well as the unity that linked an individual's mind, body, and spirit. Through this philosophy, he sought to reform and revolutionize the practice of medicine. Today, the original philosophy and principles of osteopathic medi - cine have become inextricably linked to modern advance - ments in clinical practice. In recent years, the osteopathic medical profession has flourished. It has seen its greatest increases in the number of U.S. osteopathic medical schools, DO gradu - ates, and opportunities available to osteopathic physi - cians. Osteopathic medicine continues to gain headway in terms of interprofessional collaboration with MDs as well as general recognition of its presence within medicine.23 However, the task of clearly defining and popularizing the \"DO difference, \" that is, the unique contribution DOs offer to the practice of medicine, remains an important chal - lenge facing the new generation of osteopathic physicians. Meanwhile, the current pre-medical student culture is as competitive as it has ever been. As average admissions statistics continue to improve every year, more and more highly qualified applicants compete for a limited number of medical school seats. Consequently, pre-medical stu - dents are known to strive for the best possible grades and test scores and the most prestigious medical schools. It is only natural that some pre-medical students who do not fully understand the history or context of osteopathic med - icine would cast osteopathic medicine off as an inferior profession based solely on its lower admissions statistics, lack of emphasis on research, and/or lower percentages of practitioners in highly specialized fields. Our hope is that readers of this guidebook will come away with a more realistic and objective perspective on the advantages of and future challenges facing osteo - pathic medicine. Furthermore, we would like to reiterate that osteopathic medicine does not deserve a reputation as a \"second choice\" profession; each and every DO and osteopathic medical student made the conscious choice to pursue osteopathic medicine. With less than 10 percent of allopathic medical grad - uates entering family practice residencies each year,24 the continued training of competent primary care physicians (PCPs) by osteopathic schools is extremely important.25 Only 32 percent of U.S. physicians are in primary care, while reports by the Council on Graduate Medical Edu - cation (COGME) and ACGME recommend that this per - centage be at least 40 percent.26 Furthermore, the nation - wide average of PCPs-to-population ratio is a mere 88 PCPs per 100,000 people.26 Emphasis on preventive med - ical services in recent health care reform initiatives will undoubtedly increase the demand for PCPs, but the cur -Conclusion30 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Back to Table of Contents Chapter 4: Why Apply to Osteopathic Medical School? 14.

The AOA and AACOM have become member orga - nizations of the ACGME, allowing the ACGME to accredit all osteopathic residency programs meeting certain requirements. The future is still uncertain but it will liely include a single match, which would integrate the previouly separate NRMP and NMS (AOA) matches. U.S. residency programs will have from July 2015 until June 2020 to restructure themselves to abide by the rules and regulations set by the ACGME. What does this mean for pre-medical students, medical students, and medical school graduates? DO students will still be required to take the COMLEX-USA exam series for licensure. The impending merger would, ideally, facilitate communication between ACGME residency programs and osteo - pathic entities within the organization, consequently giving the former a better grasp of the signifi - cance of COMLEX-USA scores in their assessment of program applicants. MDs will also be albe to apply to osteopathic-focused residency programs provided they fulfill OMM competency requirements and prerequisites. All in all, many hope for this merge to reduce the number of residency positios that go unfilled each year. Opening up all programs to both MDs and DOs will also allow greater flexibility in terms of program locations for new medical school graduates. Finally, the single accreditation system has the potential to provide the country with a consistent, uniform standard to uphold the quality of medical education, and only time will tell.
