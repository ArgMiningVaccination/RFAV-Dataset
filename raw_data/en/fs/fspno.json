He had several blood works and took HBP pills(170 with pills) but there was no improvement. One of my friends introduced Dr. Yoon and I took my husband to go see her. Dr. Yoon made herbal medicine for him and I can see his facial skin tone has changed. We checked his blood pressure daily and a few days later his blood pressure became normal. Now he's not taking any pills or medicine and still in a good condition. Dr. Yoon is his life savior and I highly recommend Nature Acupuncture! - 6/26/2023 I've been coming here for about six months, first, for an ankle sprain, and then for carpal tunnel. She was very helpful with both. There is never any up selling or pressure to buy a package or anything like that, which I appreciate. Very responsive via text for scheduling appointments, and free parking! - 1/9/2023 Pinched a nerve in my neck while lifting and was in an immense amount of pain, felt like my whole left side was on fire. Was popping Advil and Tylenol like cray, and event went to the ER for an Ultram shot, none of it made any difference. The next day after a doctor's appointment i still had no relief and no more pharmaceutical options for pain management. Pain was actually getting worse. Nature acupuncture is right by me, they fit me in within 2 hours of calling. Located in a shopping plaza, plenty of parking. I got acupuncture and electro-cupping done at the recommendation of the doctor. The treatment was crazy successful, i still can't believe it. I went home and was still in pain for a couple of hours but fell asleep (which i wasn't able to do for 2 days) and woke up 4 hours later pretty much pain free. Since i woke up my pain has been at around 10% of what it was before i walked in. I've come in for some follow up sessions and will probably just keep going back. Pain has not returned. Doctor is really good about utilizing your insurance and making sure you get the most out of your benefits. Even without insurance i think the prices are super reasonable and affordable for the level of care you are getting. Highly recommend and will keep coming back. Definitely try this if you are having nerve-related pain, it truly was a lifesaver and the only thing that worked. - 4/18/2023 Yoon is very good at what she does , she's fast and efficient. She always makes sure to not hurt you in any way , I've been to several accupunturist and sometimes certain points they do can hurt , but Yoons skills make you feel at ease and most of all comfortable with good results , thanks for your services - Solomon - 5/26/2022 I question the knowledge of Dr. Yoon. Tried acupuncture 3 times, once per week. After my last, all my symptoms of headache and fatigue were exacerbated. Dr. Yoon put a ton of needles in my skull and my right temple. After the visit, my brain felt numb and I had massive brain fog and headaches, it was scary. For days after, my head and especially right temple was extremely sensitive, felt like it was bruised internally. After 6 days, I finally feel a bit better. What also made me question her knowledge was when I asked her the benefits of Acupuncture, she responded with a 1 sentence answers \"it helps your energy qi\". Next time I come back and ask her the benefits of cupping, she responds, \"Didn't I tell you this last time?\" Very unhelpful and not personable. I then proceed to ask Dr. Yoon how I get the most benefits out of acupuncture. Do I rest? Can I exercise? What should I Eat? etc? She said - \"I don't know, maybe massage? Seems like she is not the most knowledgeable in this field. That was my experience, $65 for acupuncture felt reasonable, that's why I tried her out. Hopefully you all have a better experience. - 9/1/2022 Dr. Yoon is the best! I've been going to her weekly for over a year and she has been a great help with my shoulder pain as well as prepping my body for egg freezing. I had a very successful retrieval thanks to the work she was doing with me leading up to it. The office is very clean and she always very prompt. Has awesome bedside manners and just super sweet. I'm grateful to have found her! - 5/19/2022 Dr.Yoon is amazing. She is well trained, clean, cautious and knowledgeable. I was in an accident a few years ago and went to go see her for my ankle. The day after the session was the best my ankle has felt since before my accident. I couldn't believe how good it felt! I will continue my treatment with her. I'm impressed with the results. She takes insurance. Parking is validated. - 6/28/2022 I am SO happy to have found Dr. Yoon. The short... - IT WORKED! After suffering from absolutely the worst sinus infection of my entire life - partially due to a flare-up of my autoimmune condition and inflammation combined with flying recently... I finally found her and she was able to schedule me for acupuncture right away via text. THE NEXT DAY it was gone. (more on this below) - She has a great bedside manner, she's friendly and professional. She is relatively quiet-natured but I appreciate her grounding energy. - The office is clean and located in a building that is easy to park (& validate your parking), it's small but it works. No BS. - She is no fuss and gets right to it. I have never had to wait - right in, and right out. I've been doing 30 min treatments so for me, it's PERFECT. Just as I'm getting over laying there, I'm done. ... and for those wanting more deets - That initial appointment I had spoken to her Wednesday late afternoon and she was able to get me in by Friday! After that initial appointment I felt it draining that entire night and the whole time on her table I could feel major activity getting stirred up - like full pink and purple colored pulses and swirls in the closed eyes. Nonetheless, I was still pretty amazed the next day when I realized suddenly I felt 100% normal - no pain, no pressure, no fog it was almost like it never even happened. - I just did my second appointment today on the following Monday, ahead of a big trip I'm taking where I will be flying once again multiple times. Today's visit was to help me prepare for that. The needle placement was similar but I noticed just slightly different plus a couple of new places while other places from the initial visit were skipped. Once again, no wait, right in and although she had another patient in this time (who arrived at the same time) she kept it moving and didn't allow either of us to have to sit waiting (I can't stand waiting). - This isn't my first time trying acupuncture but it's the first time I am compelled to come back for more. In the past I don't think I received bad care, I just have never felt such a significant immediate difference in my body and a natural draw to return. I've experienced the color thing pretty significantly once before when I had a reiki session that was also far better than other sessions with other practitioners I had had. So I don't know, but I kinda now attribute the color pulses and swirls to energy movement actually happening, and truthfully, seek out someone who can do that. Today, on my second visit, I didn't have as many intense color swirls but there were some blue pulses with darker swirls. This session was so relaxing though I almost fell asleep at one point so I might have missed them a little too nodding off. If you look online most of the stuff about what the colors mean is associated with chakras, with red/purple at the crown and blue at the throat... so I guess this would make sense that on the first visit the energy was being activated at the crown, second, we're working down to the throat? IDK, but I'm into it! Can't wait to get back to book with Dr. Yoon again and am delighted I have finally found someone I look forward to seeing again! - 8/17/2022 Reina is the best acupuncturist you can find in this area. She's professional, gentle, and knowledgeable and always makes sure you feel welcome and comfortable. The process is relaxing even with the needles and cuppings. The treatment room and the office are very clean as well. My pain goes away after a few sessions of treatment. Highly recommend! - 8/1/2022 I was diagnosed with MS a right before the pandemic so although I wanted to try acupuncture for a long time, my fear of Covid kept me away. Fast forward to the end of the pandemic, and it was a top priority for me. Reina has been such a pleasure. Her business is so Covid safe, I can't believe I let it deter me for so long. Reina asked me about my condition and genuinely seemed like she wanted to help. And she has. I'm more mobile than I have been for a couple of years. Thank you Reina!
