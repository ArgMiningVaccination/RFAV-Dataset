The motion carries. b. Status Update by DHCFP Holly Long - We are very fortunate to announce the appointment of Suzanne B ierman as the new Administrator for the Division of Healthcare Financi ng and Policy. She started with us on January 14 and her main office is located in Las Vegas. A little background on Suzanne. She was prev iously at The Guinn Center i n Las Vegas. She has also served as the Assistant Director for the Medicaid Services for the Arkansas Department of Human Services. She earned her Doctorate and Mas ters in Public Health degrees from the University of Arkansas while working as a Legislative Analyst and Law Clerk for the University of Arkansas Medical Sc iences. We are very excited for Susanne to be joining our team. At the January 24, 2019, DUR Board Meeting, it was asked by the boa rd members that we send out wha t would be the second letter to the top 10 providers of opioids for fee-for-se rvice Medicaid. These letters were sent out on March 15, 2019. We haven't received any feedback related to these so far. The MMIS moderniz ation project was implemented on February 1, 2019. To provide an update on the antib iotic policy that was approved at the July 26 DUR board meeting, it was implemente d on March 4, 2019. I would li ke to announce the resignation of Dr. Adam Zold from the P&T committee. He has be en an amazing contributor to this committee. His dedication is greatly appre ciated, and his participation will be missed. We are still in the process of r ecruiting members for the Drug Use Review Board. We are looking for two physicians and tw o pharmacists that are actively practicing and licensed in the state of Nevada. I f you would like to nominate a provider that you think would be a good fit for this position, please feel free to provide your contact information to me. 4. Proposed New Drug Classes a. Anti-migraine Agents - Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) Receptor Antagonists Don Moran - Pharmacist and member of the Medical Affairs Team at Teva Pharmaceutical. We manufacture one of the CGRP inhibitors that you'll be discussing today, and that product is frema nezumab marketed under the bran d name Ajovy. I realize that you've got a lengthy packet of data to review toda y looki ng at the entire class as well as some delibera tions to perform. What I'd like to ask you do to, first of all look at this class very critically and add the class in som e fashion as an alternative to currently preventative medi cations and add at least one if n ot all the agents to your 45May 1, 2019 Page 4 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do formulary preferred status. I a m very partial to the product A jovy, of course, and would certainly ask the committee to consider it very favorably as a preferred item. The reason that I suggest that, I guess that there were some bullet points I'd like you to think about in your deliberations today. Carl Jeffery - Let me just address the audience . What we're displaying is Optum's recommendation and on the left s ide is preferred products we're recommending and that's Aimovig and Ajovy. The non- preferred we're recommending is Emgality. If you feel like you want to give an overview of the Ajovy... Don Moran - If there are questions that you might have about the product a s a result of your reading the material or you wish of some perspective to balance maybe what Optum has recommended, I'm certainly willing to take a shot at answering your questions the best I can. Carl Jeffery - This is a new class in our review the CGRPs. They are a novel product for the treatment of migraine headaches. I put a brief description of what the migraine, how they're classified. There are two basic classifications. These are used to treat the epi sodic migraines and the chronic migraines. The chronic migraines means that the person has 15 or more headache days per month. These are significant suffers of migraines and it's good that we finally have a product that's geared towa rds these more severe migraine sufferers. A lot of people don't quite meet that definition, though, so these fall into the category of the episodic migraines so that's where we get the d ifferences of the two. There's a newer neurokinin, the CGRP neuropeptide that is thought to result in the pain caused by the migraine so what these do i s inhibit the receptor, so it doesn't result in the pain. I didn't explain this well as Don could have but I'll do my best. There are three products we're going to talk about. The first one that was on the market here is the Aimovi g and this has been on the market for a few months now maybe since October. T hree different studies in the episodi c migraines. You can see the n umbers, but there are quite a few studies. All shown here, versus placebo, this one still is once a month all shown to have a reduction on migraine headache days c ompared to placebo. When we get into the migraine studies, it had again a nother 667 patients, first placebo, again for the same dosing once a month , and it also showed it was effective and reduced number of migraine days. T he next one that Don was trying to talk about and we cut him off, is the Aj ovy. A couple of studies here, the HALO for the episodic migraine and the chr onic migraine. This one's a little bit different in that it has a monthly and a quarterly dos ing, so it is kind of nice, so every 3 months they can administer this one. When they did this HALO-EM trial, they were shooting for a 1.6-day m igraine headache days reduction. They didn't quite achieve that but di d a 1.5 for it and the 1.3 quarterly. A lthough it didn't hit that significance there, it still numerically improved there. It did significantly increase the proportion of patients that achieved the reduction and the migraine headache days and also a decrease in the number of medication dates that were being used , too. It carries over w ith the mi graine, as well. The last one we have is the Emgality. Again, a couple big studies here and quite a few patie nts. This one's broken 46May 1, 2019 Page 5 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do down in the EVOLVE studies, the EVOLVE 1 and the EVOLVE 2. In the EVOLVE 1, the difference is between the EVOLVE 1 was done just in North America, I think just in the U.S. EVOLVE 2 is more global but you can see again, 9.4% of patients, they looked at a different measure. T his is MMHD instead of the MMD's so it's a lit tle bit different measure, so it can't quite compare these apples to a pples, but 9.4% of patients reported no headache days and then a little bit lower for the EVOLVE 2. When we get into the chronic migraine, however, though with the REGAINE study here, they had a little bit more trouble getting the significance on here. The primary endpoint was the change which favored the Emgality and it significantly increased the proportion of patients that achieved the 50% reduction but the only 0.2 and 0.8% were reporting the migraines cessation versus placebo so this wasn't statistically significant. So, we looked at the number of claims we've had so far. The Aimovig has been on the market for the longest so it has the most number of claims. The Emgality is the n ewest one so only two claims we've had. All the utilization numbers I'll be showing today is Dece mber, January, February of this year so we tried to get the most recent data w e could for the full months. So not a whole lot of utilization of these yet. I will say that the DUR Board has addressed these and have added so me prior authori zation criteria that will go into effect probably May of this year, so we'll have some PA criteria. But, right now Optum recommends that the Board co nsider these clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Shamim Nagy - We need a motion. Motion to accept as clinically and t herapeutically equivalent. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Carl Jeffery - With this new class, this will be a new class that's included in here , so it will be under the neurologi cal agents, anti-migraine agen ts and then the calcitonin gene peptide as the CGRP receptor antagonists. This follows in line with the similar, the triptans that are in there already under the anti-migraine agent system, as well, so they'll be in that same category but their own class. Optum recommends that Aimovig, Ajovy b e considered preferred and Emga lity be non- preferred. Motion to accept Optum's recommendation. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. b. Toxicology Agents - Substance A buse Agents - Withdrawal Agents Shamim Nagy opened this up for public comment. Kelly Barfield - I'm a corporate account director with US Worlds Meds. Thank you for having me today. Today I'd lik e to discuss the merits of Lucemyra and the impact it may have by placing it on the Nevada Fee for Service formulary. Lucemyra is the first and only FDA approved non-addictive, non- opioid medication for the mitigation of opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults. Being that 47May 1, 2019 Page 6 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do Lucemyra is the first and only nonnarcotic agent to treat opioi d withdrawal, compendia has created a new the rapeutic class, MediSpan, First Databank, and Elsevier, Gold Standar d all have Lucemyra as or the therapeutic category agents for opioid withdrawal. I think it's im portant to note that the MATs fall under the class of agents for opioid use disorder. This leads me to what Lucemyra is and is not. Lucemyra is not an MAT and not a treatment for opioid use disorder. It's essential alpha 2 adrenergic ag onist indicated to mitigate with drawal symptoms in adults following the abrupt discontinuation of opioids. Lucemy ra is not another maintenance therapy for patients with opioid use disorder. Lucemyra is not an opioid-based agent tha t would treat craving s for addictive patients suffering from opioid use disorder. So, what is Lucemyra and how could it be used based on the label? Lucemyra could be used f or patients that developed a ph ysical dependence to opioids and with the aid of their provider, ha ve a need to m itigate their physical symptoms of withdrawal. Lucemyra is an acute 7 to 14-day thera py that may be a single treatment for dependent patients experiencing withdrawal from discontinuation of opioids. Lucem yra can be prescribed by primary care physicians that have not recei ved additional tr eatment for OUD. The common theme that is continually discussed on national platform is the need to broaden the options and set a care for patie nts that have developed physica l dependence and/or addiction to opioids. With the approval of Lucemyra, primary c are physicians now have an agent that they can utilize as a frontline provider to safely treat patients they would like to mitigate the physical symptoms of w ithdrawal. It is important to note that the trea tment of opioids role has a critical time window. Patients are highly sensitive to and fearful of opioid-withdraw al symptoms. The physical symptoms of withdr awal maybe get 8 to 12 hours followi ng discontinuation of opioids with a peak of symptoms at days 2 th rough 5. For patients and providers to recognize the full utility that Lucem yra may have to offer is essential that patients have unrestricted acc ess without hav ing to wait 24 to 48 hours for the review and approval of a prior authorization. In closing, Lucemyra provides an opportunity to engage a broad range of providers to address and treat opioid dependence where there has been limited options in the p ast. Thank you. Shamim Nagy opened up for questions. Shamim Nagy - Is this for the use in outpatients? Kelly Barfield - Yeah, it's a g ood question. This is us e for outpatients. Nowhe re in the label does the FDA restrict outpatient utilization. Our trials were conducted in an inpatient setting due to the control factor and that vari able in recording the results of product, but we have vi rtually seen very, very limit ed outpatient utilizations all by a n outpatient so far. Sapandeep Khurana - What's the defensive mechan ism of action between Lucemyra and clonidine? Kelly Barfield - So from an MOA standpoint, there is no difference. Shamim Nagy opened up for public c omment. No public comment. 48May 1, 2019 Page 7 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do Carl Jeffery - I'm not going to spend a lot of time, just repeating what Kelly just said, so basically we've got the Lucemyra , there's a caveat with this one. We don't really see any benefit of listing this as a class and so we would be fine of the board not even accepting this class because right now basically the Lucemyra is the only approved agent for it. Clonidine is medically accepted. It doesn't have an FDA-approved indication for it, but it's medically accepted, and it's listed as common compendia so it's not a problem Medicaid covering it for the withdrawal. You can see the number of cla ims. We don't have any way t o tease out that these are just being used for opioid w ithdrawal so chances are, 99% o f these are being used for blood pressure and children for ADHD so three claims in the past quarter with Lucemyra ; not a whole lot of utilization yet but unless there's a ny discussion from the board or some questions, O ptum recommends the clonidin e and Lucemyra be considered as clini cally and therapeutically equiva lent. Shamim Nagy opened up for discussion or questions from the Board. No questions. Motion to accept as clinically and t herapeutically equivalent. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Carl Jeffery - Like I said, there's really no be nefit to having this class on the PDL at this time. There may be more agents in this class coming on ; at that time, it may be more of a benefit but right now if the board wanted to have a class, our recommendation would be t o have the clonidine and Lucemyra both listed as preferred. Gabriel Lither - Can you explain the options a little bit more so that everybod y understands. The options are to e ither vote with a class and vote which drugs should be in the class , where the alterna tive that you're putti ng forth is the elimination of this class wit h a PDL and what would it take? Carl Jeffery - Yeah, this is a new class and so by not having this class put on there. Medicaid has an open formulary, so we cover everything that is FDA approved and rebatable so by not having this class on here, there's no r estriction. We just don't advertise it as bein g preferred but it's not non-preferred, so we just don't add any additional restriction to it by not putting it on there. C hances are this will likely go to the DUR Board meeting where we will add some prior authori zation criteria for the DUR Board. I think that's a better way to manage this medication rather than the preferred drug list. Shamim Nagy - We already have voting on addi ng this as a new class. Gabriel Lither - We just have voting for the clinical and therapeutic equivalence. Multiple Speakers (indiscernible) Shamim Nagy - Do we have to vote again? 49May 1, 2019 Page 8 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do Joseph Adashek - You don't have to. It's up to us i f you want to vote again. I t doesn't seem like it changes anything anyway so why make it mor e difficult if we don't have to. Gabriel Lither - It's not a class right now. It is a proposed new class. Your options are to create new class with whichever medications you want to do, or your second option is to do nothing. And by Dr. Adashek, that you could by simply doing nothing, I was told it was helpful and clearer if you made a motion to do nothing so it's on the recor d that you are not adopting this new class at this time. Joseph Adashek - Well I am pretty good at doing nothing. It doesn't change anything that we are doing in terms of this \"class,\" we're not making it a class and it seems like it will work the s ame. I vote we make no changes to this non-class. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Joseph Adashek - So did we say that they're clin ically and therapeutically alternatives, but we have to agree with the fac t that it's preferred? Is tha t correct? Carl Jeffery - Right, so you agree that they're clinically and therapeutically equivalent. We just didn't create that new class so that class will not exi st on the PDL going forward with this update. Joseph Adashek - So the DUR might decide that... Holly Long - Right, so maybe we can clarify , too, that if it's not on here, it's not preferred or non-preferred , that's open access to it. It doesn't have to be on the PDL for Medicaid to provide coverage. Carl Jeffery - Why was it brought forward? Carl Jeffery - I think it was a request and the n I think when this first came out, we weren't sure exactly where it would fit in with the therapies a nd doesn't really fit in with the other ones with lik e the Suboxone and those so beca use we have to work so far out in advance... Gabriel Lither - I was going to say, sometimes when they're creating the agendas and they're putting together the materials so far in advance that they don't know whether something should real ly be on the agenda, it's too late and you guys had votes like you just did toni g ht. Holly Long - And, sometimes we don't see the utilization that was supported one way or the other and then of course we always are anticipating other drugs that could possibly be coming to tha t class and if they don't, then we're stuck in that position. Sapandeep Khurana - As a psychiatrist, I would say, I think would warrant a discussion but right now there's not too much to make a class. 50May 1, 2019 Page 9 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do Joseph Adashek - I would hope that DUR would ma ke everything available possible for anything that's i n the class of medication for out patients and f or all the opioids and other cl asses we'll talk about. Holly Long - Sure, that's for DHCFP, they are in support of that and we're doing everything that we can make sure that the substance abuse treat ment is there available for the recipients. Shamim Nagy - That's a very important issu e. We should table this to a future date. Holly Long - Sure, and I can make note to bring it back to the next P&T mee ting if the DUR Board makes any deci sions one way or the other. c. Toxicology Agents - Substance A buse Agents - Opiate Antagonist Extended Release Injections Shamim Nagy opened up for public comment. Kenneth Barry - My name is Dr. Kenneth Barry, I'm from Alkermes . It's a pleasure to be here to talk to y ou. I want to present some clinical information and economic information a bout Vivitrol. We all know that Vivitrol is extended release naltrexone in injectable form and it's used and indicated for opioid use disorder and it should be part of a comprehensive management pr ogram that includes psychosocial support. Now SAMHSA government protocol recommendations for medications for OUD. OUD medication should be available to patients across all settings and at all leve ls of care. All patients considering treatment should be edu cated about effectiv eness, risk, and benefits of each of the three medications used for OUD , which would inc lude methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Medications from different pharmacological cla sses are available for OUD as we mentioned. Vivitrol is not associated with the d evelopment of tolerance or dependenc e. It does not cause disulfiram-like rea ctions resulting from an opiate or alcohol injections and there is no withdrawal synd rome associated with discontinuation of Vivitrol. O piate-dependent patients in cluding those being treatment for alcohol use disorder should be opiate free for 7 to 10 days prior to initiating Vivitrol. A few clinical studies to consider, one's published in JAMA Psychiatry in 2017. The effect of V ivitrol versus Suboxone for opiate dependence. This was a 12-week clinical tri al of 232 opiate-dependent indivi duals to determine whether treatment with Vi vitrol w ill be as effective as Suboxon e and maintaining short-term abstinence from heroin or other illicit drugs. The study found that both drugs were equivalent in maintaining abstinence from heroin and other illicit opiates in the study. Some seconda ry measures with participant s receiving Vivitrol received less cravin g and thoughts about heroin and ha d higher patient satisfaction compared to Suboxone patients in the trial. There were no deaths recorded in the study and the one overdose occurred in a Suboxo ne-treated patient. The next study was published i n Lancet 2018. It was better known as XPOT or comparative effectiveness of V ivitrol versus Suboxone for opiat e relapse prevention. This was a 24-week study compared to the effective ness trial of 570 51May 1, 2019 Page 10 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do patients with opiate use disorder and had used nonprescription opiates within 30 days prior to the trial. The res ults show that Vivitrol was as effective as Suboxone treatment in maintaining patients relapse free among participan ts who were inducted. The 24-week relapse of events were similar across all study groups but the self-reported opiate cravings was initially less with Vivit rol but they did merge at 24 weeks with the Suboxone g roup, as well. Adverse events including overdose did not differ between the two groups. Overdose fatalities occ urred in three participants in the Suboxone arm and two in the Vivitrol arm. Now recent pharmacoeconomic data tha t was published in the Journal of Medi cal Economics in 2018 was a 12-month retrospectiv e analysis of insurance clai ms. Gabriel Lither - I'm not sure exactly where you're g oing with the e conomic data, but it's important to note, this committee does not consider economic factors in its decision. So, it's beneficial for us; we're actually not suppose d to hear of documented information. Kenneth Barry - Okay, I can scratch that. Gabriel Lither - Just a reminder that you're curre ntly on the approved portion of the diagram up there. Kenneth Barry - Okay, makes my job even easier , especially when I get home, I like this. So, I just wanted t o thank you for your time today and your support for Vivitrol for patients with addiction. Any questions? Sapandeep Khurana - Is it approved only for opiate disorder or alcohol and opiate abuse disorder? Kenneth Barry - It's approved for alc ohol use disorder and opiate use disorder. Shamim Nagy opened up for public c omment. There were none. Carl Jeffery - Let me start off by saying th at the Board has some decisions t o make with this class, as well. T his is a new class. We also h ave on the agenda to discuss the Suboxone, the Z ubsolv, and the naloxone and the buprenorphine combinations. These two products would fit nicely into that cl ass and so when we get down a little bit further, I a ctually have a couple scenari os proposed when we get to that class that this be included in there. Also, we rec ommended they be added as preferred in that whol e class. So if the Board would like to skip this section and wait until we get down with the other buprenorphine -naloxone products, we could discuss adding those with the wh ole class or if the Board so desires to have this as a separat e class, it's totally up to th e Board. We have felt that it would fit nicely into t he other ones, the buprenorphine -naloxone combination products. We hear d about the Vivitrol, but I will just give my spiel about the S ublocade. It's an extended rel ease buprenorphine product. It' s dosed at 300 mg monthly for the first 2 mont hs and then the dose is adju sted after that. You can go to 100 mg up to 300 mg dose once a month. They should b e stabilized on the sublingual buprenorphine pr oduct before adjusting this, but it has been shown to be superior to placebo and achie ving the more illicit opioid 3 weeks. 52May 1, 2019 Page 11 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do Gabriel Lither - I was just wondering, Carl, c an you explain why you think this might feel well in a different cla ss and what change between th e time you proposed perhaps the new class and the idea now that it might b e better fit in a preexisting class. Carl Jeffery - Just to give my thunder away here, what we do is change the cl ass so currently the other one is a mixed opioid antagonist for sub stance abuse agents. What we do is create a single cl ass that would be substance abu se agents and then we would list the Sublocade and t he Vivitrol as we ll as all the buprenorphine- naloxone products in there. What it does is simplify just the class as far as administration and also from the provider standpoint, there is less for them to review I think as far as what is on the preferred drug list. I think it would make it simpler from the provider sta ndpoint as well as having it just under a single class so that was kind of our thought a nd it's indicated for the same thing. Often times these are interchangeable. As you can see, the Sublocade, they also need to be on the buprenorphine or al product, as well, during initiation. Shamim Nagy - Should wait to discuss this agai n when we get to the other cla ss? Gabriel Lither - To make it clear, just have a m otion that would be helpful, a motion to either adopt this new class now or to include these m edications in the other class, so would we agree with doing that, would take it t o the next class which is similar to this class next or to include it all at onc e, or would it be better just to make a motion to include them all in the same class, op ioid antagonist? Joseph Adashek - I think if you want to, we can just move the agenda around, as well, we can go to the other clas s right now, hear what we have to do about them and the class and then mak e a motion on this class. Shamim Nagy - I think that would be clearer . Could we do that and move onto the next class? Carl Jeffery - I think it's a good idea. Kate Ward - When someone is talking, can the y state their name before they make their statement because it's hard to follow you guys back and f orth without wondering who's talking. Joseph Adashek - I move that we talk about the s imilar class next and then we c an decide to whether one cate gory ... Do w e need a second for that? Gabriel Lither - The chair controls t he agenda so you can move forward with tha t at this time. Carl Jeffery - Okay so, I have pulled up here t he preferred and non-preferred drugs as we would propose it if the cla ss remains the mixed opioid agonist-antagonists if we decide to update the w hole class to just substance abuse agents and include the Sublocade and Vivitrol, this is our proposed class of how it would look. What brought this class back is there is a new generic for the Suboxone and so we would 53May 1, 2019 Page 12 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do include the generic as the non-preferred and just still prefer the brand name for now. Kate Ward - I was wondering as far as the different routes and administrat ion if combining all of them together would be more confusing and woul d then lead to not choosing the simplest whic h would be the oral form or if th ey advocate that it was noncompliant, they would wan t to (indiscernible), probably be more of a route option rather than them alto gether (indiscernible). Carl Jeffery - I think it's certainly worthy of discussion. I favor the single class and so I think it's just simpler . I think Dr. Ward has a legitimate point there. I think it would be clearer as far as a route of a dministration injectable versus oral. This is how I think i t's simpler. Shamim Nagy - So I see like an oral class, injectables, single, and combinat ion agents in the same class. Ther e are combinations there, too. Carl Jeffery - That's why for this class, we would remove the mixed, and you c an see that the previous one we ha ve, they are the mixed opioid ag onist-antagonists and so we would remove the mixed part of it and just substance abuse agents. Sapandeep Khurana - Carl I was wondering within the class, is it possible to have orals and injectables list to c ategories two categories. Carl Jeffery - It would help just to put a list after them. I'm trying to thi nk how that would look on the preferred drug list, m aybe an injectable product or oral. I'm trying to think of how that would look best. Shamim Nagy - Okay, so you think it's okay? Carl Jeffery - Yeah, that was our r ecommendation but certa inly I think it's worthy of discussion. I think Dr. Ward raised a good point. I think it's worthy of the Board's consideration and discussion. Shamim Nagy presented a motion. Discussion of changin g the name of the c lass to opioid dependen cy treatment agents. Joseph Adashek - I move that we include this cla ss of medications all in the sa me class, at this time just substance abuse agents. Second. Voting: Ayes are una nimous. Motion carries. Public comment opened f or toxicology/substance abuse agents. There were none. Carl Jeffery - We have wha t broug ht this back is the addition of the Suboxone generic. It's available now a nd I put it on the utilization st atistics here. Suboxone brand is still by far the most used, almost 1000 claims in the past quarter. Optum 54May 1, 2019 Page 13 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do recommends the Board c onsider the medications listed here clini cally and therapeutically equivalent. Motion to accept Optum's recommendation. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Carl Jeffery - Optum recommends that the Boar d update this class to include t he Bunavail, the Sublocade, the S uboxone, Vivitrol, and Zubsolv as preferred and then the generic buprenorphine-naloxone, both the film and the tablet form as non- preferred . I think we can update renaming the classes well if that's something the Board would like. Motion to accept Optum's recommendation. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. 5. Established Drug Classes Being R eviewed Due to the Release of N ew Drugs a. Anti-infective Agents - Antivirals - Influenza Agents Shamim Nagy presented this cl ass and opened up for discussion t o the public. There were none. Carl Jeffery - Xofluza is a new medication, like the Tamiflu agents. It's an endonuclease. Works kind of the same way and just a little bit different. Indicated for patients 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms no mo re than 48 hours, similar to the Tamiflu. Stud y was about 1400 patients shown and compared to placebo and Tamiflu, shown to be noni nferior or actually about the same similarity between the Tamiflu a nd the Xofluza. What was a little bit dif ferent was the Xofluza was slightly better at not having so many of the side e ffects that come with the Tamiflu. I don't know when Xofluza was available on the market, but the last quarter we don't have any claims for it. It's right in the flu season so we're looking at December, January, a nd February so expect to see a g ood number of claims for these whic h is not huge. Amantadine I'm guessing, I don't think it's being used a whole lot this year. I've heard it's not real effective this year for the flu virus that's going around this year , so it may be used for other non-flu issues. Still not a huge numbe r of claims here for a quarter but those are our utilization. Optum recommends the drugs in thi s class be considered clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Motion to accept as clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Carl Jeffery - Optum recommends the new drug , Xofluza, be added to the preferred drug list as non-preferred and keep the rest of the c lass the same. Shamim Nagy opened for que stions/discussion. Joseph Adashek - For the m edication, Xofluz a, wha t kind of antiviral is that? Is it similar to any of the other agents? 55May 1, 2019 Page 14 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do Carl Jeffery - Yeah, it is similar to the Tamiflu. It's a little bit differen t class but it works the same way as Tamiflu. T he difference with the Xofluza as far as the dosing goes, it's just a one -time dose so you get the flu symptoms and it's a one - time dose whereas the Tamiflu 7 t o 10 days therapy. It's a little bit different and a little bit easier that way. Joseph Adashek - A one-time dose, can I ask you, who do you think honestly would be taking much more readily than Tamiflu and less likely to get influenza complications in this one- time dose? If you chose it, us ually it's for economic reasons, I know we don't want to discuss that, for reasons that it could be other than the reason I just said. Carl Jeffery - It's only approved to 12 and older whereas Tamiflu I think is down to 2 I think. Joseph Adashek - I just don't know enough about it in terms of saying, should it be preferred or... if anyone up north, i f they want to make a motion to prefer. Educate me on it other than the fact that it's a one-time dose. Holly Long - Dr. Crumby or Kate Ward, can y ou speak to what Dr. Adashek is asking? Kate Ward - Yeah, it does seem as though it has similar efficacy it obviou sly doesn't compare to Tamiflu but it does seem to be compara ble to Tamiflu in efficacy and needs to be take n over an appropria te period of ti me with the diagnosis of influenza. Beyond reason, although we cannot discuss it, I believe that they would be able to b e chosen interchangeably. Sapandeep Khurana - I think with one dose, people w ill not get better any sooner now they're taking 10 doses t o 1 dose and the second responses. Joseph Adashek : If you don't take a full course of Tamiflu, do you have the same risk of resistance as with antibiotics? Kate Ward - So really you want to take th e most effective course and not t he entire course that's written so with it, with Tamiflu, there's an amount to whether or not you really need to continue to take the entire course if you're no longer having symptoms. Again, the prescription is going to be filled for the entire course that's written so it doesn't go from a patient standpoint, they 're going to get the entire course it's written for. In the form you get, the Tamiflu, you get one dose for treatment. Joseph Adashek - I understand that, but say the pa tient feels better and only takes the tablet for 5 days, is there a n increased risk of resistance for example than there would be for antibio tics or only takes tw o days of antibiotics for whatever; for a MRSA infection, there is more re sistance if you want to take it two days as opposed to the entire course, woul d you say that is similar to Tamiflu or not necessarily? 56May 1, 2019 Page 15 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do Kate Ward - No, it wouldn't be. It w ouldn't be comparable. Joseph Adashek - My next question is, aga in, if Tamiflu's for 7 days or 10 days, are you taking 10 times the medi cation needed than if you were to take the one- time dose in Xofluza. Once you're taking 10 times the medicati on or say 10 days of Tamiflu, versus 1 day of Xoflu za, does that impact the decis ion? Kate Ward - No, when I looked at it, as far as average goes, it was well t olerated. Joseph Adashek - I think that th e medication that you take onc e in one pill would be beneficial, more likely to be taken, more likely tolerated, the side effects grasped, so I would make it a preferred agent. I make a motion that that it would be a preferred agent. Gabriel Lither - Your motion is to accept the re commendations with the exceptio n of moving Xofluza from non-pref erred to preferred correct? Joseph Adashek - I apologize and that is correct. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Xofl uza moves to preferred. b. Autonomic Agents - Sympathomimetics - Self-injectable Epinephri ne Shamim Nagy opened f or public comment. T here were none. Carl Jeffery - We have a new product, Symjepi . This one is a little bit different than the other ones that are available. It's a prefi lled syringe and not an auto-injector like the Epi- Pens or even the generic epinephrine that's available. It looks like a Lovenox syringe. Right now, we don't have any claims for it in the past quarter . The generic epinephrine, which is our preferred agent, of course, has the bulk of the claims. You ha ve a couple of Epi-Pens, one Epi-Pen prescription, so again seems like it is r ight in line with what we expected with how our preferred drug list is. We have another one that's on the market, A uvi-Q. This product does not participate in the Federal Drug Rebate Program, which is a requirement from CMS, so we hav e it up here, even though Medicaid can't cov er it. Optum recommends that the Board consider these clinically and t herapeutically equivalent. Motion to accept as clinically a nd therapeutically equivalent. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Carl Jeffery - Optum recommends that the new product, the Symjepi, be considered non-preferred in this class and keep the rest of the class the same. Joseph Adashek - Why was Symjepi invented then? It's such a similar medication to the others. Is there any reason why that is even on the market? Mark Crumb y - Cheaper. 57May 1, 2019 Page 16 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do Motion to accept Optum's recommendation. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. c. Hormones and Hormone Modifiers - Androgens Shamim Nagy opened this class fo r discussion a nd public comment . There was none. Carl Jeffery - This will be a fast one, too. The re are two new generic produ cts on the market and that's what prom pted us to bring this one back. There's also a new injectable product. It's calle d Xyosted. It's an injectable testosterone. It didn't make it to our numbers in time t o really do a full review, so w e may see it on again in the future but right now, we're just talking about the two n ew generics and that's why we're talking a bout this one. The testoste rone gel is the g eneric for the AndroGel and the testosterone sol ution is the generic for the A xiron. Both of those are newly available. The other products with the testosterone gel have already been available for a while and t hose are out there in the market. You see our utilization. Not a whole lot of utilization on this one. When I show the slide, it's highlighted and the AndroGel. Opt um recommends the Board consider adding the AndroGel as the non-preferred. There were 10 c laims in the qua rter, so I don't think it's going to impact those three members or so that they could either switch to the Androderm or we could gra ndfather them in with the Andro Gel but shouldn't be a big problem to switch over to the Androderm. Th e two new products, we have one already for the A xiron and the other ge neric doesn't have any utilization yet. A lot of the other ones don' t have utiliz ation, either. Optum recommends the Board c onsider these clinically and therapeutica lly equivalent. Motion to accept as clinically and t herapeutically equivalent. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Carl Jeffery - I think one of the bigger changes since the generics came out, it gave Optum a chance to really review these again. We are going to r ecommend that the brand AndroGel be removed from preferred and added as non-prefe rred and then the new testosterone solution and the new testosterone gel whic h has already been listed on there but the new solutio n would also be added as non-preferred. Shamim Nagy presented motion. Kate Ward - We'll only have a solution ava ilable and not the gel available as preferred? Carl Jeffery - Yes that's rig ht. The advantag e of onl y having a single prefer red agent, though, is they just to n eed to try that one before movi ng into a non- preferred agent. Joseph Adashek - I don't prescribe this as all my patients are pregnant, is that a problem with anyone up North, AndroG el is now taken off preferred? 58May 1, 2019 Page 17 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do Motion to accept Optum's recommendation. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. d. Ophthalmic Agents - Antiglaucoma Agents Shamim Nagy opened f or public comment. T here was no public com ment. Carl Jeffery - We have a new antiglaucoma agen t, as the Board may remember, we combined all of the classes into all just one big antiglauco ma agent class a while ago. We have t wo new products that are on the market, on e generic. We have the generic for the Cosopt-PF which is preservative-free, the dorzolamide and Timolol ophthalmic solution. It's just a new generic and nothing real special about that one. The other one is the Xe lpros and it's a latanoprost emulsion and what makes it different from the Xalatan or the generic latanoprost that's currently available is that it's the benzalkonium free products. I think the result, there may be some patients who have kind of a sensitivity to the BAK prod uct in there but they won't know that until they try it usua lly. It has a similar efficacy to Xalatan when it was studied. We have all of the different classes here . You can see the latanoprost generic, by far th e most utilized in its class, almost 600 claims in the past quarter. All the other ones are around 100 claims for the most popular like the timolol or the Travatan-Z are 170, 164 claims respectively, so not a huge utilization for outside the la tanoprost in the past quarter. This is a slide for the clinically and therapeutically equivalent. I have it broken dow n by class. There is another ROCK inhibitor that I think did get approved in the las t couple of weeks, so we'll probably be seeing this class again, if not the next meeting but the meeting after. Optum recommends the Boar d consider these clinically an d therapeutically equivalent. Shamim Nagy opened up for discussion. Motion to accept as clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Carl Jeffery - Optum recommends the new generic, the dorzolamide and the timolol be added as non- preferred as well as the new product, the Xelpros be added as non-preferred; keep the r est of the class the same. Shamim Nagy opened up for discussion. Motion to accept Optum's recommendation. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. e. Ophthalmic Agents - Ophthalmics for Dry Eye Disease Shamim Nagy opened f or public discussion. No public comment. Carl J effery - Another new drug in its class, C equa, it's another cyclosporin like the other ones. Its selling point is that it's formulated a li ttle bit different. It's in a solution versus an emulsion with the other ones. It's formulated a little bit 59May 1, 2019 Page 18 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do different. They use micro-nano technology, but it's supposed to be absorbed in the eye a little bit better than some of the other ones. I saw and I was on the website this morning reviewing these and even on the website it said that it's not yet available so I'm not sure that the pharmacies have seen this ye t but it is available from our clinical team and then f or our review. But, it's indicated like the other ones to increase tear productio n in patients with the keratocon junctivitis sicca. Similar to the other products, I put all the other indications up here for the Restasis and the Xiidra that are up there. We have about 1000 patients in the trial versus just the vehicle. There's no hea d-to-head studies versus aga inst the Restasis or the Xiidra but after 84 days, 17% of the Cequa treate d patients ver sus 9% of the vehicle-treated patients achiev ed their endpoint which is great er than 10 mm from baseline and then the smear wetting test. I n my eyes, this doesn't seem all that effective anyway, and I think it's in line with the other ones but that's not great numbers in my mind. You can see t he utilization. The Restasis multidose is kind of greyed out there because these numbers, if the Board remembe rs last time we reviewed this in November, we ma de the multidose file non-prefe rred and so the numbers here are from be fore the Board and it's non-preferred, so the 103 on here likely shifted over to the regular Restasis individual vials. No use for the Cequa yet. As I mentioned, it's probably not available yet and just a few for the Xiidra. Optum recommends the Board consid er these clinically and therap eutically equivalent. Motion to accept as clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Carl Jeffery - Optum recommends that the new product, the Ce qua, be added as non-preferred and the rest of the class remai n the same. Motion to accept Optum's recommendation. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. 6. Established Drug Classes a. Toxicology Agents - Substance Abuse Agents - Mixed Opiate Agonists/Antagonists (Oral) Carl Jeffery - I just was going to mention to the Board, it has nothing to do with the decision, there is a new drug that's another combination of buprenorphine - naloxone product that's suppose d to be in the works, the Cassip a is its tradename. They just h aven't released it. We may see this class again here soon , but we'll skip ahead to the next clas s. b. Ana lgesics - Analgesic/Miscellane ous - Neuropathic Pain/Fibromy algia Agents Shamim Nagy opened up for public c omment. No public comment. Carl Jeffery - We have a new Lyrica-CR. I always find it amazing that these drug companies manage to come out with an extended r elease product a bout the time the regular-release product is going to come off patent, so it's incredible how 60May 1, 2019 Page 19 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do they're developi ng these product s works. The new Lyrica-CR is once a day instead of 2 or 3 times a day and a gain the same indication for the Lyrica. Like I said, there's a generic that's in the pipeline, I think we shou ld see it here soon. The other product was ne w; I don't know how n ew it is. It just popped up on our clinical review. It's a Qutenza. It's a capsaicin patch and this is the first I'd seen it, but it's indicated for the relief of pain a ssociated with the p eripheral neuropathy. It's a little bit different in that it's applied for 60 minutes at a time, up to 4 patches every 3 months and then it can only be administered by a physic ian or a healthcare professional. This one sounds a little bit weird as far as the administration of it. You can see our utilization, gabapen tin is always one of Nevada Medicaid's population's most favorite dr ugs. It shows up in one of our hi ghest utilization for the non-opioids. The numbers reflect that. The Lyrica is not quite as popular but still quite a few cla ims, almost 2100 claims for the Lyrica in the last quarter and only 6 claims so far with the L yrica-CR. Optum recommends the Board consider this class clinically and the rapeutically equivalent. Shamim Nagy presented the topi c for discussion. No discussion. Motion to accept as clinically and t herapeutically equivalent. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Carl Jeffery - Optum recommends that the ne w Lyrica-CR be added as non- preferred and then since the Qutenza would only be administered in a doct or's office, there won't be any impact here but it would just be a good idea to add it as non-preferred just in case a local pharmacy trie s to run it, just so it's a little bit more clearer that way, but the Qutenza be added as non-preferre d, as well. Sapandeep Khurana - Is Savella a preferred drug only for fibromyalgia as it states ? Carl Jeffery - Yes, that's right. It's only indicated for fibromyalgia. I don't think it has the neuropathic pain indication like some of the other o nes do so I think that's why it h as that caveat. Motion to accept Optum's recommendation. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. c. Anti-infective Agents - Antivirals - Anti-hepatitis Agents - Po lymerase Inhibitors/Combination Products Shamim Nagy opened up the discussion for public comment. Laura Hill - My name is Laura Hill. I'm with Medical Affairs and AbbVie. We're the compan y that manufacturers Mavyret. I just really wa nted to come up in case you had any questions. Thank you. Carl Jeffery - We have two new authorized generics from Gilead here. There's the generic for the Epclusa and the generic for Harvoni. These wer e just released a few months ago. The Viekira-XR and Technivie from AbbVie is vo luntarily discontinued from the manufact urer. Our plan is not to remove those quite yet 61May 1, 2019 Page 20 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do from our preferred drug list, but t hey probably will be coming but we'll let anybody who's maybe going to con tinue therapy or maybe if there 's some product on the shelf we don't want to be hasty about removing those pro ducts. The generics for the Epclusa and the Harvoni are the same and actua lly made by the same company. No problems with t hose. You can see the utilization numbers here for the last quarter and so the Epclusa and the Harvoni an d the Mavyret actually have quite a few claims on there. Optum makes the rec ommendation the Board consider this class clinically and therapeutically equiva lent. Shamim Nagy opened up for disc ussion. No discussion was heard. Motion to accept as clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. Carl Jeffery - With the new generics on the mar ket, Optum recommends the new generic for Epclusa and generic for Harvoni be added as preferr ed and the rest of the class remain the same. Motion to accept Optum's recommendation. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. d. Dermatological Agents - Topical Anti-Infectives - Topical Antif ungals (Onychomycosis) Shamim Nagy opened the class fo r public discussion. No public comment. Carl Jeffery - We brought this back a couple of times because we're trying to figure out what the class shoul d be. This is the last class. The antifungal so, onychomycosis agents, these are only agents that are used to treat toenail fungus. It's g enerally what they are on infre quently for fingernail fungus. Optum sees no benefit to managing this cla ss on the preferred drug list and so Optum's recommendation is just to eliminate this class from the preferred drug list and as we discussed with the Lucemyra is that it just creates open acc ess. There is prior authorization requirements for a lot of these agents already fo r like the Jublia and some of the other medications of the topical med ications, so it's not like they wouldn't just be uncontrolled but they would be still limited to those who should be best getting them. You can see the utilization of these. T he therapy of these agents is a long time for not a whole lot of success rate with these, so still pretty low success and you can see pe ople have to be on these for 48 w eeks before they have a moderate reduc tion or moderate contro l of their toenail fungus. With the oral agents and I think some of the confusion is because we hav e it listed as a topical antifung al, I think our i ntention was that the fung us is topical and not everything is applied topical a nd I think it was creating some of the confusion because there are oral agents included in there. You can see t hat the oral agents are proven successful . They're a little bit more successful i n treating this than the topical agents but the n there are side effects with them, as we ll. We look at the utilization, the terbinafine can be used for other things, too, although it's probably mostly being used for the toena il fungus and then the ciclopirox is the number one 62May 1, 2019 Page 21 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do utilizer as far as the topical t reatments go. There's no benef it to having this as a managed class because everythin g we have on here is generic and so our generic first program would kind of take over from not having this clas s on there. Joseph Adashek - I would agree with Optum's reco mmendations that this is no longer considered a class. Motion to accept Optum's recommendation. Second. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The motion carries. 7. Report by OptumRx on New Drugs to Market, New Generic Drugs to Market, and New Line Extensions Carl Jeffery - We've got a couple ne w nasal spray. I'm sure this is getting a lot of press coverage, the esketamine, the Spravato nasal spray. I don't know if this is going to be on our preferred drug list. Eventually, it is pretty unique on where it fits in and the therapy is really only for treatment-resistant major depressive disorders. From what I hear, it works very rapidly and has been successful for the relatively small group of people and this is really geared towards. It do ses twice a week during the induction and then once a week for the maintenance phase. The other two new products are both ADHD medications. I'm not sure why we need more, another methylphenidate product, another amphetami ne product, so we'll pr obably be seeing those in the future. Again, a c ouple new generi cs, Advair Diskus is now approved as generic and we'll be seeing t hose coming up here as well as the Proair, the Ventolin, and I believe the third new one coming out, too, and the Renage l as well as a new generic so these will all be a little foreshadowing where we'll be coming for future meetings. Joseph Adashek - There's a new postpartum de pression, over 60 hours , we'll have to discuss that correct? Carl Jeffery - Physician-administered drug c laims, we call them PAD claims, they're not bound by our preferre d drug list and so that one wo uld be given through a physician- administered drug. It's usually given right after the baby is born right? Joseph Adashek - Well , it's best given for postpartum depression when diagnosed. It could be a couple weeks later, a month later. Kate Ward - It requires the healthcare fac ility to administer because of t he adverse effects that we're seeing so , it is given in the hospital. Joseph Adashek - If there' s 2 people out of 250, they got out of bed too fast to go to the bathroom, I read those wher e to the two adverse events. Th at was the reason it is given in a healthcare facility. Sapandeep Khurana - For the esketamine , if the pharmacy ha s claimed now, what's the status that it would go through? 63May 1, 2019 Page 22 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do Carl Jeffery - Yeah, this is not restricted r ight now so you have to take out a claim for it. I can't think of anything that would stop it. I don't know that it's been loaded yet, though, I don't know if it's in the system yet. Sapandeep Khurana - So would it come through or not? Carl Jeffery - There wouldn't be any approval . The claim would just go through without any kind of restrictions so there is no approval proces s. It is on our list. We will bring it to the DUR Board. I think it merits restriction. I don't think it should be open access to everybody. There's some monitoring that needs to go along with it, and not everybody has treatment for major depressive disorder, so I think from what they're saying, there's certa inly a limited number of people who have tried and failed other more traditional therapies before they moved to this product. Sapandeep Khurana - You are correct, tr eatment is the defin ition of TRD and this i s the study of indication of failu re of two antidepressants. Carl Jeffery - And so, two SSRI failures, proba bly a lot of people. A couple of new drugs coming out of the pipeline. I don't know what's with the nasal spray focus but metoclopramide nasal sp ray, this is interesting as it is only f or adult women for acute and recurrent diabetic gastropa resis, so it would be interestin g to see how this one comes out and if we'll address it. Dosed at 4 times a day so s till frequent with this one. New medication that's coming out for the plaque psoriasis. I t hought this one looked promising. It's a new subQ IL-23. This one is dosed every 12 weeks, so I think it's promising that it's not having to be given very freq uently. Superior to Humira and Stelara which may have some promise to and then this other new one, the last one on here, is a new one for the S MA, which is muscul ar atrophy type 1. We've got a couple of other products that are on the market. It's a novel gene therapy which I think this one looks promising. A one-time infu sion and I think we can discuss cost with this one since we're not deciding about covering it or not but 2 million dollars for the a dministration of this one-time infusio n. A lot of money with this one coming out but I think if it's effective, and s o they studied it in 12 patients, all 12 of them after 2 years, haven't declin ed at all, so I think it shows a lot of promise and if we're going to ge t that much effect out of it, maybe it's worthwhile, but I think we're jus t ge tting the tip of this new ge ne therapy with these other medications coming out. Shamim Nagy opened for public comment. Daniel Deck - Hello my name is Daniel Deck. I'm a clinical pharmacist by trai ning. I work with the medical affai rs division at Paratek Pharmaceuticals and I just wanted to take 2 or 3 minutes of your time to introduce you to a new a ntibiotic that helps address the challenge of antibio tic resistance. Omadacycline is a modernized tetracycline antibiotic that is F DA approved for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. It's available in both an IV and oral formulation which will help facilitate discharge from the hospital on t he same antibiotic and really f ocused on the resistance piece. It's structura lly distinct from other tetrac yclines and allows it to 64May 1, 2019 Page 23 Nevada Department of Health and Human Services Helping People -- It's Who We Are And What We Do overcome the common tetracycline-resistant mechanisms that we s ee that affect the older tetracycline antibiotics. As we know in the disease stat es of skin and soft tissue infection and community- acquired pneumonia, resistance is a growing challenger and as we kno w, some of the other options there are growing safety concerns with the fluoroquinolones and the black box warning. Omadacycline has activity against all the common c ommunity-acquired pneumonia pa thogens including strep pneumo, Haemophilus , including islets that are resistant to other antibiotics and in the skin and soft tissue infection world, we're active a gainst MRSA and group A strep. Notably ol der tetracyclines are not ac tive against many islets of strep. We also have invitro activity against E coli including islets that are multidrug resistant. What those produce, extend the spectrum b eta-lactomases, VRE, the safety and efficacy of omadacycline against these micr oorganisms has not been established. The tetracyclin e class also has a much lower incidence of C. diff which is a growing problem. It contributes the burden of cost in the hospital and so we look forward to coming back at some point when we're bein g considered for review to talk to you at grea ter length about that. 8.

Therapeutic Class Overview Levodopa Combinations INTRODUCTION Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neu rodegenerative disorder caused by progressive dopamine depletion in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain and characte rized by the cardinal manifest ations of tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Although traditionally recognized as a mot or disorder, PD is a complex m ultifactorial condition that als o includes neuropsychiatric and other non-motor manifestat ions. Approximately 500,000 peopl e in the United States have PD and an estimated 50,000 new cases are diagnosed annually (Chou 2018, National Institute of Health [NIH] 2010). Current treatment options for PD include . The dopamine precursor levodopa is the most effective drug for the symptomatic treatment o f PD and is the first choice if symptoms, especially bradykinesia, become troublesome. Levod opa is combined with the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa to block its conversion to dopamine in the systemic circulation and liver prior to crossing the blood- brain barrier. This prevents nausea, vomiting, and orthostatic hypotension (Tarsy 2018b). Levodopa-induced complications dev elop levodopa in a subst non), dyskinesia, and dystonia. It is estimated that these motor complications occur in a t least 50% of patients after 5 t o 10 years of levodopa treat ment. The risk of motor complications increases with h igher levodopa doses and younger age of PD onset (Tarsy 2018b). Treatment strategies for managing levodopa-induced dyskinesia i nclude adjusting the levodopa doses and dosing schedule or adding an additional antiparkinson medication. For patients who fail oral and tran sdermal medical therapies, other options include deep brain stimulation, continuous carbid opa-levodopa intestinal gel infusion, and continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (Tarsy 2018a). Levodopa several formulat ions. Immediate-release (IR) tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (ODT), and controlled-rele ase (CR) table ts are available in multiple strengths. Rytary, an extended- release (ER) capsule, contains microbeads of carbidopa and levo dopa that, after dissolving, are absorbed a t different rates. Stalevo tablets include entacapone, a COMT inhibitor, to prolong and potentiate the le vodopa effect; spension, is given as a continuous infusion for patients with motor fluctuations in adv anced PD (Tarsy 2018b). The newest levodopa product, Inbrija, is an inhalation powder intended to be used as an adju nct to oral carbidopa/levodopa therapy for the intermittent treatment of OFF episodes.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Carbidopa/levodopa Although the efficacy of levodopa in PD has been widely established in clinical practice , there have been few placebo- controlled (PC) studies evaluati ng its effects. A systematic review of the available eviden ce concluded that levodopa is clinically efficacious as mo notherapy for symptomatic PD (Fox et al 2018) . A Cochrane Review of trials comparing DAs (with or without levodopa) vs pla cebo and/or levodopa in patients with early PD demonstrated that while patients on a DA were less likely to develop d yskinesia, dystonia, or motor f luctuations, symptomatic control of PD was better with levodopa. Adverse effects (AEs) such as edema, somnolence, cons tipation, dizziness, and hallucinations were also increased in DA-treated patients vs levodopa-treated patients (Stowe et controlled trial (RCT), evaluated the effect of levodopa on the rate of p rogression of PD in 361 pati ents with early PD for 42 weeks. Patients were randomized to either carbidopa/levodopa (3 different doses) or placebo therapy. The primar y outcomes were the change in Unified Parkinson Disease Ra ting Scale (UPDRS) scores and th e percent change in the ratio of the specific striatal [123I]-CIT uptake to the nondisplaceable striatal [123I]-CIT uptake between the two images (prior to baseline and at week 40). The mean difference bet ween the total score on the UPDRS was 7.8 units in the placebo group, 1.9 units in the groups receiving levodopa a t a dose of 150 mg/day and 300 mg/day, and -1.4 units in thos e receiving 600 mg/day (p < 0.001). The mean percent decline in the [123I]-CIT uptake was significantly g reater with levodopa than placeb o (-6%, - 68 Data as of January 16, 2019 CME/KAL Page 3 of 8 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The patients receiv ing the highest dose of lev odopa had significantly more dyskinesia, hypertonia, infecti on, headache, and nausea than th ose receiving placebo. The authors concluded that from a clinical perspective, the ELLDOPA study did not find that lev odopa hastens the progression of PD. Small doses were found to be effective, although less so than higher doses (The Parkinson Study Group 2004) . A 5-year, MC, DB, parallel-group, RCT compared the long-term clinical and safety effects of IR and CR carbidopa/levodopa in 618 levodop a-na\u00efve PD patients. The mean dose of IR medication afte r 5 years was 426 \u00b1 205 mg/day and 510 \u00b1 224 mg/day for the bioavailable dose of CR med ication (p = 0.02). After 5 years, 20.6% of the IR group and 21.8% of the CR group had motor fluc tuations or dyski nesia (not statistically signi ficant). The prevalence of AEs did not differ between the tr eatment arms. The authors conc luded that despite the progressive nature of PD, both the IR and CR formulations of car bidopa/levodopa maintained sim ilar control in PD after 5 y ears. The low incidence of motor fluctuations or dyskinesia was not significantly differen t between treatment groups and may be partly attributed to the relatively low doses of levodopa used throughout the trial (Koller et al 1999). Carbidopa/levodopa + entacapone The efficacy and safety of adjuvant COMT inhibitor therapy (ent acapone or tolcapone) to carbidopa/levodopa therapy were examined in a Cochrane Revi ew of 14 RCTS of PD patients wi th motor fluctuations ( N = 2566). Eight trials examined entacapone 200 mg added to each levodopa dose vs place bo in 1560 patients. Compared with placebo, entacapone significantly reduced le vodopa dose (weighted mean difference: 55 mg/day; p < 0.00001), reduced OFF- time (difference: minutes; p = 0.004), and improved UPDRS ac tivities of daily living and motor scores (p < 0.05 for both). Entacapone also significant ly increased the risk of dysk inesia, nausea, vomiting, dia rrhea, constipation, and dizziness (p 0.01 for all). T olcapone was shown to provide si milar benefits in relieving levodopa-induced complications, but also raised liver enzyme levels in some pati ents (Deane et al 2004). Due to risk of liver toxicity, tolcapone should only be used in PD patients who are not respo nding satisfactorily to or are not appropriate candidates fo r other adjunctive therapies (Tolcapone prescribing information 2018). Duopa The efficacy and safety of Duo pa were evaluated in 3 clinical t rials of patients with adv anced PD who had persistent motor fluctuations despite optim ized treatment with oral carbid opa/levodopa. The primary efficacy measure was mean change in OFF-time from basel ine to the end of the study. ON-ti mes with and without dyskine sias were also measured. In a 12-week, DB, PC, RCT, patients (N = 71) were randomized to receive Duopa or placebo per percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jej unal tube (PEG-J). Those who e in the Duopa group received placebo IR carbidopa/levodopa and those in t he placebo intestinal gel infu sion group received active IR carbidopa/levodopa. Duopa demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in OFF -time compared with IR carbidopa/levodopa (-4.04 -1.91 hours; p = 0.0015). Duopa was associated with a statistically significantly gr eater improvement than IR carbido pa/levodopa in ON-time without troublesome urs, respectively; treatment difference: p = 0.0059) and in ON-time without dyskinesia (3.37 hou rs vs 1.09 hours, res pectively; treatment d ifference: 2.28 hours; p = 0.0142). Significant improvements in the UPDRS II (ab ility to engage in activities o f daily living) score and heal th-related quality of life (HRQoL), as measured by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire ( PDQ-39), were also report ed in patients receiving Duopa vs IR carbidopa/levodopa (Olanow et al 2014). In a 52-week, open-label extension study, all patients received Duopa (N = 62). Those continuing Duopa maintained their improved OFF-time; however , this value was not statistica lly significant compared to the mean OFF-time at the start of the extension study (mean change in hours/day: -0.42; p = 0.377). Duopa-na\u00efve patients showed a statistically significant improvement in OFF- time from the start of the exten sion study (mean change in hours/day: 2.34; p significan t improvements in ON-time witho ut troublesome dyskinesia from the start of the extension study were demonstrated in both Duopa-na\u00efve (mean cha nge in hours/day: 2.19; p = 0.005) and Duopa- continuing patients (mean change in hours/day: 1.00; p = 0.036, respectively). In regard to HRQoL, both the Duopa- continuing and Duopa-na\u00efve groups demonstrated statistically si gnificant improvements in the overall UPDRS Part IV score, a measure of motor complications associated with PD (Slevin et al 2015). In a 54-week open-label study, a ll patients received Duopa (N = 354). OFF-time was signif icantly decreased from baseline to last visit by 4.4 hour s/day (p < 0.001 ). This impro vement was sustained throug hout all visits from weeks 4 to 54. Similarly, ON-time withou t troublesome dyskinesia increa sed by 4.8 hours/day (p < 0.001), and ON-time with troublesome dyskinesia decreased by 0.4 hours/day (p = 0.023). These improvements were s ustained at all visits.

UPDRS Part IV dyskinesia items , and HRQoL were o bserved at the study end compared with baseline (Fernandez et al 2015). Inbrija The efficacy and safety of I nbrija for the treatment of OFF episodes in patients with PD treated with oral carbidopa/levodopa were evaluat ed in a 12-week, DB, PC, RCT. Pa tients with at least 2 hours of OFF time per day were randomized to receive Inbrija i nhalation powder 60 mg (n = 113) , 84 mg (n = 114), or placebo (n = 112) as needed for OFF episodes. The average use of Inbrija or placebo was approxi mately 2 doses per day . Change in UPDRS Part III (motor) score from pre-dose (O FF state) to 30 minutes post-dose was significantly greater in the Inbrija 84 mg group vs placebo at week 12 (least squares mean change in Inbrija group: -9.83 p = 0.0088). The proportion of pa tients who returned to an ON state and sustained the ON state through 60 minutes post-dose was 58% for Inbrija 84 mg an d 36% for placebo (p = 0.003) (LeWitt et al 2019). The effect of Inbrija on pulmonary function was evaluated in PD patients treated with oral carbidopa/levodopa in a 12- month, open-label, RCT. Patients were randomized to receive Inb rija 84 mg (n = 278) or to an observational cohort receiving oral standard of care therapy (n = 130). There was no significant difference in pulmonary function as assessed by spirometry parameters between the Inbrija and observational cohort groups at 52 weeks. Exploratory endpoints in the Inbrija group included improvements in UPDRS Part III scores, a s well as patient-reported me asures such as daily OFF time (Grosset et al 2018a [poster], Grosset et al 2018 b [poster], Inbrija prescribing 2018). Rytary The efficacy and safety of Ryta ry were evaluated in 3 DB, RCTs; 2 trials were conducted in advanced PD patients vs carbidopa/levodopa IR and carbidopa/levodopa + entacapone, and 1 trial was conducted in early PD patients vs placebo. In comparison to IR carbidopa/le vodopa (n = 192), Rytary (n = 201) demonstrated a stat istically significant improvement in the percentage of O FF-time in advanced PD patien ts, from a baseline of 36.9% to 23.8% for the Rytary group and from a baseline of 36.0% to 29.8% for the IR c arbidopa/levodopa group (p < 0.0001). This translated to the Rytary group ex periencing an additional reduc tion of 1 hour in OFF-time compared to the IR carbidopa/levodopa group (p < 0.0001) (Hauser et al 2013) . In a crossover study of advanced PD patients, all rece ived either Rytary or carbi dopa/levodopa + entacapone 91). Rytary demonstrated a statistically significant impro vement in the percentage of OFF-time, from a baseline of 36.3% (both Rytary and carbidopa/levodopa + entacapone patie nts) vs 32.5% i n the carbidopa/levodopa + entacapone group (p < 0.0001). Hence, compared with carbidopa /levodopa + entacapon e treatment, Rytary reduced OFF-time by 1.4 hours (Stocchi et al 2014) . The PC study randomized 381 levodopa-na\u00efve patients to 3 streng ths of Rytary (145 mg, 245 mg, or 390 mg) given 3 times daily or placebo. All dos ages demonstrated a statisticall y significant improvemen t in UPDRS measures vs placebo throughout the study and a t 30 weeks (p < 0.0001). Ryta ry was well tolerated, with the most commonly reported AEs being nausea, dizzi ness, and headache; the authors concluded that Rytary 145 mg 3 times daily appeared to provide the best ove rall balance between efficacy a nd safety (Pahwa et al 2014) . CLINICAL GUIDELINES The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameter on i nitiation of treatment for PD recommends that in patients who require the initiation of dopaminergic treatment, levodopa or a DA may be used ; the choice d epends on the relative impact of improving motor disability (better with levo dopa) compared with the lessening of motor complications (better with DAs). Either an IR o r an ER product may be conside red, as there appears to be no difference in the rate of motor complications (Miyasaki et al 2002) . The AAN practice parameter on tr eatment of PD motor fluctu and rasagiline to reduce OFF-time (Pahwa et al 2006). The International Parkinson and Mo vement Disorder Society provi des recommendations for treatment of motor symptoms of PD. For monotherapy in early PD, DAs, oral levodopa preparations, selegiline, and rasagiline are clinically useful. For treating motor fluct uations, clinically useful options include most DAs, lev odopa ER, levodopa intestinal infusion, entacapone, rasagiline , safinamide, and deep brain st imulation, which is more invasive (Fox et al 2018). The European Federation of Neurol ogical Societies (EFNS) and Mo vement Disorders Soc iety (MDS) provide recommendations for motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in late PD. For motor fluctuatio ns, the levodopa dose may be adjusted to attenuate any \"wearing- off\" syndromes. Dyskinesias may be managed by reducing the individual levodopa dose at the risk of increasing OFF-time. Increased OFF-time can be attenuated by increasing the number of daily doses of levodopa or increasing the dose of a DA (eg, apomorphine, br omocriptine, pramipexole, ropinirole).

SAFETY SUMMARY Contraindications All levodopa products are contraindicated in patients currently taking a nonselective MAO inhi bitor or who have recently (within 2 weeks) taken a nonselec tive MAO inhibitor. Hypertensi on can occur if these drug s are used concurrently. Warnings and Precautions Warnings and precautions for a ll of the levodopa products inclu de falling asleep during activities of daily living, hallucinations/exacerbations of p sychosis, impulse control diso rders, causation or exacer bation of dyskinesia, and increased intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. Sudden discontinuation or rapid do se reduction should be avoide d to reduce the risk of withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion rese mbling neuroleptic malignant syn Cardiovascular ischemic events and arrhythmia have been reporte d in patients taking carbidopa/levodopa. Patients should be observed car efully for the development of de pression with concomitan t suicidal tendencies. Duopa has warnings and gastrointestinal or gastr risks. Inbrija has a warning for broncho spasm in patients with lung di sease; use in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or ot her chronic underlying lung dise ase is not recommended. Due to the entacapone component, Stalevo has addition warnings for diarrhea, colitis, and rhabdomyolysis. Epidemiological studie s have shown that pat ients with PD have a higher risk of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the in creased risk obser ved is due to PD or other factors, such as d rugs used to treat PD, is unclear. Key Adverse Effects The most common AEs for the carb idopa/levodopa oral formulations include dyskinesias an d nausea. Orthostatic hypotension, confusion, dizzine ss, and hallucinations also occu r. The most common AEs for Duopa (i ncidence at least 7% greater than oral carbidopa/levodopa) are complication of device insertion, nausea, depression, peripheral edema, hyperte nsion, upper respiratory tract infection, oropharyngeal pain, atelectasis, and inc ision site erythema. The most common AEs for Inbrija are cough, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, a nd discolored sputum. The most common AEs for Stalevo are dyskinesias, urine discolor ation, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and dry mouth. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION General dosing information The optimum daily dosage of the le vodopa combination products m ust be determined by careful ti tration in each patient. Because PD is progressive, peri odic clinical evaluations are re commended; adjustment o f the carbidopa/levodopa dosage regimen ma y be required. Other antiparkinson medications eg, anticholinergic agents, do pamine adine) can be given with the carbidopa/levodopa products. Dos age adjustment of carbidopa/levodopa may be necessary when these agents are added. Studies show that peripheral dopa decarboxylase is saturated by carbidopa at approximat ely 70 to 100 mg a day. Patients receiving less than this amount of carbidopa are more likely to experience nausea and vomiting. Experience with total daily dosages of carbidopa greater than 200 mg is li mited. 71 Data as of January 16, 2019 CME/KAL Page 6 of 8 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

It is gene rally the first choice for treatment if symptoms, especially bradykinesia, become troubles ome. Levodopa is combine d with the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor carbidop a to block its conversion to do pamine in the systemic circulation and liver prior to crossing the blood-brain barrier . This prevents (Tarsy 2018a, Tarsy 2018b). effective in the treatment of PD symptoms, levodopa-induced complications develop within several years of starting levodopa in a substantial number of patients; complications include motor fluctuations (\"wearing off\" phenomenon), and dyst onia. Treatment strategies for levodopa-induced dyskinesia include adjusting the levodopa dose and dosing schedule or adding an ad ditional antiparkinson medication. Carbidopa/levodopa combination products are available as IR tablets, ER tablets and capsules, and ODTs. Stalevo tablets includ e entacapone, a and po tentiate patients who experience \"wearing off\". Duopa, an enteral carbidopa/levodopa suspension, is given as a continuous PEG -J infusion for patients with motor fluctuations in advanced PD . Inbrija is a levodopa inhalation powder intended to be used as an adjunct to carbidopa/levodopa therapy for t he intermittent treatment of OF F episodes. The optimum daily dosage of the le vodopa combination products m ust be determined by careful ti tration in each patient. Warnings and precautions for a ll of the levodopa products inclu de falling asleep during activities of daily living, hallucinations/exacerbations of p sychosis, impulse control diso rders, and causation or exa cerbation of dyskinesia. warnings for gastrointestinal risk and neu ropathy. Inbrija has a warning for bronchospasm in patients with lung disease. Due to the entacapone component, St alevo has additional warnings for diarrhea, colitis, and rhabdomyolysis. Common AEs for the levodopa products include dy skinesias and nausea. Guidelines for the treatment of PD recommend initiation of eith er a DA or carbidopa/levodopa product; either an IR or an ER product may be considered, a s there appears to be no differe nce in the rate of motor complications. In late PD, motor fluctuations or dyskines ias can be managed by modifying t he levodopa dose/schedule or adding an additional antiparkinson medicati on such as entacapone (Fox et al 2018, Miyasaki et al 2002, Oertel et al 2011, Pahwa et al 2006).

Therapeutic Class Overview Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) INTRODUCTION Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory d rugs (NSAIDs) are a large class of medications with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic properties used fo r a wide variety of conditions i ncluding pain, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), primary dysmenorrhea, spondylitis (AS), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), acute migraine, and acute gout (Conaghan 2012). RA is an autoimmune inflammatory arthritis that can be treated with conventional or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or intraarticular (IA) corticosteroids, and/or oral or topical analgesics including NS AIDs (Singh et al 2015). OA is the most common form of a rthritis, and is a degenerative inflammatory disease that c an be treated with oral or topical analgesics including N SAIDs, IA corticosteroid or hyalu ronate injections, (duloxetine), and therapy (Hochberg et al 2012, Loeser 2018). Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain in the absence of other pelvic pathology, and repr esents one of the most common causes of pelvic pain. It can be treated with oral NSAID s, hormonal contraceptives, topical heat, and exercise (Osayande et al 2013). AS is a chronic inflammatory arthr itis characterized by sacro-i liac joint involvement tha t can be treated with oral or topical NSAIDs, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, slow acting a ntirheumatic drugs including Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine), locally adm inistered parenteral glucocorticoids, physical therapy, or surgery (Ward et al 2016). JIA is a chronic idiopathic infl ammatory disorder that affects pediatric patients. JIA encom passes multiple forms of arthritis in childhood, including what was previously described as juvenile rheumatoid arth ritis before being supplanted by the newer term. Treatment for JIA includes co nventional or b iologic et al 2013). Migraine is a disorder associated with severe headaches worsened by activity, light, and/or sounds, and can be treated with oral analgesics including NSAIDs and opioids, ergot derivative medications, tr iptans, antiemetics, and antiepileptics (Marmura et al 2015). Gout is the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis in adults, and typically presents ac utely as synovitis due to tissue deposition of monosodium u rate crystals. Acute gout can be treated with Colcrys (colchicine), systemic corticosteroids, and/or NSAIDs (Khanna et al 2012). Some NSAIDs including ibuprofen and naproxen are available at l ower strengths as over-the-counter (OTC) formulations, which do not require a prescription. The same com pounds are also available in higher strengths as a prescription-only product. Other NSAIDs are available only by p rescription regardl ess of strength. Both prescription-strength and OTC NSAIDs are widely utilized, accounting for over 111 milli on prescriptions annually and 60% of the OTC analgesic market i n the United States (U.S.). The use of NSAIDs has been increasing over time and utilization is highest in i ndividuals over 60 years of age (Conaghan 2012, Davis et al 2017). The therapeutic effects of NSAIDs are primarily attributed to i nhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which participate in the formation of mediators associated with infla mmation and pain. Most NSAIDs block both related isoforms the COX enzyme: COX-1 and COX-2 (Solomon 2017). COX-1 regulates homeostasis, platelet aggregation, and kidney function. Inhibition of COX-1 is theorized to contribute to some adverse events associated with NSAID use (Solomon 2017). COX-2 is usually undet ectable in most tissue s, but its expression is increased during states of inflammation (Solomon 2017). In 2005, the Food and Drug Adminis tration (FDA) began requiring all prescription NSAIDs to carry a boxed warning highlighting the potential for in creased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. OTC NSAIDs were also required to have labeling providing more specific information about these risks (FDA Drug Safety Communication). In 2015, following an advisory co mmittee review of additional e vidence, the FDA required revisions to existing warnings for both prescription and OTC NSAIDs to strengthen mes saging regarding potential risks of use. Statements were included regarding the risk potentially increasing with du ration of use (FDA Drug Safety Communication). 76 Data as of June 2018 CC/AS Page 2 of 10 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Most NSAIDs on the market hav e been generic for some time. In f act, many of the originator brand products have been discontinued, leaving only generic versions on the market.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Generally, the NSAID cl ass has well-established efficacy as ana lgesic and anti-inflammatory medications. In addition to placebo-controlled pivotal trials for individual agents, several systematic reviews and meta -analyses have shown that NSAIDs compare favorably to placebo for pain reduction for vari ous conditions. Most have al so concluded that there is insufficient evidence that any one NSAID is more effective than any other (Derry et al 2012, Enthoven et al 2016, Kroon et al 2015, Marjoribanks et al 2015, Wang et al 2016). A Cochrane review of NSAIDs for treatment of chronic low back pain evaluated 13 trials ( N = 1354), and concluded that there is evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than plac ebo at reducing pain and disability. No difference in efficacy was seen between individual NSAIDs (Enthoven et al 2016). A systematic review (N = 68 tria ls) of NSAID use in various typ es of chronic pain including OA, RA, soft-tissue pain, back pain, and AS found that there are no significant differences in pain relief between non selective NSAIDs, partially selective NSAIDs (defined in the trial as meloxicam, , and etodolac), and celecoxib. Comparisons between nonselective NSAIDs also found no clear differences in efficacy (Peterson et al 2010). In a comparative effectiveness review, the Agency for Healthcar e Research and Quality (AHRQ) assessed the efficacy of selective and non-selective NSAIDs, aspirin, acetaminophen, and topical NSAIDs and rubefacients for long-term improvements in OA symptoms. The review found that go od evidence exists that nonselective and partially 79 Data as of June 2018 CC/AS Page 5 of 10 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. selective NSAIDs do not differ significantly in efficacy for pa in relief or symptom improv ement as compared to each other or to COX-2 selective NSAI Ds. However, the review concluded that no evidence exists comparing the efficacy of aspirin to NSAIDs fo r treatment of pain. O ral NSAIDs were fo und to have similar effica cy to topical NSAIDs for OA of the knee (Chou et al 2006). A Cochrane review including 80 tr ials (N = 5820) concluded that NSAIDs are a very effect ive treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. Insufficient evidenc e was found to determine if a ny individual NSAID is more effective than another NSAID, including comparisons bet ween COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs (Marjoribanks et al 2015). A network meta-analysis of 26 tr ials (N = 3410) for treatment o f pain due to AS found that th ere were no significant differences in efficacy between NSAIDs. Etoricoxib (an NSAID no t available in the U.S.) was found to be superior to celecoxib, ketoprofen, and tenoxicam (also not available in the U.S.). No other significant differences between NSAIDs were found. All 20 evaluated NSAIDs reduced pain as compared to placebo (Wang et al 2016). A systematic review of 39 studies (N = 4356 ) evaluating the use of NSAIDs for axial spondyl oarthritis determined that there is high to moderate qualit y evidence that NSAIDs are effi cacious for treatment of axial spondyloarthritis. NSAIDs were more beneficial than plac ebo and there was no difference i n efficacy between the va rious evaluated NSAIDs, including COX-2 selective agents (Kroon et al 2015). A Cochrane review of NSAIDs for treatment of acute gout includi ng 23 trials (N = 2200) determined that while data is insufficient to draw firm conclusions, they do not conflict wit h guideline recommendations for the use of NSAIDs as first-line treatment. Additionally, moderate-quality evidence was found to support the claim that COX-2 selective NSAIDs and nonselective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial (van Durme et al 2014). Comparative reviews have also b een conducted eval uating the eff icacy of oral NSAIDs as compared to topical NSAIDs and other non-NSAID agents for the treatment of various types o f pain. A Cochrane review of 34 studies ( N = 7688) evaluated oral NSAID s and topical diclofenac for treatment of OA pain. The review found that while both were significantly more effect ive than placebo, there appea red to be no difference in efficacy between the two treatm ent modalities for knee or hand OA (Derry et al 2012). A network meta-analysis of 137 studies (N = 33,243) comparing a cetaminophen, oral NSAIDs , and IA injections of corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid concluded that IA treatments were clinically superior to oral NSAIDs after 3 months of treatment. Oral NSAIDs were in turn clinically superior to a cetaminophen for treatment of OA pain after the same duration of treatment (Bannuru et al 2015). For treatment of OA, AHRQ has stated that there is good evidence that acetaminophen is modestly inferior in efficacy compared to NSAIDs, although with a lower risk of GI complicati ons (Chou et al 2006). A network meta-analysis found tha t select NSAIDs (celecoxib, diclofenac, naproxen, and piro xicam) and opioids are similarly effective in reduction of pain for the treatment of k nee OA (Smith et al 2016). A network meta-analysis comparing ibuprofen, diclofenac potassi um, aspirin, and multiple triptans (including a combination of naproxen and suma triptan) for treatment of migraine found that ibuprofen and aspirin were inferior to eletriptan and rizatriptan with respect to pain relief, but that diclofenac potassium was mor e effective than any other intervention for pain relief at 2 hours. However, diclofenac di d have the largest rate of mig raine recurrence requiring rescue therapy. Addition of naprox en to sumatriptan significant ly reduced the rate of migraine recurrence as compared to sumatriptan alone. Overall tolerability was similar between the NSAIDs, which a s a class was superior to that of the triptans (Xu et al 2016). A Cochrane review concluded that for primary dysmenorrhea, the NSAID class appears to be more effective than acetaminophen. However, this analysis was based on only 3 trial s that compared NSAIDs with acetaminophen, and the quality of evidence was low (Marjoribanks et al 2015). Studies were conducted evaluating the efficacy of Tivorbex (ind omethacin), Vivlodex (mel oxicam), and Zorvolex (diclofenac) as compared to pla cebo. All 3 products were found to be superior to placebo fo r the treatment of pain in individual randomized controlled trials. Studies were not condu cted comparing efficacy or safety of these products vs existing higher-dose generic form ulations of indomethacin, melo exposure of Tivorbex, Vivlodex, and Zorvolex has not been shown to be equivalent to o ther formulations of oral indomethacin, meloxicam, and diclofenac, respectively. Several large systematic revie ws and meta-analyses have analyze d the risk of adverse events with use of NSAIDs, including comparisons between t he nonselective NS AIDs and between nonselective and COX- 2 selective NSAIDs. A large meta-analysis of 280 tria ls (N = 124,513) evaluating th e CV and GI risk of various NSAIDs concluded that the vascular risk of high-dose diclo fenac (150 mg daily or greater) and possibly ibuprofen ar e comparable to that of COX- 2 selective NSAIDs. B y contrast, high-dose naproxen (100 mg daily or greater) is associate d with less vascular risk than other NSAIDs. All NSAIDs inc reased risk of upper GI compli cations by a factor of 2 to 4, although the lowest 80 Data as of June 2018 CC/AS Page 6 of 10 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

None of the eva luated NSAIDs were found to increase risk of stroke (Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' [CNT] Collaboration 2013). A Bayesian meta-analysis of MI ris k with NSAID use in a cohort of 446,763 individuals found that all NSAIDs, including naproxen and celecoxib, were associated with an increased risk of acute MI. Risk was greatest with use of higher doses as well as during the first month of NSAID use. Risk did not appear to increa se beyond the first 30 days of use (Bally et al 2017). A comparative effectiveness rev iew found that all NSAIDs can ca use or aggravate hypertension, congestive heart failure, edema, and impaired renal function. Although no clear differences were seen between selective or nonselective NSAIDs in incidence of these adverse events, weak evidence was noted for a lo wer hypertensive effect with aspirin and sulindac than other NSAIDs. Overall tolerability was similar between the NSAIDs. Aspirin wa s less well tolerated than the oral NSAIDs (Chou et al 2006). CLINICAL GUIDELINES OA: The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) conditionally recom mends the use of oral N SAIDs as a class for the treatment of hand, hip, and knee OA . Within the NSAID class, no specific agents were identif ied as being more or less effective or safe as compared to other members of the class. Additional pharmacologic recommendations included acetaminophen, topical NSAIDs, and tramadol (Hochberg et al 2012). A conditional recommendation was defined as one based on absenc e of high-quality evidence and/or evidence of only a small gradient of differenc e between desirable and undes irable effects of treatment. For patients 75 years of age, an additional conditional recommendation was made for the use of topical rather than oral NSAIDs for treatment of hand OA. For patient s < 75 years o ld, the technical expert panel expressed no preference for topical rather than oral NSAIDs. Primary dysmenorrhea: Based upon a Cochrane review o f 73 randomized controlled trial s, the American Academy of Family Physician recommends oral NSAIDs as first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhea . Specifically, guidelines support the use of celecoxib, i buprofen, mefenamic acid, and na proxen. Choice of NSAID shou ld be based on individual patient characteristics as no N SAID has been shown to be more e ffective than any other (Osayande et al 2014). Treatment initiation is recomm ended 1 to 2 days before expected onset of menses, with trea tment duration of 2 to 3 days. AS: A joint guideline by the ACR, S pondylitis Association of Ameri ca, and the Spondyloarthriti s Research and Treatment Network strongly recommends treat ment of active AS with oral NS AIDs. Additionally, a conditional recommendation was provided for continuous treatmen t with NSAIDs over on-demand tr eatment. As no formal comparative effectiveness studies of NSAIDs were available, the guideline recommended aga inst designating any particular NSAID as the preferred treatment option. In stead, choice of NSAID should be determined by each patient's history, risk factors, and comorbidities (Ward et al 2016). JIA: ACR recommendations for JIA include initiation of NSAID monoth erapy in patients with out prior treatment for a maximum of 1 month. The guideline specifically states that cont inuation of NSAID monotherapy for longer than 2 months in patients with continued diseas e activity is inappropriate. Both recommendations wer e based on expert opinion (Ringold et al 2013). Acute migraine: The American Headache Society guidelines for acute treatment of migraine include various degrees of recommendations for use of oral NSAIDs depending on the specifi c agent. Aspirin, diclofena c, ibuprofen, and naproxen are recommended as having estab lished efficacy. Additional NSAI Ds including flurbiprofen and ketoprofen are recommended as probably effectiv e, while celecoxib was deemed t o have conflicting or inadequate evidence to support or refute use ( Marmura et al 2015). Gout: Oral NSAIDs are recommended by t he ACR as an appropriate first- line treatment option fo r acute gout, either as monotherapy or in combination with systemic corticosteroids and/or oral colchicine. Howev er, the task force did not recommend any specific NSAID over the others (Khanna et al 2012). The ACR also supports use of low-d ose NSAID therapy as an appropriate first-line method of prophylaxis for acute gout attacks. No consensus was reached on the us e of intramuscular ketorolac or topical NSAIDs for the treatment of acute gout. 81 Data as of June 2018 CC/AS Page 7 of 10 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

SAFETY SUMMARY Boxed warnings: All oral NSAID products with the exception of Durlaza (aspirin ER) share the 2 boxed warn ings below for CV and GI risk: Serious CV thrombotic events: NSAI Ds cause an increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events, including MI and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatm ent and may increase with duration of use. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setti ng of coronary artery bypass gr aft (CABG) surgery. Serious GI bleeding, ulcerations and perforation: NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious GI adverse events including bleeding, ulceration , and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bl eeding are at greater risk for serious GI events. Ketorolac carries additional boxed warnings for the following: Renal risk: Ketorolac is contrai ndicated in patients with advan ced renal function impairmen t and in patients at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion. Risk of bleeding: Ketorolac inhibits platelet function and is, therefore, contraindicated in patients with suspected or confirmed cerebrovascular bleedi ng, hemorrhagic diathesis, or i ncomplete hemostasis, and in those at high risk of bleeding. Ketorolac is contraindi cated as a prophylactic analge sic before any major surgery. Risk during labor and delivery : The use of ketorolac tromethami ne in labor and delivery is contraindicated because it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine c ontractions. Concomitant use with NSAIDs: Ketor olac is tients currently receivi ng aspirin or NSAIDs because of the cumulative risks o f inducing serious NSAID-related side effects. Special populations: Dosage shou ld be adjusted for patients 65 years or older, for patients under 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight, and for patients with moderately elevated serum cr eatinine. Contraindications: Most oral NSAID products share a contraindication for use in th e setting of CABG surgery, as well as in patients with a history of asthma, urticaria , or allergic-type reactions afte r taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Additional contraindications specific to i ndividual compounds are listed b elow. Fenoprofen (Profeno only): History of significantly impaired renal function Ketorolac: Active or history of peptic ulc er disease; recent or history of GI bleeding or perforation Prophylactic analgesic bef ore any major surgery Advanced renal impairment or pat ients at risk for renal failure because of volume depletion Labor and delivery Suspected or confirmed cerebrovascular bleeding, hemorrhagic diathesis, incomplete hemostasis and those at high risk of bleeding Patients currently receiving aspirin or NSAIDs Concomitant use with probenecid or pentoxifylline. Warnings and precautions: Most oral NSAID products share similar warnings and precautions for: Increased risk of CV thrombotic events New onset or worsening of hypertension Increased risk of hospitalizat ion due to heart failure and incr eased edema Risk of GI effects including ulceration, bleeding, and perforat ion Risk of renal injury and toxicity Potential for skin reactions i ncluding Stevens-J ohnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis Risk of premature clo sure of the ductus arteriosus when used in late pregnancy Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests Potential for anemia Risk of severe bronchospasm in patients with preexisting aspirin-sensitive asthma Risk of Reye's syndrome 82 Data as of June 2018 CC/AS Page 8 of 10 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Ketorolac: The total combined duration of u se of ketorolac tromethamine ta blets and IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days in adults. Ketorolac trome thamine tablets are no t indicated for use in pediatric patients. Adverse events: Adverse events were similar among products and commonly include d GI complaints (abdomin al pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, g ross bleeding/perforation, he artburn, nausea, gastric/duodenal GI ulcers, and vomiting), abnormal renal function, anemia, dizziness, edema, elevated liver enzymes, headaches, increased bleeding time, pruritus, rashes, and tinnitus.

CONCLUSION Oral NSAIDs are efficacious for t he treatment of pain, RA, OA, primary dysmenorrhea, AS, a cute migraine, and acute gout. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analy ses have shown that NSAIDs are superio r to placebo for these indications. Furthermore, practice guidelines for these conditi ons recommend NSAIDs as a fi rst-line treatment option. The totality of currently avail able evidence on relative efficacy between the available NSAIDs suggests that in general, there does not appear to be a signi ficant difference in efficac y among the NSAIDs. Clinical p ractice guidelines for the aforementioned conditi ons support this finding and either recommend the use of NSAIDs as a class or recommend a list of NSAIDs for potential use wit hout specifying a preference between listed agents. All NSAIDs carry some degree o f risk for adverse events includi ng CV thrombotic events and GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation. Avail able evidence for the relative risk of th ese adverse events amongst NSAIDs is conflicting and inconclusive at this time. All reviewed NSAIDs with the exception of Durlaza (aspirin ER) ca rry the same boxed warnings for CV and GI risk. Contraindica tions, warnings/precautions, an d adverse effects are similar among products. Differences between oral NSAIDs include FDA-labeled indications , available dosage formulations and strengths, dosing frequency.

Therapeutic Class Overview Multiple Sclerosis Agents INTRODUCTION Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chr onic, immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system ( CNS), is the leading cause of disability in young and middle- aged people in developed area s of the world (MS Coalition 2018) . MS is characterized by repeated episodes of inflammation within the brain and spina l cord, resulting in injury to the myelin sheaths that surround and insulate nerves, and subsequently the nerve cell a xons (Goodin et al 2002) . There are 4 of MS: o Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), whi ch is characterized by acute attacks followed by partial or full recovery. This is the most common form of MS, acco unting for 80 to 85% of cases. o Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) begins as RRMS; however, the at tack rate declines over time. Patients experience a gradual deteriorati on. Patients with RRMS for more than 10 years may transition to SPMS. o Primary progressive MS (PPMS) o ccurs in approximately 10% of pa tients with MS. Patient s have a continuous and gradual decline in function without evidence of acute attacks. o Clinically isolated syndrome (CI S) refers to the first episode of neurologic symptoms that l asts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation or demyelination in the CNS (Goodin et al 2002, Sanvito et al 2011, National MS Society 2019[a]) . A more recent revision of the MS clinical course descriptions r ecommended that the core MS phenotype descriptions of relapsing and progressive disease be retained with some of the following modifications: (1) an important modifier of these core phenotypes is an assessment of disease activity, as defined by clinical assessment of relapse occurrence or lesion activity detec ted by CNS imaging; 2) the second importa nt modifier of these phenoty pes is a determination of whether progression of disability has occurred ov er a given tim e period; and (3) the prior category of PRMS can be eliminated since subjects so cate gorized would now be classifie d as PPMS patients with disease activity (Lublin et al 2014) . An estimated 1 million adults in the United States have been di agnosed with MS. Most pati ents are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and MS is reported more frequently in women than in men (National MS Society 2019[b]) . Diagnosis of MS requires evi dence of damage in at least 2 separate areas of the CNS, evidence of damage that occurred at 2 separate time poi nts at least 1 month apart, and that other possible diagnos es have been ruled out. The clinically isolated syndrome (CIS ) includes 1 attack and objective evidence of 1 lesion (Thompson et al 2018) . Following CIS, the course of MS is variabl e. The inclusion of CIS in the spectrum of MS phenotypes wit h prospective follow-up of most such patients determining their subsequent disease phenotype was also recommended in the recent revision of the MS clinical course descriptions (Lublin et al 2014) . Disease-modifying therapies (DM Ts) delay the development from C IS to clinically definite MS (CDMS) (Miller et al 2012, Armoiry et al 2018) . Evaluation includes an extensive patient history, neurological examination, laboratory tests to rule out other possible causes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for new disease an d signs of more chronic damage, and possibly lumbar puncture ( Thompson et al 2018 ). Exacerbations, also known as flar es, relapses, or attacks of MS are caused by inflammation in the CNS that leads to damage to the myelin and slows or blocks transmission of nerve impulses. An exacerbation must last at least 24 hours and be separated from a previou s exacerbation by at least 30 da ys. Exacerbations can be mild or severe. Intravenous (IV) corticosteroids may be used to treat severe exacerbations of MS. Corticosteroids decrease acute inflammation in the CNS but do not provide any long-term benefits (Frohman et al 2007) . The approach to treating MS includes the management of symptoms, treatment of acute relap ses and utiliz ation of DMTs to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, reduce l esions on MRI scans, and possibly delay disease and disability progression (Rae-Grant et al 2018[b]) . The American Academy of Neurol ogy (AAN), the European Committ ee for Research and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and the European Academy of Neu rology (EAN) recently updated their guidelines on MS. Both guidelines recommend initiation of DMTs treatment early on in the patient's disease course ( Rae Grant et al 2018[b], Montalban et al 2018 ). The MS Coalition, the AAN , and the Association of British Neurologists guidelines s upport access to the available DMTs for patients with MS .

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY In the management of MS, numerous clinical trials have establis hed the safety and efficacy of the biologic response modifiers in reducing the frequenc y of relapses lesions on MRI scans, and possibly delayi ng disease progression and disability. Interferons and glatiramer acetate Pivotal clinical tria ls demonstrating effi cacy in reducing the rate of relapses, burden of disease on MRI, and disability progression for the interferons and glatiramer acetate were pub lished in the 1990's (Jacobs et al 1996, Johnson et al, 88 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 4 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Long-term follow-up data for IFN -1b show that overall surviva l in MS is improved (Goodin et al 2012) . Head-to-head trials have found (IFN-1a SC), and Betaseron (IFN-1b) to be comparable in terms of relapse rate reduction and disease and disability progression (PRISMS 1998, Kappos et al 2006, Mikol et al 2008, Flechter et al 2002, Cadavid et al 2009, O'Connor et al 2009) . The results of several studies suggest that lower dose Avonex (IFN-1a 30 mcg intramus cular [IM] once weekly) may be less efficacious while being more tolerable compared to higher do se Rebif (IFN-1a subcutaneous [ SC] 3 times weekly or every other day) or glatiramer acetate (Khan et al 2001[a], Khan et al 2001[b], Barbero et al 2006, Durelli et al 2002, Panitch et al 2002, Panitch et al 2005, Schwid et al 2005, Schwid et al 2007, Traboulsee et al 2008) . In a meta-analysis of 5 randomiz ed studies comparing IFNs with glatiramer acetate, there were no significant differences between IFNs and glatiramer aceta te in terms of the number of p atients with relapses, c onfirmed progression, or discontinuation due to adverse events at 24 months (La Mantia et al 2016) . o At 36 months, however, evidence fr om a single study suggested t hat relapse rates were higher in the group given IFNs than in the glatiramer ace tate group (risk ratio [RR] 1.40 , 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1 .13 to 1.74; p = 0.002). While MRI outcomes analysis showed that effects on newer enlarg ing T2 or new contrast-enhancing T1 lesions at 24 months were similar, the reducti on in T2- and T1-weighted lesio n volume was significantly g reater in the groups given IFNs than in the glatiramer ace tate groups (mean difference [MD ] 0.58, 95% CI: 0.99 to 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.07; p = 0.003, respectively). In a network meta-analysis of 24 studies comparing IFNs and gla tiramer acetate, both dr ugs were found to reduce the annualized relapse rate (ARR) as compared to placebo but did no t differ statistically from each other ( Melendez-Torres et al 2018 ). Ranking of the drugs based on SUCRA (surface under the cumulative ranking curv e) indicated that glatiramer acetate 20 mg once daily had t he highest probability for superiority, followed by peginterferon -1a 125 mcg every 2 weeks. A meta-analysis of 6 placebo-c ontrolled trials failed to find a significant advantage of Av onex (IFN-1a) 30 mcg IM once weekly compared to placebo in the number of relapse-free patien ts after 1 year of therapy ( Freedman et al 2008 ). In contrast, other studi es found Avonex (IFN-1a) 30 mcg IM once weekly to be comparable to t he other IFN products in terms of relapse rate reducti on, disability progression, and SPMS development (Carra et al 2008, Limmroth et al 2007, Minagara et al 2008, Rio et al 2005, Tr ojano et al 2003, Trojano et al 2007) . Moreover, IFN therapy, especially the higher dose products, is associated with the production of neutralizin g antibodies (NAb), which may result in decreased radiographic and clinical effectiveness of treatment (Goodin et al 2007, Sorensen et al 2005) . Exploratory post-hoc analyses of the PRISMS trial linked the development of NAb with reduced efficacy (Alsop et al 2005) . Development of NAb among patients (N = 368) rand omized to receive Rebif (IFN- 1a) 44 or 22 mcg SC 3 time s weekly for 4 years was associated with higher relapse r ates (adjusted relapse rate rat io, 1.41; 95% CI: 1.12 to 1. 78; p = 0.004), a greater number of active lesions, and percentage change in T2 lesion bu rden from baseline on MRI s can (p < 0.001). In a systematic review of 40 studie s of MS agents including IFN-1a and IFN-1b, the primary outcome measure was the frequency of IFN NAb (Govindappa et al 2015) . NAb development was most frequent with IFN -1b, followed by IFN - 1a SC, and lowest with IFN -1a IM. Higher doses were associate d with a higher rate of NAb development. The CombiRx trial evaluated the combination of Copaxone (glatir amer acetate) and Avonex (IF N-1a IM) over 3 years. The ARR for the combination therapy (IFN-1a + gl atiramer) was not statistically superior to the better of the 2 single treatment arms (glatiramer) (p = 0.27). The ARRs were 0.12 for the combination therapy, 0. 16 for IFN-1a, and 0.11 for glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer ac etate performed significantly better than IFN-1a, reducing th e risk of exacerbation by 31% (p = 0.027), and IFN-1a + gl atiramer acetate performed significantly better than IFN -1a, reducing the risk of exacerbation by 25% ( p = 0.022). The 3 treatment groups did not show a significant differenc e in disability progression over 6 months. Combination therapy was superior to either monot herapy in reducing new lesion activity and accumulation of total lesion volume (Lublin et al 2013) . It is estimated that within a fe w years of initiating treatment , at least 30 and 15% of patients discontinue MS biological response modifiers d ue to perceived lack of efficacy or side ef fects, respectively (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . According to several observational studies, switching patients who have failed to adequately respond to initial treatment to another first-line therapy is safe and effective (Caon et al 2006, Zwibel 2006, Carra et al 2008) . Patients switching to glatiramer acetate after experiencing inadequate response to IFN-1a therapy experienced a reduction in relapse rates and disability progression. Likew ise, switching to IFN-1a ther apy after suboptimal efficacy with glatiramer acetate increased the number of relaps e-free patients in 1 study (Carra et al 2008) . The smallest reducti on in the ARR was seen in patients who had switched from one IFN-1a preparation to an other. 89 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 5 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The GALA study evaluated glatiramer acetate SC 40 mg 3 times weekly compared to plac ebo in 1404 patients with relapsing MS over 12 months. Resul ts demonstrated that glatiram er acetate 40 mg 3 times weekly, compared to placebo, reduced the ARR and MRI endpoints (Khan et al 2013) . Glatiramer acetate 20 mg daily and 40 mg 3 times weekly have not been directly compared for efficacy. A Phase 3 dose comparison study evaluated glatiramer acetate 20 mg and 40 mg each given daily in 1155 patients with MS. The primary endpoint, mean ARR, was s imilar in both groups: ARR = 0 .33 (20 mg group) vs ARR = 0.35 (40 mg group). For patients from both groups who co mpleted the entire 1-year treatment period, the mean ARR = 0.27 (Comi et al 2011) . The efficacy and safety of Plegridy (peginterferon -1a) in adult patients with MS (N = 1516) were evaluated in ADVANCE, a Phase 3, multicenter , randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible adult patie nts had RRMS with baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 5 and 2 clinica lly documented relapses in the previous 3 years with at least 1 relapse in the previous 12 months. Patients were random ized to placebo or SC peginterferon -1a 125 mcg every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Approximately 81% of patients were treatment na\u00efve. o At week 48, ARRs were significa ntly lower in the peginterferon -1a every 2 week group ( ARR = 0.256; p = 0.0007) and peginterferon -1a every 4 week group (ARR = 0.288; p = 0.0 114) compared to placebo (ARR = 0.397). o There were also significant differences between the peginterfer on -1a every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks groups compared to placebo in the proportion of patients with relapse at week 48 (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.02, respectively). The proportions of patients with 12 weeks of sustained disabili ty progression at the end of the 48 week study period were significantly lower in the peginterferon -1a groups (both 6.8%; p = 0.0383 for ever y 2 weeks group; p = 0.038 for every 4 weeks group) co mpared to placebo (10.5%). o The mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesio ns on MRI were significantly reduced in the peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks group compared to placebo (3.6 lesions vs 10.9 lesions , respectively; p < 0.0001). Significant beneficial effects on the mean number of Gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions were also observed with peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks compared to placebo (p < 0.000 1). o During the 48 weeks of treatmen t, the most commonly reported ad verse effects included influenza-like illness and injection site erythema. Disc ontinuations due to adverse effect s were higher in the pegi nterferon -1a groups compared to placebo (Calabresi et al 2014b) . o NAb to interferon -1a were identified in < 1% of all groups after 1 year (peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks, 4 patients; peginterferon -1a eve 4 weeks, 2 2 patients) (Calabresi et al 2014b) . Preliminary data on NAb development to peginterfer on -1a over 2 y ears showed < 1% for all groups (White et al 2014) . The ADVANCE study continued into a second year. Patients origin ally randomized to placebo were re-randomized to peginterferon -1a (the \"placebo- switch group\"). Peginterferon -1a patients were continued on their original assigned therapy. A total of 1332 patient s entered the second year of th e study. After 96 weeks, the AR R was significantly lower in the peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks group (ARR 0.221; p = 0 .0001 vs placebo-switch group ; p = 0.0209 vs every 4 week regimen) compared to both t he placebo-switch group (ARR 0.351) and the peginterferon -1a every 4 week group (ARR 0.291). The peginterferon -1a every 4 week group (ARR 0.2 91; p = NS vs placebo-sw itch group) was not significantly different than the placebo-switch group (ARR 0.35 1) after 96 weeks based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks was also associated with a lower proportion of patients who had relapse and a lower proportion of patients who had disability progression. Mean number of new or newl y enlarging T2-weight hyperintense MRI lesions over 2 years was numerically lower wit h the peginterferon - 1a every 2 weeks group compared to the placebo-switch group (Calabresi et al 2014b, Kieseier et al 2015) . The ATTAIN study was an open-lab el extension of the ADVANCE stu dy, where patients were followed for an additional 2 years ( Newsome et al 2018 ). Of the original ADVANCE pati ents, 71% continued into the ATT AIN study, and 78% of those patients completed the ex tension study. The primary objec tive of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety of peginterferon -1a. During the study, the common adverse events were influenza-like illne ss (43%), injection site erythema (41%), and headache ( 29%). The rate of treatment-relat ed serious adverse even ts was 1%. The adjusted ARR and risk of relaps e was reduced significantly with the ever y 2 weeks compared to the ev ery 4 weeks dosing group (0.188 2 large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults against placebo and against Avonex (IFN-1a IM). In FREEDOMS, a 24-month placebo-co ntrolled trial, fingolimod (0.5 and 1.25 mg once daily) was associated with signi ficant reductions in ARR compared to placebo (54 and 60%, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Moreover, fingolim od was associated wi th reductions in d isability progression and a prolonged time to first relapse compared to placebo (Kappos et al 2010) . In the 12-month TRANSFORMS tr ial, fingolimod 0.5 and 1.25 mg once daily 90 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 6 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In a 12-month extens ion of TRANSFORMS, patients initially randomized to IFN-1a IM were switched to either dose of fingo limod for 12 additional months and experienced significant reductions in ARR compared to initial treatment with IFN- 1a IM. Patients switched from IF N-1a IM to fingolimod experienced fewer adverse events compared to treatment with IFN-1a IM in the core study (86 vs 91% and 91 vs 94% for the 0.5 and 1.25 mg groups, respectively; p values not repor ted). Fewer patients continuing fingolimod from the core stu dy reported adverse events in the extension period compared to the core study (72 vs 86% a nd 71 vs 90% for the 0.5 and 1.25 mg doses, respectively; p va lues not reported) (Khatri et al 2011) . The TRANSFORMS extension st udy followed patients for up to 4.5 years with results consisten t with those observed in the fi rst 12 months of the extension study; however, there was significant attrition bias with very few patients enrolled past 36 months (Cohen et al 2015) . In the FREEDOMS II study, a 24-month placebo-controlled study, fingolimod (0.5 mg and 1.25 m g) significantly reduced ARR compared to placebo (48 and 50%, respectively ; both p < 0.0 001) (Calabresi et al 2014a) . Mean percentage brain volume change was lower with both fingolimod doses compared to placebo. Fingolimod did not show a significant effect on time to disability progression at 3 months compared to place bo. Fingolimod has also been evaluat ed in pediatric patients with r elapsing MS ( Chitnis et al 2018). The PARADIGMS trial randomized patients between 10 an d 17 years of age to fingolimod 0.5 mg daily (0.25 mg for patients 40 kg) or IFN- 1a IM 30 mcg weekly for up to 2 years. Fingolimod significantly reduced ARR compared to IFN -1a IM (adjusted rates, 0.12 vs 0.67; relative differenc e of 82%; p < 0.001). Fingolimod was also associated with a 53% relative reduction in the annualized rate of new or newly enlarged lesions. However, seri ous adverse events occurr ed more frequently with fingolimod than IFN-1a IM (16.8% vs 6.5%). Aubagio (teriflunomide) Efficacy and safety of Aubagio were evaluated in two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials - the TEMSO trial ( O'Connor et al, 2011 ) and the TOWER trial (Confavreux et al 2014) . In the TEMSO trial, 1088 patients with relapsing MS were randomized to te riflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or placebo for a total of 108 weeks. Results demonstrated that compared to p lacebo, teriflunomide at both doses, reduced the ARR. o The percentage of pat ients with confirmed disability progressio n (CDP) was significant ly lower only in the teriflunomide 14 mg group (20.2% ) compared to placebo (27.3%; p = 0.03) (O'Connor et al 2011) . Teriflunomide has demonstrated beneficial effects on MRI scans in a Phase 2, randomized, doubl e-blind, clinical trial. A total of 179 patients with MS were randomized to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or placebo for 36 weeks and were followed every 6 weeks with MRI s cans during the treatment peri od. The teriflunomide groups had significant reductions in the average number of unique active lesions per MRI scan (O'Connor et al 2006) . In the TOWER trial, 1165 patients with relapsing MS were random ized to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or placebo for at least 48 weeks of ther apy. The study ended 48 weeks afte r the last patient was randomized. Results demonstrated that, compared to p lacebo, teriflunomide 14 mg sig nificantly reduced the ARR and the risk of sustained accumulation of disability (Confavreux et al 2014) . Teriflunomide and Rebif were comp ared in the 48-week TENERE study evaluating 324 patients with relapsing MS. The primary outcome, time to failure defined as a confirmed relapse or permanent discontinuation for any cause, was comparable for teriflunomi de 7 mg and 14 mg and Rebif o Phase 3 stud ies: DEFINE and CONFIRM (Gold et al 2012, Fox et al 2012, Xu et al 2015) . DEFINE was a multicenter RCT t hat compared 2 dosing regimens of dimethyl fumarate (240 mg twice daily and 240 mg 3 times da ily) to placebo in patients with RRMS. There were 1237 patients enrolled, and the trial duration was 96 weeks. Results d emonstrated that, compared to placebo, treatment with both doses of dimethyl fumarate reduced the proportion of patients with a relapse with in 2 years, the ARR, the number of lesions on MRI, and the proportion of patients with disability progression (Gold et al 2012) . CONFIRM was a multicenter RCT t hat compared 2 dosing regimens o f dimethyl fumarate (240 mg twice daily and 240 mg 3 times daily) to placebo, with an additional, open-label st udy arm evaluating glatiramer acetate 20 mg SC daily. Glatiramer acetate was included as a reference comparator, but the study was not designed to test the superiority or non-inferiority of dimethyl fuma rate vs glatiramer acetate. The re were 1430 patients enrolled, and the trial duration was 96 weeks. Results of CONFIRM were similar to DEFINE, with the e xception that there was no significant difference between groups in the likelihood of disability progression. The CONFIRM trial demonstrated that, compared to placebo, 91 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 7 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Tysabri (natalizumab) Tysabri (natalizumab) reduced the risk of experiencing at least 1 new exacerbation at 2 y ears and reduced the risk of experiencing progression at 2 years (Polman et al 2006, Pucci et al 2011, Rudick et al 2006) . The AFFIRM trial compared natalizumab to placebo in patients with MS with less t han 6 months of treatment experience with any DMT. Natalizumab reduced the ARR at 1 and 2 years compared to placeb o. The cumulative probabilit y of sustained disability progression and lesion burden on MRI were significantly reduced with natalizumab compared to placebo (Polman et al 2006) . In the SENTINEL trial, nataliz umab was compared to placebo in patients who were receiving IFN-1a IM 30 mcg once weekly for at least 1 year. T he combination of natalizumab plus IFN-1a IM resulted in a significant reduction in ARR at year 1 and 2 and significant reduction in cumulative pro bability of sustained disabilit y progression at year 2. Lesion burden on MRI was also significantly reduced with the co mbination therapy. Two cas es of PML were reported in the SENTINEL patient population resulting in the early terminat ion of the trial (Rudick et al 2006) . Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) The efficacy and of alem compared to Rebif (IFN-1a SC) in two Phase 3, open-label trials in patients with relapsi ng forms of MS - CARE-MS I and C ARE-MS II ( Cohen et al 2012, Coles et al 2012) . In the 2-year studies, patients were randomized to alemtuzumab infused for 5 consecutive days followed by a 3 consecutive day treatment course 12 months lat er or to Rebif (IFN-1a SC) 4 4 mcg 3 times weekly after an initial dosage titration. All patients received methylprednisolo ne 1 g IV for 3 consecutive d ays at the initiation of tr eatment and at month 12. o The CARE-MS I trial enrolled treat ment-na\u00efve patients with MS ( n = 581) who were high functioning based on the requirement of a score of 3 or lower on the EDSS. o Patients (n = 840) enrolled in t he CARE-MS II trial had experie nced at least 1 relapse while on IFN or glatiramer acetate after at least 6 months of treatment. Patients were req uired to have an EDSS score of 5. o The co-primary endpoints for both trials were the relapse rate and the time to 6-month sustained accumulation of disability. o In the CARE-MS I trial, alemtuz umab reduced the risk of relapse 55% compared to IFN-1a SC (p < 0.0001). Relapses were in alemtuzumab-treated patients a nd 40% of IFN-1a SC patients over 2 years. The proportion of patients having su stained accumulation of disabil ity over 6 months was not significantly different between alemtuzumab (8%) vs IFN-1a SC (11%) (p = uzumab significa ntly reduced relapse disability compared to IFN-1a SC. The rela pse rate at 2 years was reduced by 49% with alemtuzumab (p < 0.0001). The percent of patients with sustai ned accumulation of disability c onfirmed over 6 months was 13% with alemtuzumab and 20% with IFN-1a SC, represent ing a 42% risk reduction with alemtuzumab (p = 0.0084). o Both studies evaluated MRI outco mes, specifically the median pe rcent change in T2 hyperintense lesion volume from baseline. Neither study found a significant difference between the 2 drugs for this measure. o During extension studies of CAR E-MS I and CARE-MS II, approxima tely 80% of patients pr eviously treated with alemtuzumab did not require additional treatment during the fir st year (Garnock-Jones 2014) . A Cochrane review by Zhang et al (2017) that compared the effic acy, tolerability, and safety of alemtuzumab vs IFN-1a in the treatment of RRMS identified 3 RCTs in 1694 total patients from the CARE-MS I, CARE-MS II, and CAMMS223 studies. In the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group, the results showed statistically significan t differences in reducing relapses (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0. 52 to 0.70); preventing disease progression (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.79); and developing new T2 lesions on MRI (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0. 93) after 24 and 36 months' follow-up, but found no statistically significant diffe rence in the changes of EDSS sco re (MD = -0.35, 95% CI: -0.73 to 0.03). In the alemtuzumab 24 mg/day group, the results show ed statistically significant d ifferences in reducing relaps es (RR = 0.38, 95% CI: 95% to 0.84); (MD = 95% CI: reported adverse effe cts with alemtuzumab were infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune event s. Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) The Phase 3 clinical developmen t program for ocrelizumab (ORCHE STRA) included 3 stud ies: OPERA I, OPERA II, and ORATORIO (Hauser et al 2017[a], Montalban et al 2017) . 92 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 8 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Across both studies, the majori ty of patients had not been trea ted with a DMT in the 2 years before screening (range: 71.4% to 75.3%); of those patients that had received a previous DMT as allowed by the protocol, most received IFN (18.0% to 21.0%) or glatiramer acetate (9.0% to 10 .6%). Two patients previously treated with natalizumab for < 1 year were in cluded, while 5 patients previo usly treated with fingolimod and 1 patient previously treated with dimethyl fumarate ( both not within 6 months of scr eening) were also included. Ocrelizumab achieved statistically significant reductions in th e ARR vs Rebif across both trials (primary endpoint). OPERA I (0.16 vs 0.29; 46% lower rate with ocrelizumab; p < 0. 001) OPERA II (0.16 vs 0.29; 47% lower rate; p < 0.001) In pre-specified pooled analyses (secondary endpoints), the per centage of patients with disability progression confirmed at 12 weeks was statistically significantly lower wit h ocrelizumab vs Rebif (9.1% vs 13.6%; hazard ratio [HR] 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.81; p < 0.001). The results were similar for disability pr ogression conf irmed at 24 weeks: 6.9% 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.84; p = 0.00 3. The percentages of pat ients with disability improvement confirmed at 12 week s were 20.7% in the ocrelizumab group vs 15.6% in the Rebif group (33% higher rate of improvement w ith ocrelizumab; p = 0.02). The mean numbers of Gd-enhancing lesions per T1-weighted MRI scan were statistically sig nificantly reduced with ocrelizumab vs Rebif (secondary endpoint). rati = 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.10 ; 94% lower number of lesions with ocrelizumab; p < 0.001) OPERA II: 0.02 vs 0.42 (rate ra tio = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.0 9; 95% lower number o f lesions; p < 0.001) The most common adverse events we re infusion-related reactions and infections. o No opportunistic infections, inc luding PML, were reported in an y group over the duration of either trial. An imbalance of malignancies was observed with ocrelizumab; acr oss both studies and through 96 weeks, neoplasms occurred in 0.5% (4/825) of ocrelizumab-treated patie ocrelizumab-treated pat ients that developed neoplasms , there were 2 cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma, 1 case of renal-cell carcinoma, and 1 case of malign ant melanoma. Rebif-treated patients with neoplasms included 1 case of mant le-cell lymphoma and 1 case of squamous-cell carcinoma in the chest. Between the clinical cutoff dat es of the 2 trials (April 2, 20 15 [OPERA I] and May 12, 2015 [OPERA II]) and June 30, 2016, 5 additional cases of neoplasm (2 cases of breast cancer, 2 cases of basal-cell skin carcinoma, and 1 case of malignant melanoma) were observed during the OL extensi on phase in which all continuing patients received ocrelizumab. o ORATORIO was an event-driven, P hase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, RCT evaluating the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab (600 mg administered by IV infusion e very 6 months; given as 2- 300 mg infusions 2 weeks apart for each dose) compared wi th placebo in 732 people with P PMS (Montalban et al 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov Web site, Ocrevus Formulary Submission Dossier 2017). Double-blind treatment was administered for a minimum of 5 doses (120 weeks) until the occurrence of ~ 253 events of disability progression in the tria l cohort that was confirmed for at least 12 weeks. The majority of patients (~88%) reported no previous use of DMT s within 2 years of trial entry. The proportion of patients with Gd-enhancing lesion s was similar (27.5% in the oc relizumab group vs 24.7% in the placebo group); however, there was an imbalance in the mean number of Gd-enhanc ing lesions at baseline, with nearly 50% fewer lesions in the placebo gr oup (1.21 vs 0.6) ( FDA Medical and Summary Reviews 2017 ). The percentages of pat ients with 12-week c onfirmed disability p rogression (primary endpoi nt) were 32.9% with vs 39.3% with placebo (HR = 0.76, CI: to 0 .98; relative risk reduc tion of 24%; p = 0.03). The percentages of patients with 24-week CDP (secondary endpoin t) were 0 .98; relative risk reduction of 25%; p = 0.04). Additional secondary endpoints in cluded changes in the timed 25 -foot walk, the total volu me of hyperintense brain lesions on T2-weighted MRI, and brain volume loss. 93 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 9 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. The proportion of patients with 20% worsening of the timed 25- foot walk confirmed at 12 weeks was 49% in ocrelizumab-treated patients co mpared to 59% in placebo-treated patients (25% risk reduction). From baseline to Week 120, the total volume of hyperintense br ain lesions on T2-weighted MRI decreased by 3.37% in ocrelizumab-t reated patients and increased by 7.43% in placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). From Weeks 24 to 120, the percent age of brain volume loss was 0.90% with ocrelizumab vs 1.09% with placebo (p = 0.02). Infusion-related reactions, uppe r respiratory tract infections, and oral herpes infections occurred more frequently with ocrelizumab vs placebo. Neoplasms occurred in 2.3% (11/486) of patients treated with oc relizumab vs 0.8% (2/239) of patients who received placebo. Among the ocre lizumab-treated patients that d eveloped neoplasms, there were 4 cases of breast cancer, 3 cases of basal-cell carcinoma, and 1 case in each of the following: endometrial adenocarcinoma, anaplastic histiocytoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. In the placebo group, 1 patient develope d cervical adenocarcinoma in s itu and 1 patient developed basal-cell carcinoma. Between the clinical cutoff date (July 24, 2015) and June 30, 2016, 2 additional cases of neoplasm (1 case of basal-cell skin carcinoma and 1 case of squamous-cell carcinoma ) were detected during the open-label extension phase in which all patients received ocrelizumab. Mayzent (siponimod) The Phase 3 trial, EXPAND r andomized, paral lel-group, placebo-controll ed, time-to-event study in patients with SPMS w ho had evidence of disability progression in the previous 2 years ( Bar-Or et al 2018, Fox et al 2015, Kappos et al 2018 ). o A total of 1651 patients were r andomized to treatment with eith er siponimod 2 mg (n = 1105) or placebo (n = 546). o A total of 82% of the siponimod- treated patients and 78% of placebo-treated patients co mpleted the study. The median age of patients was 49.0 years, 95% of patients were white, and 60% were female. For the primary endpoint, 288 (26% ) of 1096 patients receiving siponimod and 173 (32%) o f 545 patients receiving placebo had a 3-month CDP (HR 0.79: 95% CI: 21%; = 0.013). Key secondary endpoints included time to 3-month confirmed wors ening of at least 20% from baseline in T25FW and change from baseline in T2 lesi on volume on MRI. Siponimod did not show a significant difference in T25FW. Patients treated with siponimod had a 55% relative reduction in ARR (0.071 vs 0.16), compar ed to placebo (nominal p < 0.01). The absolut e reduction in the ARR was 0.089 with sip onimod. Mavenclad (cladribine) The 96-week a double-blind, 3-arm, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral cladribine in 1326 patients with RR MS ( Giovannoni et al 2010 , Giovannoni 2017 ). o Patients were required to have at least 1 relapse in the previo us 12 months. The median patient age was 39 years and the female-to-male ratio was 2:1. The mean duration of MS p rior to study reenro llment was 8.7 years. o Patients were randomized to recei ve either placebo (n = 437), o r a cumulative oral dose of c ladribine 3.5 mg/kg (n = 433) or 5.25 mg/kg (n = 456) over the 96-week study period in 2 treatment courses. o The primary outcome was ARR. o ARRs at 96 weeks were reduced in both cladribine treatment grou ps vs placebo (0.14, 0.15, and 0.33 in the 3.5 mg/kg, 5.25 mg/kg and placebo gr oups, respectivel y; each p < 0. 001). o A significantly higher percentage of patients remained relapse- free at 96 weeks both in the cladribine treatment groups vs placebo; a total of 79.7% and 78.9% of patients in th e 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/k g groups, respectively, were relapse free vs 60.9% in the placebo group (each p < 0.001 vs placebo). o Cladribine 3.5 mg/kg signific antly lowered the ARR vs the 5.25 mg/kg treatment group. Symptomatic MS Despite the demonstrated effica cy of DMTs, for many patients th ere is little evidence of their effect on quality of life (QOL) in general or symptom m anagement in particular. Impaired mobility contributes to dir ect and indirect costs (Miravelle et al 2011) . o Ampyra (dalfampridine) is the only FDA-approved agent for the symptomatic treatment of i mpaired mobility in patients with MS. Improvement o f walking ability with dalfampridine was demonstrated in two 14-week, double-blind, Phase 3, RCTs of 540 patients of all MS types. Compared to plac ebo, dalfampridine significantly improved the 94 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 10 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

To ad dress the benefit of long-term therapy with dalfampridine, an open-label, obser vational study of 52 MS pati ents with impaired mobility was conduct ed. Results demonstrated that about 60% of patients were still on treatment after 9 to 12 months. Two weeks after treatment initiation, significant ameliorations could be found for T25FW, maximum walking distance, as well as motoric and cognitive fatigue, which persi sted after 9 to 12 months (Ruck et al 2014) . Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) Avonex (IFN-1a IM) and Betaser on (IFN-1b) are FDA-approved fo r the treatment of the first c linical episode with MRI features consistent with MS. C opaxone (glatiramer acetate) and Aubagio (teriflunomide) hav e evidence supporting a significant delay in the time to development of a second exacer bation, compared to placebo, in patients with an isolated demyelinating event. In the PRECISE trial, glatirame r acetate significantly reduced the risk of converting to a CDMS diagnosis by 45% compared to placebo in patients with CIS (p = 0.005). In additi on, the time for 25% of patients to convert to CDMS was significantly prolonged with gla tiramer acetate compared to pla cebo (722 vs 336 days; p = 0.0041) (Comi et al 2009) . In the 2 year, open-label extension phase of PRECISE, early initia tion of glatiramer acetate demonstrated a 41% reduced risk to 0.8; p 0 .0005). Over the 2 year extension, the baseline-adjusted proportions of patients who de veloped CDMS were 29.4% and 46.5% for the early and late initiation treatment groups (odds ratio [OR]: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.7; . A meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with CIS fo und a significantly lower risk of CDMS with IFN therapy compa red to placebo (p < (Clerico et al 2008) . A 10-year, multicenter, randomized clinical trial with IFN-1a IM demonstrated that immediate initiation of therapy in patients wi th CIS reduced the risk for relapses over 10 years, but it was not associated with improved disability outcomes compared to a control group that also initiated therapy relati vely early in the disease (Kinkel et al 2012) . Over the 10-year study , the drop-out rate was significant. Similar results were observed with IFN-1b (BENEFI T study) over an 8-year obs ervation period. Patients who received treatment early had a lower overall ARR compared t o those patients who delayed treatment (Kappos et al 2007, Edan et al 2014) . In the first 3 years of BENEFIT, early treatment with IFN-1b reduced the risk for progression of disability by 40% compared to delayed treatment (16% vs 25%, re spectively; HR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0 .39 to 0.92; p = 0.022). A 2018 systematic revie w and network meta-analysis of RCTs was conducted to assess the pot ential short- and long- term benefits of treatment with IF N- or glatiramer acetate in patients with CIS (Armoiry et al 2018) . The review identified 5 primary RCTs that a ssessed the time to clinically definite multiple sclerosis ( CDMS) in patients with CIS treated with IFN- or glatiram er acetate vs placebo. They found that all drugs reduced the time to CDMS when compared with placebo, with a pooled HR of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.44 t o 0.61) and low heterog eneity, and there was no evidence that indicated that 1 a ctive treatment was superior to another when compared indi rectly. The authors noted that there was insufficient infor mation to rate the risk of sel ection bias, 4 of the 5 studi es were at high risk of performance bias, and 1 study w as rated to have a high risk for attrition bias. Four of the tr ials had open-label extension studies performed over 5 to 10 y ears, all of which indicated th at early DMT therapy (rega rdless of agent) led to an increase in time to CDMS when com pared with place bo (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.74; l should be taken with caut ion; however, as all of the op en-label extension arms were at a high risk for attrition bias and had large losses to follow-up noted. The TOPIC study enrolled 618 pat ients with CIS and found terifl unomide 7 and 14 mg doses r educed the risk of relapse defining CDMS compared to placebo (Miller et al 2014) . Teriflunomide 14 mg reduced the risk of conversion to CDMS by 42.6% compared to placebo (HR, 0.574; 95% C 0.379 to 0.869 ; p = 0.0087) whereas teriflunomide 7 mg reduced the conversion to CDMS by 37.2% compared to placebo (HR, 0.628; 95% CI: 0.416 to 0.949; p = 0.0271). Progressive MS Limited treatment options are a vailable for patients with non-a ctive SPMS FDA-approved for treating SPMS, while ocrelizumab has been specifically approved for the treatment of PPMS (and relapsing forms of MS). Mitoxantrone was shown to reduce the clinical relapse rate and disease progression in aggressive RRMS, SPMS, and progressive-relapsing MS (Hartung et al 2002, Krapf et al 2005) . For MRI outcome measures, mitoxantrone was not statistically significantly dif ferent than placebo at month 12 or 24 for the total number of M RI scans with positive Gd 95 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 11 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

However, the basel ine MRI lesion number and characteristics were d ifferent among the groups (Krapf et al 2005) . In 2010, Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology ev aluated all published data i ncluding cohort data for mitoxantrone. Evaluation of efficacy found that mitoxantron e is probably effective in mode stly reducing clinical attack rate, MRI activity, and disease progression. A confirmatory tri al is necessary before widespread adoption of mitoxantrone for DMT for MS can be made in light of the risks o f cardiotoxicity and treat ment-related leukemia (Marriott et al 2010) . The results of studies with the other agents for MS have failed to consistently demonstrate a benefit in progressive forms of MS, and due to being off-label , these uses are not included in Table 2. In the PROMISE tria l, glatiramer acetate was no more effective than placebo in delaying the time to accumula ted disability for patients with PPMS (Wolinsky et al 2007) . The ASCEND trial evaluated nata lizumab in SPMS was found to h ave no significant difference in the rate of confirmed disability progre ssion compared to placebo ( Kapoor et al 2018 ). Several IFN trials in this population have yielded conflicting results (Rizvi et al 2004) . A systematic analysis evaluated 5 clinical trials (N = 3082) of IFN compared to placebo in the treatment of SPMS. In 4 trials with the primary outcome of sustained disability progression at 3 or 6 months, IFN demonst rated no benefit. The risk ratio for sustained progression with IFN was 0.98 (95% CI: was high (I2 = 57%) (La Mantia et al 2013) . Timing of DMT initiation A 2017 systematic review by Merke l et al (2017) evaluated the e ffect imm unotherapies (ie, fingolimod, natalizumab, alemtuzumab) at diffe rent stages of MS. Twelve publications (9 RCTs + 3 obse rvational studies) were identified as reporting informa tion relevant to the outcomes of early vs delayed initiation of high-efficacy DMTs for RRMS. A number of these studies s uggested that earlier commencement of high-efficacy D MTs resulted in more effective control of relapse act ivity than their later initiati on. The evidence regarding the effect of the timing of high- efficacy therapies on disabilit y outcomes was conflicting; addi tional data are required to answer this question. Decisions to discontinue DMTs in MS Patient with RRMS eventually progress to SPMS. Patients experience worsening dis ability with or without relapses. Current therapies focus on relap sing forms of MS and are not in dicated for non-active SPMS. The decision to discontinue DMTs has not been well studied. The Agency for Heal thcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published a comparative effectiveness review evaluating the decision dilemm as surrounding discontinuati on of MS therapies in the setting of progressive disease and pregnancy (Butler et al 2015) . No studies directly assess continued therapy vs discontinued therapy for MS in comparable populations. Based on low strength of evidence, long- term all-cause survival is higher for treatment-na\u00efve M S patients who did not delay sta rting IFN-1b by 2 years and used DMT for a longer duration than those who delayed therapy. Very little evidence i s available about t he benefits and risks o f discontinuation of therapy for MS in women who desire pregnancy (Rae-Grant et al 2018[b] ). Meta-Analyses A 2017 systematic review conducted by the Institute for Clinica l and Economic Review (ICER) included ocrelizumab in a comparative efficacy analysis with other DMTs used in the treat ment of MS. o Network meta-analyses demonstr ated that for the treatment of RRMS, alemtuzumab, natalizumab, and ocrelizumab (in that order) were the most e ffective DMTs for reducing ARRs (~70% reduction vs placebo). o Ocrelizumab and alemtuzumab had the greatest reductions in disa bility progression (53% to 58% reduction vs placebo, respectively), closely fo llowed by natalizumab (44%). A systematic review that ident ified 28 RCTs found that the magn itude of ARR reduction vari ed between 15 to 36% for all IFN products, glatiramer acet ate, and teriflunomide; alemtuzum ab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and natalizumab. The risk of 3-month disability pro gression was reduced by 19 to 28% with IFN products, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, et al 2016) . RCTs (n = 39) evaluating 1 of 15 treatments for MS were analyze d for benefits and acceptabili ty in 25,113 patients with RRMS (Tramacere et al 2015) . Drugs included were mab and laquinimod, were also included.

The network meta-analysis evaluated the recurrence of relapses and disability progression. o Relapses: alemtuzumab, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, and fingolimod were reported to have greater treatment benefit compared to placebo. Over 12 mont hs (29 studies; N = 17,897): alemtuzumab: RR = .20 to RR = 0.56, quality evid ence RR = 0.63, ality evidence 0.79, uality evidence Relapses over 24 months vs plac ebo (26 studies; 0.47, 95% CI: 0 .27 to 0.81; very low quality evidence natalizumab: RR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0. 47 to = 0.72, 0. 64 to 0.81; moderate quality e vidence o Disability worsening over 24 months vs placebo (26 studies; N = 16,800): mitoxantrone: RR = 0.20, = 95% 0 .26 = 0.64, moderate quality evidence o Relapses and disabilit y worsening over 36 months were only tested in 2 studies (CombiRx and CAMMS223). Both studies had a high risk of bias. o Acceptability: Higher rates of withdrawal due to adverse events compared to placebo over 12 months were reported for teriflunomide (RR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.5 CI: 2.5 9 to 9); and fingolimod (R R = 8.26, 95% CI: 3.25 to 20.97). o Over 24 months, only fingolimod had a significantly higher prop ortion of participants who withdrew due to any adverse event (RR vs placebo = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.32 to 2.17). to 1.61 Filippini et al (2013) conducted a Cochrane review of 44 RCTs o n the relative effectiveness and acceptability of DMTs and immunosuppressants in patients with either RRMS or progress ive MS (N = 17,401). o On the basis of high quality evi dence, natalizumab and Rebif we re superior to all other tr eatments for preventing clinical relapses in the short-te rm (24 months) in RRMS compared to placebo (OR = 0.32, 9 5% CI: 0.24 to 0.43; OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.71, res pectively); they were also mor e effective than Avonex (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.36; OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0. 06 to 0.6, respectively). o Based on moderate quality evidence, natalizumab and Rebif decre ased the odds of patients with RRMS having disability progressio n in the short-term, with an absolute redu ction of 14% and 10%, vs placebo. o Natalizumab and Betaseron more 0 .78; OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.7, respectively) than Avonex in reducing the number o f patients with RRMS who h ad progression at 2 years of follow-up, and confidence in th is result was graded as moder ate. o The lack of convincing efficacy data showed that Avonex, IV imm unoglobulins (IVIG), cyclophosphamide, and long- term corticosteroids have an unfavorable benefit-risk balance i n RRMS. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH ) conducted a systematic review of 30 RCTs to assess the comparativ e clinical- and cost-effectiveness of drug therapies for the treatment of RRMS (N,= 16,998) (CADTH, 2013). Results suggested that all acti ve treatments produce statistic ally significant reductions in ARR compared with no treatment, and t hat there were clear between-t reatment differences. o Compared with no treatment, reductions in the ARR were approxim ately 70% for natalizum ab IFNs, acetate, or teriflunomide. o Among active ARRs wer e lower 0.63) compared addition, ARRs were statistically lower for 0.62 to 0.93) compar ed with glatiramer acetate. 97 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 13 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Compared wi th glatiramer acetate, Tecfidera resulted in a lower mean number of T2 lesions, but th e mean number of Gd-enhancing lesions was not statistically different bet ween these 2 treatments. o The incidence of serious adverse events and treatment discontinuations did not differ significantly between treatments in the majority of tr ials, except for a higher incidence of treatment discontinuation for Rebif compared to placebo and alemtuzumab. Hamidi et al (2018) conducted a sy stematic review and network meta-analysis of 37 studies including 26 RCTs from a health technology assessment (HTA) report and 11 supplemental RCTs published after t he HTA. Eleven agents, including alemtuzumab were included and were compared to either placebo o r any drug treatment in pati ents of varying treatment experience levels. Key findings fr om the network meta-analysis include: o Alemtuzumab 12 mg had the highest probability of preventing ann ual relapses (RR = 0.29, 9 5% CI: 0.23 to 0.35; high quality evidence). o Alemtuzumab 24 mg (RR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.7; low quality evidence) mg (RR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.60; very low qu ality evidence) were the most effective against progr ession of disability. o Dimethyl fumarate 240 mg and fingo limod 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg were more effective treatments when considering annual relapse and disability progression: Annual relapse: Dimethyl fumarate 0.42 to 0.6; 0.45, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.71, 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.90; high qual ity evidence o Withdrawal due to adverse event s was difficult to assess due to the low quality of available evidence, however, the authors determined that: Fingolimod 1.25 mg (RR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.42 to 2.5; moderate qu ality f 44 mcg (RR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.29 to 3.97; low quality evidence) were associated wit h higher withdrawals due to adverse events when compared with other treatment options. o Alemtuzumab 24 mg (mean differe nce = -0.91; 95% CI: -1.48 to -0 .40), 12 difference = -0.6; 95% CI: -1.02 to -0.24) were more effective than other therapies in low ering the EDSS. o No treatments were found to significantly increase serious adve rse events; peginterferon - 1a was associated with more adverse events overall w hen compared with other medication s (RR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.21 to 2.28). o None of the 11 agents studied were a ssociated with a statistica lly significantly higher risk of mortality when compared to placebo. A Bayesian network meta-analysis e valuating DMTs for RRMS ranke d most effective therapies based on SUCRA analysis ( Lucchetta et al 2018 ). A total of 33 studies were included in the analysis. For the ARR, alemtuzumab (96% probability), natalizumab (96%), and ocrelizumab (85%) be most effective therapies (high-quality evidence). A meta-analysis of randomized c ontrolled trials was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of teriflunomide in reducing the frequency of relapse s and progression of physical disability in patients with r elapsing multiple sclerosis ( Xu et al 2016 ). The results showed that teriflunomide (7 and 14 mg) reduced the ARR and teriflunomide 14 mg decreased the disability progre ssion in comparison to placebo (RR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.87). 98 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 14 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CLINICAL GUIDELINES The European Committee for Resear ch and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) published updated guidelines in 2018 ( Montalban et al 2018 ). The main recommendations reported were the following: o The entire spectrum of disease-modifying drugs should be prescr ibed only in centers with adequate infrastructure to provide proper monitoring of pat ients, comprehensive assessment , detection of side effect s, and capacity to address them properly. (Consensus statement) o Offer IFN or glatiramer acetate to patients with CIS and abnorm al MRI findings with lesions suggesting MS who do not fulfill full criteria for MS. (Strong) o Offer early treatment with diseas e-modifying drugs in patients with active RRMS, as defined by clinical relapses and/or MRI activity (active lesi ons: contrast-enhancing lesions; new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions assessed at least annually). (Strong) o For active RRMS, choosing among the wide range of available dru gs from the modestly effective to the highly effective will depend on patient c haracteristics and comorbidit y, disease severity/activit y, drug safety profile, and accessibility of the drug . (Consensus statement) o Consider treatment with IFN in patients with active SPMS, takin g into account, in discussion with the patient, the dubious efficacy, as well as saf ety and tolerability profile. ( Weak) o Consider treatment with mitoxantrone in patients with active SPMS, taking into account the efficacy and specifically the safety and tolerability profile of this agent. (Weak) o Consider ocrelizumab for pati ents with active SPMS. (Weak) o Consider ocrelizumab for patients with PPMS. (Weak) o Always consult the summary of pr oduct characteristics for dosag e, special warnings, and precautions of use, contraindications, and monitori ng of side effects and potential harms. (Consensus statement) o Consider combining MRI with clin ical measures when evaluating d isease evolution in treated patients. (Weak) o When monitoring treatment respons e in patients treated with dis ease-modifying drugs, perform standardized reference brain MRI within 6 months of treatment onset and comp are the results with thos e of further brain MRI, typically performed 12 months after starting treatment. Adjust the timing of both MRIs, taki ng into account the drug's mechanism and speed of action and disease activity, including clinical and MRI measures. (Consensus statement) o When monitoring treatment respons e in patients treated with dis ease-modifying drugs, the measurement of new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesio ns is the preferred MRI method, supplemented by Gd-enhancing lesions for monitoring treatment response. E valuation of these parameters r equires high-quality standardized MRI scans and interpretation by highly qualifi ed readers with experience in M S. (Consensus statement) o When monitoring treatment safety in patients treated with disea se-modifying drugs, perform standard reference MRI every year in patients at low risk for PML, and more frequently (3 to 6 months) in patient s at high risk for PML (JC virus positivity, natalizumab tr eatment duration over 18 months ) and in patients at high ri sk for PML who switch drugs at the time the current treatmen t is discontinued and the new t reatment is started. (Consensus statement) o Offer a more efficacious drug to patients treated with IFN or g latiramer acetate who show evidence of disease activity, assessed as recommended above. (Strong) o When deciding on which drug to s witch to, in consultation with the patient, consider pati ent characteristics and comorbidities, drug safety profile, and disease severity/activi ty. (Consensus statement) o When treatment with a highly efficacious drug is stopped, wheth er due to inefficacy or safety, consider starting another highly effica cious drug. When star ting the new drug, ta ke into account disease act ivity (clinical and MRI; the greater the disease activity, the greater the urgency to start new treatment), the half-life and biological activity of the previous drug, and the potential for resumed disease activity o r even rebound (particularl y with natalizumab). (Consensus statement) o In treatment decisions, consider the possibility of resumed disease activity or even rebo und when stopping treatment, particularly with natalizumab. (Weak) o Consider continuing a disease-mo difying drug if the patient is stable (clinically and on MR I) and shows no safety or tolerability issues. (Weak) o Advise all women of childbearin g potential that disease-modifyi ng drugs are not licensed during pregnancy, except glatiramer acetate 20 mg/m L. (Consensus statement) 99 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 15 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. o For women planning a pregnancy, if there is a high risk for disease reactivation, consider using IFN or glatiramer acetate until pregnancy is confir med. In some very specific (ac tive) cases, continuing this treatment during pregnancy could also be considered. (Weak) o For women with persistent high disease activity, it would gener ally be advised to delay pre gnancy. For those who still decide to become pregnant or have an unplanned pregnancy, treat ment with natalizumab throughout pregnancy may be considered after full discussi on of potential implications; or treatment with alemtuzumab could be an alternative for planned pregnancy in ve ry active cases provided that a 4-month interval is strictly observe d from the latest infusion until conception. (Weak) The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) performed a systematic review that included 20 Cochrane reviews and 73 additional articles in order to assess the avail able evidence on initiation, switching, and st opping DMTs in patients with MS ( Rae Grant et al 2018[a]) . The results of the systematic review were used to assist in f ormulating updated AAN treatment guidelines (Rae Grant et al 2018[b]) . The main recommendations were as follows: o Starting DMT Clinicians should discuss the benets and risks of DMTs for peo ple with a single clinical demyelinating event with 2 or more brain lesions that have imaging characteristics consistent with MS (Level B). After discussing the risks and benets, clinicians should prescr ibe DMTs to people with a single clinical demyelinating event and 2 or more brain lesions characteristic of MS w ho decide they want this therapy. (Level B) Clinicians should offer DMTs to people with relapsing forms of MS with recent clinical re lapses or MRI activity. (Level B) Clinicians should monitor the re productive plans of women with MS and counsel regarding reproductive risks and use of birth control during DMT use in women of childbearing po tential who have MS. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel men with MS on their reproductive pla ns regarding treatment implications before initiating treatment with teriflunomide. (Level B) Because of the high frequency o f severe adverse events, clinici ans should not prescribe mitoxantrone to people with MS unless the potential t herapeutic benets greatly outwei gh the risks. (Level B) Clinicians should prescribe alem tuzumab, ngolimod, or natalizumab for people with highly active MS. (Level B) Clinicians may initiate natalizumab treatment in people with MS with positive anti-JCV ant ibody indices above 0.9 only when there is a reasonable chance of benet compared with the low but serious r isk of PML. (Level C) Clinicians should offer ocreliz umab to people with PPMS who are likely to benet from this therapy unless there are risks of treatment that outwe igh the benets. (Level B) o Switching DMTs Clinicians should discuss switch ing from one DMT to another in people with MS who have been using a DMT long enough for the treatment to take full effect and are adherent t o their therapy when they experience 1 or more relapses, 2 or more unequivocally new MRI-detected lesions, or increased disabilit y on examination, over a 1-year period of using a DMT. (Level B) Clinicians should evaluate the degree of disease activity, adherence, adverse event proles, and mechanism of action of DMTs when switching DM Ts in people with MS with break through disease activity during DMT use. (Level B) Clinicians should discuss a change to non-injectable or less frequently injected DMTs in people with MS who report intolerable discomfort with the injections or in those who repo rt injection fatigue on injectable DMTs. (Level B) Clinicians should inquire abou t medication adverse events with people with MS who are ta king a DMT and attempt to manage these adverse events, as appropriate (Level B). Clini cians should discuss a medication switch with people with MS for whom these adver se events negatively influence adherence. (Level B) Clinicians should monitor labor atory abnormalities found on req uisite laboratory surveillance (as outlined in the medication's package insert) in people with MS who are using a DMT (Level B). Clinicians s hould discuss switching DMTs or reducing dosage or frequen cy (where there are data on d ifferent doses [eg, int erferons, teriflunomide]) when there are persistent laboratory abnormalities. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel people with MS considering natalizuma b, ngolimod, ocrelizumab, and dimethyl fumarate about the PML risk associated with these agents (Level B). Clin icians should discuss switching to a DMT with a lower PML risk with people with M S taking natalizumab who are o r who become JCV antibody-positive, especially with an index of above 0.9 while on therapy. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel tha t new DMTs without long-term safet y data have an undened risk of malignancy and infection for people with MS star ting or using new DMTs (Level B). If a patient with MS develops a malignancy while using a DMT, clinicians shoul d promptly discuss switching to an alternate DMT, especially for people with MS 100 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 16 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. using ngolimod, teriflunomide, ale mtuzumab, or dimethyl fumarate (Level B). People with MS with serious infections potentially linked to their DMTs should switch DMTs (does not pertain to PML management in people with MS using DMT). (Level B) Clinicians should check for natalizumab antibodies in people wi th MS who have infusion reactions before subsequent infusions, or in peopl e with MS who experience breakthrough disease activity with natalizumab use (Level B). Clinicians should swi tch DMTs in people with MS who have persistent natalizum ab antibodies. (Level B) Physicians must counsel people with MS considering natalizumab discontinuation that there is an increased risk of MS relapse or MRI-detected disease activity within 6 months of discontinuation (Level A ). Physicians and people with MS choosing to switch from natalizumab to ngolimod should initiate treatment within 8 to 12 weeks after natalizumab discontinuation (for reasons other than pregnancy o r pregnancy planning) to d iminish the return of disease activity. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel women to stop their DMT before concep tion for planned pregnanci es unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DMT during pregnancy (Level B). Clinicians should discontinue DMTs during pregnancy if accidental exposure occurs, unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DMT during pregnancy (Level B). Clinicians should not initiate DMTs during pregnancy unless the risk of MS activity during pregnan cy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DM T during pregnancy. (Level B) o Stopping DMTs In people with RRMS who are stab le on DMT and want to discontin ue therapy, clinicians should counsel people regarding the need for ongoing follow-up and periodic reevaluat ion of the decision to discontinue DMT (Level B). Clinicians should advocate tha t people with MS who are stable ( that is, those with no relapses, no disability progression, and stable imaging ) on DMT should continue their c urrent DMT unless the patient and physician decide a trial off therapy is warranted. (Level B) Clinicians should as sess the likelihood of future relapse in individuals with SPMS by assessing patient age, disease duration, relapse history, and MRI-detected activity (eg, frequ ency, severity, time since most recent relapse or gadolinium-enhanced lesion) (Level B). Clinicians may advise discontinuation of DMT in people with SPMS who do not have ongoing relapses (or ga dolinium enhanced lesions on MR I activity) and have not been ambulatory (EDSS 7 or greater) for at l east 2 years. (Level C) Clinicians should review the as sociated risks of continuing DMT s vs those of stopping DM Ts in people with CIS using DMTs who have not been di agnosed with MS. (Level B) According to the 2013 Canadian recommendations for treatment of MS, treatment decisions should be based on the level of concern for the rate and severity of relapses, degree of functional impairment due to relapses and disability progression. First-line treatment recommendations for RRMS incl ude IFN products and acetate. Second-line therapies for RRMS include fingolimod and natalizumab (Freedman et al 2013) . With an increasing number of options for the treatment of RRMS, the place in therapy for an individual agent is not straightforward. Treatment dec isions will likel y be based on a consideration of the risks a nd benefits of each therapy, physician experience, patient com orbidities, and patient prefer ences. The 2015 AAN position statement supports access to all DMT for patients with MS. In addition, step therapy should be driven by evidence-ba sed clinical and safety information and not just based on costs. Highly individualized treatment decisions are neces sary for patients with MS according to the AAN (Corboy et al 2015) . The 2015 Association of British N eurologists state that all available DMTs are effective in reducing relapse rate and MRI lesion accumulation (Scolding et al 2015) . Evidence is less clear on the impact of DMT on long-term disa bility. Drugs are separated into 2 categories based on relative efficacy. Categor y 1 - moderate efficacy include s IFNs glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, - high efficacy includes alemtuzumab and natalizumab - these drugs s hould be reserved for patients w ith very active MS. In September 2018, the MS Coalition published an update to its consensus paper on the prin ciples and current evidence concerning the use of DMTs in MS. Major recommendations include d the following: o Initiation of treatment with an FD A-approved DMT is recommended as soon as possible following a diagnosis of relapsing or primary progressi ve MS, regardless of the person's age; for individuals with a first clinical event and MRI features consistent with MS in whom other possible causes have been excluded; and for individuals with progressive MS who continue to demonstrate c linical relapses and/or demonst rate inflammatory activity. o Clinicians should co nsider prescribing a high efficacy medicati on such as alemtuzumab, fi ngolimod, ocrelizumab or natalizumab for newly-diagnosed individuals with highly active MS. 101 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 17 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. o Treatment with a given DMT shoul d be continued indefinitely unless any of the following oc cur (in which case an alternative DMT should be considered): Suboptimal treatment response as determined by the individual a nd his or her treating clinician Intolerable side effects Inadequate adherence to the treatment regimen Availability of a more appr opriate treatment option The healthcare provide r and patient deter mine that the benefits no longer outweigh the risks. o Movement from one DMT to another should occur only for medicall y appropriate reasons as determined by the treating clinician and patient. o When evidence of additional clinical or MRI activity while on t reatment suggests a sub-optimal response, an alternative regimen (eg, differ ent mechanism of action) should be considered to optimize therapeutic benefit. o Due to significant v ariability in the MS p opulation, people wit h MS and their treating clinicians require access to the full range of treatment optio ns for several reasons: Different mechanisms of action allow for treatment change in th e event of a sub-optimal response. Potential contraindications limit options for some individuals. Risk tolerance varies among people with MS and their treating c linicians. Route of delivery, frequency of dosing, and side effects may af fect adherence and quality of life. Individual differences related to tolerability and adherence ma y necessitate access to different medications within the same class. Pregnancy and breastfeeding lim it the available options. o Individuals' access to treatment s hould not be limited by their frequency of relapses , level of disability, or personal characteristics such as age, sex, or ethnicity. o Absence of relapses while on tr eatment is a characteristic of t reatment effectiveness and should not be considered a justification for discontinuation of treatment. SAFETY SUMMARY Warnings for IFN include decreased peripheral blood cell count s including leukopenia, higher rates of depression, suicide and psychotic disorders , injection site reactions, and risk of severe hepatic injury. IFN (Avonex, Rebif, Betaseron, Extavia, and Plegridy) is with influenza- like symptoms including injection site reactions, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and headache. All IFN products carry a warning for thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocyt openic purpura and hemolytic ure mic syndrome. Adverse events related to IFN therapy appear to be dose-related and transient. Glatiramer acetate is contraindi cated in patients known hy persensitivity to glatiramer ac etate or mannitol. Patients treated with glatirame r acetate may experience a transient, self-limited, post-injection reac tion of flushing, chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, constriction of th e throat, and urticaria following injection. Injection site reactions incl uding lipodystrophy and skin necrosis have been reported. Because glatiramer acetate can modify immune response, it may int erfere with immune functions. In controlled studies of glati ramer acetate 20 mg/mL, the most common adverse reactions ( 10% and 1.5 times higher than placebo) were injection site reactions, vasodilatation, rash , dyspnea, and chest pain. In a controlled study of glatiramer acetate 40 mg/mL, the most common adverse reactions ( 10% and 1.5 times higher than placebo) w ere injection site reactions. Fingolimod was originally approved with a risk evaluation and m itigation strategies program (REMS) to inform healthcare providers about the serious risks including bradyarrhythmia, at rioventricular block, inf ections, macular od pressure, basal cell carc inoma, immune system effects following discontinuation, and hypersensitivity r eactions; howe ver, the FDA lifted the REMS requirements in November 2016. Posterior Reversible Enceph alopathy Syndrome (PRES) has b een reported with fingolimod. Patients with pre- existing cardiac disease may poorly tolerate fingolimod and may require additional monitoring. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence 10% and > placebo) were headache, liver transaminas e elevation, diarrhea, cough, influenza, sinusitis, back pain, abdominal pain, and pain in extremity. If a serious infection develops, consider suspending fingolimod and reassess risks and benefits prior to re-initiation. Elimination ma y take up to 2 months thus, monitoring for infections shoul d continue during this time. Do not start fingolimod in patients wi th active acute or chronic infection until the infection is resolved. Life-threatening and fatal infections have been reported in patients taking fingolimod. Establish immunity to v aricella zoster virus prior to therapy initiation. Recent safety labeling changes warn of an increased risk of cutaneous malignancies, including melanoma , in patients treated with fingolimod. Cases of PML 102 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 18 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A warning for PML has been adde d to the fingolimod labeling; at the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, fingolimod should be withheld and an appropriate diagn ostic evaluation performed. Mo nitoring for signs consistent with PML on MRI may be useful to allow for an early diagnosis. Additionally, severe increases in disability after disc ontinuation of fingolimod have been described in post marketing reports. Teriflunomide is contraindicat ed in patients with severe hepatic impairment; patients who are pregnant, of childbearing potential, or that are not using reliable contraception; and wi th concurrent use of leflunomide. Labeling includes boxed warnings regarding hepatotoxicit y and teratogenicity/embryolethality that occurred in animal reproduction studies in multiple animal species at plasma teriflunomide exposures simil ar to or lower than in human s. Other warnings include risk of leukopenia, peripheral neuropathy, severe skin reaction s, and elevated blood pressure. Teriflunomide has a half- life of 4 to 5 months; therefore, use of activated charcoal or cholestyramine in an 11-day r egimen upon discontinuation of teriflunomide is recommended to reduce serum levels over 2 w eeks. The most common adverse reactions ( 10% and 2% greater than placebo) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, and an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Dimethyl fumarate has no contraindications, except in with hypersensitivity to d imethyl fumarate or any excipients. Warnings include ana phylaxis and angioedema, PML, l ymphopenia, and clinically significant cases of liver injury reported in the post-market ing setting. Consider therapy interruption if severe lymphopenia for more than 6 months occurs. Cases of PML hav e been reported following dimeth yl fumarate therapy. Monitoring for signs consistent with PML on MRI may be useful to allow for an early diagnosis. Common adverse events (incidence 10% and 2% more than placebo) were flushing , abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. Administration of non -enteric aspirin up to 325 mg given 30 minutes prior to each dose or temporary dose reduct ion to 120 mg twice daily may reduce flushing. Natalizumab has a boxed warning regarding the risk of PML. PML is an opportunistic viral i nfection of the brain that usually leads to death or severe disability. Due to the risk of PML, natalizumab is only a vailable through the TOUCH\u00ae Prescribing Program which is a r estricted distribution program. Natalizumab is contraindicated in patients who have or have had PML and in pat ients who have had a hypersensitivity re action. The most common adverse reactions (incidence 10%) we re headache, fatigue, art hralgia, urinary t ract infection, lower res piratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, vaginitis, depression, pain in extremity, abdominal discomfort hypersensitivity reaction to natalizumab. Monitoring for signs consisten t with PML on MRI may be useful t o allow for an early diagnosi s. Other warnings with natalizumab include hypersensitivity reactions, increased risk of Herpes encephalitis and meningitis, acute retinal necrosis, increased ri sk of infections (including opportunistic infections), and hepatotoxicity, diarrhea (not otherwise specified), and rash. Mitoxantrone has boxed warnings for the risk of cardiotoxicity, risk of bone marrow suppression, and secondary leukemia. Congestive heart failure (CHF), potentially fatal, ma y occur either during therap y with mitoxantrone or months to years after termination of t herapy. The maximum cumulative lifetime dose of mitoxantrone for MS patients should not exceed 140 mg/kg/m2. Monitoring of cardiac function is required prior to all mitox antrone doses. Alemtuzumab is contraindicated in patients with human immunodef iciency virus (HIV). The boxed warning for alemtuzumab includes autoimmunity conditions (immune thrombocyt openia and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease), serious and life-threat ening infusion reactions, seri ous and life-threatening stroke within 3 days of administration, and the possibility of an increased risk of malignancies. Alemtuzumab is only available through a restricted distribution and REMS program which requires the mem ber, provider, pharmacy and infusion facility to be certified by the REMS program. A pproximately one-third of patie nts who receive alemtuzumab develop thyroid disorders. The most commonly reported adverse events reported i n at least 10% of alemtuz umab-treated patients and more frequently than with IFN-1a were rash, headache, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, nausea, urinary tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, upper respirat ory tract infection, herpes vi ral infection, urticaria, pruri tus, thyroid disorders, fungal infection, arthralgia, pain in extremity, back pain, diarrhea, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, paresthesia, dizziness, abdominal pain, flushing, and vomiting. Nearly all patients (99 .9%) in clinical trials had lymphopenia following a treatment course of alemtuzumab . Alemtuzumab may also increase the risk of acute acalculous cholecystitis; in controlled clinical studies, 0.2% of alemtuzumab-treated MS patients developed acute acalculous cholecystitis, compared to 0% of patients treated with IFN-1a. During postmar keting use, additional cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis have been report ed in alemtuzumab-treated patient s. Recent updates to the sa fety labeling include a warning that patients taking ale mtuzumab are at risk for seriou s infections caused by Listeria monocytogenes . Patients that are prescribed alemtuzumab should be counseled about this risk, and to avoid or appropriately heat any foods that may be a source of Listeria , such as deli meats and unpasteurized cheeses. Patients should undergo tuberculosis screening according to local guidelines. 103 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 19 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The labeling of ocrelizumab doe s not contain any boxed warnings ; however, ocrelizumab is contraindicated in patients with active hepatitis B virus ( HBV) infection and in those with a history of life-threateni ng infusion reactions to ocrelizumab. Additional warnings for ocrelizumab concern infusi on reactions, infections, and an increased risk of malignancies. o As of June 30, 2016, the overall incidence rate of first neoplasm among ocrelizumab-treat ed patients across all 3 pivotal studies and a Phase 2, dose-finding study (Kappos et al [2011]) was 0.40 per 100 patient-years of exposure to ocrelizumab (6467 patient-year s of exposure) vs 0.20 per 100 patient-years of exposure in the pooled comparator groups (2053 patient-years of ex posure in groups receiving Rebi f or placebo) (Hauser et al 2017, Ocrevus Formulary Submission Dossier 2017) . Since breast cancer occurred in 6 out of 781 females treated with ocrelizumab (vs in none of 668 females treated with Rebif or placebo), the labeling of ocrelizumab additionall y recommends that patient s follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines. In related postmarketing require ments, the FDA has asked the manufacturer to conduct a prospective, longitudinal, observational study in adult pat ients with RMS and PPMS exposed to ocrelizumab to determine the incidence and mortality rates of breast cance r and all malignancies. All patients enrolled in the study need to be followed for a minimum of 5 years or until death following their first exposur e to ocrelizumab and the protocol must specify 2 appropriate populations to which t he observed incidence and mor tality rates will be compared (FDA approval letter 2017) . o No cases of PML have been report ed to date in any studies of oc relizumab ( Hauser et al 2017, McGinley al 2017, Ocrevus Fo rmulary Submission Dossier 2017 ). o In patients with RMS, the most c ommon adverse reactions with oc relizumab (incidence 10% and greater than Rebif) were upper respiratory tr act infections and infusion rea ctions. In patients with PPMS, the most common adverse reactions (incidence 10% and greater than placebo) we re upper respiratory tract infections, infusion reactions, skin infections, and lower respiratory tract infecti ons. Dalfampridine is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure, moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl 50 mL/min), and a history of hypersensitivity to dalfampridine or 4-aminopyridine. Dalfampridi ne can cause anaphylaxis; signs and symptoms of anaphylaxi s have included respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and or tongue. Urinary tract infection s (UTIs) were reported more f requently as adverse reactions in controlled studies in patients receiving dalfampridine 10 mg twice daily (12%) as com pared to placebo (8%). The most common adverse events (incidence 2% and at a rate greater than the placebo r ate) for dalfampridine were UTI, insomnia, dizziness, headache, nausea, asthenia, back pain, balance disorder, MS relapse, 2C9*3/*3 genotype, presence of Mobitz type II second- degree, third degree atrioventricula r (AV) block or sinus syndr ome. It is also contraindicated in patients that have experienced myocardial infarcti on, unstable angina, stroke, tra nsient ischemic attack or d ecompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization in the past 6 months. Warnings and pr ecautions of siponimod include macular edema, increased blood pressure, brady arrhythmia and AV conduction del ays, decline in pulmonary function, and liver injury. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contracept ion during and for 10 days a fter stopping siponimod due to fetal risk. The most adverse events are headache, hypertensi on, and transaminase increases. Cladribine is contraindicated in patients with current malignancy, HIV infection, active chroni c infection such as hepatitis or tuberculosis, hypersensitivit y to cladribine, and in pregnan t women. There is a boxed warning for potential malignancy and risk of teratogenicity. The warn ings and precautions are lymphopenia, active infection, h ematologic toxicity, liver injury, and graft vs host disease with blood transfusion. The m ost common adverse events are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and lymphopenia. Table 3.

CONCLUSION DMTs for MS have shown benefits in patients with RRMS such as a decreased relapse rate and a slower accumulation of brain lesions on MRI. Theref ore, it is recommended that all patients with a diagnosis o f definite RRMS begin DMTs (MS Coalition 2017) . IFN products have been shown to decrease MRI lesion activity, prevent relapses, and delay disease progression. In general, patients treated with IF N or glatiramer acetate can e xpect a 30% reduction in ARR during a 2-year period (MS Coalition 2017) . Head-to-head clinical trials have found IFN and glatiramer a cetate to be compar able in terms of efficacy on relapse rate. Several studies have demonstrated an improved tolerability at the cost of a decreased therapeutic response with the lo w dose IM IFN-1a compared to the higher dose SC IFN-1a (Panitch et al 2002, Panitch et al 2005, Schwid et al 2005, Sc hwid et al 2007, Traboulsee et al 2008) . Influenza-type symptoms, injection site reactions, headache, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain are the m ost frequently reported adver se events with IFN products including Plegridy. Wit h IFN, use caution in patients with depression or other mood disorders. Peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks has demonstr ated efficacy in reducing the AR R in relapsing forms of MS compared to placebo. Potential advantages of Plegridy are less frequent administration every 2 weeks and possibly the reduced risk of NAb development. Adverse effect profile is similar among the IFNs. The most frequently rep orted adverse events with glatiramer ace tate include a transient, sel f-limiting, post-injection systemic reaction immediately following drug administration con sisting of flushing, chest pain, palpitations, anxiety, dyspnea, throat constri ction, and urticaria . Glatiramer acetate does not have any known drug interactions and is not associated with an in creased risk of hepat otoxicity or depressi on. Glatiramer acetate is generically available. Despite advancements in treatme nt, many patients fail initial D MTs with glatiramer acetate or IFN, primarily due to intolerable adverse effects or perceived inadequate efficacy (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . Clinical trials have shown that patients switching fr om IFN to glatiramer acetate therapy and vice versa, due to poor response, may achieve a significant reduction in relapse rates and a delay in disease and disability progression (Coyle 2008, Caon et al 2006, Zwibel 2006) . The guidelines suggest that all first-line MS DMTs should be made accessible, and the choice of initial treatment should be based on patient-specific factors (Corboy et al 2015, MS Coalit ion 2017, Scolding et al 2015, Montalban et al 2018) . Premature discontinuation rate is high among patients with MS ; therefore, fact ors that will maximize adherence should be co nsidered when initiating therapy . Failure with 1 agent does not necessarily predict failure to another. Therefore, patients experiencing an inadequ ate response or drug-induc ed adverse event should be switched to a different DMT (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . There are now 5 available oral a gents: Gilenya (fingolimod), wh ich was approved in 2010, A which was approved 2012, and Tecfidera ( dimethyl fumarate), which was approved in 2013. The 2 new agents are Mavenclad (cladribine) and Mayzent (siponi mod). Among other potential ben efits, it is expected that the availability of oral agents may increase convenience and impr ove patient adherence to their drug regimen (Sanvito et al 2011) . The available oral drugs each have different mechanisms of action and tolerability profiles. The oral products have not been compared to one another in any head-to-head tr ials. Cases of PML have been reported in patients taking to fingolimod, indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of M S, to include CIS, relapsing-r emitting disease, and active secondary progressive 112 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 28 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In a trial comparing Ma yzent to placebo, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of 3-month CDP, delayed the risk of 6-month CDP, and reduced the ARR ( Kappos et al 2018 ). First dose cardiac monitoring is recommended for patients with a heart rate < 55 bpm or a hist ory of cardiac dis ease. Siponimod shares many of the same warnings as fingolimod. Mavenclad (cladribine) is a puri ne antimetabolite indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to include relapsing-remitting disease and ac tive secondary progressive di sease. In a trial comparing Mavenclad to placebo, both Mavenclad 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/k g treatment groups had reduced ARRs and disability progression vs placebo (Giovannoni et al 2010 ). Lymphopenia is the mos t common adverse effect. Gilenya (fingolimod) is a sphing osine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. In a trial comparing fingolimod to placebo, fingolimod-treated patients had a decreased ARR, improved MRI outcomes, and a lower likelihood of disability progression (Kappos et al 2010) . In a trial comparing fingolim od to IFN-1a IM (Avonex), fingolimod-treated patients had a decreased AR R and improved MRI outco mes, but disability p rogression was similar in the 2 groups (Cohen et al, 2010) . The adverse event profile for fingolimod includes cardiovascu lar risks including bradycardia. First dose administration of fingolimod requi res at least 6 h ours of obser vation with hourly monito ring of heart rate and blood pressure, and patients should have an ECG before dosing and at the end of the obse rvation period. Fingolimod is also FDA-approved for MS in the pediatric population. In a trial evaluating patients between 10 and 17 years of age, fingolimod signific antly reduced ARR and the rate or new or newly enlarged lesions compared to IFN- 1a (Chitnis et al 2018 ). Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) efficacy similar to that of f ingolimod; its benefit-risk p rofile makes it a reasonable initial or later stage DMT opti on for most patients with RRMS (CADTH 2013, Wingerchuk et al 2014) . Gastrointestinal intolerance and flushing are co mmon side effects that may wane with time; slow titration to maintenance doses, taking the medication with food, and pr emedication with aspirin may re duce their novo pyrimidine synthesis. Although its exact m echanism of action is unknown, i t may involve a reduction in the number of activated lymphocytes in the CNS. Patients treated with teriflunomide in a clinical trial experience d a reduction in the ARR and improved MRI outcomes compared to placebo. Patients in the high er dose group (14 mg) also had a lower likelihood of disability progression, but this difference was not statistical ly significant in the lo wer dose group (7 mg) (O'Connor et al, 2011) . Teriflunomide has boxed warni ngs for the possibility of sever e liver injury and teratogenicity. The most common adverse reactions inc lude increases in ALT, alopecia, diarrhea, influenza, nausea, and paresthesia. Tysabri (natalizumab) has demonst rated very high efficacy vs placebo and although PM L is a major safety concern, the overall incidence of PML has remained low (0.4%). Natalizumab c an only be obtained through a restricted distribution program. Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is a highl y efficacious DMT that has dem onstrated superiority in reducing relapses when compared to Rebif in both treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experie nced patients. The dosing schedule of 2 annual treatment courses is counterbalanced by the need for regular mo nitoring of the increased risk for autoimmunity. Lemtrada is best reserved for pat ients who have failed at least 2 other DMTs and are not candidates for natalizumab (Garnock-Jones 2014). is a desi gned to selectively target CD20-positive As a humanized form of Rituxan (rituximab), ocrelizumab is expected to be less immunogenic wi th repeated infusions and may have a more favorable benefit -to-risk profile than Rituxan (Sorensen et al 2016) . o The approval of Ocrevus provides another DMT option to the grow ing armamentarium of highly effective agents indicated for the treatment of R MS. Ocrelizumab is also indicat ed for the treatment of PPMS , making it the first DMT with substantial evidence supporting its use in this form of MS . Although the pivotal studies of ocrelizumab were of sufficient length to assess effica cy, more long-term safety dat a are needed to evaluate the effects of ocrelizumab on emergent neoplasms and the risk of PML. Mitoxantrone is a synthetic inter calating chemotherapeutic agent. While it is approved for the treatment of RRMS, SPMS, and PRMS, cumulative dose-re lated cardiac toxicity and th e risk for secondary leukem ia markedly limit its use. Mitoxantrone is, therefore, reser ved for use in patients with a ggressive disease. While DMTs do not sufficiently address QOL in RRMS, symptomatic agents such as Ampyra (dalfampridine) can be used to complement tr eatment with DMTs. Although a 25% improvement in T25FW may appear marginal, it has been established that improvements in T25FW speed of 20% are meaningful to people with MS. Dalfampridine can complement DMTs, which do not address the specific symptom of w alking speed. Improved walking could potentially contain some of the direct and indirect costs (eg, reduced prod uctivity, disability, unempl oyment, costs of assistive devices and caregivers) associated with MS. 113 Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S/ALS/KR Page 29 of 33 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Therapeutic Class Overview Topical Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) INTRODUCTION Osteoarthritis (OA) is a key ar ea where topical formulations of nonsteroidal anti-inflammato ry drugs (NSAIDs) are used. OA, the most common form of arthr itis, causes signs and symptom s such as pain, tenderness, reduced range of motion, bony swelling, joint deformity, and instability. Symptoms typic ally appear in one or a few joints in a middle-aged or older person, and are often progressive ( Doherty et al 2017 ). The number of U.S. adults affected by OA has increased in the l ast several decades due to aging of the population and the increasing prevalence of obesity. Approximately 30 million U.S. adults are affected by O A, up from 21 million in 1995 (Centers for Disease Control and Pr evention 2017, Suri et al 2012 ). Oral NSAIDs are effective for t he treatment of moderate to seve re pain, but are associated with an increased risk of several gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular adverse events . The NSAID products as a class, including topical products, carry a Boxed Warning regarding the risk of cardiovascular and GI adverse events associated with their use. However, the use of topical NSAIDs applied directly to the affected area reduces overall systemic absorption and minimizes the risk of severe adverse events ( Galer 2011). The adverse events associated with the topical NSAIDs are typically dermatologic in natur e and are self-limiting in most cases. Solaraze (diclofenac sodium gel ) lesion, usually found on sun-exposed areas such as th e head, neck, forearms, and hands in older, fair- skinned patients. Actinic keratos is is considered a potential p remalignant lesion that may progress to squamous cell carcinoma. For patients with a single lesion, a few low-risk le sions, or thin lesions, treatm ent with cryotherapy, topical 5- fluorouracil, imiquimod, diclofenac, or ingenol mebutate considered ( al 2017, Shoimer et Diclofenac is the only NSAID comm ercially available in topical formulations. There are currently 3 formulations available, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications var y among products. The following products are included within this review: Flector (diclofenac epolamine patch, 1.3%) is indicated for the topical treatment of acute pain due to minor strains, sprains, and contusions. Flector is composed of an adhesive mat erial containing 1.3% diclofenac epolamine applied to a polyester felt backing. Licart (diclofenac epolamine topical system, 1.3%), which share s the same indication as Fle ctor, is a topical system comprised of an adhesive material containing 1.3% diclofenac epolamine which is applied to a non-woven polyester felt backing and covered with a polypropylene film release line r. Licart differs from Flect or in that it is applied once daily, while Flector is applied twice daily. Pennsaid (diclofenac sodium topical solution, 1.5%) is indicate d for the treatment of signs and symptoms of OA of the knee(s); and higher strength Pennsaid (diclofenac sodium topica l solution, 2%) is indicated for the treatment of pain of OA of the knees. Pennsaid contains diclofenac sodium as well as the penetration and topi cal gel, 3%) is indicated for t he topical treatment of actin ic keratoses. In addition to sun avoidance measures, diclofen ac sodium topical gel (3%) is e ffective for lesions of the scalp, forehead, face, arm, forearm, and back of the hand. Sol araze provides diclofenac sod ium in a gel base including benzyl alcohol, hyaluronate sodium, and other inactive ingredients. Voltaren (diclofenac sodium topi cal gel, 1%) is indicated for t he relief of pain of OA of joints amenable to topical treatment, such as the knees and those of the hands. Voltaren p rovides diclofenac sodium in a white gel base.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Two studies evaluated the use o f diclofenac patch vs placebo patch in patients with acute injuries. Patients who had experienced a sp orts-related sprain, strain, o r contusion experienced a st atistically significantly improvement in scores for pain and functioning following application of the diclofenac epol amine patch over 14 days (p = 0.036 and p = 0.048, respectively) ( Galer et al 2000 ). Patients with a minor soft tissue injury exper ienced an 18.2% reduction in visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores following twice-daily application of the diclofenac epolamine p atch over 14 days (p = 0.002) ( Kuehl et al 2011 ). The efficacy and safety of dicl ofenac gel have been evaluated i n patients with OA of the hand s and knees in an 8-week study. Study results demonstrated greater pain relief, Australi an/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN) score improvement, and global rating o f disease with diclofenac sodium gel compared to placebo in patients with OA of the hand ( Altman et al 2009 ). In patients with OA of the k nee, treatment with diclofenac gel for 12 weeks led to greater 120 Data as of March 22, 2019 DKB/LMR Page 3 of 7 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Additionally, a 12-month, open-label study in patients with OA of the knee dem onstrated sustained long-term i mprovement compared to baseline for WOMAC pain scores, stiffness, and physical function ( Peniston et al 2011). In a study by Simon et al, pat ients with OA of the knee treated with topical diclofenac sodium 1.5% solution achieved statistically significant reductions in pain scores compared to patients treated with placebo (-6 vs -4.7; p = 0.015) and dimethyl sulfoxide alone (-6 vs - 4.7; p = 0.009). There was no statistically significant diffe rence in pain scores compared to patients receiving diclofenac tablets (-6 vs -7; p = 0.429) (Simon et al 2009 ). The safety and efficacy of diclofenac 2% solution were evaluate d in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 4-week clinic al trial in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee (N = 260 ). A reduction of 4.5 in the WOMAC pain score was noted in the diclofenac 2% group as compar ed to a 3.6 reduction in the placebo vehicle group (p = 0.04) (Wadsworth et al 2016 ). The safety and efficacy of diclofenac epolamine topical system 1.3% (Licart) was based on 2 placebo- and active- controlled studies in patients with minor sprains, strains, and /or contusions. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, or Flector (diclofenac epolamine patch 1.3%) once dail y for 7 or 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in pain on movement to day 3 of treatment. In both studies, Licart demonstrated a statistically significant diffe rence vs placebo for the reducti on in pain on movement at day 3. Conclusions regarding comparative efficacy of Licart vs Flector cannot be made becaus e Flector was not administered according to its approved twice daily dosing regimen ( Licart prescribing information 2018 ). The clinical effectiveness of the gel and solution formulations has not been compared in any head-to-head trials. However, a single-dose patient preference trial in 24 healthy volunteers demonstrated a pr eference for the solution formulation on several characteristics, including odor/smell, o iliness/greasiness, and stickiness/tackiness ( Galer et al 2011 ). A systematic review of 19 trials summarized the benefits of diclofenac solution, gel, and patch based on clinical studies comparing the topical diclofenac products to placebo or oral NS AIDs. Key reported outcomes included: Superiority of diclofenac patch and gel over placebo for the tr eatment of acute pain due to b lunt impact injuries or ankle sprains Superiority of diclofenac gel and solution over placebo for pain due to OA of the knee Superiority of diclofenac gel over placebo for pain relief due to epicondylitis and periart hritis, and superiority of diclofenac patch over placebo for epicondylitis Similar efficacy of diclofenac gel and/or diclofenac liquid wit h DMSO compared to oral NSAIDS for several outcomes including pain relief due to O A of the hand and knee and acute musculoskeletal injury ( Zacher et al 2008 ) A recent meta-analysis of 9 rand omized trials evaluated topical diclofenac therapy (patch, solution, or gel) compared to placebo or vehicle for the treat ment of OA. The combined data d emonstrated significantly improved pain scores with topical diclofenac compared to t he control group (standard mean difference, 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.62; p = 0.0003). The data also suggested an improvement in fu nction scores, but further studies on this endpoint would be required to confirm the results ( Deng et al 2016 ). In a Cochrane review, data from an analysis of 39 double-blind, randomized controlled trials comparing topical NSAIDs to placebo, oral NSAIDs, or other topical treatments demonstrat ed a small benefit of topica l NSAIDs compared to a placebo vehicle in patients with chronic musculoskeletal condit ions. Treatment success was ac hieved in 60% of patients treated with topical diclofenac v s 50% of patients treated with a placebo vehicle. The analysis also demonstrated similar efficacy with topical NSAIDs and oral NSAIDs, with treatment su ccess in in 55% and 54% of patients, respectively (Derry et al 2016 ). Another Cochrane review focused on the use of topical NSAIDs fo r acute musculoskeletal pain, including sprains, strains, contusions, tendinitis, and acute low back pain. A tot al of 61 double-blind, randomized controlled trials comparing topical NSAIDs to topi cal placebo or an oral NSAID we re included. Overall, topical NSAID formulations provided good levels of pain relief in acute conditions. The ma jority of the recent data is for topical diclofenac, and this recent data is of higher quality than earlier data. Based on 10 studies, 74% of patients treated with topical diclofenac experienced a successful treatme nt outcome, compared to 47% wit h placebo (relative risk [RR ], 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5 to 1.7). Data was not sufficient to compa re the efficacy of different topical NSAIDs or of oral vs topi cal formulations of the same NSAID. 121 Data as of March 22, 2019 DKB/LMR Page 4 of 7 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Topical NSAIDs were not associat ed with an increase in local or systemic adverse events compared to topical placebo. There were fewer system ic adverse events with topical vs oral treatment; however, this was based on limited data ( Derry et al 2015 ). The clinical effectiveness of diclofenac sodium topical gel (3%) was evaluated in 427 patient s, of whom 213 were treated with diclofenac sodium topical gel (3%) and had actinic keratos is lesions. In trials, significa ntly more patients treated with diclofenac sodium topical gel (3%) had complete clearing of les ions on the scalp (36% vs 13 %; p = 0.09), forehead (39% vs 19%; p = 0.001), and face (47% v s 20%; p = 0.002) vs a vehicle alone. However, results were not significantly different for application to the arm/forearm (p = 0.20) or the back of hand (p = 0.36). Overall rates of clearing ranged from 18 to 47% in trials ( Solaraze prescribing information 2016). One Cochrane review evaluated t opical, oral, mechanical, and ch emical interventions (totaling 24 different treatments) for actinic keratosis across 83 RCTs with 10,036 patients. A total of 60 trials evaluated 18 topical creams or gels. In those trials that evaluated topi cal diclofenac sodium 3% gel co mpared to a vehicle, diclofenac was associated with a significant improvement in comp lete clearance of lesions (32% v s 13%; RR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.66 to 3.66) in 3 studies with 420 patients. There was also a si gnificant increase in number o f patients who withdrew from t rials due to adverse events (RR, 3.59; 95% CI, 1.92 to 6.70) in 4 trials with 592 patients (Gupta et al 2012 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES According to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2012 re commendations for the use of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies in OA of the hand, hip, and knee (u pdated guidelines are due to be published later in 2019): For the initial management of OA pain of the hand, topical caps aicin, oral or topical NSAIDs, or tramadol may be used. In patients > 75 years of age, topical NSAIDs are preferr ed over oral formulations. For the initial management of OA pain of the knee, acetaminophe n, NSAIDs (oral or topical), tramadol, or intraarticular cortico steroid injections may be used. In patien ts > 75 years of age, topical NSAIDs are preferred over oral formulations. No one topical NSAID product is recommended over another within the guidelines ( Hochberg et al 2012 ). According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2013 Guidelines for th e treatment of OA of the knee: Acupuncture, lateral wedge insoles, and glucosamine and chondro itin are not recommended. NSAIDs (oral or topical) or tramadol are recommended. There is inconclusive evidence to recommend either for or again st the use of acetaminophen, opioids, pain patches, or intraarticular corticosteroids. No one topical NSAID product is recommended over another within the guidelines ( AAOS 2013 ). According to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2014 guidelines for the non-surgical management of knee OA: Appropriate treatments vary based on patient-specific comorbidities and whether patients have knee-only OA or multi-joint OA. Topical NSAIDs are recommended as appropriate in patients with knee-only OA, but their use in patients with multi- joint OA is uncertain and will depend on an assessment of indiv idual patients' risks and benefits. No one topical NSAID product is recommended over another within the guidelines ( McAlindon et al 2014 ). According to the Veterans Affairs (VA)/Department of Defense (D OD) clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip and knee OA: In patients with no co ntraindications to pharmacologic therapy, clinicians should consider acetaminophen or oral NSAIDs as first-line treatment. The recommendation to use topical NSAID therapy as an alternati ve to oral NSAIDs is supported by evidence from studies that have compared vario us topical and oral NSAIDs in p atients with knee OA. The re sults have consistently shown that the topical and oral formulations of any given NSAID are similar in terms of improvement in pain and function in patients with knee OA. For topical NSAIDs collectivel y, the reduction in the incidence of GI events has been shown to be 36% relative to the oral formulations. However, there is insufficient evidence to compare topical and oral NSAIDs in terms of serious GI adverse events (perforation, ulcers or bleeding). The decision to use a topical N SAID (vs oral NSAID with or with out proton pump inhibitor) should be based on consideration of patient prefere nce, adverse event potential (including GI adverse events) , and resource utilization. 122 Data as of March 22, 2019 DKB/LMR Page 5 of 7 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. No studies have directly compar ed the solution and gel formulat ions in patients with OA ( VA/DOD 2014 ). The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) guidelines for the management of actinic keratoses recommend the following: Treatment needs to address a wid e range of variables including the nature of the actinic keratosis, the body site, patient preference, the premorbi d state of the patient and prev ious treatments tried. For mild actinic ker atosis, treatment options include no treatm ent or emollient only. Depending on severity, location , and other factors, topical and oral treatment options include 5-fluorouracil (strength of recommendation A), imiquimod (strength of recommendation A), diclofenac gel (strength of recommendation A), ingenol mebutate (strength of rec ommendation A), topical retino ids (strength of recommen dation B), and systemic therapies (strength of recommendation C). Overall, data with diclofenac gel indicate moderate efficacy wi th low morbidity in mild actinic keratoses. Treatment was well tolerated and reported adv erse effects were mainly pru ritus (41% estimated a fter 30 days' treatment) and rash (40% estimated after 60 days) ( de Berker et al 2017). SAFETY SUMMARY solution, Flector, Licart, Pennsaid, and a boxed warning for: Cardiovascular thrombotic events NSAIDs cause an increased risk o f serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. T hese events were also observed in the first 10 to 14 days following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery via 2 large clinical trials. All ag ents are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. This risk may occur early in treat ment and may increase with duration of use. GI risk NSAIDs cause an increased risk o f serious GI adverse events, in cluding bleeding, ulceration , and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These reactions can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and pat ients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events. Despite low systemic blood leve ls relative to oral NSAIDs, the topical NSAIDs carry a number of warnings and precautions related to potential systemic events, including: Anaphylactic reactions Exacerbation of asthma related to aspirin sensitivity Heart failure and edema; avoid use in patients with severe hear t failure Hematologic toxicity Hepatotoxicity Hypertension Premature closure of fetal ductu s arteriosus; avoid use in preg nant women starting at 30 weeks gestation Renal toxicity and hyperkalemia ; avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease Serious skin reactions The most common adverse reactions for the topical NSAIDs are ap plication site reactions, such as dermatitis, pruritus, burning, dryness, and erythema. Warnings specific to the topical administration of NSAID produc ts include the following: The potential exists for a small child or pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a Flector patch or Licart topical system. Even a used Flector patch or Licart t opical system contains a lar ge amount of diclofenac. It is important for patients to store a nd dispose of the patch or top ical system out of the reach of children and pets. Avoid contact of diclofenac with eyes and mucosa. Avoid exposure to natural or ar tificial sunlight on treated are as because studies in animals i ndicated topical diclofenac treatment resulted in earlier onset of ultraviolet light-induce d skin tumors.

Complete healing or optimal therapeutic effect may not be evident for up to 30 days following the cessation of therapy. Therapy may be interrupted for severe dermal reactions until the condition subsides. Flector (diclofenac epolamine) 1.3% patch Topical Twice daily Should not be applied to non-intact or damaged skin; should not be worn while bathing or showering Licart (diclofenac epolamine) 1.3% topical system Topical Once daily Do not apply Licart to nonintact or damaged skin resulting from any etiology (eg, exudative dermatitis, eczema, infected lesion, burns or wounds). Do not wear when bathing or showering. Pennsaid (diclofenac sodium) 2% solution Topical Twice daily Apply to clean, dry skin; do not apply heat or occlusive dressings Voltaren (diclofenac sodium) 1% gel Topical Four times daily Use enclosed dosing card to measure dose Apply to clean, dry, intact skin; do not apply heat or occlusive dressings See the current prescribing info rmation for full details. Note: The lowest effective dosage of t opical product should be used for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. CONCLUSION NSAIDs are commonly used for t he treatment of pain due to OA, a ctinic keratosis, or minor strains, sprains, and contusions. The topical applicat ion of NSAIDs may reduce the ri sk of severe adverse events associated with oral NSAID use. Diclofenac is currently t he only NSAID available in topical formulations. Flector and Licart are available as 1.3% topical patch and topi cal system, respectively. These products are indicated for acute pain due to minor strains , sprains, and contusions. Penns aid is available as a 1.5% topical solution and is indicated for the treatment of s igns and symptoms of OA of the knee(s). A higher strength fo rmulation of Pennsaid (2%) has also been made available; it is indicated for the treatment of pain of OA of the knees. V oltaren is available as a 1% topical gel and is indicated for the relief of pain of OA of jo ints amenable to topical treatment, such as the knees and those of the hands. A higher stre ngth formulation of Solaraze ( 3%) has also been made available; it is indicated for the treatment of actinic keratoses. O f 3% an d Pennsaid 1.5% solution are no longer marketed. The topical products carry many of the same warnings as their respective orally-administe red products; however, systemic absorption is genera lly low, and the most frequent adv erse events are administration site reactions. 124 Data as of March 22, 2019 DKB/LMR Page 7 of 7 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Therapeutic Class Overview Anticonvulsants INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a disease of the brai n defined by any of the follow ing (Fisher et al 2014 ): At least 2 unprovoked (or reflex ) seizures occurring > 24 hours apart; 1 unprovoked (or ref lex) seizure and a probability of further s eizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after 2 unprovoked seizures , occurring over the next 10 ye ars; Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Types of seizures include generali zed seizures, focal (partial) seizures, and status epilepticus ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2018, Epilepsy Foundation 2016 ). Generalized seizures affect both sides of the brain and include : Tonic-clonic (grand mal): begin with stiffening of the limbs, f ollowed by jerking of the limbs and face Myoclonic: characterized by r apid, brief contractions of body m uscles, usually on both sides of the body at the same time Atonic: characterized by abrupt l oss of muscle tone; they are a lso called drop attacks or akinetic seizures and can result in injury due to falls Absence (petit mal): character ized by brief lapses of awareness , sometimes with staring, that begin and end abruptly; they are more common in children than adults and may be accompanied by brief myoclonic jerking of the eyelids or facial muscles, a loss of muscle tone, or automa tisms. Focal seizures are located in ju st 1 area of the brain and incl ude: Simple: affect a small part of t he brain; can affect movement, sensations, and emotion, without a loss of consciousness Complex: affect a larger area o f the brain than simple focal se izures and the patient loses awareness; episodes typically begin with a blank sta re, followed by chewing movemen ts, picking at or fumbling with clothing, mumbling, and performing repeat ed unorganized movements or wand ering; they may also be called \"temporal lobe epilepsy\" or \"psychomotor epilepsy\" Secondarily generalized seizures : begin in 1 part of the brain and spread to both sides Status epilepticus is characterized by pro longed, uninterrupted seizure activity. Seizure classifications from the International League against E pilepsy (ILAE) were updated in 2017. The ILAE classification of seizure types is based on whether the seizure has a focal, generalized, or unknown onset; has a motor or non-motor onset; and whether the patient is aware or has imp aired awareness during the event (for focal seizures). Additional classification de tails may also be used ( Fisher et al 2017A, Fisher et al 2017B ). There is variation between the IL AE classifications and many of the Food and Drug Administ ration (FDA)-approved indications for antiepileptic d rugs (AEDs). For e xample, a \"foc al aware\" seizure corresponds to the prior term \"simple partial seizure,\" and a \"focal i mpaired awareness \" seizure corr esponds to the prior term \" complex partial seizure.\" A number of epilepsy syndromes hav e also been described; these are defined by groups of f eatures that tend to occur together such as having a simila r seizure type, age of onset, p art of the brain involved, and electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern ( Epilepsy Foundation 2013). An example is a childhood epi lepsy syndrome called Lennox-Ga staut syndrome (LGS), which is charac terized by several seizure types including tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. In LGS, there is a classic EEG pattern seen and intellectual de velopment is usually impaired ( Epilepsy Foundation 2014 ). Epilepsy management is focused on the goals of 1) controlling s eizures, 2) avoiding treatme nt-related adverse effects (AEs), and 3) maintaining or r estoring quality of life. Managem ent options vary based on the seizure type. It is usually appropriate to refer patients to a neurologist to establish the epilepsy diagnosis and formulate the management strategy (Schachter 2018 ). A correct diagnosis is essential to proper treatment selection. For example, absence seizures are commonly confused with complex partial seizures. H owever, drugs that reduce absen ce seizures are generally ineffective for complex partial seizures, and the most e ffective drugs for complex part ial seizures may be ineffect ive against or even increase the frequency of absence seizures (Epilepsy Foundation 2016). When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred t reatment approach. Combination therapy may be associated with decreased pati ent adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions.

There is little compar ative clinical data to support the use of specific combinations ( Schachter et al 2018 ). Several broad classes of AEDs ar e available, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, hydantoins, and miscellaneous agents (see Table 1). Cannibidiol (Epidiolex) was FDA- approved in June 2018 for use i n pediatric patient s 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018 ). It is the first FDA-approved d rug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and is the first approved drug that contains a purifie d substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. Cannabidiol is a V controlled substance ( Epidiolex prescribing information). Stiripentol (Diacomit) capsules and powder for oral suspension were FDA-approved in August 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet s yndrome in pati ents 2 years of age and older taking clobazam. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) recei ved an expanded indication in A pril 2018 for use in partial- onset seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) . This product is a kinase inh ibitor that also has several oncology indications. Several of the AEDs are used fo r additional indications beyond the management of epilepsy, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and several types o f neuropathic pain. These additi onal indications are listed in Table 2; however, this review primarily focuses on the use o f AEDs for the management of epilepsy. Additionally, brands and formulations FDA-appr oved and marketed only for non- epilepsy indications are not included within this review; these include gabapentin t ablets (Gralise), FDA-approve extended-relea of postherpetic neuralgia and treatment of moderate-to-sever e restless leg syndrome, and pregabalin extended-release tablets (Lyrica CR), FDA- approved only for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral bar biturate hypnotics Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Overall, the anticonvulsants hav e demonstrated efficacy for the ir FDA-approved uses. Clinic al trial data demonstrating efficacy of the anticonvulsants fo r the treatment of epilepsy is described in the prescribing in formation for the individual products, particularly for anti convulsants more recently approv ed by the FDA. However, the pr escribing information for some older, products (eg, phenobarbital) do not contain efficacy data in their prescribing information. No single AED is clearly the mo st effective. Comparative effica cy data for the management of epilepsy are limited, and trials have generally not shown significant differences among d rugs in terms of efficacy. H owever, the quality of the data is limited and generally derived from short-term trials ( Karceski 2018 ). When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred t reatment approach. Combination therapy may be associated with decreased pati ent adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. (Schachter et al 2018 ). Most patients with epilepsy are treated with anticonvulsant monotherapy ( Nevitt et al 2017 ). An evidence review summarized AED efficacy and effectiveness as initial monotherapy for epileptic seizures and syndromes (Glauser et al 2013 ). This publication provides con clusions based on a review of 6 4 randomized trials and 11 meta-analyses. Conclusions include the following: As initial monotherapy for adults poten tially efficacious/effective. As initial monotherapy for children with newly diagnosed or un treated partial-onset As initial monotherapy for elder ly adults with newly diagnosed or untreated partial-onset seizures: Gabapentin and lamotrigine entially efficacious/effective. As initial for adults aggravate genera lized-onset tonic-clonic seizures. For children with newly diagnose t tonic-clonic seizures: genera lized-onset tonic-clonic seizures. As initial monotherapy for child ren with newly diagnosed or unt reated absence seizures: Ethosuximide and valproate are established as efficacious/effec tive. Lamotrigine is possibly e fficacious/effective. 134 Data as of February 14, 2019 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 10 of 25 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, tiagabi ne, and vigabatrin ma y precipitate or aggravate absence seizures (based on scattered reports). As initial monotherapy for children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes Carbamazepine (not ailable in the United St ates) are potentially efficacious/effective. For patients with newly diagnosed myoclonic, and in some c ases generalized tonic-clonic seizures. There has also been a report that lamotrigine may exacerbate seizures in JME. There is a lack of well-designed randomized trials in epilepsy, particularly for generalized seizures and in the pediatric population. A Cochrane systematic review evaluated the efficacy of AED monotherapy for epilepsy ( Nevitt et al 2017 ). treatment of partial onset seizures (simpl e partial, complex partial or secondarily generalized) or genera lized tonic-clonic seizures w ith or without other gener alized seizure types. This network meta-analysis show ed that for the primary outcome, the time to withdrawal o f allocated treatment: For individuals with partial sei zures, levetiracetam performed better than carbamazepine and lamotrigine; lamotrigine performed better t han all other treatments (aside f rom levetiracetam); and carbamazepine performed better than gabapentin and phenobarbital. For individuals with generalized onset seizures, v alproate perf ormed better than carbamazepine, topiramate and phenobarbital. For both partial and generalized onset seizures, phenobarbital seems to perform worse than all other treatments. For the secondary outcome , time to first seizure: For individuals with partial seizures, phenobarbital performed better than both carbamazepine and lamotrigine; carbamazepine performed better t han valproate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine; and phenytoin performed better than lamotrigine. For both partial and generalized seizure types, phenytoin and p henobarbital generally performed better than other treatments. Few notable differences were show n for either partial or genera lized seizure types for the secondary outcomes of time to 6-month or 12-month remission of seizures. Overall, direct evidence and netwo rk meta-analysis estimates were numerically similar, and effect sizes had overlapping confidence intervals. Data for individuals with general ized seizures are still limite d and additional randomized trials are needed. The generalized (n = 7 studies ) or absence seizures (n = 3 studies) was evaluated in a systematic review and network meta-analysis (Campos et al 2018 ). The outcomes analyzed were seizure freedom and withdrawal due to inefficacy. Compared to valproate, phenytoin had a lower odds of seizure freedom (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% credible Interval [CrI] 0.27 to gene ralized tonic-clonic seizures . Lamotrigine had the highest probability of seizure freedom and valproate had the highest pr obability of withdrawal due to inefficacy in these patients. For absence seizures, ethosuximid e and valproate were found to have a higher probability of seizure freedom compared to lamotrigine. A meta-analysis estimated the co mparative efficacy of achieving seizure freedom with 22 antiepileptic drugs and placebo in children and adolescents ( Rosati et al 2018 ). For the treatment of newly di agnosed focal epilepsy (n = 4 studies), point estimates suggest ed superiority of carbamazepin e and lamotrigine; however, th is was not statistically significant. For refractory foca l epilepsy (n = 9 studies), lev etiracetam and perampanel were more effective than placebo in mixed comparisons. Ethosuximid e and valproic acid were more effective than lamotrigine for absence seizures. The authors concluded that better designed comparative studies with appropriate lengt h of follow-up, well-defined outcomes, and reliable inclusion criteria a re needed to validate these re sults. 135 Data as of February 14, 2019 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 11 of 25 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Approximately 20% to 40% of patients with epilepsy can be consi dered refractory to drug treat ment, referred to as drug- resistant epilepsy. Treatment o f drug-resistant epilepsy may in clude additional anticonvulsant drug trials, epilepsy surgery, vagal nerve stimulation , and dietary changes (the keto genic diet) ( Sirven 2018 ). Combination AED regimens are an option for the treatment of dru g-resistant epilepsy. However, robust clinical evidence of suitable combinatio ns of AEDs has been difficult to generate due to the large number of possible combinations of drugs and doses. Examples of combinations for which there is some evidence of efficacy include valproate plus lamotrigine for partial-onset and generalized seizures, valproate plus ethosuximide for absence seizures, and lamotrigine plus t opiramate for various seizure t ypes; however, even this evi dence is fairly limited. In general, when considering combination therapy, it is recommende d to combine medications with different mechanisms of action, and to be mindful of the overall drug load to minimize AEs. Two-drug therapy should be attempted before considering addition of a third drug, and high er numbers of drugs shoul d be avoided as they are associated with a very low lik elihood of additional seizure red uction ( Kwan et al 2011 ). A as adjuncti ve therapy for uncontrolled par tial-onset seizures. Most patients in this meta-analysis were on at least 2 other AED s at the time of treatment. In this analysis, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, and brivaracetam were non-inferior to levetiracetam in terms of eff icacy, but all newer AEDs except brivaracetam had worse tolerability pr ofiles than levetirace tam at high doses ( Zhu et al 2017 ). A network meta-analysis examined t he parti while using monotherapy ( Zhao et al 2017 ). The efficacy outcomes studied were 50% responder rate and st ate of seizure freedom. The authors co ncluded that topiramate, levetiracetam, pregabalin, and oxcarbazepi ne were preferable for their relatively high efficacy and low risk of AEs. Rufinamide was the least preferable medication due to its low efficacy and high risk of AEs. A network meta-analysis was conduc ted to evaluate the efficacy of 17 newer AEDs for treatm ent of refractory partial- onset epilepsy with or with out secondary generalization ( Hu et al 2018 ). The primary outcome was seizure freedom, which was defined as a 100% seizure reduction in the maintenanc e or double-blind treatmen t period of the trial. Safety was assessed by the wit hdrawal rate due to treatment-eme rgent AEs. Based on resu lts of 54 studies that evaluated the efficacy outcome , the most effective agents inclu ded tiagabine, brivaracetam, and valproic acid, and the least effective agents included ru finamide, lamotrigine, and zonisamide. Products with favorable safety included levetiracetam, brivaracetam, and perampanel, while those with the least favorable safety included retigabine, oxcarbazepine, and rufinamide. T he authors stated that agents w ith the best outcomes in terms of efficacy and safety included levetiracetam, vigabatrin, valproic acid, and brivarac etam. Cannibidiol (Epidiolex) in June 2018 for use in pe diatric patients 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018 ). It is the first FDA-approved drug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and is the first approved drug that contains a purifie d substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. Its approval for these 2 indications w as based on 3 placebo-control led trials in patients refr actory to other treatments. Epidiolex, along with use of ot her agents, demonstrated a signi ficant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( Thiele et al 2018 ; Devinsky et al 2018; Devinsky et al 2017). To date, no comp arative trials have been published. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) recei ved an expanded indication fo r adjunctive use in TSC- associated partial-on set seizures in April 2018. Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 366 patients with inadequately cont rolled seizures on 2 or more AEDs demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( French et al 2016 ). In August 2018, the FDA approved a second drug, stiripentol (Di acomit), for use in the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Two multicenter placebo-contro lled studies evaluated the addition of stiripentol to clobazam and valproate therapy i n patients 3 years to less than 18 years of age with Dr avet syndrome. Responder rates (seizure frequency reduced by 50%) with respect to genera lized tonic-clonic seizures were significantly lower with stiripentol compared to placebo ( Diacomit prescribing information 2018).

A 2018 update to the 2004 guideline focuses on treatment of new -onset epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs. The 2004 publication summ arizes the efficacy, acetam, and zonisamide for the treatment of children and adults with newly diagnosed partial and ge neralized epilepsies. The recommendations from the 2004 gu ideline include the following: Patients with newly diagnosed ep ilepsy who require treatment can be initially treated with standard AEDs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate. Choice will depend on individual patient characteristics. Lamotrigine can be included in the options for children with ne wly diagnosed absence seizures. The 2018 recommendations include the following : As monotherapy in adult patients with new-onset focal epilepsy or unclassified generalized tonic-clonic seizures: Lamotrigine use be consid ered Lamotrigine use should be consid ered and gabapentin use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency in patients aged 60 years. Levetiracetam and zonisamide use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Vigabatrin appears to be less efficacious than carbamazepine i mmediate-release and ma y not be offered; furthermore, the toxicity profile precludes vigabatrin use as first-line therapy. Pregabalin 150 mg per day is possibly less efficacious than lamotrigine 100 mg per day. There is insufficient evidence to consider use of gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate over carbamazepine. There is insufficient evidence to consider use of topiramate i nstead of phenytoin in ur gent treatment of new- onset or recurrent foca l epilepsy, unclassif ied generalized ton ic-clonic seizures, or generalized epilepsy presenting with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Data are lacking to support or refute use epilepsy. Data are lacking to support or r efute use of newer AEDs in treating unclassified generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide or valproic acid s hould be considered before lamot rigine to decrease seizure frequency in children with absence epilepsy . An exception would be if there are compelling AE-related concerns with use of ethosuximide or valproic acid. The guideline does not address newly approved agents including cannabidiol, everolimus, or stiripentol. Efficacy and tolerability of the drugs II: tr eatment of refractory epilepsy . American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Kanner et al 2018B , French et al 2004B ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guidelin e focuses on management of tr eatment-resistant epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs. The 2004 publicat ion summarizes the efficacy, and adults with refractory partial and gen eralized epilepsies. Recommendations from the 2004 guideline include the following: It is appropriate to use gabapent in, piramate, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine herapy in patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Topiramate may be used for the treatment of refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and children. Gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbaz epine, and topiramate may be u sed as adjunctive treatment of children with refractory partial seizures. Topiramate and lamotrigine may be used to treat drop attacks as sociated with LGS in adults and children. Recommendations from the 2018 guideline include the following: As adjunctive therapy in patient s with treatment-resistant adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE): Immediate-release pregabalin and perampanel are established as effective to seizure frequency. Lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended-release topiramate s hould be considered to decrease seizure frequency. 137 Data as of February 14, 2019 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 13 of 25 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Vigabatrin and rufinamide are e ffective for decreasing seizure frequency, but are not first-line agents. Ezogabine (no longer marketed) u se should be considered to reduce seizure frequency, but carries a serious risk of skin and retinal discoloration. Clobazam and extended-release o xcarbazepine may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. As monotherapy in patients with TRAFE: Eslicarbazepine use may be cons idered to decrease seizure freq uency. Data are insufficient to recommend use of second- and the othe r third-generation AEDs. For add-on therapy for generalized epilepsy, immediate-release and extended-release lamotrigine should be considered as add-on therapy to decrease seizure frequency in a dults with treatment-resistant generalized tonic-clonic seizures secondary to generalized epilepsy. Leveti racetam use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency as add-on ther apy for treatment-resistant gen eralized tonic-clonic seizures and for treatment-resistant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Rufinamide is effective to reduce seizure frequency as add-on t herapy for LGS. Clobazam use should be considered as add-on therapy for LGS. For add-on therapy in pediatric patients with treatment-resista nt focal epilepsy: Levetiracetam use should be cons idered to decrease seizure fre quency (ages 1 mont h to 16 years). Zonisamide use should be considered to decrease seizure freque ncy (age 6 to 17 years). Oxcarbazepine use should be cons idered to decrease seizure fre quency (age 1 month to 4 years). Data are unavailable on the effi cacy vigabatrin. The does not approved agents including cannabidiol, everolimus, or stiripentol. Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first sei zure in adults. Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Ameri can Epilepsy Society ( Krumholz et al 2015; reaffirmed in 2018 ). This practice guideline makes re commendations based on a consid eration of the eviden ce for prognosis and treatment of adults with an unprovoked first seizure. Recommendations include the following: Adults presenting with an unpr ovoked first seizure should be in formed that the chance for a recurrent seizure is greatest within the first 2 years after a first seizure (21% to 45%). Clinicians should also advise su ch patients that clinical facto rs associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence include a prior brain insult such as a stroke or tra uma, an EEG with epilept iform abnormalities, a significant brain-imaging abnorma a nocturnal seizure. Clinicians should advise pati ents that, although immediate AED therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likel y to reduce the risk of a seizure recurrence in the 2 years subsequent to a first seizure, it may not improve quality of life. Clinicians should advise patients that over the longer term (> 3 years), immediate AED treatment is unlikely to improve the prognosis for sust ained seizure remission. Patients should be advised tha t their risk for AED AEs ranges f rom 7% to 31% and that these AEs are predominantly mild and reversible. Immediate AED therapy after an unp rovoked first seizure is likely to reduce seizure recurrence risk. A reduction in risk may be important, particularly fo r adults, for whom seizure rec urrences may cause serious psychological and social consequences such as loss of d riving privileges and limitations on employment. However, immediate AED treatment is not well accepted and is debated. Decisions should be based on weighing the risk of rec urrence against the AEs of AED therapy, and should take patient preferences into account. It is accepted that when a patient has a sec ond or additional s eizures, an AED should be ini tiated because the risk of subsequent seizures is very high. Evidence-based guideline: treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children and adults. Guideline Committee of the American Epilepsy Society ( Glauser et al 2016 ). This publication provides conclu sions and a treatment algorithm based on a structured literature review of randomized trials of anticonvulsant treatment s for seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes. A total of 38 trials were included. For treatment in the adult population, conclusions included the following: Intramuscular (IM) midazolam, intravenous (IV) lorazepam, IV di azepam (with or without phenytoin), and IV phenobarbital are established as efficacious at stopping seizur es lasting at least 5 minutes. 138 Data as of February 14, 2019 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 14 of 25 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. IV lorazepam is more effective than IV phenytoin in stopping se izures lasting at least 10 minutes. There is no difference in effica cy between IV lorazepam followe d by IV phenytoin, IV diazepam plus phenytoin followed by IV lorazepam, and IV phenobarbital followed by IV phenytoin. IV valproic acid has similar e fficacy to IV phenytoin or contin uous IV diazepam as second therapy afte r failure of a benzodiazepine. Insufficient data exist in adults about the efficacy of levetir acetam as either initial or second therapy. In adults with status epilepticus without established IV access , IM midazolam is established as more effective compared with IV lorazepam. No significant difference in effectiveness has been demonstrate d between lorazepam and diazepam in adults with status epilepticus. For treatment in the pediatric population, conclusions included the following: IV lorazepam and IV diazepam are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Rectal diazepam, IM midazolam, i ntranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are probably effective at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Insufficient data exist in children about the efficacy of intra nasal lorazepam, sublingual lorazepam, phe nytoin as initial therapy. IV valproic acid has similar effi cacy but better tolerability t han IV phenobarbital as sec ond therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. Insufficient data exist in childr en regarding the efficacy of p henytoin or levetiracetam as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. In children with status epilept icus, no significant difference in effectiveness has been established between IV lorazepam and IV diazepam. In children with status epilepticus, non-IV midazolam (IM/intra nasal/buccal) is probably more effective than diazepam (IV/rectal). Conclusions included the following (age not specified): Insufficient data exist about the comparative efficacy of pheny toin and fosphenytoin. F osphenytoin is better tolerated compared with phenyto in. When both are available, fosphenytoin is preferred based on tolerability, but phenytoin is an acce ptable alternative. The overall treatment a lgorithm directs that: A benzodiazepine (IM midazolam, IV lorazepam, or IV diazepam) i s recommended as the initial therapy of choice in the first phase of tr eatment (5 to 20 minutes after t he beginning of the seizure). Although IV phenobarbital is established as e fficacious and well tolerated as initial therapy, its slower rate of administration positions it as an alternative in itial therapy. For prehospital settings or where first-line benzodiazepine options are not available, rectal diazepam, intranasal midazolam, and b uccal midazolam are reasonable initial therapy alternatives. In the second phase of treatment ( from 20 to 40 minutes after t he beginning of the seizur e), reasonable options include fosphenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. There is no clear evidence that any of these options is better than the others. Because of AEs, IV phenobarbital is a r easonable second-therapy alternative if none of the 3 recommended therapies are available. There is no clear evidence to guide therapy in the third phase of therapy ( 40 minutes after the beginning of the seizure). Evidence-based guideline update: medical treatment of infantile spasms. Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurolo gy and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Go et al 2012 ; reaffirmed in 2015) This publication provides updat ed recommendations for the treatment of infantile spasms. The literature review included an evaluation of 26 publ ished articles on this topic. Recommendations include the following: Evidence is insufficient to reco mmend the use of prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone as being as effective as adrenocorti cotropic hormone (ACTH) for sh ort-term treatment of infantile spasms. Low-dose ACTH should be considered as an alternative to high-do se ACTH for treatment of infantile spasms. ACTH or vigabatrin may be offered for short-te rm treatment of i nfantile spasms; evidence suggests that ACTH may be offered over vigabatrin. 139 Data as of February 14, 2019 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 15 of 25 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Evidence is insufficient to rec ommend other therapies (valproic acid, vitamin B6, ketogenic diet, or novel/c ombination therapies) for treatment of infantile spasms. Hormonal therapy (ACTH or predni solone) may be considered for u se in preference to vi gabatrin in infants with cryptogenic infantile spasms, to possibly improv e developmental outcome. A shorter lag time to treatment of infantile spasms with either hormonal therapy or vigabatrin may be considered to improve long-term cognitive outcomes. There is a lack of sufficient r andomized trials to provide definitive answers to key questi ons related to treatment of infantile spams. Practice parameter: treatment o f the child with a first unprovo ked seizure. Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Hirtz et al 2003 ; reaffirmed in 2016) This parameter reviews publish ed literature relevant to the decision to begin treatment after a child or adolescent experiences a first unprovoked se izure and presents evidence-ba sed practice recommendations. Treatment during the neonatal period is not addressed. Recommendations include the following: Treatment with AEDs is not indica ted for the prevention of the development of epilepsy. Treatment with AEDs may be consi dered in circumstances where th e benefits of reducing the risk of a second seizure outweigh the risks of pharmacologic and psychosocial AE s. The majority of children who ex perience a first unprovoked seiz ure will have few or no recurrences. Treatment with AEDs after a first seizure as opp osed to after a second seizure has not been shown to imp rove prognosis for long- term seizure remission. Treatment has been shown in sev eral studies combining both chil dren and adults to reduce the risk of seizure recurrence; however, there is a r elative paucity of data from s tudies involving only child ren after a first seizure. Summary of recommendations for t he management of infantile seiz ures. Task force repo rt for the ILAE Commission of Pediatrics (Wilmshurst et al 2015 ). This publication recommends an approach to the standard and opt imal management of infants with seizures. When possible, recommendations are evidence-based; however, when no evidence was available, recommendations are based on expert opinion and standard practice. Recommendations/findings include the following: There is no indication for initiation of chronic AEDs for simpl e febrile seizures. However , in the acute treatment of febrile seizures, it is impor tant to treat seizures lasting 10 minutes or longer. In an otherwise healthy infant, a policy of \"wait and see\" is reasonable after the first afebrile seizure. However, this is a rare event and clos e monitoring is essential. Treatment options with establis hed or probable efficacy include the following: not available in the United Stat es) Treatment options with possible efficacy include the following: Generalized clonazepam Provoked or situational seizures: carbamazepine There is no clear evidence supporting an optimal duration of tr eatment; this is dependent on seizure type. Guidelines on neonatal seizures . World Health Organization (WHO) ( WHO 2011). This document was prepared bas ed on a systematic review of the literature and involved co operation between the WHO, the ILAE, and the Internatio nal Bureau of Epilepsy (IBE). Recommendations include the following: Phenobarbital should be used as the first- line agent for treatm ent of neonatal seizures and should be made readily available in all settings. 140 Data as of February 14, 2019 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 16 of 25 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. In neonates who continue to have se izures despite administering the maximum tolerated dose of phenobarbital, either a benzodi azepine, phenytoin, or lidocaine may be used as the second-line agent for control of seizures (use of pheny toin or lidocaine requires car diac monitoring). In neonates with a normal neurologi cal examination and/or normal EEG, stopping AEDs may be considered if the neonate has been se izure-free for > 72 hours; the drug(s) s hould be reinstituted i f seizures recur. In neonates in whom seizure contr ol is achieved with a single A ED, the drug can be di scontinued abruptly without tapering the do se. In neonates requiring > 1 AED for se izure control, the drug s may be stopped one at a time, with phenobarbital being t he last drug to be withdrawn. Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epi lepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence- based review): and perinatal outcomes. Quality Standards Subcommi ttee and Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommitt ee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009A ; reaffirmed in 2013; Update in progress) This publication summarizes evide nce for selected issues regard ing the clinical management of women with epilepsy (WWE) who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant. Recommendations include the following: If possible, avoidance of the us e of valproate as part of polyt herapy during the first tr imester of pregnancy should be considered to decreas e the risk of major congenital m alformations (MCMs). If possible, avoidance of the us e of valproate monotherapy duri ng the first trimester of pregnancy may be considered to decreas e the risk of MCMs. To reduce the risk of MCMs, the use of valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy should be avoided, if possible, compared to the use of carbamazepine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avo idance of the use of polytherapy with valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, should be considered, compared to polyt herapy without valproate. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avo idance of the use of valproate d uring the first trimes ter of pregnancy, if possible, may be considered, compared to the use of phenytoin o r lamotrigine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avo idance of the use of AED polythe rapy during the first trim ester of pregnancy, if possible, compared to monotherapy should be considered. Limiting the dosage of valproate or lamotrigine during the first trimester, if possible, should be considered to lessen the risk of MCMs. Avoidance of the use of valproat e, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and facial clefts, and may be con sidered to reduce the risk of hypospadias. Avoidance of phenytoin, carbamaz epine, and phenobarbital, if po ssible, may be consider ed to reduce the risk of specific MCMs: cleft palate for phenytoin use, posterior cle ft palate for carbamazepine use, and cardiac malformations for phenobarbital use. Carbamazepine exposure probably does not produce cognitive impa irment in offspring of WWE. Avoiding valproate in WWE duri ng pregnancy, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Avoiding phenytoin and phenobarbi tal in WWE during pregnancy, i f possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Monotherapy should be considered in place of polytherapy, if po ssible, for WWE who take AEDs during pregnancy to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possi ble, should be con sidered compared to carbamazepine to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possible, may be considered compared to phenytoin to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Valproate has the most data show ing an association with risk from in utero exposure. If a c hange from valproate to another AED is planned, it is pr udent to make this change well before pregnancy. Although many of the reco mmendations in this parameter suggest minimizing AED exposure during pregnancy, for most WWE, discontinuing AEDs is not a reasonable or safe option . Discontinuing AEDs may expose the mother and fetus to physical injury from a ccidents due to seizure activity .

Therapeutics and Techno logy Assessment Subc ommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009B ; reaffirmed in 2013; U pdate in progress) This publication summarizes evide nce for selected issues regard ing the clinical management of WWE who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant. Recommendations include the following: The placenta may be factored into the clinical decision regarding the necessity of AED tr eatment for a woman with epile psy. Monitoring of lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin levels during pregnancy should be considered. Monitoring of levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine (as monohydroxy d erivative) levels du ring pregnancy may be considered. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute a change in phenobarbital, valproate, primidone, or ethosuximide levels related to p regnancy, but this lack of evid ence should not discourage monitoring levels of these AEDs during pregnancy. Valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may not transfer into breast milk to as great an extent as primidone, levetiracetam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topir amate. Although many of the AEDs were shown to cross the placenta or e nter breast milk, studies were limited in duration and did not systematically eva luate neonatal symptoms. Guidelines also support the use of AEDs for several common non-epilepsy indications: The American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society state that AEDs with established efficacy for migraine prevention include valp roate, divalproex sodium, and t opiramate; carbamazepine is noted to be possibly effective ( Silberstein et al 2012; reaffirmed in 2015; Update in progress). The American Academy of Neurology, American Association of Neur omuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and American Academy of Physical Medi cine and Rehabi litation state that, for relief of painful diabetic neuropathy, pregabalin is established as effective, and gabapentin and valp roate are probably effective ( Bril et al 2011 ; Update in progress). The American Academy of Neurology states that gabapentin and pr egabalin are of benefit in reducing pain from postherpetic neuralgia ( Dubinsky et al 2004 ). American Psychiatric Associatio n guidelines describe the key ro le of AEDs in the management of bipolar disorder, including the following ( Hirschfeld et al 2002): First-line pharmacol ogical treatment for mo re severe manic or m ixed episodes is either lithium plus an antipsychotic or valproate plus an antipsychotic; for less ill patients, monotherapy with lithium, valproate, or an antipsychotic may be sufficient. F or mixed episodes, valproate may be preferred over lithium. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are alternatives. First-line pharmacol ogical treatment for bi polar depression is either lithium or lamotrigine. When an acute depressive episode of bipolar disorder does not respond to firs t-line medication treatment, the next steps include adding lamotrigine, bupropion, or paroxetine. The initial treatment for patient s who experience rapid cycling should include lithium or va lproate; an alternative is lamotrigine. The medications with the best e mpirical evidence to support the ir use in maintenance treatment include lithium and valproate; possible alternatives include lamotrigine, carba mazepine, or oxcarbazepine. Note: This guideline was publis hed in 2002 and cannot be assume d to be current; however, AEDs continue to be recommended for both acute (mania or hypomania) and maintena nce phases of bipolar disorder (Post 2017, Stovall 2018). SAFETY SUMMARY Tolerability and safety are as im portant as effi cacy in determi ning the overall effectivene ss of epilepsy treatment (Schachter 2018 ).

(carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine) tremor, anxiety, nervousness, insomnia aggression, irritability, hyperactivity depression, mood alteration confusion ataxia blurred or double vision Examples of rare but serious AEs include the following ( Schachter 2018 ): suicidal ideation and behavior (AEDs boxed warnings related to potentially se rious AEs; these include the following: Carbamazepine: Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including TEN and SJS, have been reported. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry hav e found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inhe rited allelic variant of the HLA -B gene. Patients with ancestry in genetically at-risk populations (across broa d areas of Asia) should be scre ened for the presence of HLA-B*1502 prior to initiating treatment with carbamazepine. Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been reported. If a pa tient exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient s hould be monitored closely, and discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depressio n develops. Clobazam, clonazepam, clorazepate, and diazepam: Concomitant use benzodiazepines and opioids may result in pr ofound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Concomitant prescribing should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequat e, and patients should be follow ed for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Felbamate: Use is associated with a marked increase in the incidence of ap lastic anemia. Felbamate should only be used in patients whose epilepsy is s o severe that the risk of aplastic anemia is deemed acceptable. Routine blood testing cannot be reliably used to reduce the incidence of apla stic anemia, but it will in some cases allow detection of hematologic changes b efore the syndr ome declares i tself clinically. Felbamate should be discontinued if any evidence of bone marrow depression occurs. Cases of acute liver failure hav e been reported. Felbamate shou ld not be prescribed for anyone with a history of hepatic dysfunction. Treatmen t should be initiated only in individuals without active liver disease and with normal baseline serum transamina ses. It has not been proven that periodic serum transaminase testing will 143 Data as of February 14, 2019 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 19 of 25 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Serum transaminases should be monitored at baseline and per iodically thereafter. Felbamate should be discontinued if either aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) become increased to 2 times the upper limit of normal, or if clinical signs and symptoms suggest liver failure , and should not be consid ered for retreatment. Fosphenytoin and phenytoin: There is a cardiovascu lar risk associated w ith rapid IV infusio n rates. The rate of administration should not exceed recommendations, and care ful cardiac monitoring is requi red. Lamotrigine: Cases of life-threatening seriou s skin rashes, including SJS and TEN, and/or rash-re lated death have been caused by lamotrigine. Benign rash es are also caused by lamotri gine; however, it is not possible to predict which rashes will prov e to be serious. Lam otrigine should be di scontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. Perampanel: Serious or life-threatening ps ychiatric and behavioral AEs aggression, hostilit y, irritability, anger, and homicidal ideation and threats hav e been reported. Patients sho uld be monitored for these reactions and for changes in mood, behavior, or personality. The dose should be reduced if these symptoms occur, and it should be discontinued if symptoms are severe or worsening. Valproic acid and divalproex sodium: Hepatotoxicity, including fata lities, have been reported, usually during the first 6 m onths of treatment. Serum liver tests are required and pati ents should be monitored close ly. There is a risk to fetuses exposed in utero, particularly neura l tube defects, other major malformations, and decreased intelligence quotient ( IQ). Valproate should not be given to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical conditio n, and women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Pancreatitis, including fatal hem orrhagic cases, has occurred. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting , and/or anorexia can be sympto ms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. Vigabatrin: Vigabatrin can cause permanent bila teral concentric visual fiel d constriction, including tunnel vision that can result in disability. In some cases, vigabatrin may also damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Baseline and periodic vi sion assessment is recommended. However, this assessment cannot always prevent vision damage, and once detected, vision loss due to vigabatrin is not reversible. Vigabatrin should be withdrawn from patients who fail to show substantial clinical b enefit. Due to the risks of vision loss , vigabatrin is available only t hrough a risk evaluation mitigation strategy (REMS) program ( Vigabatrin REMS 2017 ). Healthcare providers who prescribe vigabatrin and pharmacies that dispense the product must be spec ially certified. Each patient must be enrolled in the REMS program. Prescribers must ensure that per iodic visual monitoring is performed and report any AE suggestive of vision loss to the an antineoplastic, immunosuppressant agent with several adverse reactions. The most common AE that occurred in trials for TSC-associated p artial-onset seizures was stomatitis. More serious AEs include: non-infectious pneumonitis infections hypersensitivity reactions (when taken with an angiotensin converting enzyme in hibitor) renal failure impaired wound healing myelosuppression reduced immune response with vaccination hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia embryo-fetal toxicity 144 Data as of February 14, 2019 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 20 of 25 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

These products vary in terms of t heir indications for specific seizure types and indications other than epilepsy. Overall, the anticonvulsants hav e demonstrated efficacy for the ir FDA-approved uses. Whe n possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Patients who are refractory to monotherapy may be treated with combination therapy. When considering combination therapy, it is recommended to combine medications with differen t mechanisms of action and AE profiles. Comparative efficacy data for the management of epilepsy are limited. Tolerability and safety are as im portant as effi cacy in determi ning the overall effectiveness of epilepsy treatment. Both systemic AEs and neurologic AEs commonly occur. Some AEDs are a ssociated with rare but serious AEs, and careful patient selection and monitoring are required. Epilepsy management can be complex and is often performed by ne urologists. A variety of AEDs should be available to allow clinicians to select the most clinically appropriate agen t for individual patients. Anticonvulsants are also establis hed as effective for several non-epilepsy indications, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine and neuropathic June 2 015.

Therapeutic Class Overview Ophthalmic Agents, Intraocular Pressure (IOP)-Modifying INTRODUCTION Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy t hat causes gradual degeneration of the cells making up the optic nerve. Glaucoma is among the leading causes of blindness worldwide, and in 2020, a n estimated 3.2 milli on people worldwide are anticipated to be blind due to glaucoma ( Flaxman et al 2017 ). Open-angle form; include angle-closure, congenital, and secondary glaucoma (Jacobs 2018[a]). Patients with open-angle glaucoma initially experience peripheral visual field loss, followed by central field loss, which may progress to irreversible blindnes s if untreated (Jacobs 2018[a]). The exact etiology of open-angle glaucoma is unknown (Jacobs 2018[a]). Major risk factors for developing open-ang le glaucoma include advanced age, African or Hispanic/Lat ino descent, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), family history of glaucoma, low ocu lar perfusion pressure, ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus, and myopia (Ellis et al 2000, Girkin et al 2 004, Lesk et al 2007, Prum et al 2016) . Elevated IOP is the only major ri sk factor for glaucoma that is treatable. Available evidence suggests that lowering IOP inhibits or reduces the prog ression of optic nerve damage (Jacobs 2018[a]). Treatment may be initia ted in patients with a raised IOP despite having no vi sual field loss or optic nerve damage (Jacobs 2018[a]) . An IOP > 22 to 25 mmHg is generally considered to be elevated and would be treated by most clinicians; however, this num ber varies according to screening methods, risk factor s, and disease progression (Jacobs 2018[b]). The target IOP should be individualized based on response to ther apy and disease progression in order t o maintain IOP within a r ange that is unlikely to adversely affect patients' heal th-related quality of life (Jacobs 2018[b]) . The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommends an initial tar get IOP reduction of 25% from pr etreated baseline IOP. However, depending on the severity of disease, this target m ay vary since there is no con sensus target IOP bel ow which further v isual loss and optic nerve damage will be prevented (Prum et al 2016) . The current treatment of glaucoma focuses on decreasing IOP by 1 of 3 methods: laser therapy, surgery, or medical intervention (Prum et al 2016) . Medical intervention is genera lly used as initial therapy pri or to laser or surgical treatment (Jacobs 2018[b]) . Medical intervention includes 6 classes of ophthalmic drugs used for the long-term management of kinase (ROCK) inhibitors (Jacobs 2018[b], Micromedex 2019) . These treatments reduce IOP by either decreasin g the amount of aqueous humor pro duced by the ciliary body or by increasing uveoscleral outflow (Micromedex 2019, Prum et al 2016) . Miotics, prostaglandin analogues, and ROCK inhibitors increase aqueous outflow, while beta-blockers and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease aqueous humor production (Micromedex 2019). Alpha-agonists decrease the amount of aqueous humor formed and increase its outflow (Micromedex 2019, Prum et al 2016) . Guidelines published in 2010 by the American Optometric Associa tion (AOA) do not recommend preferential use of any drug class, although current guidelines by the AAO generally re commend ophthalmic prostaglandin analogues as first- line pharmacologic therapy in patients with elevated IOP (AOA 2010, Prum et al 2016) . Combination or monotherapy with agents from an alternative pharmacologic class is recommen ded for patients who experi ence intolerable adverse events or who do not achieve the optimal IOP reduction with fir ilable as Latisse (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution) 0. 03% and indicated to treat hypotrichosis of the eyelashes by increasing their growth inclu ding length, thickness and da rkness. Latisse is applied nightly directly to the skin of the upper eyelid margin at the base of the eyelashes using an applicator. Latisse is included here for informational purposes since it contains the same ingredient used for the reduction of elevated IOP. Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Drug Class Comparisons In a large systematic review of medical therapy compared to var ious surgical treatments, e vidence was insufficient to show that medical, laser, or surgical treatments of open-angle glaucoma prevented progressive visual field loss, optic nerve damage, any kind of patient reported outcomes, or visual impairment. Very little direc t comparative evidence is available (Boland et al 2012, Boland et al 2013) . A network meta-analysis included 114 randomized controlled tria ls (n = 20,725) evaluating single active ophthalmic agents for the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma (Li et al 2016) . All trials compared acti ve first-line drugs to no treatment or placebo or another single topical agent for glauco ma. The mean reductions in IO P at 3 months (reported as mmHg) were as follows: bimatopros CI, 2.89 to 4.29), carteolol 3 (95 % CI, 2.42 to 4.46), levobetaxolol 2.56 (95% CI, 1.52 to 3.62) (currently not availa ble in U.S.), apraclonidine 2. 52 (95% CI, 0.94 to 4.11), to 1.59 to 2.88), and unoprostone 1.91 (95% CI, 1.15 to 2.67) (currently n ot available in the U.S.). T he authors concluded that the ophthalmic prostaglandin analogue s have the greatest effect on IOP. A network meta-analysis evaluated 72 randomized controlled trials (n = 19,916) that report ed efficacy and safety of medications for the treatmen t of primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension over at least 3 months ( Li et al 2018 ). A total of 15 treatments were directly compared for change in IOP. Compared to prostaglandin analogues, beta- blockers showed relatively wea ker ability followe d by alpha-agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The most powerful combinations for dual therapy included prostaglandin analogues with another agent for lowering IOP; combinations with 2 non-prostaglandin analogues had lower effic acy in controlling IOP t han monotherapy with a prostaglandin analogue. More severe hyperemia was associated wi th prostaglandin analogues compared to any other monotherapy, with beta-blockers having the lowest effect on the incidence of hyperemia. Most 2-drug combinations with prostaglandin analogues also led to serious hyperemia with the exception of the combinati on of prostaglandin analogues and alpha-agonists. A network meta-analysis evaluated data from 28 randomized contr olled trials in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for peak (n = 6841) and trough (n = 6953) effect of 8 drugs ( van der Valk et al 2009). from plac ebo in reducing IOP. At th e peak, the largest red uction in mean IOP was observed with the prostaglandin analogues - bimatoprost, travop rost, and latanoprost. At the trough, the largest reduction in mean IOP was also w ith the prostaglandin analogues with bimatoprost followed by latanoprost and travoprost. The ophthalmic prostaglandin anal ogues have consistently demons trated comparable or greater efficacy when compared to dorzolamide/timolol (Coleman et al 2003, Fechtner et al 2004, Ko nstas et al 2008, Lesk et al 2008, Ozturk et al 2007, Sharpe et al 2008) . Bimatoprost 0.03% significant ly reduced the mean IOP compared to dorzolamide/timolol in a 6 week crossover trial (p = 0.03) ( Sharpe et al 2008 ). In patients uncontrolled on beta-blocker monotherapy, bimatoprost also significantly reduced the mean IOP at 8 AM compared to dorzolamide/timolol in a 3 month study (Coleman et al 2003) . However, in a small study of 65 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the efficacy of low ering IOP was similar between bimatoprost and dorzolami de/timolol over a 6 month study period (p = 0.48) ( Ozturk et al 2007 ). A meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials found tha t latanoprost was associated with greater efficacy in lowering the diurnal mean I OP compared to the combination of dorzolamide/timolol in patients who were inadequately c ontrolled with timolol monother apy. Latanoprost was as effective as dorzolamide/timolol in patients without prior timolol treatment (Cheng et al 2009 ). A meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials with 1256 pa tients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension showed significant reductions in IOP with latanoprost compared to timolol. Latanoprost res ulted in an average 1.6 mmHg further lowering in IOP comp ared to timolol (p < 0.001) ( Zhang et al 2001 ). Alpha-Agonists The comparative clinical trial data regarding the safety and ef ficacy of the ophthalmic alpha-agonists are limited. When the ophthalmic alpha-a gonists are used for the management of postoperative elevations in IOP, both ophthalmic brimonidine and apraclonidine ar e effective treatment options w ith similar efficacy (Barnes et al 1999, Chen et al 2001, Chen et al 2005, Sterk et al 1998) . 155 Data as of January 24, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/KMR Page 6 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In a meta-analysis of 2 double-b lind, multicenter, fo r safety and tolerability ov er 12 months. In 1 study, brimonidine purite 0.15% had lo wer ocular treatment-related adverse events including allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, and eye discharge compared to brimonidine 0.2% (p 0.025). The second study found a statistically significantly lower overall inci dence of treatment-related adve to brimonidine 0.2% (p = 0.014). T he pooled data demonstrated a re duced overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events proportional to t he reductions in the concentration of t he active ingredient (p < 0.001) (Cantor et al 2009 ). A Cochrane review of 22 randomiz ed controlled trials (n = 2112) assessed the effectiveness of medications administered perioperatively to p revent temporarily increased I OP after laser trabeculoplasty in patients with open-angle glaucoma (Zhang et al 2017) . Compared to placebo, fewer pati ents ratio, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.20; mode rate-certainty evidence). This effect was maintained up to 24 hours after the operation. In 3 studies, perioperative bri monidine was associated with hig her rates of conjunctival blanching compared to placebo. In a comparison of perioperative brimonidine vs apraclonidine ( 3 randomized controlled trials) , the review was unable to determine whether brimonidine or apraclonidine was better in pr eventing IOP increases within 2 hours after surgery due to inconsistency, imprecision o f the estimated effect, and stud y bias (risk ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 0.32 to 16.03; very low- certainty evidence). The author s concluded that it is unclear whether 1 medication in the alpha-agonist class is better than another. There was no notabl e difference between apracloni dine and pilocarpine in the mean change in IOP measurement from pre-procedure to 2 hours after surgery. Beta-Blockers Timolol has been a frequent compa rator in numerous clinical tri als with agents for the treat ment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Head-to-head studies in the ophthalmic beta-block er class involving patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension have shown that all treatments are efficaci ous in decreasing IOP from baseline; however, conflicting results were seen when groups we re compared to each other. Stud ies that reported adverse events categorized all events as mild to moderate; the most frequent adverse events reported included burning or stinging upon instillation and tearing ( Berry et al 1984, Berson et al 1985, Boozman et al 1988, Evans et al 1999, Geyer et al 1998, Halper et al 2002, Krieglstein et al 1987, Miki et al 2004, Mills et al 1986, Mundorf et al 2004, Schenker et al 2000, Shedden et al 2001, Sonty et al 2009, Stewart et al 1986, Stewart et al 200 2, Vogel et al 1989, Walters et al 1998, Watson et al 2001 ). Studies invol ving patients 0.5% have found conflicting results with regard to decr ease in IOP from baseline (Berry et al 1984, Evans et al 1999, Miki et al 2004, Stewart et al 1986, Vogel et al 1989) . Specifically, 1 study found that betaxolol 0.5% maintained the decrease in IOP that occur red from earlier treatment with timolol maleate 0.5% (Miki et al 2004 ). In another study, betaxolol 0.5 % was not found to significantly lower IOP after a washout period following treatment with timolol maleate 0.5% (p = 0.09) ( Evans et al 1999 ). In a separate study, betaxolol 0 .5% was shown to produce a sign ificant decrease in IOP from baseline at weeks 1 through 12 when both the mean IOP value averaged for both eyes and the worse eye were analyzed (p 0.001). In this same study, timolol maleate 0.5% was not found to produce a significant decrease in IOP during weeks 1 through 8 when the mean IOP was averaged for both eyes (p 0.05), as w ell as at week 12 when the worse eye was analyzed (p values not reported) (Vogel et al 1989) . Additional studies have found t hat the difference from baseline in IOP was significant for both betaxolol and timolol groups, and there was no difference between groups in the reduc tion of IOP (Berry et al 1984, Stewart et al 1986) . All studies reported mild adverse events including burning or s tinging upon instillation and tearing. Although several studies have reported that betaxolol 0.5% was associated with m ore burning and/or stingi ng upon instillation than timolol 0.5%, only 1 study found th is difference to be statisti cally significant (Berry et al 1984, Vogel et al 1989) . One study compared ophthalmic fo carteolol hydrochloride 1% and timolol 0.25% and found that all 3 treatments significantly decreased IOP from ba seline. However, carteolol 1% and greater reductions in IOP betaxolol 0.5% initially and maintained this difference thr ough the follow up period (p values not reported). Eventually , betaxolol 0.5% achieved the s ame level of IOP after 12 mont hs. In this study, the lowest number of adverse events was reported in the carteolol 1% group , followed by timolol 0.25%, and betaxolol 0.5% groups (p values not reported) (Watson et al 2001) . 156 Data as of January 24, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/KMR Page 7 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Studies involving levobunolol 0 .25%, 0.5%, and 1% found this agent to significantly decre ase IOP from baseline; however, significant treatment di fferences in IOP reduction wer e not found when compared to ophthalmic formulations of al 1985, Boozma n et al 1988, Geyer et al 1998, Halper et al 2002, Krieglstei n et al 1987, Walters et al 1998) . Specifically, when levobunolol 0 .5% was compared to metipranolo l 0.6%, both groups saw significant differences from baseline IOP after 12 weeks of tr eatment with decreases of -7.2 mmHg in the and -7.4 mmHg in the metipranolol 0.6% gr oup (p value not reported) (Krieglstein et al 1987) . When levobunolol 0.25% was compa red to timolol maleate 0.25%, t he mean changes in IOP from baseline to 48 weeks were reported as -5.1 mmHg in the levobunolol timolol maleate 0.25% group (p value not reported) (Boozman et al 1988) . The majority of studies did not r eport significant differences in adverse events between tr eatment groups. However, in a study between levobunolol 0.5% and the levobunolol 0.5% group experienced at least 1 adverse event (p = 0.024). Additionally, the incidence of burning and/or stinging was found to be significantly higher in the le vobunolol 0.5% group (p < 0.00 1) (Halper et al . One study compared metipranolol 0.3% to timolol 0.25% and found that both treatments significantly decreased IOP from baseline. There was a larger re duction in IOP in the metipranolol 0.3% group; however, the difference was not found to be statistically significant (p value not reported) (Mills et al 1986) . Studies comparing different formulations of ophthalmic al 2000, Shedden et al 2001, Sonty et al 2009, Stewart et al 2002) . The studies showed that all fo rms of ophthalmic timolol signi ficantly decreased IOP from baseline, and no significant differences wer e found with regard to reductions in IOP between formulations. One study found that timolol-LA ( Istalol) significantly decreas ed heart rate when compared to timolol maleate 0.5% (p < 0.05) and also caused more stinging and burning (p = 0.001) (Mundorf et al 2004) . A separate study that ti molol maleate GFS 0.5% to timo lol 0.5% found that the pat ients in the GFS group had significantly more blurred vision as well as tearing (p = 0 .04 for both). However, the same study also found that timolol 0.5% caused significantly more burning and stinging whe n compared to the GFS (p = 0.04). It was also found that timolol maleate GFS 0.5% c aused less decline in heart rate after 12 weeks of treatmen t (p = 0.024); however, this was not found to be significant at 24 weeks of treatment (Shedden et al 2001) . Beta-Blockers compared to other drug classes When beta-blockers wer e compared to single entity formulations of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and prostaglandin analogues, conflicting results we re found with regard to the difference in IOP-lowering effect (Cantor et al 2001, Haneda et al 2006, Ikeda et al 2008, March et al 2000, Rusk et al 1998, Silver et al 1998, Strahlman et al 1995, Varma et al 2009, Walters et al 2004) . In studies between betaxolol 0. 25% and brimonidine 0.2% as well as dorzolamide 2%, no significant differences were seen between groups ( Cantor et al 2001, Rusk et al 1998, Strahlman et al 1995 ). Similar results were found in studies comparing timolol 0.5% to brinzolamide 1% and latano prost comparing carteolol 1% and latanoprost 0.005% ( March et al 2000, Varma et al 2009, Haneda et al 2006 ). In a separate study comparing ti molol GFS 0.5% to bimatoprost 0 found that bimatoprost 0.03% significantly reduced IOP from baseline when compared to timolol GFS 0.5% (p < 0.001). This same study also that l atanoprost 0.005% provided signifi cantly more IOP reduction from compared to timolol GFS 0.5% (p < 0.002) (Walters et al 2004) . In an additional study, latanopros t 0.005% was found to provide significantly more IOP r eduction from baseline when compared to betaxolol 0.25%, carteolol 1%, and nipradilol 2008) . Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Trials support the FDA-approved indications for ophthalmic form ulations of brinzolamide and dorzolamide. The trials evaluated the effectiveness of thes e agents over 1 week to 18 months and demonstrated that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are a viable treatmen t option for the management of elevated IOP ( Azopt prescribing information 2015 and Trusopt prescribing However, the efficacy of ophthal mic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in reducing vision loss due to glaucoma has not been established in clinica l trials (Jacobs 2018[b]) . 157 Data as of January 24, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/KMR Page 8 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Reduction in IOP from baseline was statis tically significant in each group (p < 0.001); however, the changes in IOP from baseline were comparable between the treatm ent groups (p value not reported) (Silver 1998). In a safety trial, significantly fewe r patients reported ocular disc omfort, specifically burning and stinging, with brinzolamide compared to dorzolamide (p < 0.001) . Taste disturbance was reported in up to 1 2% of patients in the brinzolamide group, while only 8.5% of patients in the dorzolamide group exp erienced this adverse event (Silver 2000). Similar reductions in IOP were also observed when the agents we re used in combination with timolol (Michaud et al 2001). Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors compared to other classes The single agent carbonic anhydras e inhibitors were compared to beta-blockers (March et al 2000, Rusk et al 1998, Strahlman et al 1995) . Brinzolamide was compared to timolol, while dorzolamide was c timolol and betaxolol. In these trials, timolol demonstr ated a greater reduction in IO P than both brinzolamide and dorzolamide. In a double-blind, multicenter, rolled trial, timolol was asso ciated with a reduction in IOP comp ared to brinzolamide, administ ered either twice or 3 ti mes daily (p = 0.0002) (March et al 2000). When dorzolamide was compared to betaxolol or timolol in a 1 ye ar, double-blind, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, all 3 treatmen t groups exhibited comparable I OP lowering from baseline (23, 21, and 25%, respectively; p value not reported) (Strahlman et al 1995) . Another multicenter randomized controlled trial found dorzolami de and betaxolol to be comparable in terms of IOP reduction from baseline (p value not reported) (Rusk et al 1998). The safety and efficacy of brinz olamide and dorzolamide were co mpared to brimonidine. All 3 groups in this study received the study treatment as add -on therapy to a prostagland in analogue of the clinicians' choice . Brimonidine was associated with a significantly g reater reduction in IOP than e ither brinzolamide or dorzolamide after 1 and 4 months of therapy (p < 0.001 for both groups) (Bournias et al 2009) . Miotics The clinical trial data regardi ng the safety and efficacy of the ophthalmic miotics are very limited. These agents have been available for many years and are recognized as an established treatment option ( Prum et al 2016 ). No clinical trials have been published in the last 30 years on echothiophate iodid e. Miotics compared to other drug classes For the treatment of glaucoma, ophthalmic pilocarpine has demon strated comparable carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta-blockers, and pr ostaglandin (Bayer et al 2004, Diestelhorst et al 2000, Hartenbaum et al 1999). A trial has evaluated pilocarpine plus a beta-blocker and foun d that pilocarpine is an effective agent at reducing IOP with comparable efficacy to pro staglandin analogues (Diestelhorst et al 2000). In a head-to-head trial comparing apraclonidine to pilocarpine administered 15 minutes bef ore ophthalmic surgery, no significant differences were obs erved between the agents in their ability to reduce IOP after surgery (Ren et al 1999). Prostaglandin Analogues Several meta-analyses with the prostaglandin analogues have been published. Ophthalmic bima toprost appears to have the greatest efficacy in reduci ng IOP; however, trials have not consistently demonstrated a difference in IOP reduction between travoprost and latanoprost (Aptel et al 2008, Cheng et al 2008, Honrub ia et al 2009, Li et al 2006, Lin et al 2014, Sawada et al 2012) . A systematic review of 32 randomized controlled trials compared prostaglandin analogues for primary open-angle glaucoma, using timolol as a reference comparator. The analysis found that bimatoprost was m ost likely to achieve treatment success, defined as a 30% reduction in IOP (relative risk, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1 .98). The relative risk for treatment success with latanoprost was 1.32 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1. 74), for travoprost was 1.33 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.72), and for tafluprost was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.42). In terms of tolerability, bimat oprost was associated with the highest risk of developing hyperemia, w hile latanoprost had the lowest risk (Lin et al 2014) . The results of a meta-analysis w ith 8 trials (N = 1610) demonst rated that reductions in IOP were significantly greater with bimatoprost 0.03% compared to travoprost at 8 AM (p = 0.00 4) and 12 noon (p = 0.02), but not at 4 PM (p = 0.19) or 9 PM (p = 0.07). Bimatoprost 0.03% also demonstrated g reater reductions in IOP compared to latanoprost at 158 Data as of January 24, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/KMR Page 9 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

There were no st atistically significant differ ences between latanoprost and tr avoprost at any time point (Aptel et al 2008) . Results from a meta-analysis by Li et al did not demonstrate a significant difference in IOP reductions between bimatoprost 0.03% and travoprost ( p = 0.8) or latanoprost and t ravoprost (p = 0.07) in 12 studies with 3048 patents with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension (Li et al 2006) . A meta-analysis of 13 trials eva luating adverse events associat ed with the ophthalmic prostaglandin analogues showed that latanoprost had a lower incidence of conjunctival h yperemia compared to both bimatoprost 0.03% and travoprost (p < 0.0001 for both) (Honrubia et al 2009) . Tafluprost was FDA approved in 2012, several years after other prostaglandin analog ues; therefore, ta fluprost data has not been included in many meta-analyses. Available trials suggest that tafluprost may have a similar IOP-lowering effect as latanoprost, but less than that of travoprost (Konstas et al 2013, Schnober et al 2010, Traverso et al 2010, Uusitalo et al 2010[b]) . One trial found no significant d ifference in IOP reduction from baseline between taflupros t and travoprost following 6 weeks of treatment (difference , 0.17 mmHg; 95% CI, -1.268 to 1. 608; p = 0.811) (Traverso et al 2010) . In a 6 week crossover trial, tr avoprost significantly reduced I OP from baseline compared to tafluprost (7.2 vs 6.6 mmHg; p = 0.01). Adverse events were similar between the treatment groups (Schnober et al 2010) . In a randomized, double-blind tr (n = 533), tafluprost demon strated non-inferiority to latanoprost after 24 months (p < 0.05). No difference in the incidence of adverse events was reported between treatments (Uusitalo et al 2010[b]) . Results from a similar trial demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of ocular irritation/ burning, tearing, itching, dry eye sensation, and conjunctival h yperemia when switched from latanoprost to tafluprost due to o cular intolerance (p < 0.001 for all). Tafluprost also si gnificantly reduced IOP compa red to baseline treatment wit h latanoprost (16.4 vs 16.8 mmHg; p 2010[a]) . (preserva tive-free) twice daily for monotherapy treatment of 643 patient s with glaucoma or ocular hypertension in a double-blind, active control, randomized controlled trial. Taf luprost was non-inferior to tim olol in IOP reduction at all visits and time points based upon a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1.5 mmHg. Conjunc tival (1.2%; p = 0.016) (Chabi et al 2012) . A pooled analysis of 2 similarly designed, Phase 3, double-mask ed, active control, multicent er, non-inferiority trials (APOLLO and LUNAR; N = 840 tota l) found that latanoprostene bun od 0.024% administered once daily led to greater reductions in mean IOP when comp ared to timolol maleate 0.5% ad ministered twice daily at a ll evaluation time points (IOP was measured at 8AM, 12 PM, and 4PM at week 2, week 6, a nd months 3, 6, 9, and 12) (p < 0.001 for all) (Medeiros et al 2016, Weinreb et al 2016, Weinreb et al 2018). A greater proportion of patients treated with latanoprostene bunod vs timolol attained a mean IOP 18mmHg a nd an IOP reduction 25 % from baseline (p < 0.001). Patients who sw itched over from timolol to latanoprostene bunod also experienced additional IOP lowering (p 0.009). Efficacy was maintained th rough 12 months of therapy. Latanoprostene bunod was also evaluated in a 28 day, Phase 2, r andomized, investigator-mas ked, active control, multicenter, dose-ranging study ( n = 413). The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of latanoprostene bunod vs latanopr ost 0.005%, and to determine th e optimum drug concentrations of latanoprostene bunod in reducing IOP. Patients were randomized into 1 of 5 tre atment groups, including 4 different concentrations of latanoprostene bunod for latanoprostene was dose-dependent and reache to 0 .040%. Latanoprostene bunod 0.024% led to significantly greater reductions in mean di urnal IOP compared with latanoprost 0.005% -7.77 pectively; p = 0.005). A significantly greater proport ion of patients had mean diurnal IOP 18 mmHg in the lat anoprostene bunod 0.024% group at all measurement time points (p 0.046) compared to th e latanoprost group. ROCK Inhibitor The safety and efficacy of netarsudil were evaluated in 3 Phase 3, randomized, double-masked , active control, parallel group, multicenter trials. were randomized to ophthalm ic netarsudil or timolol male ate 0.5%. In these trials, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean IOP, measured at multipl e time points (8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM at week 2, week 6, and at 3 months). Netarsudil was considered to be non-inferi or to timolol if the upper lim it of the 2-sided 95% CIs around the difference (netarsud il - timolol) was within 1.5 mmH g at all time points and wa s within 1.0 mmHg at a majority of the time points (Rhopressa FDA Medical Review, Rhopressa Pr escribing Information 2017, Serle et al 2018). 159 Data as of January 24, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/KMR Page 10 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Overall, netarsudil 0.02% dosed o nce a day demonst rated statist ically significant reductio ns of up to 5 mmHg in IOP from baseline in t he clinical trials. In ROCKET-1, netarsudil failed in its primary endpoint; netarsu dil was not non-inferior to timolol in patients with baseline IOP < 27 mmHg. However, netarsudil was non-inferior to timolol in patients with a baseline IOP < 25 mmHg in a post-hoc analysis. Netarsud il did have an IOP-lowering eff ect at baseline IOPs 25 mmHg, but was not statistically non-inferior to timo lol when including these pati ents ( Rhopressa FDA Review, Serle et al 2018) . In ROCKET-2, netarsudil achieved success in its primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiori ty to timolol in patients with a baseline IOP < 25 mmHg (Rhopressa FDA Medical Review, Serle et al 2018) . In ROCKET-4, netarsudil achieved success in its primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiori ty to timolol in patients with a baseline IOP < 30 mmHg in the per-protocol (PP) populati on, but this result was not replicated in the intent-to- treat (ITT) population. In a secondary endpoi nt analysis, non-i nferiority of netarsudil to ti molol was demonstrated in patients with baseline IOP < 25 mmHg in both PP and ITT populat ions (Rhopressa FDA Medical Review). Netarsudil was also evaluated in a 28 day, Phase 2, dose-respon se, double-masked, active control, parallel group, multicenter trial evaluating net arsudil compared with latanopro st solution, in patients with o pen-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The study found that netarsudil 0.02% was less effective than latanoprost by approximately 1 mmHg in patients with unmedicated IOPs o f 22 to 35 mmHg (differences fr om latanoprost in the change from baseline mean diurnal IOP for netarsudil 0.02% were 0.9 mmHg at day 14 and 1. 2 mmHg at day 28) ( Bacharach et al 2015 ). Fixed Dose Combinations Combigan (brimonidine/timolol) The combination of brimonidine/timolol has been shown to be saf e and effective in reducing mean IOP from baseline (Craven et al 2005, Go\u00f1i et al 2005, Sherwood et al 2006) . In clinical trials comparing the fixed combination to the individual components, the reduct ion of IOP with brimonidine/ti molol dosed twice a day was slightly less than that seen with the concomitant adminis tration of timolol maleate oph s olution 0.2% dosed 3 times per day. The combination of brimonidine/timolol was compared to latanopr ost 0.005% in 148 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension in a randomized , investigator-masked study (Katz et al 2012) . The primary outcome, mean diurnal IOP at 12 weeks, did not demonstrate a significant difference betwe en treatment groups at any time point or mean change from baseline at any time point at week 12. The reported mean d iurnal IOP at week 12 was 17.8 mmHg for brimonidine/timolol and 17.9 mmH g -0.14 (95% CI, - 1.27 to 0.98), demonstrating n on-inferiority of fixed br imonidine/timolol to latanoprost based on predefined criteria. Nine patients in the combination group discontin ued the study compared to 2 patients treated with latanoprost, mostly due to adverse effe cts. Treatment-related adver se events were reported in 16.4% of patients treated with b rimonidine/timolol compared to 10.7% treated with latanoprost. Simbrinza (brinzolamide/brimonidine) The efficacy and safety of the co mbination of brinzolamide/brim onidine were established in controlled trials. The brinzolamide/bri monidine 1%/0.2% combination was shown to significantly lower the mean IOP compared to either monotherapy (eg, brinzolamide and brimonidine) at all time points of the day in 2 identical, 3 month studies. Adverse even ts were mostly ocular in nature, and the combination group had a higher percentage of patients reporting adverse eve nts compared to each monotherapy group (Katz et al 2013, Nguyen et al 2013, Realini et al 2013) . An additional trial comparing the combination to each monothera py evaluated secondary efficacy endpoints and safety over 6 months. The combi nation of brinzolamide/brimonidine had higher rates o f adverse events and discontinuation rates. The mean IO P reductions after 6 months w ere similar to those observed after 3 months (Whitson et al 2013) . Another trial evaluating twice daily dosing was conducted aft er the US approval of the thrice daily dosing. Results were similar to those previously observed (Aung et al 2014) . In another trial, compared with dorzolamide/timolol, brinzolami de/brimonidine provided signi ficantly greater morning 2017) . / Cosopt PF (dorzolamide/timolol) a study comparing dorzolamide/timolol to the individual comp onents, the combination prod uct was more effective at reducing IOP from base line at all time periods over 3 months of treatment (Clineschmidt et al 1998) . 160 Data as of January 24, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/KMR Page 11 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. One open-label study evaluated t he safety and efficacy of dorzo lamide/timolol preservative-free formulation (Renieri et al 2010). Patients receiving the preserva tive-free product experienced a statistically signifi cant reduction in IOP from baseline (p value not repor ted). Local tolerability improv ed in 79.3% of patients who switched to this formulation from other anti-glau coma therapies. Of not e, 84% of patients sw itching from Cosopt experienced an improvement in tolerability with the was compared to brimonidine/timolo l, and both demonstrated significant reductions in IOP from baseline. The differenc es between groups were not foun d to be significant in any of the 3 studies (p value not reported) (Gulkilik et al 2011, Martinez et al 2010, Siesky et al 2012) . However, 2 other studies had conflicting findings. In a crossover study o f 20 patients, brimonidine/timo lol had significantly lower mean diurnal IOP than dorzolamide/timolol after 6 week s (16.28 vs 17.23 mmHg, respect ively; p = 0.03) (Garcia-Feijoo et al 2010) . In a crossover study of 77 patients, dorzolamide/timolol was associa ted with a greater reduct ion in the mean 24-hour IOP level from baseline, c ompared to brimonidine/timolol (mean diff erence, 0.7 mmHg; p < 0.0 01). Likewise, the peak and minimum 24-hour IOP levels were significantly lower with dorzol amide/timolol compared to brimonidine/timolol (p = 0.03 and p = 0.012, respectively) (Konstas et al 2012). It is not clear how population size and duration of the crossover studies affected these results. CLINICAL GUIDELINES American Optometric Association (AOA) - Care of the Patient wit h Open Angle Glaucoma (AOA 2010 ) The 2010 AOA guideline (currently under review) provides a summ ary of the efficacy and adver se effects for the various classes of pharmacologic therap y for open angle glaucoma, but does not specifically recomm end 1 class over another. Combination therapy can be consi dered in patient s who have not achieved optimal IOP reduct ion with a prostaglandin analogue. American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) - Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (Prum et al 2016) Medical therapy is presently the most common initial intervention to lower IOP. There are many drugs available for initial therapy, and medication choice m ay be influenced by potential c ost, side effects, dosing sc hedules, and the degree of IOP lowering needed. Prostaglandin analogue s are the most frequent ly used initial ey e drops for lowering IOP. They are the most efficacious drugs for lowering IOP, and they are relatively safe. They are, therefore, often considered as initial medical therapy unless other considerations suc h as contraindications, cost, si de effects, intolerance, or pat ient refusal preclude their use. Other agents include beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, ROCK inhibi tors, topical and oral carbonic and parasympathomimetics. The AAO guidelines do not recom mend 1 ophthalmic prostaglandin analogue over another. If a single medication is effect ive in lowering IOP but the tar get IOP is not reached, combina tion therapy or switching to an alternative therapy may be appropriate. Similarly, if a drug fails to reduce IOP sufficiently despite good adherence to therapy, it can be replaced wit h an alternativ e agent until eff ective medical treatment, whethe r alone or in combination, is established. AAO - Esotropia and Exotropia Preferred Practice Pattern for esotropia and ex otropia from the AAO note that c holinesterase inhibitors such as echothiophate iodide reduce accommodative effort and convergence by contraction ( AAO 2017 ). Echothiophate iodide is among several treatment options that also include corrective lenses, bifocals, p rism therapy, botulinum toxin injection, and extraocular muscle surgery. Echothiophate iodide, in the long term, is less desirable than using corrective lenses because of systemic adverse effects such as diarrhea, asthm a, and/or increased salivation a nd perspiration. 161 Data as of January 24, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/KMR Page 12 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

SAFETY SUMMARY Contraindications Alpha-agonists are contraindicate d in patients who have hyperse nsitivity to the ingredients or clonidine (apraclonidine). Products containing apraclonidine are contraindicated in patients receiving oxidase inhibitors. Products containing brimonidine are contraindicated in neonates and infants < 2 years of age. Ophthalmic beta-blockers (as si ngle entity agents or in combinations) are contraindicated in patients with a history of bronchial asthma or severe chr onic obstructive pulmonary diseas e, cardiogenic shock, sec ond or third degree atrio- ventricular block, sinus bradyca rdia, overt cardiac failure, an d known hypersensitivity to any component of the product. Echothiophate iodide is contraindi cated in acute uveitis, known hypersensitivity to echothio phate iodide or any component of th e formulation. Alpha-agonists may potentiate syndr omes associated with vascular insufficiency and should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disease, depression, cerebr al or coronary si ngle entity or in combinations, may mask signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia; use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus. Ophthalmic beta-blockers may caus e systemic adver se events incl uding cardiovascular and respiratory adverse events. Due to the potential for system ic effects with ophthalmic timol ol use, exercise caution in patients with cardiac disease, diabetes, and anaphylact ic reactions, as beta-blockers may alter response. Warnings for the carbonic anhydras e inhibitors include the risk of corneal edema, bacterial keratitis, ocular adverse effects, and sulfonamide hypersensitivity. Oral and ophthalmic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors should not be used concurrently due to t he possibility of additive systemic effects. Due to the brinzolamide componen t, Simbrinza labeling contains warnings for sulfonamide hypersensitivity reactions, and corneal edema in patients with low endothelial c ell counts. Miotics The miosis caused by the ophthalmi c miotics usually causes diff iculty in dark adaptation; t herefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution in night driving and other hazar dous occupations i n poor illumination. Rare cases of retinal detachmen t have been reported when used i n certain susceptible pat ients and those with pre- existing retinal disease; theref ore, a thorough examination of the retina, including f unduscopy, is advised in all patients prior to the initiation of ophthalmic miotics. Caution is advised when administ ering ophthalmic pilocarpine solution for control of IOP in pediatric patients with primary congenital glaucoma. Caution should be exer cised when administering echothiophate iodide in patients with disorders that may respond adversely due to the potenti al for vagotonic effects. Great caution should be used when administering other cholinest erase inhibitors (ie, succinylcholine), or with exposure to organophosphate or carbamate insecticides, at any t ime in patients receiving anticholinesterase medications including echothioph ate iodide. Respiratory or card iovascular collapse may occur. Use caution when treating glaucoma with echothioph ate iodide in patients receiving systemic anticholinesterase medications for myasthenia gravis due to the risk of possible additive effects. Patients with active or a h istory of quiescent uveitis should consider avoiding echot hiophate iodide. If used with cau tion, there is a potential fo r intense and persistent miosis and ciliary muscle contraction. If cardiac irregularities occur with echothiophat e iodide use, temporary or permanent discontinuation is recommended. If salivation, urinary incontinen ce, diarrhea, profuse sweating , muscle weakness, or respiratory difficulties occur with echothiophate iodide use, te mporary discontinuation of the medication is recommended. Prostaglandin analogue class warnings include the risk of hyper pigmentation of ocular ti ssues and eyelash changes with darkening and thickening of eyelashes. Drugs in this class should be used with caut ion in patients with intraocular inflammation or macular edema. 162 Data as of January 24, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/KMR Page 13 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

ROCK inhibitor Bacterial keratitis: There have been reports of bacterial kerat itis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products . These containers had been inadv ertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal d isease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. Adverse reactions Alpha-Agonists The most common adverse events (5 to 20% of patients) with brim onidine included allergic conjunctivitis, burning conjuncti hyperemia, e ye pruritus, hypertension, ocu lar allergic reaction, oral dryness, and visual disturbance. Common adverse events (5 to 15% of patients) with apraclonidine included ocular discomfort, ocular hyperemia, ocular pruritus, and dry The can potentially cause systemic adverse effec ts including somnolence and dizziness. Beta-blockers Local ocular adverse events reported with ophthalmic beta-block ers include blurred vision and instillation reactions (itching, burning, tearing). Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Adverse events are primarily lim ited to local ocular effects including blurred vision, conj anhydrase i nhibitors also are associated with alterations of taste wh ich have been reported in up to 30% of patients. Miotics Most adverse events reported with the miotics are associated wi th the eye. Visual blurring , burning, eye irritation, and eye pain have been reported. Prostaglandin Analogues The most frequently rep orted adverse events associated with the se agents are ocular in nature and include burning/stinging, hyperemia, pruritus, iris pigmentation change s, and growth and darkening of eyelashes. ROCK inhibitor The most common adverse event wit h Rhopressa was conjunctival h yperemia (53%). Other common (approximately 20%) ocular adverse reactions reported were corn eal verticillata, instillation site pain, and conjunctival hemorrh age. erythema of eyelid, and reduced visual acuity were reported in 5 to 10% of patients. Corneal verticillata occurred in approximately 20% of the pati ents in controlled clinical studies. The corneal verticillata seen in Rhopressa-t reated patients were first note d at 4 weeks of daily dosi ng. This reaction did not result in any apparent visual functional changes in patients. M ost corneal verticillata resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. Drug interactions Alpha-agonists may reduce pulse and blood pressure when adminis tered with antihypertensives. When used with central nervous system depress ants, alpha-agonists may have an additive or potentiating effect. Tricyclic antidepressants have been report ed to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine; i t is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents wi th ophthalmic alpha-agonists c an interfere with their IOP-lowering effect. Concomitant therapy of brimonidi ne and monoamine oxidase inhibi tors may result Drug interactions with ophthalmic beta-blockers include the potentiation of the effects of c alcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, clonidine, and qui nidine on the cardiovascular system. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION See the current prescribing information for full details. In general, patients should remove their contact lenses prior t o the instillation of o phthalmic products. 163 Data as of January 24, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/KMR Page 14 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CONCLUSION Treatment of glaucoma currently focuses on decreasing IOP by 1 of 3 methods: laser therapy, surgery, or medical intervention (Prum et al 2016) . There are no standard guidelines for a target IOP ( Jacobs 2018[b] ). Medical intervention includes 6 classes of ophthalmic agents used for the long-term management of glaucoma: blockers, carbonic anhydr ase inhibitors, miotics, prostaglandin analogues, and ROCK inhibitors. Guidelines published in 2010 by the AOA (currently under r eview per the AOA website) do not recommend preferential use of any drug class, 168 Data as of January 24, 2019 KS-U/MG-U/KMR Page 19 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Combination therapy with agents fr om other therapeutic classes should be used if the reduction in IOP on monotherapy is unsatisfactory (AOA 2010, Prum et al 2016) . Combination therapy can be given as separate drops or in fixed dose combinations which include brimonidine/timolol, brimonidine/brinzolamide, and dorzolamide/timolol. Adherence is often poor with glau coma treatment as the disease is asymptomatic for many years, and eye drops may be difficult to use or cause adverse effects ( Jacobs 2018[b] ). The AAO and AOA guidelines hav e not been updated to include Xel pros (latanoprost ophthalmic emulsion) or the 2016 AAO guideline s was issued in 2018 to acknowledge the use of ROCK inhibitors for reduction of IOP; no specific agents are mentioned in the update. Among the ophthalmic prostaglandin analogues, studies have demonstrated statistically signi ficant differences in IOP- lowering ability among agents in the class. However, the differ ences are generally small, and the clinical significance of these differences has not been es tablished. Bimatoprost is gene rally considered to have the greatest IOP-reducing effect among the ophthalmic prostaglandin analogues (Aptel et al 2008, Cheng et al 2008, Kammer et al 2010, Li et al 2016, Lin et al 2014, Weinreb et al 2018) . In addition to conjunctival hyperemia, ocular adverse events with the prostaglandin analogue s include eye irritation, increase in the number and lengt h of eyelashes, and changes in iris and lash pigmentati on; the latter 2 are most notable if only 1 eye is treated. The ophthalmic prostaglandin analogues are considered to be better tolerated compared to other classes of medications used for the managemen t of glaucoma (Jacobs 2018[b]) . Several ophthalmic agents in these drug classes are used for ot her indications. Ophthalmi c apraclonidine 1% is FDA- approved to control or prevent pos tsurgical elevations in IOP, while ophthalmic apraclonidine 0. 5% is indicated as short- term adjunctive therapy in pati ents on maximally tolerated medi cal therapy who require additional IOP reduction. Ophthalmic pilocarpine is indic ated prevention of postoperative elevated IOP associ ated with laser surgery, and reduction of elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The ophthalmic miotics are an establis hed treatment option as t hey have been available since the 1960s.

Therapeutic Class Overview Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Agents INTRODUCTION Attention-deficit/hyperactivity d isorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder among children, with an estimated prevalence of up to 10% of school-age children in the United States (U.S.). It is more common in boys than girls and frequently persists into adulthood ( Feldman et al 2014 ). Epidemiologic studies of adult ADHD have estimated the current prevalence to be 4.4% in the U.S. ( Bukstein 2018 ). o In children, this chronic disord er is characterized by symptom s of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention. These symptoms affect cognitive, academic, behavioral, emotional, and social functioning ( Krull 2019a ). Common comorbid psychiatric disorders include oppositional defiant dis order, conduct disorder, depr ession, anxiety disorder, and learning disabilities ( Krull 2019b ). Approximately 20% of children with ADHD develop chronic tic disorders and approximately 50% of children with chronic tics or Tourette syndrome have comorbid ADHD ( Krull 2018 ). o ADHD in adults by symptoms of inattention, im pulsivity, and restlessness . Impairment in executive function and emotional dysregulat ion frequently occur. Common c omorbid psychiatric disorders include mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorder, and intermittent exp losive disorder ( Bukstein 2018 ). For children < 17 years of age, the Diagnos tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of ADHD requires 6 sy mptoms of hyperactivity and im pulsivity or 6 symptoms of inattention. For adolescents 17 years of age and adults, 5 symptoms of hyper activity and impulsivity or 5 symptoms of inattention are required. o The symptoms of hyperactivity/im pulsivity or inattention must occur often; be present in more than 1 setting; persist for at least 6 months; be presen t before the age of 12 years; impair function in academic, social, or occupational activities; and be excessive for the developmental level of the child. o Other physical, situational, or mental health conditions that could account for the symp toms must be excluded. Treatment of ADHD may involve behavioral/psychologic interventi ons, medication, and/or educational interventions, alone or in combination (Krull 2019c ). o For preschool children (age 4 th rough 5 years), behavioral the rapy is considered the first-line treatment; when medication is necessary, methyl phenidate is generally recommend ed. o For children and adolescents wi th mode rate to severe ADHD, med ic ation and behavioral therapy are recommended. In general, stimulant s are the first-line agents; however, non-stimulant medications may be more appropriate for certain children. About 30% of patients do not respond to or may not tolerate the initial stimulant treatment. At least one-half of children who do not respond to one type of stimulant will respo nd to the other. If there is s till no improvement, consideration should be given to switching to or adding a non-s timulant ADHD medication ( Pharmacist's Letter 2015, Krull 2019d ). Multiple agents are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for t he treatment of ADHD. They include central nervous system (CNS) stimulants (amphetamine- and methylphenidate-based fo ER) and guanfacine ER. Due to the potential for abuse , the stimulant agents are classi fied as Schedule II controlled substances. Several stimulants are also appr oved for the treatment of narcolepsy and exogenous obesity; t he use of stimulants for the treatment of obesity will no t be covered in this review. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of bi nge eating disorder (BED). In August of 2018, an extended-relea se methylphenidate capsule (Jornay PM) was approved by the FDA. In addition, an orally disintegrating amphetamine sulfate tablet (Evekeo ODT) was also approved in late January 2019. Launch dates have not yet been announced for either product.

Food and Drug Admini stration Approved Indications Indication Evekeo (amphetamine sulfate) as an integral part of a total treatment program which typically includes other remedial measures (psychological, educational, and social) for a stabilizing effect in pediatric patie nts with a behavioral syndrome characterized by the following group of development ally inappropriate symptoms: moderate to severe distractibility, sho rt attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. The diagnosis of this syndrome should not be made with finality when these symptoms are only of comparatively recent origin. Nonlocalizing (soft) neurological signs, learning disability, and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) may or may not be present, and a diagnosis of CNS dysfunction may or may not be warranted.* Treatment of ADHD as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to stimulant medications Narcolepsy** Exogenous obesity, as a short term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on calo ric restriction for patients refractory to alternative therapy 176 Data as of February 22, 2019 JZ-U/SS-U/AVD Page 4 of 19 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Daytrana, Desoxyn, Dexedrine Spansule, Dyanavel XR, Intuniv, and Kapvay a re approved for use in children 6 years of age and older. Adderall Strattera, and Vyvanse are approved for us e in patients 6 years of age and older. Cotempla XR-ODT and Evekeo ODT are approved for use in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age. Concerta is a pproved for use in children 6 years of age and older, adolescents, and adults up to 65 year s of age. Mydayis is approved fo r use in patients 13 years of age and older. **These drugs are approved for us e in patients 6 years of age a nd older. These drugs are not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age for treatment of exogenous obesity. The limited usefulness of these produ cts should be weighed against possible risks inherent in use of the drugs. Limitation of use: Lisdexamfetamine: Lisdexamfetamine is not indicated or recommen ded for weight loss. Use of other sympathomimetic drugs for weight loss has been associated with serious cardiovascular (CV ) adverse events (AEs). The safety and effectiveness of th is drug for the treatment of obesity have not been established. Mydayis: Pediatric patients 12 y ears and younger experienced h igher plasma exposure than patients 13 years and older at the same dose and experie nced higher rates of AEs, mai nly insomnia and decreased appetite. Information on indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, dosing, and safety has been obtained from the prescribing information for the individual products, except whe re noted otherwise. CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Randomized trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have found stimulants, atomoxetine, and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists to be more efficacious than placebo in reducing the co re symptoms of ADHD in c hildren and adolescents . Adzenys ER, an amphetamine ER oral suspension, was approved under the 505(b)(2) regul atory pathway and was found to be bioequivalent to Addera ll XR. No clinical efficacy studies were conducted. Evekeo ODT, an orally disintegr ating amphetamine tablet, was ap proved under the 505(b)(2 ) regulatory pathway. The safety and effectiveness of Evekeo ODT for the treatment of ADHD was established bas ed on an adequate and well- controlled study of Evek eo (amphetamine sulfate). Cotempla XR-ODT, a new methylpheni date ER orally disintegrating tablet formulation, was approved based on a randomized, double-blind (DB), et al 2017 ) (N = 87) which found that the av erage Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP)-Combined score was significantly better fo r Cotempla XR-ODT than for placebo (least squares [LS] mean 14.3 [95% CI, 12.2 to 16.4] vs 25.3 [9% CI, 23.0 to 27. 6], respectively, p < 0.0001). Jornay PM, an ER methylphenidate capsule formulation, was appro ved based on the results of 2 clinical studies conducted in patients 6 to 12 years of age with ADHD: The first study was a 6-week op en-label (OL) dose-optimization study, followed by a 1-week DB, PC withdrawal phase where patients were randomi zed to continue treatment with Jornay PM or switch to placebo ( Jornay PM Prescribing Information 2018). The study, which was conducted in an analog classroom settin g and included 117 children aged 6 to 12 years, found that Jornay PM was associate d with a significant reduction in the SKAMP symptom score over a 12-hour per iod (difference in least square s [LS] mean -5.9; 95% CI, -9.1 to -2.7).

A randomized, DB, MC, PC, paralle l group, forced-dose titration trial conducted over 3 weeks in 161 children 6 to 12 years of age with ADHD ( Pliszka et al 2017 ). The study found that 40 to 80 mg/day of Jornay PM achieved significant improvements vs place bo in ADHD symptoms (LS mean A DHD rating scale-IV 24. 1 vs 31.2; p = 0.002) at 3 weeks. Significant improveme nts were also seen vs placebo in key secondary outco mes including at-home early morning and late afternoon/ evening functional impairment at 3 weeks. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent AEs were in somnia and decreased appetite. Mydayis, a new mixed amphetamine salts product, was approved fo r the treatment of ADHD based on the results of 5 MC, DB, PC, randomized controlle d trials (RCTs): 3 in adults an d 2 in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age. The studies found that Mydayis demonstrated a statistically signifi cant treatment effect compared with placebo on various ADHD outcomes measures (eg, ADHD -Rating Scale [ADHD-RS] score, ( Mydayis Prescribing Information 2017, Weisler et al 2017) (see results below i n Table 3 below).

However, the evidence was o f low quality. An RCT called the Preschool A DHD Treatment Study (PATS) ( Greenhill et al 2006 ) evaluated the efficacy of methylphenidate immediate-release (IR) in 303 preschool childre n with ADHD and found that it demonstrated significant reductions on ADHD symptom scales; however, the eff ect sizes (0.4 to 0.8) were smaller than those generally reported for school-age children. A systematic (Cochrane) r eview of 23 PC, RCTs ( Punja et al 2016 ) (N = 2675) found that amphetamines were effective at improving the core s ymptoms of ADHD, but they were also associated with a hig her risk of AEs compared to placebo. There was no eviden ce that one kind of amphetamine was better than another and there was no difference between short-acting and long-acting formulations. A meta-analysis of 25 DB, PC, RCTs (Schwartz et al 2014) (N = 3928) in children and adolescents with ADHD found atomoxetine to be superior to placebo for overall ADHD symptoms, with a medium effect size (-0.64). 178 Data as of February 22, 2019 JZ-U/SS-U/AVD Page 6 of 19 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. A meta-analysis of 12 RCTs ( Hirota et al 2014 ) (N = 2276) in pediatric patie nts with ADHD found that alpha 2- adrenergic agonists were signifi cantly superior to placebo for overall ADHD symptoms bot h as monotherapy and, to a lesser extent, as augmentati on therapy to stimulants. Meta-analytic results failed to demonstrate a significant diffe rence in efficacy between alpha 2-adrenergic agonists. In sub-analyses of individual formulations, the ER formulations separated robustly from placebo whereas the IR formulations did not separate from placebo. A systematic review of 16 RCTs and 1 meta-analysis ( Chan et al 2016 ) (N = 2668) found evidence supporting the use of methylphenidate ER and amphetamine ER formulations, atomoxet ine, and guanfacine ER for the treatment of ADHD in adolescents. For the prim ary outcome measure of mean ch ange in ADHD-RS total symptom score, both stimulant and non-stimulant medica tions led to clinically signi ficant reductions of 14. 93 to 24.60 points. For the treatment of ADHD in chi ldren and adolescents, stimulan ts typically have a slightly l arger treatment effect size (standardized mean difference [S MD]) than non-stimulants (approximately 1.0 vs approximately 0.7 for both atomoxetine and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists). However, there is insufficient evidence to definitively concl ude that one stimulant is more efficacious than another ( Krull 2019d , AAP 2011). An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) review of 78 studies (Jadad et al 1999 ) evaluating the efficacy of various interventi ons for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults found few, if any, differences between methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine. A meta-analysis of 23 DB, PC Faraone 2010a ) comparing the efficacy of methylphenidate and amphetamine formulations found that amphetamine products may be moderately more efficacious than methylphenidate products. A DB, PC, RCT ( Newcorn et al 2008 ) (N = 516) comparing the efficacy of atomoxetine vs methylphen idate ER (osmotic-release formulation) i n patients 6 to 16 years of age with ADHD found that both drugs were superior to placebo in terms of response rate , and that methylphenidate ER was superior to atomoxetine. A meta-analysis of 29 DB, PC trials ( Faraone et al 2006 ) evaluated the efficacy of various medications (methylphenidate and amphetamine compounds, atomoxetine, pemoli ne [no longer available in the U.S.], bupropion, and modafinil) for the treatment of ADHD. The effect sizes for non-stimulant medications wer e significantly less than those for IR stimulants or long-ac ting stimulants. The 2 classe s of stimulant medications did not differ significantly from one another. A meta-analysis of 28 DB, PC, RCTs (Stuhec et al 2015 ) (N = 4699) compared the efficacy of various medications for the treatment of ADHD in childre n and adolescents. Efficacy in reducing ADHD symptoms c ompared to placebo was small for bupropion (SMD = -0.32 ; 95% confidence interval -1.84 to -0.71). A meta-analysis and mixed treatment comparison of 36 RC Ts (Joseph et al 2017 ) evaluating the comparative efficacy and safety of ADHD pharmacotherapies in ch ildren and adolescents found guanfacine ER, atomo ER had a high posterior probabilit y of being more efficacious than atomoxetine, but their credi ble intervals overlapped. A network meta-analysis of 48 DB, RCTs ( Padilha et al 2018) compared the safety and efficacy of various ADHD medications in children and adolescents. Of the 12 trials that were evaluated for efficacy, analysis was performed using the Clinical Global Impre ssion Improvement (CGI-I) scale for 3 drugs, which showed that methylphenidate was more effective than atomoxetine (MD, 3.15; 95% CI, 0.75 to 13.7 1) and guanfacine (MD, 1.9 2; 95% CI, 0.64 to 5.94). Thirty-three trials were evaluat ed for safety. Ranking of AEs s howed that lisdexamfetamine was more likely to cause sleep disorders, loss of appet ite, and behavior problems compared to other treatments. Alpha 2-adrenergic agonists have been as sociated with improvements in ADHD symptoms and comorbid tics. A meta-analysis of 9 DB, PC, RCTs ( Bloch et al 2009 ) (N = 477) was conducted to det ermine the relative efficacy of different medications in treating ADHD and tic symptoms in chil dren with both Tourette syndrome and ADHD. Methylphenidate seemed to offer t he greatest improvement of ADH D symptoms and did not seem to worsen tic symptoms. Alpha 2-adrenergic agonists offered t he best combined improvement in b oth tic and ADHD symptoms. Atomoxetine significantly impro ved both tic and ADHD severity c ompared to placebo. One small study found that tic se verity was significantly increased with higher doses of dextroamphetamine treatment. A Cochrane review of 8 RCTs ( Osland et al 2018 ) including 510 children with both ADHD and a chronic tic disor der found low-quality evidence for im provement of ADHD symptoms wit h methylphenidate, atomoxetine, and evidence for desipramine, improved with desipramine, methylphenidate, clonidi ne, and a combination of methylphenidate and 179 Data as of February 22, 2019 JZ-U/SS-U/AVD Page 7 of 19 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The authors noted that in 1 study wit h a short durat ion (3 weeks), high doses of dextroamphetamine worsened tics. There are limited efficacy data regarding the treatment of ADHD in the adult population. Comparison of effect sizes in clinical trials suggests that sti mulant medications are more ef ficacious in adult ADHD than non-stimulants. In a meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials ( Cunill et al 2009 ) (N = 3375) comparing atomo xetine with placebo in adult ADHD, atomoxetine led to a modestly greater reduction in ADHD s ymptom severity, but was associated with higher all-cause A meta-analysis ( Faraone 2010b ) of 19 randomized trials of 13 medications for adult ADHD found a greater average effect size for reduction in ADH D symptoms in patients receiving short- and long-acting stimulant medications (vs placebo; 0.86 and 0.73, respective ly) compared with patients re ceiving non-stimulant medication (vs placebo; 0.39). No difference in effect size wa s found between short- and long- acting stimulants. A meta-analysis of 20 randomized trials ( Stuhec et 2018 compared amphetamin methylphenidate, and modafinil in the treatment of ADHD in adults. The highest effect size in reducing ADHD symptoms was found with li sdexamfetamine (SMD -0.89; 95% CI, -1.09 to -0.70), while moderate reductions in symptoms were seen with mi xed amphetamine salts (SMD No efficacy was reported with modafinil. A Cochrane review of 19 studies ( Castells et 2018 , N = 2521) comparing dextroamph etamine, lisdexamfetamine, and mixed amphetamine salts for t he treatment of ADHD in adults found that overall, amphetamines reduced the patient- and clinician-rated seve rity of ADHD symptoms compared to placebo; however, t hey did not improve retention in treatment. Amphetamin es were associ ated with an increased proportion of patients who withdrew because of AEs. When co mparing different types of amphetamines, lisdexamfetamine and mi xed amphetamine salts reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians, b ut dextroamphetamine did not. No differences in any outcome were found when comparing immediate- and sustained-rele ase formulations. Another meta-analysis ( Cortese et al 2018 ) of 133 treatment of ADHD found that all drugs were superior to placebo for ADHD core symptoms as rated by clinicia ns in children and adolescents, and all drugs except for modafinil were more efficacious than placebo in adults. When comparing the various drugs based on teachers' ratings in children and adolescents, only methylphenidate and modafinil were found to be more efficacious than placebo. In head-to-head comparisons, diffe rences in efficacy based on c linicians' were favoring amphetamines 5) children and adolesc ents. Efficacy results based on clinicians' ratings were similar for adults, and favor ed amphetamines -0.05). emonstrated efficacy in the tr eatment of BED. Direct com parison trials between lisdexamfetamine and other drugs used off-label to treat BED ar e lacking. In 2 Phase 3, 12-week, ran domized, DB, PC trials ( McElroy et al 2016 ) (N = 773) in patients with moderate to severe BED, lisdexamfetamine-treated patients had a statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline in mean number of binge days per week at w eek 12 vs placebo (treatment difference in study 1: -1.35 [-1.70 to -1.01]; study 2: -1.66 [-2.04 to -1.28]; < 0.001). A extension study ( Gasior et al 2017 ) (N = 599) in adults with BED found that the long-term safety and tolerability of lisdexamfeta mine were generally consistent with the safety profile obs erved in 3 previous short- term trials in BED as well as i ts established profile for ADHD. Common treatment-emergent AEs included dry mouth, headache, insomnia, and upp er respiratory tract infectio n. Weight loss and increases in blood pressure and pulse rate were also observed. In a phase 3, DB, randomiz ed, PC, withdrawal study ( Hudson et al 2017 ) (N = 418) in adults with moderate to severe BED, responders to lisdexamfetami ne during a 12-week OL phase w ere randomized to placebo or continued lisdexamfetamine during a 26-week , DB phase. The percentage of patients meeting relapse criteria was 3.7% with lisdexamfetamine vs 32.1% with time statist ically favored lisdexamfe tamine (p < 0.001). The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.0 9 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.23). A systematic review and meta-ana lysis of 9 waitlist-controlled psychological trials and 25 PC trials evaluating pharmacologic (n = 19) or combination (n = 6) treatment for BED (Brownley et al 2016 ) found that increased binge-eating abs tinence (relative risk 180 Data as of February 22, 2019 JZ-U/SS-U/AVD Page 8 of 19 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

[RR], 4.95 [95% while lisdexamfetamine and SGAs frequency (mea difference 09], respectively). Topiramate and other forms of CBT also increased abstinence and reduced binge-eating frequency. A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis of 45 RCTs ( Ghaderi et al 2018 ) compared various psychological, pharmacological, and combined treatments for BED, and found mod erate support for the e fficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and CBT- guided self-help (moderate quality of evidence), and low quality evidence to support interpersonal psychotherapy , selective serotonin reupta ke inhibitors, and lisdexamfetamine for the cessation of or reduction in the frequenc y of binge eating. Only lisdexam fetamine showed a modest effect on weight loss (SMD for body mass index -5.23 ; 95% CI, -6.52 to -3.94). CLINICAL GUIDELINES ADHD Several clinical guidelines have provided recommendations on th e treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents. According to the American Acade my of Pediatrics (AAP) guideline s (2011), the evidence is particularly strong for stimulant medications, and suffi cient but less strong for atomo xetine, guanfacine ER, and clonidine ER (in that order). Guanfacine ER and clonidine ER have evidence to support their use as adjunctive ther apy with stimulant medications. Methylphenidate is recommended for preschool-aged children who have had an inadequate response to behavioral interventions. The American Academy of Child a nd Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) guidelines ( Pliszka et al 2007 ) state that both methylphenidate and amphetamines are equally efficacious in the treatment of ADHD. The long-acting formulations are equally efficacious as the IR formulations and may be used as initial therapy. Short-acting stimulants are often used as initial treatment in small children (< 16 kg in weight) , for whom there are no long-a cting preparations in a sufficiently low dose. Some pati ents may respond similarly to d ifferent stimulant classes , whereas other patients may respond preferentially to only 1 of the classes of stimulants. Although stimulants have demon strated greater efficacy compared to atomoxetine in published studies, atomoxetine may b e used first-line in patients with an active substance abuse problem, comorbid anxiety or tics, and in those who experience severe AEs with stimulants. The Medical Letter (2015) recommends that treatment of ADHD in school-age children or adults should begin with an oral stimulant, either a methyl phenidate- or amphetamine-based formulation. Mixing short- and long-acting stimulants can be helpful to achieve an i mmediate effect for early-morning school classes or for redu cing rebound irritability or overactivity, especially in the evening. An ER alpha 2-adrenergic agonist may be helpfu l as adjunctive therapy with a stimulant in patients who canno t tolerate usual doses of the st imulant, particularly those with tics. Atomoxetine is an alternative for patients who c annot tolerate stimulants or for whom treatment with a controlled substance is undesirable. The AACAP practice parameter fo r the treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders (2013) states that alpha 2-adrenergic agonists have demonst rated an effect size of 0.5 fo r the amelioration of tics and may be preferred by some prescribers over antip sychotics due to their relatively favorable AE profile. Narcolepsy The American Academy of Sleep M edicine (AASM) practice paramete rs (Morgenthaler et al 2007 ) recommend various drugs for the treatment of daytime sleepiness due to narcolepsy including modafinil (high deg certainty); amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methylphen idate (moderate degree of clinical certainty); sodium oxybate (high degree of c linical certainty ); and selegil ine (uncertain clinical certainty). BED According the American Psychiatri c Association ( APA) practice g uidelines on eating disorders (Yager et al 2006 , Yager et al 2012 [guideline watch update]), treatm ent of BED may include the fo llowing: o Nutritional rehabilit ation and counseling o Psychosocial treatment CBT, behavior therapy, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and interpersonal therapy (IPT) have all been associated with binge frequency re duction rates of 67% or more and significant abstinence rates during active treatment. Self-help programs using self-gui ded, professionally designed m anuals have been effect ive in reducing the symptoms of BED in the short-run for some patients and may have long-term benefit. o Medications 181 Data as of February 22, 2019 JZ-U/SS-U/AVD Page 9 of 19 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Antidepressant treatmen t is associated with short-term reductio ns in binge-eating but generally does not result in substantial weight loss. Selecti ve serotonin reuptake inhibitor s (SSRIs) have the fewest d ifficulties with AEs and the most evidence for efficacy when used at the high end of the recommended dose range. Topiramate can reduce bingeing and decrease weight, but its use may be limited by AEs. o Combination psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy For most patients, adding antidepressant therapy to a behaviora l weight control and/or CBT regimen does not have a significant effect on binge suppression. Although limited evidence is avail able, combined treatment is frequently used in clinical practice. The American Association of Clin ical Endocrinologists and the A merican College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE) guidelines for medical care o f patients with obesity ( Garvey et al 2016 ) recommend the following for patients with overweight or obesity who have BED: o Patients should be treated with a structured behavioral/lifestyle program, combined with CBT or other psychological interventions o Treatment with orlistat or approved medications containing top iramate or bupropion may be considered in conjunction with structured lif estyle therapy, CBT, and/or psychological interventions The Task Force on Eating Disorder s of the World Federation of S ocieties of Biological Psychiatry ( Aigner et al 2011 ) concluded that for the treatment of BED, grade A evidence suppo rts the use of imipramine (m oderate risk-benef sertraline (good risk-benefit ratio), citalopram/escitalopram ( good risk-benefit ratio), orl istat (low to moderate risk- benefit ratio), and topiramate (mo derate risk-benefit ratio). Atomoxetine has grade B evi dence supporting its use. SAFETY SUMMARY Due to the potential for abuse, t he stimulants ar e classified a s Schedule II controlled substanc es. Atomoxetine, clonidine ER, and guanfacine ER are not cla ssified as controlled substanc es. Various stimulants are contraindicated for use in patients with advanced arteriosclerosis , symptomatic CV disease, moderate to severe hypertension , hyperthyroidism, hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines, glaucoma, agitated states, history of drug abuse, ti cs, and in those using monoami ne oxidase inhibitors (MAOI s). The stimulants carry a boxed warning for potential drug abuse and dependence. They als o have warnings for increa sed risks of serious CV reactions, psychiatric AEs, suppression of growth, peripheral vasculopathy, and priapism . Amphetamines have a warning for risk of serotonin syndrome when used in combination with other drugs affecting the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. Common AEs of stimulants include anorexia, decreased weight, tachycardia, anxiety, irri tability, and insomnia. Refer to the prescribing inform ation for details on warnings, p recautions, and AEs for individual products. For example: QuilliChew ER can be harmful to patients with phe nylketonuria ( PKU) since it contains phenylalanine. Because the Concerta tablet is nondeformable and does not appre ciably change in shape in the gastrointestinal tract, it should not ordinarily be administered to patients wit h preexisting severe gastr ointestinal narrowing. The use of Daytrana may i n chemical leuko derma and conta ct sensitization; in addi tion, exposure of the application site to external heat sources should be avoided due to increased absorption of the drug. Atomoxetine is contraindicated fo r use in patient s with narrow angle glaucoma, pheochromocytoma, severe CV disorders, hypersensitivity to any component of the product, an d in those taking MAOIs. It car ries a boxed warning for rare increased risk of suicidal ideation in children and adolescents. It also has warnings for serious CV events, effects on blood pressure and heart rate, effe cts on growth, psychiatric A Es, rare cases of severe liver injury, and priapism. Common AEs associated with atomo xetine include somnolence, agonists are contrai ndicated in patients known to b e hypersensitive to any constituent of the product. They carry warnings for increased risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope; sedation and somnolence; rebound hypertension; c conduction abnormalities. Common AEs associated with cloni dine ER include somnolence, fat igue, and irritability while common AEs with guanfacine ER include somnolen ce, fatigue, and hypotension.

See the current prescribing in formation for full details *References: Prescribing information for individual products, Medical Letter 2015, Pharmacist's Letter 2016, Krull 2019d CONCLUSION Both CNS stimulants and non-stimulants may be used for the treatment of ADHD. In general, sti mulants are first-line treatment due to their superior efficacy. Clinical evidence sug gests that methylphenidate an d amphetamines are equally efficacious, but some patients may respond to one stimulant and not the other. Various short- , intermediate- and long- acting formulations (eg, tablets/ capsules, chewable/orally disintegrating tablets, solution/ suspension, transdermal patch) are available to provide a r ange of dosing options. Although no n-stimulants such as atomoxetine and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists have smaller effect sizes, they may be used in patient s who have failed or are int olerant to stimulants or when there is concern about possibl e abuse or diversion. The alpha 2-adrenergic agonists are app roved both as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to stim ulants, and they have been sho wn to improve both tic and ADHD symptoms in patients with comorbid tic disorder. Current consensus clinical guide lines for the treatment of chil dren and adolescents with ADHD recommend that stimulants are highly effective for reducing core symptoms of A DHD in children (AACAP 2007 ; AAP 2011 ). Ultimately, the choice of the initial agent for treatment of AD HD depends upon various factor s such as: duration of desired coverage; ability of the child to swallow pills; coexis ting tic disorder (use of alpha 2-adrenergic agonists may be warranted); potential AEs, history of substance abuse in the patient or household member (eg, avoid stimulants or use stimulants with less potential for abuse [eg, lisdexamfetamine, osmotic-release preparation, methylphenidate patch]); and preference ( Krull 2019d ). Various stimulants are indicat ed for treatment o f narcolepsy and are generally considered to be second-line agents after modafinil/armodafinil due to t heir sympathomimetic AEs ( Scammell 2019 ). Lisdexamfetamine is the only FDA -approved drug indicated for th e treatment of moderate to severe BED, with demonstrated efficacy in reduc tion of mean binge days per week vs placebo. Direct compa rison trials between lisdexamfetamine and other drugs used off-label to treat BED ar e lacking. REFERENCES Adderall Kaye W, K asper S; WFSBP Task Force On Eating Disorders.

Therapeutic Class Overview Respiratory Anticholinergics INTRODUCTION The respiratory anticholinergics class includes short- and long agents, Y upelri (revefena cin) solution for nebulizer, which are all administered daily; Lonhala Magnair (gly copyrrolate) solution for nebul ization is administered tw ice daily. Other relatively long-acting agents are Tudorza Pre ation powder, which are administered twice daily. The predominant use of respiratory anticholinergics is for the treat ment of chronic obstructive pu lmonary disease (COPD); Spiriva Respimat is also indicated for selected patients with asthma. COPD is characterize d by persistent respi ratory symptoms and ai rflow limitation due to a irway and/or alveolar abnormalities. The abnormalities are usually caused by exposure to noxious particles or gase s. Airflow limitation is caused by a combination of small airway disease (eg, obstructiv e bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema); the relative cont ributions of each component vary between patients. The most common symptoms of COPD include dyspnea, cough, and sputum production ( Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] 2019 ). COPD affects 6.4% of the United States population and is the ma jor contributor to mortality from chronic lower respiratory diseases, the third leading cause of death in the U nited States ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2018). Globally, COPD is the fourth leading cause of death and is e xpected to be the third leading cause of death by 2020; the bur den of COPD continue s to increase due to continued exposure to risk factors and aging of the population ( GOLD 2019 ). Cigarette smoking is the main r isk factor for COPD; other risk factors include biomass f uel exposure (such as from cooking and heating in poorly v entilated dwellings) and air pol lution. Host factors such as genetic abnormalities, abnormal lung developmen t, and accelerated aging can predispose individuals to COPD development (GOLD 2019 ). Patients with COPD may experience exacerbations, which are peri ods of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms (GOLD 2019 ). Pharmacologic therapy for COPD can reduce symptoms, reduce the risk and severity of exacerbations, and improve patients' health status and exercise tolerance. There is no con clusive evidence that COP D medications modify the long-term decline in lung function characteristic of COPD ( GOLD 2019 ). Pharmacologic options for COPD treatment comprise several class es, including beta-agoni sts, anticholinergics, methylxanthines, various combinat ion products roflumilast. Pharmacol ogic treatments should be individualized based on symptom severity, risk of exacerbations, side effects, comorbidities, drug availability, and cost, as well as the patient's response, preference, a nd ability to use various drug delivery devices ( GOLD 2019 ). In 2015, tiotropium inhalation sp ray became the first LAMA to b e Food and Drug Administr ation (FDA)-approved for the treatment of asthma (See Tabl e 2). Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames a nd narrows the airways, making it difficult to breathe. A sthma causes recurring periods of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. Asthma affects pe ople of all ages, but most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma, including abou t 7 million children (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI] 2014). The most effective, commonly recommended long-term control medications for the treatme nt of asthma are ICSs. Alternative long-term control m onotherapy medications, such as leukotriene modifiers, m ast-cell stabilizers, and methylxanthines, are ompared to ICSs. Long-acting beta 2-agonists (LABAs) should not be used as monotherapy for asthma due to increased r isk for serious adverse events including death; however, they are considered the most effective adjunctive ther apy in patients not adequatel y controlled with an ICS 193 Data as of November 15, 2018 KS-U/JZ-U/ALS Page 2 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Tiotropium is an option fo r add-on therapy in certain pa tients requiring an additional controller medication. An interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagonis t or the immunoglobulin E (IgE) a ntagonist, omalizumab, may be added if patients require a higher level of care. Omalizum ab is used in patients with moderate to severe allergic asthma while IL-5 antagonists are used for severe eosinoph ilic asthma. Short-acting beta 2-agonists (SABAs) are the medica tion of choice for the relief of bronchospasm during acute asthma exacerbations ( Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] 2018, NHLBI, 2007 ). This review includes single-agen t LAMAs. While some respiratory anticholinergics are available in combination with other bronchodilators such as SABAs and LABAs, combination agen ts included this review.

Efficacy of the LAMAs for the management of COPD is well establ ished through placebo-controlled trials and a number of systematic reviews and me ta-analyses. The primary endpoint in most trials has focused on lung function, including measures of the forced expirato ry volume in 1 second (FEV 1). Several studies have also evaluated the impact of LAMAs on measures of quality of life and health status, and fre quency of COPD exacerbations. All of the LAMAs have de monstrated improved FEV 1 compared to placebo ( Karner et al 2014, Kerwin et al 2016, Kerwin et al 2017, LaForce et al 2016, Ni et al 2014, Ni et al 2017, Pleasants et al 2016, Aziz et al 2018 ). All of the LAMAs have demonstrat ed improvement in health status and/or COPD symptoms (Karner et al 2014, Kerwin et al 2016, Kerwin et al 2017, LaForce et al 2016, Ni et al 2014, Ni et al 2017, Pl easants et al 2016, Aziz et al, 2018, Han et al 2018, Sliwka et al 2018 ). Tiotropium and umeclidinium hav e demonstrated a significant red uction in moderate COPD exacerbations ( Karner et al 2014, Ni et al 2017, Pleasants et al 2016, Sliwka et al 2018 ). Placebo-controlled trials Tiotropium administered via the Handihaler device has been comp ared to placebo in several randomized controlled trials. A randomized double-blind trial (N = 623) demonstrated that tio tropium 18 mcg daily significantly improved trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) over placebo. Improvements were also demonstrated in peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate, transitional dyspnea index (TDI) focal scores, and St. George's Respirator y Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores compared to placebo (Donohue et al 2002 ). Another randomized double-blind trial (N = 1207) demonstrated t hat tiotropium 18 mcg daily compared to placebo led to a delayed time to first COPD ex acerbation, fewer hospital ad missions, fewer days in which patients could not perform their usual daily activit ies, improved TDI focal scores , and improved results on the SGRQ ( Brusasco et al 2003 ). A randomized double-blind trial (N = 457) in maintenance treatm ent-na\u00efve patients with COPD GOLD stage II demonstrated that tiotropium 18 mcg daily compared to placebo s ignificantly improved FEV 1 and physician's global assessments of overall health status ( Troosters et al 2014 ). In a small randomized double-bli nd trial (N = 105), patients re ceiving tiotropium 18 mcg daily showed a longer exercise endurance time compared to patients receiving placebo ( Casaburi et al 2005 ). A large, randomized, double-blin d, 4-year trial (N = 5993) (UPL IFT) demonstrated that tiotropium 18 mcg daily was associated with a significant delay in the time to first exacer bation and time to first hospita lization for an exacerbation. Although the improvement in FEV 1 with tiotropium was maintained throughout the trial, tiotropium did not lead to a significant difference in the rate of decline in FEV 1 over time. Improvements in SGR Q were demonstrated, but were less than what is generally accepted as clinically significant. Mortality was 14.9% in the tiotropium group and 16.5% in the placebo group ( Tashkin et al 2008 ). A predefined subgroup analysis of UPLIFT demonstrated that f or patients with moderate COPD (GOLD Stage II), the rate of decline for pos t-bronchodilator FEV 1 was lower in the tiotropium group compared to the placebo gr oup. However, the rate of decli ne of pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 did not differ between groups ( Decramer et al 2009 ). A multicenter, randomized, double- blind trial in patients (N = 841) with mild or moderate COPD (ie, GOLD stage 1 or 2) demonstrated that ti otropium 18 mcg daily significantly impr oved change in FEV 1 before bronchodilator use from baseline to 24 months compared to placebo (between-group differ ence, 157 2017 ). Annual decline in FEV 1 after bronchodilator use wa s lower with tiotropium vs placebo (difference, 22 mL per year; 95% CI, 6 to 37; p = 0.006 ) but the annual decline in FEV 1 before bronchodilator use was not significantly d ifferent between groups. Tiotropium administered via t he Respimat inhaler has also been compared to placebo in several randomized controlled trials. Two one-year studies (total N = 1990) evaluated tiotropium 5 mc g or 10 mcg compared to placebo. Combined results for the 5 mcg dose demonstrated the following: improved response on FEV 1 (difference, 127 mL; p 0.0001) improved SGRQ (diffe 0.0001) focal sc ore (difference, 1.05 units; p < 0.0001) reduced exacerbatio ns (odds ratio [OR], 0.75; p < 0.01) ( Bateman et al 2010a ) A one-year study (N = 3991) compared tiotropium 5 mcg to placeb o and demonstrated the following: improved response on FEV 1 (difference, 102 mL; p < 0.0001) a delayed time to first exacerbatio n (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; p < 0.0001) (Bateman et al 2010b ) 195 Data as of November 15, 2018 KS-U/JZ-U/ALS Page 4 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A systematic review summarized the data on exacerbation risk re duction with tiotropium compared to placebo (as well as compared to other COPD maintenance treatment s). A total of 2 9 articles were inclu ded, of which 20 compared tiotropium to placebo (16 with t he Handihaler and 4 with the Re spimat device). Although a formal meta-analysis was not conducted as part of this r eview, overall, the data demonstrated that tiotropium was ass ociated with a longer time to first exacerbation and fewer exac erbations, including severe ex acerbations, compared to placebo. Exacerbations were generally comparable with the Hand ihaler and Respimat formulati ons ( Halpin et al 2016 ). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 trials and 23,309 p articipants evaluated t he efficacy of tiotropium (delivered via the Respimat or Handihaler device) vs placebo. The analysis showed that tiotr opium led to statistically and clinically significant impro vements in quality of life vs p lacebo, as measured by SGRQ. Compared to placebo, tiotropium significantly reduc ed the number of exacerbations an d led to fewer hospitalizatio ns due to exacerbations, but no significant difference was f ound for all-cause hospitalizati on or mortality. Pooled analys is showed an improvement in trough FEV 1 with tiotropium vs placebo (mean difference, 119 mL; 95% CI, 1 13 to 125) ( Karner et al 2014 ). Aclidinium has also been evaluated in a number of placebo-contr olled trials. In a large, randomized double-bli nd study (N = 828), patients w ere randomized to receive a clidinium 200 or 400 mcg twice daily or placebo over 24 weeks. The mean change from baseline in trough FEV 1, the primary endpoint, was significantly larger in patient s treated with aclidinium 200 or 400 mcg compared to patient s treated with placebo. In addition, a significantly higher p roportion of patients treated with aclidinium 200 or 400 mcg experienced a clinically significant improvement in SGRQ score and TDI score when compar ed to patients treated with placebo ( Jones et al 2012 ). In the 12-week double-blind randomized to receive aclidinium 200 or 400 mcg twice daily experienced a sta tistically significant increas e from baseline in trough FEV 1 compared to patients in the placebo group. Statistically s ignificant improvements on SG RQ were demonstrated for both dose groups, but on average were less than those considered clinically meaningful. A higher proportion of patients receiving aclidinium achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in TDI scores comp ared to those in the placebo group ( Kerwin et al 2012 ). In the 12-week double-blind ACCO RD COPD II study (N = 544), pat ients randomized to receive aclidinium 200 or 400 mcg twice daily experienced a sta tistically significant increas e from baseline in trough FEV 1 compared to patients in the placebo group. SGRQ scores imp roved in all groups, but diff erences between aclidinium and placebo were not significant. A higher proportion of patient s receiving aclidini um achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in TDI scores compared to those in the placebo group ( Rennard et al 2013 ). A systematic review and meta-ana lysis of 12 multicenter randomi zed trials (total N = 9547) evaluated aclidinium vs placebo in patients with stabl e COPD. The analysis found that a clidinium resulted in a significant improvement in pre- dose FEV 1 compared to placebo (MD, 90 mL; 95% CI, 80 to 100 mL), a reduc tion in the number of patients with exacerbations ization (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 to and score (MD, -2.34; 95% CI, -3.18 to -1.51]). However, no difference wa s demonstrated i n all-cause mortality or in the number of patients with exacerbations requiring oral s teroids and/or antibiotics ( Ni et al 2014 ). A similar meta-analysis i ncluded 7 trials (total N = 7001) evaluating aclidinium vs placebo for a duration of 12 weeks. This analysis found that compared to placebo, aclidinium did not significantly reduce the incidence of exacer bations (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.07; P = 0.22) or all- cause mortality (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.94; P = 0.82). How ever, a significant difference was demonstrated for the rate of hospitalization due to exa cerbation (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.89; -1.51) forced vital capacity ( FVC), and TDI, supported the efficacy of aclidinium on l ung function and dyspnea symptom s (Zou et al 2016 ). Umeclidinium has been evaluated fo r the treatment of COPD in se veral Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo- controlled trials. One trial (N = 206) compared 2 do ses of umeclidinium, 62.5 mcg and 125 mcg daily, to plac ebo over a period of 12 weeks. Patients receiving an ICS at baseline continued treatment at a stable dose. No other long-acting bronchodilators were permitted. Improvement s in the primary end point, the least squares me an (LSM) change from baseline in FEV 1, were observed for umeclidinium 62.5 mcg daily vs placebo (127 mL; 95% CI, 52 to 202; p < 0.001) and for umeclidinium 125 mcg daily vs placebo (152 mL; 95% CI, 76 to 229; p < 0.001). Im provements were also noted for dyspnea, rescue medication use (62.5 mc g strength onl y), and SGRQ ( Trivedi et al 2014 ). A second trial 1,536) compa red mcg/25 mcg daily, and plac ebo over a period of 24 weeks. Concomitant use of ICSs at a stable dose was permitted. Improvements in the pr imary endpoint, the LSM change from baseline in FEV 1, were observed for all active 196 Data as of November 15, 2018 KS-U/JZ-U/ALS Page 5 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

For umeclidinium 62. 5 mcg daily, the improvement vs placebo was 115 mL (95% CI, 76 to 155). Improvements were also noted fo r dyspnea and time to first COPD exacerbation ( Donohue et al 2013). Two additional randomized, double-blind trials (published toget her, N = 862 and N = 872) evaluated the addition of umeclidinium to fluticasone propi onate/salmeterol in patients umeclidinium 62.5 fluticasone mcg for 12 weeks. In both impr ovement in the primary endpoint, the trough FEV 1 on day 85, was signi ficantly better in both umeclidinium groups vs pla cebo, with differences of 147 mL (95% CI, 107 to 187) and 1 27 mL (95% CI, 89 to 164) for the 62.5 mcg strength and 138 (95% CI, 97 to 178) and 148 (95% CI, 111 to 185) fo r the 125 mcg strength. Significant improvements were also demonstrated for the weighte d mean FEV 1 over 0 to 6 hours post-dose and rescue albuterol use, while results on SGRQ and the COPD Assess ment Test were mixed ( Siler et al 2016 ). A review and meta-analysis eval uated the use of umeclidinium compared to placebo (as we ll as compared to active controls). The meta-analysis i ncluded randomized trials with a duration of 12 weeks. A total of 10 trials were included. Key results from this met a-analysis were as follows ( Pleasants et al 2016 ): The weighted mean difference in FEV 1 change from baseline (primary endpoint) for umeclidinium 62.5 mcg vs placebo was 120 mL (95% CI, 100 to 130) (based on data from 7 s tudies). The weighted mean difference in T DI change from baseline for umeclidinium 62.5 mcg vs p lacebo was 0.61 (95% CI, -0.17 to 1.39) (based on data from 2 studies). The weighted mean difference in S GRQ change from baseline for u meclidinium 62.5 mcg vs placebo was -2.34 (95% CI, -4.59 to 0.08) (ba sed on data from 5 studies). Umeclidinium 62.5 mcg significant ly improved the time to first COPD exacerbation, with an HR of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.90) (based on data from 1 study). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 4 randomized controlle d trials with a durati on 12 weeks evaluated umeclidinium compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe COPD (n = 37,98). Key results from this meta- analysis were as follows (Ni et al 2017 ): Odds of moderate exacerbations requiring steroids and/or antibi otics were reduced with u meclidinium vs placebo (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.80) , but there was no difference i n odds of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization between groups (based on data from 4 studies). Umeclidinium reduced SGRQ total score compared to placebo (MD, -4.79 units; 95% CI, -8.84 to -0.75) and the odds of having an improvement 4 uni ts in SGRQ total score was high er with umeclidinium vs placebo (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.82) (based on data from 3 studies). TDI focal score was improved with umeclidinium vs placebo (MD, 0.76 units; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.09 units) (based on data from 3 studies). Change from baseline in trough FEV 1 was higher with umeclidinium vs placebo (MD, 0.14 L; 95% CI, 0 .12 to 0.17 L) (based on data from 4 studies). Glycopyrrolate has been evaluated for the treatment of COPD in Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Two 12-week trials (N = 441 and 428) evaluated the efficacy of glycopyrrolate inhalation po wder 15.6 mcg twice daily vs placebo. Both trials met their primary endpoint, demonstrati ng differences from placebo in the mean change from baseline in FEV 1 area under the curve (AUC ) from 0 to 12 hours (FEV 1 AUC 0-12) of 139 mL (95% CI, 95 to 184; p < 0.001) and 123 mL (95% CI, 81 to 165; p < 0.001), respectively. Improvement in several secondary endpoints was also demonstrated, including trough FEV 1, and SGRQ score. The difference in the TDI score was significa nt in one of the 2 studies ( Clinicaltrials.gov 2015, Kerwin et al 2016, LaForce et al 2016 ). The efficacy of nebulized glycopyrrolate was evaluated in 2 rep licate 12-week randomized controlled trials (GOLDEN 3 and 4; N = 653 and N = 641, respe ctively) in patients with mo derate to very severe COPD. Compared with placebo, patients in the intention to tr eat analysis who were randomized to nebulized glycopyrrolate 25 mcg or 50 mcg twice daily experienced significant i ncreases in the primary endpoint , FEV 1 ctively, respectively, GOLDEN 4; all p < 0.0001). Improvements from baseli ne were also observed with bot h doses of nebulized glycop yrrolate vs placebo in FVC and SGRQ et al 2017 ). Comparisons between different anticholinergics and formulations A small number of clinical trials have compared tiotropium to i pratropium. 197 Data as of November 15, 2018 KS-U/JZ-U/ALS Page 6 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A randomized, double-blind, double- dummy study (N = 288) compared tiotropium 18 mcg daily to ipratropium 40 mcg 4 times daily over 15 weeks. This study demonstrated that the F EV1 response was significantly greater for tiotropium compared to ipratropium at all ti me points (p < 0.05). Differences in trough FEV 1 values were most pronounced, whereas differences in peak FEV 1 did not reach statistical signi ficance. Improvements were also greater for tiotropium for morning and evening PEF rat e and use of rescue albuterol (van Noord et al 2000 ). A second double-blind, double-du mmy study (N = 535) also compar ed tiotropium 18 mcg daily to ipratropium 40 mcg 4 times daily. At the end of 1 year, trough FEV 1 was significantly better in the tiotropium group (difference, 150 mL; p < 0.001). FVC results paralleled those for FEV 1. Tiotropium also led to improve d PEF rates and reduced use of rescue albuterol ( Vincken et al 2002 ). Two identical trials (total N = 719) compared tiotropium Respimat in both 5 mcg and 10 mcg daily doses to placebo and to ipratropium bromide. R esults for the 5 mcg dose demonstrated that trough FEV 1 was improved significantly more with tiotropium vs placebo (difference, 118 mL; p < 0.0001) and compared to ipratropium (differenc e, 64 mL; p < 0.01) ( Voshaar et al 2008). A meta-analysis demonstrated t hat compared to patients receivin g ipratropium, patients receiving tiotropium were more likely to experience improvemen t in SGRQ scores and TDI scores. Patients receiving tiot ropium also experienced a reduced rate of exacerbations com pared to patients receiving ip ratropium ( Yohannes et al 2011 ). A systematic meta-analysis (N = 2 studies; 1073 pati ents) evaluated the and efficacy of compared to ipratropium ( Cheyne et al 2015 ). In one study, patients used ti otropium by Handihaler for 12 months, and in the other, patients used tiotr opium by Respimat for 12 weeks . Primary endpoints included the trough FEV 1 at 3 months and serious adverse events. Trough FEV 1 at 3 months was significantly i ncreased with tiotropium compar ed to ipratropium 81 to 137; I2 = 62%). Fewer patients experienced 1 non -fatal serious adverse events with tiotropium compared to ipratropium (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.73). Patients ta king tiotropium were also les s likely to experience a CO PD-related serious adverse event (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.85). Benefits were also demonstrated for tiotropium compared to ipra tropium for secondary endpoints including exacerbations, hospital admission s, and quality of life. There was no significant differenc e in mortality between the 2 treatments. The large, randomized, double-blind TIOSPIR trial (N = 17,135) compared tiotropium Respima t at a dose of 2.5 mcg or 5 mcg daily to tiotropium Handihaler (18 mcg daily). During a m ean follow-up of 2.3 years, ti otropium via Respimat and Handihaler were shown to have similar safety and efficacy profiles ( Wise et al 2013 ). Risk of death for tiotropium Res pimat 5 mcg daily vs Handihaler : HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.09. Risk of first exacerbation tiotropium Respimat 5 mcg daily vs Handihaler: HR, 0.98 ; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.03. A systematic review evaluated ti otropium Respimat 5 mcg daily v s tiotropium Handihal er 18 mcg daily on pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safe ty data. Data were included from a total of 22 compar ative studies (10 published studies, 1 submitted manuscript, and 11 Congress abstracts). Ke y results from this rev iew were as follows ( Dahl et al 2016 ): Several clinical trials demonstra ted similar pharmacokinetic pr ofiles between the 2 form ulations. Although it had previously been suggested that s ystemic exposure may be greater with tiotropium Respimat, a recent study showed that exposure may actually be slightly lower with the Respimat formulation. Results of several randomized tr ials demonstrated that the effi cacy and safety profiles ar e comparable between the 2 formulations, and results from post-hoc and pooled analyses provide further support for simi larity on lung function, exacerbations, and safety outcome s in various patient subtypes. Similar results for health-relat ed quality of life were demonst rated with each formulation based on the SGRQ total score. A double-blind, double-dummy, randomized Phase 3b trial (N = 414) compared tiotropium 18 mcg daily to aclidinium 400 mcg twice daily. This trial demonstrated no significant dif ferences between active tr eatments at week 6 in the change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC over 24 hours (AUC 0-24). FEV aclidinium, and AUC 12-24 was numerically greater with aclidinium vs tiotropium; however, differences between active treatments were not statistically significant. The 2 groups als o had comparable results for most COPD symptom measures ( Beier et al 2013 ). solution 50 mcg twice daily to tiotropium 18 mcg daily in 1086 patients with moderate to very severe COPD. The trial demon strated that the rates of 198 Data as of November 15, 2018 KS-U/JZ-U/ALS Page 7 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

There were no significant differences b etween groups in the change from baseline in FEV 1 or SGRQ. There was a similar and numerically lower incidence o f exacerbations with glycopyrrolate nebulizer solution vs tiotropium ( Ferguson et al 2017 ). Results were reported in abstract form of an open-label randomi zed control trial comparing tiotropium 18 mcg daily with aclidinium 400 mcg twice daily i n addition to background therap y in adults with moderate to severe COPD. After 8 weeks of treatment, the primary endpoint, FEV 1 AUC 0-3 was not significantly different between groups. Secondary outcomes evaluating other measur es of lung function were not si gnificantly different; however, SGRQ and Modified Medical Research Council scores w ere significantly improved wit h aclidinium ( Nakamura et al 2017 ). A network meta-analysis (N = 21 studies; strated no diffe 18 mcg daily aclidinium FEV 1, SGRQ, or score trial (N = 1107) compared umeclidinium 62.5 mcg daily delivered via the Ellipta device and tiotropium 18 mcg daily delivered via th e Handihaler device ( Feldman et al 2016 ). The primary endpoint, LSM change from baseline in trough FEV 1 at day 85 in the per-protocol popul ation (N = 976), was greate r with umeclidinium vs tiotropium (difference, 59 mL; 95% CI, 29 to 88; p < 0.001). Similar results were seen in the intention-to-treat population (difference , 53 mL; 95% CI, 25 to 81; p < 0.001). Improvem ents in the weighted mean FEV 1 over 0 to 24 hours post-dose w ere similar between treatments, but greater with umeclidinium vs tiotropium over 12 to 24 hours post-dose (difference, 70 mL; 95% CI, 14 to 127; p = 0.015). No differences were observed between umeclidinium and tiotropium in patient-reported outcomes (TDI a nd SGRQ), and the safety pro files were similar with both treatments. More patients pr eferred the Ellipta device com pared to the Handihaler, i ncluding an overall device preference and scores for ease of use. There were several limitations to this trial, including a short duration and incomplete blinding (markings differed among active tiotropium capsules and placebo, and stickers were used to obscure inhaler markings). A network meta-analysis (N = 24 studies; 21,311 participants) compared tiotropium 18 mcg daily to aclidinium 400 mcg twice daily, 50 daily (not the FDA-approved dosing), and umeclidinium 62.5 mcg daily in patients with COPD. All active treatments demonstrated favorable outcomes vs placebo for 12-week trough FEV 1, al 2015 ). Based on 17 studies (11,935 participants) for the primary endpoint, the mean change from baseline in trough FEV 1 vs placebo at 12 weeks ranged from 101.4 to 136.7 mL, and was grea test for umeclidinium, followed by glycopyrronium, tiotropium, and aclidinium. How ever, the 95% credible interval (CrI) crossed zero in all between-treatment comparisons, so superiority was not demonstrated for any single LAMA over another. A network meta-analysis (N = 27 studies; 48,140 participants) exacerbations ( al 2015 LAMAs reduc ed moderate-to-severe exacerba tions compared e were no significant differe nces demonstrated among the active treatments. The analysis also evaluated the rate of severe exacerbations. T iotropium dry powder inhaler was the only LAMA demonstrated to reduce severe ex acerbations vs placebo (HR, 0.7 3; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.86). However, the 95% CrI crossed zero in all between-treatment comparisons. The authors concluded that there were no statistically significant differences among LABAs in prev enting COPD exacerbations. Revefenacin was compared of 355 COPD pati ents; ICSs and SABAs were also allowed for the duration o f the trial period. Revefenacin at a dose of 88 mcg, 175 mc g and 350 mcg daily yielded significant improvements in trough FEV 1 at day 28 vs placebo (187.4, 166.6 and 170.6 mL, respectively; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Doses 88 mcg also led to the following impr ovements over placebo: > 80% of patients achieved a 100 mL increase from baseline FEV 1 at 4 hours post dose; sustained bronchodilation for 24 hours p ost dose; and reduction in daily albuterol puffs by > 1 puff per day. Lastly, the 350 mcg dose did not demon strate additional efficacy compared to the 175 mcg dose ( Pudi et al 2018). Comparisons between ant icholinergics and beta 2-agonists or ICS/L ABA combinations In a meta-analysis of 4 trials, t here was no statistically sign ificant differences in short-term FEV 1 changes (up to 90 minutes post dose) between indivi duals receiving ipratropium co to the LABAs salmete rol and indaca terol in several large comparative trials. 199 Data as of November 15, 2018 KS-U/JZ-U/ALS Page 8 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Two placebo-controlled trials o f tiotropium 18 mcg daily also included an active control arm in which patients received salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily . In the first trial (N = 623), the improvement in trough FEV 1 at 24 weeks was greater with tiotropium compared to salme terol (difference, 52 mL; p < 0.01). Differences also fa vored tiotropium for FVC (difference, 112 mL; p < 0.01) and PEF rate (difference, 5.9 L/ minute; p < 0.01). Tiotropi um was also better than salmeterol in improving TDI foca l score (difference, 0.78 units ; p < 0.05). The difference between active treatments in SGRQ was not statistically significant ( Donohue et al 2002 ). In the second trial (N = 1 207), improvements in FEV 1, FEV 1 area under the curve over 3 hours (AUC 0-3), and FVC were greater for tiot ropium vs salmeterol; however, there were no significant differences a mong active treatment groups for time to first COPD exacerbation, hospital admissions, or TDI focal scores ( Brusasco et al 2003 ). A large double-blind randomized (N = 7348) (POET-COPD) demonstrated that tiotropium 18 mcg daily increased the time to first COPD exacerbat ion, the risk of moderate exacerbations, and the risk of severe exacerbations compared to treatment with salmeterol (Vogelmeier et al 2011 ). Prolongation of time to the first exacerbation was also demonstrated in prespecified su bgroups of patient s with GOLD st age II COPD and patients who were maintenance- therapy-na\u00efve ( Vogelmeier et al 2013 ). A randomized trial (N = 1683) com pared 2 doses of the once-daily LABA indacaterol (150 mcg and 300 mcg) to tiotropium 18 mcg daily and to p lacebo. In this trial, patients receiving placebo or indacat erol were blinded, but tiotropium was open-label because blinded tiotropium was not av ailable. The primary endpoint, trough FEV 1 at 12 weeks, was greater for indacate rol (both doses) than for tiotro pium (difference, 40 mL; p 0.01). Greater improvements were also demonstrated for indacaterol vs tiotropium for the proportions o f patients achieving a clinically important improvemen t in TDI total score (p 0.01), use of rescue albuterol (p 0.001), and change from baseline in morning and evening PEF (p < 0.05). Rates of exacer bations did not differ amon g active treatment groups (Donohue et al 2010 ). A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial tiotrop ium 18 mcg daily to indacaterol 150 mcg daily. In this trial, trough FEV 1 with tiotropium was determine d to be non-inferior to indacater ol, but not superior (treatment difference, 0 mL; 95% CI, -20 to 20). However, FEV 1 and FVC were demonstrated to be greater with indacaterol on day 1 when evaluated 5 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour after do sing. More patients receiv ing indacaterol compared to those taking tiotropium exper ienced a clinica lly significant improvement in TDI scores (OR, 1.49; p < 0.001) and SGRQ scores (OR, 1.43; p < 0. 001). In addition, use of rescue m edication was lower in the indacaterol group ( Buhl et al 2011 ). Tiotropium has been comp ared to combination ICS/LABAs. Tiotropium 18 mcg daily has bee n compared (N = 1323). The primary endpoint in this trial, the rate of e xacerbations over 2 years, was comparable in the tiotropi um (1.32/year) and fluticasone/sa lmeterol (1.28/year) group s 0.656). Patients randomized to tiotropium were sign ificantly more likely to withdraw from the study than those randomized to fluticasone/salmeterol (HR, 1.29 ; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.54; p = 0.0 05). In addition, mortality was significantly lower in the fluticasone/salmeterol group (3% ) than in the tiotropium group (6%) (HR, 0.48; CI, 0. 27 to p 0.012) (Wedzicha et al 2008 ). Tiotropium 18 mcg daily also been compared to fluticasone f uroate/vilanterol mcg daily i n a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 12-week trial (N = 623) in patients with COPD and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or CVD risk ( 1 risk factor of hyper tension, hypercholesterolemia , or treated diabetes). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in weighted mean FEV 1 over 24 hours at 12 weeks, was s imilar in the 2 treatment arms (LSM change, 95 mL and 117 mL in the tiotropium and fluticasone furoate/vila nterol groups, respectively, w ith a difference of 22 mL [95% CI, -12 to 55; p = 0.201]). Trough FEV 1 after 12 weeks was improved to a similar extent in both groups . Some secondary endpoints seemed to favor tiotropium (change from bas eline in FVC and inspirato ry capacity), while other endpoints seemed to favor fluticas one furoate/vilanterol (onset of bronchodilation, rescue medication use, dyspnea, SGRQ, and COPD Assessment Test s cores). Safety was generally si milar, although pneumonia was reported more frequently in the fluticasone fu roate/vilanterol group. Cardiovascular monitoring did not demonstrate an increased cardiovascular risk. The cardiova scular safety profile was similar between groups; however, there were 2 deaths from cardiovascular events in the ti otropium group (both patients ha d hypertension and 1 smoked and had a family history of CVD). Fewer patients experie nced a COPD et al 2016) . In a Cochrane review which included the Covelli et al 2016 trial and one additional 12 week trial comparing tiotropium to fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (N = 880 across both trials), there were no differences between treatments when 200 Data as of November 15, 2018 KS-U/JZ-U/ALS Page 9 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Meta-analyses comparing tiotr opium to LABAs do not consistently demonstrate superiority on key endpoints for either treatment. One meta-analysis (N = 7 trials; 12,223 participants ) demonstrated a reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing 1 exacerbations w ith tiotropium compared to a LABA; however, 1 trial contributed the most weight to this analysis (Chong et al 2012 ). A systematic review and networ k meta-analysis (N = 71 trials; 7 3,062 participants) evaluat ed the efficacy of various treatment options for patients wi th COPD that could not be controlled by short-acting therapies alone. This analysis ranked ICS/LABA combinations fi rst for results on SGRQ and trou gh FEV 1. LAMAs and LABAs were ranked second and third for each measure, and t hese 2 categories of medications had similar effects overall ( Kew et al 2014 ). A systematic review and networ k meta-analysis (N = 74 trials; 74,832 participants) evaluated the efficacy SAMAs, LABAs, LAMA/LABAs L ABA/ICSs for mainte nance treatment of CO PD. At 12 and 24 weeks , LAMA, LAMA/LABAs, and LABA/ICSs led to a significant ly greater improvement in tro ugh FEV 1 compared with placebo and SAMA monotherapy. With the exception of aclidinium/formoterol, all other LAMA/LABA therapies were superior to LAMA monotherapy and LABA /ICS therapy in impr oving trough FEV 1. Furthermore, LAMA/LABA therapy had the highest probability of being the best treatment for in FEV 1 improvement; similar trends were observed for the transition dy spnea index and SGRQ sco res. Authors concluded t hat there were no significant differences among the LAMAs and LAMA/LABAs within their respective classes ( Aziz et al 2018 ). A systematic review and networ k meta-analysis (N = 10 trials; 1 0,894 participants) com pared the effects of LABA/tiotropium combination therapy vs either therapy alone ( Farne et al 2015 ). Compared to tiotropium alone, com bination treatment resulted in a slightly larger improvement in SGRQ (MD, -1.34; 95% CI, -1.87 to -0.8; 6709 participants; 5 studies). There wer e no significant differences i n hospital admissions (4 studies; 4,856 participants) or all-cause mortality (10 studies; 9633 participants). The improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 at the end of the study showed a statistically significant increase in the combination group compared to the tiotropium group (MD, 60 mL; 95% CI, 50 to 70; 10 studies; 9573 participants). Results for exacerbations were not pooled du e to clinical heterogeneity. Compared to LABA alone, combination treatment resulted in a sma ll but statistically signifi cant improvement in SGRQ (MD, -1.25; -0.37 ; 3378 participants; 4 studie s). There were no significant differences in all-cause hospitalizations, hospitalizati ons for exacerbations, or all-ca use mortality (3 studies; 3514 participants for all endpoints). The improvement i n pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 at the end of the study showed a statistically significant increase in the combination group compared to the LABA group (M D, 70 mL; 95% CI, 60 to 90; 4 studies; 3513 participants). was a signifi cantly lower risk of exacerba tion with monotherapy 0.69 3514 participants). A large, randomized-controlled trial (N = 7880) of patients wit h COPD and a history of exa cerbations did not find a difference in the rate of exacerbations between LAMA/LABA thera py with tiotropium/olodat erol [RR ( al 2018 ). A systematic review and meta-ana lysis (N = 8 trials) compared t iotropium 5 or 18 mcg with LAMA/LABA therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD; ICS therapy was also all owed and use ranged from 33.7% to 54.4% among patients in the included trials. T herapy with LABA/LAMA was sup erior to tiotropium monother apy for all of the following outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks: FEV1 peak and trough, SGRQ respond er rate, mean SGRQ score, and use of rescue medication. At 12 weeks , LABA/LAMA improved FEV 1 trough by 63 ml compared to tiot ropium alone (95% CI, 39.2 to 86.8; p < 0.01). Duri ng the same time period, LABA/LAMA improve d the SGRQ respo nder rate by 19% (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.28; p < 0 .01) and reduced SGRQ total score by 1.87 points (95% CI, - 2.72 to -1.02; p < 0.01) compared to tiotropium ( Han et al 2018). There is little data on the use of aclidinium compared to beta 2-agonists. A small study (N = 79) compared various doses of aclidinium to the LABA formoterol in a crossover study in which each treatment was given for 7 days. The primary endpoint, difference in FEV 1 AUC 0-12 on day 7, was not significantly d ifferent in the aclidinium 40 0 mcg twice daily and formoterol 12 mcg twice daily g roups (208 mL and 210 mL, respec tively). There also was no difference between treatment with aclidinium 400 mcg and formoterol with regard to changes in FEV 1 AUC 024; however, patients treated with aclidinium 400 mcg experienc ed a statistically significant improvement in FEV 1 AUC 12-24 compared to treatment with formoterol (56 mL; p < 0.01) (Singh et al 2012 ).

Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy with the tiotropium Respimat vs placebo in pat ients with asthma not well controlled on baseline therapy that included at least an ICS. Efficacy of tiotropium for the tr eatment of asthma has also bee n established through many systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported the efficacy of tiotropium i n the treatment of asthma (Rodrigo et al 2015a, Rodrigo et al 2015, Rodrigo et al 2017 ). These analyses demonstrate d the ability of tiotropium to improve lung function endpoints, including FEV 1 and/or PEF, while the impact on overall asthma control, asthma - related quality of life, and asthma exacerbations were mixed. Focused meta-analyses have als o demonstrated the efficacy of tiotropium for the management of asthma when added to an ICS compared to use of the ICS alone ( Anderson et al 2015, Wang et al 2018 ), and when added to an ICS/LABA compared to ICS/LABA alone ( Kew et al 2016 ). Studies generally supported the efficacy of tiotropium based on lung function, with less evidence for an impact on exa cerbations and asthma-related quality of life. A meta-analysis compared the addition of a LAMA (tiotropium) to addition of a LABA (salmeterol) in patients not adequately controlled on an ICS ( Kew et al 2015 ). No significant differences w ere demonstrated in the rate of exacerbations requiring or al corticosteroids. Placebo-controlled and trials Clinical trials have compared ti otropium Respimat to placebo in patients with asthma not w ell controlled on baseline therapy that included at least an ICS. A 12-week, Phase 3, multicenter, r andomized trial (N = 465) com pared tiotropium Respimat 2.5 mcg daily, 5 mcg daily, and placebo in adults with asthma who were symptomatic despite treatment with a low- to medium-dose ICS (200 to 400 mcg budesonide or equivalent ), which was continued during t he trial. The primary endpoint, change from baseline in peak FEV 1 within 3 hours of dosing (FEV 1 [0 to 3 hr]), was greater for bot h tiotropium doses compared t o placebo, with adjusted MDs of 159 mL and 128 mL for the 2.5 mcg and 5 mcg doses, respectively (p < 0.001 for both comparisons vs placebo). Both doses of tiotropium were also sup erior to placebo with regard to the secondary endpoints of adjusted mean trough FEV 1 and FEV 1 AUC 0 to 3 responses, and the other endpoints of morning and evening PEF. Adverse events were comparable across the treatmen t groups ( Paggiaro et al 2016 ). Two 24-week, Phase 3, multicent er, randomized tria N 2103) mcg daily, 5 mcg daily, salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily, or placebo in adults with asthma who were symptomatic despite treatment with a medium-dose ICS (400 to 800 mcg budesonide or equivalent) alone or in combination with a beta 2-agonist. During the study, pati ents continued their ICS, but pre-study L ABAs were discontinued. Co-pr imary endpoints were the peak FEV 1 (0 to 3 hr), trough FEV 1, and responder rate according to the 7-question Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7). Pooled data dem onstrated the following ( Kerstjens et al 2015 ): The differences vs placebo in peak FEV 1 were 223 mL (95% CI, 185 to 262) in the tiotropium 2.5 mcg gro up, 185 mL (95% CI, 146 to 223) in the tiot ropium 5 mcg group, and 196 mL (95% CI, 158 to 234) in the salmeterol group (all p < 0.0001 vs placebo). The differences in trough FEV 1 were 180 mL (95% CI, 138 to 221) in the tiotropium 2.5 mcg gro up, 146 mL (95% CI, 105 to 188) in the tiotropium 5 mcg group, and 114 mL (95% CI, 73 to 155) in the salmeterol group (all p < 0.0001 vs placebo). There were more ACQ- 7 responders (improvement of 0.5) in the tiotropium 2.5 mcg group (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03 to 0.031), tiotropium mcg group (OR, 1.32; CI, 1.02 p = 0.035), and salmeterol group (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.89; p = 0.0039), than in the placebo gr oup. Severe asthma exacerbations wer e recorded in 4%, 6%, 6%, and 8% patients in the tiotropium mcg, 5 mcg, salmeterol, and placebo groups, r espectively. At least 1 episod e of asthma worsening wa s recorded in 22%, 28%, 25%, and 32% of patients, respectively. The investigators noted a statistically significan t reduction in risk of first severe exacerbation with tiotr opium 2.5 mcg (p = 0.0084) and of first asthma worsening with tiotropium 2.5 mcg and salmeterol (p = 0.0007 and 0.013, respectively) vs placebo. The numbers of adverse events and serious adv erse events were c omparable among groups. Additional support for the safety and efficacy of tiotropium fo r asthma treatment was provided by the results of two 48- week, Phase 3, multicenter, randomized trials (total N = 912) c omparing tiotropium Respima t 5 mcg daily to placebo in adults with asthma not adequately controlled on an ICS ( 800 mcg budesonide or equivalent) and a LABA. Tiotropium was superior to placebo for endpoi nts including mean change in peak FEV 1, trough FEV 1, and the time to first severe 202 Data as of November 15, 2018 KS-U/JZ-U/ALS Page 11 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Howe ver, it should be noted that th is study only evaluated a dose that is higher than the FDA-approved dose for asthma ( Kerstjens et al 2012 ). Two randomized Phase 3 trials e valuated the use of tiotropium R espimat in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. A 12-week trial (N = 392) compar ed tiotropium Respimat 2.5 mcg daily, 5 mcg daily, and plac ebo in patients with severe asthma who were on backg round treatment of an ICS plus 1 controller medications, such as a LABA. The difference vs placebo for the primary endpoint, peak FEV 1 (0 to 3 hr), was 111 mL (95% CI, 2 to 220) for the 2.5 mcg dose and 90 mL (95% CI, -19 to 198) for the 5 mcg dose ( Hamelmann et al 2017 ). A = 398) compar ed tiotropium Respimat 2.5 mcg daily, 5 mcg daily, and plac ebo in patients with moderate asthma who were on background treatment of at least an ICS. The difference vs placebo in the primary endpoint, peak FEV 1 (0 to 3 hr) was 134 mL (95% C I, 34 to 234) for the 2.5 mcg dos e and 174 mL (95% CI, 76 to 272) for the 5 mcg dose ( Clinicaltrials.gov 2014, Spiriva Respimat prescribing information 2018 According to the prescribing in formation, efficacy of tiotropiu m in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age was based on extrapolation of efficacy in adul ts, and on 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 12 and 48 weeks duration. A total of 801 patients aged 6 to 11 years were enrolled in the 2 trials (271 receiving tiotropium 2.5 mcg daily 265 receiving tiotropium 5 mcg daily, and 265 receiving placebo). The primary endpoint in both trials was the change from baseline in the peak FEV 1 (0 to 3 hr), with the evaluati on defined at week 12 in the 12- week trial and at week 24 in the 48-week trial ( Spiriva Respimat prescribing information 2018 ). The 12-week trial enrolled patients with severe asthma who were on background treatment o f ICS plus 1 controller medication (eg, LABA). The mean di fference vs pla cebo in the primary endpoint was 40 mL (95% CI, -30 mL to 100 mL; not significant). The 48-week trial enrolled patients with moderate asthma on bac kground treatment of a t least an ICS. The mean difference vs placebo in the primary endpoint was 170 mL (95% C I, 110 to 230). An additional trial in children aged 6 to 11 years with severe symptomatic asthma randomiz ed patients to double-blind tiotropium 5 mcg, 2.5 mcg, or placebo administered via a Respim at device in addition to background therapy with medium-dose ICS. After 12 weeks , tiotropium 5 mcg, but not 2.5 mcg, improved the primary end point, peak FEV 1 within 3 hours after dosing com pared with placebo (MD, 139 mL; 95% CI, 75 to 203 and 35 mL; 95% CI, -28 to 99 for 5 and 2.5 mcg doses, respect ively). Results were similar fo r the key secondary endpoint, trough FEV 1 (Szefler et al 2017 ). Systematic reviews and network meta-analyses A systematic review and meta-analysis (N = 13 studies; 4966 pat ients) evaluated the effica cy and safety of tiotropium in patients with asthma. Tiotropi um was given via the Respimat device in most studies, and the duration of the included studies ranged from 4 to 52 weeks ( Rodrigo et al 2015a ). In 10 studies evaluating the addition of tiotropium to an ICS vs ICS alone in patients with mild or moderate asthma, the analysis demonstrated signifi cant improvements in morning and evening PEF (MD, 22 to 24 L/min; p < 0.00001) and peak and trough FEV 1 (MD, 150 mL; 95% CI, 110 to 180 and 140 mL; 95% CI, 110 to 160 , respectively) with the addition of tiotropium. Tiotropium also significantly improved ACQ-7 and Asthma Quality of L ife Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores from baseline (MD, -0. 14 units; 95% CI, -0.19 to -0.09 a nd 0.07 units; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.13, respectively). Tiotropium was also associated with a decrease in the number of patients with 1 asthm a exacerbation RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.95). In 4 studies comparing the addition of either tiotropium or LAB A to an ICS in patients with moderate asthma, tiotropium improved morning PEF more than LABA, but the magnitu de of the difference was sm all (6.6 L/min). There were no significant differences in evening PEF or peak or troug h FEV 1. The addition of tiotropium was inferior to the addition of LABA for AQLQ (MD, - 0.12 units; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0 .18). There were no signific ant differences in ACQ-7 total score or the number of pat ients with 1 exacerbation. In 3 studies comparing triple t herapy (tiotropium with ICS/LABA) vs LABA with a high-dose ICS in patients with severe asthma, the analysis demonstrated significant improvements with triple therapy in morning and evening PEF (MD, 16 L/min; p < 0.0004 and 20 L/min; p < 0.00001, respectively). Peak and trough FEV 1 was also significantly greater with triple therapy (MD, 120 mL; 95% CI, 90 to 160 and 80 mL; 95% CI , 40 to 110, respectively ). Triple therapy was associated with significant impro vements CI, 0.05 to 0.18, respectivel y). Patients treated with trip le therapy also had a lower lik elihood of experiencing 1 exacerbation (18.2% vs 24%; RR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.94). 203 Data as of November 15, 2018 KS-U/JZ-U/ALS Page 12 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A systematic review and meta-analysis (N = 3 studies; 895 patie nts) evaluated the use o f tiotropium Respimat in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years wi th moderate to severe asthma. Patients were a lso receiving an ICS or ICS/LABA and the duration of the studies ra nged from 4 to 48 weeks. Prim ary outcomes were peak and trough FEV 1 (Rodrigo et al 2015b ). Tiotropium was associated with significant improvements in peak and trough FEV 1 with mean changes from baseline of 120 mL and 100 mL vs placebo, r espectively (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Benefits were also shown with ti otropium for the secondary endp oint of exacerbation risk. T here were no significant differences in the rate of ACQ-7 response, rescue medication us e, withdrawals, adverse events, or serious adverse events. A systematic review and meta-ana lysis (N = 3 studies; approxima tely 900 patients) evaluat ed the use of tiotropium Respimat in children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate to severe symptomatic asthma. Patie nts were also receiving maintenance therapy with ICS or ICS plus 1 controller medicat ion and the duration of the studies ranged from 4 to 48 weeks. Primary outcomes were peak and trough FEV 1 (Rodrigo et al 2017 ). Tiotropium demonstrated significa nt improvements in peak FEV 1 of 102 mL and trough FEV 1 of 82 mL vs placebo (p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). Tiotropium significantly increased the rate of ACQ-7 responders (p = 0.04) and decreased the number of patients 1 exacerbations (p = 0.002) vs placebo. There were no significant diffe rences in rescue medication use, study withdrawals, adverse events, or withdrawals due to adverse events. A systematic review and meta-analysis (N = 5 studies; 2563 pati ents) evaluated the safety and efficacy of an ICS plus LAMA vs ICS alone in patients with asthma. The LAMA used was tiotropium Respimat in all st udies, and the duration of treatment ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. All studies used a double -blind, double-dummy design. The primary outcomes included exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, quality of life, and all-cause se rious adverse events ( Anderson et al 2015 ). Based on 4 studies in 2277 pati ents, the rate of exacerbations requiring oral corticoster oids was lower in patients taking a LAMA add-on than in thos e receiving the same dose of I CS alone (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.93; I2 3 studies in 1713 pati ents, scores on t he AQLQ were sl ightly higher for those taking a LAMA add-on compared to ICS alone (MD, 0. 05; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.12; I2 = 0%), but the difference was not statistically significant and was less than the established minimal clinically important difference of 0.5. Based on 5 studies in 2,562 participants, patients taking a LAM A reported fewer serious adverse events, but the effect was too inconsistent and imprecise to suggest a definite benefit over an ICS alone (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.23 to 1.57; I2 = 59%). Benefits were also demonstrated with add-on LAMA therapy compared to ICS alone for the secondary endpoints including FEV 1 and PEF. Differences were not sta tistically significant for AC Q results or the number of exacerbations requiring hospitalization. A systematic review and meta-analysis compared the use of a LAM A vs a LABA when added to an ICS in patients with asthma. A total of 7 trials were included in the narrative review, and 4 of these trials (N = 2049) were included in the meta-analysis. All of the studies included in the meta-analysis used tiotropium as the LA MA and salmeterol as the LABA, and the duration of the tria ls ranged from 14 to 24 weeks. The primary outcomes included exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids , quality of life, and serious adverse events ( Kew et al 2015). Based on 3 studies in 1753 patients, there was no significant d ifference in the rate of exa cerbations requiring oral corticosteroids betw een the LAMA and LABA groups (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.50 to 2.18). Based on 4 studies in 1,745 patients, those treated with a LAMA scored slightly worse than those treated with a LABA for quality of life measured on the AQLQ (MD, -0.12; 95% CI, -0 .18 to -0.05). The difference was statistically significant, but both results fe ll below the established minima l clinically important difference of 0.5. There was no difference detect ed in the rate of serious adverse events (OR, 0.84; 95% C I, 0.41 to 1.73); however, the rate of serious adverse event s was too low for this result to be considered reliable. Secondary endpoints showed little or no difference between the LAMA and LABA groups ; these included FEV 1, PEF, FVC, exacerbations requiring hosp italization, and ACQ results. A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the addition of a LAMA to adults with asth ma not well controlled by an ICS/LABA. Three double-blind tr ials (total N = 1197) compari ng LAMA to placebo were included, and all trials evaluated tiotropium (mostly 5 m cg once daily via Respimat) ( Kew et al 2016 ). 204 Data as of November 15, 2018 KS-U/JZ-U/ALS Page 13 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Based on 2 studies enrolling 907 patients, it was found that pa tients taking tiotropi um plus an ICS/LABA had numerically fewer exacerbations r equiring oral corticosteroids than those taking an ICS/LABA alone, but the confidence intervals did not rul e out lack of a difference (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.07). N o benefit on quality of life was seen with the additi on of tiotropium, based on results from the AQLQ (MD, 0.09; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.20). Secondary endpoints demonstrated a benefit on lung function, bu t no significant improvement in exacerbations requiring hospital admission or sc ores on asthma control measur ed by the ACQ. A meta-analysis of 4 randomized c ontrolled trials evaluated tio tropium when added to low- to medium-dose ICS in adults with moderate uncontroll ed asthma, and found significant improvement with tiotropium in FEV percent predicted (3.46%; 95% to 151.13). These results were cons istent among subgroups treated with different doses of tiotropium ( Wang et al 2018 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES COPD The 2019 GOLD guidelines state that the management strategy for stable COPD should be p redominantly based on an assessment of the patient's sympt oms and risk of exacerbations; the risk of exacerbations is based on a patient's exacerbation history. Key recom mendations from the GOLD guideli nes are as follows ( GOLD 2019 ): Inhaled bronchodilators are central to symptom management in CO PD and commonly given on a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms. Inhaled bronchodilators are reco mmended over oral bronchodilators. LAMAs and LABAs significantly improve lung function, dyspnea, a nd health status, and reduce exacerbation rates. LAMAs and LABAs are preferred over short-acti ng agents except for patients with onl y occasional dyspnea. LAMAs have a greater effect on ex acerbation reduction compared to LABAs and decrease hospitalizations. Patients may be started on single long-acting bronchodilator th erapy or dual long-acting bronchodilator therapy. In patients with persistent dyspn ea on 1 bronchodilator, treatment should be escalated to 2 bronchodilators. Combination treatment with a LABA and LAMA: Reduces exacerbations compared to monotherapy or ICS/LABA. Increases FEV 1 and reduces symptoms compared to monotherapy. Long-term monotherapy with ICSs is not recommended. Long-term t reatment with ICSs may be considered in association with LABAs for patient s with a history of exacerbat ions despite treatment with long-acting bronchodilators. Triple inhaled therapy of LAMA/LABA/ICS improves lung function, symptoms, and health status and reduces exacerbations compa red to ICS/LABA or L AMA monotherapy. Treatment recommendations are given for patients with COPD based on their GOLD patien t group (see Table 3). Group A: Patients should be offered bronchodilator treatment (s hort- or long-acting), based on its effect on breathlessness. This should be co ntinued if symptomatic benefit is documented. Group B: Initial therapy should consist of a long- acting bronch odilator (LAMA or LABA). For p atients with persistent on monotherapy, use of 2 bronchodilators is reco mmended (LAMA + LABA). F or patients with severe breathlessness, initial therapy with 2 bronchodilators m ay be considered. If t he addition of a second bronchodilator does not improve symptoms, it is suggested that treatment could be stepped down to a single bronchodilator; switching to anot her device or molecules can al so be considered. Group C: Initial therapy should be a LAMA. Patients with persis tent exacerbations may benefit from adding a second long-acting bronchodilator (LAMA + LABA, preferred) or using an ICS + LABA. For patients who have a history and/or findings suggestive of asthma-COPD overlap or bl ood eosinophil count 300 cells/\u00b5L, ICS + LABA is preferred. Group D: In general, it is recomm ended to start therapy with a LAMA. For patients with more severe symptoms, especially dyspnea and/or exercise limitation, LAMA/LABA may be considered for initial treatment. In some patients, initial therapy with an ICS + LABA may be the first c hoice; these patients ma y have a history and/or findings suggestive of asthma-COPD overlap or blood eosinophil count 300 cells/\u00b5L. In patients who develop further exacerbations on LAMA + LABA therapy, alternative pathw ays include escalation to a LAMA + LABA + ICS (preferred) or a switch to an ICS + LABA. If patients treated w ith a LAMA + LABA + ICS still have exacerbations, options for selected patients may include addition of roflumilast, addition of a macrolide , or stopping the ICS. Table 3.

The guidelines state that certain combination bronchodilators or bronchodilator/ICS combinations may reduce exacerbations, but do not state that any combination is superior to LAMA monotherapy in patients with stable COPD (Criner et al 2015 ). Asthma The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) gu ideline from the NHLBI s tates that the initial treatment of asthma should correspond to the appropriate asthma severity category, and it provides a stepwise approach to asthma management. Long -term control medications such as ICSs, long-acting bronchodilators, leukotriene modifiers, cromo lyn, theophylline, and immunomodulators should be taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. ICSs are the most potent and consistent ly effective long-term asthma control medication. Quick-relief medications such as SAB As and anticholinergics are used to provide prompt relief of bronchoconstriction and accompanying acute symptoms s uch as cough, c hest tightness, and wheezing. Systemic corticosteroids are i mportant in the treatment of mode rate or severe exacer bations because these medications prevent progression of the exacerbation, speed reco very, and prevent relapses ( SABA in moderate-to- severe asthma exacerbations, and may be used as an alternative bronchodilator for patients who do not tolerate a S ABA. The guideline states that ipratro pium and tiotropium have not d emonstrated effectiveness in the long-term management of asthma; however, i t should be noted that this guideline has not been updated since 2007. The GINA guideline also provides a stepwise approach to asthma management. It recommends an ICS as a preferred initial controller medication c hoice, with an increased ICS dos e and/or addition of a LABA for increasing symptom severity (higher steps). At the highest step, it is recommended that the patient be referr ed for inhaler is re commended as an add-on controller option in patients at higher steps (4 and 5). At step 4, it is recommended under \"o ther controller options\" (not preferred), and at step 5, i t is recommended as one of several preferred ad d-on treatment options. In this setting, tiotropium is recommended as an add-on treatment for patients with a history of exa cerbations; however, the guidelin e states that tiotropium is no t for use in children less than 12 years of age. Add-on tiotropium by mist inhaler improves lung function and increases the time to s evere exacerbation. A guideline on the definition, e valuation, and treatment of sev ere asthma is available from the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the Americ an Thoracic Society (ATS) ( Chung et al 2014 ). The guideline notes that ipratropium is commonly used in severe asthma patients in an a ttempt to reduce the daily use of beta 2-agonists, as well as in the treatment of asthma exacerbations. Although considered to be less effective, ipratropium is well tolerated and may be used alternately with beta 2-agonists for as-needed use throughout the day. Tiotropium has been shown to improve lung function and symptoms in moderate-to-severe asthma patients not controlled on a moderate- to high-dose ICS with or without a LA BA. In patients taking hi gh doses of an ICS and a LABA, the addition of tiotropium h as provided improvements in F EV1, reduced as-needed SABA use, and modestly reduced the risk of a severe exacerbation. However, there have been no studies of tiotropium in children with asthma.

Yupelri ( revefenacin) is contraindicated in patients with hyperse nsitivity to revefenacin or components of the product. Key warnings and precautions are similar among the anticholiner gics, and also be noted that anticholinergics are for maint enance treatment and are not for initial treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm where rescue therapy is required. The most common adverse effects reported for each anticholinerg ic are as pharyngitis, non-specific Respimat (> ( 2% incidence): cough, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and back pain Although earlier trials raised some concerns about increased mo rtality with tiotropium when administered by the Respimat inhaler, a large, randomized, double-blind trial revea led no increased mortality for patients treated with tiotropium Respimat compared to tiotropium Handihaler, Tudorza, use, and Seebri are Pregnancy Category C, while Atrov ent HFA and solution Respimat, Lonhala Magnair, and Yupelri and are not currently assigned a Pregnancy Category. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION Administration devices vary among products, and ease of use may vary based on patients' dexterity and coordination. Notably, Seebri Neohaler and Spir iva Handihaler require inserti ng individual capsules into the inhaler prior to each dose, and Spiriva Respimat require s coordination of inhalation with actuation of the device. The patient's ability to use an inhalation device is an importa nt consideration in product s election. Table 4.

(tiotropium) All LAMAs are indicated for the long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in p atients with COPD, while Spiriva Handihaler to reduce COPD exacerbations. Spiriva Respimat is additionally indicated for while th e Seebri Neohaler and Tudorza Pressair are administered twice daily. Lonhala Magnair is administered twice daily via the Magnair nebulizer. This product is appropriate for a small percentage of COPD pa tients who are unable to effectively use o ther inhalation devices. Devices and administration methods vary among products, and som e may be favored over others for patients with dexterity issues, suboptimal peak inspiratory flow rate, and/or difficulty with coordinating actuation of the device with inhalation. Current clinical evidence support s the efficacy of all products in this class for their FD A-approved indications, and efficacy is well established thr ough placebo-controlled trials and systematic rev iews and meta-analyses. Improvement in lung function, health status and/or respiratory symptoms vs placebo has been demonstrated for all products. Limited comparisons among LAMAs have been conducted. Some have demonstrated differences, particularly for the lung function endpoints (ie, FEV 1), but no clear differences in sy mptoms or other patient-report ed outcomes. Tiotropium and umeclidinium have evidence supporting a reductio n in COPD exacerbations; however, only tiotropium is indicated to reduce exacerbations per FDA-approved labeling. Safety is comparable a mong products. Key warnings/precautions and Yupelri (revefenacin) assigned a Pregnancy Category. GOLD guidelines recommend LAMAs fo r most patients with COPD, as they improve lung function, dyspnea, and health status, and reduce exacerbations. There is no preference stated for one LAMA compared to another; however, the choice of agent should be based on an assessment of the patient's s ymptoms and risk of exacerbatio ns. LAMAs have a greater effect on ex acerbation reduction compared to LABAs. Guidelines emphasize that the use of long-acting bronchodilator s is recommended over short -acting bronchodilators except for patients with only oc casional dyspn ea, and inhaled t herapy is preferred. GINA guidelines recommend tiotr opium Respimat be considered in patients aged 12 years whose asthma is not well controlled with an ICS/LABA combin ation; its FDA-approved indication extends its use to patients aged 6 years.

Therapeutic Class Overview Respiratory Beta-Agonist Combination Agents INTRODUCTION Respiratory beta 2-agonist combination agents include a beta 2-agonist combined with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), inhaled anticholinergic, or both. Beta 2-agonists can be hort-acting Similarly, inhaled an ticholinergics, also known as muscarinic can be short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA); most combinations contain a LAMA. Individual beta 2-agonist combinations are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treat ment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonar y disease (COPD), or both. All combinations of a beta2-agoni st and an ICS are indicated for the treatment of asthma, and some are additionally indicated for the treatment of COPD. Combinations of a beta 2-agonist and an anticholinergic medication are indicated for CO PD, as is the one available LAMA/LABA/ICS triple combination agent. Refer to Tables 2A, 2B, and 2C fo r specific indications for eac h product. Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes rec urring periods of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of br eath, and coughing. Asthma affects people of all ages, but m ost often starts during childhood. In the United States (U.S.), more than 25 million pe ople are known to have asth ma, including about 7 million children ( National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI] 2017 ). COPD is characterize d by persistent respi ratory symptoms and ai rflow limitation due to a irway and/or alveolar abnormalities. The abnormalities are usually caused by exposure to noxious particles or gase s, and cigarette smoking is a key risk factor. Airflow limit ation is caused by a combinatio n of small airway disease (eg, o bstructive bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphyse ma). The most common symptoms of COPD include dyspnea , cough, and sputum production ( Global Initiative for Chronic Ob structive Lung Disease [GOLD] 2019 ). COPD affects 6.4% of the U.S. population and is a major contri butor to mortality from chronic lower respiratory diseases, the thir d leading cause of death in the U.S. ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2018 ).

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Beta 2-agonist/corticosteroid combin ations for asthma and COPD Comparisons to placebo, monotherapy, combined use of individual components, varied treatments, or usual care: Numerous trials have compared the combination ICS/LABA products to their respective individual components as monotherapy, and in general, results have demonstrated that adm inistration of the combinati on product is more effective than monotherapy for improving l ung function and/or achieving c ontrol of symptoms in asthma and COPD ( Bateman et al 2001, Bateman et al 2004, Bateman et al 2006, Bateman et al 2014, Bateman et al 2018, Berger et al 2010, Bernstein et al 2015, Bleecker et al 2014, Calverley et al 2003, Corren et al 2007, Eid et al 2010, FDA AirDuo RespiClick Medical Review 2017, Gappa et al 2009, Hanania et al 2003, Jenkins et al 2006, Kerwin et al 2009, Kerwin et al 2013, Kuna et al 2006, Lalloo et al 2003, Lundback et al 2006, Martinez et al 2013, Meltzer et al 2012, Morice et al 2007, Murphy et al 2008, Nelson et al 2003a, Nathan et al 2006, Noonan et al 2006, O'Byrne et al 2014, Pearlman et al 2004, Pearlman et al 2017, Pohl et al 2006, Raphael et al 2018, Rennard et al 2009, Rodrigo et al 2016, Rodrigo et al 2017, Sharafkaneh et al 2012, Sher et al 2017, Tal et al 2002, Tashkin et al 2008, Vaessen-Verberne et al 2010, Vestbo et al 2005, Weinstein et al 2010 ). Results for reducing COPD exacerbations have been inconsiste nt (Dransfield et al 2013, Ohar et al 2014 ). Although a synergistic effect of combination inhalers has been suggested by some data, overall there are similar efficacy between the administration of the combination IC S/LABA products and their individual components used in combination (Chapman et al 1999, Jenkins et al 2006, Marceau et al 2006, Nelson et al 2003b, Noonan et al 2006, Perrin et al 2010, Rosenhall et al 2002). Improved adherence with combination inhalers has also been suggested but not been shown conclusively ( Marceau et al 2006, Perrin et al 2010 ). A large, double-blind, randomiz ed trial (N = 6112) compared flu ticasone propionate/salmeter ol 500/50 mcg twice daily to its individual components and to p lacebo over a 3-year period in patients with COPD ( Calverley et al 2007 ). The primary endpoint, time to death from any cau se, for the combination vs placebo failed to reach statisti cal significance (12.6% vs 15.2%; p = 0.052). However, the difference in mortality between the combination therapy and fluticasone monotherapy did reach statistical signific ance (12.6% vs 16%; p = 0.007). Treatment with the combination regimen resulted in significantly fewer exacerbati ons, improved health status, and improved lung function compared with placebo. A large, double-blind, randomiz ed trial (SUMMIT; N = vs fluticasone alone, vilanterol alone, or placebo in a po pulation of patients with moderate COPD and heightened cardiovascular risk (age 60 y ears and receiving medication fo r >2 of the following: hyperchol esterolemia, hypertension, diabetes Vestbo et al 2016a ). Compared with placebo, t here was no significant benefit or worsening in all-cause mortality with combination th erapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 88 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74 to 1.04; p = 0.137]) or with the components (flutica sone furoate HR, 0.91 C = 0.284]; vilanterol HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0. 81 to 1.14; p = 0.655]). Composite cardiovascular events were also similar in the 4 groups (3.9% to 4.4%). All treatments re duced the risk of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations compared to placebo, with percent reductions of 29% (95% C I, 22 to 35), 12% (95% CI, 4 to 19), and 10% (95% CI, 2 to 18) in the fluticasone (Salford Lung use of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 mcg daily to continuation of usual ca re in a real-world patient population in the United Kingdom (Vestbo et al 2016b ). Enrolled patients had COPD, h ad had 1 exacerbations in the previous 3 years, and were taking regular maintenance inhaler therapy ( 1 long-acting bronchodil ators; ICS alone or in combination with a long-acting bronchodilator; or a combination of ICS, L ABA, and LAMA). The p rimary endpoint, the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations among patients w ho had had an exacerbation within 1 year before the trial, w as 1.74 per year in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol g roup and 1.90 per year in the u sual-care group, for a differe nce of 8.4% (95% CI, 1.1 to 15.2; p = 0.02). Serious adverse events, including pneumonia, w ere similar between the 2 groups. A meta-analysis of 19 trials evaluated the use of ICS/ LABA comb inations compared to placebo in patients with COPD, and demonstrated a significant redu ction in exacerbation rate etween fluticasone al 2013a ). number of exacerbations, the istically significant; however, the mometasone 215 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/SS-U/ALS Page 4 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

This meta-analysi s also demonstrated that when re sults for all combined inhalers vs placebo were pooled, there was an overall reduction in mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0 .82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99). A meta-analysis of 14 trials evaluated the use of ICS/LABA comb inations compared to u se of the same as monotherapy in pati ents with COPD ( Nannini al 2012 ). This analysis demonstrated t hat exacerbation rates were reduced with ICS/LABA combinati on therapy compared to LABA mono therapy (rate ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.84). However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of p neumonia with combination therapy compared to LABA monotherapy (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.01). A meta-analysis of 15 trials evaluated the use of ICS/LABA comb inations compared to use of ICS monotherapy in patients with COPD ( Nannini et al 2013b ). This analysis demonstrated that exacerbation rates were sign ificantly reduced with ICS/LABA combination therapy vs ICS monotherapy (rate rati o, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0. 94). Adverse events were similar between treatments; pneum onia rates as diagnosed by che st x-ray were lower than th ose reported in earlier trials. A meta-analysis of 14 trials (to tal N = 6641) Dwan et al 2016 ). Primary endpoints included health-related quality of life (H RQoL) and severe asthma exacerbations (defined by hospital admission or treatmen t with oral corticosteroi ds). Fewer than half of the studies reported on these primary endpoints, and there were few opportunities to combine results from the included studies. One of the 14 studies ev aluated HRQoL (as measured by the Asthma Quality of Questionnaire [AQLQ]) for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 mcg uticasone (mean difference, 0.30; 95% CI, studies comp ared fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 mcg with bations; both st udies reported no exacerbations in either tr eatment arm. No comparisons relevant to the primary outcomes were found for fluticasone fur oate/vilanterol at a higher dose (200/25 mcg) vs placebo. There was insufficient evidence to assess whether once-daily fl uticasone furoate/vilanterol h ad better or worse safety or efficacy compared to twice-daily fluticasone propionate/salmete rol. The authors stated that firm conclusions could not be drawn due to the limited number of studies, variety of endpoint s, and short duration of most trials. Several large studie s focused pr imarily on safety endpoints, wi th efficacy endpoints as secondary ( Peters et al 2016, Stempel et al 2016a, Stempel et al 2016b ). The studies compared the use of ICS/LABA combinations to ICS monotherapy in patients with asthma. These studies each demonst rated non-inferiority of the ICS/LABA combination to ICS monotherapy for the risk of serious asthma-related events, offering reassurance for th e safety of these agents. A randomized, double-blind study ( AUSTRI; N = 11,679) enrolled adults and adolescents (age 12 years) with persistent asthma and a history of exacerbation within the prev ious year ( Stempel et propionate for 26 weeks. Patients were stratified by thei r baseline asthma control quest ionnaire (ACQ)-6 score and current asthma medication to determine the fluticasone propionate dose (100, 250, or 500 mcg twice daily) and were r andomized to receive this dose with or without concomitant salmeterol. The primary safety endpoint was the first serious asthma-related event, a composite endpoi nt that included death, endotracheal intubation, and hospi talization. There were 36 eve nts in 34 patients in the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol group and 38 events in 33 patients in the fluticasone propionate group (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, non-inferior to fluticasone propionate for this endpoint. There were no a sthma-related deaths. The main efficacy endpoint was the first severe asthma exacerbation, defined as asthma deterioration leading to the use of systemic glucocortico ids for 3 days or an asthma-r elated hospitalization or e mergency department visit leading to the use of systemic gl ucocorticoids. At least 1 seve re asthma exacerbation was reported in 480 patients (8%) in the fluticasone propionat e/salmeterol group and in 597 flut icasone propionate group (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.89; p < 0.001). A similarly designed trial (V ESTRI; N = 6208) enrolled pediatri c patients 4 to 11 years of age ( Stempel et al 2016b ). Enrolled patients had a history of exacerbation within the prev ious year and consistent u se of asthma medication during the 4 weeks bef ore enrollment. Patients were r andomized, on the basis of pretrial medication, Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) score, and exacerbation history, mcg or 250 mcg twice daily for 26 weeks. The primary safety endpoint, the fi rst serious asthma-related e vent (death, intubation, or ho spitalization), occurred in 27 patients in the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol group a nd 21 patients in the fl uticasone propionate group 216 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/SS-U/ALS Page 5 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The primary efficacy endpoint w as the first severe asthma exace rbation, defined as asthma deterioration leading to the use of systemic glucocorti coids for 3 days or a depot inj ection of glucocorticoids. One or more severe asthma exacerbations occurred in 8.5% o f patients in the fluticasone p ropionate/salmeterol group a nd 10.0% of onate group (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73 to An additional randomized, double-blind trial (N = 11,693) compa red the safety of formoter ol/budesonide to budesonide alone in patients 12 years of age ( Peters et al 2016 ). Enrolled patients were recei ving daily asthma medication and had had 1 exacerbation in the previous year. Patients were st ratified to a dose level o f budesonide on the basis of asthma control and prior treatm ent. Patients were then randomiz ed to receive budesonide/formoterol actuations of actuations of 80 mcg or 160 mcg) twice daily for 26 weeks. The primary safety endpoint, the fi rst serious adverse event (d eath, intubation, or hospitaliz ation), occurred in 43 of 5,846 patients receiving budesonide/formoterol and 40 of 5,847 patients receiving formoter ol alone (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.65); this demonstrated non-inferiority for budeso nide/formoterol vs budesonide alone. Two of the events (both in the bude sonide/formoterol group) were asthma-re lated deaths; the remaining events were asthma- related hospitalizations. The primary efficacy endpoint, t he first asthma exacerbation (defined as a deterioration of asthma requiring systemic glucocorticoids for 3 days, inpatient hospitalization for asthma, or an emergency department visit for asthma that resulted in receipt of systemic glucocorticoids) oc curred in 9.2% of patients in the budesonide/formoterol group and 10 .8% of patients in the budesonide group (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.94). A trial of 4215 patients 12 year s of age with mild asthma fou nd that budesonide/formoterol as needed was noninferior to budesonide twice da ily for the reduction of seve re asthma exacerbation. T he annualized rate of severe exacerbations was 0.11 (95% CI, 0 .10 to 0.13) and 0.12 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.14), respectively (rate ratio, 0.97; upper one-sided 95% conf idence limit, 1.16) How ever, budesonide/formoterol was inferior to budesonide for symptom control as the change in ACQ-5 s core showed a difference of 0.1 1 units (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.15) in favor of budesonide maintenance therapy ( Bateman et al 2018 ). Comparisons between differ ent ICS/LABA combinations There are some data av ailable comparing different combination I CS/LABA products for t he treatment of COPD. One crossover study comparing budesonide/formoterol to fluticas one propionate/salmeterol demonstrated no significant difference between products for the primary endpoin t, the increase from baseline in peak expiratory flow 5 minutes after the morning dose ( Partridge et al 2009 ). However, the mean morning fo rced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) improved more with budesonide/formoterol at 5 minutes and 15 minutes post-dose compared to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol. Several published trials compared fluticasone l to fluticasone propionate/sa lmeterol in patients with COPD. Three of the trials were published together; pooled resul ts demonstrated a greater improvement with fluticasone daily compared t o 250/50 mcg twice daily on the primary endpoint, the weighted mean (wm) FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr) (Dransfield et al 2014 ). However, 2 of these 3 trials did not demonstrate a significant difference on this e ndpoint. An additional trial compared twice daily, and found no significant difference between groups on the wm FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr) ( Agusti et al 2014 ). There have been several trials c omparing combination ICS/LABA products to one another for the treatment of asthma. Several head-to-head trials hav e compared budesonide/formoterol to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol. The trials varied in their design and the do ses of medications. In general , these head-to-head trials have failed to demonstrate that one product is consistent ly superior to the other. Some tr ials showed benefits for fluticasone propionate/salmeterol on some endpoints ( Dahl et al 2006, Fitzgerald et al 2005, Price et al 2007 ); some showed benefits for budesonide/formoterol ( Aalbers et al 2004, Palmqvist et al 2001 ), and another showed no significant differences between the 2 products ( Busse et al 2008 ). A comparing fluticasone propionate/sa lmeterol 250/50 mcg twice daily vs varied doses of budesonide/formoterol twice daily failed to demonstrate significant differences in exac erbations, asthma-related serious adverse events, FEV 1, rescue medication use, symptom s cores, or peak expiratory flo w (Lasserson et al 2011 ). 217 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/SS-U/ALS Page 6 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A head-to-head trial comparing mometasone/formoterol to flutica sone propionate/salmet for the primary endpoint of FEV 1 area under the curve (AUC) (0 to 12 hr) (Bernstein et al 2011 ). Treatment with mometasone/formoterol demonstrated a rapid on set of action, with significantly greater effects on FEV 1 at all time points up to 30 minut es post-dose compared to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol. Other secondary endpoints were no t significantly different betw een groups. A head-to-head trial comparing mcg twice daily demonstrated no significant differences between treatments on the primary endpoint, the wm FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr) (Woodcock et al 2013). There were also no signifi cant differences in ke y secondary endpoints, including the time to onset of b ronchodilator effect, percentag e of patients obtaining 12% and 200 mL increase from baseline in FEV 1 at 12 hours and 24 hours, and ch ange from baseline in trough F EV1. Another trial fluticasone furoate/vilanterol even ing trough FEV 1 at week 24 ( Bernstein et al 2018 ). ICS/LABA compared to tiotropium o r in combination with tiotropi um for COPD A double-blind, double-dummy, 2-y ear trial (N = the use of fluticasone prop ionate/salmeterol 250/50 mcg twice daily to tiotropium 18 mcg daily in patients with COP D (Wedzicha et al 2008 ). This trial demonstrated no significant difference between gr oups in the rate of exacerbati ons or post-dose FEV 1. The study demonstrated higher mortality in the tiotropium gr oup (6%) compared to the fluticas one propionate/salmeterol group (3%). This study was limited by the high number of wit hdrawals, which were unevenly distributed between the study arms. A double-blind, double-dummy, 12-week trial (N = 494) compared the umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 mcg daily to tiotropium 18 mcg daily in pat ients with COPD who had been t reated with tiotropium monotherapy at the time of enrollment ( et al 2017a ). The primary endpoint, trough FEV 1, showed improved efficacy in the group that stepped up to combination therapy, with a between-group difference of 8 8 mL (95% CI, 45 to 131; p < 0 .001). Improvements with umeclidinium/vilanterol were also observed in some secondary en dpoints, including the use of rescue medication use and transition dyspnea index (TDI) score. A double-blind, double-dummy, 12-w eek trial (N = 623) evaluated the use of fluticasone fur oate/vilanterol 100/25 mcg daily and tiotropium 18 mcg in patients with moderate-to- severe COPD and an increa sed cardiovascular risk (Covelli et al 2016 ). There was no significant di fference in the primary endpoint, the change from baseline in wm FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr). Minor differences were noted in some secondary effic acy endpoints and in the safety profiles. Pneumonia occurred more frequently in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol group, and 2 patients in the ti otropium group died following cardiovascular events. The duration of this trial was not long enough to allow any firm conclus ions about the relative efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol vs tiotro pium. In a Cochrane review that included the Covelli et al 2016 trial and 1 additional 12 week trial comparing tiotropium to fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ( N = 880 across both trials), there were no differences between treatments when considering the following outcomes: mortality, COPD exacerbatio n, pneumonia, St. George's resp iratory questionnaire (SGRQ) score, hospital admissions , or use of rescue medication (Sliwka et al 2018 ). Several trials have evaluated the potential benefits of adding a combination ICS/LABA to tiotropium vs the use of tiotropium alone in patients with COPD. These trials generally demonstrated an improvement in FEV 1 and some other lung function, symptom score, and quality-of-life endpoints ( Hanania et al 2012, Lee et al 201 6, Rojas-Reyes et al 2016, Welte et al 2009 ). Some trials ( Lee et al 2016, Welte et al 2009 ) also demonstrated a redu ction in the risk of COPD exacerbations or severe exacerbations; however, other trials an d a meta-analysis have no t confirmed a significant benefit for exacerbations ( Aaron et al 2007, Hanania et al 2012, Karn er et al 2011, Rojas-Reyes et al 2016 ). Beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic combinations for COPD Comparisons of combination beta 2-agonist/anticholiner gic products to bronchodilator monotherapy : Numerous trials have compared the combination beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic products to their respective individua l components as monotherapy, and in general, results have demonst rated that administration of the combination product is more effective than monother apy for improving lung function and/or achieving control of symptoms in COPD ( Beeh et al 2015, Bone et al 1994, Buhl et al 2015, Decramer et al 2014, Donohue et al 2013, Dorinsky et al 1999, Friedman et al 1999, Hanania et al 2017, Mahler et al 2015, Martinez et al 2017 ). A large, randomized-controlled trial (N = 7880) of patients wit h COPD and a history of exa cerbations did not find a difference in the rate of exacerbations between LAMA/LABA thera py with tiotropium/olodat erol [RR ( Calverley et al 2018 ). 218 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/SS-U/ALS Page 7 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A systematic review of 23 studies of beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic combinations compared to their monocom ponents and to other single-agent treatments in patients with COPD was cond ucted ( Price et al 2016 ). The analysis demonstrated that beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic combinat ions significantly improved lu ng function compared to their individual components. These combinations generally improved other outcomes compared to monotherapies as well, including symptoms and health status, but there were some discrepancies b etween lung function results and these patient- reported outcomes. A systematic review and networ k meta-analysis (N = 74 trials; 74,832 participants) evaluated the efficacy SAMAs, LABAs, LAMA/LABAs L ABA/ICSs for mainte nance treatment of CO PD. At 12 and 24 weeks , LAMA, LAMA/LABAs, and LABA/ICSs led to a significant ly greater improvement in tro ugh FEV 1 compared with placebo and SAMA monotherapy. With the exception of aclidinium/formoterol, all other LAMA/LABA therapies were superior to LAMA monotherapy and LABA /ICS therapy in impr oving trough FEV 1. Furthermore, LAMA/LABA therapy had the highest probability of being the best treatment for in FEV 1 improvement; similar trends were observed for the transition dy spnea index and SGRQ sco res. Authors concluded t hat there were no significant differences among the LAMAs and LAMA/LABAs within their respective classes ( Aziz et al 2018 ). A systematic review and meta-ana lysis (N = 8 trials) compared t iotropium 5 or 18 mcg with LAMA/LABA therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD; ICS therapy was also all owed and use ranged from 33.7% to 54.4% among included trials. Therapy with L ABA/LAMA was superior to tiotropium monotherapy for all of t he following outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks: FEV 1 peak and trough, SGRQ responder r ate, mean SGRQ score, and use of rescue medication. At 12 weeks, LABA/LAMA improved FEV 1 trough by 63 ml compared to tiot ropium alone (95% CI, 39.2 to 86.8; p < 0.01). During the same time period, LABA/ LAMA improved mean SGRQ responder rate by 19% (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.28; p < 0.01) and reduced SGRQ total score by 1.87 points (95 % CI, -2.72 to -1.02; p < 0. 01) compared to tiotropium (Han et al 2018). Comparisons of combination beta 2-agonist/anticholiner gic products to each other or to other bronchodilator combinations Two head-to-head trials between different LAMA/LABA combination s have been published. al 2017 ). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in trough FEV 1, was shown to be greater for umeclidinium/vilanterol, with a d ifference of 52 mL ( 95% CI, 28 to 77; p < 0.001 for superiority in the intention-to-treat population). Ef fects on secondary endpoi nts were mixed, with umeclidinium/vilanterol demonstr ating a small improvement in rescue medication use but no significant differences in COPD Assessment Test (CAT) scores (a health status questionnair e) or EXACT Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS) scores at most weekly assessments. Two 12-week, double-blind, cross over trials to Anoro Ellipta patients with (Kerwin et al 2017 ). The primary endpoint, FEV 1 AUC (0 to 24 hr), was similar between treatment arms in both studies, with differences for glycopyrrolate/indacaterol vs umeclidinium/vilanterol of -11.5 mL (95% CI, -26.9 and -18.2 mL (95% CI, -34.2 to -2.3) in Studies 1 and 2, respectively. Although the trials failed to demonstrate noninfe riority of glycopyrrolate/indacaterol to umeclidinium/vilanterol due to the noninferiority margin used i n the study methodology, t he differences between treatments were not considered clinically meaningful. A 12-week, non-inferiority, rand omized, double-blind, triple-du mmy, parallel group st udy (N = 967) compared umeclidinium/vilanterol (62.5/25 mcg once daily) to tiotropium (18 mcg once daily) plus ind acaterol (150 mcg once daily) (Kalberg et al 2016 ). When comparing trough FEV 1 on day 85, umeclidinium/vilanter ol demonstrated non-inferiorit y to combination treatment with tiotropium and indacaterol. Other me asures, including rescue medication use, TDI focal scores, and SGRQ scores, were also similar between both treatme nt groups on day 85 (p values not provided). A meta-analysis of 26 randomized controlled trials comparing th e efficacy of umeclidinium/vilanterol, indacaterol/glycopyrrolate, formoterol plus tiotropium, alone found idinium/vilanterol was compara ble to other LAMA/LABA fixed-dose combination agents with respect to trough FEV 1, SGRQ scores, TDI focal scores , and need for rescue medication use ( Huisman et al 2015 ). Three systematic reviews/meta-a nalyses various LAMA/LABA combinations ( Calzetta et al Schlueter et al 2016, Sion et al 2017 ). Limitations to these analyses included the fa ct that trials evaluated some formulations/dose regimens not available in the U.S., and comparisons between dif ferent combinations were based on indirect data. Overall, these meta-analyses demonstrated that all LAMA/LABA co mbinations showed improved lung function vs monocomponents, with few differ ences among products across lung function and patient-reported endpoints. 219 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/SS-U/ALS Page 8 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The analysis by Sion et al noted that both Utibron Neohaler (glycopyrrolate/indacaterol) and Anoro Ellipta (umeclidinium/vilanterol) appeared to improve function to a greater extent than Stiolto Respimat (tiotropium/olodaterol) at 12 weeks, with differences in trough FEV 1 of 52 mL (95% credible in terval [CrI], 18 to 86) and 38 mL (95% CrI, 13 to 63), respectively. The Schlueter et al meta-analysis included 27 trials (N = 30,361) including 4 LAMA /LABA fixed-dose combination agents (aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 efficacy, exacerbations, and discontinuation rates ( Schlueter et al 2016 ). Safety profiles were also similar among the products. ICS/LABA compared to LAMA/LA BA combinations for COPD A randomized, = daily to fluticasone propionate/salmeter ol 500/50 mcg twice daily in patients with moderate to severe COPD and no exacerbations in the previous year ( Singh et al 2015 ). It should be noted that the dos e of fluticasone propionate w as higher than what is recommended in the U.S. for treatment of COPD. Treatment with umeclidinium/vilanterol resulted in greater improvement in lung function than fluticasone propionat e/salmeterol, with a differenc e of 80 mL (95% CI, 46 to 113) in the wm FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr) and a difference of 90 mL (95% CI, 55 to 125) in trough FEV 1. Effects on rescue bronchodilator use, m ean TDI focal score, and SGRQ total scores , and the incidence of adverse events, were similar between groups. Two randomized, double-blind, 12-week trials (N = 707 and N = 7 00; reported together) compared umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 mcg daily to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 mcg tw ice daily in patients with moderate to severe COPD without e xacerbations in the previous y ear (Donohue et al 2015 ). These trials also demonstrated a greater improvem ent in lung function endpoints for umeclidinium/vilanterol compared to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol, with differences in wm FEV 1 (0 to 24 hr) and trough FEV 1 ranging from 74 to 101 mL (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Adverse e vent rates and effects on TDI sc ore and SGRQ were similar between groups. A randomized, double-blind, 26-week N dai ly in patients with COP D and a history of 1 exacerbation during t he previous year ( Vogelmeier et al ). The dosing regimens for indacaterol/glycopyrrolate and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol evaluated in this study are d ifferent from those availabl e and/or recommended for COPD in the U.S. The primary endpoint, FEV 1 AUC (0 to 12 hr), was significantly higher with indacaterol/glycopyrrolate than fluticasone propionate/salme terol, with a treatment differ ence of 138 mL (95% CI, 100 to 176; p < 0.0001). Benefits were also seen for indacaterol/ glycopyrrolate for some secondary endpoints, including additional lung function measures, change from baseline in rescue medication use, and TD I focal score; the difference in SGRQ was not statistically significant. A large, randomized, double-blin d, dai ly in patients with COP D and a history of 1 exacerbation during t he previous year ( Wedzicha et al 2016 ). Again, these dosing regimens varied from U.S. recommendations. The primary end point, the annual rate of all C OPD exacerbations, was 11% lower in the indacaterol/glycopyrrolate grou p in the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol group .03; rate CI, 0.83 to 0.96; p = 0.003). Lung function was also improved t o a greater extent with indacat erol/glycopyrrolate, with a difference in trough FEV 1 of 62 mL between gr oups (p < 0.001). A randomized, double-blind, crossov er trial (N = 229) the use of tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 mcg mcg tients with moderate to severe COPD; each patient recei ved each of the 4 treatments for 6 weeks separated by 3 -week washout periods ( Beeh et al 2016 ). The lower dose of each combination is the dose available/rec ommended for COPD in the U.S. The primary endpoint, FEV 1 AUC (0 to 12 hr), was greater fo r the tiotropium/olodaterol re gimens (range, 295 to 317 mL) than for the fluticasone propionate/salmeter ol regimens (range, 188 to 192 m L) (p < 0.0001). FEV 1 AUC (12 to 24 hr) and FEV 1 AUC (0 to 24 hr) also favored tiotr opium/olodaterol. Rates of adver se events were similar among the treatments. Triple combination for COPD Fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol is the first FDA-ap proved - an inhaler containing 3 active ingredients: an ICS, a LAMA, and a LABA. FDA approval wa s based primarily on the coadministration of umeclidinium plus the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination. 220 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/SS-U/ALS Page 9 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Two 12-week randomized studies (N = 619 and N = 620; published together) evaluated the efficacy and safety of double-blind treatment with umeclid inium 62.5 mcg, umeclidinium studies, the pr imary endpoint, trough FEV 1, was significantly improved with the addition of umeclidinium, with improvements ranging from 111 to 128 mL (p < 0.001 for all comparisons vs placebo). Improv ement was also demonstrated on t he secondary endpoint of wm FEV 1 (0 to 6 hr), with improvements ranging from 125 to 153 mL (p < 0.001 for all comp arisons vs placebo). SGRQ results were inconsistent. No substantial benefit was observ ed with umeclidinium 125 mcg o ver 62.5 mcg, which is cons istent with findings in the umeclidinium monotherapy studies. Once-daily triple therapy with fluticasone The formulation/dosing regimen of budesoni de/formoterol in this trial is d ifferent from the formulation available in the U.S. The trial demonstrated improvements in the change from baseline in trough FEV 1 (difference, 171 mL; 95% CI, 148 to 0.001), rate moderate/severe exacerbations ( rate ratio, 95% CI, 0.49 t o 0.86; p = 0.002). Although th e comparator regimen is not available in the U.S., this tr ial further supports the efficacy of triple inhaler th erapy with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol. Once-daily a 52-week, among patient s with COPD (IMPACT; Lipson et al 2018 ). The primary endpoint of moderat e or severe exacerbations was significantly lower w ith triple therapy in comparisons both with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.81 ). The annual rate of severe exacerbation resulting in hospitalization was also significantly lower with triple therapy vs umeclidinium/vilanterol (rate ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.78), but not vs fluticasone fu roate/vilanterol. The mean chan ge from baseline in trough FEV 1 was significantly increased with triple therapy by 97 and 54 mL vs fluticasone fu roate/vilanterol and umeclidin ium/vilanterol, respectively. The risk of pneumonia was signifi cantly higher with triple ther apy vs umeclidinium/vilanterol (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.92), but not vs fluticasone fur oate/vilanterol. Significant i mprovements in SGRQ total scor es also occurred with triple vs furoate/v (mean difference, -1.8 ; 95% CI, -2.6 to -1.0). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Asthma The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) gu ideline from the NHLBI s tates that the initial treatment of asthma should correspond to the appropriate asthma severity category, and it provides a stepwise approach to asthma management. Long -term control medications su ch as ICS, long-acting br onchodilators, leukotriene modifiers, cromolyn, theophylli ne, and immunomodulators should be taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent a sthma. ICS are the most potent and consistently effective long-term asthma control medication. Quick-relief medica tions such as SABAs and anticholinergics are used to p rovide prompt relief of bronchoconstriction and accompany ing acute symptoms such as cou gh, chest tightness, and wheezing. Systemic corticosteroids are important in the treatment of moderate or severe exacerbations because these medications prevent progression of the exacerbation , speed recovery, and prevent re lapses ( NHLBI 2007 ). LABAs are used in combination wi th ICS for long-term control and prevention of symptom s in moderate or severe persistent asthma. Of the adjunctive treat ments available, a LABA is the preferred option to combine with an IC S in patients 12 years of age and older. This combination is also an option in selected patients 5 to 12 years of age. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guideline also provides a stepwise approach to asthma management. It recommends an ICS as a preferred controller medication choice, with an increased ICS dose and/or addition of a LABA for increasing symptom severity (higher steps). At the highest step, it is recommended that the patient be referred for add-on asthma guidelines are generally similar; however, one difference among them is the recommendation of ICS/formoterol as both maintenan ce and rescue t herapy by the GI NA guidelines. The NHLBI do not recommend LABA medications for the management o f acute asthma symptoms or exacerbations ( GINA 2018, NHLBI 2007). A meta-analysis of 16 randomized c ontrolled trials evaluating the use of a LABA/ICS as single maintenance and reliever therapy found that it was associated with a significan t reduction in the risk of ast hma exacerbations compared 221 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/SS-U/ALS Page 10 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Of the 16 trials, 15 studied budesoni de/formoterol in a dry powder inhaler. Results were simi lar in comparisons with doses of ICS and LABA controller therapy that were higher than the combined LABA/ICS, and in comparison with ICS controller therapy only. COPD The 2019 GOLD guidelines state that the management strategy for stable COPD should be p redominantly based on an assessment of the patient's sympt oms and risk of exacerbations; the risk of exacerbations is based on a patient's exacerbation history. Key recom mendations from the GOLD guideli nes are as follows ( GOLD 2019 ): Inhaled bronchodilators are central to symptom management in CO PD and commonly given on a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms. Inhaled bronchodilators are reco mmended over oral bronchodilators. LAMAs and LABAs significantly improve lung function, dyspnea, a nd health status, and reduce exacerbation rates. LAMAs and LABAs are preferred over short-acti ng agents except for patients with onl y occasional dyspnea. LAMAs have a greater effect on ex acerbation reduction compared to LABAs and decrease hospitalizations. Patients may be started on single long-acting bronchodilator th erapy or dual long -acting bronchod ilator In patients with persistent dyspn ea on 1 bronchodilator, treatment should be escalated to 2 bronchodilators. Combination treatment with a LABA and LAMA: Reduces exacerbations compared to monotherapy or ICS/LABA. Increases FEV 1 and reduces symptoms compared to monotherapy. Long-term monotherapy with ICSs is not recommended. Long-term t reatment with ICSs may be considered in association with LABAs for patient s with a history of exacerbat ions despite treatment with long-acting bronchodilators. Triple inhaled therapy of LAMA/LABA/ICS improves lung function, symptoms, and health status and reduces exacerbations compa red to ICS/LABA or L AMA monotherapy. Treatment recommendations are given for patients with COPD based on their GOLD patient group (see Table 3 below). Group A: Patients should be offered bronchodilator treatment (s hort- or long-acting), based on its effect on breathlessness. This should be co ntinued if symptomatic benefit is documented. Group B: Initial therapy should consist of a long- acting bronch odilator (LAMA or LABA). For p atients with persistent on monotherapy, use of 2 bronchodilators is reco mmended (LAMA + LABA). F or patients with severe breathlessness, initial therapy with 2 bronchodilators m ay be considered. If t he addition of a second bronchodilator does not improve symptoms, it is suggested that treatment could be stepped down to a single bronchodilator; switching to anot her device or molecules can al so be considered. Group C: Initial therapy should be a LAMA. Patients with persis tent exacerbations may benefit from adding a second long-acting bronchodilator (LAMA + LABA, preferred) or using an ICS + LABA. For patients who have a history and/or findings suggestive of asthma-COPD overlap or bl ood eosinophil count 300 cells/\u00b5L, ICS + LABA is preferred. Group D: In general, it is recomm ended to start therapy with a LAMA. For patients with more severe symptoms, especially dyspnea and/or exercise limitation, LAMA/LABA may be considered for initial treatment. In some patients, initial therapy with an ICS + LABA may be the first c hoice; these patients ma y have a history and/or findings suggestive of asthma-COPD overlap or blood eosinophil count 300 cells/\u00b5L. In patients who develop further exacerbations on LAMA + LABA therapy, alternative pathw ays include escalation to a LAMA + LABA + ICS (preferred) or a switch to an ICS + LABA. If patients treated w ith a LAMA + LABA + ICS still have exacerbations, options for selected patients may include addition of roflumilast, addition of a macrolide , or stopping the ICS. Table 3.

SAFETY SUMMARY Beta 2-agonist/corticosteroid combinations Beta 2-agonist/ICS combinations are generally contraindi cated for the primary treatment of statu s asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma/COPD whe re intensive measures are required. Br eo Ellipta in patients with a sev ere hypersensitivity to milk proteins. Previously, ICS/LABA combinations had a boxed wa rning about an increased risk of asthma-related death, which had been observed with the LABA salmeterol. However, the boxed warn ing was removed from the prescribing information for ICS/LABA combinations in De cember 2017 based on an FDA revi ew of 4 large clinical safety trials, which demonstrated that these combinat ions do not result in a signifi cantly increased risk of asthma-related death, hospitalizations, or the need fo r intubation compared to ICS al one. There is still a warning/pr ecaution in the prescribing information of ICS/LABA combinat ions related to the increased r isk of asthma-related deat h with LABA monotherapy. A description of the clinical safet y trials with IC S/LABA combina tions has been added to the prescribing information for these products ( FDA 2017 ). Other key warnings and precautions include: Significant cardiovascular effect s and fatalities with excessiv e use of beta 2-agonists Cardiovascular and/or central ner vous system effects from beta- ess, headache, malaise, and insomnia) Paradoxical bronchospasm Hypercorticism and adre nal suppression due to systemic absorpti on of the corticosteroid The need for caution when transfe rring patients from systemic c orticosteroid therapy (deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred) Lower respiratory tract i nfections/pneumonia Local infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans Reduced growth velocity in pediatric patients The potential for drug interacti ons with strong CYP3A4 inhibito rs; concomitant use is not recommended due to the potential for increased systemic effects The potential for developing glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, blurred vision, central serous chorioretinopathy, or cataracts Immunosuppression Hypersensitivity Reduction in bone mineral density It is also important to note t hat ICS/LABA combinations should not be initiated in the setting of disease deterioration or potentially life-thre atening episodes. Commonly reported adverse events ( 5% for at least 1 medication in the class) include oral candidiasis, hoarseness/dysphonia, nasopharyngitis/pharyngitis, pharyngolary ngeal/oropharyngeal pain, sinusitis, ry tract inflammation, bronchit is, cough, headache, gastroi ntestinal discomfort, and nausea/vomiting. Beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic combinations Both albuterol/ipratropium products are contraindic ated in patients with hyperse nsitivity to atropine or its derivatives. Anoro Ellipta is cont raindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of the product, as well as in patients with sever e hypersensitivity to milk proteins. Beve spi Aerosphere, Stiolto Respima t, and Utibron Neohaler are all contraindicated in patients with asthma without use of a lo ng-term asthma control medication (and are not indicated for the treatment of asthma). 223 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/SS-U/ALS Page 12 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

There are no boxed warnings for t he albuterol/ipratropium combi that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related death. Data from a large placebo-controlled U.S. trial that compared the safety of anothe r LABA (salmeterol) with placebo added to usual asthma t herapy showed an increase in ast hma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol. This finding with salmeterol is considered a class effect of al l LABA, including formoterol (an active ingredient in Bevespi Aerosphere), ac tive ingredient in (an active ingredient in Anoro Ellipta), and olodaterol (an active ingredient i n Stiolto Respimat). The safe and Stiolto Respimat, and Utibron N eohaler patients with asthma have not been established, a nd these products are not indicated for the treatment of asthma. Warnings and precautions are ver y similar among products, and include the following: Paradoxical bronchospasm: May produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which can be life-threatening. If it occurs, the product should be discontinued and alternative therapy institut ed. Cardiovascular effect: Beta 2-agonists can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in so me patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or sym ptoms. If these symptoms occur, the product may need to be discontinued. In addition, electrocardiogram ( ECG) changes may occur. These p roducts should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, espec ially coronary insufficiency, ca and other anticholin ergic agents may increase intraocular press ure, which may precipitate or worsen narrow-angle glaucoma . They should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. In addition, patients should avoid spraying product into eyes, as this can cause eye pain and visual symptoms. Urinary retention: Ipratropium and other anticho linergic agents may cause urinary retenti on. Caution is advised when administering to patients with p rostatic hyperplasia or bladder -neck obstruction. The recommended dose should not be exceeded: Fatalities have be en reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma. . a reaction occurs, th erapy should be discont inued and alternative treatment considered. Coexisting conditions: Due to the beta 2-agonist component, cautio n is advised in pat ients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus, and in patients who are unusually responsive to s ympathomimetic amines. Hypokalemia: -agonists may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Drug interactions with strong C YP3A4 inhibitors; increased card iovascular effects may oc cur (Anoro Ellipta only). Reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy (Anoro Ellipta only). Deterioration of disease and a cute episodes; drug has not been studied in this setting and is not to relieve acute symptoms (Anoro Ellipta and Stiolto Respimat only). Adverse reactions are similar a mong products and include back p ain, bronchitis, upper respiratory infection, lung disease, headache, dyspnea, nas opharyngitis/pharyngitis, and co ugh. In a 12-week trial comparing Co mbivent Respimat to Combivent in halation aerosol, rates of adverse reactions were very similar between groups. In a 48-week safety trial, most adverse reactions were simila r in type and rate between treatment groups; however, cough occurred more frequently in pa tients enrolled in the Combivent Respimat group (7%) than the Combivent inhalation The choice of a specific LAMA/LABA fixed-dose combination product is not based on any difference in the safety profile (Matera et al 2016). Triple combination (beta 2-agonist/anticholinergic/corticosteroid) Trelegy Ellipta is contraindicat ed in patients wi th severe hype rsensitivity to milk proteins or any ingredients in the formulation. Similar to other combination agents for COPD (and/or asthma), Trelegy Ellipta has a number of additional warnings and precautions; these include: Increased risk of asthma-related death Not indicated for treatment of asthma Not initiating in patients wi th rapidly deteriorating COPD Avoiding excessing use Local effects of ICS 224 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/SS-U/ALS Page 13 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION Table 4. Dosing and Administration Drug Available Formulations Route Usual Recommended Frequency Beta 2-agonist & See the current prescribing information for full details. CONCLUSION Respiratory medications, including bronchodilators and corticos teroids, are a m ainstay of treatment for asthma and COPD, and a large amount of clinic al evidence supports the safe ty and efficacy of combination beta 2-agonist agents for these indications. Clinical trials have demonstrat ed that the combination products superior efficacy compared with the individual separate components when given as monotherapy for the treatment of both asthma and COPD. The combination products are generally well tolerated. Several single-ingredient inhalers containing beta 2-agonists, ICS, or anticholinergi cs are also available. Beta 2-agonist combinations offer improved conv enience over the use of multiple separate inhalers. Trelegy Ellipta is the first fixed-dose combination inhaler com bining a LAMA, a LABA, and an ICS, and provides an alternative to the use of multi ple inhalers for patients with COPD in whom triple therapy is indicated. 225 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/SS-U/ALS Page 14 of 18 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

GINA guidelines suppor t the use of combination ICS/LABA product s for long-term control and prevention of symptoms in patients with asthma who do not achieve sufficient symptom cont rol with ICS monotherapy. Single-agent LABA therapy should not be used for asthma managem ent due to the increased risk of asthma-related death, as well as asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric a nd adolescent patients. How ever, recent drug safety information from the FDA states that no significantly increased risk of serious asthma out comes has been seen with the use of ICS/LABA combinatio ns, and boxed warnings about this potential risk have been removed from the prescribing information for the ICS/LABA combinations. An advantage of the ICS/LABA comb inations is that their use ens ures that patients are no t using a LABA without a concomitant ICS. GOLD guidelines recomme nd the use of combination ICS/LABA produ cts as an option for some patients at higher risk of exacerbations, a history and/or fi ndings suggestive of asthma-C OPD overlap, or blood eosin ophil count 300 cells/\u00b5L; however, the use of 1 or more bro nchodilator without an ICS is recommended as first-line treatment for most COPD patients. A LAMA is recommended as first-li ne treatment in most patients with COPD, with the except ion of low-risk patients with milder symptoms, or patient s with more severe symptoms. None of the current asthma or COPD treatment guidelines recomme nd the use of one specific combination product over another. Administration instructions and inhalation devices vary among products and should be considered in product selection. REFERENCES Aalbers R, Backer V, Kava TT, e t al.

Therapeutic Class Overview Respiratory Corticosteroids INTRODUCTION Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are approved by t he Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of asthma. These agents are effective in the treatment of asthma due to th eir wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells and eos inophils) and mediators (e.g., h istamine and cytokines) involved in the asthmatic response. Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing, che st tightness, shortness of br eath, and coughing. Asthma affects people of all ages, but most often starts during chil dhood. In the United States, more than 25 million pe ople are known to have asthma, including about 7 million children ( National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI] 2014 ). The exact cause(s) of asthma ar e unknown. A combination of fact ors such as genetics, certa in respiratory infections during childhood, and contact with airborne allergens can contr ibute to its development. Most patients with asthma have allergies (NHLBI 2014 ). Current pharmacologic options for asthma management are categor ized as: (1) long-term control medications to achieve and maintain control of persisten t asthma, and (2) quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms and exacerbations (NHLBI 2007 ). Long-term control medications include ( NHLBI 2007 ): Corticosteroids (ICSs for long-term control; short courses of o ral corticosteroids to gain prompt control of disease, long-term oral corticosteroids for severe persistent asthma) Cromolyn Short-acting -agonists (SABAs) as the therapy of choice for re lief of acute symptoms and prevention of exercise- induced bronchospasm Anticholinergics (i.e. ipratropium bromide) as an alternative b ronchodilator for th ose not tolerating a SABA Systemic corticosteroids, although not short-acting, are used f or moderate and severe exace rbations as part of initial treatment. In recent years, additional medi cations have been made availabl e for select subsets of patie nts with asthma, the interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagoni sts mepolizumab, and reslizumab, and the (IL-4) antagonist dupilumab, for the management of s used for COPD, has been FDA- approved for the treatment of asthma ( Spiriva Respimat prescribing information 2018 ). ICSs are the most effective and most commonly recommended long- term control medications used for the treatment of asthma. The LABAs should not be us ed as monotherapy for the man agement of asthma due to increased risk for serious adverse events including death. However, they are effec tive adjunctive therapy in patients who are not adequately controlled with an ICS alone . Theophylline and mast- cell stabilizers have weak to low efficacy in asthma. Theophylline has an unfav orable side-effect profile and may be life-threatening at h igh doses. Mast-ce ll stabilizers have a more favorable safety profile . Tiotropium is an option for add-on therapy in patients with a history of exacerbations. An IL-5 antagonist or the immunogl obulin E (IgE) antagonist, omali zumab, may be added if patient s require a higher level of care. Omalizumab is used in pat ients with moderate to severe al lergic asthma while IL-5 antagonists are used for severe eosinophilic asthma. SABAs are the medication of choice for the relief of bronchospasm during acute exacerbations of asthma ( Fasenra prescribing information NHLBI 2007, Global Initiative [GINA] 2018 ). This review includes single-agent ICSs (ie, r espiratory cortico steroids). While respiratory c orticosteroids are commonly available in combination with other bronchodilators such as LAB As, combination agents are not included within this 231 Data as of November 16, 2018 KS-U/LK-U/ALS Page 2 of 10 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Although inflammation is a lso a component of COPD patho genesis, no single-entit y ICS has been FDA- approved for use in COPD ( Global Initiative for Chronic Ob structive Lung Disease [GOLD] 2019 ). Of note, QVAR new inhalation formulation of beclomethasone dipropionate manufactured by Teva, was approved by the FD A in August 2017 and was launche d in February 2018, replacing the previous QVAR product ( Teva 2018 ).

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Several trials demonstrate the efficacy of ICSs compared to pla cebo for preventing exacerbations, improving FEV 1 and peak expiratory flow (PEF), improving symptoms, reducing use of SABAs, reducing oral corticosteroid requi rements, 232 Data as of November 16, 2018 KS-U/LK-U/ALS Page 3 of 10 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Numerous head-to-head trials have compared various ICS regimens to one another. Several clinical trials demonstrated no significant differences between different ICSs: A trial comparing budesonide 750 mcg twice daily to fluticasone propionate 375 mcg twice daily in children 5 to 16 years of age demonstrated no stat istically significant differen ces between treatment group s in PEF, symptom scores, physician/patient/parent assessment of efficacy, or frequency of exacerbations ( Fitzgerald et al 1998 ). A trial comparing fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily to various doses of mometa sone furoate twice daily demonstrated comparable efficacy between fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate for improvement in FEV 1, forced expiratory flow at 25 to 75% of forced vital capacity (FVC; i.e., forced expiratory flow [FEF] 25 to 75% ), and PEF ( et 2001 ). A trial comparing fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily to mometasone furoate 400 mcg every evening demonstrated no significant differences between groups in FEV 1, FVC, PEF, albuterol use, or asthma symptom scores ( Wardlaw et al 2004 ). A trial comparing fluticasone 500 mcg twice daily to mometasone furoate 500 mcg twice daily demonstrated no significant differences in PEF, FEV 1, symptom scores, or re scue albuterol use ( Harnest et al 2008). A trial comparing beclomethasone dipropionate 168 mcg twice dai ly to mometasone furoate 100 or 200 mcg twice daily demonstrated no significant differences in FEV 1, PEF, asthma symptoms, noctur nal awakenings, or albuterol use ( Nathan et al 2001 ). The beclomethasone product eva luated in the trial is no longer commercially available. A trial comparing ciclesonide 160 mcg every evening to budesoni de 400 mcg every evening in children aged 6 to 11 years demonstrated no significant differences between groups in FEV 1, morning PEF, asthma symptom score, or need for rescue medication ( Von Berg et al 2007 ). A trial comparing fluticasone furoate 100 mcg daily to placebo also included fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily as a reference arm; results seen between fluticasone for FEV 1, percentage days , and severe asthma exacerbatio ns (Lotvall et al 2014). A trial comparing fluticasone furoate 200 mcg daily to fluticas one propionate twice daily that fluticasone furoate was non-infer ior to fluticasone propionate based on effect on FEV 1 (O'Byrne et al 2014). Overall, comparative trials have not conclusively demonstrated one ICS to be significantly m ore effective than another. However, in several individual tr ials, significant differences in some endpoints were observed. For example, comparative trials have demonstrated: In a trial comparing fluticason e propionate 200 mcg twice daily to budesonide 400 mcg twice daily in children 4 to 12 years of age, patients treated with fluticasone propionate had superior results for mean morning PEF compared to patients receiving budesonide (271 \u00b1 82 and 259 \u00b1 75 L/minute, respectively, P=0.002) ( Ferguson et al 1999 ). In a trial comparing budesonide 200 mcg twice daily to fluticas one propionate 100 mcg twice daily in children 6 to 9 years of age, effectiveness meas ures were comparable between gr oups; however, the mean growth velocity was significantly greater in the flut icasone propionate group (5.5 cm/year) compared to t he budesonide group (4.6 cm/year) ( Ferguson et al 2007 ). A trial comparing beclomethasone dipropionate 168 or 336 mcg tw ice daily to fluticasone propionate 88 to 220 mcg twice daily demonstrated greater improvement in FEV 1 for fluticasone propiona te-treated patients. At 1 values in the low- and medium-dose fluticasone propionate groups improved by 0.31 (14%) and respectively, compared to improvements dipropionate treatment g respectively. superior in the fluticasone propionate g roup for FEF 25 PEF, use of albuterol ( Raphael et al 1999 ). Of note, the beclomethasone pr oduct evaluated in the trial i s no longer commercially available. In a trial comparing budesonide 4 00 mcg twice daily to various doses of mometasone furoate twice daily, the FEV 1 was significantly improved from baseline in the mometasone furo ate 200 and 400 mcg treatment groups compared to the budesonide treatment group. In addition, morning wheezing scores were significantly improved in the mometasone furoate 400 mcg twic e daily group compared to the bu desonide group, and patients treated with mometasone furoate 200 or 400 mc g twice daily required significantly less albuterol compared to patients treated with budesonide ( Bousquet et al 2000 ). In a trial comparing budesonide 400 mcg once daily to mometason e furoate 440 mcg once daily, the mometasone furoate group had superior result s for the percent change in FEV 1, FEF 25 to 75% , FVC, evening asthma symptom 233 Data as of November 16, 2018 KS-U/LK-U/ALS Page 4 of 10 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Meta-analyses have evaluated ci clesonide and mometasone furoate compared to other ICS agents: A meta-analysis comparing ciclesonide to other ICS agents (budesonide or fluticasone propionate) in children with asthma demonstrated no significa nt differences between cicleson ide and budesonide on asthma symptom scores, symptom-free days, rescue medica tion-free days, or exacerbation s. When ciclesonide and fluticasone propionate were compared, no significant di fferences were found in asthma symptoms or rescue medi cation-free days. One of the four studies of ciclesonide vs fluticasone propionate demonstrated a higher incidence of exacerbations with ciclesonide; however, the dose of fluticasone propi onate was re latively higher in this study ( Kramer et al 2013 ). A meta-analysis comparing budesonide, or flutic asone propionate) in patient s with moderate to severe asthma demonstrated superior results with mometasone furoate fo r pulmonary function measures (FEV 1, FVC, 25 to 75%, and morning PEF). Mometasone fu roate was also shown to be superior on some symptom indices (morning difficulty breathing scores and rescue medication use), but not others (morning wheez e scores, morning cough scores, and nocturnal awakening s). However, based on the pooled results for the comparative arms, it is not possible to make conclusions about the relative efficacy of mometasone f uroate compared to other individual agents ( Yang et al 2012 ). Fluticasone propionate has also been compared to a leukotriene receptor, montelukast, in several randomized controlled trials in both adults and children. Although differences were not detected for all endpoints, in general these trials demonstrated superior outcomes for fluticasone propionat e for FEV 1, symptom-free days, ast hma symptom scores, nighttime awakenings, rescue albuterol use, physician's global assessments, frequen cy of exacerbatio ns, and/or quality of life measures ( Busse et al 2001, Garcia et al 2005, Sorkness et al 2007, Szefler et al 2005, Zeiger et al 2006 ). The safety and efficacy of ArmonA ir RespiClick were evaluated in 2,130 patients with asthm a, including two 12-week confirmatory trials, a 26-week safety trial, and two dose-rangi ng trials. The efficacy of ArmonAir RespiClick is based primarily on the dose-ranging and confirmatory trials ( Bernstein et al 2017, Kerwin et al 2017, Mansfield et al 2017, Raphael el at 2017, Sher et al 2017 ). The first Phase 3 trial (n=647, of which 389 were randomized to ArmonAir RespiClick or placebo) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study that compared ArmonAir RespiClick 55 mcg and 113 one inhalation twice daily, and placebo in patients 12 years of ag e with persistent symptomatic asthma despite low-dose or mid-dose ICS or ICS/LABA t herapy. For the primary endpoint of change from baseline in trough FEV 1, a significantly greater improvem ent was seen in ArmonAir RespiClick 55 mcg and 113 mcg as c ompared to placebo at the end of 12 weeks (least squares means [LSM] change of 0.172 L, 0.204 L, and 0.053 L, r espectively). Secondary endpoints of weekly average of daily tr ough morning PEF, total daily use of rescue medication, and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire improvement were also evaluated and supporte d efficacy of ArmonAir RespiClick ( Raphael el at 2017 ). The second Phase 3 trial (n=728, of which 437 were randomized t o ArmonAir RespiClick or placebo) was similarly designed, but evaluated an incre ased ICS dose: ArmonAir mcg mcg, and placebo. Results for the primary endpoint of change from baseline in trough FEV 1 mirrored that of Trial 1, with si gnificantly greater improvemen t in the ArmonAir RespiClick 113 mcg and 232 mcg groups as compared to placebo a t the end of 12 weeks (LSM chang e of 0.119 L, 0.179 L, and -0.004 L, respectively). Secondary endpoints of weekly ave rage of daily trough morning P EF and total daily use of rescue medication also supported efficacy of ArmonAir RespiClick ( Sher et al 2017 ). The safety and efficacy of QVAR R ediHaler were evaluated in 1,8 58 patients with persist ent symptomatic asthma, including two 12-week and one 6- week Phase 3 confirmatory trial s in patients 12 years of age, and one 12-week Phase 3 confirmatory trial in pati ents 4 to 11 years of age ( Amar et al 2016, Hampel et al 2017, Vandewalker et al 2017 ). The (N=270) was doubl trial QVAR RediHaler 40 mcg and 80 mcg twice daily vs placebo in pati ents who previously us ed low-dose ICS or non- corticosteroid therapy. For the primary endpoint of change from baseline in trough FEV 1 area under the effect curve 0 to 12 weeks (AUEC 0-12wk), a significantly greater improvement was seen with QVAR RespiClick 80 mcg and 160 mcg as compared to placebo (differ ence of LSM from placebo of 0.124 L and 0.116 L, respectiv ely). Both doses of QVAR RediHaler demonstrated improvements in asthma control as supported by significantly greater improvements in morning PEF and a reduction in asthma symptoms vs placebo ( Hampel et al 2017 ). 234 Data as of November 16, 2018 KS-U/LK-U/ALS Page 5 of 10 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The second 12-week Phase 3 trial (n=532) was a randomized, 320 mcg twice daily vs QVAR 160 mcg and 320 mcg twice dai ly and placebo in patients who previously used mi d- to high-dose ICS or ICS/LABA therapy. The baseline-adjusted trough morning FEV 1 AUEC 0-12wk increased in all active treatment groups vs placebo, although the differences were not significant. Overall, the safety profiles o f QVAR and QVAR RediHaler were co and 320 mcg twice daily vs place bo, with a QVAR 160 mcg twice d aily reference arm, in pat ients previously using non-corticosteroid, ICS \u00b1 LABA, or combination asthma therapy. For the primary endpoint of change from baseline in trough FEV 1 AUEC 0-6wk, a significantly greater impro vement was with QVAR RespiC lick 160 mcg and 320 mcg vs placebo (difference of LSM fr om placebo of 0.144 L and 0.150 L, respectively). Both doses of QVAR RediHaler demonstrated improvements in as thma control as supported by significantly greater improvements in morning PEF, reduced rescue medication use, a nd a reduction in asthma sympto ms vs placebo, with simi lar results demonstrated with QVAR 160 mcg treatment mcg and 80 mcg twic e daily vs placeb o in patients who previously used non-cor ticosteroid or low-dose ICS \u00b1 LABA therapy. Treatment w ith the QVAR RediHaler did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference vs placebo for the primary endpoint of FEV 1 AUEC 0-12wk ; however, the change in weekly average of daily morning PEF was 11.3 L/min and 8.5 L/min for the 80 mcg /day and 160 mcg/day doses of QVAR RediHale r, respectively, with nominal significance (Vandewalker et al 2017 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) gu ideline from the NHLBI s tates that the initial treatment of asthma should correspond to the appropriate asthma severity category, and it provides a stepwise approach to asthma management. Long -term control medications su as ICSs, and immunomodulators should be taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent a sthma. ICSs are the most potent and consistently effective long-term asthma control medication. Quick-relief medica tions such as SABAs and anticholinergics are used to p rovide prompt relief of bronchoconstriction and accompany ing acute symptoms such as cou gh, chest tightness, and wheezing. Systemic corticosteroids are important in the treatment of moderate or severe exacerbations because these medications prevent progression of the exacerbation , speed recovery, and prevent re lapses ( NHLBI 2007 ). LABAs are used in combination wi th ICSs for long-term control a nd prevention of symptoms in moderate or severe persistent asthma. Of the adjunctive treat ments available, a L ABA is the preferred option to combine with an IC S in patients 12 years of age and older. This combination is also an option in selected p atients 5 to 12 years of age. The GINA guideline also provides a stepwise approach to asthma management. It recommends an ICS as a preferred controller medication choice, w ith an increased ICS dose and/or addition of a LABA for incr easing symptom severity (higher steps). At the highest s tep, it is recommended that the patient be referred for add-on treatment agents are generally contraindi cated in patients with hyper sensitivity to c omponents of the product. also patients with hypersensitivity to milk proteins. All ICSs are c ontraindicated as primary treatme nt of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required. ICSs have no boxed warnings. Key warnings and precautions are similar among products, and generally include: The occurrence of Candida albicans infections in the mouth and pharynx Eosinophilic conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression The risk of oral corticosteroid withdrawal or adrenal insuffici ency in patients transitioning from oral to ICS agents Paradoxical bronchospasm Reduction in bone mineral den sity with long-term use Reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients 235 Data as of November 16, 2018 KS-U/LK-U/ALS Page 6 of 10 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CONCLUSION ICS agents are considered the corn erstone of drug therapy for l ong-term asthma control. Consensus guidelines emphasize the important role of ICS agents as long -term control ler medications. The NHLBI and GINA asthma guidelines agree that ICSs are t he preferred treatment for init iating therapy in children and ad ults with persistent asthma. It is important to note that the current consensus guidelines d o not give preference to one ICS over another ( GINA 2018, NHLBI 2007 ). Although individual head-to-head cl inical trials have demonstrated some differences amo ng ICS agents on certain endpoints, results have not conc lusively demonstrated one agent to be significantly more e ffective than another in the management of asthma. Contraindications, warnings/precautions, and adverse effects are also similar among products. There are difference s among products with respect to their avai lable formulations, dosing schedule, and use in the pediatric population. Notably, som e products are available as d ry powder formulations, while others are available as inhalation aerosols. Most ICSs ar Respule s may be administered either on ce or twice daily. The appropriate choice of an ICS agent for an individual patien t may depend on eas e of use of the ICS device, dosing schedule, and contraindications s uch as hypersensitivity to milk proteins. The inhaler device is an impor tant component of treatment, and the patient's response, preference, and ability to use the inhaler device should be considered in product selection.

Therapeutic Class Overview Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Agents INTRODUCTION Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a subtype of pulmonary h ypertension (PH), is a chronic, life-threatening disease that is characterized by increased resistance in the pu lmonary circulation ca used by progressive pulmonary artery remodeling and constriction of the pulmonary vasculature ( Buckley et al 2013, Wu et al 2013 ). o PH is defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of 25 mmHg at rest. Normal pulmonary arterial systolic pressure ranges from 15 to 30 mmHg, diastolic pressure from 4 to 12 mmHg, and normal mPAP is 20 mmHg ( Rubin et al 2018 ). o PAH often manifests with clinical symptoms such as shortness o f breath and decreased functional capacity, and eventually leads to right h eart failure and death ( Gomberg-Maitland et al 2011 ). Early recognition of PAH is essential and the gold standard for the clinical diagnosis of PAH is right heart catheterization ( Buckley et al 2013 ). The World Health Organization (WHO ) classifies PH into 5 groups : o Group 1 - PAH o Group 2 - PH secondary to heart disease o Group 3 - PH secondary to lung diseases and/or hypoxia o Group 4 - Chronic thro mboembolic PH (CTEPH) o Group 5 - PH with unclear o r multifactorial etiologies WHO Group I encompasses PAH, inc luding idiopathic PAH, heritabl e PAH, drug- and toxin-induced PAH, and PAH associated with other disor ders such as connective tissue disease, portal hypertension, human immunodeficiency virus infecti on, congenital heart disease, and schistosomiasis ( Simonneau et al 2013 ). In addition to the diagnostic classification, patients may be s tratified according to their WHO functional capacity, which was adapted from the New Yo rk Heart Association (NYHA) classification of left heart failure. A brief description of these functional classes (FC) is as follows ( Stringham et al 2010 ): o Class I: No limitation of physical activity o Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity o Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity o Class IV: Inability to carry ou t any physical activity without symptoms The prevalence of WHO Group 1 PAH h as been estimated at 7 to 26 cases per million adults ( Pogue et al 2016 ). The disease has a poor prognosis and an approximate mortality r ate of 15% within 1 year on therapy ( McLaughlin et al 2009 ). The median survival in the 1980 s was 2.8 years; this had imp roved to 7 years in the late 2000s (Pogue et al 2016 ). CTEPH (WHO Group 4) is a leading cause of severe PH that result s from thrombus formation leading to fibrous stenosis or complete obliterat ion of pulmonary arteries. o The incidence of CTEPH is uncert ain, but it occurs in up to 4% of patients after an ac ute pulmonary embolism (Simonneau et al 2009 ). Specific agents to treat PAH prima rily target 3 pathways critic al to its pathobiology: the prostacyclin, endothelin, and nitric oxide pathways (Wu et al 2013 ). There are currently 10 mole cular entities within 5 therapeutic classes that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the tr eatment of PAH ( Lexicomp 2018 ). o Drugs active within the prostacyclin treprostinil) and a prostacyclin receptor agonist (oral selexipag). o Drugs active within the endothe lin pathway are the endothelin receptor antagonists (ER As) (oral ambrisentan, oral bosentan, and oral macitentan). o Drugs active within the nitric oxide pathway are the phosphodi esterase-type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (IV and oral sildenafil and oral and a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator (oral riociguat). The goals of treatment include im provement in the patient's sym ptoms, quality of life (QOL), and survival. The optimal therapy for a patient s hould be individualized, taking into acc ount many factors including se verity of illness, route of administration, side effects, c omorbid illness, treatment goals , and clinician preference ( McLaughlin et al 2009 ). 242 Data as of November 6, 2018 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 2 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients.

T he Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Initial management of PAH include s the use of warfarin, diuretics, and/or oxygen depending on t he patient's diagnosis and symptoms. Prior to the initia tion of advanced therapy, pati ents with PAH should undergo a vasoreactivity test. Oral calcium channel blockers (CC Bs) are indicated only for pat ients who have a positive acute vasodilator response to testing ( Gali\u00e8 et al 2015[b], McLaughlin et al 2009, Taichman et al 2014 ). For patients who do no t have a positive acute vasodilator respo nse to testing and are considered low to moderate risk based on clinical assessment, oral mono- or combination therapy with certain agents are recommended. These include ERAs, PDE-5 inhibitors, an sGC stimulator, and a prosta cyclin receptor (IP) agonist. In patients with high risk disease, continuous treatment w ith an IV PCA therapy (epoproste nol or treprostinil) would be recommended. Combination therapy may be cons idered if patients are not respo nding adequately to monotherapy or are not candidates for monotherapy ( Barst, 2009, Gali\u00e8 et al 2015[b], McLaughlin et al 2009, Taichman et al 2014 ). The PAH agents are FDA-approved fo r the treatment of patients w ith WHO Group I PAH; however, there are differences in the study populat ions for which their FDA-approv als were based (McLaughlin et al 2009 ). Adempas (riociguat) is a first-in -class sGC stimulator with a d ual mode of action involving endogenous nitric oxide that leads to increased generation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) with subsequent vasodilation. This agent has the additional FDA approval for treating adults with persis tent/recurrent CTEPH (WHO Group 4) after surgical treatment or inoperable CTEPH. A dempas is the first and only dr ug to be FDA-approved in the treatment of CTEPH. Pulmonary endarterectomy is curat ive for CTEPH, but it is techn ically demanding which may limit access to its use as a treatment ( Archer 2013 ). In PAH, prostacyclin synthase i s reduced resulting in inadequat e production of prostacyclin I 2, a potent vasodilator with antiproliferative effects and an inhibitor of platelet agg ( et al 2009 ). The PCAs, iloprost and treprostinil, were developed as chemically stable alternatives to epoprostenol, which requires continuous IV infusion due to its lack of stability ( Asaki et al 2015 ). Orenitram (treprostinil) is the first FDA-approved oral PCA. It may represent a more convenient dosage form to the other treprostin il formulations (Remodulin and Tyvaso). However, patients with more severe PAH are likely to receive infused PCA rather than oral therapy ( McLaughlin et al 2009). Among these agents, epo prostenol IV is the only agent that has demonstrated improved pati ent survival in high risk PAH patients (Gali\u00e8 et al 2015[b] ). Uptravi (selexipag) works a t the same pathway as the PCAs, b ut activates the IP receptor, also known as the prosta cyclin receptor. Orenitram an d Uptravi are the only ora lly administered agents that work within the prostacyclin pathway ( Asaki et al 2015 ). Endothelial dysfunction in PAH cau ses increased production of e ndothelin-1 resulting in vas oconstriction, which is mediated by the endothelin receptors, ET A and ET B. Stimulation of ET A causes vasoconstriction and cell proliferation, while stimulation of ET B results in vasodilatation, ant iproliferation and endothelin-1 [bosentan]) both re ceptors with different affinities. Letairis and Opsumit a re highly selective for the E TA receptor, while Tracleer is slightly selective for the ET A receptor over the ET B receptor. In addition, Opsumit has a pharmacolo gically active metabolite and is considered \"tissue-targeting\" because it d isplays high affinity and sustai ned occupancy at the ET rec eptors in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscles. However , the clinical significance of receptor affinities of the ERAs has not been established (McLaughlin et al 2009 ). In patients with PAH, there is a lso an impaired release of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium, thereby reducing cGMP concentrations. The PDE-5 e nzyme is the predominant phosph odiesterase in the pulmonary vasculature and is responsible for the degradation of cGMP. The PDE-5 inhibitors, Revatio (sildenafil) of the pulmo nary vascular bed.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Adcirca (tadalafil) Adcirca was evaluated in the PHIR ST study, a 16-week, randomize d, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial consisting of 405 patients with predominantly WHO FC II or III symptoms. T reatment with Adcirca signifi cantly improved exercise capacity, as measured by the 6MWD and reduced clinical worsenin g compared to placebo (Gali\u00e8 et al 2009 ). In a 52- week extension trial, PHIRST-2, the improvements in 6MWD obser ved at the end of PHIRST appeared to be maintained through week 52 of P HIRST-2 (68 weeks total). In add ition, 34% of patients enrolled in PHIRST-2 experienced an improvem ent in WHO FC compar ed to baseline of th e PHIRST trial ( Oudiz et al 2012 ). Adempas (riociguat) The efficacy and safety of Adempas were evaluated in CHEST-1, a multinational, multicenter, double-blind,16-week trial in 261 adult patients with CTEPH. The majority of patient s were WHO FC II (31%) or c lass III (64%). The primary endpoint of CHEST-1 was change from baseline in 6MWD after 16 w eeks. Secondary endpoint s included changes from baseline in pulmonary lar resistance (PVR), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic Borg dyspnea score, QOL var iables, and safety. Improvements in walking distance occurred beginning at week 2. At week 16, the placebo adjusted mean increase in 6MWD within the Adempas group was 46 m (95% confidence interval [CI], 25 m to 67 m; p < 0.001) CHEST-2 consisted of an 8-week, double-blind dose-adjustment ph ase, followed by an open-l abel study phase that continued until Adempas received official approval and became c ommercially available. A t the March 2013 cut-off date, 211 patients (89%) were receiving ongoing treatment, and 179 (76%) had received o ver 1 year of treatment. The safety profile of Adempas in CHEST-2 was similar to CHEST-1, with no new safety signals. Improvements in 6MWD and WHO FC observed in CHEST-1 persisted for up to 1 year in CHEST-2. In the observ ed population at 1 year, mean\u00b1standard devia tion (SD) 6MWD had changed by 51\u00b162 m (n = 172) versus CHEST-1 baseline (n = 237), and WHO FC had improved, sta bilized, or worsened in 47, 5 0, or 3% of patients (n = 176) versus CHEST-1 baseline (n = 236). Of patients treated for 1 year in CHEST-2, 145 (92%) out of 157 were continuing to receive monotherapy, and 12 (8%) patients were receiving additional PH-specific medication (8 [5% ] were receiving ERAs and 4 [3%] were receiving prostanoids). No patient required add itional treatment with bot h an ERA and prostanoid at 1 year (Simmoneau et al 2015). An exploratory analysis noted a significant association with overall survival for 246 Data as of November 6, 2018 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 6 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Additionally, short-term improvements were associated with long-term survival and worsening-free survival. At 2 years, the overall survival r ate was 93% (95% CI, 89 to 96%) and the rate of clinical worsening-free survival was 82% (95% CI, 77 to 87%) ( Simonneau et al 2016 ). Due to lack of a control group and because certain outcome s were considered exploratory, data from this study must be interpreted cautiously. The efficacy and safety of Adempa s were also evaluated in PATEN T-1, a multinational, multicenter, double-blind, 12- week trial in 443 adult patients with PAH as defined by PVR > 3 00 dyn*sec*cm-5 and a PAP mean > 25 mmHg. In this study, 50% of the patients were treatment-na\u00efve with respect to PAH therapy, 44% were pr e-treated with an ERA, and 6% were pretreated with a PCA ( inhaled, oral, or SC). Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 tr eatment groups: placebo (n = 126), an exploratory capped titration arm of Adempas 1.5 mg 3 times daily (n = 63), o r a capped maximum dose of Adempas 2.5 mg 3 times daily (n = 254). The primary endpoint of PATENT-1 was change from baseline in 6MWD after 12 weeks in the Adempas 2.5 mg group compared to placebo. Secondary endpoints in cluded changes from baseline in PVR, NT-proBNP dyspnea scor e, QOL variables, and safety. At week 12, the placebo-adjusted mean increase in 6MWD within the Adempas 2.5 mg treatment group was 36 m (95% CI, 20 m to 52 m, p < 0.001). The group receiving the capped dose at 1.5 mg was excluded from the efficacy analysis ( Ghofrani et al 2013[b] ). o An open-label, non-comparative, (PATENT-2) inc luded 396 patients PATENT-2 consisted of an 8-week, double-blind dose-adjustment p hase, followed by an op en-label study phase that continues until all patients have transitioned to the comm ercially available drug. A to tal of 197 patients received Adempas monotherapy and 199 received Adempas in combination wit h an ERA or prostanoid, or both. The primary objective of the study was to as sess the safety and tolerabilit y of long-term Adempas treatment. Assessments took place at entry to PATENT-2, a t weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12, and ev ery 3 months thereafter . At the March 2013 data cut-off, 324 patients (82%) were receiving ongoing treatment an d 84% had received 1 year or more of treatment. Mean treatment duration was 95 we eks (median 91 weeks), and cum ulative treatment expos ure was 718 patient- years (Rubin et al 2015). An expl oratory analysis concluded tha t there was a significant association between overall survival and 6MWD, NT-proBNP c oncentration, and WHO FC at basel ine (p = 0.0006, 0.0225, and 0.0191, respectively), and at follow-up 0.0056, and 0.0048, respectively). Additionally , short-term improvements were associated with long-term survival and worsening-free surv ival. The estimated surviv al rate was 97% (95% CI, 95 to 98%) and rate of clinical w orsening-free survival was 88% (95% CI, 85 to 91%) a t 1 year and 79% (95% CI, 74 to 82%) at 2 years ( Ghofrani et al 2016 ). Certain outcomes were considered exploratory, so data from t his study must be interpreted cautiously. Flolan (epoprostenol) The safety and efficacy of chroni cally-infused Flolan were eval uated in 2 similar, trials of 8 to12 weeks' duration comparing conventional therapy (eg, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, diuretics, digoxin, oxygen) with conventional therapy alone in idiopathic or heritable PAH (NYHA Class II to IV) patients (n = 106). The average Flolan dose was 9.2 ng/kg/min at the trials' end. A statistically signi ficant improvement was observed in the 6MWD in patients receiving Flolan plus conventi onal therapy for 8 to 12 weeks compared with those receiving conventional therapy a lone. Improvements were noted a s early as week 1. Increase s in exercise capacity were accompanied by statistically significant improvement in dy spnea and fatigue, as measur ed by the Chronic Heart Failure Questionnaire and the D yspnea Fatigue Index, respectively. The efficacy of chronically-inf used Flolan in PAH and scleroderma spectrum of diseases (NYHA Class II to IV) was evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 12-week trial (n = 111) comparing Flolan plus c onventional therapy with conventional therapy alone. The m ean Flolan dose was 11.2 ng/kg /min at the end of week 12. Sta tistically significant improvement was observed in the 6MWD in patients receiving cont inuous Flolan plus conv entional therapy for 12 weeks compared to those receiving conventional therapy alone. I ncreases in exercise capac ity were accompanied by statistically significant impro vement in dyspnea and fatigue, a s measured by Borg Dyspnea Index and Dyspnea Fatigue Index. At week 12, the NYHA FC improved in 41% of patie nts treated with Flolan plus conventional therapy compared to none of the patients treated with conventional ther apy alone. However, the majo rity of patients in both treatment groups showed no chang e in FC, with 4% of the Flolan plus conventional therapy group and 27% of conventional therapy group alone worsening. 247 Data as of November 6, 2018 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 7 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Letairis (ambrisentan) The safety and efficacy of Letairis in the treatment of PAH wer e established in the ARIES trials. ARIES-1 and ARIES- 2 tr ials that compared Letairis to placebo in 394 patients. Compared to placebo, treatment with Letairis resulted in a sign ificant increase in exercise capacity as measured by 6MWD ( Gali\u00e8 et al 2008[a] ). ARIES-E extension study for ARIES-1 and A RIES-2. After 1 year of treatment, there was an improvem ent in 6MWD in the 2.5, 5 and 1 0 mg Letairis grou ps (25, 28 and 37 m, respectively). After 2 years of treatment, the improvement was sustained in the 5 and 10 mg groups (23 and 28 m), but not the 2.5 mg group (7 m) (Oudiz et al 2009 ). ARIES-3 was a long-term, open-lab el, single-arm, safety, and ef cacy study of Letairis in patients with PH receiving Letairis 5 mg once daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in 6MWD at week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints in cluded change in plasma NT-proBN P, Borg Dyspnea Index, WHO FC, time to clinical worsening of PAH, survival and adv erse events (AEs). A total of 224 patients with PH due to idiopathic and familial PAH enrol led, and 53% of patients recei ved stable background PAH therapies. After 24 weeks of therapy, there was an increase in 6MWD of 21 m (95% CI, 12 t o 29), and a decrease in NT-proBNP of -26% (95% CI, -34 to -16%) observed in t he overall population compared to baseline. However, increases in 6MWD were not observed in several non-Group 1 PH subpopulations. Peripheral edema, headache, and dyspnea were the most common AEs ( Badesch et al 2012 ). The AMBITION trial (n = 610) wa s a double-blind, randomized, Ph ase 3/4 trial, which compared combination treatment with Letairis plus Adc irca to monotherapy with each in patients with WHO FC II or III symptoms. The study protocol was amended during the trial resulting in 17% of the i nitial protocol patients being excluded from the analysis, and treatment was administered significantly longer in the combination group vs. monotherapy groups (p = 0.03). Results demonstrated that patients receiving combination therap y had significantly fewe r clinical failure events (defined as death, hospitalizati on for worsening PAH, disease p rogression, or unsatisfactory long-term clinical response) compared to patients receiving individual monotherapy (combination vs. pool ed-monotherapy group, hazard ratio [HR] 0.5; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.72; p < 0.001). Primar y event outcomes were primarily driven by hospitalization. No significant d ifferences were observed in te rms of change in FC or all -cause death. The most common AEs that occurred more oft en with combination treatment included peripheral edema, headache, nasal congestion, anemia, and bronchitis ( Gali\u00e8 et al 2015[a] ). Based on results from the AM BITION trial, the FDA-approved Letairis in combination with Adc irca to reduce the risks of dis ease progression and hospital ization for worsening PAH, and to improve exercise ability. Opsumit (macitentan) The efficacy and safety of Opsumi t on progression of PAH were demonstrated in a multicenter , Phase 3, event-driven, placebo-controlled trial (SERAPHIN patients with sympto matic PAH (WHO FC II, III, or IV) with or without concomitant use of oral PDE-5 in hibitors, oral or inhaled PCAs, CCBs, or L-arginine for the 3 month period prior to randomization. Patients were randomized to placebo (n = 250), O psumit 3 mg once daily (n = 250), or Opsumit 10 mg once daily (n = 242). The mean tr eatment durations were 85.3, 9 9.5, and 103.9 weeks in the placebo, Opsumit 3 mg, and Opsumit 10 mg groups, respect ively. The primary study endpoint was time to the first o ccurrence of death, a significant morbidity event (defined as atrial septostomy, lung transplantation, initiation of IV or SC PCAs), or other worsening of PAH (defined as a s ustained 15% decrease from ba seline in 6MWD, worsening of PAH symptoms as determined by worsening of WHO FC, and need for additional trea tment of PAH) during the double-blind treatment plus 7 days. Pre-specified seco ndary endpoints included change from baseline to month 6 in the 6MWD and percentage of patients with improvement in WHO FC. Other critic al pre-specified secondary endpoints were time to PAH death or PAH hospitalization . The primary endpoint occurred in 46.4%, 38%, and 31.4% of the patients in the placebo, Opsumit 3 mg, and Opsumit 10 mg groups, respectively. Opsumit 10 mg once daily therapy resulted in a 45% reduction compar ed to placebo (HR, 0.55; 97.5% CI, p curren ce of the primar y endpoint to the end of the double- blind treatment. The benefici al effect of Opsum it 10 mg w as primarily due to its reduction in clinical worsening ( Pulido et al 2013). o In a sub-group analysis of the e ffect of Opsumit on hospitaliz ations, there were 117 ( 104 and 90 (37.2%) patients in the placeb o, Opsumit 3 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, who were hospitalized for any cause at least once during double-blind treatment, and they experienced a total of 171, 159, and 135 all-cause hospitalizations, respectively. C ompared with that of placebo, the risk of all-cause hospita lization with Opsumit 3 mg was (HR, 0.811; 95% CI, 0.623 to 1.057; p = 0. 1208) and with Opsumit 10 mg by 32.3% (HR, 248 Data as of November 6, 2018 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 8 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Compar ed with place bo, the rate of PAH-relat ed hospitalization was reduced by 44.5% in the Opsumit 3 mg group (p = 0.0004) and by 49.8% in the Opsumit 10 mg group (p < 0.0001). The mean number of annual hospita l days for PAH-related hospita lizations was reduced by 53.3% in the Opsumit 3 mg arm (p = 0.0001) and by 52.3% in the Opsu mit 10 mg arm (p = 0.0003). Due to the exploratory nature of this endpoint and small population, dat a from this study must be interpreted cautiously ( Channick et al 2015 ). Remodulin (treprostinil) The safety and efficacy of Remo 2 identi cal 12-week, multi-center, randomized, placebo- controlled, double-blind trials in a total of 470 patients with NYHA Class II, III, and IV PAH. Remodulin was administered SC at an average dose of 9.3 ng/kg/min. The effect on the 6MWD was small and did not achieve statistical significance at 12 weeks. For the combined populations, the median change from baseline for patients on Remodulin was 10 m and the median change from baseline on placebo was 0 m from a baseline of approximately 345 m. Remodulin significantly impro ved the Borg dys pnea score duri ng the 6-minute walk test. Remodulin also consistently improved indices of dyspnea, fatigue, and signs an d symptoms of PH. However, these results were difficult to interpret in the co ntext of incomplete blinding to treatment assignment resulting from infusion site symptoms. Orenitram (treprostinil) The efficacy and safety of Orenitram were evaluated in 3 multi- center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in 349 patients (FREEDOM -M), 350 patients (FREEDOM-C), a nd 310 patients (FREEDOM-C2). o FREEDOM-M compared twice daily a dministration of Orenitram with placebo in patients ne wly diagnosed with PAH and not receiving any backgrou nd PAH treatment. The dose titrat ion was based on patient's clinical response and tolerability. The primary endpoin t was change in 6MWD over 12 weeks. The Orenitram group showed a significant improvement in 6MWD of 23 m (p = 0.0125). More than 50% of pati ents had an improvement of 20 m, and over 30% of patients had an im provement of > 50 m ( Jing et al 2013 ). Orenitram demonstrated AEs typical of prostacyclin treatments ( Waxman 2013 ). o FREEDOM-C and FREEDOM-C2 faile d to meet the primary endpoint o f improved 6MWD ( Tapson et al 2012, Tapson et al 2013 ). Revatio (sildenafil) The safety and efficacy of Revat io were evaluated in the SUPER- 1 study, a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled trial cons istin g of 278 patients with predominantly WHO FC II or III symptoms. Compared to placebo, Revatio significantly imp roved exercise capacity, as m easured by 6MWD , WHO FC symptoms and Gali\u00e8 ). 46% baseline, 19% had died and 17% discontinued treatment or were lost to follow-up ( Rubin et al 2011 ). The addition of Revatio to epoprostenol was evaluated in PAC ES, a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial consisting o f 267 patients receiving epoprostenol with predominantly WHO FC II or III sympt oms. Revatio added to epopr ostenol improved exercise capacity, hemodynamic measurements and time to clinical worsening more than epoproste nol plus placebo ( Simonneau et al 2008 ). Tracleer (bosentan) Tracleer was originally FDA-appro ved in PAH patients with WHO F C III and IV symptoms based on the results from 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled trials in 32 (Stud y 351) and 213 (BREATHE-1 ) patients treated for 16 and 12 weeks, respectively. In bot h studies, significant increa ses in the 6MWD were observ ed in all Tracleer groups compared to placebo. Tracleer was also associated with a signif icant reduction in dyspn ea during walk tests and a significant improvement in WHO FC symptoms ( Channick et al 2001, Rubin et al 2002 ). The FDA-approved indication was subsequently expanded to include patients with WHO FC II sy mptoms based on the resu lts of the EARLY study consisting of 168 patients. In th is 26-week stu dy, treatment with Tracleer resulted in an in crease in the 6MWD of 11.2 m compared to a decrease of 7.9 m in the placebo group; however , the difference was not statistically significant. The study did show a significant delay in clinical worsening and a lower incidence of worsening FC symptoms in the Tracleer group compared to placebo ( Gali\u00e8 et al 2008[b], McLaughlin et al 2006 ). o The results of an open-label extension phase of the EARLY tria l suggested that the majority of patients exposed to long-term Tracleer therapy maint ained or improved their FC. Approximately 20% of patient s discontinued treatment because of AEs, which were most c ommonly PAH worsening (defined as death or initiation of IV or SC PCAs) and 249 Data as of November 6, 2018 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 9 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Due to l ack of a control group, data fr om this study must be interpreted cautiously (Simmoneau et al 2014 ). The COMPASS-2 trial (n = 334) was a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial consisting of symptomatic PAH patients rangi ng from WHO FC II to IV who were taking stable Revatio do ses (mean dose, 60 mg) for 3 months. Patients were randomized to Tracleer 125 mg twi ce daily plus Revatio or placebo plus Revatio for 16 weeks. There was no differenc e in the primary endpoint, time to the first morbidity/mortalit y event (defined as time to all-cause death, hospitalization for worsening PAH, initiation of IV prostanoid, atrial s eptostomy, lung transplant, or worsening PAH). There were also no significant differences in t he individual measures o f the primary endpoint; however, observed benef its were seen in term s of the mean 6MWD test. A high drop-out rat e was observed during the trial; therefore, st udy power was reduced ( McLaughlin et al 2015 ). Tyvaso (treprostinil) The safety and efficacy of Tyvaso were evaluated in TRIUMPH I, a 12-week, multi-center, randomized, placebo- controlled, double-blind trial in WHO Group I PAH (98% NYHA Cla ss III) patients who were receiving either Tracleer or Revatio (n = 235) for at least 3 months prior to study initiation. Patients received either placebo or Tyvaso in 4 daily treatments with a target dose of 9 breaths (54 mcg) per session . The primary endpoint, 6MWD, was measured at peak exposure (10 to 60 minutes post dose) and 3 to 5 hours aft er Tracleer or 30 to 120 minutes after Revatio. Patients receiving Tyvaso had a placebo-corrected median change from baseline in peak 6MWD of 20 meters (m) at week 12 (p < 0.001). The 6MWD measured at trough exposure (meas ured 4 hours after dosi ng) improved by 14 m. In a long-term follow-up of patients who were treated with Tyvaso in the pivotal study and the open-label extension (n = 206), Kaplan-Meier estimates o f survival at 1, 2, and 3 years were 97%, 91%, and 82%, respectively. Of note, these observations were uncontrolled and therefore cannot be compared to the control group to determine the long-term effect of Tyvaso on mortality. Uptravi (selexipag) The safety and efficacy of Uptravi were evaluated in the GRIPHO N study (n = 1,156), a randomized, double-blind, consisti ng predominan tly idiopathic PAH, and WHO FC II or III symptoms. The median duration of treatment vari ed from 1.2 to 1.4 years for placebo and Uptravi, respe ctively, and treatment end was defined as 7 days after the last day of treatment intake. C ompared to placebo, Uptravi s ignificantly reduced the composite endpoint signifying the time to progression of PAH, defined as all-cause death o r a PAH complication (27% vs. 41.6%; HR, 0.6; 99% CI, 0.46 to 0.78; p < 0.001); however, there were no differences in mortality betwee n gro up s. The reduction in PAH complications was primarily driven by a re duction in disease progression (17.2% vs. 6.6%) and PAH-related hospitalizat ion (18.7% vs. 13.6%). The safety of Up travi compared to other age nts in class is not clear. The GRIPHON pre-specified sub-gr oup analysis did not stratify AEs by background treatmen t, but the study allowed stable doses of PDE-5 inhibitors and/or an ERA which accounted for ~80% of patients wi thin the placebo baseline group. Those AEs that occurred si gnificantly more often with Up travi treatment included headache, diarrhea, jaw pain, nausea, myalgia, vomiting, extre mity pain, flushing (p < 0.001 for all AEs), anemia (p = 0.05 ), and hyperthyroidism (p = 0.004) ( Sitbon et al 2015). Frost and colleagues demonstrated that transitioning patients from inhaled treprostinil to Uptravi was effective and safe ( Frost et al 2018 ). Of 34 enrolled patients, 32 (9 4.1%) stopped inhaled treprost inil and were receiving Uptravi, with 28 patients (82.4%) meeting all criteria for sustained tre atment transition. In general, patients remained clinically stable throughout therapy and re ported improved outcomes. Veletri (epoprostenol) Please refer to the clinical effi cacy summary for Flolan above. Ventavis (iloprost) The randomized , placebo-controlled trial consisting of 203 patients with NYHA Class III PAH (majority), Class IV PAH, or CTEPH. Patients received 2.5 or 5 mcg of Ventavis 6 to 9 times daily during waking hours. The dif ference in the primary composite endpoint (10% increase in 6MWD 30 minutes afte r dose, improvement by at least one NYHA class compared to baseline, and no death or deterioration of PH) was statistically significant (19 % vs. 4% placebo, p = 0.0033) . The results for the CTEPH patients were not included in t he aforementioned results, since there was inadequate evi dence of benefit in this 250 Data as of November 6, 2018 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 10 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The placebo- corrected difference in the 6MW D in Ventavis patients at 12 weeks was 40 m (p < 0.01). The safety of Ventavis was eva luated in a prospective, 2 year, open-label study with 63 PAH patients. Patients received Ventavis 2 to 4 mcg 6 to 9 times daily. Thirty-six pat ients completed at least 630 days of therapy, 19 patients dropped out prematurely, and 8 pat ients died. AEs were mild to moderate, the most commo n of which were cough and flushing. Two-year survival was found to be 87% [95% CI, 76 % to 98%] ( Olschewski et al 2010 ). Meta-analyses and systematic reviews The results of a meta-analysis o f 18 randomized controlled tria ls (n = 4,363) suggested t hat all oral PAH therapies confer a therapeutic benefit. Mor e specifically, the findings s howed: o PDE-5 inhibitors were associated with a statically significant reduction in mortality (rela tive risk [RR], 0.22; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.71; p = 0.011), while other drugs only showed a trend toward reducing mortality. o Compared with placebo, ERAs, PDE-5 inhibitors, and riociguat s ignificantly reduced clinical worsening, ameliorated WHO function class, and increased 6MWD. Oral prostanoids only showed a m ild effect on 6MWD (19.88 m; 95 % CI, 10.12 to 29.64, p = 0), and did not have any effect on redu cing mortality and clinical w orsening. Additionally, oral prostanoids significantly incre ased the incidence of treatment discontinuation due to AEs ( RR, 3.41; 95% CI, 2.06 to 5.63; p = 0) ( Zheng et al 2014[a] ). A meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials (n = 2,244) that evaluated the improvemen t in overall survival with use of oral, SC, IV, and inhaled PCAs, suggested the following: o Only IV PCAs showed a survival benefit (RR , 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.79; p = 0.011), while oral (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.66; p = 0.446), inhaled (RR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.05 to 1.67; istration 2.20; p = 0.837 ) did not show a benefit. o Overall mortality in the 14 st udies was 3.30% (74 of 2,244 pat ients) with 2.52% (30 of 1,189 patients) mortality in the PCA-treated group and 4.17% (44 of 1,055 patients) mortalit y in the placebo group. The cumulative RR estimate of death showed a signifi cant reduction of 44% (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0. 88; p = 0.01), and no heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0%; p = 0.84) was detected among studies ( Zheng et al 2014[b] ). The results of a meta-analysis o f 21 randomized controlled tria ls (n = 5,105) suggested tha t there was a reduction in the number of combined clinical worsening events (defined as al l-cause mortality, lung or heart-lung transplant, hospitalization for PAH, and escal ation of treatment) in patien ts with PAH with oral treat ments, but showed less favorable effects on life expectancy in the short-term follow-u p. Results demonstrated: o All classes reduced clinical wor sening compared to placebo, in cluding oral prosta 0.098 to = 0.015). o There were no significant reduct ions in mortality with any cla ss versus placebo ( Zhang et al 2015 ). A meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (n = 962) of < 16 weeks duration in adults and children treated with an sGC stimulator determined t he following (all comparisons are vs. placebo): o sGC stimulators improve PAP in patients wi th PAH (who are trea tment na\u00efve or receiving a prostanoid or ERA) or those with recurrent or inoperable CTEPH. o Pooled analysis showed a mean di fference in 6MWD of 30.13 m (9 5% CI, 5.29 to 54.96; I2 = 64%). On subgroup analysis, for PAH, there was no effect on 6MWD (11.91 CTEPH, sGC stimulators improved 6MWD by a mean difference of 45 m (95% CI, 23.87 to 66.13; I2 = 0%). o The secondary outcome of morta lity showed no change on pooled analysis. o Although pooled results demonstrat ed an increase (improvement) in WHO FC (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.87 to 2.72; I2 = 49%), the results did not reach s tatistical significance. Also, there was no effect on clin ical worsening (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.17 to 1.14; I2 = 54%) or reduction in MAP 95% CI, 4.96 to 0. 58; I2 = 49%). The pooled analysis did not show any signifi cant difference in serious AEs (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.90; I2 = 39%). o sGC stimulators should not be taken by people also receiving PDE-5 inhibitors or nitrates due to the risks of hypotension, and there is currently no evi dence supporting thei r use in pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease (Wardle et al 2016 ). Several additional meta-analyses have been conducted evaluating ERAs, PDE-5 inhibitors, and PCAs. Notable observations in meta-analyses include the following: o Survival benefit was seen more w ith IV PCAs, especially in pat ients with more severe disease, compared with other routes such as oral and inhalation ( Ryerson et al 2010 ). 251 Data as of November 6, 2018 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 11 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. o ERAs (Letairis and Tr acleer) may have a somewhat lower effect on exercise tolerance in patients with connective tissue diseases, whereas PDE-5 inhibitors (Revatio and Adcirca) and the PCA epoprostenol showed consistent effects regardless of the presen ce or absence of connective tis sue diseases ( Kuwana et al 2013 ). o Combination therapy appears to i mprove exercise capacity and r educe the risk of clinical w orsening in PAH patients compared with monotherapy ( Zhu et al 2012 ). o Favorable effects on clinical ev ents were not predicted by cha nges in the 6MWD ( Savarese et al 2012 ). In addition, pulmonary hemodynamics correlated with exercise capacity, but not with clinical events ( Savarese et al 2013 ). o According to an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality met a-analysis, prostacyclin analogues showed a statistically significant impro vement in mortality. In addition , all drug classes improved 6MWD, but comparisons between agents were inconclusive . Combination therapy also impr oved 6MWD compared wi th monotherapy, but comparisons ens were inconclusive. Patien ts taking ERAs and PDE-5 inhibitors had a lower risk of hospitalization than t hose taking placebo, while the re duction in patients taking PCAs compared with placebo was similar, but not sta tistically significant ( McCrory et al 2013 ). o A meta-analysis including 15 RCTs comparing combination and monotherapy for the treatment of PAH found that the absolute risk reduction of c linical worsening was relatively constant beyond a 6 to 12- month treatment duration, and cast doubt on the need for tr ials of longer duration for measuring treatment efficacy in this population ( Lajoie et al 2017 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Several published clinical guidelines on PAH are available. o The Chest Guideline and Expert P anel Report on pharmacologic t herapy for PAH provides several options for initial and subsequent therapy ( Taichman et al 2014 ). Initial therapy: For patient s in WHO FC II or III, monotherapy with an ERA, PDE-5 inhibitor, or sGC stimulator is recommended. In WHO FC III patient s with evidence of rapid prog ression or markers of poor prognosis, a parenteral prostanoid should be considered. For patients in WHO FC IV, a parenteral PCA is recommended; however, if patients are unable or unwilli ng to manage a parenteral product, an alternative is an inhaled PCA combined with an ERA. Subsequent therapy: For patients in WHO FC III who have eviden ce of progression or markers of poor prognosis, addition of an inhaled or parenteral prostanoid should be consi dered. In patients in WHO FC III or IV, if clinical status is unacceptable, a seco nd (and if needed, a third) class of PAH therapy can be added. o The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH ( Gali\u00e8 et al 2015[b] ) provide several options for bo th monotherapy and combination therapy of PAH. Monotherapy: For patients in WHO FC II, reco mmendations includ e an ERA, a an sGC stimulator, or a prostacyclin receptor agonist. For patients in WHO FC III, the same medications may be used, and another option is a PCA. PCAs (eg, epoprostenol) are generally preferred for patients in WHO FC IV. Initial drug combination therapy: Only the combination of Adci rca and Letairis has a category I recommendation for patients in WHO FC II and III; this combination also has a category IIb recommendatio n for patients in WHO FC IV. Other double- and triple-therapy combinations are also options, including other ERA and PDE-5 inhibitor combinations (WHO FC II, III, and IV) and some combinations of oral therapies w ith parenteral PCAs (WHO FC III and IV). Sequential drug combination therap y: Several options are provi ded for sequential combination therapy. Oral combinations are commonly recommended for patients in WHO FC II and III, including Opsumit added to Revatio, Adempas added to Tracleer, and Uptravi added to an ERA and/or a PDE-5 inhibitor. Other oral combinations and combinations of oral therapies with inhaled or parenteral agent s may also be used in patients in WHO FC II, III, and/or IV, but in most cases these recommendations are not as s trong. o A 2018 scientific statement on the evaluation and management o f right-sided heart failure from the American Heart Association (AHA) summarizes dat a for the use of prostacyclin a nalogs, PDE-5 inhibitors, and endothelin receptor agonists in patients with PAH ( Konstam et al 2018 ). However, specific recommendations concerning the use of these agents in the PAH population are not provided in this doc ument. o Reputable society groups agree that evidence supporting pediat ric treatment is lacking. The AHA and American Thoracic Society (ATS) recently published a guideline on pediat ric PH. This guideline states that in pediatric patients with lower-risk PAH, ora l therapy with either a PDE-5 inhibitor or an ERA is rec ommended, and in pediatric 252 Data as of November 6, 2018 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 12 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A recent expert consensus statement from the European Pediatric Pulmonary Vascu lar Disease Network, the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation, and the German Society of Pe diatric Cardiology reaffirm the AHA/ATS guideline. Additionally, early combination therapy with oral PA H drugs in treatment-na\u00efve children who are FC II or III may be considered ( Hansmann et al 2016 ). SAFETY SUMMARY sGC Stimulator o Adempas has a boxed warning due to embryo-fetal toxicity. It i s contraindicated in preg nancy because it may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. o Females can only receive Adempas through the Adempas REMS Prog ram, a restricted dist ribution program that requires enrollment and certific ation of prescribers, patients, and pharmacies. The program also requires females of reproductive potential to comply with pregnancy testing and con traception requirements. o Adempas is contraindicated in pat ients hyperten Adempas include nitrates or ni tric oxide donors and PDE- inhibitors (specific and non-specific). o Warnings and precautions for A dempas include symptomatic hypot ension, bleeding, and pulmonary edema in patients with veno-occlusive di sease (if confirmed, treatment s hould be discontinued). o The most common AEs associated with Adempas include headache, dyspepsia and gastritis , dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, Opsumit, and Tracleer) have boxed warnings for embryo-fetal toxicity and/or risks of teratogenicity due to the potential for fetal harm when adminis tered to women who are or may become pregnant. o The Letairis and Opsumit REMS programs, respectively, are desi gned in the same manner as the Adempas REMS program described above. o The Tracleer Access Program (T. A.P.) program has been re-listed as the Tracleer REMS program. As a requirement of the REMS, healthcare professionals who prescribe or dispense Tracleer must enroll and comply with the requirements. Requirements include monthly reviews of pregn ancy tests in women of reproductive potential, and liver enzymes and bilirubin in all patients. All patients m ust understand the risks a nd complete an enrollment form. o Letairis has an additional raindication for idiopathic pul monary fibrosis (IPF). o Tracleer has an additional box ed warning for risks of hepatotoxicity and birth defects. Throughout treatment and for 1 month after stopping Tracleer , females of reproductive potent ial must use 2 reliable methods of contraception unless the patient has had a tubal sterilization or had an intr auterine device (I UD) inserted. o Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systematic Symptoms (DRESS ), anaphylaxis, rash, and angioedema have been reported with Tracleer. o Warnings and precautions for Adci rca and Revatio include prolo nged erection (for more than 4 hours), hearing loss, and visio n loss (in 1 or both ey es), all of which require immed iate medical attention. o Pulmonary edema/fluid retention has been reported during postm arketing surveillance of Let airis and Tracleer. Fluid retention may occur within wee ks after starting Letairis and is more common when Letairis is used in combination with Adcirca than with Letairis or Adcirca alone. o Use of Opsumit and Tracleer shoul d be avoided in patients taki ng potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A. o Decreases in sperm count, decre ased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and pulmonary edema (associated with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) have been observed in p atients taking ERAs. PDE-5 Inhibitors o All PDE-5 inhibitor products hav e a contraindication for use i n patients on nitrates as well as a warning with concomitant alpha blocker use du e to resulting hypotension. The patient should allow 48 hours to elapse between the last dose of Adcirca and taking nitrates. Additionally, Rev atio and Adcirca are contraindicated for concomitant use with the sGC stimulator, Adempas. o In August 2012, the prescribing information for Revatio was updated with a warning stati ng that the use of Revatio in pediatric patients is not recommended due to increased morta lity associated with higher doses and noted that lower doses are not effective in improving exercise capacity. T he FDA clarified the warning related to pediatric use 253 Data as of November 6, 2018 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 13 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The FDA acknowledged there may be situat ions in which the benefit-to-risk profile may be acceptab le in individual children, for example, when other treatmen t options are limited, in which case Revatio can be used with close monitoring (FDA Drug Safety Communication, 2014). o Co-administration of Revatio o r Adcirca with potent CYP3A inhi recommended. Co-administration of Adcirca with potent CYP3A inducers is not recommended. o Blood pressure lowering effect s are increased when Adcirca is taken with alcohol. o Revatio and Adcirca are genera lly well tolerated with headache s, myalgia, flushing, and dy spepsia being the most common AEs reported for both products. o Stevens-Johnson syndrome and ex foliative dermatitis have been reported with Adcirca, and anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock and anaphylact oid reaction have been reporte d with Revatio. o Vision loss, including permanent vision loss because of non-ar teritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy has been reported with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Prostacyclin Receptor Agonist o Uptravi has a warning/precauti on to consider PVOD if acute pul monary edema develops. o Uptravi is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and has not been studied in dialysis patients (o r with eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m2). o Concomitant administration of U ptravi is contraindicated with strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (eg, gemfibrozil). o The most common AEs reported wi th Uptravi are headache, diarrh ea, jaw pain, nausea, myalgia, vomiting, pain in extremity, and flushing. These AEs are more frequent during the dose titration phase. PCAs o Orenitram is contraindicated fo r use in patient s with severe h epatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). o Flolan and Veletri are contraindicated in patients with heart failure due to severe left v entricular dysfunction. Additionally, Veletri is contrai ndicated in patients with pulmo nary edema, stating that the development of pulmonary edema during dose initiation may be associated with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. o Orenitram and Tyvaso both carry a warning/precaution related t o an increased risk of bleeding, particularly in patients receiving anticoagul ants. Additional warnings and precautions for Tyvaso include symptomatic hypotension, possible Tyvaso dos e changes when inhibitors or in ducers of CYP2C8 are added or withdrawn, and a possible increase in exposure or a decrease in to lerability with hepatic or renal impairm ent. Orenitram should be avoided in patients with blind-e nd pouches (diverticulosis). o The safety of Tyvaso and Ventav is has not been established in patients with significant un derlying lung disease (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmo nary disease, acute pulmonary infections). Patients with acute pulmonary infections who are taking Tyvaso should be carefully monitored to detect any worsening of lung disease and loss of drug effect. Ventavis can induce bronchospasm. o Hypotension leading to syncope has been observed with Ventavis . It should not be administere d in patients with a systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg. o Flolan and Ventavis carry additional warnings and precautions regarding pulmonary edema . If signs of pulmonary edema occur, treatment should be stopped because this could be a sign of pulmonary venous hypertension or pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. o With Flolan, Orenitram, Remodul in, and Veletri, abrupt withdra wal (including interrupt ions in drug delivery) or sudden large reductions in the dos e can worsen PAH symptoms (or cause rebound PH in patients taking Flolan). o Flolan carries additional warnings and precautions that includ e vasodilation reactions and an increased risk of bleeding. o Flolan, Remodulin, and Veletri ar e administered via an indwell ing central venous cat heter. This route of administration is associated with blood stream infections (BSI) and sepsis, which may be fatal. During long-term follow-up, sepsis was reported a t a rate of 0.3 infections per patient per year in patients treate d with Flolan. In an open-label study of IV Remodulin using an external infusion pum p (n = 47), there were 7 catheter-related line infections during approximately 35 patient years, or about one BSI event per 5 years of use . A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey of 7 sites that used IV Remodulin for the treatment of PAH found approximately one BSI event per 3 years of use. In an open-label study of an impl antable pump (n = 60), there were 2 BSIs related to the implant procedure during approximately 265 patient-years. C ontinuous SC infusion (undiluted) is the preferred mode of administration of Remodulin. VELTERI was associated with chills/fever/sepsis/flu- like symptoms in 25% of patients in controlled trials for idiopathic or heritable PAH. 254 Data as of November 6, 2018 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 14 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CONCLUSION Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening dis order that is associated with a poor prognosis. There are 5 classes of drugs t hat are used in the management of PAH, including endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitors, a prostacyclin an agonist, and a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator. All of the PAH agents have shown improved pulmonary hemodynamic s and exercise capacity in PAH patients as compared to placebo. Their effects on mortality have not been a dequately demonstrated. Most trials for PAH have been relatively short-term trials (12 to 18 weeks) that evaluated ch anges in exercise capacity using the 6-minute walk distanc e (6MWD) as a primary endpoint. However, recently there has been a preference toward longer, event-driven tria ls that evaluate composite clin ical worsening events ( LeVarge et al 2015 ). GRIPHON, AMBITION, and COMPASS-2 ( Gali\u00e8 et al 2015[a], McLaughlin et al 2015, Pulido et al 2013, Sitbon et al 2015 ). Clinical trials have demonstrat ed the safety and efficacy of th e individual PAH agents; how ever, there is limited data comparing the agents within class es or between classes. Data ar e conflicting regarding the benefits of combination vs. monotherapy ( Barst, 2009, McLaughlin et al 2009, Gali\u00e8 et al 2015[b], Taichman et al 2014 ). Two recent trials evaluating this include the AMBI TION and COMPASS-2 trials. The AMBITION trial has demonstrated that combination treatment with Letairis and Adcirca resulted in red uced disease progression and hospitalization in mainly FC II and III PAH patients co mpared to monotherapy ( Gali\u00e8 et al 2015[a] ). However, COMPASS-2 no difference between Tracleer plus Revatio versus Revatio monotherapy for most endpoints with the exception of the mean 6MWD test ( McLaughlin et al 2015 ). Adempas is the first and only dr ug to be FDA-approved in the tr eatment of CTEPH. Pulmonary endarterectomy can be curative for CTEPH, but it is technically demanding which ma y limit access to its use as a treatment. Adempas is dosed 3 times daily, which is more frequent than several other oral treatments for PAH. The ERAs (Letairis, Opsumit, and Tracleer) competitively bind t o both receptors with differ ent affinities. Letairis and Opsumit are highly selective for the ET A receptor, while Tra cleer is slightly selective for the ET A receptor over the ET B receptor. In addition, Opsumit has a pharmacologically active m etabolite and is considered \"tissue-targeting\" because it displays high affinity and sustained occupan cy at the ET rec eptors in human pulmonary a rterial smooth muscles. However, the clinical significa nce of receptor affinities of th e ERAs has not been established. The PDE-5 inhibitors (Adcirca and Revatio) are generally well t olerated; the most common side effects include headache, myalgia, flushing, dizzi ness, and gastrointestinal up set. Both products are cont raindicated for use in patients on nitrates and have w arnings about thei r use in patie nts on alpha-adrenergic inhi bitors. Use of Adcirca with potent CYP3A inhibitors or inducer s may significantly alter ser um levels of Adcirca and is not recommended. Use of Adcirca in patients who are usi ng an sGC stimulator may potenti ate the hypotensive effects of sGC stimulators and is not recommended. Use of Revatio with potent CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended as they may significantly alter serum levels of Revatio. In addition to the oral formulati on, Revatio is available in an oral suspension formulation and an intravenous formulation. Currently, Revatio tablets and intravenous formula tion are available generically. Adcirca is taken just once a day compared to 3 times a day with Revatio. Orenitram is the first oral PCA approved by the FDA. The PCAs a re frequently reserved for more severe forms of PAH. As the first oral option in this subclass for treatment of PAH, Orenitram may offer a more convenient alternative dosage form leading to earlier PCA initiation in treatment. Ore nitram is dosed twice daily and requires dosage titration every 3 to 4 days. Orenitram d id not demonstrate added benefit when added to other v asodilator therapy. Uptravi is a first-in-class prostacyclin receptor agonist, whic h works within the same pat hway as Orenitram. Based on results from the GRIPHON trial, U ptravi has reduced disease pro gression and hospitalization. This is in contrast to Orenitram, which has only improv ed exercise tole rability. Unlik e Orenitram, Uptravi has demonstrated efficacy when combined with a PDE-5 inhi bitor and/or an ERA. The safety of Uptravi compared to ot her oral agents in the class is not clear. The GRIPHON pre-specified sub-group analysi s did not stratify AEs by background treatment, but the study allowed stable doses of PDE-5 inhibitors and/or an ER A throughout the trial. Background treatment was used by ~80% of patients within the placebo baseline group. Tho se AEs reported significantly more often with Uptravi treatment include headache, diarrhea, jaw pain, nausea, myalgia , vomiting, extremity pain, flushing, anemia, and hyperthyroidi sm (Sitbon et al 2015 ). Bas ed on indirec t trial evidence, the proportion of patients discontinuing Uptravi vs. placebo (14% vs. 7%) due to AEs in the GRIPHON trial was hi gher than those within the Orenitram labeling vs. 258 Data as of November 6, 2018 MG-U/SS-U/AKS Page 18 of 20 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Overall, it is not clear how the Uptravi safety profile compare s to other agents in class due to different study populations . Head-to-head trials are needed to confirm safety risks and differences. The 2014 CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report update identif ies PDE-5 inhibitors, ERA s, the oral PCA, and the sGC stimulator as viable alter natives in treating PAH adults wi th varying severity levels (F C II to IV) based primarily on consensus opinions ( Taichman et al 2014 ). The 2015 European Society of Car diology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) guidelines stratifies PAH treatment by low or intermediat e risk or high risk patients. In adult patients with low or in termediate ris k (FC II to III), initial monotherapy or initial or al combination therapy is reco mmended. Based on the AMBITI ON trial, guidelines state that initial combination treatment with ambrisentan plus tadalafil has proven to be superior to initial monotherapy with ambrisentan or tadalafil in delaying clinical failure. In adult patients with high risk (FC IV ), initial combination therapy including IV PCAs are recommended with epoprostenol IV consider ed first-line due to the mo rtality benefits in trials (Gali\u00e8 et al 2015[b] ). Reputable society group guidelines agree that there is a lack o f randomized trials in pediatric patients, making it difficult to deliver strong guidelines ( Abman et al 2015, Gali\u00e8 et al 2015[b], Hansmann et al 2016 ). The 2015 American Heart Association and American Th oracic Society guidelines recommend oral therapy with either a PDE-5 inhibitor or an ERA in lower risk PAH pedi atric patients. In pediatric patients with higher-risk PAH , IV and SC PCAs should be initiated immediately with a goal to transition patients to oral or inhaled therapy after the patient is asymptomatic and stable ( Abman et al 2015 ). The 2015 ESC/ERS guidelines recommend that pediatric treatme nt follows adult guidelines taking in account risks ( Gali\u00e8 et al 2015[b] ). The European Pediatric Pulmona ry Vascular Disease Network, the International Society of Hear t and Lung Transplantation, an d the German Society of Pedi atric Cardiology reaffirm much of the aforementioned guidanc e, but also stipulate that ea rly combination therapy with two oral PAH drugs in treatment-na\u00efve children who are FC II or III may be considered (Hansmann et al 2016 ). A 2018 scientific statement on the evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure from the American Heart Association (AHA) summarizes dat a for the use of prostacyclin a nalogs, PDE-5 inhibitors, and endothelin receptor agonists in patients with PAH ( Konstam et al 2018 ). However, specific recommendations c oncerning the use of thes e agents in the PAH population are not provided in this document. REFERENCES Abman SH, Hansmann G, Archer SL, et al.

Therapeutic Class Overview Anti-inflammatory Agents - Misc., Topical INTRODUCTION Atopic dermatitis, also referred to as atopic eczema, is a chro nic, highly pruritic, and relapsing inflammatory skin condition. The prevalence of at opic dermatitis is estimated to be between 15% to 30% in children and 2% to 10% in adults; approximately 18 million children and adults have atopi c dermatitis in the United States (Berke et al 2012, Eichenfield et al 2014a, Food and Drug Administration [FDA] presentation 2015) . Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders in childr en with more than 90% of cases s tarting before the age of 5 years (Eichenfield et al 2014a) . The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis can be explained by impai red epidermal barrier function due to structural and functional abnormalities in the skin as well as a cutaneous inf lammatory response to environmental factors (Weston & Howe 2018) . Pruritus is one of the most c ommon symptoms of atopic dermati tis, and it is an ess ential feature which provokes a vicious \"itch-scratch\" cycle that compromises the epidermal barrier which results in water loss, xerosis, microbial colonization, and secondary infection (Castro 2008). The clinical manifestations of atopic dermatitis vary according to age and disease activity; however, almost all patients with atopic dermatitis r eport dry skin. The infantile and childhood stages are characterized by pruritic, red, cruste d lesions and generally involve the face, neck, and extensor skin surfaces (Eichenfield et al 2014a) . The adult stage of atopic dermatitis is more lichenified and localized to the flexural folds of the extremities (Eichenfield et al 2014a) . Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis i s based on a constellation of clinical symptoms. There is no optimal long-term maintenance treatment for atopic dermatitis, and there is no known cure. The general approach for the treatment of atopic dermatitis involves elimi nation of exacerbating factors, restoring the skin's abnormal barrier function, hydrating the skin, and controlling active disease with topical anti-inflamma tory agents (Eichenfield et al 2014b, Schneider et al 2013, Tollefson et al 2014) . Patients with atopic dermatitis s hould avoid exacerbating facto rs including excessive bathing, low humidity environments, emotional stress, x erosis, and exposure to detergents. Thick creams with low water content or ointments which have zero water content p rotect against xerosis and should be utilized. Antihistamines are utilized as an adjunct in patients with atopic dermatitis to control pruritus and eye irritation. Sedating hydroxyzine) fexofenadine, loratadine) (Eichenfield et al 2014b) . However, evidence supporting their use is weak due to lack of controlled trials. Topical corticosteroids are cons idered to be the standard of ca re for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (Eichenfield et al 2014b, Schneider et al 2013, Tollefson et al 2014) . Low- to high-potency topical corticosteroids are utilized 1 o r more times daily for the treatment of acute flares, as well as inter mittently to prevent relapses . One large trial showed that twice-daily application of topical corticosteroids was no more effective than once- daily application (Krakowski et al 2008) . There are tolerability and safety concerns rega rding the use of including skin atrophy, striae, and telangiectasia, whi ch may limit long-term use of th ese agents. These adverse reactions occur more frequently when topical corticosteroids are used on sensitive a reas of thin skin including skin folds and the face or neck (Eichenfield et al 2014b, Krakowski et al 2008, Schneider et al 2013) . agents for Protopic mechanism of action in atopic de rmatitis is not known. calcine urin, a high affinity to immunophilin-12 ( FKBP-12), which is theorized to be the primary mode of inflammation reduction in atopic dermatitis (Clinical Pharmacology There are some c oncerns regardi ng the long-term safety of these agents. On January 19, 2 006, the FDA approved updated labeling for the agents (FDA press release 2006) . This updated labeling was a re sult of cancer-related adverse events (AEs) with the use of these medications. The labeling includes a boxed warning abou t a possible risk of cancer and a medication guide for patient s to ensure that they are awa re of this concern. The labeling clarifies that these medications are recommended for us e as second-line treatments and are not recommended in children under 2 years of 262 Data as of March 4, 2019 LS/KMR Page 2 of 7 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A definitive causal link bet ween the topical immunosuppres sants and the incidence o f malignancy has not been established. Eucrisa (crisaborole) is a non-steroidal, topical treatment for atopic dermatitis that works by way of phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 inhibition. Inflammation is associated activity and ov eractive PDE-4 has been shown to contribute to the signs and symptoms of atopic dermati tis (Zane et al 2016) . Eucrisa enhances cellular control of inflammation by inhibiting PDE-4 and its ability to degrade intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), thereby suppressing the release of cytokines (Paller et al 2016) . The novel boron chemistry of Eucrisa additionally enables synthesis of a low molecular weight compound that facilitates effective penetration through human skin (Paller et al 2016) .

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Elidel and Protopic The FDA approval of Elidel cream was based on 3 randomized, dou ble-blind, vehicle-controlled, Phase III studies in patients 3 months to 17 years o f age with mild to moderate atop ic dermatitis (N = 589). Two of these 3 trials support the use of Elidel cream in patients 2 years of age and older with mild to moderate atopic dermat itis.

These studies showed significant clinic al response based on physician's global evaluation for Eli del-treated patients compared to patients in the v ehicle group. These studies are outlined in the manufacturer product labeling. The FDA approval of Protopic ointment was based on 3 randomized , double-blind, vehicle-cont rolled, Phase III studies in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. One of t he studies was conducted in pediatric patients (N = 351) ages 2 to 15 years, and the other 2 studies were conducted in a dult patients (N = 632). The primary efficacy endpoint was met by all 3 studies with a significantly greater percentag e of patients achieving at least 90% improvement based on the physician's global evaluati on of clinical response in th e Protopic group compared to the vehicle group (p < 0.001). There was some evidence that Pro topic 0.1% ointment may provide more efficacy than the 0.03% ointment in adult patients who had severe disease at baseline. There was no difference in efficacy between t he Protopic strengths in the pediatric study. These studies are outlined in the manufacturer product labeling. Elidel and Protopic have been dire ctly compared in clinical trials. One trial compared Elidel 1% to Protopic 0.03% in patients 2 to 17 year s of age (N = 141) and found no difference in the incidence of applicatio n site reactions between the topical immunomodulator s in the 6-week study (Kempers et al 2004) . However, itching was repor ted at a significantly higher rate in the Pr otopic group. In 2 other clinical trials, Protopic 0.1% was compared to E lidel in adult patients over 6 weeks. Patients treated with Pr otopic had a significantly greater improvement in the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) score compared to those treated with Elidel ( Abramovits et al 2008, Fleischer et al 2007 ). The success in therapy based on the Investigator Global Atopi c Dermatitis Assessment, improv ement in percent body surface area (BSA) affected, and improvement in signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis in face and neck were all statistically significant for the Protopic group in both studies (Abramovits et al 2008, Fleischer et al 2007) . There were no differences in AEs between the groups. A meta-analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials showed that bot h adults and children in the Pr otopic-treated group had a significantly greater improvem ent in EASI score at week 6 as co mpared to the Elidel group (Paller et al 2005) . The most common AEs in all studies were local application site reactions including burning and stinging (Paller et al 2005) . A meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials (N = 6897) showed that Protopic 0.1% w as equally efficacious as potent topical corticosteroids and more efficacious than mild t opical corticosteroids for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (Ashcroft et al 2005) . Additionally, Elidel was found to be less effective than pote nt topical cort icosteroids (Ashcroft et al 2005) . Individual clinical trials have reported conflicting results (Bieber et al 2007, Doss et al 2009, Doss et al 2010) . A meta-analysis and systematic r eview assessed the effectivenes s of topical immunomodulators compared to topical corticosteroids and/or placebo (N = 7378) (El-Batawy et al 2009) . In terms of overall comparis on, Elidel was found to be more effective than vehicle at 3 and 6 weeks. However, a long-term study that was included in this review did not find any difference between these 2 groups at 6 and 12 months. Also, betamethasone valerate, a potent topical corticosteroid, was found to be significantly more effective in adults (3 weeks) than Elidel i n the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Although this meta-analysis showed th at Elidel seems to be less effective than topical corticosteroids, Elidel would be efficacious in areas where top ical corticosteroids may not be recommended such as the face and sensitive areas includi ng skin folds. Pooled analysis of Protopic trials demonstra ted that Protopic was more effective than vehicle (El-Batawy et al 2009) . When compared to mild potency topical corticosteroids like hy drocortisone acetate, Protopic was more to moderate potency topical corticosteroids, Protopic 0.03% was significantly less effective than topical corticoster oids, and Protopic 0.1% was equal in effectiveness to the topical corticosteroids. Overall, Protopic was found to be more effective than mild topical corticosteroids and equally effective as moderately potent topical corticosteroids (El-Batawy et al 2009) . A systematic review of 20 randomized controlled trials (N = 628 8) showed that Protopic was more efficacious than placebo or mild topical corticos teroids for the treatment of at opic dermatitis (Chen et al 2010) . Additionally, Elidel was more efficacious than placebo an d equally efficacious as mild topical corticosteroids fo r the treatment of atopic dermatitis. In this review, 3 tria ls comparing Elidel to Protop ic were identified. While 2 of the trials did find Protopic to be significantly more efficacious, no significant difference was f ound in the third trial. A retrospective cohort evaluated initial cancer d iagnosis in pa tients with a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis or eczema and found that while exposure to Eli del or Protopic was not associa ted with an increase in overal l cancer rates, exposure to these agents was asso ciated with an increased risk of T-cell lymphoma (p < 0.001 and p = 0. 01, respectively). However, after the exclusion of 4 cases due to physician suspected T-cel l lymphoma prior to exposure, the risks were only significant for patients exposed to Protopic and not Elidel (p < 0.001, p = 0.086, respectively) (Hui et al 2009) .

The safety and efficacy of Eucrisa were demonstrated in 2 identically designed, randomiz ed, Phase III, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials in a total of 1522 patients with moderate atopic dermatitis BSA et al 2016) . The primary endpoint of success was defined as the proportion of subjects at Day 29 who were clear or almost clear with a 2-grade improv ement from baseline by the Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) scale. More pati ents receiving Eucrisa vs vehicle achieved the primary endpoint of ISGA success (Study A D-301: 32.8% vs = 38; Study AD-302: 31.4% vs 18.0%, p < 0.001), with a greater percentage achieving cl ear/almost clear overall (51.7 % vs 40.6%, p = 48.5% vs 29.7%, p < 0.001). In addition, Eucrisa-treated patient s achieved greater ISGA score improvements and improvemen t in pruritus earlier (both p < 0.001). An open-label extension trial o f AD-301 and AD-302 evaluated th e safety of Eucrisa in 517 patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis for 48 weeks. Patients underwent an average of 6 treatment periods and used an average of 133 grams of ointment/month . Most treatment-emergent AEs wer e mild (51.2%) or moder ate (44.6%) and were considered unrelated to treatmen t with Eucrisa (93.1%). The most commonly observed 1% of included atopic dermatitis flares (3.1%), application site pain (2.3%), and application site infection (1.2%). Most patients (77.8%) did no t require rescue medications. Children a nd adolescents made up 48% o f those patients that initiated rescue therapies ( Eichenfield et al 2017 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Treatment guidelines generally agree that a stepwise approach t o treatment is needed. Nonpharmacological therapies (ie, lukewarm baths, skin moistu rizers, etc.) are followed by t opical corticosteroids and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors. Low to high potency topical cort icosteroids are the standard of care, and strength is select ed based on severity, duration of treatment, location of exace rbation, and age of the patient. Elidel and Protopic are topica l calcineurin inhibitors that are recommended as second-line therapy in patients who fail or cannot tolerate corticosteroids. Eucrisa has not yet been added to the guidelines (Eichenfield et al 2014a, Eichenfield et al 2014b, Schneider et al 2013, Sidbury et al 2014, Tollefson et al 2014) . SAFETY SUMMARY Elidel and Protopic Boxed warning: Although a causal relationship has not been esta blished, rare cases of malignancy (eg, skin and lymphoma) have been reported in pat ients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors. Avoid continuous long-term use, in any age group, and limit application to areas of involvem ent with atopic dermatitis. Both agents are not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age. Only Protopic 0.03% ointment is indicated for use in children 2 to 15 year s of age; Elidel is indicated for children 2 years and older and adults. Key Warnings/Precautions: Do not use on malignant or pre-malignant skin conditions. Resolve bacterial or viral inf ections at the treatment site. While using avoid ex posure to sunlight. Do not use in immunocompromised patients. AEs: Application site irritation and reactions such as skin bur ning, itching, redness, and rash . Hypersensitivity reactions can also occur. A 5-year, open-label, multicenter study evaluated the use of Elidel in 2418 infants compared to topical corticosteroids (Sigurgeirsson et al 2015) . The primary endpoint was safet y; the secondary endpoint was l ong-term efficacy defined as a score of 0 to 5 on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) . Topical corticosteroids in cluded low potency such as poten cy such as hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%. For safety, no differences between the groups were observed for growth r ate or bacterial or viral infe ctions. More Elidel patients re ported bronchitis (p = infected eczema (p < 0.001), impetigo (p = 0.045), and nasopharyngitis (p = 0.04). Serious infections and infestations were similar between the groups. Two malignancies occurred in t he corticosteroid-treated gr oup, and one benign tumor was reported in the Elidel-treated group. Over the 5-year perio d, 88.7% and 92.3% of the E lidel- and corticosteroid- treatment groups, respectively, r eported overall IGA treatment success. Significant attriti on occurred with only 69.4% and 72.1% of Elidel- corticos nsitivity to Eucrisa or any com ponent of the formulation 265 Data as of March 4, 2019 LS/KMR Page 5 of 7 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Warnings/precautions: Hypersensitivity reactions, inc luding contact urticaria, have o ccurred in patients treated with Eucrisa. Hypersensitivity should be suspected in the event of severe pruritus, swelling, and erythema at the appl ication site or at a distant site. If signs and symptoms of hyperse nsitivity occur, Eucrisa should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. AEs: In pivotal studies AD-301 and AD-302, 1012 patients (2 to 79 ye ars of age) with mild to mode rate atopic dermatitis were treated with Eucrisa twice daily for 4 weeks. The AE repor ted 6/499 [1%] of vehicle-treated patients) was application sit e pain, referring to skin sensations such as burning or stinging. Less common (< 1%) AEs in patients treated with Eucrisa included contact urticaria. No safety signals were identifi ed from vital signs or laborator y assessments in the pivotal studies or in the 48-week, long-term safety extension study (Eucrisa formulary submission dossier 2016, Paller et al 2016) .

CONCLUSION The topical calcineurin inhibitors, Elidel (pimecrolimus 1% cre am) and and ointment), are indicated as second-line therapies for the short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment dermatitis (Elidel: atopic dermatitis) in (Elidel: 2 and 0.1% in adults, 0.03% in pati ents 2 to 15 years of age) who have failed to respond adequat ely to other topical prescrip tion treatments, or when those treatments are not advisable. The FDA added another agent to the atopic dermatitis armamentarium with the approval of Eucrisa (crisaborole) ointment for the topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in patients 2 years of age. The topical anti-inflammatory agents work by way of several mec hanisms of action; however , the exact mechanism of action in atopic dermatitis is not known. Elidel and Protopic i nhibit calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase, with affinity i mmunophilin-12 (FKBP-12). Protop ic and Elidel provide T-cell activation, which is theor ized to be the primary mode of inflammation reduction in at opic dermatitis. Eucrisa is a non-steroidal treatment option wi th a novel mechanism of action . In patients with atopic dermatitis, PDE-4 activity increases circulating inflammato ry cells resulting in increased cytokine production. It is be lieved that Eucrisa enhances cellular control of inflammation by inhibiting PDE-4 and its ability to degrade intracellular cAMP, thereby suppressing the release of cytokines (Clinical Pharmacology 2019, Paller et al 2016) . Several head-to-head studies comparing the efficacy of the calc ineurin inhibitors have been conducted. A meta-analysis of 3 studies directly comparing Elidel and Protopic evaluated the change from baseline in EASI score at week 6 of treatment (Paller et al 2005) . Results favored treatment wit h Protopic, and AEs between the groups were similar. Another meta-analysis evaluating Elidel, Protopic, topical cort icosteroids, and vehicle pr eparations demonstrated a significantly greater change in EASI score in patients using Pr otopic compared to patients using Elidel in addition to better Investigator Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment in pati ents with moderate to severe disease (Ashcroft et al 2005) . Protopic was found to be more effective than mild topical cor ticosteroids and equally effective as moderately potent topical corticosteroids (El-Batawy et al 2009) . Concerns regarding the long-ter m safety of the topical calcineu rin inhibitors have been addr essed in the guidelines and position papers outlin ed in this review. In 2005, the FDA relea sed a Public Health Advisory to communicate the potential risk of cancer of these products to healthcare providers and pa tients. The FDA has advised that Elidel and Protopic be used only as labeled and asked providers and patients to consider these agents only as second-line therapies; new labeling was approv ed in early 2006 (FDA press release 2006) . Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be associated with immunosuppression or malignancy. Eucrisa demonstrated short-term efficacy over vehicle ointment in 2 identically designed , 28-day, Phase III, randomized, double-blind trials; more patients receiving Eucrisa vs vehicle achieved the primary endpoint of ISGA success, with a greater percentage of Eucrisa-tr eated patients achieving clear/ almost clear overall. Over 28 days, application site pain was the most commonly reported AE. Unpublished data gleaned fro m the 48-week, long-term study revealed no significant safety signals. Current guidelines for the treatment of atopic dermatitis recom mend the use of topical corticosteroids as first-line treatment and recommend the use of topical Elidel or Protopic i n those patients intolera nt or unresponsive to corticosteroids or in whom corticosteroids are contraindicated or when corticosteroid-sparing measures may be desired. Eucrisa has not yet been added to the guidelines (Eichenfield et al 2014a, Eichenfield et al 2014b, Schneider et al 2013, Sidbury et al 2014, Tollefson et al 2014) .

Therapeutic Class Overview Insulin and Combination Agents INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus is defined a s a group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia that result from defects in the secretion and action of insulin (American Diabetes Associatio n [ADA] Diabetes Basics 2019). The classification of diabetes includes four clinical classes: 1) Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) which results from beta-cell (- cell) destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency; 2) Type 2 diabetes (T2DM ) which results from a progressive insulin secretory defect on the background of insul in resistance; 3) Other speci fic types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., genetic defec ts in -cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, dis eases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis), and drug- or chemical-induced (such as in the treatment of H IV/AIDS or after organ transplantation; and 4) Gestati onal diabetes mellitus (diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy t hat is not clearly overt diabetes) (ADA 2019). In 2015, an estimated 30.3 m illion people, or 9.4%, of the Unit ed States (US) popul ation had diabetes mellitus, with 7.2 million estimated to be undiagnosed (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2017). The insulin products are approved for use in the management of both T1DM and T2DM. Other (SGLT2) inhibitors, combination products. Insulin is used as replacement t herapy in patients with diabete s, replacing deficient endogenous insulin and temporarily restoring the ability of the body to properly utilize carbohydrates, fats, and protei ns. Insulin is secreted by the -cells in the pancreas and lowers blood glucose by fa cilitating peripheral glucose uptake into cells and by inhibiting gluconeogenesis in the liver. In addition to its glycemic effec ts, insulin has anabolic properties, enhancing protein synthesis, inhibiting lipolysis in adipocytes, and stimulating lipogenesis (Powers 2018). The first insulin products were d erived from animal sources, pr imarily pork and beef; however, they are no longer available in the US. These older products have been replaced wi th human insulin and insulin analogs. Human insulin is biosynthesized utilizing recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA ) with strains of Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) and is structurally identical to endogenous in sulin. Insulin analogs ar e also derived from recombinant DNA technology. They a re structurally different fro m human insulin but have comparable glucose-lowering effects. The insulin analogs di ffer in the addition, delet ion, or substitution of ami no acids on the B chain (Powers 2018). Insulin analogs available today i nclude insulin aspart, glulisine , and insulin lispro. The primary differences between commercially available insulin products revolve around pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinet ic properties, particularly on set and duration of action. I ndividual insulin products are often classified into categor ies based on their onset and d uration of action. Bolus insulin products, also know n as rapid- or short-acting in sulin, include insulin aspart, i nsulin glulisine, insulin lispro, and certain human insulins. Unique formulations within this category include a rapid-acting, human insulin inhalation powder, and a higher strength of rapid-acting insuli n lispro that provides 200 units (U) per milliliter (U-200). In September 2017, Fiasp (insulin aspart) was approved (Novo Nordisk news release 2017). Fiasp is a new formulation of Novolog that cont ains niacinamide. Niacinamide helps to increase the speed of initial insulin absorption, resulting in an ons et of appearance in the blood in an estimated 2.5 minutes . Additionally, in December 2017, Admelog (insulin lispro) was the first short-acting insul in approved as a \"follow- on\" product th rough the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) abbreviated 505(b)(2) pathway (FDA news release 2017). Basal insulin products, also know n as intermediate- or long-act ing insulin, include neutral protamine insulin degludec, insulin detemir, and insulin glargi ne. Unique products within this category include a formulation of insulin glargine that provides 300 U of insulin glargine per mL and enables patients to utilize a higher dose in one injection. Additionally , Basaglar (insulin glargine ) was approved under the FD A 505(b)(2) pathway. (Fierce Biotech FDA press release 2015, Drugs@FDA 2019). Insulin therapy is us ually administered by subcutaneous (SC) in jection, which allows for prolonged absorption and less pain compared to intramuscular ( IM) injection. Currently there are no generic insulin products available. Of note, insulin products are available by prescr iption, as well as over-the-cou nter (OTC) (short- and intermediate-acting products only). This review will focus on the in sulin preparations and combination insulin/GLP-1 agonist pro ducts outlined in Table 1 for their respective FDA-approved i ndications.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Rapid- and Short-Acting Insulins Clinical trials conducted with the newer insulin analogs have s hown that they are at least as ef fective as the older insulin formulations. A large meta-analys is revealed that both insulin aspart and insulin lispro produ ced comparable lowering of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with T2DM compared to regular insulin (Plank et al 2005). In patients with T1DM, insulin lispro and insulin aspart produced small, but sig nificant differences in lowering HbA1c compared to regular insulin. Clinical trials c omparing insulin glulisine to regular insulin demonstrated si milar results, with at least comparable decreases in HbA1c a nd a few trials r eporting a sign ificantly greater decrease in HbA1c when compared to regular insulin in patient s with T1DM and T2DM (Dailey et al 2004, Fullerton et al 2016, Garg et al 2005, Rayman et al 2007). The rapid-acting analogs have demonstrated a more favorable pos t-prandial glycemic profile compared to regular insulin in patients with T1DM or T2DM (Anderson et al 1997a, Chen et al 2006, Dailey et al 2004, Melo et al 2019, Raskin et al 2000, Vignati et al 1997). Most trials reported comparable rates of h ypoglycemia between r apid-acting insulin analogs and regular insulin (Anderson et al 1997b, Bretzel et al 2004, Chen et al 2006, Colquitt et al 2003, Dailey et al 2004, Fairchild et al 2000, Garg et al 2005, Home et al 2006, Mc Sorley et al 2002, Mortensen et al 2006, Plank et al 2005, Raskin et al 2000, Vignati et al 1997). One large trial of patients wi th T1DM reported a 12% lower incidence of hypoglycemia with insulin lispro compared to regular insulin (p < 0.001) (Anderson et al 1997a). In another trial, a significantly lower frequency of nocturnal hypoglycemia was rep orted in patients with T2DM pat ients with insulin glulisine compared to regular insulin ( 9.1% vs 14.5%; p = 0.029) (Rayman et al 2007). A meta-analysis comparing rapid-acting agents with regular insulin in pati ents with T1DM found that rapid-acting agents are associated with less total hypoglycemic episodes (ri sk ratio [RR], 0.93; 95% confidence 0.55; 95% to 0.76), sever 95% CI, to -0.10) Melo et al 2019). In contrast, in a Cochrane review comparing rapid-acting insuli ns with regular insulin in adult, non-pregnant patients with T2DM, no clear significant differences were found between the groups for a ll-cause mortality or hypoglycemia events ( Fullerton et al 2018 ). 272 Data as of February 6, 2019 SS-U/MG-U/CME Page 5 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Afrezza was evaluated in both T1 DM and T2DM patients; in a 24-w eek open-label (OL), active-controlled (AC), non- inferiority trial, patients with T1DM on basal insulin were randomized to receive prandial of 0.4% red uction of HbA1c from baseline, but reductions were significantly less with Afrezza compared to insulin aspart and fewer Afrezza patients achi eved a HbA1c target of < 7% (Bode et al 2015). T2DM patients inadequately cont rolled on oral antidiabetic age nts (OADs) were randomized to receive Afrezza or placebo in a double-blind (DB) trial. At wee k 24, treatment with Afrezza provided a statistically significantly greater mean reduction in HbA1c than placebo (Rosenstock et al 2015[a]). Fiasp was evaluated in the Onset c linical trial program. Onset 1 (Russell-Jones et al 2017) was a 26-week, Phase 3, AC, RCT that compared Fiasp (meal time and postmeal) to Novolog in patients with T1DM. Bot h mealtime and postmeal Fiasp were demonstrated to be noninferior to Novolog in change in HbA1c (Estimated treatment difference [ETD], -0.15; p < 0.0001; ETD 0.04%; p < 0. 0001, respectively). Onset 2 (Bowering et al 2017) was a 26-week, Phase 3, DB, AC, RCT in T2DM patients on insulin and OADs. Patients were randomi zed to receive mealtime Fiasp (n = 345) or Novolog (n = 344). Fiasp demonstrated noninferiority to Novolog in HbA1 c lowering (ETD p < 0.0001). Onset 3 (Rodbard et al 2017) was an 18-week, Phase 3, OL, RCT in T2DM patients inadequately controlled on basal insulin and OADs. Patients randomized to recei ve mealtime Fiasp + basal insu lin (n = 116), or basal insulin alone (n = 120). The addition of Fiasp to basal insulin demonstrated superior HbA1c lowering from baseline (ETD -0.94%; p < 0.0001 for superiority ) and significantly more patients achieved an HbA1c < 7.0% (60.3% vs 18.3%; OR, 9.31; p < 0.0001); however, with the addition of Fiasp, there was an increase in the freque ncy of severe or blood glucose (BG)-confirmed hypoglycemic episodes (RR, 8.24 ; p < 0.0001) and modest weight gain. The safety and efficacy of Admelog, the first \"follow-on\" rapid -acting insulin, were evaluated in two 26-wk, Phase 3, OL, PG, RCTs in both T1DM ( N = 506) (SORELLA 1; Garg et pat ients (SORELLA 2; Derwahl et al 2018). Patients were randomized to receive Admelog or its reference pr oduct, Humalog. Cha nge in HbA1c in Admelog-treated patients was f ound to be noninferior in both tr ials (SORELLA 1: squar -0.215 to 0.067). Rates of hypoglycemia were similar between the treatment arms in both trials. Head-to-head trials of rapid-acting analogs suggest comparable effectiveness in terms of d ecreasing HbA1c, achieving similar self-monitored glucose profiles, rates of hypoglycemia, and achieving glycemic goals in patients with T1DM (Dreyer et al 2005, Philotheou et al 2011, Van Ban et al 2011). Long-Acting Insulins While not consistently demonstrated, data suggest that long-act ing insulin analogs are superior to isophane (NPH) insulin in decreasing HbA1c, a s well as the incidence of hypogl ycemia in patients with T1DM and T2DM as demonstrated by the results of s everal active-comparator trials and meta-analyses (Bartley et al 2008, Bazzano et al 2008, Buse et al 2009, Chase et al 2008, De Leeuw et al 2005, Fritsche et al 2003, Garber et al 2007, Haak et al 2005, Heller et al 2009, Hermansen et al 2004, Hermansen et al 2006, Home et al 2004, Horvath et al 2007, K\u00f8lendorf et al 2006, Lee et al 2012, Monta\u00f1ana et al 2008, Pan et al 2007, Pieber et al 2005, Philis-Tsimikas et al 2006, Raslov\u00e1 et al 2007, Ratner et al 2000, Riddle et al 2003, Robertson et al 2007, Rosenstock et al 2005, Russell-Jones et al 2004, Siegmund et al 2007, Standl et al 2004, Tan et al 2004, Tricco et al 2014, Vague et al 2003, Yenigun et al 2009, Yki- J\u00e4rvinen et al 2000, Yki-J\u00e4rvinen et al 2006). The safety and efficacy of the long-acting anal og Toujeo (insul in glargine U-300) (insulin glargine U-100) in OL , randomized, active-controlled, parallel studies of up to 26 weeks in patients with T1DM and T2DM. The reductions in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose wi th Toujeo were found to be si milar to that of Lantus, including patient s aged 65 years (Home et al 2018, Bolli et al 2015, Home et al 2015, Riddle et al 2014[b], Ritzel et al 2018, Yki-J\u00e4rvinen et al 2014). A 2018 meta-analysis comparing T oujeo with Lantus in patients w ith T1DM and T2DM found that Toujeo was associated with a reduced risk o f nocturnal hypoglycemia (RR, 0.81; 95% CI , 0.69 to 0.95) and a slight in HbA1 (effect size, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.14 et al 2018 ). Tresiba (insulin degludec) was evaluated in more than 5,600 T1D M and T2DM patients throughout 9 pivotal studies and 5 extensio n studies (BEGIN clini c al program). In 8 of the pivotal trials, Tresiba was non-inferior to Lantus (insulin glargine U-100) or Le vemir (insulin detemir) in lowering HbA1c from baseline, w ith similar rates of hypoglycemi a; in 5 trials, the rate of n octurnal hypoglycemia was significantly lower with Tresi ba compared to Lantus or Levemir (Davies et al 2014, Garber et al 2012, Gough et al 2013, Heller et al 2012, Mathieu et al 2013, Meneghini et al 2013[a], Onishi et al 2013, Zinman et al 2012).

The HbA1c and hypoglycemia trends were also observed in the published extension trials (Bode et al 2013, Davies et al 2016, Hollander et al 2015, Rodbard et al 2013). In the ninth pivotal trial, Tre siba lowered HbA1c significantl y more than oral sitagliptin 100 mg once daily in patients with T2DM who were receiving 1 or 2 conc omitant background OAD agents (treatment difference, -0.43; 95% CI, -0.61 to -0.24; p < 0.001), but ther e were significantly more ep isodes of overall confirmed hypoglycemia (p < 0.0001) (Philis-Tsimikas et al 2013). Across the BEGIN trials, a consistently increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular ev ents (MACE) was observed with Tresiba. At the request of an FDA Advisory Committee, Novo Nordisk conducted a pre-specified meta-analysis of MACE, which included a pooled a nalysis of 8,068 patients from 1 6 Phase 3 trials conducte d for Tresiba monotherapy and insulin degludec/insulin aspart (Ryzodeg). According to the 2012 analysis, there was a consistent trend towards harm in the pooled insulin degludec groups compared to active c omparators (hazard ratio [HR], 1.67; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.75). Additional post-hoc analyses consistently trended toward s harm regardless of endp oint, effect measure, analysis method, and subgroup analyses (FDA Briefing Document 2012, Novo Nordisk Briefing Document 2012). The large, DB, active-comparator DEVOTE trial was subsequently initiated to prospectively and rigorously compare the cardiovascular (CV) safety of Tresiba to Lantus in patients with T2DM at high risk for CV events. The primary composite endpoint of death from C V causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke occurred in 8.5% of the Tresiba group and 9.3% of the Lantus group (HR, 0.91; 95 % CI, 0.78 to 1.06; p < 0.001 for non-inferiority), confirming non-inferiority Tresiba to Lantus in terms of CV safety. Tresiba also demonstrated statistically significantly lower rates of sev ere hypoglycemia (odds ratio [O R] for severe hypoglycemic e vents, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.89; p < 0.001 for superiority) (Marso et al 2017). The efficacy of Tresiba vs Lantus in reducing the rate of sympt omatic hypoglycemic episodes in patients with T1DM and T2DM was examined in the SWITCH 1 and SWITCH 2 trials, respectively. These 65-week, DB, crossover trials enrolled patients with hypoglycemia risk fa ctors to receive Tresiba or L antus. In both trials, Tresi ba was found to cause fewer symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes (SWITCH 1: estimated rate rat io [ERR], 0.89; p < 0.001; SWITCH 2: ERR, 0.70; p < 0.001) and nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes (SWITCH 1: ERR, 0. 64; p < 0.001; SWITCH 2 : ERR, 0.58; p < 0.001) during the maintenance period than Lantus (Lane et al 2017, Wysham et al 2017) . A meta-analysis of 18 trials w ith 16,791 patients compared the safety and efficacy of Tresiba to Lantus, and similarly found that Tresiba was associat ed with a significant reduction in risk for all confirmed hypoglycemia during the maintenance treatment period (E RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.92; p=0.001), nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia entire (ERR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.80; p,0.001) and maintenance treatment periods (ERR, 0 .65; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.71; p,0.001), and a significantly fasting plasma glucose found to reduce the incidence of severe h ypoglycemia in patients with T2D, but not T1D ( Zhang et al 2018) . Additionally, Tresiba was evaluat ed for safety and efficacy in pediatric patients (ages 1 to 17) (N = 350) with T1DM in a 26-week, randomized, OL trial. Tresiba was non-inferior to Lant us with a difference in HbA1c reduction from baseline of 0.15% (95% CI, -0.03 to non-inferiority margin, 0.4%) (Tresiba prescribing information 2016). The safety and efficacy of Basagl ar (insulin glargine U-100) co mpared to Lantus (insulin glargine U-100) were evaluated in 2 pivotal studies enrolling 534 and 744 patient s with T1DM (ELEMENT 1 trial) and T2 DM (ELEMENT 2 trial), respectively. Both tr ials were multicenter, parallel group, randomized controlled trials (RCTs); ELEMENT 1 was OL and ELEMENT 2 was DB. Both trials w ere condu cted over 24 weeks; however, ELEMENT 1 also included a 28-week comparative safety extension per iod. Mealtime insulin lispro wa s administered 3 times daily in both groups within the ELEMENT 1 trial. OAD medication was permitted in conjunction wi th insulin treatment within the ELEMENT 2 trial. The primary efficacy endpoint tested the non-inferiority of agents by the reduction in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks. In both ELEMENT 1 and ELEMENT 2, Bas aglar and Lantus had similar and significant (p < 0.001) within-group decreases in HbA1c values from baseline. B asaglar met non-inferiority cri teria compared to Lantus for change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks in both tria ls 1: to 0 .175; p > 0.05). There were no statistically signific ant differences between treatment groups for the rate of eac h category of hypoglycemia (total, nocturnal, severe) at 24 or 52 weeks in ELEMENT 1 and at 24 weeks in ELEMENT 2 (p > 0.05 for all treatment comparisons). No significant differences between treatment grou ps were seen for change from baseline in body weight (ELEMENT 1, week 24 and 52: both p > 0.05; ELEMENT 2, week 24: p > 0.05) (Blevins et al 2015, Rosenstock et al 274 Data as of February 6, 2019 SS-U/MG-U/CME Page 7 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Basaglar has also been compared to Lantus when used in combinat ion with OADs in patients with T2DM. ELEMENT 5 was a 24-week trial an d included predominately Asian (48%) and White (46%) pat ients. Basaglar met non- inferiority criteria compared to Lantus for change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks (- 1.25% vs -1.22%; -0.04%; 95% CI, -0.22 to 0.15). O ther 24-week efficacy and safe ty outcomes were similar between groups ( Pollom et al 2019 ). At this time, there is a lack of substantial head- to-head data demonstrating the superiority of one long-acting insulin analog over another. When comparing the long-acting insulin ana logs head-to-head, several trials have demonstrated non-inferiority among the product s when used in the management of T1DM and as add-on therapy in patients with T2DM (Heller et al 2009, Hollander et al 2008, Pieber et al 2007, Raskin et al 2009, Rosenstock et al 2008, Swinnen et al 2010). In one head-to-head trial of Lantus and metformin vs Levemir an d metformin, Lantus had greater HbA1c lowering, but Levemir demonstrated less w eight gain and hypoglycemia (Meneghini et al 2013[b]). A 2011 Cochrane review (included 4 trials; N = 2250) concluded that Lantus and Levemir are equally effective in achieving and maintaining glycemic control (HbA1c). The review also found no differences in overall, nocturnal, and severe hypoglycemic events (Swinnen et al 2011). A 2018 meta-analysis similarl y found no differences in HbA1c reduction between insulin deglud ec, determir, or glargine in T1DM and T2DM patients, but the incidence of hypoglycemia was less with degludec as compared to glargine (no cturnal 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.82) ( Holmes et al 2018). To further inform the differenc es between basal insulin agents, a network meta-analysis ( included 41 trials, of which 25 trials included patients on ba sal-oral therapy; N = 15,746) evaluated the safety and efficacy of Toujeo (insulin glargine U-300) vs other basal insulin therapies in the treatme nt of T2DM. The authors found that the change in HbA1c was comparable between Touj eo and Levemir (difference, Tresiba (difference , -0.12; CrI, -0.42 to 0.2). Additionally, t here were no differences in nocturnal or documented symptomatic hypoglycemic events (Freemantle et al 2016). Combination Insulins A direct comparative trial eval uating 2 types of premixed bipha sic insulin (insulin lispro 50/50 and insulin aspart 70/30) demonstrated similar result s in terms of reducing HbA1c (Domeki et al 2014). Another trial comparing biphasic insulin to basal plus prandial insulin in T2 DM demonstrated that basal plus prandial insulin therapy was slightly more effective than premixed insulin with less hypoglycemia (Riddle et al 2014[a]). Other Evidence A systematic review that includ ed 11 studies and compared the efficacy and safety of biosimilar insulins (Basaglar and Admelog) to their reference products found comparable pharmacok inetic and/or pharmacodynamic parameters, clinical efficacy and immunogenicity, and adverse events between the bio similar agents and their reference products ( Tieu et al 2018) . Insulin therapies have been compa red to GLP-1 agonists with mixed study results. A study comparing glycemic control with Lantus vs exenatide demonstr ated cont rol was sustained with exenatide (Diamant et al 2012). Other studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 agonists are statist ically non-inferior to Lantus for change in HbA1c (Inagaki et al 2012, Weissman et al 2014). Studies comparing the addition of GLP-1 agonists to Lantus wer e found to be non-inferior to the addition of thri ce daily insulin lispro to Lantus (Diamant et al 2014, Rosenstock et al 2014). In terms of clinical outcomes, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) have demonstrated that i ntensive glycemic control with insulin significantly reduces the rate of onset and progression of diabetic complications when compared to standard therapy (DCCT 1993, UKPDS 1998). Neither trial indicated the specific insulin formulations utili zed; however, in the UKPD S, the risk reduction in microvascular complic ations was related more toward tight glycemic control rather than to one specific therapy (UKPDS, 1998). Combination Products: Long-Acting Insulin and GLP-1 Receptor Ag onist A 2017 systematic review and meta -analysis evaluated the effica cy and safety of insulin degl udec/liraglutide vs insulin glargine/lixisenatide treatment in T2DM ( Cai 2017 ). The analysis included 8 trials. The absolute HbA1c change re lative to baseline with insulin glargi ne/lixisenatide wa s -1.50% and - 1.89% with insulin degludec/liraglutide; comparisons 275 Data as of February 6, 2019 SS-U/MG-U/CME Page 8 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Additi onally, there was no significant difference between the groups with regard to body weight changes. Soliqua (insulin glargine/lixisenatide) The efficacy and safety of insu lin glargine/lixisenatide were e valuated over 30 weeks in 2 P hase 3, active-comparator (AC), OL, RCTs, titled the LIXILAN trials: T2DM patients uncontrolled on ba sal insulin: The LIXILAN-L trial was a 2-treatment arm stu dy in 731 T2DM patients. At baseline, patients were recei ving basal insulin for at least 6 months at stable daily doses \u00b1 OADs. Patients who had an insulin glargine daily dose of 20 to 50 U were randomize d to either insulin glargi ne/lixisenatide 100/33 (n = 366) or insulin glargine 100 U/mL (n = 365). The maximum dose o f insulin glargine allowed in the trial was 60 U for both groups. For the primary endpoi nt, HbA1c reduc tion after 30 weeks of treatment, the LSMD between insulin glargine/lixisenatide and insulin glargine was statistically significant favoring combinati on therapy over monotherapy (LSMD, 0.5%; 95% CI, 0. 6 to 0.4; p < 0.0001) (Aroda et al 2016, FDA briefing document [Soliqua] 2016, FDA summary review [Soliqua] 2016). Comparative data vs GLP-1 recept or agonists: The LIXILAN-O tria l was a 3-treatment arm study in 1167 patients with T2DM who were inadequately controlled on metformin \u00b1 OADs. Patients who met HbA1c g oals based on prior therapy were then randomized to e ither insulin glargine/lixisen (n = 466), or lixisenatide (n = 233). The maximum dose of insulin gl argine allowed in the trial was 60 U. For the primary endpoint, insulin glargine/lixis enatide required a non-inferior HbA1c reduction over 30 we eks compared to insulin glargine (non-inferiority upper margin of 0.3%). After 30 weeks of treatment, the LSMD in HbA1c reduct ion met non- inferiority compared glargine 0.3%; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.2; p < 0.0001) and also demonstrated superiority for the endpoint (p < 0.0001). At week 30, the LSMD in HbA1c reduction between insulin glargine/lixisenatide and also s ignificant 0.9 to 0.7; p < (Rosenstock et al 2016, FDA briefing document [S oliqua] 2016, FDA summary review [Soliqua] 2016). Weight and hypoglycemic events: T reatment with insulin glargine /lixisenatide was associ ated with mean weight losses of up to 0.7 kg from bas eline across the aforementioned trials. Hypoglycemic rates w ere comparable for insulin glargine/lixisenatide and insulin glargine ; however, fewer lixi senatide-treated patients experienced documented symptomatic hypoglycemic events co mpared to insulin glargine/li xisenatide (6.4% vs 25.6%, respectively) (Aroda et al 2016, Rosenstock et al 2016, FDA summary review [Soliqua] 2016). Xultophy (insulin degludec/liraglutide) The efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/liraglutide were evaluated over 26 weeks in 9 Pha se 3, parallel-group, AC, RCTs, titled the DUAL trials (Xultophy dossier 2016). Currently, results from DUAL I through VII are available, and D UAL VIII and IX trials are ongoing; therefore, these trials will no t be discussed. The DUAL I, IV , VI, and VII trials were conducted in patients uncontro lled while administered OADs, and since insulin degludec/liraglutide is not FDA-approved for use in patients previously uncontrolled on OADs, these tria ls have been excluded from this review: T2DM patients uncontrolled on basal insulin and OADs: The DUAL II trial was a 2-treatment arm, DB study in 413 T2DM p atients that compared insulin degludec/liraglutide (n = 207) to insulin degludec (n = 206). Prior to randomization , uncontrolled patients were receiving basal insulin (20 to 40 U) and metformin \u00b1 OAD s. The maximum dose of insulin degludec allowed in the trial was 50 U, and the maximum allowed dose of liraglutide was 1.8 mg. HbA1c reduction from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment, the primary endpoint, was 1.9% for in sulin degludec/liraglutide and 0.9% for insulin degludec. The estimated treatment difference (ETD) for HbA1c stat istically combination in jectable therapy monotherapy (ETD, 1.1%; CI, 1.3 to 0. 8; p < 0.0001) (Buse et al 2014). The DUAL V trial was a 2-treatme nt arm, OL, non-inferiority stu dy in 557 T2DM patients that compared insulin degludec/liraglutide (n = 278) to i nsulin glargine (n = 279) and metformin. Prior to randomization, uncontrolled patients were receiving insulin glargine (20 to 50 U) and metfo rmin. The trial maximum dose of insulin degludec/liraglutide was 50 U of insulin degludec and 1.8 mg of liraglutide; there was no maximum dose for insuli n glargine. For the primary endpoi nt, an upper boun d of the 95% C I < 0.3% was required for non-inferiority, which was achieved. The HbA1c reduction from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment was -1.8% for insulin degludec/liraglutide and -1.1% for insulin glargine. The ETD fo r (Lingvay et al 2016).

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. The DUAL III trial was a 2-treat ment arm, OL study in 438 T2DM patients that compared insu lin degludec/liraglutide (n = 292) to the currently adminis tered maximum dose of GLP-1 r eceptor agonist (n = 146) and metformin \u00b1 OAD therapy. Prior to randomization, patients were receiving maximu m doses of liraglutide once daily or exenatide twice daily, according to the local labeling, and metformin \u00b1 OADs. T he trial maximum dose of insulin degludec/liraglutide was 50 U of insulin degludec and 1.8 mg of liraglutide. HbA1c r eduction from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment, the primary endpoint, was 1.4% fo r insulin degludec/liraglutide and 0.3% for unchanged dose s of GLP-1 receptor agonists. The ETD for HbA1c statistically therapy over m onotherapy (ETD, 0.94%; 95% CI, 1.1 0. 8; p 0.001) (Linjawi et al 2017). Weight and hypoglycemic events: Treatment with insulin degludec /liraglutide was associated with mean weight losses of up to 2.7 kg and weight gain of 2 kg from baseline across th e aforementioned trials. Hypoglycemia rates with insulin degludec/liraglutide were comparable to insulin degludec. However, compar ed to GLP-1 receptor agonists, the estimated rate ratio (ERR) was 25.36 (95% CI, 10.63 to 60.51; p < 0.001), demonstrating a sta tistically significantly higher rate of hypoglycemic episo des in the insulin degludec/li raglutide group vs the GLP- 1 receptor agonist group. Conversely, the ERR favored insu lin degludec/liraglutide over i nsulin glargine with a statist ically significantly higher rate of hypoglycemic episodes in the insulin glargine group (ER R, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.61; p < 0.001) (Buse et al 2014, Lingvay et al 2016, Linjawi et al 2017, Xultophy dossier 2016). Cardiovascular (CV) outcomes A number of key CV studies have been conducted with insulin gla rgine, insulin degludec, liragl utide, liraglutide has demon strated CV-positive outcomes. Studies with adequate power have not been conducted with the long-acting insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonist combina tion products. The ORIGIN trial was a randomiz ed trial without blinding conduc ted in 12,612 patients with CV risk factors plus impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or T2DM. Patients were randomized to receive insulin glargine or standard of care therapy, which included continuing their pre-existing glycemic control re gimen. CV risk factors at baseline included previous MI, str oke, angina, or revasculariza tion. After a median 6.2 year follow-up, no significant difference in the co-p rimary outcome s of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or death from CV caus es, and these events plus revascularization or hospitaliz ation for heart fa ilure (HF), we re observed. The rates of incident CV outcomes were similar in the insulin glargine and standard car e groups: 2.94 and 2.85 per 100 person-years , respectively, for the first co-primary outcome (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1. 11; p = 0.63) a nd 5.52 and 5.28 per 100 person-years, respectively, for the second co-primary outco me (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1. 11; p = (PC) tria l (N = 6068) was conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of lixisenatide vs placebo on CV outcomes in patients with T2DM who had a recent acute coronary syndrome event withi n 180 days of screeni ng. The primary endpoi nt was a composite of the fi rst occurrence of any of the following: death from CV c auses, non-fatal MI, non-fatal st roke, or hospitalization for unstable angina. The median follow-up was 25 months. It was fo und that the primary endpoint event occurred in 13. 4% of patients in the lixisenatide group and 13.2% in the placebo group (HR, 1.02; 95 % CI, 0.89 to 1.17), which demonstrated non- inferiority of lixisenatide to p lacebo (p < 0.001), but did not demonstrate superiority ( p = 0.81). The rates of the individual CV components of the primary endpoint were similar b etween the lixisenati de and placebo groups (Pfeffer et al 2015) . LEADER, a MC, DB, randomized, PC trial (N = 9340) was conducted to evaluate the long-term e ffects of liraglutide vs placebo on CV outcomes in patients with T2D M and high CV risk. The median follow-up was 3.8 years. It was found that the primary composite outco me (CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) occurred in fewer patients in the liraglutide group (13%) vs the placebo group (14. 9%) (HR, 0.87; 95% 0.78 to 0.97; p < 0.001 for noni nferiority; p = 0.01 for superiority). Mortality from CV causes was lower in th e liraglutide group (4.7%) vs the placebo group (6%) (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0. 93; p = 0.007). Additionally, the rate of death from any cause was lower in the liraglutide group (8.2%) vs the placebo group (9.6%) (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.7 4 to 0.97; p = 0.02).T he rates of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and ho spitalization for heart failure were non significantly lower in the lir aglutide group than in the placebo group (Marso et al 2016). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Insulin is the mainstay of ther apy for adult and pediatric pati ents with T1DM. Current guidelines recommend that most people with T1DM be treated with m ultiple daily injections (3 to 4 injections per day of basal and prandial insulin) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Either multiple daily injections or a continuous infusion can be considered, 277 Data as of February 6, 2019 SS-U/MG-U/CME Page 10 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In addition, the guidelines suggest that most people with T1DM should use insulin analogs to reduce hypoglycemia risk (ADA 2019, Chiang 2018, Handelsman et al 2015). According to current clinical guidelines regarding the management of T2DM, consideration should be given to initiating insulin therapy (with or withou t other agents) at the outset of treatment in newly diagnose d patients with markedly symptomatic and/or elevated blood glucose levels or HbA1c. Insu lin therapy is usually started once patients are not achieving glycemic goals with noninsulin therapies (ADA 2019, Davies 2018, Garber et al 2019, Handelsman et al 2015). Guidelines suggest that an insulin treatment program be designed specifically for an individual patient, to match the supply of insulin to his or her di etary/exercise habits and pre vailing glucose trends, as revealed through self-monitoring. Anticipated glucose-lowering effects should be balanced with th e convenience of the regim en in the context of an individual's specific therapy goals (ADA 2019, Davies 2018, Garber et al 2019, Handelsman et al 2015). The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and American College of Endocrinology (ACA) T2DM management algorithm identifies lifestyle therapies such as weight loss, comprehensive management of lipids and blood pressure, safety, and simplic ity as crucial factors of a T2DM regimen. The guideline notes that patients are unlikely to achieve glycemic tar gets with a third oral antihype rglycemic agent if their HbA1c level > 8% or in those with long-standing disease. A GLP-1 a gent may be considered, but man y patients will eventua lly require insulin. The guideline suggests basal (long-ac ting) insulin for those who ar e symptomatic with an entry HbA1c > 9.0%. Basal insulin analogs are preferred ove r NPH. If an intensified regimen is needed, the addition o f a GLP-1 agonist, SGLT2 inhibitor, or DPP-4 inhibitor can be n of basal insulin with a GLP-1 receptor agonist may offer greater efficacy than the oral agents. Prandial (rapid-ac ting) insulin prior to meals can be considered when the total daily dose of basal i nsulin exceeds 0.5 U/kg (Garber et al 2019). The guideline also states that newer basal insulin formulations (glargine U-300, and degludec U-100 and U-200) have more prolonged and stable p harmacokinetic and pharmacodyna mic characteristics than glargine U-100 and detemir. RCTs have reported equivalent glycemic control and low er rates of severe or confirmed hypoglycemia, particularly nocturnal hypoglycemia, compared to glargine U-100 and detemir insulin; however, no recommendation for specific insulin products is given. The ADA and European Associati on for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) offer similar emphasis on lifestyle modifications and CV disease risk managemen t. In the 2019 update to the ADA s tandards of medical care in diabetes, the pharmacologic treatment of T2DM was significantly changed to al ign with the ADA-EASD consensus report. The ADA guideline states that insulin ther apy (with or without addition al agents) should be initiated in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM with evidence of ongoing catabolism (weight loss ), if symptoms of hypergl ycemia are present, or when HbA1c levels ( 10%) or b lood glucose levels ( 300 mg/dL) are very high. The AD A and EASD recommend that, in most patients who requi re an injectable therapy, a GLP -1 agonist should be the firs t choice ahead of insulin. Due to the progressive nature of the disease, pat ients may even tually require insulin therapy ( ADA 2019, Davies 2018) . Certain patient factors can infl uence the choice of insulin the rapy. For patients with est ablished atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), insulin therapies with demonstrated CV disease safety (degludec and glargine U-100) should be considered. For patients with hypoglycemia issues, a basal insulin with lower risk of hypoglycemia should be considered (risk of hypoglycemia: degludec/gla rgine c ombination can be considered whe n first intensifying therapy to injectable products in patients with a HbA1c > 10% and/or if the patient is above the target HbA1c by > 2%. T he combination can also be considered in pati ents who require additional control after the addition of a GLP-1 agonist in the intensification algorithm. The American College of Cardiology published an expert consensu s decision pathway for pat ients with T2DM and ASCVD ( Das 2018 ). GLP-1 agonists, lir aglutide is the only agent in the class with proven benefits of reducing CV events. In contras t, lixisenatide is not associated with a r eduction in ASCVD event risk. Thus, both the ACC pathway and ADA guideline considers liragl utide as the preferred GLP-1 agent ( ADA 2019, Das 2018 ).

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Insulins are contraindicated dur ing episodes of hypoglycemia an d with hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the product. In addition, Afrezza is also contraindicated in patients with c hronic lung disease, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (C OPD), because of the risk of ac ute bronchospasm. Boxed Warnings: Afrezza has a Boxed Warning for the risk of acute bronchospasm in patients with chronic lung disease. Before initiating Afrezza, a detailed medical history, physical examin ation, and spirometry should be performed to identify potential lung disease in all patients. Warnings/Precautions: Insulin pens must never be shar ed between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using insulin vials must never reuse or share needles or syringes with another person. S haring poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. Frequent glucose monitoring and insulin dose reduction may be r equired in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. All insulins can cause hypokalem ia, which if untreated, may res ult in respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Long-term use of insulin can cau se lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Accidental mix-ups between basal insulin products and other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication er rors, patients should be instru cted to always check the insulin label before each injection. Severe, life-threatening, genera lized allergy, including anaphy laxis, can occur with insulin products. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, the insulin product should be discontinued. Administration of Humulin R U- 500 in syringes other that U-500 insulin syringes has resulted in dosing errors. Patients should be prescribed U- 500 syringes for use with Humul in R U-500 vials. The prescribed dose should always be expressed in units of insulin. Afrezza has additional respiratory -related warnings and precaut ions associated with i ts use including acute bronchospasm in patients with c hronic lung disease, decline in pulmonary function, and lung cancer. Adverse Events (AEs): Hypoglycemia is the most commonl y observed AE. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time which may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, m ay be life-threatening, or ca use death. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the preven tion and management of hypoglycemia . Weight gain, sodium retention and edema, and injection site rea ctions can occur. Additional AEs observed with the inhaled insulin, Afrezza, incl ude cough, throat pain or irrit ation, headache , diarrhea, productive cough, fatigue, nausea, decreased pulmonary function test, bronchitis, and ur inary tract infection. Thiazolidinediones can cause dose -related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Refer to the prescribing informat ion for all drugs that can inc rease or reduce th e glucose-lowering ability of insulin. Risk Evaluation and Miti gation Strategy (REMS) The FDA previously required a communication plan to inform heal th care professionals about the serious risk of acute bronchospasm associated with A frezza; however, in April 2018, the FDA determined that the communication plan has been completed and REMS is no longer needed. (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/d rugsatfda_docs/a Insulin and GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Contraindications: Both combination agents are contra indicated in patients with hy persensitivity to any com ponent of the products and during episodes of hypoglycemia.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Warnings and precautions are c onsistent with each individual ag ent and include pancreatitis, serious hypersensitivity reactions/allergic reactions, h ypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, the potential for overdose due to medication errors, acute kidney injury, hypokalemia, and the potential for fluid r etention and heart failure wit h use of thiazolidinediones. Prefilled pens should nev er be shared between patients (even if the needle is changed) due to the risk of transmission of blood-borne pathogens. Additional warnings and precautions for Soliqua include immunog enicity risks associat ed with the development of antibodies to insulin glargine and lixisenatide resulting in a loss of glycemic control and a lack of clinical studies showing macrovascular risk reduction. Additional warnings for X ultophy include a potential increased risk for acute gallbladder disease. AEs: The most common AEs reported wi th these agents include nausea, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection. Additional common AEs include hypoglycemia and allergic reactio ns with Soliqua and increa sed receptor agonist compon ents may cause delayed gastric emptying of oral medications. Certain medications may require adminis tration 1 hour before (ie, antib iotics, acetaminophen, oral co ntraceptives, or other medications dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy) or 11 hours after (ie, o ral contraceptives) administration of the GLP-1 receptor agonist. Monitor use closely when administered concomitantly with other medications that may affect glucose metabolism. Antiadrenergic medications (ie , beta blockers, clonidine, guane thidine, and reserpine) may mask the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. REMS programs: The FDA previously required a REMS program for Xultophy, which included a communication plan for alerting healthcare professionals about the risk of a cute pancreatitis a nd the potential risk of MTC; however, in December 2017, the FDA determined that the communication plan is no longer necessary and that a REMS is no longer required (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/d rugsatfda_docs/a ppletter/2017/208583Orig1s001ltr.pdf ). th gastroparesis were exclu ded from trials; therefore, agents are generally not recommend ed in cases of severe gastrop aresis. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION Injection sites should be rotated within the same region (abdom en, thigh or upper a rm) from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. Dose adjustments in patients wi th renal and/or hepatic dysfunction may be required with the insulin products. In elderly patients, caution should be taken with initial insul in dosing and subsequent dose changes to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Table 4.

The primary differences between commercially available in sulin products revolve around pharmacodynamic and pharma cokinetic properties, particularly onset and duration of action. Individual insulin products are classified by t heir onset and d uration of actions and may fall into one of four categories: rapid-, short-, intermediate-, or long-acting insulins. Insulin therapy is usually administered by SC injection, which allows for prolonged absorption and less pain compared to IM injection . No generic insulin products are currently available. Afrezza is a rapid-acting inhaled insulin. The inhalation route offers a less invasive alternat ive route of administration and improved convenience of administration compared with inject able rapid-acting insulins. Due to this different route of administration, the most common AEs associated with Afrezza in clinical trials were hypoglycemia, cough, and throat pain or irritation. The safety and efficacy of ins ulin therapy in the management of diabetes are well established. Clinical trials have demonstrated that the newer rapid - and long-acting insulin anal ogs are as effective as regular and isophane (NPH) insulin in terms of glucose m anagement. The data also suggest t hat long-acting insulin analogs are superior to NPH in decreasing HbA1c and are associ ated with a lower incidence of h ypoglycemic events. Furthermore, head-to-head data do not consistently demonstrate t he superiority of one rapid- o r long-acting insulin analog over another. In terms of clinical outcomes, int ensive glycemic control with insulin has been shown to signi ficantly reduce the rate of onset and progression of diabetic complications when compared to standard therapy. Insulin is the mainstay of ther apy for adult and pediatric pati ents with T1DM. Current guidelines recommend that most people with T1DM be treated with m ultiple daily injections (3 to 4 injections per day of basal and prandial insulin) or continuous subc utaneous insulin infusi on. In addition, the guid elines suggest th at most people with T1DM should use insulin analogs to reduce hypoglycemia risk (ADA 2019, Chiang 2018, Handelsman et al 2015). According to current clinical guidelines regarding the management of T2DM, consideration should be given to initiating insulin therapy (with or withou t other agents) at the outset of treatment in newly diagnose d patients with markedly symptomatic and/or elevated blood glucose levels or HbA1c. Insu lin therapy is usually started once patients are not achieving glycemic goals with noninsulin therapies (ADA 2019, Davies 2018, Garber et al 2019, Handelsman et al 2015). Guideli nes suggest that an insulin treatment program be designed specifically for an individual patient, to match the supply of insulin to his or her di etary/exercise habits and pre vailing glucose trends, as revealed through self-monitoring. Anticipated glucose-lowering effects should be balanced with th e convenience of the regim en in the context of an individual's specific therapy goals (ADA 2019, Davies 2018, Garber et al 2019, Handelsman et al 2015). The ADA and EASD recom mend that in most pat ients who require an injectable therapy a GLP -1 agonist should be the first choice, ahead of insulin. Certain patient factors can influence the choice of insulin therapy and recommendations for certain products are made for t hose with ASCVD, CKD, and those with hypoglycemia issues ( ADA 2019, Davies 2018) . Combination, Long-Acting Insulin and GLP-1 Receptor oliqua) and insulin degludec/li (Xultophy) insulin incretin- combination ther apies that are FDA-approved as adjunctive therapy to d iet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult T2DM patients. The medications are administer ed through a fixed ratio pen. Sol iqua may be administered in doses of 15 to 60 U of insulin glargine and 5 to 20 mcg of lixisenatide, while Xultoph y may be administered in doses of 10 to 50 U of insulin degludec and 0.36 to 1.3 mcg of liraglutide SC once daily depen ding on prior treatment and dosages. Individualized dosing is recommended based on me tabolic needs, blood glucose m onitoring, glycemic cont rol, type of diabetes, and prior insulin use of the patient. These agents have been studied in combination with metformin, sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, insulin glargine and 0.8% vs lixisenatide. Xultophy demonstrated estimated treatment d ifferences in reduction s of 1% vs agonist exena tide twice daily). Across trials, Xultophy and Soliqua were associated with both weight losses and gains. Hypoglycemia r ates were mostly similar to those observed within the basal insulin monotherapy arms; ho wever, the GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with less hypoglycemic events (Aroda et al 2016, Buse et al 2014, FDA summa ry review [Soliqua] 2016, Lingvay et al 2016, Linjawi et al 2017, Rosenstock et al 2016). Several CV outcomes trials have been conducted in patients with T2DM who were administered basal insulin monotherapy or GLP-1 r eceptor agonist monother apy. Of these trials, the 285 Data as of February 6, 2019 SS-U/MG-U/CME Page 18 of 23 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Overall, the safety profiles o f these agents are similar. Xultophy has a boxed warni ng regarding the ri sk of thyroid C-cell tumors and is contraindicated in patients with a history of MTC or MEN 2. Other key warnings for these products include increased risks of pancreatitis , hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, the potential for overdose d ue to medication errors, acute kidney injury, hypokalemia, and the potential for fluid r etention and heart failure wit h use of thiazolidinediones. Soliqua has an additional warning and precaution regarding immu nogenicity risks associated with the development of antibodies which may result in the loss of glycemic control. Co mmon AEs include gastroint estinal effects (eg, nausea, diarrhea, etc), nasopharyngitis , headache, and up per respirator y tract infection. The ADA and EASD guidelines note that a basal insulin/GLP-1 ago nist combination can be considered when first intensifying therapy to injectabl e products in patients with a HbA1c > 10% and/or if above the target HbA1c by over 2%. The combination can al so be considered in patients who require additional control after the addition of a GLP-1 agonist in the intensification algorithm ( Diabetes Association. D iabetes Basics.

Therapeutic Class Overview Antidepressants, SSRI INTRODUCTION Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder characterized by symptoms such as depressed mood, anhedonia, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in a ppetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor conce ntration, thoughts of worthles sness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide ( Simon 2015 ). MDD is associated with higher rates of chronic disease, impaire d functioning, and increased healthcare utilization. The condition is more prevalent among females and persons aged 40 to 59. From 2009 to 2012, 7.6% of Americans 12 years of age or older had depre ssion (moderate or severe sym ptoms in the past 2 weeks) ( Pratt and Brody 2014 ). Current guidelines recommend first-line treatment with a second-generation antidepressant (SGA) and/or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The effe ctiveness of SGAs is generally comparable between and within classes of antidepressants, including select ive serotonin th e treatment of MDD in most patients ( American Psychiatric Association [APA] 2010, Qaseem et al 2016, Veteran's Affairs/ Department [VA/DoD] 2016 ). serotonin reuptake pump and increase postsynaptic serotonin receptor occupancy. This initial action may cause subsequent changes invo lved in treating depression. S SRIs are selective in that they have relatively little affinity for other types of receptor s. Reuptake inhibition occu rs soon after SSRIs are start ed, and the full therapeutic effects of SSRIs may not appear for 3 to 8 (or more) weeks afte r treatment has started ( Hirsch and Birnbaum 2017 ). Some of the SSRIs are also used to treat other psy chiatric diso rders besides MDD, including panic disorder, obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), gener alized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, stress disorder (PTSD), premenstrual dysphoric d isorder(PMDD)/premenstrual synd rome (PMS), and bulimia nervosa. GAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry. Symptoms o f GAD include restlessness, being easily fatigued, irritability, difficulty concentr ating, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances ( Bandelow et al 2012 ). OCD is characterized by recurrent intrusive thoughts, images, or urges (obsessions) that ty pically cause anxiety or distress, and by repetit ive mental or behavioral acts (compulsions) that the individual feels driven to perform, either in response to an obsession or acco rding to rules that he or she b elieves must be applied rigidly (Simpson 2016) . Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic a ttacks followed by concern about subsequent panic attacks or maladaptive change in b ehavior related to the attack s. Panic attacks are discrete periods of intense fear or discomfort accompanied by somati c and psychic symptoms (eg, pal pitations, sweating, trem bling, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea) ( APA 2009, Bandelow et al 2012 ). PMS is characterized by the pr esence of both physical and behav ioral (including affective) symptoms that occur repetitively in the se cond half of the menstrual cycle and inte rfere with some aspects of the woman's life. The APA defines PMDD as a severe form of PMS in which symptoms of anger , irritability, and internal tension are prominent (Yonkers and Casper 2016). PTSD is a clinically-signific ant condition with symptoms that h ave persisted for more than 1 month after exposure to a traumatic event and caused significant distress or impairment i n social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. PTSD can appear alo ne as the only diagnosis, or mo re commonly, with another co-occurring disorder, such as a substance use disorder or mood disorder (Veterans Affairs [VA]/Depar tment of Defense [DoD] 2017) . Social anxiety disorder is cha racterized by persistent fear of being observed or evaluated negatively by others in social performance or interaction situations. Patients with soc ial anxiety disorder often av oid social interactions or endure them with intense anxiety or distress ( Bandelow et al 2012 ). Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors, as well as frequent comorbid psychopathology (Engel et al 2017) . The scope of this rev iew will be the safety and efficacy of the SSRIs in the treatment of M DD and other psychiatric Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-ap proved indications. The SSRIs (7.5 mg) paroxetine mesylate formulation, is only FDA-approved for the treatment of moderate to vasomotor symptoms (VMS) asso ciated with menopause. This indication will not be addre ssed in this review.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY GAD There is a lack of data available directly comparing different serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (including SSRIs vs SNRIs) for GAD. Trials have generally s hown that all serotonergic reup take inhibitors studied have the same degree of effectiveness, ie, response rates of approximately 60 to 70% fo r the serotonergic reuptake inhibitors vs. 40% for the placebo. SSRIs that have been show n in randomized control trial s (RCTs) to be efficacious fo r GAD include paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram. Uncontrolled trials a nd experience suggest other SSRIs (eg, fluoxetine and fluvoxamine) are effective for GAD as well ( Bystritsky 2016 ). MDD A large body of literature suppo rts the superiority of SSRIs co mpared with placebo in the treatment of MDD. Although a few analyses suggest small advant ages of SNRIs over SSRIs in ra tes of remission, a preponderance of the data finds no significant evidence of the su periority of any other class o r agents over SSRIs. Most i ndividual trials and meta- analyses show no differences in efficacy among individual SSRIs ( APA 2010, VA/DoD 2016 ). A 2011 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) compar ative of adults with depressive disorders ( Gartlehner et al 2011 ). 294 Data as of October 6, 2017 AS/DKB Page 4 of 11 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Some analyses yielded statistically significant differences among treatments, but the magnitude s of differenc es were modest and probably not clinically relevant. Meta-analyses of head-to-head tria ls showed statistically signi ficantly greater response rates for escitalopram than citalopram (1 unpublished study and 5 published studies involvi ng 1802 patients) (odds ratio [OR], 1.49, 95% 1.07 to than fl uoxetine (4 studies involvi ng 960 patients) (OR, 1.42, 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.85). In several head-to-head trials, o verall efficacy in maintaining remission did not signi ficantly differ between escitalopram MDD and accom panying anxiety, 4 head-to-head trials suggested that ant idepressants have similar antidepressive efficacy. Two of these studies compared SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline). Overall, SGAs caused similar adv erse events (AEs); however, the frequency of specific events differed among some drugs. In addition, Discontinuation rates were similar between SSRIs and other SGAs (rang e of means, 15% to 25%). A multiple-treatments meta- analysis of 117 RCTs (n = 25,928) fo und clinically important States), sertraline, and venlafaxine for the acute tr eatment of adults with MDD. (Cipriani et al on mirtazapine, escital opram, venlafaxine, and sertral ine were significantly more likely to respond to therapy than those on duloxetine (OR 1.39, 1.33, 1.30 and 1.27, respect ively), fluoxetine (OR 1.37 , 1.32, 1.28, and 1.25, respectively), fluvoxamine (OR 1.41, 1.35, 1.30, and 1.27, resp ectively), and paroxetine (OR 1.35, 1.30, 1.27, and 1.22, respectively). Escitalopram and sertraline sh owed the best profile of acceptab ility, leading to significant ly fewer , qu asi RCT studies (n = 3097) ev aluated the efficacy and AEs of SSRIs vs placebo for OCD in adults. SSRIs as a gr oup were more effective than placebo in reducing the symp toms of OCD between 6 and 13 weeks post-treatme nt, measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessiv e Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) (weighted mean difference [WMD] -3.21, 95% CI -3. 84 to -2.57). The WMD for ind ividual SSRI drugs were simi lar and not statistically different. Based on 13 studies (2 697 participants ), SSRIs were more effective than placebo in achieving clinical response at post-treatment (rela tive risk [RR] 1.84, 95% CI 1.5 6 to 2.17). The pooled RR was shown to be similar between individual SSRI drugs. Alt hough reported AEs data were more limited, with few ex ceptions, the overall and individual AEs for the different SSRIs were always worse than for placebo and, in the majority of cases, the difference was statistically significant. N ausea, headache and insomnia we re always reported amongst the most common AEs in clinical trials for each of the drugs ( Soomro et al 2008 ). Panic Disorder A Cochrane review of 35 RCTs (n = 6785) evaluated antidepressants and benzodiazepines as monotherapy for adults with panic disorder. An analysis of 2 studies (n = 1316) direct ly comparing paroxetine with venlafaxine demonstrated similar response rat es for panic disorder ( RR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.7 5 to 1.23; 2 studies; 991 part icipants; I\u00b2 = 1%; high quality of evidence). Additionally, no diffe rence in response rate was detected between antidepres sants and benzodiazepines for panic disorder (RR 0.99; 0.67 to 1.47; 2 studies; 2 15 participants; low quality of evidence) (Bighelli et al 2016 ). In a meta-analysis of 50 studies (n = 5236) of antidepressants for panic disorder, the following antidepressants demonstrated superiority over p lacebo in the reduction from bas eline of overall anxiety symptoms (in increasing order of effectiveness): citalopram, ser traline, paroxetine, A Cochrane review of 31 RCTs (n = 6785) evaluated the effectiveness and safety of SSRIs for treating PMS.

The effec t size was moderate when st udies reporting end scores were pooled (for moderate dose SSRIs: SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.46 moderate heterogeneity I2 = 58%; low quality evidence). SSRIs were effective for symptom relief whether taken only in the luteal 295 Data as of October 6, 2017 AS/DKB Page 5 of 11 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

However, few studies directly compared luteal and continuous re gimens and more evidence is needed on this question. Withdrawals due to AEs were significantly more likely to occur in the SSRI group. In secon dary analyses, SSRIs were effective for treating specific types of symptoms (eg, psycholo gical, physical and functional symptoms, and irritability) (Marjoribanks et al 2013 ). PTSD A systematic review and meta-ana lysis of RCTs (n = 51 studies) evaluated the efficacy of a ll types of pharmacotherapy, as monotherapy, in reducing symp toms of PTSD. SSRIs were found to be statistically superior to placebo in reduction of PTSD symptoms but the effect size was small (standardized mean difference -0.23, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.12). Three drugs were significantly superior to p lacebo on either clinician- and self-rated PTSD symptom sev severity alone (fluoxetine and venlafaxine). Insufficient evi dence was found to support the preferential use of individual agents in either combat-rela ted or non-combat-related trauma ( Hoskins et al 2015 ). Social Anxiety Disorder A systematic review and meta-ana lysis of RCTs (41 studies) aime d to identify optimal treatment s for social phobia (ie, social anxiety disorder) ( Canton et al 2012 ). SSRIs were the most extensively tested in patients with social phobia, with 17 placebo-co ntrolled acute treatment RCTs reported. Almost half of the studies studied paroxetine, w ith 2 to 3 studies each fo r escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline. The pooled OR for response to each SSRI ranged between 1.98 (95% CI, 1.07 to 3.67) for fluoxetine and 3.41 (95% CI, 2 .51 to for The overall OR was 2.73 ( 95% CI, 1.67 to 4.48). With 1 exception, SSRIs had significant ly greater Clinical Global Impr essions (CGI) response rates compared with placebo. In general, SSRIs showed separation from placebo by weeks 4 to 6 on a number of response or other outcome measures; however SSRI-placebo di fferences tended to increase o ut to 12 weeks of treatment. There have been 4 studies assess ing the effect of continuation treatment with SSRIs in pat ients who have responded to acute treatment. In these rela pse prevention studies, patien ts were randomized to remain on their SSRI or were switched to placebo, under double-blind conditions. All 4 studi es showed robust effects of the SSRIs in preventing relapse of social phobia (pooled OR 0.25, 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.35) . CLINICAL GUIDELINES GAD World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Guidelines for the Pha rmacological Treatment of Anxiety Disorders, OCD and PTSD in Primary Care (Bandelow et al 2012 GAD options include buspirone and hydroxyzine. Benz odiazepines shoul d only be used for long-term treatment w hen other drugs or CBT have failed. MDD VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guide line for the Management of MDD (VA/DoD 2016) As first-line treatment for uncomplicated mild to moderate MDD, evidence-based psychotherapy or evidence-based pharmacotherapy should be offer ed. Selection should be based on patient preference, saf ety/side effect profile, history of prior response to a specific medication, family hist ory of response to a medica tion, concurrent medical illnesses, concurrently prescri bed medications, cost of medication, and provider training/competence. and bupropion. The evidence does not support recommending a specific psychothe rapy or pharmacotherapy over another. In patients who have demonstrated partial or no response to ini tial maximized monotherapy after a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks of treatment, switching to another monothe rapy (medicat ion or psychotherapy) or augmenting with a second medication or psychotherapy is recommended. In cases of severe MDD, combine d pharmacotherapy and psychother apy is recommended if initial monotherapy with an antidepressant did not achieve a response or remission. In p atients who have demonstra ted a partial response and are tolerating the current antidepressant, augmentation with another medication or psychotherapy is reasonable. 296 Data as of October 6, 2017 AS/DKB Page 6 of 11 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Nonpharmacologic Versus Pharmacologic Treatment of Adult Patien ts With MDD: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the American College of Physicians (ACP) (Qaseem et al 2016 ) Clinicians are recommended to s elect between either cognitive b ehavioral therapy or SGAs (SSRIs, SNRIs) to treat patients with after discussi ng treatment effects, AE profiles, cost, accessibility, and preferences with the patient (Grade: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). There are reported differences a mong SGAs in mild (constipation , diarrhea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, and somnolence) to major (sexual dysfunction and suicidality) A Es. Bupropion is associated with a lower rate of sexual AEs than fluoxetine and se rtraline, whereas paroxetine h as higher rates of sexual dysfunction than fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nefazodone, and se rtraline. Physicians and patient s should discuss AE profiles before selecting a medication. American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice Guideline for the Treatment of MDD: 3rd Edition (APA 2010 ) The effectiveness of antidepress ant medications is generally co mparable between classes and within classes of medications. Thus, the initial se lection of an antidepressant m edication should be based on various factors such as anticipated AEs, the safety or to lerability of these AEs for th e individual patien t, pharmacological properties of the medication, medication response in prior episodes, cost, and pa tient preference. For most patients, an SSRI, an SNRI, mirtazapine, or bupropion is optimal. In general, the use of MAOIs should be restricted to patients who do not respond to other treatments. OCD APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of OCD (APA 2013) The guideline recommends CBT or a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ie, SSRIs or OCD. Choice of treatment moda lity depends on m any factors, including the nature and severity of the patient's symptoms, the nature of any co- occurring psychiatric and medica l conditions and their treat ments, the availability of CBT, and the patient's past treatment history, current medicati ons, and preferences. The guideline notes that all SSR Is appear to be equally effecti ve in treating OCD, even though citalopram and escitalopram are not FDA-approved for this indication. The guideline notes the importanc e, when selecting among the SSRIs, of considering the sa fety and acceptability of particular side effects for a given patient. Par oxetine was not ed to be the SSRI most associated with weight gain. Panic Disorder WFSBP Guidelines for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety D isorders, OCD and PTSD in Primary Care (Bandelow et al 2012 ) In acute panic attacks, reassur ance of the patient may be suffi cient in most cases. In severe attacks, short-acting benzodiazepines may be needed (eg, melting tablets). SSRIs and venlafaxine are the firs t-line treatments for panic disorder. After remission, treatment should continue for at lea st several months in order to prevent relapses. SSRIs, venlafaxine, TCAs, benzodiazepines and other drugs have shown l ong-term efficacy in these studies. APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Panic Disorder (APA 2009) The use of a SSRI, SNRI, TCA, or CBT as the initial treatment f or panic disorder is strongly supported by demonstrated efficacy in numerous RCTs. In the absence of a co- occurring mood disorder, monotherapy with a benzodiazepine is also an appropriate initial treatment. The relatively favorable safety and side-effect profile of SSRI s and SNRIs makes them the best initial pharmacotherapy choice for many patients with panic disorder. A particular form of psychodynamic psychotherapy, panic-focused psychodynamic psychot herapy (PFPP), was effective in 1 RCT and could be offered as an initial treatment . There is insufficient evidence to recommend any of these pharma cological or psychosocial interventions as superior to another, or to routinely recommend a combination of treatmen ts over monotherapy, althoug h a combination may be chosen based on individual circumstances. PMDD American Family Physician - PMS and PMDD (Hofmeister and Bodden 2016 ) SSRIs are first-line tr MDD. Sertraline, paroxetin e, fluoxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram can be used to tr eat the psychiatric symptoms of PMS and PMDD and have been shown to relieve some of the physical symptoms. 297 Data as of October 6, 2017 AS/DKB Page 7 of 11 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. A 2013 Cochrane review analyzed 31 RCTs that compared SSRIs wit h placebo for symptom relief of PMS. Each of the 5 SSRIs studied had statisti cally significant benefits on p atient-reported symptoms w hen taken continuously or only during the luteal phase, but more direct studies comparing luteal phase administration with continuous administration are needed. SNRIs such as venlaf axine have been used off-label to treat PMD D in women with predominantly psychological symptoms. The effect is achieved o ver a relatively short period , 3 to 4 weeks, and sustained throughout subsequent menstrual cycles. PTSD VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guide line for the Management of PTSD (VA/DoD 2017 ) For those patients who choose not to engage in or are unable to access trauma-focused p sychotherapy, the use of venl afaxine as monothera py is recommended based on the results of 3 systematic reviews. Each of these 3 meta-analyses concluded tha t sertraline, paroxetine, fl uoxetine, and venlafaxine each had stronger evidence to supp ort use in the treatment of P TSD compared to the other SSRIs and SNRIs. The benefits of these medications als o outweigh the potential harms . APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Acute Stress Disord er and PTSD (APA 2004, APA 2009 [update]) The 2004 guideline recommended the SSRIs as a first-line medica tion treatment for patients with PTSD. The trials reviewed in the 2009 update sugg est that the SSRIs may no longe r be recommended with the same level of confidence for veterans with co mbat-related PTSD as for patient s with non-combat-related PT SD. Further research is needed to answer why these populat ions have been shown to have differential responses to SSRI treatment. No significant differences am ong antidepressants, including the SSRIs, were found in the few head-to-head studies then available. Social Anxiety Disorder WFSBP Guidelines for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety D isorders, OCD and PTSD in Primary Care (Bandelow et al 2012 ) The guideline recommends SSRIs and venlafaxine for first-line p harmacologic therapy for so cial anxiety disorder. There is insufficient evidence to recommend benzodiazepines or TCAs. Exposure therapy and CBT are also effective psychotherapies. Bulimia Nervosa APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Eating Disorders (APA 2012) In a 2011 systematic r eview for the WFSBP, Aigner et al identified 36 RCTs of medications for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. They r eported that for TCA , Grade A evidence e xists with a moderate risk-benefit ratio. For fluoxetine, Grade A evidence exi sts with a good risk-benefit ra tio, and for topiramate, ther e is Grade A evidence with a moderate risk-benefit ratio. These findings and recommendatio ns were consistent wit h the 2006 APA guideline, which recommends antidepressants , particularly the SSRIs, as on e effective component o f the initial treatment program for most patients with bulimia nervosa. Other pharmaceutical agents, including oxcarbazepine, aripiprazole, and baclofen, have been reported to be effective for bulimia nervosa, but the resu lts were from small case serie s or studies sponsored by the drug manufacturer. Citalopram was studied in a sma ll single-blind 12-week RCT. In this study, 37 patients with bulimia nervosa received fluoxetine (20 to 60 mg/day) or citalopram (20 to 40 mg/day). Both groups improved with respect to eating pathology. Patients receiving fluoxetine reported greater reductions in in trojected anger, whereas those receiving citalopram reported greater reductio n in depressive feelings. SAFETY SUMMARY SSRIs are contraindicated in pati ents receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of their discontinuation. All SSRIs carry a boxed warnin g for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The risk of suicidal thinking and behavior is increased in children, adolesc ents, and young adults taking SSR Is. The use of SSRIs with other serotonergic agent increases the likelihood of serotonergic AEs and should be monitored closely. Drugs that have seroto nergic properties oth ers. Additionally, SSRIs shoul d not be administered with an SNRI or another SSRI as the ri sk for serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrom e is greatly increased. 298 Data as of October 6, 2017 AS/DKB Page 8 of 11 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

According to clinical practice guidelines, CBT and SGAs are equ ally effective first-line mo notherapies in the initial treatment of patients with MDD. T here is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy over another. The effectiveness is generally co mparable between classes a nd within classes of SGAs. Thus, the initial selection of an antidepressant medication sho uld be based on various fact ors such as anticipated AEs, the safety or tolerability of t hese AEs for the individual pati ent, pharmacological pr operties of the medication, medication response in prior episodes, c ost, and patient preference ( APA 2010, Qaseem et al 2016, VA/DoD 2016 ). Some of the SSRIs are also FDA-app roved to treat other psychiatric disorders besides MDD, including panic disorder, OCD, GAD, social anxiety disorder, PTSD, PMDD, and bulimia nerv osa. For these various indications, there are generally no significant differe nces among the SSRIs; however, some products do have a str onger level of evidence or more clinical data available. The SSRIs tend to have similar si de effect profiles; however, c ertain SSRIs may be more lik ely to cause specific side effects. Thus, some patients wh o cannot tolerate 1 SSRI may do well with another. AEs inclu de: drowsiness, insomnia, QTc prolongation, orthostatic hy potension, weight gain, and sex ual dysfunction. All SSRIs carry a boxed warnin g for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, with an increased risk in children, adolescents, and young adults taking SSRIs. The use of SSRIs with other serotone rgic agent increases the lik elihood of serotonergic AEs and should be monitored closely. 300 Data as of October 6, 2017 AS/DKB Page 10 of 11 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Therapeutic Class Overview Respiratory Beta-Agonists INTRODUCTION Respiratory beta 2-agonists are primarily used to treat reversible airway disease. They are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatmen t of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exercise-induced asthma/bronchospasm, and/or reversible bronchospasm. Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing, che st tightness, shortness of br eath, and coughing. Asthma affects people of all ages, but most often starts during chil dhood. In the United States, more than 25 million pe ople are known to have asthma, including about 7 million children . The exact cau se(s) of asthm a are unknown. A combination of factors such as genetics, certain respiratory i nfections during childhood, and contact with airborne aller gens can contribute to its development. Most patients with asthma have allergies (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI] 2014). Current pharmacologic options for asthma management are categor ized as: (1) long-term control medications to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma, and (2) quic k-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms and exacerbations. Long-term control medications for asthma include ( NHLBI 2007 ): Corticosteroids (inhaled corti costeroids [ICSs] for long-term c ontrol; short courses of oral corticosteroids to gain prompt control of disease, long-te rm oral corticosteroids for severe persistent asthma) 2007 ): Anticholinergics (ie, ipratropium bromide), as an alternative b ronchodilator for no t tolerating a short-acting beta 2-agonist (SABA) SABAs (therapy of choice for relief of acute symptoms and preve ntion of exercise-induced bronchospasm) Systemic corticosteroids (not s hort-acting, but used for modera te and severe exacerbations) In recent years, additional medi cations have been made availabl e for select subsets of patie nts with asthma, the interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagoni sts mepolizumab, and reslizumab, (IL-4) antagonist dupilumab, for the m anagement of for for the treatment of asthma ( Spiriva Respimat 2018 ). effe ctive, most commonly recommended long-ter m control medications used for the treatment of asthma. The LABAs should not be us ed as monotherapy for the man agement of asthma due to increased risk for serious adverse events, including death. However, they are effe ctive adjunctive therapy in patients who are not adequately controlled with an ICS alone . Theophylline and mast- cell stabilizers have weak to low efficacy in asthma. Theophylline has an unfav orable side-effect profile and may be life-threatening at high doses. Mast-cell stabilizers have a more favorable safety profile. Tiotropium is an option f or add-on therapy in patients 12 years old with a history of exacerbations. An IL -5 antagonist or the immunoglobu lin E (IgE) antagonist, oma lizumab, may be added if patients require a higher level of care. Omalizumab is used in patients with moderate to sev ere allergic asthma while IL-5 antagonists are used for severe eosinophilic asthma. SABAs are the medication of c hoice for the relief of bronchospasm during acute exacerbations of asthma ( Fasenra prescribing information Initiative for Asthma [GINA] 2018 ). COPD is characterize d by persistent respi ratory symptoms and ai rflow limitation due to a irway and/or alveolar abnormalities. The abnormalities are usually caused by exposure to noxious particles or gase s. Airflow limitation is caused by a combination of small airway disease (eg, obstructiv e bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema); the relative cont ributions of each component vary between patients. The most common symptoms of COPD include dyspnea, cough, and sputum production ( Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] 2019 ). 303 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/CK-U/ALS Page 2 of 12 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. COPD affects 6.4% of the United States (U.S.) population and is the major contributor to mor tality from chronic lower respiratory diseases, the third leading cause of death in the U .S. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017 ). Globally, COPD is the fourth leadi ng cause of death and is expected to be the third leadi ng cause of death by 2020; the burden of COPD continues to increase due to continued expos ure to risk factors and aging of the population (GOLD 2019 ). Cigarette smoking is the main r isk factor for COPD; other risk factors include biomass f uel exposure (such as from cooking and heating in poorly v entilated dwellings) and air pol lution. Host factors such as genetic abnormalities, abnormal lung developmen t, and accelerated aging can predispose individuals to COPD development (GOLD 2019 ). Patients with COPD may experience exacerbations, which are peri ods of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms (GOLD 2019 ). Pharmacologic therapy for COPD can reduce symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve patients' health status and exercise tolerance. There i s no conclusive evidence that COPD medications modify the long-term decline in l ung function characteristics o f COPD ( GOLD 2019 ). Pharmacologic options for COPD treatment several class es, including beta 2-agonists, anticholinergics, methylxanthines, ICSs, various combination (PDE)-4 i nhibitor, roflumilast. Pharmacologic treatments should be individualized based on symptom severity, risk of exacerbations, side effects, comorbidities, drug availability, and cost, as well as the pati ent's response, prefe rence, and ability to use various drug delivery devices (GOLD 2019). Inhaled bronchodilators are centra l to COPD symptom management, and are usually given on a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms. Sever al long-acting inhaled broncho dilators are available, and use of short-acting bronchodilators on a regular basis is not generally recommended (GOLD 2019). Beta 2-agonists differ in their dosing requirements, pharmacokinetic parameters, and potential adverse effects. Several of the SABAs are available generic ally in at least 1 strength o r formulation; however, there are no generic formulations for the LABAs. This review includes the sing le-agent inhaled and oral beta 2-agonists. Although several agent s are also available in combination inhalers along with an ICS or an anticholinergic, the combination produ cts are not included in this review. Tables in this review are organi zed by whether the drug product is short- or long-acting. Note that extended-release albuterol is categorized as shor t-acting for the purposes of th is review, along with the other albuterol products.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Clinical trials have demonstrat ed the efficacy of SABAs and LAB As in providing relief from a sthma exacerbations, COPD exacerbations and exercise -induced asthma (EIA). SABAs: Asthma and COPD In the clinical trials that evaluated SABAs for the treatment of mild asthma, all SABAs have been shown to be efficacious in improving forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1). In the clinical trials that c ompared albuterol to levalbuterol, inconsistent results were found ( Carl et al 2003, Gawchik et al 1999, Milgro m et al 2001, Nelson et al 1998, Nowak et al 2004, Nowak et al 2006, Qureshi et al 2005, Schreck et al 2005, Sepracor Trial 1, Sepracor Trial 2, Skoner et al 2001 ). In 2 studies (1 retrospective, 1 prospective), levalbuterol res ulted in a significantly lower hospitalization rate compared to albuterol ( Carl et al 2003, Schreck et al 2005 ). In another trial, when the 2 agents were given in the emergency department, there was no significant difference in the time to discharge ( Skoner et al 2001 ). Nowak et al also reported that there was no difference in the time to disc harge from the emergency room with albuterol compared to levalbuter ol (76 and 78.5 minutes; p = 0. 74) (Nowak et al 2006 ). 305 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/CK-U/ALS Page 4 of 12 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Overall, studies have shown no si gnificant differences between the 2 agents in the peak change in FEV 1 and the number and incidence of adverse events experienced ( Carl et al 2003, Gawchik et al 1999, Milgrom et al 2001, Nelson et al 1998, Nowak et al 2004, Nowak et al 2006, Qu reshi et al 2005, Schreck et al 2005, Sepracor Trial 1, Sepracor Trial 2, Skoner et al 2001 ). In an unpublished study, the difference in peak FEV 1 was statistically significant fo r albuterol hydro fluoroalkanes Albuterol dry powder inhaler was compared to placebo dry powder inhaler in patients with asthma maintained on ICS treatment ( Raphael et al 2014 ). Patients treated with albuter ol dry powder inhaler had signi ficantly improved FEV 1 area under the curve compared to place bo. In patients with exercise- induced bronchoc onstriction undergoing treadmill exercise challenge, placebo-treated patients had a greater decr ease in FEV 1 compared with albut erol dry powder inhaler-treated patients Ostrom In a cumulative-dose, crossover albuterol dry powder inhaler was compared with albuterol HFA with similar between -group improvements in FEV 1 at 30 minutes ( Miller et al 2014 ). Additionally, albuterol dry power inhaler demonstrated favorabl e FEV 1 improvement in EIA co mpared to placebo in a crossover study (Ostrom et al 2015 ). LABAs: Asthma The LABAs salmeterol and formoter ol have been found to improve FEV 1 in patients with mild to moderate asthma who require persistent use of SABAs. H owever, the SMART trial found that salmeterol had significant occurrences of combined respiratory-related deat hs or respiratory-related life-threatening experiences compa red to placebo (p < 0.05) (Nelson et al 2006 ). In a meta-analysis, salmetero l and formoterol both demonstra ted an exacerbations that required hospi talization, life-threatening exacerbations and asthma-related deaths in adults and children alike when compared to placebo ( Salpeter et al 2006). Due to the results of thes e studies, all LABAs have a boxed warning stating that these agents may increase the risk o f asthma-related death. LABAs: COPD A systematic review concluded t hat in patients with COPD, there was no difference in the rate of mild exacerbations between patients treated with an ICS or LABA (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0 .49 to 5.39) or in the rate of moderate or severe COPD exace rbations (rate ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.02) ( Spencer et al 2011 ). The safety and efficacy of indaca terol were evaluated in randomized controlled trials tha t compared it to placebo and other agents used in the management of COPD ( Balint et al 2010, Buhl et al 2011, Chapman et al 2011, Dahl et al 2010, Donohue et al 2010, Feldman et al 2010, Korn et al 2011, Kornmann et al 2011, Magnussen et al 2010, Vogelmeier et al 2010 ). Notably, most of these trials e valuated indacaterol in doses of 150, 300 and 600 mcg once daily, rather than the FDA-approved dosing of 75 mcg once daily ( Balint et al 2010, Buhl et al 2011, Chapman et al 2011, Dahl et al 2010, Donohue et al 2010, Feldman et al 2010, Korn et al 2011, Kornmann et al 2011, Magnussen et al 2010, Vogelmeier et al 2010 ). However, results from placebo -controlled trials of indacater ol 75 mcg have also been published, lending support to the use of the 75 mcg dose ( Gotfried et al 2012, Kerwin et al 2011 ). Overall, data from published clin ical trials demonstrated that treatment with indacaterol consistently results in significantly higher mean trough FEV 1 after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo, formoterol, s almeterol and tiotropium. Patients treated with indacaterol also achieved sig nificant improvements in COPD symptoms, as well as health-related quality of life compared to those treated with p lacebo. Compared to placebo, i ndacaterol significantly reduces the use of rescue medications, increases the days of no rescue medication use, and improves diary card- derived symptom variables (eg, nights with no awakenings, days with no daytime symptoms, days able to perform usual activities). In general, treatment with indacaterol is favored over other long-acting bronchodilators for these outcomes, but statistical superiority i s not consistently achieved ( Balint et al 2010, Buhl et al 2011, Chapman et al 2011, Dahl et al 2010, Donohue et al 2010, Feldman et al 2010, Gotfried et al 2012, Kerwin et al 2011, Korn et al 2011, Kornmann et al 2011, Magnussen et al 2010, Vogelmeier et al 2010 ). Recent meta-analyses or formoterol) demonstrated that patients treated with indacaterol had higher trough FEV 1 and greater improvements in the us e of rescue medications and achieving improvements in dyspnea and health status compared to the alternative treat ments. However, the trials inc luded in this meta-analysis used indacaterol doses higher than FDA-approved daily doses of 75 mcg ( Cope et al 2013, Rodrigo et al 2012 ). Placebo-controlled trials demon strate that within 5 minutes aft er administration of indacater ol, significant improvements in bronchodilation are achieved ( Balint et al 2010, Donohue et al 2010, Gotfr ied et al 2012, Kerwin et al 2011, 306 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/CK-U/ALS Page 5 of 12 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

These results have also been observed when comparing indacat erol to salmeterol, salmeterol/fluticasone, and tiotropium ( Buhl et al 2011, Korn et al 2011, Vogelmeier et al 2010 ). In 2 studies, patients diagnosed with COPD were treated with ar formoterol, salmeterol, or placebo. These studies found that both arformoterol and salmeterol significantly improved morning trough FEV 1 throughout the 12 weeks of daily treatment compared to placebo ( p < 0.001 in both trials) ( Baumgartner et al 2007, Sepracor, 2005 ). In a head-to-head study against salmeterol, formoter ol was associate d with a grea ter change from baseline in FEV 1 at 5 minutes post-dose on day 28 (p = 0.022) ( Cote et al 2009 ). Currently, there is a lack of head-to-head randomized, doubl e-blind clinical trials to determine a preferential status of one agent over another fo r the treatment of COPD. Two replicate, multicenter, r andomized, double-blind, placebo-c ontrolled, parallel-group, Phase 3 studies investigated the and safety of once-daily olodaterol via Respimat soft-mist inhaler vs placebo and formoterol over 48 weeks in patients with moderate to very severe COPD receiving usual-care background therapy. Patients were randomized to receive olodaterol 5 or placebo. Co-primary endpoints were FEV 1 area under the curve from 0 to 3 hours (AUC 0-3), trough FEV 1, and Mahler transition dyspnea index (TDI) total score after 24 weeks. Overall, in Study 1222. 13 (N = 904) and Study 1222.14 (N = 934), patients who received treatment with olodater ol had significantly improved F EV1 AUC 0-3 vs placebo in both studies (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons) and trough FEV 1 vs placebo (p < 0.01). Formoter ol also showed statistically si gnificant differences in both Study 1222.13 (p < 0.01) and Study 1222.14 (p < 0.05) ( Koch et al 2014 ). Two replicate, randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, pa rallel-group, Phase 3 trials investigated the long-term safety and efficacy of olodatero l in patients with moderate to very severe COPD receivi ng usual-care background mcg or 10 mcg or placebo once daily for 48 weeks. C o-primary endpoints were FEV 1 AUC 0-3 (change from baseline) and trough FEV 1 at 12 weeks. Overall, Study 1222.11 (N = 624) and Study 1222.1 2 (N = 642) showed that olodatero l 5 mcg and 10 mcg significantly improved the FEV 1 AUC 0-3 response (p < 0.0001) and trough FEV 1 (Study 1222.11, p < 0.0001; Study 1222.12, p < 0.05, post hoc) at week 12. The incidence of adverse events was comparable with that of placebo ( Ferguson et al 2014 ). Two replicate, multicenter, r andomized, double-blind, double-du mmy, placebo-controlled, 4-way cross-over group, Phase 3 studies investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of once-daily olodaterol via Respimat soft-mist inhaler vs placebo and formoterol over 6 weeks in patients with moderate t o very severe COPD receiving usual-care background therapy. Patients were randomized to receive once-daily olodate rol 5 or 10 mcg, or placebo. Co-primary endpoints were FEV 1 area under the curve fr om 0 to 12 hours (AUC 0-12) and FEV 1 area under the curve from 12 to 24 hours (AUC 12-24) after 6 weeks. Overall, in St udy 1222.24 (N = 99) and Study 1 222.25 (N = 100), patients who received treatmen t with both doses of olodaterol a nd formoterol had significantly improved endpoint [FEV 1 AUC 0-24]) vs placebo in both studies (for all comparisons p < 0.0 001). No statistically significant differences were reported between the 3 active comparators ( Feldman et al 2014 ). A meta-analysis that L ABAs (salmeterol, formoterol, an d indacaterol) to tiotropium demonstrated that tiotropium was more effective than LABAs as a group in preventing COPD exacerbations and disease-related hospitalizations. However, overall hospitalization rates, morta lity, symptom improvement, and changes in lung function were similar among groups ( Chong et al 2012 ). Another meta-analysis compare d the use of LABAs plus tiotrop ium to the use of either LABAs alone or tiotropium alone. The analysis demonstrated that there was a significant improvement in FEV 1 with combination therapy compared to tiotropium alone. There w as also a small mean improvement in health- related quality of life for patients receiving a LABA plus tiot ropium compared to tiotropi um alone, but the clinical significance of this small differ ence is unclear. Hospital admi ssions and mortality were not s ignificantly different between groups. Data compari ng LABA plus tiotropium to LABA alone were somewhat limited, but dem onstrated a significant improvement in health-related quality of life, FEV 1 and exacerbations ( Farne et al 2015 ). EIA For the treatment of EIA, albuterol, metaproterenol, and formot erol have demonstrated an improvement in FEV 1 compared to placebo ( Berkowitz et al 1986, Bonini et al 2013, Edelm an et al 2000, Richter et al 2002, Shapiro et al 2002, Storms et al 2004 ). In 1 study, albuterol- and met aproterenol-treated patients had a lower incidence of exercise-induced bronchospasm compared to placebo ( Cote et al 2009 ). 307 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/CK-U/ALS Page 6 of 12 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In another study comparing albut erol, formoterol and placebo fo r EIA, both active treatment groups provided a statistically significant decrease in mean maximum percent of F EV1 compared to placebo (p < 0.01) ( Shapiro et al 2002 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Asthma The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) gu ideline from the NHLBI s tates that the initial treatment of asthma should correspond to the appropriate asthma severity category, and it provides a stepwise approach to asthma management. Long -term control medications su as ICSs, and immunomodulators should be taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent a sthma. ICSs are the most potent and consistently effective long-term asthma control medication. Quick-relief medica tions such as SABAs and anticholinergics are used to p rovide prompt relief of bronchoconstriction and accompany ing acute symptoms such as cou gh, chest tightness, and wheezing. Systemic corticosteroids are important in the treatment of moderate or severe exacerbations because these medications prevent progression of the exacerbation , speed recovery, and prevent re lapses ( NHLBI 2007 ). LABAs are used in combination wi th ICSs for long-term control a nd prevention of symptoms in moderate or severe persistent asthma. Of the adjunctive treat ments available, a L ABA is the preferred option to combine with an IC S in patients 12 years of age and older. This combination is also an option in selected p atients 5 to 12 years of age. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guideline also provides a stepwise approach to asthma management. It recommends an ICS as a preferred controller medication choice, with an increased ICS dose and/or addition of a LABA for increasing symptom severity (higher steps). At the highest step, it is recommended that the patient be referred for add-on 2018 GOLD guidelines state that the management strategy for stable COPD should be p redominantly based on an assessment of the patient's sympt oms and future risk of exacerbations. The risk of exacerbati ons is now based solely on the exacerbation history, wherea s in previous versions of the g uideline, risk assessment als o included consideration of airflow limitation assessed by s pirometry. Key recommendations from the GOLD guidelines are as follows ( GOLD 2019 ): Inhaled bronchodilators are reco mmended over bronchodilators. LAMAs and LABAs are preferred over short-acti ng agents except for patients with onl y occasional dyspnea. Patients may be started on single long-acting bronchodilator th erapy or dual long-acting bronchodilator therapy. In patients with persistent dyspn ea on 1 bronchodilator, treatment should be escalated to 2. Long-term monotherapy with ICSs is not recommended. Long-term t reatment with ICSs may be considered in association with LABAs for patient s with a history of exacerbat ions despite treatment with long-acting bronchodilators. Treatment recommendations are given for patients with COPD based on their GOLD patient group (see Table 3 below). Group A: Patients should be offered bronchodilator treatment (s hort- or long-acting), based on its effect on breathlessness. This should be co ntinued if symptomatic benefit is documented. Group B: Initial therapy should consist of a long- acting bronch odilator (LAMA or LABA). For p atients with persistent on monotherapy, use of 2 bronchodilators is reco mmended (LAMA + LABA). F or patients with severe breathlessness, initial therapy with 2 bronchodilators m ay be considered. If t he addition of a second bronchodilator does not improve symptoms, it is suggested that treatment could be stepped down to a single bronchodilator; switching to anot her device or molecules can al so be considered. Group C: Initial therapy should be a LAMA. Patients with persis tent exacerbations may benefit from adding a second long-acting bronchodilator (LAMA + LABA, preferred) or using an ICS + LABA. For patients who have a history and/or findings suggestive of asthma-COPD overlap or bl ood eosinophil count 300 cells/\u00b5L, ICS + LABA is preferred. Group D: In general, it is recomm ended to start therapy with a LAMA. For patients with more severe symptoms, especially dyspnea and/or exercise limitation, LAMA/LABA may be considered for initial treatment. In some patients, initial therapy with an ICS + LABA may be the first c hoice; these patients ma y have a history and/or findings suggestive of asthma-COPD overlap or blood eosinophil count 300 cells/\u00b5L. In patients who develop further exacerbations on LAMA + LABA therapy, alternative pathw ays include escalation to a LAMA + LABA + ICS 308 Data as of November 19, 2018 KS-U/CK-U/ALS Page 7 of 12 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

If patients treated w ith a LAMA + LABA + ICS still have exacerbations, options for selected patients may include addition of roflumilast, addition of a macrolide , or stopping the ICS. Table 3.

The guidelines state that certain combination bronchodilators or bronchodilator/ICS combinations may reduce exacerbations, but does not state that any combination is super ior to LAMA monotherapy in pat ients with stable COPD riction, guidelines from the American Thoracic Society recommend administration of an inhaled SABA 15 minutes prior to e xercise. The guidelines al so recommend a controller agent added whenever SABA therapy is used at least o nce daily. Additional guidelines are set forth for patients wi th symptoms despite using an inhaled SABA before exercise ( Parsons et al 2013 ). Joint guidelines from the Amer ican Academy of Allergy, Asthm a & Immunology, the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunolog y, and the American Colle ge of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology state that beta 2-agonists (SABAs or L ABAs) are most effectiv e at short-term pro tection against exercise- induced bronchoconstriction and for accelerating recovery from exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. However, daily use of a SABA or LABA will lead to tolerance. Additional or adj unctive options include daily u se of leukotriene inhibitors or ICSs, cromolyn sodium before exercise, or ipratropium for pa tients who have not responded to other agents ( Weiler et al 2016 ). SAFETY ProAir RespiC with a severe hyperse nsitivity to milk proteins. LABAs should generally not be used as a prim ary treatment of st atus asthmaticus or other a cute episodes of asthma or COPD that require intensive measures; this is listed as a co ntraindication for Serevent Diskus. All LABAs are contraindicated for use in patients with asthma without concomitant use of a long-term asthma control medication. Key warnings and precautions: All LABAs have a boxed warning describing the increased risk of asthma-related deaths. Bec ause of this risk, use of LABAs for the treatment of asthma without a concomitant long-term asthma control medication, such as an ICS, is contraindicated. LABAs should be used only as additional therap y for patients with asthm a who are currently taking but are inadequately controlled on a long-term asthma control m edication, such as an ICS. Beta 2-agonists may also lead to: paradoxical bronchospasm fatalities with excessive use cardiovascular effects such as increased heart rate, blood pres sure, and/or electrocardiogram changes central nervous system effects and/or seizures LABAs should not be used to treat a cute symptoms or initiated i n the setting of acutely deteriorating asthma or COPD.

CONCLUSION Single-entity respiratory beta 2-agonist agents are FDA-approve d for the treatment of asthma, C OPD, reversible airway obstruction and/or exercise-induced bronchospasm. Beta 2-agonists are classified as short- or long-acting based on thei r onset and duration of actio n, and are available in various dosage forms, including solution for nebulization, aero sol inhaler, dry powder inhaler, oral solution, extended-release tablets, solution for injec tion. SABAs are generally dosed multipl e times per day for the treatm ent or prevention of symptoms. LABAs are typically administered twice daily for COPD, with the exception of indacaterol and olodaterol, which are administered once daily. Overall, SABAs have demonstrated similar efficacy and safety. S imilarly, guidelines do not recommend one LABA over another, and head-to-head clinical trials have not determined t he superiority of any one agent. All LABAs have a boxed warning stating that these agents may in crease the risk of ast hma-related death. In the treatment of ast hma, LABAs should not be used as monothe rapy, but rather added on to another long-acting controller medication such as an ICS if patients are not adequa tely controlled on the ICS alone. GINA and NHLBI guidelines recom mend SABAs for symptomatic relie f in patients with asthma, which should generally be used on an as-needed or \"rescue \" basis. For chronic manageme nt of asthma, LABAs shou ld be used as add-on therapy in patients not adequatel y controlled on an ICS as an a lternative to maximizing the ICS dose. LABAs may also be used for exerci se-induced bronchospasm and provide a longer period of coverage (typically 12 hours or more) compared to the SABAs; however, daily use of a b eta 2-agonist can lead to tolerance, and daily use of LABA monotherapy is not recommended. GOLD guidelines state that inhaled bronchodilators are a key co mponent of COPD treatment, and long-acting agents are generally preferred over sho rt-acting agents for maintenanc e therapy. Depending on the COPD patient s ubtype, initial COPD management may include use of a beta 2-agonist and/or an anticholinergic agent. None of the current asthma or COPD treatment guidelines recomme nd the use of one specific inhaled beta 2-agonist product over another. Administration instructions and inhalation devices vary among products and should be considered in product selection.
