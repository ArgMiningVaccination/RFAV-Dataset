Homeopathy is a sophisticated method of natural health care that works by harnessing our body's natural defenses, the most powerful medicinal tool we have at our disposal. It focuses on bringing the entire body back into balance, treating the patient as a whole by differentiating those symptoms which are peculiar or characteristics to the individual, instead of diagnosing and prescribing on the basis of the common expression of symptoms of a particular disorder. The homeopathic understanding of a disease is that nothing happens chaotically; a person produces symptoms because something is wrong. And the body produces these symptoms in a very specific order; they are thus all related to each other, expressions of a common imbalance in the system that shows itself at different parts of life through various disorders. How one person expresses symptoms is different than another person's expression. It is the homeopath's job to find the uniqueness of the individual and prescribe on the uniqueness. Therefore, unlike traditional medicine, which focuses on the symptoms, Homeopathy treats the entire person. Conventional medicine has its place in health therapy when there is irreversible structural damage or when the manifestation of the disease has compromised an individual's health to the extent that the vital force is no longer capable of stimulating a viable curative response. But conventional medicine does not correct inherited or acquired imbalances of the autoimmune system, which, when functioning properly, protects an individual from chronic and acute diseases. By giving the patient medicines created to suppress the disease's outcome rather than its cause, conventional medicine can actually weaken our natural defense mechanism. All You Need To Know About Homeopathy - What Is the Difference Between Homeopathy and Naturopathy? [Naturopathic medicine](https://wholehealthnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-medicine/)is an umbrella term that integrates various natural health care methods, including homeopathy, nutrition, Chinese Medicine, botanical medicine, hydrotherapy, lifestyle management, etc. Some naturopathic doctors are general practitioners, incorporating many different natural health care approaches to a lesser or greater extent. Others specialize in one or more methods, devoting all their time to refining and perfecting their knowledge in one modality. Like Chinese Medicine, homeopathic medicine is a whole method of health care unto itself, with its own history and tradition, and its own definition of what is health, disease, and healing. It takes a lifetime of dedicated study and practice to become excellent and most effective in homeopathic medicine. - How Does Homeopathy Work? Even though Homeopathy has been in use for more than 2000 years, it was only developed as a systematic and scientific therapy of medical treatment in 1796 by the German physician Dr. Samuel Hahnemann having become disenchanted by conventional medical practices. Dr. Hahnemann observed that substances which produce symptoms in healthy people, cure similar symptoms in the sick, thus describing the \"Law of Similars\". Homeopathy works based on the principle \"like cures like.\" Thus, a substance capable of producing morbid symptoms in a healthy person can cure similar symptoms in an individual whose health has been unbalanced. By matching the individualizing symptoms within a patient to those related to a particular homeopathic substance, a homeopathic remedy stimulates the autoimmune system in order to eradicate the underlying cause of the imbalance, thus restoring health and equilibrium. A consultation with a homeopath aims to stimulate your body to heal itself. In fact, symptoms are expressions of how our body reacts to stress, be physical (a virus, for example) or emotional (loss of a job or a loved one). From your description of all your different symptoms, even if they seem totally unrelated to you, the homeopath can discern the nature of your vital force. - What Conditions Are Treated by a Homeopath? Homeopathy is about treating the whole person, any person, and not just the condition. Thus, anyone can come and see a homeopath, from any age group, or with any condition. From the foundation of homeopathy, there is only one disease per person. And this disease has been there for a while; it is called a constitutional disease. If you are only treating the symptoms, you are continually chasing the disease. But once your practitioner has identified the root cause of the disease, and has treated it, then not only you get rid of what is happening now, you also eliminate all that has been happening in the past, as well as things that will happen in the future. You may still experience stress, but how you handle that stress will be in a more healthy manner. So Homeopathy is prevention, it is a cure for today, but also helps you deal with what will stress you in the future. As, unfortunately, stressors on our body are inevitable. - What Types of Remedies Are Used in Homeopathy? Homeopathic remedies are made from many things that exists on earth, including plants, minerals, metals, or animals. There are over 3000 homeopathic medicines to choose from; when used correctly, homeopathic medicines can help you heal yourself, with no harmful side-effects. - Is There Any Risk to Homeopathy? Homeopathic remedies are non-toxic and devoid of any side-effects. The very nature of homeopathic remedies is integrated, working harmoniously and directly on the vital force instead of merely on the physiological body. Consequently, they are safe, gentle, and efficacious. Homeopathy has been designed to analyze each case individually and suggest the most appropriate remedy and dosage based on an individual's particular symptoms, instead of by the name of a disease or disorder. Even though you cannot have a side effect reaction to a homeopathic remedy, you can have a strong reaction to it, which can be seen as a healing crisis. As a matter of fact, healing means that your body is trying to correct itself. By taking a homeopathic remedy, you are trying to help it achieve this, giving it a substance that mimics your symptoms better. For a day or two, those symptoms might get worse, but after this healing crisis you will be feeling much better. Some conventional drugs may interfere with the curative power of the homeopathic medicines; yet there is no possibility of a homeopathic medicine interfering with the action of a conventional drug. The necessity for conventional medicines is sometimes reduced or even eliminated as a result of the homeopathic treatment. In many instances, a homeopathic remedy will be able to augment or speed up the recovery process. In most situations, the action of a homeopathic medicine eliminates the need for conventional drugs because the homeopathic medicines are able to work quickly, thoroughly, and without any side effects. - How Can I Make the Most Out of My Homeopathic Care? Homeopathic medicine is not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle. On the contrary, homeopathy works best in conjunction with balanced eating and exercise habits. Nonetheless, improved health through homeopathy often results in greater vitality and awareness, enhancing motivation towards a better lifestyle. Your guidance is essential in helping your homeopath help you. Remember, your life story and how your experience the world is important to understanding your unique coping style. It holds the key to understanding how your disease evolved, shedding light on the profound mystery of how your natural defenses work. Are you interested in learning how homeopathy may help you?
