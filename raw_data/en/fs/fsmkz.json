This pilot study investigated vaccine decision making, i.e., the relationships between knowledge and attitudes towards autism spectrum disorders (ASD), scientific literacy, attitudes toward the (MMR) vaccine, and children's MMR vaccination status. Methods. A sample of 132 parents and expectant parents (mean age 38.40 years; >60% with university education) participated in a survey where they were asked about their knowledge of ASD, attitudes towards ASD and MMR, and their children's MMR vaccine status. The participants also completed a standardized science test (The American College Test) to test their scientific literacy. Results. Knowledge of ASD was positively correlated with attitudes towards ASD. Attitudes towards ASD were positively correlated with scientific literacy and attitudes towards MMR. Attitudes towards MMR were positively correlated with MMR vaccine status (i.e., vaccination decision). Discussion. Factors other than scientific literacy seem to contribute towards children's MMR vaccine status such as attitudes towards MMR. However, these are preliminary findings and need to be interpreted with caution.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-04-08", "cleaned_text": "To Vaccinate or Not: The Relative Impact of Attitudes toward Autism Spectrum Disorders and the Ability to Interpret Scientific Information on Vaccination Decisions [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072542](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072542) [Health Behaviors, Risk [1](#B1-ijerph-17-02542)]. The disorder is characterized by persistent and pervasive deficits in social communication and social interactions across multiple situations. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity are particularly evident in young children [ [2](#B2-ijerph-17-02542)]. These characteristic symptoms typically present within the first two years of a child's life [ [3](#B3-ijerph-17-02542)], a developmental period which coincides directly with the peak time for administration of childhood vaccinations [ [4](#B4-ijerph-17-02542)]. It is estimated that ASD currently affects 1 in every 160 individuals in the world today [ [5](#B5-ijerph-17-02542)]. [6](#B6-ijerph-17-02542)]. Public knowledge and understanding of ASD compared with other childhood disorders is considered to be poor [ [7](#B7-ijerph-17-02542), [8](#B8-ijerph-17-02542)] showing multiple misconceptions and a general lack of understanding and awareness of ASD [ [9](#B9-ijerph-17-02542)]. Nonetheless, research aimed at investigating societal attitudes toward ASD is lacking [ [10](#B10-ijerph-17-02542)], which is important, given the false proposition that ASD may be caused by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Thus, there is a need to examine the potential link between attitudes towards ASD and vaccines, especially the MMR vaccine, due to the erroneous claim that the MMR vaccine could be linked to children developing ASD. [11](#B11-ijerph-17-02542)]. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield et al. asserted a link between the MMR vaccine and the development of ASD in young children, thus suggesting a causative explanation for ASD [ [12](#B12-ijerph-17-02542)]. Due to the ensuing lack of any evidence supporting a causal connection between the MMR vaccine and ASD, the Lancet officially retracted the article in January 2010. Despite flawed research methodology and a substantial and undisclosed conflict of interest on the part of Andrew Wakefield, media coverage concerning the autism-vaccine link significantly impacted public awareness [ [13](#B13-ijerph-17-02542)]. The impact of media reports on public understanding is considerable considering that a substantial proportion of mothers attributed their knowledge of adverse vaccine side effects to media sources such as television [ [14](#B14-ijerph-17-02542)]. [11](#B11-ijerph-17-02542), [15](#B15-ijerph-17-02542)]. Factors found to strongly influence parental decisions related to MMR vaccination include knowledge of diseases and of the MMR vaccine [ [16](#B16-ijerph-17-02542)], general concerns about vaccine safety [ [17](#B17-ijerph-17-02542)], and being a parent of a child diagnosed with ASD [ [18](#B18-ijerph-17-02542)]. In particular, perception concerning the risk of ASD following vaccination with MMR has been found to directly impact attitudes towards the vaccine [ [16](#B16-ijerph-17-02542)]. [19](#B19-ijerph-17-02542)] offers a potential explanation concerning cultural beliefs that polarize anti-vaccination and pro-vaccination groups [ [20](#B20-ijerph-17-02542)]. The theory presumes there is a psychological predisposition for: (1) individuals to uphold beliefs that fit with personal worldviews [ [20](#B20-ijerph-17-02542)]; and (2) for group membership to be divided according to consensual risk perceptions [ [21](#B21-ijerph-17-02542)]. Inherent in this theory is that culture comes before facts, subsequently shaping attitudes and consequent behavior. Thus, despite exposure to scientific information about the safety of vaccines, personal disagreement with the information being imparted by researchers continues [ [22](#B22-ijerph-17-02542)]. [23](#B23-ijerph-17-02542)]. Research by Allchin [ [24](#B24-ijerph-17-02542)] emphasized that having an understanding about the nature of science provides individuals with fundamental skills necessary to identify credible sources of scientific findings, to understand value judgments applied to scientific findings, and to discern inaccurate information. [25](#B25-ijerph-17-02542)] demonstrated that providing parents with evidence-based and up-to-date information about MMR vaccines\u2014thereby improving scientific literacy\u2014significantly improved their attitudes to the vaccine. Despite this, scientific facts alone may not be sufficient to modify perceptions of risk attributed to non-evidence-based theories [ [26](#B26-ijerph-17-02542)]; greater knowledge does not always equate with unambiguous acceptance [ [27](#B27-ijerph-17-02542)]. Furthermore, as the Cultural Theory of Risk suggests, people are generally primarily interested in accessing information that supports their own personal views rather than contradictory information, even that which has a sound scientific basis. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants [28](#B28-ijerph-17-02542)]. 2.2. Measures [29](#B29-ijerph-17-02542)] is a 16-item scale recently developed to measure both explicit and implicit societal attitudes to ASD. Scores range from 16 to 64, with higher scores indicative of favorable attitudes. The SATA has demonstrated good construct validity and internal consistency. Importantly, the scale can discriminate between groups based on level of knowledge about ASD [ [29](#B29-ijerph-17-02542)]. [30](#B30-ijerph-17-02542), [31](#B31-ijerph-17-02542)] is a 20-item scale used to assess individual knowledge concerning ASD. The scale was originally developed by Stone [ [32](#B32-ijerph-17-02542)]. The original version has demonstrated internal consistency and stability over time [ [33](#B33-ijerph-17-02542)]. Scores range from 20 to 120, with higher scores indicative of greater knowledge. [34](#B34-ijerph-17-02542)] is a 19-item scale developed to measure attitudes regarding decisions related to immunization with the MMR vaccine. Scores range from 19 to 76, with higher scores indicative of more favorable attitudes toward the MMR vaccine. The scale has demonstrated acceptable levels of internal consistency and test-retest reliability. 2.3. Procedure 2.4. Statistical Analysis 3. Results [Table 1](#ijerph-17-02542-t001)shows the correlation between the key outcome variables. There was a strong correlation between attitudes towards MMR and MMR vaccine status. Knowledge of ASD was strongly and positively correlated with attitudes towards ASD, and scientific literacy had a strong positive correlation with attitudes towards ASD. There were only weak correlations between attitudes towards ASD and attitudes towards MMR, and scientific literacy had a low correlation with attitudes towards the MMR vaccine. [Table 2](#ijerph-17-02542-t002). Participants that were positive towards the MMR vaccine were more likely to have sought information from a GP than their counterparts that were negative towards the MMR vaccine, while the latter were more likely to have sought information from friends and web sites. [Table 3](#ijerph-17-02542-t003)). The full list of answers is available in the de-identified data file via an open access data depository [ [28](#B28-ijerph-17-02542)]. 4. Discussion [Table 1](#ijerph-17-02542-t001)), it could be considered that respondents had a high level of knowledge of ASD in general, contradicting the findings by Holt and Christensen [ [9](#B9-ijerph-17-02542)] that suggested that most people have a general lack of understanding concerning ASD. This finding may be explained by how participants were recruited, that is, coming from Facebook groups that were anti- and pro-vaccine, thus potentially more knowledgeable about aspects of ASD than the general public. [16](#B16-ijerph-17-02542)] who identified that fears related to the unfounded link between ASD and MMR vaccine were subsiding. Whilst their study did not specifically assess attitudes to ASD, they did acknowledge the influence of overall parental attitudes on vaccination decisions. [11](#B11-ijerph-17-02542)]. As such, the current study suggests that attitudes to the MMR vaccine, regardless of negative or positive attitudes to ASD, are associated with the vaccination or non-vaccination of children. The probability of this assumption is further strengthened considering that no questions on the MMR Survey relate specifically to ASD. Whilst \"risks\" (e.g., concerned about the ingredients and unsure of safety of vaccines) associated with MMR were predominant reasons given for non-vaccination of children, as aforementioned, only one of the 21 parents who had a negative MMR vaccine status (not going to immunize) voiced concerns related specifically to ASD. [35](#B35-ijerph-17-02542)]. [Table 1](#ijerph-17-02542-t001)). Level of scientific literacy was not significantly related to vaccination behavior. This may be due to the limited number of participants that completed the scientific literacy test. It also may be that it is not scientific literacy that influences vaccination decisions, but rather motivated reasoning, given the different sources of information the two MMR vaccine status groups had (see [Table 2](#ijerph-17-02542-t002)). The majority of the \"no\" group relies on the websites option while the majority of the \"yes\" group relies on GPs and other actual medical professionals. It seems as if the \"no\" group is searching for confirmation to confirm their beliefs rather than trusting health care professionals. [20](#B20-ijerph-17-02542)]. Limitations 5.
