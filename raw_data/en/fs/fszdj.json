One of the ways that sleep apnea symptoms can be eased is with essential oils. But what oils should you recommend your patients, and how can they help with sleep apnea? Plus, should you recommend natural remedies at your dental office? Keep reading to get your answers so you can remain informed while helping your patients get better, more restful sleep. First, What Exactly Are Essential Oils? Essential oils are already known for a variety of health benefits, but they can also be used to treat sleep conditions, including sleep apnea. An all-natural remedy, essential oils are concentrated compounds that are extracted from plants. They retain the plant's flavor and scent, used mostly for aromatherapy. Essential oils can be inhaled, diluted, or used topically - some are even safe to ingest. When the chemical compounds interact with the body, they can provide many advantages, including better, deeper, and more restful sleep. The Best Essential Oils for Sleep Apnea There are so many essential oils that offer a wide range of advantages. However, these are some of the best ones you can recommend for those with sleep apnea: - Lavender: This popular oil helps those with sleep apnea relax and feel calm. Tell your patients to apply it to their pillow, chest, neck, or feet. They can also diffuse it in the bedroom - some prefer this method over others. - Peppermint: Perfect for sleep apnea, peppermint clears nasal passages and congestion. Plus, it can ease headaches that may contribute to sleep interruptions. - Marjoram: It has soothing properties that promote better sleep. This oil can be diluted in a carrier oil or applied to the feet, wrists, and chest. - Eucalyptus: This anti-inflammatory clears away mucus and opens the airways - exactly what sleep apnea patients need to enjoy better breathing and rest. You can recommend that your patients diffuse it in their bedrooms or put it under their nostrils. For Patients Asking About Essential Oils Coach your patients on this subject if they are interested. This healthy, natural remedy is a great additional step to recommended treatment, but it shouldn't be a replacement. Be sure to remind your sleep apnea patients that they should continue to use their oral appliance or CPAP machine. Additionally, remember that different essential oils, and the way they are used, will have varying results. Some oils may work better for one patient compared to the other based on the way they react to the body. Knowledge is power!
