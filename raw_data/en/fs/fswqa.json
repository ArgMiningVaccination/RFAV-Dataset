XXIX SEPT., 1917 NO. 3 OLD SERIES VOL. XXIX. NEW SERIES VOL. XXIV. THE BIRDS OF DENVER. An Annotated List. BY W. H. BERGTOLD. This list is published, not only to make available to orni- thologists in general a part of the writer's accumulation of data relating to Denver's b'irds, but also to render aid, in a small way, to bird-loving visitors to this city, especially to those whose visit may be of brief duration, and who wish to make, from a bird lover's point of view, the most of such a \" stop-off .\" It is hoped that the list will point out what birds one may reasonably expect to see in Denver at any given time, and to define, in a general way, the status of any one of such birds. Parenthetically, the writer may be permitted to digress a bit, and suggest to the visitor who may have some time left over after a general survey of Denver's birds, that it can be profit- ably spent in studying a few mountain species, which clan be found in Lookout Mountain Park. This region is easily reached in a little over an hour's trolly ride from Denver, which ride is a trip along the valley of Clear Creek, and which will in itself disclose birds not common, or seldom, seen in Denver. The situation of, and the conditions about, Denver, make it a peculiarly interesting place for the study of western Ijird life ; its geographical location makes it possible to see within its boundaries species and subspecies usually restrictecl to 114 THE WILSON EULLETIN-NO. 100 Eastern, Northern, Western or Southern Faunae, the City of Denver being at the overlapping edges of these four char- acteristic bird regions. When the writer first came to' Denver (1581) its corporate limits were much .smaller than at present, it had no large parks, and its then rather infrequent trees were nearly all native \" cottonwoods,\" which were watered by small irri- gating ditches running as gutters on either side of practically every street. The complexion of its bird life was then very different from what it is now; there were no En,glish spar- rows, fewer house finches, but more swallows (of several species) and many ravens and turkey buzzards. The imme- diately surrounding country had much of its native bird pop- ulation unchanged; the small ponds and sloughs were all frequented by many curlews, iavocets, plovers, and other forms now relatively scarce, even in districts of the State still uninhabited and uncultivated. In the intervening thirty-six years vast changes have been wrought by mlan, not only in the upbuilding of a modern city, but even in the very topography of the area now under consideration; what was then virgin prairie dotted with an occasional pond, and slightly marshy area, and with perhaps a cottonwood tree here 'and there, is now well wooded and watered park and residential districts. If in the summer one view Denver from the summit of Genesee Mountain (air line distance about 18 miles), it seems mainly to be, not a multitude of houses, and other buildings, but a dense green forest, stretching out towards, and gradually melting into, the prairie on the distant eastern horizon. This appearance is due to the great abundance of tall shade trees growing on each side of all the residence streets, and the deception is enhanced by the many trees in the extensive park system which adds so much to the beauty of the city. This park system embraces some thirty-five parks, varying in size from one to nearly five hundred acres, some of which are more or less inter-connected by wide and partly wo'oded boulevards ; forty years ago the ground cov- THE BIRDS OF DENVER 115 ered by the largest of these parks, the so-called \" City Park,\" w<as unaltered prairie, with no trees, and with one uncertain watercourse. Now after years of labor and care it is well covered by trees of many species, has three moderate sized lakes, and gives shelter to many bird species and bird indi- vaduals, which years ago were unknown or soarce in the same area. Three of the .smaller parks also lend themselves partic- ularly well to fostering bird life, to-wit, Berkeley, Cheesman, and Washington Parks. Because of the conditions briefly, land incompletely outlined above, the City of Denver furnishes a striking example of the changes in the bird population in such a locality which can be brought about by the presence and intervention of man; it is highly gratifying to see and to realize, that in Den- ver the harm to birds following in the track of civilization, has not been of its usual severity. Here man has not dealt altogether harshly with birdkind. The writer's duties, for many years, have taken him daily through one o'r more of the parks of Denver, and ,also fre- quently to the outskirts of the city; he is convinced that each year shows an increasing bird population, both in species and individuals, thro8ughout most o'f the city, but especially notice- able in Washington and Cheesman Parks. However, an ex- ception to this must be noted; the writer is certain (based on careful personlal observations) that the number of bird species and individuals has decreased in City Park during the past six years, a decrease most noticeable in the number of Bullock's orioles. This undesirable diminution is due, it seems to the writer, to the continued extensive spread of the English sparrow, and to the recent introduction of squirrels. While the latter have been detected mIany times in the act of eating the eggs and young of osur native birds, their injur- ious effects on our bird population are probably far less than those of the English sparrow, which swarms in this partic- ular park. This sparrow finds an easy living in the pheas- ant and other zoiilogical enclosures, and for a few years past, 116 THE WILSON BULLETIN-NO. 100 dfter using ordinary sites for its nests, has taken to occu- pying abandoned oriole nests; hence the conditions in City Park promote the English sparrow's usual prolificity, and cause a corresponding repression of the natural increase of the native birds, because this sparrow destroys many nests, eggs, and young of our small birds. It is a pity that some systematic effort cannot be made to restrict the multiplication of the English sparrow in our parks; a routine destruction of its nests would be in itself a large first step in the right direction. It has been a real privilege to watch, in the past years the gradual increase of birds in Denver; where thirty-five years ago there were robin, warblers, vireos, and house finches by twos and threes there 'are now dozens; where years ago nut- hatches, chickadees, and juncoes were to be found sparingly along the Platte River as it passed through Denver, they are now to be seen every winter in all the parks, and even at times in the well built up sections of the city. Furthermomre there is no doubt but that our beautiful native b'luebird would be la,s common as robins in the city were it not for the Eng- lish sparrow. These species furnish a few examples of the wonderful increase of bird life in Denver, due mainly to man's alterations in the physical and floral conditions of the region. The following named birds have been recorded in the past as having been observed (or tlaken) \"in Denver\" or \"near Denver Gull Arctic Tern Double-crested Cormorant Mottled Duck Wood Old Wife Surf Scoter Glossy Ibis White-faced Glossy Ibis Wood Ibis Little Brown Black Stilt Sandpiper Golden Plover Snowy Owl Bobolink Palm Warbler Blue-grey Gnatcatcher THE BIRDS OF DENVER 117 While many of the above named birds unquestionably may have been seen or taken within the present li&s of Denver, nevertheless it has been so often impossible to determine, from the published record, exactly where the species was seen or taken, that it has been deemed wisest to restrict the following annot,ated list to the species seen by the present writer within such limits, which may be outlined approxi- mately as follows: on the north by West 48th and West 52d Avenues, on the west by Sheridan Boulevard, on the south by Yale Avenue and on the east by Yosemite Street; these lim- its enclose an area of a little more than fifty-eight square miles. The list comprises all the species seen by the writer in Denver during the past twenty-three J-ears, and he alone (exceptions noted) is responsible for the correctness of such rec0rds.l No attempt has been made to include such other birds as are known to occur in the immediately contiguous areas of Riverside, and Fairmont cemeteries, nor in the adjoining towns of Aurora, Englewood, and Edgewater. The writer is confident that a much larger number, than this list shows, of bird species visit Denver from year to year ; in order to make such a list complete, however, one would have to make regular daily observations, a system- atic study obviously impossible to one whose vocation com- mands most of his time for other purposes. A visitor to Denver should not be disappointed if many of the species herein listed are not seen during a brief so- journ in the city, as many of the birds of the list are of irregular occurrence; nomr should a visitor feel that it is use- less to look for birds in the district under consideration dur- ing the season when nature is asleep. No month in the year in Denver is without its birds, land a street car will take one quickly to one of the larger parks, where in any season some 1 For the sake of relative completeness twenty-nine other species recorded by Cooke in his list of Colorado Birds, as having been seen or taken in Denver, are herein included, and so indicated. 118 THE \\NILSON BULLETIN-NO. 100 phase of our native bird life is certain to be seen. Further- more, the writer urges the bird lover who is not very familiar with western birds, to visit the Colorado Museum of Natural Histo'ry (in City Park) where are to be found comprehen- sive and graphic illustrations of #a iarge number of Colo- rado birds, in the mounted specimens and groups displayed in the Museum rooms. In trying to give some idea as to the relative abundance 6f the different species, the writer has done so in comparative terms only. In such matters the chances of experience and the person,al equation cannot fail to enter, hence the terms used to qualify a bird's abundance are largely relative, and must be taken as such, and as such only. 1.
