BOOKING .COM B.V. ON WRIT OF CERTIORAR I TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT REPLY BRIEF FOR THE PETITI ONERS As our opening brief explains , and as every other court of appeals that has considered similar questions has held, a term like BOOKING.COM may not be fed- erally registered as a trademark. It is undisputed that \"booking\" is a generic term for the class of hotel reser- vation services des cribed in respondent 's trademark ap- plications. T he addition of \".com\" conveys only that re- spondent operates a commercial website via the Inter-net. Under this Court's decision in Goodyear's India Rubber Glove Manufacturing Co. v. Goodyear Rubber Co., 128 U.S. 598 (1888) ( Goodyear ), those facts taken together resolve this case. Respondent's contrary arguments lack merit. Re- spondent contends that the Lanham Act , ch. 540, 60 Stat. 427 (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq. ), overruled Goodyear , but the Act contains no la nguage expressing an intent to accom- plish that resul t, and it has not previously been thought 2 to have that effect . Under respondent's approach , moreover, there is no practical distinction between ge- neric and descriptive term s, since respondent would treat either as a protectable trademark so long as a sur- vey indicates that the public associate s it with a partic- ular brand. Respondent's proposed rule is particularly ill-suited to the Internet, where the fact that only one entity at a t ime can hold the contractual rights to a par- ticular domain name gives all \"generic.com\" brand s vir- tual assurance of consumer recognition. This Court should reverse the judgment below. A. Goodyear Remains Good Law And Resolves The Question Presented Here 1. The Court in Goodyear held that adding an entity designation like \" 'Company' \" or \"Inc.\" to a generic term like \"wine,\" \"cotton,\" or \"grain\" doe s not create a pro- tectable mark, because those terms \"only indicate[] that parties have formed an associati on or part nership to deal in [the relevant] goods.\" 128 U.S. at 602 -603. The same principle applies to proposed marks that are formed by adding the top -level domain \".com\" to a generic term that denotes the goods or services pro- vided. Gov't Br. 18 -25. As a general matter, the addi- tion of \".com\" conveys only that the would -be rights - holder operates a commercial website via the Internet. BOOKING.COM therefore is no more entitled to fed- eral trademark registration than \"Booking Company\" or \"Booking Inc.\" would be. Respondent briefly contends (Br. 43 -45) that , if Goodyear remains good law, it does not apply here. Re- spondent observes (Br. 43) that the \"purpose\" of domain names is to \"facilitate online activities ,\" but it does no t explain why that distinguishes \" '.com '\" terms from \"Company\" or \"Inc. ,\" which \"facilitate\" business more 3 generally . Respondent also observes (ibid. ) that \"each domain name is unique.\" But that feature of the domain -name system does not distinguish this case from Goodyear , in which the Court did not discuss, much less rest its decision on, the possibility that multi- ple firms coul d call themselves \"Grain Inc.\" Indeed, the fact that only one entity at a time can hold the contrac- tual rights to a given domain name strengthens , rather than detracts from, the rationales for Goodyear 's rule. See Gov't Br. 32-34; pp. 14 -16, 20- 23, infra . Respondent argu es (Br. 43) that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and courts of appeals have rejected the government's approach . But the USPTO and every court of appeals to consider the issue have acknowledged Goodyear 's applicability to \"generic.com\" terms. Gov't Br. 22 -25. The USPTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ( TTAB ) has long held that Goodyear 's rea soning is \"e qually applicable * * * to cyberspace domain names.\" In re Cyber Financial. Net Inc., 65 U.S.P.Q.2d 1789, 1793 ( 2002 ). The Federal Circuit has explained that \"the comparison of \" \"'.com '\" ar the im- pression created by\" those terms, and \"typically will not add any source -identifying significance.\" ; see Gov't Br. 24. And the Ninth Circuit has held that \"ADVERTISING.COM\" is not a protectable mark, \"much as ,\" under Goodyear , \"'Advertising Company '\" would not be. Advertise.com, Inc. v. AOL Adver., Inc., 616 F.3d 974, 981- 982 (2010). Contrary to respondent's suggestion (Br. 45), no court of appeals other than the court below has accepted re- spondent's view that a standard \"generic.com\" term is 4 protectable so long as its user can show an association with its business. To the contrary, o ther courts have warned of the harms that would result if the fact that such terms \"have become identified with a first user \" were deemed a sufficient basis for registration. Advertise.com, Inc., 616 F.3d at 981 ( citation omitted ). Respondent emphasizes (Br. 43) that courts have \"le[ft] open the possibility that in unique circumstances a [top -level domain] could perform a source -indicating function,\" as where it \"produces a witty 980. T hat narrow poten- tial exception has no bearing here , because r espondent does not suggest that the \".com\" in BOOKING.COM carries such significance. Gov't Br. 25 n.6. Instead, this case falls in the heartland of \"generic.com\" terms , to which Goodyear 's reasoning applies. 1 2. Respondent contends that Congress's enactment of the Lanham Act in 1946 implicitly ove rruled Good- year . Respondent 's theories of implicit repudiation lack merit . a. Respondent suggests that the Lanha m suggests that Goodyear alone survived.\" Br. 17 -18; see Br. 40 . That approach to implied abroga- 1 Respondent's amici note the creation of new t op-level domains, like \".GURU \" and \".MEME,\" which may \"differ in their ability to modify second level domain [s].\" Int'l Trademark Ass'n Amicus Br. 10-11. Top-level domains other than those that simply designate types of entities are not before the Court. S ee USPTO, Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (TMEP) \u00a7 1209.03(m) (Oct. 2018) (instructing examining attorneys that, \"as the num ber\" or \"nature\" of top -level \"must consider any poten- tial source -indicating fun ction of \" new top- level domains) . 5 tion violates the principle that \"statutes will not be in- terpreted as changing th e common law unless they ef- fect the change with clarity .\" Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 318 (2012) ; see, e.g. , Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Solimino , 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991) . Respond- ent's argument also ignores this Court's trademark - specific recognition that the Lanham Act should be read \"in accordance with [its] common -law foundations.\" Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. , 539 U.S. 23, 37 (2003). Indeed, Judge Friendly's classic catalogue of categories along the tradem ark spectrum , which this C ourt adopted in Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Ca- bana, Inc. , 505 U.S. 763 , 768 (1992) , was based on \"[t]he cases, and in some instances the Lanham Act\" \u2014not on a wholesale revision of pre- Act preceden t. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc. , 537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir. 1976) ( emphasis added) . Respondent id entifi es no sound basis for concluding that the Lanham Act overruled Goodyear . W hile the Act \"altered existing law concerning trademark rights in several respects,\" Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc. , 469 U.S. 189, 199 (1985), none is relevant here. Respondent focuses on (Br. 40 -41) one case in which this Court held that the Lanham Act h ad altered a common - law principle. In Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prod s. Co. , 514 U.S. 159 (1995) , the Court held that the Lanham Act does not categorically bar the use of \"color alone as a trademark,\" notwithstanding contrary dicta in one of the Court's pre -Act decision s. Id. at 171- 173; Amicus at 21 -22, supra (No. 93 -1577) (explaining that the Lanham Act superseded specific \"prior common law doctrines \" regarding \"product fea- tures\"). The Court analogi zed colors to des criptive 6 marks, which the Lanham Act had made registra ble upon a showing of secondary meaning, see p p. 6-9, in- fra. Qualitex , 514 U.S. at 163. But the Court did not suggest that the same analysis appl ies to generic term s, or that the Lanham Act had overha uled more general rules governing the avail ability of trademark protec- tion. To the contrary , the Qualitex Court relied on the functionality doctrine to ensure that , despite the ab- sence of any categorical bar on the use of colors as trademarks , trademark law would guard against \"anti- competitive consequences\" like \" 'color depletion. '\" Id. at 168 -170. That re asoning is inconsistent with re- spondent's argument, which would permit mo nopoliza- tion of generic terms . See pp. 14 -16, 21 -23, infra .2 b. R espondent conten ds that, by making descriptive marks registrable upon a finding of secondary mea ning, the Lanham Act \"repudiate[d] \" Goodyear . Br. 39; see Br. 35 -40. That argument misunderstands the Lanham Act's change s to trademar k law and Goodyear 's rele- vance here. The common law recognized a spectrum of distinc- tiveness much like that under the Lanham Act, albeit with some differences in terminology. Then, as today, trademark law protected suggestive, arbitrary , and fan- ciful marks \u2014then known as \"technical trademarks\"\u2014 without requiring that the owner establish secondary meaning. 1 J. Thomas McCarthy , McCarthy on Trade- marks and Unfair Competition \u00a7\u00a7 4:3 -4:4, at 4 -3 to 2 Respondent observes that the Lanham Act overturned other common -law doctrine s by permitting registration of \"descriptive ge- ographical names like 'Lackawanna like \"YO-YO MA, ADELE , and MADONNA .\" Br. 37, 41. But unlike the departure from prior law that respondent advocates here, Congress made those change s expressly . See 15 U.S.C 1052(e)(2) and (4). 7 4-12.1 (5th e d. 2019); Harry D. Nims, The Law of Unfair Competition and Trade -Marks \u00a7 185, at 398 (2d ed. 1917) . Then, as today, the law d id no t protect generic terms , which were some- times known as the \"common \" descriptive name of the product or service . Nims \u00a7 46, at 81; id. 2 McCarthy , 12- 241; Gov't 5 n.1 . Unlike today, however, descriptive terms \u2014sometimes known as \"merely descriptive\" terms \u2014generally were not protectable as trademarks ( though the ir use was regulated by unfair -competition law if they had ac- quir ed secondary meaning ). 1 McCarthy \u00a7 4:4 , 4 -9 to 4-12.1 (citation omitted) . The Lanham Act altered this framework by making descriptive terms protectable as trademarks upon a showing of secondary meaning, i.e., if the term \"has be- come distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce. \" Park 'N Fly, Inc. , 469 U.S. at 194 (quoting 15 U.S.C. 1052(f \"a mark which * * * is merely descriptive\" of the applicant's goods ); 1 McCarthy \u00a7 4:4 , at 4 -9 to 4-12:1. But the Act \"offers no s uch exception for generic marks. \" Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , 537 F.2d at 9. Under the Lanham Act, as under the prior legal regime , \"ge- neric marks * * * are not registrable as trademarks, \" Two Pesos , Inc., 505 U.S. at 768, \"no matter how much money and effort the user of a generic term has poured into promoting the sale of its merchandise and what suc- cess it has achieved in securing public identification, \" Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , 537 F.3d at 9. Respondent argues that, because the Goodyear Court referred to the term \"Goodyear Rubber \" as \"de- scriptive of well -known classes of goods\" produced by \"Goodyear's Invention,\" Br. 35 -37 (quoting Goodyear , 8 128 U.S. at 602), the Court viewed the term as \"descrip- tive\" in the modern sense. But the better reading is that the Court considered \"Goodyear Rub ber\" to be the com- mon descriptive\u2014i.e. , generic \u2014name for the class of goods. The Court analogized \"Goodyear Rubber\" to ge- neric terms like \"wine,\" \"cotton,\" and \"grain. \" 128 U.S. at 602. And it explained that \"the incorporation of a company in the name of an article of commerce\" \u2014a ge- neric term \u2014\"without other specification, [will not] cre- ate any exclusive right to the use of the name.\" Id. at 603. Even if the Court had used the term \"descriptive\" in the modern sense, that would make no difference. Goodyear 's relevance here lies in its holding that adding an entity designation like \"Com pany\" or \"Inc.\" to an otherwise -unprotectable word does not create a pro- tectable mark . 128 U.S. at 602 -603. Because it is undis- puted that \"booking\" is generic (and thus not protecta- ble) for respondent's services, Goodyear 's key holding applies . 3 Respondent suggests in passing (Br. 38 ) that the Goodyear Court considered \" 'Company '\" and \"'Inc.'\" to be modern -day \"descriptive word[s].\" But the Court was clear that \" 'Company' only indicates that parties have formed an association or partnership to deal in [the relevant class of ] goods \"\u2014a generic meaning. 128 U.S. at 602. The term s \"Company\" and \"Inc. \" do not \"de- scribe[] the qualities or characteristics of a good or ser- vice,\" Park 'N Fly, 469 U.S. at 194, and they have little 3 Respondent states (Br. 37 -38 & n.11) that \"[p]re -Lanham Act cases and treatises\" construed Goodyear to \"bar[] trademark pro- tection for all descriptive terms.\" But the sources respondent cites do not address whether the Court view ed \"Goodyear Rubber\" as a \"common descriptive\" or \"merely descriptive\" term . 9 in common with descriptive terms like \"After Tan post - tanning lotion\" and \"5 Minute glue. \" Gov't Br. 5 (cita- tion omitted). c. Respondent argues that the Lanham Act super- seded Goodyear by defining a \"'trademark' \" to \"in- clude[] any word * * * or any combination thereof,\" 15 U.S.C. 1127\u2014 requiring \"courts and the PTO to look at the combined effect of the 'mark.' \" Br. 39 (citation omitted). But the words \"combination thereof \" in a def- initional provision would be an extremely subtle way for Congress to overturn this Court's precedent. This Court had already adopt ed the so -called \"anti -dissection\" rule, explaining in Estate of P. D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Commis- sioner of Patents , 252 U.S. 538 , that \"[t]he commercial impression of a trade- mark is derived from it as a whole.\" Yet as respondent observes (Br. 38), the Court in P. D. Beckwith cited Goodyear with approval. 252 U.S. at 544. Just as the P. D. Beckwith Court 's enunciation of a general rule regarding assess- ment of potential trademarks did not overturn Good-year 's more specific holding , the subsequent ly enacted definition o f \"trademark\" in Section 1127 left Goodyear intact . Respondent is in any event incorrect about Good- year 's method of analysis. The Court considered the terms \"Goodyear Rubber\" and \"Company\" separately before determining whether the combination functioned as a protectable trademark. 128 U.S. at 602 -603. In considering combined terms under the Lanham Act, courts and the USPTO likewise have \"weigh [ed] in- dividual proposed] mark\" before \"de-termin[ing] whether the mark a s a whole * * * conveys any distinctive s ource -identifying impression.\" Oppe at 1174 -1175 ; see, e.g., 10 In re Tires, Tires, T ires Inc., 94 U.S.P.Q.2d 1153, Examining Procedure (TMEP ) (Oct. 2018) (multiple generic s); at 12 -166. 3. Respondent contends ( Br. 39-40) that Congress overruled Goodyear by adopting the prim ary-significance test for evaluating whether a particular mark is generic . That is incorrect. See Gov't Br. 36 -40. a. The primary -significance test origin ated in this Court's pre-Lanham Act decision in Kellogg Co. v. Na- tiona l Biscuit Co. , 305 U.S. 111 (1938). There, the Na- tional Biscuit Company , which first made \"Shredded Wheat\" and held a patent on the product during the years when it was first sold, sought to enjoin Kellogg from calling its competi ng product by that name after the patent expired . Id. at 113 -114, 116 . The Court held that, because \"Shredded Wheat\" was \"the generic term of the article ,\" \"the original maker of the product ac- quired no exclusive right to use it.\" Id. at 116. The Na- tional Biscuit Company also argued that it had acquired \"the exclusive right to the name 'Shredded Wheat' \" un- der unfair -competition law because, due to its long pe- riod of exclusive use, \"many people ha [d] come to asso- ciate the product, and as a consequence the name by which the product is generally known, with the plain- tiff's factory.\" Id. at 118. The Court rejected that ar- gument, explain ing that \"[t]here [wa]s no basis * * * for applying the doctrine of secondary meaning.\" Ibid. \"[T]o establish a trade name in the term 'shredded wheat ,'\" the Court explained, \" the plaintiff must show more than a subordinate meaning which applies to it \"; \"[i]t must show that the primary significance of the 11 term in th e minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.\" Ibid. b. Respondent does not appear to contend (Br. 18) that Kellogg itself overruled Goodyear . The opinion in Kellogg did not cite Goodyear or address whether the ad- dition of an entity designation like \"Company\" or \"Inc.\" can render protectable an otherwise- unprotectable term . And respondent does not identify (Br. 2 1-22 & n n.5-6) any subsequent de cision suggesting that Kellogg over- ruled Goodyear , or tha t under Kellogg , adding \"Com- pany\" or \"Inc.\" to a generic term creates a protectable mark . Respondent instead suggests (Br. 19 -24, 39- 40) that Goodyear has implicitly been abrogated by Congres s's 1984 codification of the primary -significance test. But as respondent acknowledges (Br. 23 ), Congress codified the primary -significance test because, \"in 1982, the Ninth Circuit departed from [that] test to cancel Parker Brothers' registration of M ONOPOLY .\" Congress re- sponded by amend ing the Lanham Act's cancell ation provision to state that \"[t]he primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public [,] rather than [the] purchaser motivation \" test that the Ninth Circuit had applied , \"shall be the test for determining whether the registered mark has b ecome the generic name of goods or services on or in connection with which it has been used.\" 15 U.S.C. 1064(3). Th at amendment did \"nothing more than cure the problem created by the [N]inth [C]ircuit ,\" A Bill to Clarify the Circumstances Under Whi ch a T rademark May Be Canceled or Aban- doned: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Patents, Cop- yrights and Trademarks of the on the Judiciary , 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1 984) (statement of 12 Sen. Leahy), and it was \"not intended to effect im- portant substantive changes in the mainstream of trademark law,\" 98 Cong. Rec. 28,866 (1983) ( statement of Sen. Hatch). Certainly, nothing in the 1984 amend- ment suggests that C ongress inte nded to overrule longstanding doctrines like the rule announced in Good- year . See Gov't Br. 37 -40.4 c. Respondent emphasizes (Br. 21 -22 & nn.5- 6) that the USPTO and courts often apply the primary - significance test in determining initial registra bility, as well as in making the cancellation decisions to which Section 1064(3) expressly applies . But that does not mean that the USPTO or courts do, or should, apply the test in the same way whenever they decide whether a particular mark is generic. As respondent acknowl- edges (Br. 23 n.7), courts have \"refine[d] the primary - significa nce test\" in particular contexts , such as where a new product is the first in its category . In that situa- tion, the \"product name, even if it does tend to indicate the producer or source of the product, must nonetheless be considered\" generic, Genes ee Brew ing Co. v. Stroh Brewing Co. , 124 F.3d 137, 144 (2d Cir. 1987) (emphasis omitted) , because \"competitors need it more to describe their goods than the claimed markholder needs it to dis-tinguish its goods Co. 1986); see Gene- see Brewing Co. , 124 F.3d at 145 (test for new category 4 Respondent's suggestion (Br. 40) that the primary -significance test must have overruled Goodyear , because \"the PTO has registered multiple GOODYEA R trademarks,\" reflects a misunderstand ing of Goodyear 's relevance. Such registrations show, at most, that for some goods \"Goodyear\" itself was ( or has become) distinctive \u2014not that Co.,\" \"Generic Inc.,\" or \"generic.com\" terms are pro- tectable as trademarks. 13 is a \"useful complement to, rather than a rejection of, the primary significance test\"). Other doctrines likewise co -exist with or refine the primary -significance test. For example, under the doc- trine of foreign equivalents, \"foreign words used as a mark are translated into English and then tested for * * * genericness.\" 2 McCarthy \u00a7 12:41 , at 12 -190. Thus, the term \"Ha -Lush -Ka,\" which is Hungarian for noodles, is generic for that product regardless of whether most American consumers (who presumably do not speak Hungarian) would associate the term \"Ha- Lush -Ka\" with a particular producer. Weiss Noo- dle Co. v. Golden Cracknel & Specialty Co. , 290 F.2d 845, 847 (C.C.P.A. 1961). Goodyear 's continued vitality is consistent with these other doctrines. Under Goodyear , \"Grain Inc.\" is not protectable because consumers would understand the combination to \"indicate[] that parties have formed an association or partnership to deal in\" \"grain .\" Good- year , 128 U.S. at 602 ; see Gov't Br. 4, 43 -44. That is true even if the public might understand \"Grain Inc.\" to re- fer to a specific company \u2014either because consumers do not use the term \"Grain Incs.\" to refer to in corporated grain merchants as a class , or because the applicant has developed an association between the term and its own business. See Gov't Br. 38 -40; accord Resp. Br. 42 (ap- pearing to agree with holding of In re Wm. B. Coleman Co., 93 U.S.P.Q.2d 2019, 2027 (T.T.A.B. 2010), that \"ELECTRIC CANDLE COMPANY\" is generic be- cause consumers would understand it \"to refer to a com- pany that offers\" or \"sells electric candles\"). If that were not the case, then any company could obtain a trademark on a generic word or \"Generic Inc.\" term \u2014 including respondent's example (Br. 8) of \"Oranges\" or 14 \"Oranges Inc.\" \u2014simply by investing enough money in advertising, a result that would be fundamentally incon- sistent with longstanding trademark law. See pp. 21- 23, infra . 4. In re cent decades , the TTAB has consistently de- nied trademark registrations on the ground that adding terms like \"Co.\" or \"Inc.\" does not add trademark sig- nificance, often citing Goodyear . See, e.g., In (T.T.A.B. June 7, 2007); In re Engineering Res. Gr p., Inc., No. 75 /931377, 2002 WL 31835449, at *5 (T.T.A.B. Dec. 18, 2002); In re Prod s. Co., 8 U.S.P.Q.2d 1863, 1866 (T.T.A.B. 1988); In U.S.P.Q. 1203, 1205 (T.T.A.B. 1984 ). And as the ap- pendix to thi s brief demonstrates, see App. , infra , 1a- 65a, the USPTO has denied registration (or required a disclaimer of the words as generic) for scores of other similar marks. Yet r espondent identifies no judicial or administrative opinion, treatise, or scholarly article stating that Goodyear has been overruled \u2014whether by this Court's 1938 decision in Kellogg , Congress's 1946 enactment of the Lanham Act, or Congress's 1984 amendment of the Act. B. Sound Trademark Policy Supports The Conclusion That Adding A Top -Level Domain To A Generic Term Does Not Create A Protectable Mark 1. Goodyear 's rationales for not recognizing \"Ge- neric Inc.\" trademarks \u2014and, in particular, the Court's recognition that treat ing s uch term s as protectable marks would imped e competition \u2014apply fully to \"generic.com\" terms. Gov't Br. 26 -30; se e Electronic Frontier Found. Amicus Br. 8 -13, 19 -20. \" [S]uch trade- mark protection would potentially reach almost any use of the generic term in a domain name,\" inhibiting use of 15 \"a vast array of simple, easy to remember domain names and designations that describe the services pro- vided.\" Advertise.com , Inc. , 616 F.3d at 981 . The na- ture of t he Internet would exacerbate that competitive harm. Treat ing \"generic.com\" terms as protectable trademarks would permit first adopters to leverage the fact that only one entity at a time can hold the contrac- tual rights to a part icular domain name into additional trademark -law benefits that would not be available to brick -and-mortar \"Generic Inc.\" equivalent s. See Gov't Br. 31 -34; Pet. App. 28a -29a (Wynn, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Trademark Scholars Amici Br. 13-15. Respondent suggests (Br. 28), for the first time in the litigation , that it would not use trademark registration to stop competitors from adopting similar domain names like \"hotelbooking.com\" and \"eurobookings.com.\" But respondent previously info rmed the USPTO that it \"con- siders the use and registration of EBOOKING.COM to be a potential infringement.\" J.A. 192. Respondent's previously stated intent to use its mark to oppose that form of competition is especially unsurprising because, if respondent were willing to accede to competitors' use of such variant s, federal registration of BOOKING.COM as a trademark would add little to the existing practical dis-incentives to competitors' use of that precise term. See Gov' t Br. 30 . It is a fundamental pr inciple of trademark law, moreover, that the owner of a protected trademark can prevent its competitors from using not only the pre- cise mark at issue, but confusingly similar terms as well. See 15 U.S.C. 1052(d), 1114(1). Respondent's apparent reluctance to invoke that principle with respect to its own proposed mark simply reinforces the conclusion that 16 BOOKING.COM is not protectable as a trademark in the first place. 2. Respondent suggests (Br. 25 -26) that, without trademark protection, it is defenseless against unscru- pulous businesses that use similar URLs or misspell- ings to capture visitors that intended to visit respond- ent's website. That is incorrect . a. Unfair -competition law p rovides substantial pro- tection against efforts to mislead consumers. See Gov't Br. 34 -35. Respondent assert s (Br. 48) that state unfair - competition laws \"typically bar relief absent actual fraud.\" But while actual deception may be required for damages, unfair -competition law gen erally permits in- junctive relief \"upon proof that deception is likely. \" Re- statement (Third) of Unfair Competition \u00a7 4 cmt. c, at 50 (1995) ; see id. \u00a7 15 cmt. d, at 148- 149; see also, e.g. , Kel- logg, 305 U.S. at 122. Moreover, although some state -law claims may depend on a finding of bad faith, courts have held that federal unfair -competition claims generally do not. See Gene see Brewing Co. , 124 F.3d at 149 ; Blinded Veterans Ass'n v. Blinded Am. Veterans Found. , 872 F.2d 1035, 1045 (D.C. Cir. 1989) ( R.B. Ginsb urg, J.) . In any event, respondent's complaint that its rights are less comprehensive than those available for more distinctive marks simply reflects \"the peril of attempt- ing to build a brand around a generic term.\" Adver- tise. com, Inc., 616 F.3d at 980 n .6. Like other busi- nesses, r espondent could have obtained greater protec- adopting a n \"elaborate technical trade- mark []\" like \" D R. DRAKE 'S GERMAN CROUP REMEDY ,\" Br. 49) by adopting an inherently distinctive mark like \"Amazo n\" for online shopping services, and, if it de- sired, a ppending a top -level domain (\"Amazon.com\") . Or respondent could have chosen a descriptive term to 17 communicate characteristics of its goods or services , and demonstrated secondary meaning. The only choice trademark law will not protect is the one respondent made: using the very name of the relevant good or ser- vice (\"Wine\" or \"Booking\" ), with or without a tion like \"Inc.\" or \".com.\" See Pet. App. 28a (Wynn, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). b. Respondent argue s (Br. 25) that greater protec- tion is necessary here because the Internet \"has created new av enues for confusion, diversion, dilution, and fraud .\" Respondent relies (Br. 25 -26) on the Anticyber- squatting Consumer Prot ection Act (ACPA) , 15 U. S.C. 1125(d), which impose s civ il liability on anyone who, in bad faith, \"registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that * * * in the cas e of a mark that is distinctive * * * is identical or confusingly similar to that mark.\" 15 U.S.C. 1125(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I). But Congress limit ed that protection to \"distinctive\" marks , and there is no reason to suppose that \"generic.com\" terms categorically sat- isfy that requirement. And to the extent \"generic.com\" businesses need additional protections, the ACPA man- ifest s Congress's attentiveness to the concerns of online businesses when appropriate . 5 3. Respondent contends (Br. 27 -29) that registration of \"Generic Company, Generic Inc., or Generic.com\" names would not \"stymie competitors' mar keting and amici cite ( e.g., Internet Commerce Ass'n Amicus Br. 21) the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy , https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy -2012- 02-25-en, which applies to the bad -faith use of a registered domain name that is iden- tical or confusingly similar t o a trademark. Id. \u00a7 4(a). That policy \u2014 adopted by a non -profit organization in 1999\u2014 says nothing about congressional intent regarding the protectability of \"generic.com\" terms. 18 sales of competing versions of the same products,\" on the theory that the USPTO already has registered many such terms. See Br. 35, 48-49. That is incorrect. The appendix to this brief provides a sample of the hun- dreds, if not thousands, of marks for which the USPTO has refused registration based on the agency's view that Goodyear applies to such terms. The overwhelming majority of respondent's suppos- edly cont rary examples are irrelevant to the question presented here. This Court held in Goodyear that ap- pending a corporate -entity designation like \"Company\" or \"Inc.\" to an otherwise -unprotectable term does not create a protectable mark . Lower c ourts have con- cluded, and the government agrees, that the same rule governs analogous top -level domain designations like \".com. \" Many of respondent's examples 46- 47 (capitalization altered) , which the gov- ernment has not argued are governed by Goodyear . While respondent's examples may or may not be ge- neric, their fate will not be decided here. Many of respondent's examples are inapposite for the additional reason that they do not include terms that are generic for the class of goods or services listed in the registration . See Gov't Br. 3 -4. For example, \"T HE PREGNANCY COMPANY \" (Resp. Br. 29; Resp. Br. App. 12a) is registered not for pregnan cy itself or general pregnancy -related goods, but for, inter alia , \"[p]rovid- ing medical diagnostic testing services to detect complications .\"6 \"L AW.COM \" (Resp. Br. 4; Resp. 6 Descriptions of goods and services may be found by searching USPTO, Trademark Status & Document Retrieval (TSDR) , https://tsd r.uspto.gov/ . 19 Br. App. 3a) is registered not for legal services, but for \"non-downloadable online newspapers, magazines, and newsletters in the field of law .\" Many of respondent's other examples are descriptive of the subject matter or intended audience of publications or websites, but are not generic for the publications or websites themselves. Unsurprisingly, \" PARENTS .COM\" (Resp. Br. App. 4a) does not sell parents, but instead \"pro- vide[s] online magazines in the fields of child development parenting.\" And \"J n on issues of interest to the Jewish community.\" 7 Finally, the USPTO receives nearly half a million trademark -registration applications annually and em- ploys hundreds of examining attorneys . Absent opposi- tion, i f a USPTO employee erroneously permits a mark to be registered , the TTAB has no occasion to review the decision. See 15 U.S.C. 1063, 1070. \"[S]uch errors do not bind the USPTO to improperly register\" similar 7 Respondent's examples also ignore that the USPTO follows Federal Circuit precedent, because that court directly reviews the agency's registration decisions. Some of respondent's examples thus reflect judicial decisions with which the USPTO may not agree. See, e.g., In re The Am. Fertility Soc' y, 188 F.3d 1341, 1346- 1348 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ( suggesting that a phrase of three or more words, such as \"Society for Reproductive Medicine,\" cannot be generic if the words have not previously been used in the precise order) (cap- italization altered) ; In re Dial -A-Mattress Operating Corp., 240 F.3d 1341, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (holding that 1- 888-MATRESS was not generic in the absence of evidence \"that the relevant public refers to the class of shop -at-home telephone mattress retailers as '1 -888-M-A-T-R-E-S-S' \") (emphasis added) ; but see In re 1800Mattress.com IP, LLC , 586 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ( ex- plaining that consumers need not \" use,\" but must \" understand the term to be generic\") . 20 marks in the future. In re Shinnecock Smoke Shop , 571 F.3d 1171, 1174 (Fed. Cir. 2009), cert. denied 558 U.S. 1149 (2010). Congress has authorized admin- istrative and judicial review to ensure that errors may be corrected, see 15 U.S.C. 1070, 1071, and it has au- thorized cancellation \"[a]t any time\" if a mark \"becomes * * * generic, \" 15 U.S.C. 1064(3). Thus, to the extent that trademark examiners have erred in permitting registration of some fraction of the marks in respond- ent's brief and appendix, mechanisms exist for correct- ing those mistakes. But r espondent cannot leverage any such errors to overturn this Court's precedent. C. Respondent's Survey Evidence Does Not Provide A Sound Basis For Treating BOOKING.COM As A Registrable Trademark 1. Goodyear 's application to this case is straightfor- ward. Respondent does not dispute that \"booking\" is generic for the relevant class of its services. N or does it contest that \".com\" adds only its usual meaning, i.e. , that respondent operates a commercial website via the Internet . Thus, just as no company could federally reg- ister \"Booking Company\" or \"Booking Inc.\" as a should not be permitted to register \"BOOKING.COM.\" Respondent's survey evidence does not alter that conclusion. W hile surveys may be relevan t in many cases, they are ill -suited to the specific context s of \"Ge- neric Inc.\" and \"generic. com\" terms. Many individuals might understand \"Grain Inc.\" to refer to a particular business, yet under Goodyear such terms cannot re- ceive trademark protection. See Gov't Br. 36 -44; pp. 12- 14, supra. The problem is even more acute on the Internet. Be- cause only one entity at a time may hold the contractua l 21 rights to a given domain name , consumers are likely to infer that any particular \"generic.com\" term refers to a specific entity, even if they have no prior awareness of the particular business involved . \"[S]erious difficulties inher e[]\" in using surveys in this context, because they do not necessarily \" distinguish between de facto se cond- ary meaning based on domain name exclusivity and trademark meaning.\" Trademark Scholars Amici Br. 20. Respondent's survey evidence confirms the point. Re- spondent argues (Br. 33) that the survey shows that 74.8% of survey respondents \"identified BOO KING.COM as a brand \" name, rather than as a general reference to hotel reservation websites. See Pet. App. 16a. Yet 33% of sur- vey respondents identified WASHINGMACHINE.COM as a brand name, even though no such brand exists \u2014and even though no survey respondent made the same error regarding SUPERMARKET. J.A. 53, 66; see J.A. 268 n.12. Thus, while respondent points out that \"majority us-age\" often \"controls\" under the Br. proposed per se rule that all gener- icness inquiries must turn on survey evidence is incon- sistent with the Lanham Act's preservation of the dis- tinction between generic terms, which are not eligible for trademark protection even upon a showing of sec- ondary meaning, and descriptive terms, which are po- tentially registrable if secondary meaning is 40 -42; pp. 6-7, supra. Courts ha ve long recognized that \"[g]eneric terms cannot be rescued by proof of distinctiveness or secondary meaning no matter how voluminous the proffered evidence may be.\" In re Northland Alu minum Prods., Inc. , 777 F.2d 1556, 22 1558 (Fed. Ci r. 1985) (brackets in original). Thus, \" no matter how much money and effort the user of a generic term has poured into promoting the sale of its merchan- dise and what success it has achieved in securing publi c identification, \" the term remains generic and therefore unregistrable . Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , 537 F.2d at KP Permanent Make -Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impres- sion I, Inc. , 543 U.S. 111, 122 (2004) (trademark law does not countenance one entity obtainin g \"a complete monopoly on use of a descriptive term simply by grab- bing it first\") . Many courts therefore have declined to rely on survey evidence purporting to show that consum- ers associate a generic term with a specific producer. Gov't Br. 42 ; Trademark Scholars Amici Br. 15 -18. Respondent purports (Br. 31, 32 n.10) not to contest \"the proposition that no amount of evidence of con- sumer perceptions can make generic terms non - generic .\" Instead, re spondent contends (Br. 31 -33) that this principl e applies only where \"a mark * * * has al- ready become generic \" because a \"judicial decision\" has so \"deemed\" it, or the term was \"commonly used or un-derstood \" as generic before a particular user adopted it. But while respondent accuses the government of \"atextual feat[s],\" Br. 43, it does no t attempt to link its artificial limitations to the Lanham Act 's te rms. Nor are those limitations grounded in the common law, which has long t reated generic terms as insusceptible to monopolization by first users. Respondent's limitations are a particularly poor fit for \"Generic Inc.\" and \"generic.com\" terms . Contrary to re- spondent's suggestion (Br. 8), no consumer would use or understand \"Oranges Inc.\" to refer to the fruit generally, and no court would have occa sion to label that term g e- neric before a particular business adopt ed it. The same 23 would be true for \" oranges.com .\" Thus, r espondent's ar- gument effectively would result in trademark protection for all \"Generic Inc.\" or \" generic.com\" terms so long as a fir st adopter could demonstrate secondary meaning \u2014 a task made much easier by the nature of the \".com\" suf- fix and the exclusive contractual rights conveyed by the domain -name system. That result contravenes Good- year and bedrock trademark -law principles. * * * * * For the foregoing reasons and those stated in our opening brief, the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.
