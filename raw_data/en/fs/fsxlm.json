I realized at a young age that I also really enjoy working with people. During my early years of undergraduate schooling, I sought a career path that would encompass my passions. I decided medicine was the right field for me. I earned a bachelor of science in Molecular and Microbiology and a bachelor of science in Psychology from the University of Central Florida (UCF), graduating with honors on the pre-medical tract. During my time at UCF I spent hours shadowing doctors to get a feel for my future \"life as a doctor.\" Through this experience, I realized many of the doctors I worked with were unhappy with their careers and felt as though they could not provide the time and space necessary to help their patients with their health concerns. Many of these doctors were only \"allowed\" to spend 7-10 minutes with each patient due to the constraints of managed healthcare. I knew that this was not the way I had hoped to practice medicine. I decided not to apply to conventional medical schools during my last year of undergraduate training, and instead began working at a local health food store while I rerouted my career path. During this time, I learned about many different natural options for health and healing. I didn't know about naturopathic medicine then (there aren't many ND's in Florida), so I decided to go to massage school. There I trained in deep tissue massage and advanced massage techniques. Through my training in massage, I was awakened to a whole new medical world. For the first time, I was helping people in a way that made sense to me. One of our instructors was a naturopathic doctor and I was inspired to learn more about the medicine. After learning about the principles of naturopathic medicine, I knew it was the right choice for me. I decided to move to Oregon and study both naturopathic and classical Chinese medicine. I attended a 6-year medical program at The National College of Natural Medicine in Portland, OR, earning a Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine and a Masters of Science in Oriental Medicine. [To learn more about naturopathic medicine, click here.](/naturopathic-medicine) I also obtained a Certificate in Natural Childbirth, which provides advanced training in naturopathic midwifery and obstetrics. Through my studies of natural childbirth, I have gained insights to help patients with fertility, pre-natal care (preparing for pregnancy, nutrition for pregnancy) and post-natal care (lactation support, post-partum depression, etc).

As part of the classical Chinese medicine program, I did additional training in 5-element acupuncture. This type of acupuncture works not only at the level of the physical body, but also through integration of body, mind and spirit. Through an understanding of Qi or energy flow through the meridians as well as the ancient inherent wisdom given in the name of each acupuncture point, I select a personalized set of points for each patient that can help them get past many physical and mental limitations. [Click here to learn more about 5-element acupuncture.](/chinese-medicineacupuncture) Education is an important part of my practice. During my studies, I gave lectures for local health food stores on a variety of topics including healthy eating, traditional diets, gluten-free eating, and other lifestyle topics. I also helped create a 12-week series of community-based workshops in nutrition and hands-on cooking that teaches people how to purchase, prepare, and enjoy simple, healthy meals. The program was launched in 2010 and has been serving the greater Portland metro area since that time. After graduation, I became an instructor at the National College of Natural Medicine, leading these same classes for the [Food As Medicine Institute](http://foodasmedicineinstitute.com/). The classes are titled \"Food As Medicine Everyday\" and you can click [here](http://foodasmedicineinstitute.com/nutrition-programs/food-as-medicine-everyday-fame/) to learn more about them. I am dedicated to educating the community about healthy lifestyle choices, with an emphasis on nutrition. I often give lectures in the community, [click here to check for upcoming events](/events1). If you would like to have me come lecture at an event for your organization, please contact me at [drshawnteyates@gmail.com](http://drshawnteyates@gmail.com). Additionally, during my time at NCNM I discovered anthroposophy and anthroposophically extended medicine. This is a system of medicine that is separate from naturopathic and Chinese medicine, but complementary to both. It is a holistic system that combines modern medicine with the concept of an integrated body, soul, and spirit. I incorporate the insights of anthroposophical medicine along with naturopathy and Chinese medicine to provide more tools for my patients. Health and medicine aren't my only passions. Spending time with family and enjoying nature are necessities for me. In my free time, you will find me cooking or gardening with my fianc\u00e9e. We love to ferment all types of vegetables and beverages along with preparing delicious and nutritious homemade meals. I also love spending time outdoors, wild-crafting, and foraging. "}
