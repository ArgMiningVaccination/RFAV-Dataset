Actually, what's sad is that [she really doesn't support the vaccination leads to autism position](http://autism2008.wordpress.com/2008/03/14/hillary-clinton-a-champ-responses/): Would you support a large-scale federal study ofthe differences in health outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups? Yes. We don't know what, if any, kind of link there is between vaccines and autism - but we should find out. The lack of research on treatments, interventions, and services for children and adults with autism is a major impediment to the development of delivery of quality care. We need evidence-based research on what works and what doesn't in order to provide the most effective services for people with autism. In addition to a large-scale federal study, I will create a task force that would include significant representation from the autism community and would be charged with identifying gaps in evidence-based biomedical research, behavioral treatments, and services for children and adults with autism. The task force would present these findings to Congress and the Executive Branch and would make recommendations on how to make evidence-based treatments, interventions, and services available at the state and local levels. Once the task force has completed its work, I will provide funding to establish state-based demonstration grants to provide these evidence-based autism treatments, interventions, and services. Would you support a federal right for families and individuals to choose for themselves which vaccines they will use? As President, I will support efforts to ensure that vaccines are safe and effective, including independent reviews and large-scale studies. All Americans should have access to accurate and comprehensive information about vaccinations. I hate to tap into stereotypes, but if that's not a stereotypical Clinton weasel, I don't know what is. The shame is that I've talked with some of Clinton's health policy people, and they're smarter than this. Update: [McCain has fully embraced this crap](http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2008/03/ignorance.html), and [Obama seems to be pulling the same weasel dodge](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/04/dr_obama_and_dr_mccain.html). Bipartisanship at last.... Every dollar we spend on this woo is a dollar we're not spending to find the real causes of autism.
