We have the advantage of Dr. Chris Wertin's years of study into why some people would not get better even though they had received treatment from chiropractors and medical doctors. Through research and development, Dr. Chris was able to make breakthroughs into understanding what care a body really needs to heal. Innovative Chiropractic Care for Chronic Health Problems Early in his practice, Dr. Chris realized he was seeing patients that had been to every other chiropractor and orthopedic doctor in town and many had been to large, well-known clinics as well. They were seeking solutions to stubborn health problems but no one was able to help them. He finally set aside what he had been taught and found a way to determine the real problem preventing people from healing and work out how it could be corrected. Finally, as he implemented his discoveries, the chronic health issues of patients were being resolved. The Activator Method Dr. Chris began researching the use of the Activator Method while he was still in chiropractic college. An Activator is a handheld instrument that administers a precise, low-force adjustment to a patient. Its precision and gentleness allow it to be used to adjust newborn babies as well as 90-year-old patients. The Activator Method of adjusting, coupled with his own discoveries, has helped Dr. Chris to turn complex cases around quickly. Chiropractic Neck Adjustments Neck pain is one of the most common complaints to send patients to a chiropractor. Pain can result from injury or from deterioration of the structures in the cervical (neck) spine. Stress, poor posture or emotional upsets can also cause or worsen problems in the neck. With our unique, low-force application of the Activator, any of the chiropractors at Advanced Chiropractic Services may be able to help resolve the basic cause of your short-term or chronic neck pain. When you visit one of our chiropractors for a chiropractic neck adjustment, they will first ask you about the problem and perform tests to determine the real reason the problem exists. Your muscle strength or range of motion may be tested at this time. The philosophy of our doctors is to understand the actual cause and address it so that healing and correction can occur quickly, not months later. You want your life and function back now, not later, and we appreciate that. With a full understanding of the correction needed, our doctors will then provide a chiropractic neck adjustment to begin the healing process. Our entire goal is your improved health so you can live a happier and more enjoyable life. Chiropractic Adjustments for Migraines Migraine sufferers have long sought out chiropractic adjustments for relief of these persistent and debilitating headaches. Chiropractic care has been a viable, proven and drug-free alternative to the medications that are the only solution offered by some medical doctors. With the specific Activator Method of chiropractic developed by Dr. Chris, he has been able to resolve migraines and many other stubborn health issues. His patients are amazed when they finally see a resolution of a health complaint that was robbing them of their quality of life. Shoulder Chiropractic Adjustments From athletes to homemakers, shoulder pain can make performing daily tasks difficult. A shoulder adjustment from a chiropractor can quickly reduce restrictions in the joint and allow healing to begin. As with other health conditions treated at Advanced Chiropractic Services, the focus is always on finding out exactly why there is a problem and how it may be able to be resolved for good. Lower Back Chiropractic Adjustments There are many contributing factors that eventually add up to lower back pain. They include traffic accidents, injuries from lifting heavy objects, development of osteoarthritis, and damaged disks. Lower back chiropractic adjustments restore movement and correct the position of the lumbar (low back) vertebrae to start the healing process. As with every treatment, the goal is the rehabilitation of this area of the body. The intention of the chiropractors at Advanced Chiropractic Services is to provide you with excellent results from lower back chiropractic adjustments in the shortest time possible.
