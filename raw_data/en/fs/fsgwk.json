We are the Faculty's principal source of expertise in epidemiology (including clinical epidemiology), biostatistics and large-scale clinical data management. We have particular expertise in large epidemiological studies, multicentre clinical trials, clinical registries, evidence synthesis and health social science. Our skills underpin high quality research in public health, clinical and health services research. We have research programs in each of these areas.Purpose and commitments Our research addresses several of the principal agendas of healthcare including: chronic disease prevention and health promotion; increasing the evidence base of healthcare; improving quality and safety of healthcare; advancing health information technology; improving cost-effectiveness; improved translation of biomedical research into clinical and public health practice; prolonging disability-free survival among the elderly; improving the care of the critically ill and injured; reducing adverse health impacts in the environment and the workplace; and global health improvement. We work closely with the Alfred Hospital and other major Monash-affiliated hospitals, research institutes and public health units within Victoria. Our skills provide a key resource underpinning translational research within our Faculty.The School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (SPHPM) is the second largest school within the Monash University Faculty of Medicine Nursing and Health Sciences.School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine | 1 Purpose and commitments i Contents 1 Head of School Report 2 Highlights 4 Victorian Bushfires Report 6 Swine Flu Pandemic Report 6 New Centres and Registries 8 New Centres 8 New Registries 9 Research and education summary 10 Organisational Chart 11 Divisions 12 Prevention Science 12 Department of Forensic Medicine (DFM) 12 The Centre for Obesity Research and Education (CORE) 13 Clinical Epidemiology 13 Jean Hailes Clinical Research Unit 13 The Australasian Cochrane Centre 14 Cardiovascular Prevention Research Unit 14 Centre of Cardiovascular Research and Education in Therapeutics (CCRET) 14 Respiratory Epidemiology Group (REG) 15 Monash Department of Clinical Epidemiology (Cabrini Hospital) 15 Health Services and Global Health Research 15 Department of Health Social Science 16 Occupational and Environmental Health 16 Critical Care Research 17 Health Research Methodology 17 Executive Board 18Contents Research Governance 22 Awards, Prizes and Fellowships 24 Registries 28 Clinical Informatics and Data Management Unit 28 Staff 29 Registries and clinical trials managed by the CIDMU 30 Visitors 32 Seminars 34Short courses 36 Teaching 38 Undergraduate 38Honours program 39 Teaching - Postgraduate 40 Master of Public Health (MPH) 41 Doctoral 44SPHPM Doctoral program 44 Doctor of Public Health and the Victorian Public Health Training Scheme 44 Scholarships 45 New students enrolled during 2009 46 Continuing Students enrolled during 2009 48 Funding sources 52 2009 Funding 52 Research Funding Beginning in 2009 52 Continuing Grants 54 Publications 58 Content 58 Staff 72Head of School Report In 2009, the School responded to two major public health issues critical to Victoria and Australia. The year began on a sad note as a result of the Victorian bushfires. This presented a major undertaking for our colleagues in the Victorian Institute for Forensic Pathology. Other parts of the School also advised on the effects of fire-fighting chemicals on drinking water, reported on the management of those hospitalised with burns and on the impact of heat stress on older people. The H1N1/09 influenza outbreak was the second major health issue for the year. Again, individuals from several parts of the School contributed to the national public health response. Members of our Infectious Disease Epidemiology Unit helped to develop the national clinical and infection control guidelines, set up a hospital-based sentinel surveillance program (FluCAN) and performed studies of the immunological responses to influenza infection and vaccination. Other contributions included studying the effect of the influenza pandemic on the supply of blood and blood products and an involvement in the national committee monitoring the safety of the H1N1/09 vaccine.Both these examples portray only some of the contributions of our staff to major public health issues and the depth of expertise present in the School. We provide this expertise in a wide range of areas to governments and other organisations in Australia and abroad. We employ over 100 doctoral-qualified staff and are now the second largest School within the Monash Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences. We have a staff of over 300 and an annual budget of $34 million of which $21 million is derived from research, with over $11 million from the National Health and Medical Research (NHMRC) and Australian Research Council (ARC). This strong research environment has increased our capacity for clinical, public health and health services research. Research In research, we continued with our long-term goal of strengthening our 'methodology core' of epidemiology, biostatistics and data-management. This will progressively strengthen our capacity to undertake high quality clinical, public health and health services research. Our capacity to handle large health-related datasets has now reached a high level of sophistication. This is made possible thanks to our newly formed Clinical Informatics and Data-Management Unit and our excellent Biostatics Unit that has been fundamental in underpinning our research performance. We also progressed in our second major goal of developing a high-level infrastructure of large trials, cohort studies and registries. This took a major step forward with funding from the US National Institute of Aging for the ASPirin for Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial. This study is being undertaken in collaboration with colleagues at the Berman Centre for Outcomes and Clinical Research in Minneapolis, headed by Richard Grimm. The study will recruit nineteen thousand participants who will be randomised to either low-dose aspirin or placebo and followed for five years. Our registry development program continued with the establishment of a new pilot prostate cancer registry and two specialised registries in haematology in conjunction with colleagues at the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. Among other research highlights in 2009 were the successful renewal of the NHMRC Program grant by Henry Krum and Chris Reid (to study chronic heart and kidney disease) and a Capacity Building Grant to a consortium of researchers headed by Malcolm Sim and the Monash Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health. The School was also successful in gaining two of the new NHMRC partnership grants, one for transfusion research and the other for studies of water quality. The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Clinical Trials Group successfully applied for renewal of an NHMRC Enabling Grant. Major funding was also received from the Victorian Neurotrauma Initiative for a variety of projects including a $4.4 million Program grant to Russell Gruen and Sally Green to study the outcomes of brain injury.School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine | 3 Several of our senior staff were included in the successful application to establish the new $26 million Institute for Safety, Compensation and Recovery Research, a partnership among Monash University, WorkSafe Victoria and the Transport Accident Commission. This institute will have close links with our school and is expected to be the source of many collaborative research projects. Publications The media showed significant interest in several of our research studies. Paul O'Brien and his colleagues at the Centre for Obesity Research and Education found that recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients who underwent lapband surgery had a substantial reduction in lifetime healthcare costs. In the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Rachelle Buchbinder published a study evaluating the effectiveness of bone cement osteoporotic fractures. In another NEJM study, the ANZICS group led by Steve Webb (from Perth) described the epidemiology of H1N1/09 influenza as measured by intensive care admissions. Henry Krum received extensive publicity for several studies involving a new surgical technique to reduce high blood pressure and Charles Livingstone received extensive publicity for his work on gambling. We continue to publish several high profile newsletters, including the Australian Patient Safety Bulletin and Health Stream, a newsletter summarising new information on water and health that is widely circulated internationally. Our NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Patient Safety continued its successful seminar series examining issues of safety and quality of care. Teaching The year was also eventful on the teaching front. Under the direction of Helen Keleher and Brian Oldenburg, extensive planning was undertaken for a new and redeveloped program for the Bachelor of Health Science degree that will become the flagship undergraduate course of the School. The degree is intended to produce public health practitioners and provide an entry into a variety of other postgraduate degrees, including medicine. It has been co-developed with a similar course to be conducted at Monash South Africa. Redevelopment of the course was facilitated by the move of the Department of Health Social Science from the Peninsula campus to the Caulfield campus where we now have a substantial base of activity. The School also assumed the coordination the Victorian Public Health Training Program. This is coordinated by Robert Hall on behalf of the Victorian Department of Health wand provides public health training for a selected group of students who will graduate with a Doctorate of Public Health. The program consists of a mix of coursework and research and involves research placements from a variety of Victorian public health organisations. There were 10 students enrolled in 2009, five of whom had transferred from the previous course at La Trobe University and five were new enrolees.Staff During the year several of our staff and students were recognised with a variety of individual awards. Helena Teede received the Minister's award for outstanding individual achievement at the 2009 Victorian Public Healthcare Awards ceremony. Jamie Cooper received the Dean's award for research excellence while Helen Walls was awarded a prize for the best student presentation at the Australasian Epidemiology Association conference in Dunedin, New Zealand. In the annual promotion round, Karin Leder, Wendy Brown and Leanna Darvall were promoted to Associate Professor while Anita Wluka and Helena Teede were each awarded NHMRC Career Development Awards. In sport, Hendrik Zimmet (with colleague Larry Cohen) was Australia's first medal winner at the Maccabah games in Israel winning a bronze medal. Hendrik was also seventh in his category in the triathlon event. I would also like to make special mention of our doctoral program that has continued to flourish under the expert direction of Elizabeth Douglas and Rory Wolfe. During the year, 65 students were enrolled and nine graduated. During the year we said farewell to several staff and students who moved to new careers. In particular, I would like to recognise the excellent work of Max de Courten who left at the end of the year to take up a Chair in Public Health in Copenhagen. We also welcomed several new staff and adjunct appointees. Associate Professor Allen Cheng who joined the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Unit bringing his skills in mathematical modelling to the School. Megan Brooks took up the role of research governance coordinator taking over from Brad Crammond. Finally, I would also like to thank many others for their contributions to our activities. I am particularly grateful to Julia Veitch who managed our communications with great skill. Thanks also to our wonderful administrative team who managed the many activities needed to keep the School afloat during the year. I would also like to express great thanks to the senior staff of the School whose talent and dedication have yet again helped us though every challenge. John McNeil4 | SPHPM Annual Report 2009Highlights ASPREE grows into a major international trial The ASPREE (ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) project has increased its total funding from $3.5M (initial NHMRC grant) to more than $60 million. This extra money comes from both local and international sources. The project has now grown to become a large-scale international study. It provides a platform of opportunity for many secondary studies that will address important questions related to diseases of the elderly and healthy ageing. In September 2009, the funding of the ASPREE study by the National Institute on Aging (NIA; one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), US) was announced. The funding was for the joint Principal Investigators, Professor John McNeil (SPHPM, Monash University) and Professor Richard Grimm (Berman Center for Outcomes Research in Minneapolis, US) for US$50 million for seven years. Bayer Schering Pharma will also provide around $3 million of in-kind support for aspirin and the matching placebo. The primary aim of ASPREE is to determine whether regular low dose aspirin prolongs disability free survival in an ageing population. The study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. ASPREE will look at the influence of aspirin on the incidence of cardiovascular disease, dementia and common malignancies. This study will have the potential to inform clinical practice for the majority of those 70 and over who are free of vascular disease, dementia and physical disability.The ASPREE project's sub-studies such as the Healthy Ageing Biobank, which is run in collaboration with the CSIRO. Another sub-study is the ENVISion (Elderly: a Neuro-Vascular Imaging Study) neuroimaging project that has attracted NHMRC funding. This will be the largest Australian clinical trial for primary prevention conducted entirely in General Practice. Evidence of the importance of the project is the high calibre of the current sponsoring organisations - NHMRC, CSIRO and NIH. How will ASPREE work? Important to the success of this funding award was a series of modifications required to the original ASPREE protocol, primarily to incorporate the US collaborating sites. As part of the requirement for NIH funding support, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of US experts in a range of fields appropriate to oversee the study was constituted by the NIA. At the end of 2009, the DSMB confirmed the new joint Australia-US ASPREE protocol. ASPREE will recruit a total of 19,000 healthy participants aged 70 years of age and above (12,500 from Australia and 6,500 from the US). Over the next two and a half years, current metropolitan and regional sites in Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT will actively recruit ASPREE participants as well as General Practitioners (GPs) as co-investigators. Active recruitment to ASPREE had to be curtailed during 2009 pending the outcome of the NIH grant award and the DSMB approval of the protocol. School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine | 5 ASPREE: an important opportunity for regional Victoria Although ASPREE is a major international trial, it will serve as a spearhead to build clinical trial capacity in regional Victoria, supported by funding from the Victorian Cancer Agency (VCA). It will encourage participation by healthy elderly Victorians living in regional and rural Victoria in a major publicly-funded clinical research program. An earlier 12 month grant from the VCA supported the establishment of a Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) in collaboration with the University of Melbourne Rural Clinical School in Shepparton. This CTU is now recruiting for ASPREE and Biobank. Further CTUs are planned in collaboration with Monash Clinical Schools in Bendigo and Gippsland (Traralgon), with additional facilities to be developed in Ballarat and Warrnambool. These key regional study centres will be the focal point for patient recruitment, community engagement, data collection and laboratory testing. The research personnel trained as part of this program and the infrastructure built for clinical trials will underpin future research outside the metropolitan area. This will provide a Victoria-wide resource that will allow regional Victorians to participate in clinical research. An important feature of the ASPREE project in regional Victoria is the Seven-year duration of the funding as this will allow regional trial capacity to be developed in a sustainable fashion.Sub-studies of ASPREE give additional benefits to ageing research A major benefit of ASPREE is that studies into other aspects of ageing research can use data and specimens collected during ASPREE. A collaborative group will establish the ASPREE Healthy Ageing Biobank. This will focus on biomarkers for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease and stroke outcomes. The CSIRO Preventative Health Flagship Cluster collaboration has been set up with Monash University (as the lead university), Australian National University (ANU), Menzies Institute (Tasmania) and the University of Melbourne. The Biobank will collect baseline blood and urine specimens from 10,000 ASPREE participants. Stored samples will then be available for future investigation into novel predictors and diagnostics of diseases in the elderly. Factors that predispose to healthy ageing may also be discovered. A second substudy of ASPREE is ENVIS-ion. The neuroimaging sub-study of ASPREE will investigate the effects of aspirin treatment on retinal and cerebral vascular structure and cognitive function (NHMRC support of $1.27 million). ENVIS-ion will study 600 ASPREE participants in a continuing collaboration between Monash University and the ANU. New recruitment for ENVIS-ion was also placed on hold in 2009, pending the NIH and DSMB outcomes. The ENVIS-ion project in Canberra and Melbourne will be re-activated in 2010, with full recruitment expected within a year. 6 | SPHPM Annual Report 2009Victorian Bushfires Report The ability of staff at the School to respond to the Victorian Bushfires reflects our broad research areas across public health and preventative medicine. We were able to contribute to a number of phases of the response to the disaster, from the time immediately after the fires, to research over the ensuing months that recommend ways to strengthen Victoria's fire medical response systems. Immediate response The Department of Forensic Medicine participated in the Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) process. The department has an international reputation for its expertise in this area. Impact on individuals and the community. The Infectious Disease Epidemiology Unit incorporates the School's research activities in water quality. The unit provided expert advice on the effects of the bushfires on Victorian water catchment and the likely effects of 'run-off' of fire retardants on human health. (Health Stream, March 2009, Issue 53). The Monash Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health (MonCOEH) examined the influence of air pollution resulting from the bushfires and the incidence of cardiac arrest. Furthermore, they also examined the incidence of cancer among the operational full-time and auxiliary fire fighters. The five days preceding the Victorian bushfires were accompanied by a hot heatwave of unprecedented intensity creating a public health hazard, particularly for the elderly. The School's Centre for Research Excellence in Patient Safety (CREPS) completed a study for the Victorian Health department titled 'Reducing harm to older persons in Victoria from extreme hot weather'. Lessons learned The School's Critical Care Division examined and reported on the response of the Victorian State Trauma System. Recommendations were made about the handling of casualties. (Cameron P . et al. Black Saturday: the immediate impact of the February 2009 bushfires in Victoria, Australia. Medical Journal of Australia, 2009; 191(1), 11-16). Swine Flu Pandemic Report Australia was just entering winter when the WHO declared the influenza A (H1N1 2009) (also known as \"Swine Flu\") a pandemic. Staff from SPHPM contributed to the Australian and Victorian response to the crisis as well as providing expert advice to panels and committees analysing aspects of the crisis. Associate Professor Allen Cheng was involved in establishing a number of clinical studies early in the course of the pandemic, including the establishment of hospital-based surveillance and early reviews of the clinical features of the infection. Staff of the Infectious Diseases Unit contributed to the development of national clinical and infection control guidelines. A national hospital-based sentinel surveillance program (FluCAN) was established to provide real-time information on hospital admissions due to influenza. A study of quarantine measures in patients presenting to three Melbourne hospitals found that compliance with quarantine measures was good. However, the study also found that the clinical syndrome used to identify patients with influenza was imprecise, leading to many patients being placed in quarantine who were not confirmed to have influenza. Members of the Infectious Diseases Unit were involved in panels for the NHMRC and the Health research Council of New Zealand reviews. School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine | 7 Staff of the Transfusion Outcomes Research Collaborative and the Epidemiological Modelling Unit were involved in a project examining the potential impact of an influenza pandemic on the supply of blood and blood products. The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Research Centre (ANZIC-RC) coordinated a bi-national Influenza A registry, collecting information on every patient in Australia and New Zealand admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed influenza A (H1N1 2009). This culminated in an article in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. The article was a rapid publication to inform the northern hemisphere, prior to their winter, of the impending likely impact on intensive care services. (The ANZIC Influenza Investigators, Critical Care Services and 2009 H1N1 Influenza in Australia and New Zealand, The New England Journal of Medicine, 2009, 361, 1-10). Dr Robert Hall attended the Influenza Pandemic subcommittee of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization meeting on 7 July 2009 in Geneva. He was the Chair of the Regional Technical Advisory Group for Immunization and Vaccine-Preventable Diseases for the Western Pacific Region of WHO. The recommendations were published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record of 24 July 2009 (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, WER, 2009, 84: 301-305). Professor John McNeil was a member of the Therapeutic Good Administration's pharmacoepidemiology panel that monitored reports of adverse events associated with influenza vaccination.8 | SPHPM Annual Report 2009New Centres and Registries New Centres Centre for Public Health and Human Rights The Michael Kirby Centre for Public Health and Human Rights is an exciting collaboration of interdisciplinary scholars in Monash University's School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. The Centre is named for the former Justice of the High Court of Australia, a renowned human rights expert, advocate and defender who will maintain an active involvement in the Centre's work and future direction. The Centre was created to consolidate existing SPHPM capacities in the study of public health and human rights that have developed over 20 years. The Centre comprises activists, lawyers, scientists and ethicists who undertake research that critically examines the contribution of human rights and law to the realisation of good health, particularly in vulnerable communities in Australia and in the developing world. The Director is Associate Professor Bebe Loff, a scholar with some 30 years experience working at the intersection of law and health. When the HIV/AIDS epidemic emerged, Bebe played an integral role in the legal and policy response in Australia and internationally. Bebe was a community activist who, along with others including Ms Cheryl Overs (also of the Kirby Centre), established Australia's first Prostitutes' Collective. She has since worked with sex workers in many countries. The Centre aims to conduct research that informs the development of public health policies and programs in which human rights standards and norms are critically considered. The Centre will also undertake teaching programs that facilitate informed inquiry about public health, law and human rights. The current research, teaching and consultancy projects of the Kirby Centre include: investigating the ethical duties of health professionals in the care and treatment of asylum seekers in detention. This work has recently been shortlisted for a 2010 Eureka Prize; a collaboration with the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine to examine and document the role and contribution of forensic medical and nursing staff to the welfare of survivors of sexual assault; developing a reform strategy that addresses the local, national and international regulatory environments which promote obesity; investigating the attitudes of the Australian population about the protection of personal privacy when conducting health and medical research; examining the obligations of clinical researchers to disclose and manage conflicts of interest, particularly in their dealings with pharmaceutical companies; and exploring the testing of women for HIV in antenatal settings in Tamil Nadu, India. The Kirby Centre is a core partner of the Paulo Longo Research Initiative (PLRI). The PLRI aims to develop and consolidate ethical, interdisciplinary scholarship on sex work to encourage policy that helps improve the lives of men, women and transgender people who sell or buy sex. The other core partners are: the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), UK; the Centre for Advocacy on Stigma and Marginalisation (CASAM), India; and the Global Network of Sex Work Projects. PLRI projects led by the Kirby Centre include: the establishment of a legal service for Cambodian sex workers; and an investigation of the impact of laws and enforcement policies on sex workers in a number of countries. The Kirby Centre also performs postgraduate teaching. The Centre coordinates the Monash University Master of International Health and the Master of International Research Bioethics. The latter program is funded by the Fogarty Centre of the US National Institutes of Health to create expertise in research ethics, law and methodology in countries in the Asia-Pacific region in order to promote the ethical conduct of medical research in developing countries. School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine | 9 New Registries Australian Cardiac Procedures Registry (ACPR) A cardiac procedures registry is essential to ensure that patients receive the best possible treatment for their cardiac conditions. It helps patients to understand the risks and outcomes associated with different treatments so that they can make informed choices. It also enables clinicians to review their own practice and to make changes where necessary. These types of registries work by collecting clinical healthcare information about different treatments of particular diseases with a view to improving safety and quality. The Australian Cardiac Procedures Registry (ACPR) was developed through a project funded by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (ACSQHC). The pilot project ran from November 2008 to November 2009. The ACPR pilot project has led to a number of outcomes for quality of care and the provision of high-cost, high-risk cardiac services in Australia. A structure was developed for clinical leadership and for stakeholders to meaningfully engage in the process. In addition, a process was established through which standardised data can be collected via a secure web-based system that was developed and is operating according to regulatory standards.To achieve these results, the ACPR was established on the basis of the successful Australian Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons (ASCTS) registry and the Melbourne Interventional Group (MIG) registry, both of which had been developed in Victoria in the preceding decade. The ACPR project enabled in-depth examination of the principles and standards associated with quality clinical registries and how they relate to the capture of complex cardiac procedural data. The project identified barriers and challenges to the adoption and implementation of the principles and standards at individual hospitals. It also developed a framework from which the ACPR web-based registry was established for cardiac surgery, percutaneous cardiac intervention and implantable devices. This framework consists of a governance structure that includes leadership from the key clinical and surgical craft groups in Australia (the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ) and ASCTS) as well as key stakeholder funding and consumer representation. Initially, the ASCTS and MIG datasets were revised to provide the minimal data collection framework. This enabled capture of epidemiologically sound, minimal data sets for the complex area of cardiovascular interventions. The purposes of the data sets are to address the identified key performance indicators and to allow adequate risk adjustment. While the implantable device collection module does not yet include pacemakers, this was identified as a future component for development. In addition, the need to develop and implement percutaneous valve and cardiac defect closure device modules was also identified. 10 | SPHPM Annual Report 2009 Research and education summary School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (SPHPM), Monash University Research Research income: $23 million Year 2008 NHMRC research funding $10,213,383 Category 1 funding $11,419,862 Other research funding $10,109,432 Total: $21,529,294 Total number of research projects, scholarships and fellowships funded by grants in 2009.

There are many unanswered questions about the right balance between community-based programs and a targeted approach to those at high risk of disease. The cost effectiveness of many proposed interventions is unclear and, in some instances, long-term safety requires further study. Separating unwarranted enthusiasm from science is a major challenge for all researchers involved in this field. Our division of prevention science brings together units involved in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal disease, diabetes and obesity. The division also includes the Department of Forensic Medicine, a part of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine. Here, a major focus is on analysing deaths reported to the Victorian coroner and using the information to prevent premature death in others. The Department of Health Social Science brings its expertise in community-based health promotion programs to add to the breadth of skill within the division. Research activities investigate primary, secondary and tertiary prevention strategies. Another major focus is the prevention of disability among those already affected by early disability. Studies that are currently underway include the ASPirin for Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial (see page [insert page number]), a program to evaluate outcomes of bariatric surgery, and epidemiological studies modelling the future impact of obesity and other lifestyle challenges. Experienced researchers in the division can access the full range of the clinical and public health skills required for active and successful evaluations. Department of Forensic Medicine (DFM) The Department of Forensic Medicine (DFM) is the only university department in Australia to be set up in parallel with a forensic medical service facility. It therefore operates as both a publicly-funded institution and an academic unit. This unique arrangement has arguably contributed more to forensic medicine and the allied forensic sciences than any other facility in this country. Many of our staff are world leaders in their disciplines and this has contributed to an international reputation for excellence. Since its inception 21 years ago, the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine together with the DFM has produced many significant research findings that have contributed to prevention of injury and death and to public health. It also has developed a significant postgraduate teaching output, with postgraduate courses in forensic medicine producing 62 graduates over 10 years. There have been almost 50 Bachelor of Science (honours) and Bachelor of Medical Science graduates, and almost 20 postgraduate degrees by research including PhD, many of whom have remained with us and work at the Institute. There have been over 500 publications in this time covering a variety of themes related to disciplines encompassing forensic medicine. School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine | 13 The recent reorganisation of the executive team of the Institute was designed, in part, to enhance the role of the DFM and increase its profile. This strategy helps align the Institute with changes in the Coroner's Act that increase the prevention focus of death investigations. Indeed at its inception in 1988, the Government believed that the Institute and its connection with the DFM was an 'investment in public health'. The Centre for Obesity Research and Education (CORE) The Centre for Obesity Research and Education (CORE) aims to better understand obesity, obesity-related diseases and the associated psychosocial conditions. Research focuses on identifying optimal methods for the safe, cost-effective, long-term management of obesity, coupled with developing preventive strategies that can be implemented in the community. The Centre conducts active programs in clinical, basic science and public health research and engages in many collaborations, nationally and internationally. Through its close association with a major clinical obesity treatment program at the Centre for Bariatric Surgery, CORE has become the foremost research group in the world for studying the health benefits of weight loss. Research has been published extensively in leading journals over the past seven years. To date, the number of publications stands at over 100 papers. Clinical Epidemiology Clinical Epidemiology is the application of epidemiological methods to the care of individual patients. The Division was formed in 2009 to bring together the School's research interests in cardiovascular disease prevention and therapeutics, respiratory and musculoskeletal epidemiology, infectious diseases, women's health and research synthesis and translation. The component units and centres are located at the Alfred, Cabrini and Monash Medical Centre. Most of the unit heads have clinical appointments at one of these hospitals.Jean Hailes Clinical Research Unit The Jean Hailes Clinical Research Unit is affiliated with both Monash University and Southern Health and sits within the SPHPM. The integrated research team focuses on the continuum of adverse lifestyle, obesity, insulin resistance, insulin-resistant syndromes including metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), gestational diabetes, pre-diabetes, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Progression through this continuum is not inevitable. The research team's focus is on both mechanisms of prevention and the translation of evidence to optimise prevention. The Unit also conducts an extensive menopause research program. The Jean Hailes Clinical Research Unit maintains an independent approach to research and undertakes single centre studies as well as collaborating locally, nationally and internationally in projects with other research organisations. As part of The Jean Hailes Foundation for Women's Health, the research team works closely with the Education Unit to translate the latest research findings into practical health and lifestyle approaches for women and their health professionals. The team also has skills in evidence synthesis and appraisal. Our research interests focus on areas that impact the quality of life and longevity of women. The strength of our research program lies in our ability to produce solid results and focus on community health outcomes, in an environment that fosters quality research. 14 | SPHPM Annual Report 2009The Australasian Cochrane Centre The Cochrane Collaboration is an international, independent organisation of over 28,000 contributors from more than 100 countries. It is dedicated to making up-to-date information about the effects of health care readily available worldwide. Our contributors work together to produce systematic reviews of healthcare interventions, known as Cochrane reviews, which are published in The Cochrane Library. The Australasian Cochrane Centre co-ordinates Cochrane activities in Australia and the wider region. This is achieved mainly by providing training and support to authors of Cochrane reviews, working with policy makers, advocating on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration in our region, and promoting the use and uptake of The Cochrane Library. The Centre works in partnership with its branches in New Zealand, Korea, Singapore and Thailand. There are over 1900 authors of Cochrane reviews in Australia, mostly comprising clinicians, researchers and consumers who contribute on a voluntary basis. The Centre conducts regular workshops for new authors on how to prepare Cochrane reviews, as well as more intensive programs for those completing a review. Our role extends to co-ordinating the Collaboration's overall training program.The Department of Health and Ageing funds the Centre and the national subscription to The Cochrane Library. Our work with policy makers is particularly focused on ensuring that evidence in the form of systematic reviews underpins policy and is made available in formats that policy makers can use. The Centre is aligned with core Cochrane activities and has an extensive program of research that explores effective ways to inform healthcare decisions through the uptake of evidence. This includes projects investigating the synthesis, interpretation, dissemination and implementation of research evidence for clinical practice and policy. Cardiovascular Prevention Research Unit Major achievements for 2009 involved large-scale clinical trials and collaborative public health research. The Unit also provided leadership for the LIPID study (NHMRC grant). This study has completed an average of 16 years of follow-up of 9014 coronary heart disease patients from 87 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Analyses of biomarkers will predict recurrent cardiovascular events and possible new therapeutic targets. The Unit is also working with spatial geographers (ARC grant) to map the availability of necessary medical services for those in Australia's 20,000 population centres who are at risk of an acute cardiac event. These findings will be used to develop new strategies to overcome access barriers. Centre of Cardiovascular Research and Education in Therapeutics (CCRET) The mission of Centre of Cardiovascular Research and Education in Therapeutics (CCRET) is to improve clinical outcomes for individuals and communities. This is achieved by analysing evidence based on high-quality clinical research. In 2009, CCRET led a pivotal and highly successful study into the treatment of hypertension that cannot be properly controlled with drug treatment. The study evaluated the novel strategy of renal denervation to help patients with this condition. The exciting outcomes of this study were presented at a late-breaking clinical trials session of the American College of Cardiology meeting in March 2009. The Chronic Heart Failure Assisted by Telephone (CHAT) study also received a late-breaking trials session at the European Heart Failure Association. This was a randomised control trial of telephone support for chronic heart failure patients at the risk of rehospitalisation. The SCReening Evaluation of the Evolution of New Heart Failure (SCREEN-HF) study recruited over 4000 patients in the initial cohort study leading to further funding for a longitudinal and interventional study. School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine | 15 Respiratory Epidemiology Group (REG) A Respiratory Epidemiology Group (REG) trial was designed to look at ways of improving management and intervention by GPs of patients with chronic respiratory diseases, like asthma (SPIRO-GP). SPIRO-GP was a randomised controlled trial of spirometry in general practice that was completed in 2009. The Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) study was undertaken in collaboration with the Woolcock Institute in Sydney and other centres around Australia (NHMRC funding). We are also collaborating with the University of Melbourne on two large NHMRC supported cohort studies: the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) and the Melbourne Atopic Cohort Study (MACS). Monash Department of Clinical Epidemiology (Cabrini Hospital) In 2009, a study from the Department was published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. The results of a 6-month randomised placebo-controlled trial showed that vertebroplasty (injection of bone cement into painful acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures) was not an effective treatment. The Department also manages the Australian Rheumatology Association Database (ARAD) that collects long-term data on the effectiveness and safety of biologic therapy for inflammatory arthritis and is an editorial base of the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group (CMSG). We collaborate with several Australian researchers in the Global Burden of Disease 2005 project to determine the burden of arthritis and back pain and also collaborate with Deakin University researchers to develop new ways to measure health literacy and the overall burden of back pain. Our work on developing and validating the Evaluative Linguistic Framework (ELF) won the Arthritis Victoria inaugural Helen Moran Award. The ELF is a tool to improve the quality of written information about medication that is given to the patient. The achievements of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Unit, Jean Hailes Clinical Research Unit and Australasian Cochrane Centre can be found elsewhere in this report.Health Services and Global Health Research The Division is concerned with a diverse range of issues that influence the effective, efficient and ethical delivery of health services, locally and across the globe.

Our students have practical opportunities to apply their knowledge to health problems in Victoria and beyond. Our vision is for all our graduates to have a strong sense of civic engagement and a commitment to public health, healthy public policy and the health and well-being of all people and their communities, whether in Australia or in countries overseas. Occupational and Environmental Health The occupational and environmental division is made up of three main units: The Monash Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health (MonCOEH), The Australian Centre for Human Health Risk Assessment (ACHHRA) and Infectious Disease Epidemiology Unit. A diverse research program includes several occupational cohort studies of chronic diseases in petroleum workers, aluminium industry workers, orchardists, lead workers, asbestos cement workers, firefighters, nurses and military veterans. The main research activities involve occupational disease surveillance, respiratory and cardiac effects of small particles and other air pollutants, occupational health and safety aspects of occupational light vehicle use, the health effects of mobile phone use, workplace health promotion, nanotechnology, methods of exposure assessment, water quality and public health, environmental impacts on infections, travellers' health, health issues in immigrants/ refugees, and infectious disease transmission modelling. The division has studies of infectious diseases such as influenza and infections associated with treatment in a hospital or medical unit. These represent important problems in clinical practice. In 2009, we assisted government agencies to set or review environmental health standards. We have also assisted with peer-review of reports developed by regulatory agencies. There are a number of project highlights. Revision of the seminal 2002 enHealth guidance document on environmental health risk assessment. Assisting the Queensland Government with the health risk assessment (HRA) component of the Clean-Air-for-Gladstone project and providing expertise on the Expert Panel advising on the South East Queensland Recycled Water Project. Preparation of a literature summary on the toxicology of six nanomaterials of interest to the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS), the Australian regulator of industrial chemicals. Assisting the Cooperative Research Centre for Contamination Assessment and Remediation of the Environment (CRC-CARE) in its Australian Remediation Industry Cluster program (ARIC) and with a project developing Health Screening Levels (HSLs) for sites contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. Participation in various expert committees of Australian government agencies and in a community consultative committee for cleaning up the Botany industrial site in Sydney. The division has many national and international research collaborators and is a research hub for the Institute for Safety, Compensation and Recovery Research. It also has an active PhD program, runs regular short courses and offers several postgraduate courses in occupational and environmental health. The division has strong collaborative links in the Asia-Pacific region including Thailand, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine | 17 Critical Care Research The Critical Care Research Division investigates improvements to patient care from the pre-hospital phase through the emergency department and operating theatre to the intensive care unit (ICU). Lead Investigators manage large national and international trials to improve outcomes for critically ill patients with conditions as diverse as cardiac arrest, head injury and sepsis. We also monitor the overall improvements in the management of critically ill patients through state and national databases. This has allowed benchmarking of clinical outcomes at a national and international level. The research group has had a particular emphasis on building capacity in critical care research through the training of clinical leaders in research. Doctoral and postdoctoral training schemes are strongly supported within the School. Our resources and linkages allow access to a variety of specialised patient groups including those in the pre-hospital phase, emergency departments, ICUs and anaesthesia. We are home to the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trial Centre (ANZICS-CTG, linking ICU's across Australia) the Anaesthesia Trials Network and the Monash Centre for Therapeutics Research and Education. Our resources include one of Australia's most advanced data management units capable of handling tens of thousands of clinical records. The centre has extensive capacity in web-based data entry, real-time feedback of results, quality control procedures and high-level data security.Health Research Methodology The Division of Health Research Methodology consists of Units providing the methodological foundation underpinning most of the research conducted within the SPHPM. It brings together the areas of Biostatistics, Epidemiological Modelling, Clinical Informatics and Data Management, and Research Governance. Activities incorporate methodological and technological development and implementation to enable high quality research to be conducted within the School. It also provides a rigorous framework for appropriate and ethical conduct of research. Staff of the Biostatistics Unit are involved in the development of new statistical analytical methods to solve practical problems arising in clinical and epidemiological research. They also extensively collaborate on research projects inside and outside the School and provide a biostatistical consulting service to the University and external clients. The Unit runs a range of teaching and short course activities, varying from basic concepts and methods for clinical researchers to mathematically-based advanced biostatistical theory and methods. Epidemiological modelling involves the analysis of existing trends and data patterns of burdens of disease. This enables the prediction of the likely needs for health care resources and the effectiveness of different approaches to disease prevention. Research in these areas provides a foundation for developing costed options for policy makers and for decision-making frameworks for general practitioners and their patients about lifestyle changes that improve health outcomes. The Clinical Informatics and Data Management Unit (CIDMU) has extensive capacity in data management for the conduct of large-scale national and international multi-centre clinical trials, registries, occupational cohorts and health surveys. Staff in the unit possess expertise in all aspects of data collection and data management, including forms design, web-based data capture, entry and randomisation services, data validation and quality control. Consulting services for data management are provided to external clients. CIDMU staff also train SPHPM researchers in the principles of database design and management. Research governance is the framework by which institutions support, monitor and attest to the safety, ethical acceptability and quality of the research they undertake. The Research Governance Unit has developed and implemented a framework which is underpinned by four components: a risk management plan; publication of guidelines for responsible conduct of research; training and education of staff and students; and formation of a School Research Governance Committee to oversee these aspects.

The Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences administers these programs centrally, at the Clayton Campus. The SPHPM manages the Bachelor of Health Science (BHSc) and Bachelor of Health Science/Bachelor of Social Work degrees which are delivered from the Caulfield campus. Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery Theme 2, Population, Society, Health, and Illness, of the MBBS program equips medical students with the knowledge, skills and values to enable them to deal with broad social and population issues relevant to their work after graduation. The theme comprises 15 per cent of the overall undergraduate medical curriculum and is taught by staff from SPHPM, the Department of General Practice and the Centre for Health Economics. Medical students learn the basics of public health in first year, health promotion in second year, and evidence-based practice and occupational and environmental health in third year. In fourth year, medical students learn the essentials of health services management. The School provides opportunities for students to undertake a public health elective in their fifth year. The unit about evidence-based clinical practice equips students with the skills to identify, appraise and integrate the best available evidence into their clinical training and practice. Health promotion and knowledge management introduces students to community-based organisations caring for people, and the place of health promotion in modern health care. Students undertake a research project as part of this unit. This is their first taste of the role that research has in developing an evidence base for practice. The occupational medicine program fosters interest in a doctor's role in the health of workers. The prime focus is fitness, return to work and concerns about health and work. The program features a special examination for the John Desmond Prize. A total of 305 students elected to sit for this prize. Wei Ping Yew (Malaysia) won first prize ($1000), Chien Yew Kow (Malaysia) second ($300), and Yu En Chia, Aiman Ahmad (Malaysia), Ahmad Mohd Soffi, Chau Wang Ng (Monash Medical Centre, Clayton) equal third ($150 each). The environmental medicine program concerns a doctor's role where environmental factors (other than work) aggravate or cause illness. The medical program is taught in many different and widely separate sites, which presents a challenge, particularly in fourth year. Much of the School's teaching is conducted online, to enable equity of access for all students. The School plays a major role in planning and oversight of the content of Theme 2, with colleagues from the Clayton, Gippsland and Kuala Lumpur campuses. Undergraduate and Graduate Entry Medical Law Programs This year the Institute of Forensic Medicine (with the Department of Forensic Medicine, Monash University) successfully delivered the medical law tutorial program. This is an examinable component of the undergraduate medical curriculum at Monash University, Clayton. Associate Professor Leanna Darvall, in a position jointly funded by Avant and the Medical Indemnity Protection Society (MIPS), coordinates over 70 medical lawyers and clinicians who provide small group tutorials for students in years one, three and four of the MBBS course. The program takes a collaborative approach, including having tutorials in third year delivered jointly by lawyers and clinicians at metropolitan and regional hospital sites. A number of Department of Forensic Medicine staff are involved in program delivery including Drs Noel Woodford, Shelley Robertson, Matthew Lynch and Associate Professor David Ranson. A graduate-entry medical degree was offered at the Churchill campus. The medical law component of the Gippsland program is delivered as a multi-disciplinary seminar series in each year of the graduate-entry program involving medical lawyers, ethicists and clinicians, many of whom are also engaged in delivery of the Clayton program. Associate Professor Darvall has also assisted with the development of a medical law program for Monash Malaysia that mirrors the format of the Clayton and Gippsland programs. Bachelor of Biomedical Science The School teaches two units of the BBiomedSc program, including one core unit, Biomedical Sciences and Society; and one elective unit, Introduction to the Health System. When they graduate, students can choose from a variety of careers, so we aim to stimulate their interest in population health. They learn foundation concepts in epidemiology and public health, including how health is maintained and illness is controlled at local, regional and national levels. School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine | 39 Honours program We welcome enquiries from students considering Honours. Enquiries can be directed to Dr Anna Peeters on 03 9903 0177 or at anna.peeters@monash.edu. The Bachelor of Medical Science (BMedSc) and BBiomedSc (Hons) are diverse programs. The BMedSc is a research year within the undergraduate medical course. The BBiomedSc honours year is open to BBiomedSc graduates with sufficient grades from the undergraduate BBiomedSc course. BBiomedSc (Hons) and BMedSc students in SPHPM participate in classes in epidemiology and biostatistics, the cornerstones of medical research. They also complete research supervised by researchers within the department and become proficient in presenting their results at departmental seminars. A variety of Honours projects were available to students in 2009: Biostatistical methods in epidemiological research; Claire Weedon and Brodwen McBain. Bachelor of Health Science and Bachelor of Health Science/Bachelor of Social Work The BHSc is a three-year public health program which includes core units for foundation learning, stream units for specialization and electives for breadth. All students are expected to develop sound research skills. Core units include foundations of health, research, global health, anatomy and physiology, health systems, epidemiology, health promotion, health programs, policy, and disease prevention. The two specialisation streams are Clinical and Public Health Sciences, and Health Programs and Policy. Students are encouraged to undertake a semester of Study Abroad. In 2009, 60 students were enrolled. The course is supported by a range of community partnerships nurtured by staff in the Department of Health Social Science. These partnerships enable student practicum opportunities and bring real-world experience to their learning. The BHSc/BSW is a four-year double degree that gives students a two-year health science context for their social work degree. The health science component concentrates on areas including health promotion, programs and policy, and community partnerships. In 2009, 30 students were enrolled. One BHSc/BSW student, Marama Kufi, has established the South Eastern Oromo Community Health Team, which takes a health promotion approach to the issues of mental health, family relationships, domestic violence, drug and alcohol use and the relationships between young people and their families. Chaired by Mr Kufi, it is a collaboration between the Oromo community, Monash University, and the Cardinia-Casey and Greater Dandenong Community Health Services. Another BHSc/BSW student, Sarai Dee, won a coveted Oxfam-Monash internship in 2009, to undertake volunteer work in Oxfam's human rights and HIV/AIDS campaigns in South Africa for two months. 40 | SPHPM Annual Report 2009Teaching - Postgraduate The Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine (VIFM) ran two postgraduate courses in forensic medicine: Master of Forensic Medicine Program; and Forensic Nursing. The program continues to attract national and international students. In 2009, 55 students were enrolled in the various programs. These students were from all Australian states and territories and from overseas. The Graduate Certificate of Nursing (Forensic) course had 20 students enrolled, of which 16 nursing students were offered scholarships (Qld 15, Vic 1, Tas 3, NSW 1). The DEPM postgraduate program is extensive and offers the following courses: Masters in Public Health; Biostatistics; Clinical Epidemiology / Clinical Research Methods; Health Services Management; International Health; and Occupational and Environmental Health. DEPM's postgraduate courses attract students from a wide range of medical and allied health backgrounds, including medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, pharmacy and health management. During 2009, DEPM's postgraduate courses had 427 students enrolled, with 220 of these studying the Master of Public Health (MPH). Enrolment in postgraduate courses in 2009 Course Title Number of Students Enrolled Masters in Public Health 220 Biostatistics 17 Clinical Epidemiology/Clinical Research Methods 21 Health Services Management 88 International Health 45 Occupational and Environmental Health36 Total 427 School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine | 41 Master of Public Health (MPH) The MPH provides students with the full range of quantitative, analytical and communication skills necessary to work in public health. We are a partner in the Victorian Consortium for Public Health, which is a collaboration between Deakin, La Trobe, Melbourne and Monash Universities. In 2009, Monash University continued its responsibility for this course and Ms Joy Markwell worked as the consortium's administrative coordinator. Through the Victorian Consortium for Public Health, we offer specialisation streams for students enrolled in this course through Monash. These streams are clinical epidemiology, environmental health, health economics, health services management, international health, occupational health and environmental health. The MPH is studied in two parts. In part one, students from the four member universities study together. In 2009, the core units were: Epidemiology and demography; Introductory statistics; and Research methods/field methods for international health planning and evaluation. In part two of the MPH, students study with their university of enrolment. In this part the students select and focus on specialised streams. Course Coordinator - Professor Flavia Cicuttini. Biostatistics The Graduate Certificate and Graduate Diploma in Biostatistics give a broad range of biostatistical theory and techniques especially designed for health professionals. The Master of Biostatistics develops the technical skills needed to commence a professional career as a biostatistician. Course coordinator - Associate Professor Andrew Forbes. Clinical Epidemiology/Clinical Research Methods The Graduate Certificate in Clinical Research Methods is an off-campus course with some on-site block requirements. This degree guides students through the many stages required for undertaking research and includes introductory subjects in biostatistics, epidemiology and study design. The Graduate Diploma in Clinical Research Methods assists clinicians or public health professionals to become familiar with clinical research methodology. It assists health professionals to make rational evidence-based decisions in clinical practice and to undertake clinical audits and small clinical research projects. It can lead to the Master of Clinical Epidemiology or Master of Public Health. The Master of Clinical Epidemiology is offered as an off-campus or on-campus course, and may be undertaken either part-time or full-time. This may include elective subjects in infectious diseases, injury prevention and epidemiology, health promotion and advanced statistical methods. It provides a solid basis in clinical research for health professionals who participate in investigator-initiated or industry-supported studies, including doctors, research nurses and allied health professionals. Course coordinator - Associate Professor Allen Cheng. Health Services Management The Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma and Masters in Health Services Management are off-campus, part-time or full-time courses. The Masters degree caters for medical or general hospital administrators, clinicians, quality assurance managers, team leaders, senior nursing administrators, unit managers and case managers within the health care system. Course coordinator - Professor Just Stoelwinder. Occupational and Environmental Health The Graduate Certificate in Occupational Health, Graduate Diploma and Masters in Occupational and Environmental Health are off-campus, part- or full-time courses offered by the Monash Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health (MonCOEH) at DEPM. Course coordinator - Professor Malcolm Sim. International Health The Graduate Diploma in International Health and Master of International Health are offered in collaboration with the Centre for International Health at the Burnet Institute. It provides students with the skills to design, implement and evaluate relevant programs that address the major public health priorities of communities in developing countries. The Graduate Certificate and Masters in International Research Bioethics deal with ethical issues that arise in healthcare settings, in vulnerable populations and in international settings. Particular emphasis is given to ethical issues associated with research in developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Course coordinator - Associate Professor Bebe Loff.42 | SPHPM Annual Report 2009Master of Forensic Medicine Program This program offers medical practitioners an opportunity to develop advanced knowledge and skills in clinical forensic medicine. In addition to units offered by the Department of Forensic Medicine, students have the opportunity to complete relevant units from other tertiary institutions. After satisfactory completion of the three core units and one elective unit, students may exit the program with a Graduate Certificate of Forensic Medicine. This is usually one year of part-time study. To continue in the Master's program, students must complete the core units to honours level. Should the students gain 48 credit points, they may exit the program with a Graduate Diploma in Forensic Medicine. This is usually two years of part-time study. The full Master's program requires 72 university credit points, which equates to at least three years of part-time study. Generally, part-time study is considered to be two units per semester, however, students may complete two or three units per year if they wish. Core units will be offered yearly. Elective units may be offered either annually or on alternate years. The availability of elective units is dependent on minimum enrolment numbers. All students will be required to attend a program of formal teaching and assessment that involves face-to-face teaching. This will be over a period of one to two weeks, with approximately two days allocated for each unit. Residential arrangements will be the responsibility of the student. The course administrator will provide assistance with these arrangements for overseas candidates. Course coordinator - Associate Professor David Wells. Forensic Nursing This course aims to assist those with an interest in pursuing professional development in the area of forensic nursing. Areas covered are: forensic knowledge and nursing responsibilities in forensic cases; clinical consultations with victims of crime and offenders; medico-legal report writing and provision of evidence in court; theoretical and cultural aspects of interpersonal violence. The course comprises four core units including: sexual assault nursing 1 and 2; understanding injuries; and nursing and the criminal justice system. Course coordinator - Dr Angela Williams.
