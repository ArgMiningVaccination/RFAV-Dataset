The mind body approach to therapy is different, it is not about changing behaviors or thoughts. Since the correct answer is always within you, it's about reconnecting to the innate wisdom within the body. Trauma can interfere with your ability to interpret your body's wisdom. Connecting back into your internal body is effortless, as you were born to do it, but it does require practice. In workshops and sessions, you will learn why it is important to communicate with the body, how to support the body, acknowledge the uncomfortable sensations and interpreting your body's need to feel safe again. The stored trauma creating tension in your body will release, the unconscious worrying and fear in your mind will subside, and you will feel empowered to be the best version of yourself. Mind Body Healing Services Every BODY experiences healing differently, in different circumstances, and with many different supports. I believe we should not heal alone. We should have a tribe around us to support our healing and growth. I believe we should not heal alone.
