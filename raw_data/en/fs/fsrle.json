The conference will feature a free screening of The Greater Good, an award-winning documentary that exposes vaccine risks, and several lectures about how to strengthen the immune system naturally.

The Weston A.

Price Foundation, will take place November 13-16 at the Anaheim Marriott, 770 West Convention Way, in Anaheim, California .
