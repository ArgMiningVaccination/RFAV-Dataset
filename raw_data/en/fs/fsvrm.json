The word naturopathy is a Latin-Greek hybrid which can be defined as 'being close to or benefiting from nature.'\" Stewart Mitchell, Naturopathy: Understanding the Healing Power of Nature. All disease is a \"lack of ease\" or lack of homeostasis in the body. What allopathic (medical) doctors call diseases are only symptoms of a greater underlying problem. Disease is nothing more than a manifestation of our bodies trying to correct imbalances. Our body tells us early on when there is a problem, and we can either respond to these \"messages\" or try to suppress the symptoms the body uses to tell us there is a problem. Eventually, if the underlying problem has not been addressed, the body will begin to break down structurally. A Doctorate of Traditional Naturopathy specializes in wellness. Teaching clients how applying all natural lifestyle approaches that act to facilitate the body's own natural healing and health building potential. Doctorates of Traditional Naturopathy are trained based on Dr. Lust's standardization of Naturopathy. They are not Naturopathic Medical Doctors NMD, who receive some allopathic training as well. They not replace the role of any Primary Care Physician nor undertakes to \"diagnose\" or \"treat diseases,\" or \"prescribe\", but rather recognizes that most sub-health conditions are cumulative lifestyle and environmental effects, and that the underlying cause of what we call \"disease\" is improper diet, unhealthy habits or choices, pathogenic infections, energetic imbalances, bodily system imbalances, and other environmental factors which cause biological imbalances leading to a weakening of the body's natural defenses and subsequent breakdown in health. Modern medicine is finally capable of diagnosing something which is really wrong and offers interventions to fix the structure, but still the underlying issue can often be overlooked. Naturopathy concentrates on identifying destructive aspects of lifestyle and environmental influences in the early phases, when changes can occur to bring long-term benefit. A Doctorate of Traditional Naturopathy does not concentrate on naming diseases but rather on identifying those underlying factors, which if not addressed, will eventually result in the manifestation of disease and illness. These factors can be identified and corrected long before it is even possible to make any diagnosis in the Allopathic field. Even after a diagnosis is made by a Primary Care Physician, the same concepts of healing used by a Doctorate of Traditional Naturopathy can be equally effective, and or compliment, because once balance is restored the body has the greatest potential to heal itself!

The practice of Traditional Naturopathy is recognized as a common occupation at the Federal level (U.S. Congress 1928, 1929, 1930 and 30 Federal Court rulings between 1958 and 1978) and as such it is a profession protected under the 14th and 9th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Several states have also made this stipulation either by statute or in the Courts. Congress found in the Congressional record 1931 DC, that Naturopathy was not Allopathic or Medicine. Naturopathy was not the use of drugs or surgery. "}
