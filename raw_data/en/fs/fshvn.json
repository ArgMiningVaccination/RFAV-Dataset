An autoimmune disorder occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy tissue. This condition causes inflammation, swelling, and irritation in blood vessels and other tissues. This inflammation reduces or stops the flow of blood to organs in the body. The condition mostly affects the respiratory system. This includes the sinuses, nose, windpipe, and lungs. It may also affect the kidneys, or it can damage any organ in the body. What causes granulomatosis with polyangiitis? The exact cause of GPA is unknown. It's not hereditary or contagious.

Certain infections are more common among people with this condition. Antibiotics may be given to treat or prevent infection. - Plasmapheresis.
