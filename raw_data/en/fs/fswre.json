The body is actually in a constant state of detoxification. Little do we realise, our body is working every minute of every day to eliminate all of the elements we ingest that do not serve us. However, when the body is overburdened with a high amount of toxins due to the foods we eat and the environment we live in our detoxification function cannot keep up with the elimination of these toxins and that is when dis-ease manifests. Some symptoms that suggest a need for a detox include fatigue, poor immune function, constipation, acne, eczema, foggy brain, weight issues, body odour, headaches and musculoskeletal aches and pains. Through the power of fasting - the energy usually used for digestion is then diverted and used for healing and detoxification by removing unwanted bacteria, fat and any foreign invaders. There are so many reasons to actively assist your body's natural detox system as it supports weight loss, prevents heart disease, balances blood sugar levels, reduces inflammation & cravings, improves cognitive function and energy levels, as well as slowing or reversing the signs of aging through a process called autophagy. We are holistic interconnected beings and as we cleanse and purify the physical, there is also a transformation and letting go of the mental and emotional states. Fasting allows the body to rest, reset and brings awareness to the habits in your life that you may wish to let go of so that you may bring in a more positive lifestyle. Charles Eisenstein mentions in The Yoga of Eating: Transcending Diets and Dogma to Nourish the Natural Self; \"...the greatest challenges and benefits of fasting are psycho-spiritual. Fasting has dimensions far beyond what we usually label the physical, and it cleanses more than just the body. Because eating is such a convenient distraction, fasting puts us face to face with ourselves. ...Fasting is a meditation of the body.\" Detoxification begins with as little as skipping a meal, but to truly experience the power of the amazing benefits your body has the potential to achieve, it is recommended to extend this period for a prolonged state. The longer the fast, the better the results. This can often be difficult to manage at home as our mental psyche will kick in and begin to doubt the process and create excuses for breaking the fast. It can also be dangerous to do a fast without the guidance of a health professional as when all the toxins are being dumped into the bloodstream it is important that all of the major organs of elimination are open otherwise there will be a process known as 'autointoxication' a self-poisoning of the system.
