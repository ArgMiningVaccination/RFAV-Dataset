In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Prevnar 20 in pregnant women. Available data on Prevnar 20 administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. A developmental toxicity study was performed in female rabbits administered Prevnar 20 prior to mating and during gestation. The dose was 0.5 mL at each occasion (a single human dose is 0.5 mL). This study revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to Prevnar 20 (see Data). Data Animal Data In a developmental toxicity study, female rabbits were administered Prevnar 20 by intramuscular injection twice prior to mating (17 days and 4 days prior to mating) and twice during gestation (Gestation Days 10 and 24), 0.5 mL/rabbit/occasion (a single human dose). No adverse effects on pre-weaning development were observed. There were no vaccine-related fetal malformations or variations. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether Prevnar 20 is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of Prevnar 20 on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Prevnar 20 and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Prevnar 20 or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety of Prevnar 20 has been established in individuals 6 weeks through 17 years of age [see [Adverse Reactions (6.1)](#S6.1)]. The effectiveness of Prevnar 20 for the prevention of invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, has been established in individuals 6 weeks through 17 years of age [see [Clinical Studies (14.2)](#S14.2)]. The effectiveness of Prevnar 20 for the prevention of otitis media caused by serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F has been established in individuals 6 weeks through 5 years of age [see [Clinical Studies (14.1)](#S14.1)]. The effectiveness of Prevnar 20 in infants and children initiating vaccination at 7 months through 17 years of age and in children 15 months through 17 years of age previously vaccinated or incompletely vaccinated with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is supported by evidence from clinical studies in younger children who received a 4-dose series of Prevnar 20 and by evidence from clinical studies of catch-up vaccination with Prevnar 13 and Prevnar. The effectiveness of Prevnar 20 for the prevention of pneumonia has not been established in individuals younger than 18 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of Prevnar 20 in individuals younger than 6 weeks of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of Prevnar 20 recipients 18 years of age and older evaluated for safety in the 3 main clinical trials (N=4263), 26.7% (n=1138) were 65 years of age and older and 1.7% (n=72) were 80 years of age and older [see [Clinical Studies (14.2)](#S14.2)]. Prevnar 20 recipients 70 through 79 years of age and 80 years of age had lower OPA GMTs for all pneumococcal serotypes compared to Prevnar 20 recipients 18 through 49 years, 50 through 59, and 60 through 64 years of age "}
