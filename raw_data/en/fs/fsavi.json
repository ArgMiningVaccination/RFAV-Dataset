I arrived there with my back injured so bad I could barely walk. I was supposed to compete in a State Championship Bass tournament two weeks later, but I didn't see how I would be able to. I experienced a noticeable improvement after the first visit, and when the time came to do the tournament I was pain free. I was able to compete 8 hours standing on a boat for two days without even thinking about my back. I highly recommend you trust your back pain to him.\" - Dan F. ](https://www.facebook.com/essentialmb/reviews/) OUR ADDRESS 415 E.
