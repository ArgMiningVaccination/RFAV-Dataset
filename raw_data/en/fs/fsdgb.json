CALENDAR SUBJECT TO CHANGE. 6 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE GENERAL INFORMATION The Campus Wayne Community College's 175 acre main campus is located in Goldsboro, NC at 3000 Wayne Memorial Drive. Eleven modern buildings contain more than 360,000 square feet of state-of-the art classrooms, laboratories, offices, and a model childcare center. An aviation classroom and hanger are located at the Wayne Executive Jetport. In addition, curriculum and continuing education courses are offered at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base and various locations throughout Wayne County. The History A member of North Carolina's system of 58 community and technical colleges, Wayne Community College was established as Goldsboro Industrial Education Center on June 15, 1957. The original on-campus building was completed in November 1960, and until fall 1962 all courses were taught in the evening, and all students were part time. In the 1962-63 school year, the first full-time courses were offered leading to diplomas in automotive mechanics, electronics, drafting, and practical nursing. During the 1962-63 school year, Goldsboro I.E.C. had 47 students enrolled with eight faculty members; 1963 through 1965 three extension units of Goldsboro I.E.C. were established in Morehead City, Kenansville, and Clinton; later to become Carteret, James Sprunt, and Sampson community colleges. In January 1964, Goldsboro I.E.C. became Wayne Technical Institute. By fall 1966, the enrollment had increased to approximately 550 curriculum students and more than 1,500 extension students. During the late sixties, several additional classroom buildings were added to the campus. In November 1967, a community vote approved the necessary financial support, and Wayne Technical Institute became Wayne Community College. By the fall of 1968, the enrollment had risen to nearly 700 curriculum students. The student population's rapid growth overwhelmed the facilities. In January 1974, the Board of Trustees commissioned a master plan for campus relocation to Wayne Memorial Drive. The first building on the new campus, constructed in 1978, housed auto-diesel technology, welding, watchmaking, drafting and electronics programs. A local bond referendum in 1986 provided $9.9 million in construction funds, which were matched by state funds during the years to follow. By the fall of 1992, five buildings were completed. A 1993 statewide bond referendum provided the $6.3 million necessary to add two more buildings on campus and an aviation building at the local airport. All were in use by the winter of 1996. Enrollment and program offerings continued to grow, and so has the campus. In the fall of 2000, voters overwhelmingly approved a statewide Higher Education Bond that provided Wayne Community College nearly $13 million for construction, renovation and repair. Three buildings were built and several functional areas were reconfigured and renovated, with the last of the new facilities opening in spring 2007. Through the decades, Wayne Community College has established a reputation for quality in certificate, diploma, and associate degree programs which prepare students for promising careers. The college also takes pride in its associate degree in arts and associate degree in science college transfer programs and its graduates who have a high success rate at four-year institutions. Use of technology in the classroom, modern computer labs, and options for Saturday, evening, and distance learning courses have made instruction at Wayne Community College more effective and convenient for students. As the instruction options have increased, so has Wayne Community College's enrollment, which now stands at more than 15,000 curriculum and non-credit students. Wayne Community College will strive to maintain its long-standing reputation for quality training and education of our community's citizens.Wayne Community College was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1970, and was reaffirmed in 1974, 1986, 1995, and 2006.

The City of Goldsboro, the county seat, is the center of population, serving a major economic function as the trade and service center for Wayne County. The population of Goldsboro and Wayne County is more than 123,000.Wayne County, formed in 1770, was named for the great Continental Army General, Anthony Wayne. Almost a century later, in 1865, the last battle of the War Between the States was fought at Bentonville, 18 miles west of Goldsboro. Since the mid-1960s, industrial growth led Wayne County to a more balanced industrial-agricultural economy. Agriculture continues to be the major source of income for Wayne County residents. Tobacco is the principal cash crop followed by corn, cotton, grains, and soybeans. Livestock and poultry are major sources of income for Wayne County farmers. Numerous manufacturing companies are located throughout the area. Manufacturing is diversified in Wayne County, including furniture and cabinets, metal fabricating, electrical components, transformers, replacement automotive parts, aviation-related cargo systems, mass transit power systems, packaging, and food stuffs such as tortillas, bread, pickles, and pork products. Five local newspapers, four radio stations, and a modern 316-bed hospital serve Wayne County. There are close to 170 churches which represent various religious faiths. Varied recreational facilities include swimming pools, parks, public and private golf courses, a Family \"Y\" and a state park. The county is home to several historic sites, museums, and arts and cultural organizations. Numerous festivals provide year-round activities and entertainment. Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, one of the most important and modern bases in the United States, is located at Goldsboro. It is the home of the Air Combat Command's 4th Fighter Wing, the 916th Air Refueling Wing, an Air Force Reserve Command Unit, and several other squadrons and detachments.

Wayne Business and Industry Center2012 Performance Measures Results In 1993, the State Board of Community Colleges began monitoring performance data on specific measures to ensure public accountability for programs and services. In 1998, the General Assembly directed the State Board to review past performance measures and define standards to ensure programs and services offered by community colleges in North Carolina were of sufficient quality. The State Board of Community Colleges and the General Assembly approved twelve performance measures for accountability in 1999. Later in 2007, the General Assembly approved the reduction of performance measures to eight. Each performance measure begins with a description/definition, the standard that must be achieved, and the College's performance for that measure. Additional information on the eight performance measures can be found in the Wayne Community College Office of Planning and Research. 1. Progress of Basic Skills Students. Measure not included this year, as authorized by Section 8.6 of S.L. 2012-142. 2. Passing Rates on Licensure and Certification Examinations. This measure reports the percentage of first-time test-takers from Wayne Community College passing an examination required for North Carolina licensure or certification prior to practicing the profession. There are two standards that must be met for this measure. The aggregate institutional passing rate of 80 percent and the minimum accepted performance on any single reported examination of 70 percent. Wayne Community College's performance was 77 percent. 3. Performance of College Transfer Students. The purpose of this measure is to compare the performance of students transferring to a university with an associate degree or 24 articulated college credit hours, the percentage who have a grade point average (GPA) equal or greater than 2.00 after two semesters at the university. Lists of students enrolled in 2009-2010 receiving an associate degree during that academic year and those who had accumulated at least 24 articulated college transfer credit hours data were sent to UNCGA. These lists were matched against fall 2010 and spring 2011 UNC system student records to determine transfer enrollment at a North Carolina public university and first year academic performance. Two reports for each college were accessed from this site for this measure: First-Year UNC Academic Performance of 2009-10 Community College Associate Degree Recipients and First Year UNC Academic Performance of 2009-10 Community College Students with at Least 24 Semester Hours of Community College Coursework. Data from D.4. Percent of Students with End-of-Year GPA=>2.00 in these reports were combined to determine the overall percentage of transfers with a GPA equal or greater than 2.00 after two semesters at the university. Community colleges are allowed to supplement this data with acquired performance data from private and outofstate institutions that is consistent with the methodology employed by the UNCGA in calculating the data for transfer to public universities. The standards that must be met for this measure is 83 percent of students transferring to a university with an associate degree or 24 articulated college transfer credit hours will have a grade point average (GPA) equal to or greater than 2.0 after two semesters at the university. The exceptional institutional performance standard is 88 percent meet or exceed the aggregate performance of native UNC sophomores and juniors. Wayne Community College students' performance on the first standard was 88 percent and 88 percent on the8 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE exceptional standard. Combining the two, the aggregate was 88 percent. 4. Satisfaction of Program Completers and Non Completers. This measure reports the proportion of graduates and early leavers who indicate that the quality of the college programs and services met or exceeded their expectations. The standard is that 90 percent of the combined respondents will report being satisfied with the quality of Wayne Community College's programs and services. Ninety-nine percent of the combined respondents reported being satisfied with the quality of the College's programs and services. 5. Passing Rates of Students in Developmental Courses. The definition of this measure is the percent of students who complete developmental English, mathematics and reading courses with a grade of \"C\" or better. The standard is that 75 percent of students who complete a developmental course will have a grade of \"C\" or better for that course. Eighty-six percent of Wayne Community College students taking a developmental course completed the course with a grade of \"C\" or better. 6. Curriculum Student Retention, and Graduation and Transfer. This measure reports the percentage of fall credentialseeking students who have graduated or are still enrolled at the same college, a university, or another community college one year later. The performance standard for this measure is 65 percent of the fall credential-seeking students will graduate, remain enrolled at the same college, or transfer to a university or another community college one year later. Sixty-seven percent of Wayne Community College students either graduated, remained enrolled, or transferred to a university or another community college in 2011. 7.

Success Rate of Developmental Students in Subsequent College-Level Courses. The purpose of this measure is to provide evidence that developmental courses equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary for success in their college studies, to pass curriculum courses. The standard is 80 percent of students who completed a developmental course in 2009-2010 and completed subsequent college level course in 2010-2011 will have a passing grade for the college level course.

The Fall and Spring Semesters are each sixteen weeks in length, and the Summer Term is approximately 10 weeks in length. Classes normally WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 17 meet hourly for fifty minutes with a ten-minute break between classes. The number of times that a class meets each week is determined by the number of semester hours credit and the lab or clinic hours required by a course. Semester hours credit is awarded as follows: one semester credit hour for each hour per week of class lecture, one semester credit hour for each two or three hours per week of laboratory work, one semester credit hour for each three hours of clinical per week, and one semester credit hour for each ten hours of work experience. Registration All students are required to register at the beginning of each semester of attendance. No credit can be granted for courses in which the student is not properly registered. Students attending class for which they are not officially registered will receive neither grade nor semester hour credit for the course. Classes missed due to late registration will be counted as absences. Registration instructions are published prior to each registration period. Change of Schedule The last day that courses may be added each semester is stated on the College calendar. Any student wishing to drop a course must complete the drop procedure on or before the 51st day of the semester or the 29th day for the Summer Term. For eight week courses, refer to the appropriate semester Registration Information or contact the Office of Admissions and Records. If additional tuition and fees are owed, all schedule changes must be officially processed the Business Office. Student Course Load The normal student course load is 15-17 semester hours. A student must register for 12 semester hours Fall and Spring Semester, and 9 semester hours Summer Term to be considered a full-time student. The maximum course load is 20 semester hours. The permission of the Advisor must be obtained in those cases where more than 20 semester hours are scheduled, unless specified by the curriculum. It is strongly recommended that full-time students who have part- time employment not work more than 10-15 hours per week. Students who are working more than 20 hours per week should consider attending the College on a part-time basis. Classification A student is classified as a freshman from initial enrollment until 32 semester hours credit has been earned. Students who have earned 32 semester hours or more are classified as sophomores. Student Attendance Policy Wayne Community College expects students to gain skills, competencies and an awareness of a workplace ethic which emphasizes responsibility and commitment. The College believes that when students attend class regularly they are demonstrating responsibility and commitment to their education. Students must attend 80 percent of the total class hours to receive a passing grade. Students must attend the class during the first ten percent (10 percent) of the class to be considered enrolled in the class. Pre-curriculum students must attend 90 percent of the total class hours and must attend during the first 10 percent of the class. Instructors will not excuse absences under this policy. Absences due to late registration are counted as regular absences. If a student is in excellent academic standing, instructors may adjust the attendance procedures. Instructors expect students to make up missed work, but students cannot make up absences. If a student drops, withdraws, or stops attending a class, he or she will receive a grade of \"OW\", \"W\",\"WP\", or \"WF\". Programs in Allied Health, Aviation, BLET, Cosmetology, High School, and courses leading to credentials have stricter attendance procedures than that stated here. Each department has the right to set a reasonable policy regarding tardiness to class with the approval of the Vice President for Academic and Student Services. Students may completely withdraw from the college at any time prior to exams and all grades will become \"OW\"'s. Students withdrawing from the college should contact the Office of Admissions and Records for the appropriate forms and procedure for official withdrawal. Excused Absence Procedure Wayne Community College students are allowed two (2) excused class days per academic year, including religious observances required by the faith of the student. For the purposes of this procedure, an academic year begins on the first day of fall term classes and ends on the last day of spring term classes each year. Student shall be given the opportunity to make up any tests or other work missed due to an excused absence. 1. Students requesting absence from class must complete a Request for Excused Absence Form. 2. Have it signed by the Instructor(s). 3. Submit it to the Admissions and Records Office for approval within the first seven school days of the term. Failure to submit the completed form by the deadline will result in the request being denied. The Admissions and Records Office will provide the student with a copy of the approved/denied form. Students should keep the copy for their records. Closure of the College Due to Adverse Weather and Other Conditions When inclement weather threatens, the President of the College or her designee will make any necessary decisions to cancel classes, delay classes, or totally close the College and all its operations. The decision will be announced on campus e-mail/communication systems, area radio and television stations, and the college website. Every attempt will be made to have the announcement published by 6:00 a.m. on the day of the closing or delay. If the College is already operating when inclement weather forces such a decision, college-wide e-mail and text message via Cruiser Alert will be used, as well as other campus communications and public media, to announce the decision. Decisions regarding closings and delays will be made on a day- to-day basis, taking into consideration local conditions, as well as weather forecasts. Often, decisions about evening classes are made independently. In those cases, every attempt is made to announce decisions by 3:30 p.m. If the main campus is closed, all campus activities are canceled and off-campus sites are closed with the possible exception of SJAFB and WCC Child Care Center. Status for SJAFB classes will be determined in conjunction with the Base Education Office. If classes are delayed, the announcement will state the time the College will open. In times of inclement weather, radio and television stations will normally only make announcements about delays or cancellations. Therefore, the absence of an announcement means that the College is operating on an normal schedule. Course content missed due to the College Closing will be made up through outside assignments or rescheduled classes and will be communicated to students electronically or when classes resume. 18 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE Make-up assignments must be equivalent to the material that would have been covered during the missed class(es) and must be approved by the appropriate instructional supervisor. For classes where contact hours are critical (such as BLET, nursing clinical, etc.), make-up classes will be scheduled at the convenience of the students and instructor. Class make-up plans must be documented on the Inclement Weather Make-up Plan Form and attached to the final class roster, which is retained in the departmental offices. Grading System and Grade Point Average The 4.00 grade point system is used to calculate student grade point average. The letter grades used are as follows: A - Outstanding-4 grade points per semester hour. AH - Outstanding-4 grade points per semester hour. (Honors) B - Above average-3 grade points per semester hour. BH - Above average-3 grade points per semester hour. (Honors) C - Average-2 grade points per semester hour. D - Poor-1 grade point per semester hour. F - Failing-no grade points earned. * I - Incomplete-no grade or grade points because of incomplete work. An \"I\" will be removed from the transcript when departmental requirements as listed within the contract are completed. Any grade of \"I\" will be changed to \"F\" if not removed by the maximum time limit of two semesters. * P - Passing. * AU - Audit-no grade or grade points. * X - Credit by examination * OW - Denotes official withdrawal from the course during the school term. \"OW\" indicates that the student will receive no grade and no credit for the course. The student must officially withdraw from a course to receive an \"OW\". R - Reenroll * W - Denotes withdrawal from the course during the school term. \"W\" indicates that the student will receive no grade and no credit for the course. * WP - Withdrawal passing - Withdrawal (passing) the end of the drop period (effective Fall Semester 2010) - no grade or grade points. * WF - Withdrawal failing - withdrawal (failing) after the end of the drop period. (effective Fall Semester 2010) Prior to Fall Semester 2010 - unofficial withdrawal after the end of the drop period - no grade or grade points. WF is calculated in GPA as an F. * NA - Never attended - no grade or grade points * ND - Academic Forgiveness for D * NF - Academic Forgiveness for F * NG - No grade * NWF- Academic Forgiveness for WF. * Not included in computing grade point average. The grade point average is calculated by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of semester hours attempted, including both courses passed and failed. Effective Fall Semester 2002, when a course is taken more than once, only the highest grade will be included in calculating the GPA. Prior to Fall Semester 2002, all grades were included in calculating the GPA. All courses attempted will be shown on the official transcript. A \"C\" average in the major is required for graduation. A \"C\" average on the 4.0 grade point system is a 2.0 grade point average.Grade Reports Final semester grades are posted on WebAdvisor as soon as they are processed at the end of each semester. Grade Appeal Process A student has the right to appeal a course grade when he/she believes that his/her performance in a course has been incorrectly evaluated by the instructor. Any such appeal should be initiated no later than two business weeks following the completion of the course. The first level of appeal, in all cases, should be to the instructor involved. Only if the issue cannot be resolved between the instructor and student should further appeals be made. In that case, a student should make his/her appeal in writing to the appropriate Department Chair and should clearly set forth the basis for the student's belief that the evaluation is incorrect. The Department Chair will work with the instructor and, where appropriate, with the Division Chair to review the student's appeal. The Department Chair, with the Division Chair's input, will make a response to the student within one business week of the date of appeal. If the student is not satisfied with the Department and Division Chairs' decision, the student has the right to appeal that decision in writing for review by the Vice President for Academic and Student Services. The Vice President may communicate with the student, instructor, Department Chair and appropriate Division Chair, in order to understand the basis for appeal. If deemed necessary, the Vice President may appoint a peer review committee of curriculum faculty to act in an advisory capacity. At the completion of this review and within one business week of the student's appeal (to the Vice President), the Vice President for Academic and Student Services will make a decision and convey that decision to the student, instructor, Department Chair, and Division Chair involved. The decision of the Vice President for Academic and Student Services is final. Academic Progress Students are expected to show successful academic progress by maintaining a GPA of 2.0 while enrolled at Wayne Community College. The college will identify students that fall below the minimum 2.0 GPA to provide them additional guidance as needed to achieve that success. Students that do not meet this standard will be required to adhere to the following guidelines until the minimum GPA of 2.0 is obtained. Academic Early Alert - When student performance is deemed unsatisfactory by the instructor prior to midterm (by the fourth week), that instructor will issue an early alert. The intent of the early alert is to notify students of poor academic performance and to jointly develop a plan of action for improvement. Early alert decisions may be made based on attendance, class work, homework, test grades, etc. Academic Warning - Any student receiving a GPA below 2.0 at the end of a semester will receive notification of an academic warning. The student will be required to meet with his/her advisor before he/she can register for classes and should discuss their academic needs. When the GPA does improve, the student will be placed back in good standing. Academic Progress for Financial Aid Purposes - For students receiving financial aid, academic records are reviewed at the end of each semester. A student is expected to maintain the required cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 in order to receive and/or maintain eligibility for financial aid. A student must pass a minimum of 67 percent of all credit hours attempted at the end of each semester WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 19 and may not exceed the 150 percent maximum time frame required to complete the eligible degree, diploma or certificate program. Effective July 1, 2011, all students receiving financial assistance are granted a one semester or term warning period in order to make and/or maintain satisfactory progress. During the warning period, the student may continue to receive financial aid based on eligibility. If, at the end of the warning period, the student re-establishes satisfactory progress for financial aid purposes, then the warning status is lifted and the student is making satisfactory progress. A student who fails to meet satisfactory requirements following the one warning semester may be ineligible for financial aid at WCC. A student whose financial aid has been suspended may attend the following semester(s) or terms without the benefit of financial aid in order to make up the grade point average (GPA) and/or hours deficiencies. Appeal for Financial Aid Purposes - A student who has become ineligible for financial aid has the right to appeal. The appeal must be submitted in writing along with supporting documentation to the Financial Aid Office Appeal Committee. An appeal may be considered based on circumstances involving but not limited to an extended illness or hospitalization of the student, an accident that incapacitates the student for an extended period of time or death or extended illness of an immediate family member resulting in significant responsibilities for the student. Submission of an appeal does not guarantee approval. A student whose appeal is approved may continue to receive financial aid for the term. The student is notified that he/she is being placed on probation for the term. At the end of the term in which the student is on probation, he/she is expected to be making satisfactory academic progress or be successfully following an academic plan designed to make sure the student will be able to meet satisfactory standards by a specific point in time. If the student is not making satisfactory progress at the end of the probationary term, all federal and state financial aid (grants, scholarships, loans, and work-study) will be terminated. The student may continue to attend the College without the benefit of federal or state financial aid. Grade Forgiveness Policy Students may submit a written request to the Vice President for Academic and Student Services to have grades earned at Wayne Community College, which are at least five years old, forgiven. Under this procedure, the student may request that previous grades of \"D\", \"WF\", or \"F\" not be used in calculating the grade point average. A record of all past work will remain in the student's permanent file; however, the course grades that are forgiven will be prefixed with an \"N\", and the grade and credit hours will not be calculated in the student's grade point average. To be eligible for grade forgiveness, students must be currently enrolled and have completed a minimum of 12 semester hours of required courses in the chosen program of study within the past year, while maintaining an overall grade-point average of 2.0 or above, with no grade lower than a \"C\". The written request must include the following information: 1. The course grades for which forgiven is being requested 2. The reason(s) the request is being made 3. Name, address, and student identification number of the person making the request 4. Copy of the current student transcript If the request for grade forgiveness is approved by the Vice President, a new transcript will be mailed to the student by the Director of Admissions and Records. If the student transfers to another institution, the grade forgiveness will be voided, and his/her transcript will list all records of courses, including those that were excluded by grade forgiveness. Recipients of federal financial aid or veteran's benefits are not eligible for this forgiveness policy under federal guidelines and regulations. The student should contact the Financial Aid Office or the Office of Veterans Affairs for information. Credit by Examination Credit by examination may be allowed for a given course if a regularly enrolled student can demonstrate the required level of proficiency (\"C\" or better) as a result of independent study and experience. This credit will be based on a departmental examination under the direction of the department chair in which the course is offered. Credit hours will count toward graduation; they will not be computed in grade point average as grades and grade points will not be recorded. Application for credit by examination must be processed in the Office of Admissions and Records. A fee of $71.50 per semester hour for in-state students and $263.50 per semester hour for out-of-state students must be paid except in case of full-time students taking 16 or more hours for whom there would be no additional charge. Exams may be scheduled at the discretion of the Department Chair involved. Credit by exam excludes a student from Academic honors such as the President's List or Dean's List. Change of Program Students wishing to change their program of study should contact Counseling Services. To change programs, students must be currently enrolled (excluding summer), and students can make only one change per semester. The program change will become effective the next semester the student is enrolled. Auditing Policy Classes may be audited with permission of the instructor if space is available. Priority will be given to regular credit students. Participation in class discussions and examinations is at the option of the instructor. Attendance is required as if the course is taken for credit. No credit by examination can be allowed for courses that have been audited. A grade of \"AU\" will be recorded with no hours credit or grade points. A fee of $71.50 per semester hour for in-state students and $263.50 per semester hour for out-of-state students must be paid except in case of full-time students taking 16 or more hours who may audit with no additional charge. Graduation Requirements The following requirements apply to all programs; however, some departments may have additional requirements. 1. All required and elective courses must be completed as prescribed in the catalog of record of the candidate for graduation. 2. A major 2.0 grade point average must be maintained. 3. Minimum reading requirements must be completed for each program. A minimum of DRE 097 is required for certificate and diploma programs. DRE 098 is required for a few certificate and diploma programs and for all degree programs.20 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE Depending on the student's program, this requirement must be met either by satisfactory placement scores or by completing DRE 097 or DRE 098. In instances where students receive transfer credit for ENG 111, its equivalent, or a course that has DRE 098 as a prerequisite, the reading requirement will be satisfied. 4. All financial obligations to the College must be cleared. 5. A minimum of 25 percent of semester hours in residence with a minimum of nine semester hours in the major area is required for graduation. Upon recommendation of appropriate faculty and the division chair, the Vice President for Academic and Student Services may waive the requirement of a minimum of nine semester hours in the major area. 6. Application for graduation must be received by the posted deadline. NOTE: The application cannot be processed during registration periods.

This prerequisite may be a class that is required before registering for the next level, or it may refer to placement test scores that are required before registering. Students must comply with catalog requirements. Courses may not be taken until all prerequisites have been met. There are occasions in which exceptions to this regulation may be deemed desirable and necessary. The appropriate Department/Division Chair of the division in which the course is offered must approve such exceptions in writing. Exceptions to the course prerequisite are the following: Developmental prerequisites may be fulfilled by an appropriate placement test score or appropriate high school GPA; Visiting students who have written documentation from their college/university to enroll in a specified course that has a prerequisite; Students with an associate or higher level degree who enroll in beginning college level courses (e.g. ENG 111; PSY 150); Students who have life experiences that are deemed equivalent to or supersede the prerequisite; a reserved review of course level outcomes would occur and be maintained in the student's records; Students who successfully complete a course that has a prerequisite would not have to take the prerequisite (example, a student who completed PSY 150 with the local prerequisite of RED 090/DRE 098 would not have to take RED 090/DRE 098). Credit by exam may be used to meet prerequisite requirements. Co-requisites Co-requisite courses are courses that must be taken at the same time. An example of co-requisite includes lecture and lab courses such as BIO 140 Environmental Biology and BIO 140A Environmental Biology Lab. All lecture and lab courses must be taken together during the same term. Transcripts Request and Fees An official transcript of work at Wayne Community College will be sent to the appropriate institution upon written request by the student. Wayne Community College requires a written request 24 hours prior to release of a transcript. Transcripts will be prepared at a cost of $2 per copy (No checks accepted). No transcript will be released until the student's account is cleared with the Business Office. Cooperative Education Program Cooperative Education (Co-Op) is an educational plan that integrates classroom learning with supervised work experience in an employment situation directly related to the education program of a student. Co-Op enhances the educational process by bringing the worlds of theory and application together. Students learn the important link between academic learning and what is expected in the workplace. Depending on the curriculum program, Co-Op students work from one to three semesters in a part or full time job. This can either be a paid or a volunteer position with employers approved by the Co-Op Instructor Coordinator. Academic credit is given for the learning gained during the Co-Op 22 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE work experience. Work experience involves the development of job skills directly related to the educational program of the student. Eligibility Students must meet certain criteria before the College may award credit for a Co-Op work experience. Students who are enrolled in approved Co-Op programs of study and who have completed a minimum of nine semester hours credit (9SHC), which must come from the core curriculum, are eligible to Co-Op if they meet the following conditions: 1. Academic standing of 2.000+ GPA 2. Approval from Co-Op office 3. Approval of Co-Op Instructor Coordinator Certain curriculum programs may specify additional conditions. Application and Registration Procedures Interested students should see their advisor to register for Co-Op. The student must attend a the mandatory Co-op orientation at the beginning of each semester. Co-Op workbooks will be distributed, an explanation of how to complete the workbook will be given, and an overview of Co-Op regulations and criteria will be outlined during orientation. Open enrollment for Co-Op allows students to enter Co-Op after the initial 10 percent period of the semester, allowing flexibility in the program. Students need to register for open enrollment in the Co-Op office. Academic Credit Credit hours for Cooperative Education are determined by the total number of hours a student works during the semester. The breakdown of credit hours to hours worked on the Co-op job is as follows: 1 Semester Credit Hour = 160 Hours Worked 2 Semester Credit Hours = 320 Hours Worked Programs of Study with Co-Op The following programs of study have either mandatory or elective Co-op: Accounting Agribusiness Technology Applied Animal Science Technology Automotive Systems Technology (GM-ASEP) Automotive Systems Technology (ATEP) Business Administration Collision Repair and Refinishing Computer Information Technology Computer-Integrated Machining Health Business Information Healthcare Management Technology Human Services Technology Medical Office Networking Technology Office Administration School Age Education Simulation and Game Development Sustainable Agriculture Turfgrass Management TechnologyCooperative Programs/Career and College Promise (Dual Enrollment) Career and College Promise provides seamless dual enrollment educational opportunities for eligible North Carolina high school students in order to accelerate completion of college certificates, diplomas, and associate degrees that lead to college transfer or provide entry-level job skills. Dual enrollment is designed for high school juniors and seniors who attend public, private or non-public schools in Wayne County area; and who are at least 16 years of age. Eligible students may select the College Transfer Pathway or the Career Technical Education Pathway. Students who are enrolled in the Early College High School or School of Engineering have different eligibility requirements.

Students should always check with the Admissions Office of the receiving institution.) Six (6) semester hours of natural sciences. Six (6) semester hours of social and behavioral sciences. Six (6) semester hours of the same foreign language. (For students who graduate from high school in 2003-2004 and beyond) The North Carolina Comprehensive Articulation Agreement The North Carolina Comprehensive Articulation Agreement (CAA) is a statewide agreement governing the transfer of credits between North Carolina Community Colleges and North Carolina Public Universities and has as its objective, the smooth transfer of students. The CAA includes two degrees at the community college level: the Associate in Arts and the Associate in Science. Both degrees consist of a general education core and electives. The general education transfer core reflects the distribution of discipline areas commonly included in institution-wide, lower division, general education requirements for the baccalaureate degree. The general education core includes study in the following areas: English composition, humanities/fine arts, social/behavioral sciences, and natural sciences/mathematics. Community colleges and universities have identified community college courses appropriate to a general education transfer core. These courses are listed in this section of the catalog. Transfer Assured Admissions Policy (TAAP) The CAA addresses the admission of community college graduates to UNC institutions and the transfer of credits between institutions within the North Carolina Community College System and institutions within The University of North Carolina. The CAA assures admission to one of the 16 UNC institutions with the following stipulations: Admission is not assured to a specific campus or specific program or major. Students must have graduated from a North Carolina community college with an Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degree. Students must meet all requirements of the CAA. Students must have an overall GPA of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale, as calculated by the college from which they graduated, and a grade of \"C\" or better in all CAA courses. Students must be academically eligible for re-admission to the last institution attended. Students must meet judicial requirements of the institution to which they apply. Students must meet all application requirements at the receiving institution including the submission of all required documentation by stated deadlines. The major components of the CAA are described below: The CAA enables North Carolina Community College graduates of two-year Associate in Arts(AA) and Associate in Science(AS) degree programs who are admitted to constituent institutions of the University of North Carolina to transfer with junior status. Universities cannot place requirements on students transferring under the CAA that are not required of their native students. Transfer students will be considered to have satisfied the UNC Minimum Course Requirements (MCR) in effect at the time of their graduation from high school if they have: 1. received the Associate in Arts, the Associate in Science, the associate in fine arts, the baccalaureate or any higher degree, or 2. completed the 44-hour general education core, or 3. completed at least six (6) semester hours in degree-credit in each of the following subjects: English, mathematics, the natural sciences, and social/behavioral sciences, and (for students who graduate from high school in 2003-2004 and beyond) a second language. Community college students who have completed the general education core will be considered to have fulfilled the institution-wide, lower-division general education requirements of the receiving institution. Community college graduates of these programs who have earned 64 semester hours in approved transfer courses with a grade of \"C\" or better and an overall GPA of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale will receive at least 64 semester hours of academic credit upon admission to a university. Requirements for admission to some major programs may require additional pre-specialty courses beyond the pre-major taken at the community college. Students entering such programs may need more than two academic years of course work to complete the baccalaureate degree, depending on requirements of the program. All courses approved for transfer in the CAA are designated as fulfilling general education, pre-major or elective requirements. While general education and pre-major courses may also be used as electives, elective courses may not be used to fulfill general education requirements. CAA courses taken beyond the 64'shc of credit in which the student received less than a \"C\" will not negate the provisions of the CAA. Community college students who have not completed the general education core will have their transcripts evaluated on a course-by-course basis by the receiving institution; and the students will come under the basic studies requirements of the receiving institution. Associate In Arts Program (A10100) The Associate in Arts Degree is designed for students desiring to pursue a four-year degree in one of the liberal arts disciplines or training at a professional school that requires a strong liberal arts background.

Communicable Disease Policy for Students Wayne Community College is committed to assuring that all necessary training and precautions are taken with regard to communicable diseases. The Biohazard Exposure Control Plan and the Pandemic Preparedness Plan of Wayne Community College reflect our efforts to ensure the good health and safety of all employees and students. The College adopts this communicable disease policy for students in an effort to control communicable diseases and the threat of pandemics on campus based upon established rules and regulations of the N.C. Division of Health Services. Employees and employees of contractors or contracted services infected with a communicable disease have the responsibility of reporting this fact to the Director of Human Resources. Students infected with a communicable disease have the responsibility of reporting this fact to the Associate Vice President of Academic and Student Services or the Vice President of Continuing Education, as appropriate. Communicable Disease shall include, but is not limited to: Chickenpox, Infectious Mononucleosis, Conjunctivitis, Hepatitis A, B & D, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Aids-related complex (ARC), positive HIV antibody status, Influenza, Measles, Meningitis, Tuberculosis, Whooping Cough, and sexually transmitted diseases.(N.C.G.S. 130A) Persons who are infected with a communicable disease are expected to seek expert medical advice and are encouraged to advise local health authorities. Local health authorities should offer counseling to these persons about measures that can be taken to prevent the spread of infection and to protect their own health. Persons who know, or have a reasonable basis for believing, that they are infected with a communicable disease have an ethical and legal obligation to behave in accordance with such knowledge to protect themselves and others. Medical information relating to the communicable disease of a student or employee will be disclosed to responsible college officials only on a strictly limited need-to-know basis. No person, group, agency, insurer, employer, or institution should be provided any medical information without the prior specific written consent of a student unless required by state and/or federal law. Furthermore, all medical information relating to the communicable diseases of students and employees will be kept confidential, according to state and federal law, including the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act. If a student reports a communicable disease condition, the student may be excluded from the institution until an appropriate evaluation of the student's medical condition can be made. The evaluation may be made by a physician or a health department official and testing may be required if appropriate. Students in any Allied Health program may have additional requirements, as specified in each program's student handbook; therefore, these students should report all suspected communicable diseases. The final determination of student's ability to remain in school will be made by the Vice President or Associate Vice President based upon professional medical evaluation results and recommendations. If a student is found to have a communicable disease, then the attendance of the student on campus or at any College activity will be prohibited until a satisfactory letter or certificate is obtained from one or more licensed physicians or public health officials stating that the student is not a health risk to employees and other students at the College. The College's Biohazard Control Plan defines guidelines that will be followed in the event of an accidental exposure to bodily fluids or biohazards. Any such exposure should be reported immediately to the responsible faculty or staff person associated with the WCC activity involving such exposure and to the Student Activities Coordinator and an incident report must be completed. Counseling Services Counselors are available to assist students with academic and personal concerns and to facilitate educational planning, career planning, and future planning.

PREAMBLE Academic institutions exist for the transmission of knowledge, the pursuit of truth, the development of students, and the well-being of society. Free inquiry and free expression are indispensable to the attainment of these goals. As members of this academic community, students are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for truth. Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic conditions in the classroom, on the campus, and in the community. Students should exercise their freedom with responsibility. As members of the academic community, students are subject to the obligations that accrue to them by virtue of this membership. As members of the larger community of which the college is a part, students are entitled to all rights and protection accorded them by the laws of that community. By the same token, students are also subject to all laws, the enforcement of which is the responsibility of duly constituted authorities. When students violate laws, they may incur penalties prescribed by legal authorities. In such instances, college discipline will be initiated only when the presence of the student on campus will disrupt the educational process of the college. However, when a student's violation of the law also adversely affects the college's pursuit of its recognized educational objectives, the college may enforce its own regulations. When students violate college regulations, they are subject to disciplinary action by the college whether or not their conduct violates the law. If a student's behavior simultaneously violates both college regulations and the law, the college may take disciplinary action independent of that taken by legal authorities. II. STUDENT RIGHTS A. All rights and privileges guaranteed to every citizen by the Constitution of the United States and by the state of North Carolina shall not be denied any student. B. Students are free to pursue their educational goals. Appropriate opportunities for learning in the classroom and on the campus shall be provided for by the college. Student performance will be evaluated solely on an academic basis, not on opinions or conduct in matters unrelated to academic standards. C. Students have the right to freedom of expression, inquiry, and assembly without restraint or censorship subject to reasonable and non-discriminatory rules and regulations regarding time, place, and manner. D. Students have the right to inquire and to propose improvements in policies, regulations and procedures affecting the welfare of students through established student government procedures, campus committees, and college offices. E. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 provides safeguards regarding the confidentiality of and access to student records, and this Act will be adhered to by the college. Students and former students have the right to review their official records and to request a hearing if they challenge the contents of these records.

Purpose - The purpose of the Student grievance Procedure is to assure students that their grievances will be considered fairly, rapidly, and in a non-threatening atmosphere. Students have the right to grieve when they have reason to believe that a condition, situation, or action affecting them is unjust, inequitable, and/or a hindrance to effective performance. A grievable action is an action that is in violation of written campus policies or procedures or constitutes arbitrary, capricious, or unequal application of written campus policies or procedures. This would include alleged discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, handicap or other conditions, preferences or behaviors (excluding sexual harassment complaints, which, due to its sensitive nature, would first be directed to the grievance officer appointed by the President, and only if not resolved by meeting with the grievance officer would then follow the remainder of the grievance procedure). This would also include academic matters (excluding individual grades except where the above conditions apply). B. Procedures - These procedures are not intended to initiate disciplinary action against a member of the faculty, staff or administration, or to alter college policy. 1. First Step - The student must go to the instructor or staff member where the alleged problem originated. An attempt will be made to resolve the matter equitably and informally at this level. The conference must take place within five business days of the incident which generated the complaint. 2. Second Step - If the grievance is not resolved at the informal conference, the student must talk with the faculty/ staff member's immediate supervisor (e.g. department chair) who will attempt to resolve the issue. This discussion must take place within five business days of completion of step one. 3. Third Step - If the grievance is not resolved within the department, the student may file a written grievance. The student would obtain the grievance form from the Director of Counseling Services who will explain the grievance process to the student. The completed grievance form must be returned to the Director within five business days of completion of step two. The Director will then refer the grievance to the appropriate administrator (e.g. division chair) involved. The administrator shall respond in writing to the student within ten business days of receipt of the grievance form. 158 WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 4. Fourth Step - If the written statement of the administrator does not satisfy the grievant, the student may request to appear before the Student Grievance Committee. The student must submit a written request to the Director of Counseling Services and be received within three business days of receipt of the administrator's statement. The request shall include a copy of the original grievance form, a copy of the administrator's written response, and the reason why the administrator's response is unsatisfactory. The Director shall immediately notify the President who shall insure that the Committee is organized in a manner consistent with Section C of this procedure (The Student Grievance Committee). The Director will send copies of the appeal to the members of the Committee, the employee, and the employee's supervisor. The employee against whom the grievance was filed shall be given an opportunity to respond in writing to the chairperson of the committee. The Student Grievance Committee shall meet between five and fifteen business days of receipt of the request (excluding school breaks). A postponement may be granted by the Chairperson upon written request of either party, if the reason stated justifies such action.

Fifth Step - The Committee's decision may be appealed by either party involved to the President of the College within three business days of receipt of the Committee's decision. Failure of the student to accept receipt of the letter within six business days of letter postmark ends the appeal procedure and the student forfeits his/her right to further appeal. If the written appeal is not received by the President within the time frame the appeal process ends and they forfeit their right to further appeal. The President shall review the Committee's findings, conduct whatever additional inquiries deemed necessary, and will render a decision within ten business days of receipt of the appeal. 6. Sixth Step - The President's decision may be appealed by either party involved to the Board of Trustees within three business days of receipt of the President's decision. Failure of the student to accept receipt of the letter within six business days of letter postmark ends the appeal procedure and the student forfeits his/her right to further appeal If the written appeal is not received by the Board of Trustees within the time frame the appeal process ends and they forfeit their right to further appeal. The Board of Trustees or a committee for the Board shall review any information to date, conduct whatever additional inquiries deemed necessary, and render a decision within twenty business days of receipt of the appeal. The decision of the Board will be final. C. The Student Grievance Committee - The Disciplinary Review Committee may serve as the Student Grievance Committee or, at the direction of the President, a new Committee may be formed for each grievance. Committee makeup and method of appointment will be the same as for the Disciplinary Review Committee. D. Right of Parties Involved in a Grievance - When a grievance committee meeting is scheduled, the parties involved are entitled to: 1. A written notice of the complaint. 2.

E. Prohibitions - Neither the student, nor his/her representatives (counsel, family, friends, etc.), shall contact a Student Grievance Committee member, the College witnesses, the President, members of the Board of Trustees, or other community constituents prior to the student grievance proceedings. Such contact constitutes a breach in the grievance process and may adversely affect the meeting. GRADE APPEAL PROCESS Purpose The purpose of this section is to describe the process by which a student may appeal the final grade given by an instructor for completion of a curriculum course. A student who wishes to appeal a grade given for assignments, rather than for the completion of a course, should see the appropriate instructor and/or department chair. Procedure A student has the right to appeal a course grade when he/she believes that his/her performance in a course has been incorrectly evaluated by the instructor. Any such appeal must be initiated no later than two business weeks following the completion of the course. The first level of appeal, in all cases, should be to the instructor involved. Only if the issue cannot be resolved between the instructor and student should further appeals be made. In that case, a student should make his/her appeal, in writing, to the appropriate department chair and should clearly set forth the basis for the student's belief that the evaluation is incorrect. The department chair will work with the instructor and, where appropriate, with the division chair, to review the student's appeal. The department chair, with the division chair's input, will make a response to the student within one business week of the date of appeal. If the student is not satisfied with the department and division chairs' decisions, the student has the right to appeal that decision, in writing, to the Vice President of Academic and Student Services. The Vice President of Academic and Student Services may communicate with the instructor, department chair, and appropriate division chair in WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 159 order to fully understand the basis for appeal. The Vice President of Academic and Student Services may appoint a peer review committee of curriculum faculty to act in an advisory capacity. At the completion of this review and within one business week of the student's appeal, the Vice President of Academic and Student Services will make a decision and convey that decision to the student, the instructor, department chair and division chairs involved. The decision of the Vice President of Academic and Student Services is final.

Discovery of a Fire Immediately give the alarm by shouting \"Fire! Fire! Fire!\" and proceed to pull the nearest fire alarm. Notify the switchboard operator by dialing ext. 0 or the Office of Public Safety and Security by dialing ext. 7050 from any WCC phone. When the building fire alarm sounds, walk quickly to the nearest exit and alert others to do the same. Once outside, report to the designated evacuation meeting area for the building you are evacuating. Severe Weather / Shelter-in-Place During severe weather or other emergencies requiring shelter-in- place or moving to indoor shelter, the campus public address system will be used to notify you of the emergency and give directions. Please follow all directions given as quickly and quietly as possible. Review the red cards available in most rooms for guidance prior to an actual emergency. Campus \"LOCK DOWN\" If ever a dangerous situation develops that poses a serious threat to the college and jeopardizes the safety of students or employees, the President or his/her designee will initiate a campus \"Lock Down.\" \"Lock Down\" will be announced either by college personnel in a building or over the public address system and will remain in effect until terminated by law enforcement. Follow these simple guidelines: Get to the nearest room, as quickly and quietly as possible. If outside and you cannot safely get inside a building, find the closest hiding place and stay there until an all-clear is issued. Close, lock and barricade doors. Turn off all lights and electrical devices (radios, computers, monitors, projectors, etc.). Close all blinds, drapes and shades. Silence all cell phones. Do not use cell phones except to communicate with law enforcement. Stay out of sight and find cover behind concrete walls, desks, cabinets, etc. Once on lockdown, do not evacuate for a fire alarm unless you see fire or smoke or can verify that there is indeed a fire. It may be a ploy to get you in the open. Follow all orders from law enforcement and stay calm. Upon seeing intruders or victims, call 9-1-1 and report as much information as possible without attracting attention.

WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DRUG AND ALCOHOL PREVENTION PROGRAM The abuse and use of drugs and alcohol are subjects of immediate concerns in our society. These problems are extremely complex and ones for which there are no easy solutions. The college strives to encourage prevention of drug and alcohol abuse to the extent possible. The college's prevention program includes an educational program aimed at preventing drug abuse and illegal drug use, therapeutic support through short-term clinical counseling and appropriate referrals, and deterrence through an active public safety and security department which works closely with local law enforcement. From a safety perspective, the users of drugs or alcohol may impair the well-being of all employees, students, and the public at large; drug and alcohol use may also result in damage to college property. Therefore, in compliance with the Federal Drug-Free Workplace and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1988 (Public Law 101-690), it is the policy of this college that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance or alcohol, is prohibited while in the workplace, on college premises, or as part of any college-sponsored activities. Any employee or student violating this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination or expulsion and referral for prosecution. The specifics of this policy are as follows: 1. Wayne Community College does not differentiate between unlawful users, pushers, or sellers of drugs or alcohol. Any employee or student who possesses, uses, sells, gives, or in any way transfers a controlled substance or alcoholic beverage to another person, or manufactures a controlled substance while in the work place, on college premises, or as part of any college sponsored activity, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination or expulsion and referral for prosecution. 2. The term \"controlled substance\" means any drug listed in 21 CFR Part 1308 and other federal regulations, as well as those listed in Article V, Chapter 90 of North Carolina General Statutes. Generally, these are drugs which have a high potential for abuse. Such drugs include, but are not limited to, Heroin, Marijuana, Cocaine, PCP, and Crack.\" They also include \"legal drugs\" which are not prescribed by a licensed physician. The term alcoholic beverage includes beer, wine, whiskey and any other beverage listed in Chapter 18B of the General Statutes of North Carolina. 3. If any employee or student is convicted of violating any criminal drug or alcoholic beverage control statute while in the workplace, on college premises, or as part of any college-sponsored activity, he or she will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination or expulsion. Alternatively, the college may require the employee or student to successfully finish a drug abuse program sponsored by an approved private or governmental institution as a precondition for continued employment or enrollment at the college. 4. Each member or student is required to inform the college in writing, within five (5) days after he or she is convicted for violation of any federal, state, or local criminal drug or alcoholic beverage control statute where such violation occurred while in the work place, on college premises, or as part of any college-sponsored activity. A conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo contendere) or the imposition of a sentence by a judge or jury in any federal or state court. 5. Convictions of employees working under federal grants, for violating drug laws in the workplace, on college premises, or as part of any college sponsored activity, shall be reported to the appropriate federal agency. The Office of Human Resources must notify the U. S. Government agency, with which the grant was made, within ten (10) days after receiving notice from the employee or otherwise receives actual notice of a violation of a criminal drug statue occurring in the workplace. The college shall take appropriate disciplinary action with 30 calendar days from receipt of notice. As a condition of further employment on any federal government grant, the law requires all employees to abide by this policy. 6. A description of applicable state sanctions and the health risks associated with the use of both illicit drugs and alcohol is in the previous part of this section.WAYNE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 165 DRUGS AND THEIR RISKS TYPES OF DRUGS: Schedule and opium extracts and narcotics.
