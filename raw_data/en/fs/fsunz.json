WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF HOW TO FIND YOUR INNER GODDESSMAMA MIA! PREGNANCY AND PARENTINGBEATING THE BLUES/CRThese words, from the loudmouthed matriarch of TV\u00d5spremier dysfunctional sitcom family, struck a chord withme when I first read them years ago and were a refrain in my mind during the production of this special women\u00d5sissue of The Positive Side . \u00d2Taking power\u00d3 is easier said than done, as we all know. How to do this when the odds arestacked against you\u00c9as a woman, person living withHIV/AIDS, drug user, single mother, gay man or lesbian?One of the oldest slogans of AIDS activism is \u00d2knowledge =power.\u00d3 That conviction is the driving force of the work wedo here at CATIE: disseminating cutting-edge treatmentinformation so people with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) have theknowledge they need to make informed decisions abouttheir health care and quality of life. Along with thatknowledge often comes a sense of empowerment.

Gananouque, Ontario You don\u00d5t have to do this alone. Having a strong supportnetwork helps you to live with the virus and break down the isolation. Women tend to feel isolated for many reasons.Women also have to look after everybody else. A lot of womendon\u00d5t have the resources that men do. With so many burdensand obligations, it\u00d5s harder for us to ask for help. Support is very important for me and over the years I\u00d5vedeveloped a strong support network. I have to express my highregard for the gay community, as they had to fight the hardest,and this is where 90% of my support comes from. Every time Ifind out that someone is newly diagnosed, I get themconnected. It\u00d5s vital to know that you don\u00d5t have to do it alone;there is support out there. There is somebody out there whoknows what you\u00d5re talking about. -Knowledge comes in many shapes and sizes. There\u00d5s treatment knowledge \u00d1knowing the facts and keeping up to date on the latest research. And thenthere\u00d5s the deeper knowledge about living with HIV \u00d1 the emotional, sharing,communal and inspirational stuff that lets you know you\u00d5re not alone as youface the challenges of life with HIV. This double issue is jam-packed withboth kinds of knowledge \u00d1 all the info a woman needs to reach herpotential in the health and happiness department \u00d1 to help make it theuseful reference guide we wanted to create for women, with women. HIV infection rates are on the rise in women. Before1995, women represented 8% of new HIV infections inCanada. In 2001, the number rose to 25%. Globally, 50% of adult PHAs are now women. AIDS dispropor-tionately affects women and girls who are vulnerableand who shoulder the burden of caring for others. Theexecutive director of the United Nations DevelopmentFund for Women (UNIFEM), Noeleen Heyzer, recentlysaid: \u00d2We must do all we can to loosen and removethe grip of this terrible disease. I believe that one ofthe most powerful HIV vaccines available today iswomen\u00d5s empowerment\u00c9 Women\u00d5s empowerment is thekey to reversing see fromreading this Positive Side , it doesn\u00d5t take the head of UNIFEM to know this. Gracing the cover are women who live with HIV/AIDS and those who workwith HIV+ women (including Shamim ShambeMiradam, a CATIE staff memberwho\u00d5s been working with HIV+ women for the past decade). I want to thankthem all for taking time out from their busy lives to make this Positive Side so vivacious. Their stories, experiences and feelings \u00d1 and those of manymore HIV+ women (most of whom live too far to have made it to the photoshoot) \u00d1 infuse this issue. We posed the following question to each womanwe interviewed: \u00d2What subject is nearest and dearest to your heart as awoman living with HIV?\u00d3Their responses are a revelation. Revel in them! They are sure to inspire.Share the magazine with your HIV+ sisters\u00c9and brothers (there\u00d5s stuff foryou too!). Take it to your doctor, nurse or other health care provider,because they learn from you as well. Read it on the bus and let peopleglance over your shoulder and learn a thing or two about the fabulous, gutsywomen who live with HIV. ROAR. Jocelyn Paul, 49 Diagnosed with full-blown AIDS: 2000 (with 3 CD4 undetectable. Volunteer at AIDS NewBrunswick and Healing Our Nation. St. Mary\u00d5s First Nation, New Brunswick Itry to learn a lot about HIV andbring it back to my community. I recently spoke to some Aboriginalhigh school students about HIV. Ourcommunity is not in the woodssomewhere, it\u00d5s right in the middleof the city, so youth can get a holdof drugs and alcohol quite easily.They should know that HIV canhappen to anyone. I never thought itwould happen to me and I\u00d5m havinga really hard time with it now. Family and community support is very important. I get a lot ofsupport from my kids, grandchildren and community. I\u00d5m openabout my status and haven\u00d5t faced any problems in mycommunity yet, even though I know there are a lot of problemsout there. If my community hadn\u00d5t accepted me, I\u00d5d be dead bynow. But they care; they ask me about the medications andwhether they\u00d5re working for me. Community acceptance makessuch a big difference. When I was diagnosed, I couldn\u00d5t talk to anyone else, I hadnobody to call. I could feel my spirit dying. Then I went on awomen\u00d5s retreat, where I met other HIV+ women. I got a lot ofsupport from other PHAs. They became my family. Now everybodyknows I have HIV. I\u00d5ve even asked AIDS New Brunswick to keepmy name and number open to anyone who\u00d5d like to talk aboutHIV. I\u00d5d like to reach the women who have HIV and no one to talk to, who want to learn more. It\u00d5s true, there are a lot of differences between Aboriginal PHAs and other PHAs, but we all have one disease. - Taking Care Taking Care 1 103 58 292 4Breathe.

When I found out I had HIV , I thought my sex life was over. I'd never kiss again, let alone have sex. There wouldbe no dating, no relationships, no children. I'd die alonein the hospital, untouchable, unlovable. Actually, my issues around my sexuality began long before I was diagnosed with HIV . At the age of 14, I was sexually wounded. This affected me in so many ways, especially when it came to trustingpeople. However, I believe that the most damage I sufferedstemmed from my family and the media. Like mostwomen, I grew up in a world that advised me that mylooks and body were my most important assets. Unfortunately, I didn't get off to a good start. I was a chubby little tyke who no one cooed over. Usually theresponse to stumbling across me was: \"Will she lose allthat hair?\" I never felt especially cute, and growing upwith a mother who was obsessed with looks didn't help.I remember at age 6 asking my mother, \"Am I pretty?\"Her delayed reply was, \"Not really, but at least you won'thave to watch your looks fade.\" As a teenager, my self-esteem was below sea level. Y earning for love and affection, I went on a journey,searching for approval, which took me to places I don'trecommend \u2014 the world of drugs, anorexia andeventually prostitution. I saved and polished every hurtthat curled out of the mouths of such wise sages as someJohn who told me, as I straddled him, that I was quiteattractive in the dark. I had a little affirmation that I saidto myself in those days: \"Y ou're 25 years old, you're a pieceof shit and you deserve to die.\"It was a man with a few kind words and information about 12 steps who steered me in another direction.When I got sober, I embarked on a spiritual journey,went to therapy, found a higher power and started tochange my life. My self-respect sprouted when I returnedto school to get a health degree. I supported myself as an aerobics instructor and fitness trainer, which fit inperfectly with my ever-present eating disorder. In my last year of college, that all changed. I'd met the man I thought was The One \u2014 and he felt the same way about me! I had finally reached a point inmy life when I didn't feel I had to sleep with someonejust because they smiled at me, so we'd been making outa lot but we hadn't had sex yet. He suggested we gettested for HIV . Without thinking about how that couldpotentially completely change my life, I walked into thehealth department and had my blood drawn. Two weeks later, I was told I had HIV . My boyfriend followed me as I ran from the office. He tried to comfortme, but as we got off the train and went our separateways, I knew the relationship was over. I headed straightto the diner. I walked through the door, sat down in abooth and ordered French toast, syrup and butter. It wasso good I ordered another. HIV...who cares?! For the next year I explored the mirror image of starving/bingeing. I ate everything, as much as I wanted.Sometimes I stuffed myself until I was ill, and other timesI gleefully ordered a burger, fries and chocolate shake andHOW HIV IMPROVED MY SEX LIFE AND GAVE ME GODDESS STATUSS P R I NG 2 0 0 37felt satisfied .Up until that point ,I'd spent my whole life moni toring what went in my mouth .I'd starved,vomited and compuls ively exercised to maintain a certain weight. Some people are afraid ofspiders or the dark;I was afraid ofHellman n's. But,suddenl y,with HIV,all bets were offand I could have anything I wanted.I was going to die soon ,so what did it matter? Besides ,food is a perfect anesthetic and I wasn't feeling a thing \u2014 including all the initial terrors about being HIV+ .Not feeling desirable? A glazed donut or six can fix that.Waking up in the middle ofthe night afraid I'm going to die alone? Don't worry,have som e buttered noodles. I didn't even realize I was putting on the pounds at rapid speed.Needless to say,my aerobics classes thinn ed out as I got thicker,and eventua lly I could care less if you had six-pack abs or the perfect butt because all I wan ted to do was hibe rnate.I moved back to the small town where I was born and that's where I discovered I was a sex goddess . In those days,I didn't look too closely in the mirror.I wore a new size,called One Size,and favoured flowing, floral prints.One day a friend came by to show me some photos she'd taken at a party.I pointed to a rather large woman with a double chin and asked who she was.My friend said,\"That's you!\"That's when I realized how big I had gotten.I'd gained about 80 pounds and had been doing a good job ofignoring it,but now there was nowhere to hide .I thou ght,I'll go on a diet,but did I want my last meal on earth to be a Slimfast shake? No! Instead I started the Goddess Flesh Club.The only requirement was to celebrate cellulite.I could n't get anyone to join,so I set out solo to love my fleshy self. My first step in loving myselfwas to love others .I needed to change my perception ofwhat was beautiful ,so I designated all women in the universe as goddesses and went on a sightseeing adventure.No matter what shape, age,size,race or style,I could find something spectacula r about any woman I encountered.As my perception of others shifted,it slowly started to shift for myself,though admit tedly this was a lot harder. I'd been picking myselfapart for so long that the litany offlaws I possessed seemed endless ,so I had to move slowly. One thing I did was ask myselfa simple question: What did you do to be so awful?I had no valid answer to that question. I rummaged through all the hurts I'd collected in my lifetime \u2014 from the playground taunts ofSweaty Betty and Wilma the Whale to the hurtful brother who told me I was a fat,ugly pig throughout my entire adoles cence.I needed new input . I gave myselfone hour each day when I didn't criticize myself.Ifmy inner loudspea ker calle d me a fat,ugly pig,I gently told myselfthat's not true.Hours led to a day and days led to a lifetime ,which brings me to today,when it's become rare for me to call myselfanything but lovely.But I am gettin g ahead ofmyself. I had to accept my fat but I wasn't ready to look at it.So I'd light candles ,play music and touch the parts of myselfI abho rred \u2014 my thighs,lower belly,ass. I'd talk to my body and tell it how soft it felt, and eventually I was able to face the mirror and remember to admi re,not analy ze.It also helped to turn off the TV and stay away from those horrid women's magazines that proclaim all my imperfections every month .The funny thing was,when I began to feel better about my body I didn't need to stuffmy face anymore.I just ate when I was hungry,and some weight came off, but that wasn't the point.When I finally came to from my food-indu ced oblivion,I had to start dealing with having HIV... which included dealing with my sexuali ty. When you reach a certain weight in this cultu re,you disappea r.My weight gain was a way to pad myselffrom sexual attention .I used to think it was safer to be fat than to meet some nice guy and eventually have to tell him I have HIV and watch as he goes through the gamut of disbelief ,disgust and eventfully the need to depa rt.Som e guys have stayed;granted,they would n't be men I'd choose to be with ifI was HIV negat ive,but,feeling like damaged goods ,I thou ght it was all I dese rved. When looking in the mirro r, admire don't ana lyze! Start a love affair with yourselfthat includes gifts, kindness, encou ragement... and a vibrator. Find a part of your body that you love. (For me, it was my hands and my feet.) Focus on that body part until your admiration spreads to the parts you loathe. Write a letter to whate ver part of your body (hump, belly, legs) is upsetting you. Have that part of your body write a letter back. Treat yourself like your best friend. Your best friend would never commen t on the size of your stomach. Encou rage other people's goddesses to come out. Shift your perception and find some thing beautiful in each person you encounte r. Be kind and gentle in uncovering your beaut y.

Some essential oils should not beused if you are pregnant, have high blood pressure or suffer from epilepsy,so be sure to consult with an aromatherapist. Provided by Hazra, certified aromatherapistBrigitte Charbonneau, House. Ottawa, Ontario The meds and my HIV status affect my sex drive. Sex drive? What does that look like? What does it feel like? I had to resort to testosterone shots once a month. This month I had my fourth shot,and my sex drive is slowly coming back. Iknow it\u00d5ll never be what it was before I wasdiagnosed, but if I didn\u00d5t take the shot, mypartner would have to wait for sometimeseven three months. We\u00d5ve been together sixyears and I\u00d5ve never heard a complaintfrom him. Intercourse isn\u00d5t one of thethings I\u00d5m into, because I\u00d5m terrified, evenif my partner wears a condom. But we dohave it sometimes. I try to protect him fromgetting infected. I wouldn\u00d5t let anyone getinfected like I was. I live with HIV and Iknow what it\u00d5s like. So we improvise a lot.We\u00d5re into sex toys, movies, the Internet. I call this a healthy sexual relationship. I don\u00d5t know what I\u00d5d do if my partner and I split up. I feel totally blessed. He\u00d5s the first man who\u00d5s accepted me for who I am. Healso loves my grandchildren as his own. When we met, I didn\u00d5t tellhim about my status for the first six months. When I finally did, theonly thing he asked me was: \u00d2Do I have to worry about anything?\u00d3 I said \u00d2never,\u00d3 and it was never brought up again. This relationship is a safe haven for me. My second husband infected me with HIV. I lived away from home for a long time, but I kept going back to him because I thought he was the only man I could have sex with. I went back not because of love or respect,but because of sex. Now I know the world can be filled with love and respect. - THE POSITIVE SIDE8Photos (this page): Jake PetersLaurette Levy, 46 Diagnosed with 1985); CD4 count: 600; Viral load: undetectable. Writer. Volunteer at Voices of Positive Women.Toronto, Ontario When I was diagnosed, I\u00d5d been living with my partner and his son for three years. We were planning to buy a house and the future looked rosy. Six months after my big news and his seronegative status,my partner left after having broken up with me via telephone. Verycourageous indeed! After that, I stayed alone for two years. Then I meta wonderful man who, when I finally told him about my status, took mein his arms saying, \u00d2It\u00d5s OK, I love you anyhow.\u00d3 A few years later wewere happily married\u00c9or so I thought. Although we were very aware of the risks and always practiced safe sex, my husband gotmore and more afraid of being infected. So Ibecame less and less proactive sexually andwe ended up sleeping in separate rooms. Forthe first time, I started to feel ashamed ofhaving HIV \u00d1 me, who has always defendedthe rights of HIV+ women! That wasunbearable. The failure of our marriagewasn\u00d5t totally linked to HIV, but it had a lotto do with it. HIV has changed my relationship with my body. At first, I didn\u00d5t see my body differentlybecause I was healthy. There was no visiblesign of the disease. But when I started to get sick and take drugs, my body changed. It\u00d5s difficult to deal with,especially for a woman, because the image of the female body is sostrong in our society; you have to be thin, young and beautiful. Whenyou hit your 40s, your body changes, and mine changed in a strangeway. My arms and legs got skinnier and my breasts got bigger. In my mind, I\u00d5m still desirable. It\u00d5s always pleasant to feel that a man is looking at you. But my body isn\u00d5t desirable anymore because it\u00d5sbecome a danger. In the last few years, I\u00d5ve avoided meeting partnersbecause I don\u00d5t want to explain my situation. I\u00d5m still very afraid ofbeing rejected, so I protect myself by not meeting anyone. There are a lot more HIV+ people out in the gay community than in the heterosexual community. Gay people know what HIV is. They havesex. It\u00d5s quite different for a woman. Many HIV+ women don\u00d5t evenhave sex with their partner. True, there are other things, liketenderness and massage, but it wasn\u00d5t the case for me. The HIV+women I know who do have sex lives are younger. So, with me, theremay also be an age problem. Personally, I\u00d5ve given up on sex. I find that HIV negative heterosexual men are not willing to have a relationship. I hope it\u00d5s not the same forevery woman. When your partner is HIV negative, it\u00d5s important todiscuss the issue. You can have a different sex life that\u00d5s more gearedtoward tenderness and massages, touching the other person\u00d5s body.You have to keep an open mind, be willing to explore new things, notalways penetration or things you used to do when you weren\u00d5t HIV+. Don\u00d5t be afraid to talk about it. Don\u00d5t be ashamed to be HIV+. Don\u00d5t feel plague-stricken and don\u00d5t let anyone make you feel this way. Wecan\u00d5t let that happen because it\u00d5s extremely unfair and painful. Wecannot accept that. - S P R I NG 2 0 0 39With the celebration ofmy juicy,ripe curves came a confiden myselfregardless ofmy diagnosis .After my goddess transfo rmation ,I felt I could disclose and hold my head up.I learned to feel people out first befo re breaking the news .For instan ce,when a guy asked what I do,I'd say I work with HIV+ women .Ifhe seemed OK with that,I'd take it a step further and talk about a friend who's posit ive.Ifhe reacted negat ively at all I would n't give up,but I'd give myselfsome warning that this might be a little difficult and perhaps hurtful,and I'd evaluate whether I wanted to go further.(Should I get to know him a little,educate him befo re I discl ose or just walk away because he's not worth it?)

I've had long-term relationshi ps and one-night stand s with HIV negat ive men .And I always disclosed no matter what because I just can't relax and have a good time unless I'm up-f ront about my diagnosis .I tell men that they're safer with me because they know for sure and won't put themse lves at risk.Just explaining \"safe\"can be erotic;it goes beyond a condom .In some way,I look at the AIDS epidemic as a sexual revolution because now,in order to be safe,we have to talk about sex and get specific . And ifI'm going to all the trouble ofdisclosin g,taking off my clothes and bringing out the equipment (condoms , dildos ,vibrators,food items,outfits ,etc.),then I'm goin g to risk saying exactly what I want and how I want it. I'd been a receptacle my whole life,focusing on the pleasu re ofmy partners.But as an HIV-enhan ced sex goddess ,my sexual experience now begins with communication and leads into experimentation ,which turns out to be exciting for my partners as well as myself. This goes far beyond barrier sex (condoms,dental dam s and gloves);it delves into role-pl aying,fantasy and making sex an event,not just a roll around the bed that ends in orgasm (and usually not mine) . Sexual adventure can also be solo.I certainly didn't feel like I was settling when a few years ago I decided to forego relationships for a while and focus on moi.For my sexual pleasu know exactly what feels good for me,I can make it last as long as I want ,and I can do it with who ever I want because the biggest sex organ we have is our minds .

Snippets from her book, A Positive Life: Portraits of Women Living with HIV, can be glimpsed on her website, along with photos of her dog, Budd y, at www.riverhu ston.com.A couple ofyears ago,an amazing man came into my life. He didn't fit the profile ofwhat I thou ght my mate would be,but he's an incredible partner.I never had to formall y disclose to him because in my small town I'm the local loudmouthed activist.In our serodiscordant relationshi p, HIV is rarely an issue (his refusal to be intimida ted by HIV between the sheets is one ofthe reasons I've become so attached to him) .We have other concerns \u2014 he's 14 years younger than me and sometimes I have to really work on my body image again because he looks like he walked out ofa Calvin Klein ad.But I'm his goddess and he reminds me at every turn.It's been a blessing I never thou ght possible . In all my past relationships ,even when I'd stopped settlin g, I always felt a nagging dissatisfaction that they were not The One.That doubt has now melted away like buttah on a griddle . Our lovemaking has range d from amazing to stalled in its tracks ;sometimes it's erotic and sometimes it's more loving and comforting.There are times when I don't feel like having sex.Maybe it's because I'm having side effect s from treatments or an infection or I just don't have the ener gy or desire,but I've learned in this relationship that we have to be honest ,open and willing.I also need to recognize the reaso n behind my sex drive or lack of.Sex isn't everything,but it is impo rtant.Besides being fun, pleasu rable and even spiritual ,it's a way to stay connected. So,after we spent six months renovating our house and stopped having sex out ofsheer exhaustion ,we needed to talk about making time and finding ways to stay sexually connec ted.There have been times we've played out a fantasy that he's still into and I've become bored with,so I've had to find ways to introduce things into fantasy that excite me again.When I'm having an ugly attack ,which usua lly indica tes to me that I'm having some othe r insecu rity,I can talk to him about it and he can talk me down.I don't have to ask,\"Honey,am I disgusting? \"Instead I ask him to tell me what he likes about my body,and for him the list is endless...so endless that he recently got down on his knees and asked me to be his blushing bride! I know I've found someone extraordinary.But I also know ifI hadn't found him,I'd already foun d myself...someone equally as magnificent.And after 12 years ofhealin g,I always know the right things to do and say to remember that I am a goddess. RIVER'S TOP 5 GODDESSE S My grandmo ther May Madonna Rita Mae Brown Lucille Clifton (the greatest poet who ever walked the planet) Eleanor Roosevelt THE POSITIVE SIDEPhoto of Janet: Michelle Valberg Igot HIV in 1982 when I had a blood transfusion, but I wasn\u00d5t diagnosed until 1993. I didn\u00d5t cry when I found out. I went outside, got into my car, lit a cigarette, got a pop somewhere and got lost for a while. When I got home, I told my husband and said he\u00d5dhave to wear condoms from now on. He refused and turned on me. I left him after mydiagnosis because he was an alcoholic and you can only take so much. When I told him I had HIV, he got worse. So I left. When I was diagnosed, my parents and five siblings turnedtheir cheeks the other way. I needed their help badly. I wasliving on $450 a month. I didn\u00d5t care if I lived ordied\u00c9until Jack, my spouse, came along. If it hadn\u00d5t beenfor him, I\u00d5d be six feet under. I feel hurt by my familybecause they avoid me. My brother Michael is the only oneI see; he comes to play bingo with me. My mother told me, \u00d2Don\u00d5t go around telling people.\u00d3 But Idon\u00d5t want to keep it a secret. I\u00d5ve got nothing to hide orbe ashamed about. People have put me down: \u00d2SallyRichard, she\u00d5s a whore.\u00d3 I\u00d5ve had someone throw a hot cupof tea at me. I\u00d5ve been barred from a couple of bingos. When I go to bingo, my mind is clear. I listen to the numberscalled out and I concentrate on that. A couple months in a row, I won $500! I\u00d5m not tightfisted. I\u00d5ve got a heart. But in some ways, I\u00d5ve got a heart ofstone because people have hurt me. I\u00d5ve been broken-hearted too many times, so I\u00d5ve becometough. I\u00d5ve been hurt from a child up. You can only take so much in your life. It\u00d5s important tostay away from people who upset you because it can lower your T-cell count.I\u00d5ve never come across a woman in my category who got HIV from tainted blood. I wish Icould sit down and talk with someone like me about how she feels, what she\u00d5s gonethrough and how long it took for her to accept it. What troubles did she go through? Did she have family to help her? At times, I wonder about all this. - Janet Conners, 47 Diagnosed with HIV: 1989; CD4 load: undetectable. Wannabe AIDS activist.Hatchet Lake, Nova Scotia From the moment we\u00d5re diagnosed, we begin a struggle to remain a wholewoman. First and foremost,what we tend to become is awalking, talking virus. Youbecome defined by your virus:You\u00d5re an HIV+ woman. You\u00d5renot young, old, a mother, awoman of colour, aschoolteacher\u00c9I don\u00d5t thinkthat happens with men. Still to a large degree, there\u00d5sa pretty dehumanizing elementwithin the medical community. In some of my earlier experiences, somehow there wasthe assumption that I have the virus and therefore I\u00d5m notsexual anymore, I don\u00d5t really have the right to be sexualanymore. And, if I\u00d5m going to be, the onus for preventionof pregnancy and infection falls on me.I cannot tell you how many times people (both within andoutside of the AIDS community) said to me after myhusband died: \u00d2Surely you can find a nice straight HIV+guy out there.\u00d3 As if the only person I could ever dateagain has to be HIV+. To me, that puts us into some kindof second-class place. So, it\u00d5s not bad enough how dirty orinfected you feel once you\u00d5re diagnosed, but now you\u00d5resecond class and you can only date an HIV+ man. I thinkit also speaks volumes about the perception of HIV+ men.My husband, Randy, has been dead for nine years andI\u00d5ve been with my partner for three years. For six years Ididn\u00d5t date. I completely withdrew. I was in mourning forRandy, and because his experience showed me what Icould expect, I was also mourning the loss of my ownfuture. I threw myself into work. And I surrounded myselfwithin the gay community. It was kind of like being at asmorgasbord with your mouth wired shut, surrounded bybeautiful, intelligent, attractive, interesting men that Icould never have.My partner Terry and I met at a single\u00d5s dance for\u00d2older\u00d3 people. It had nothing to do with HIV. My bestfriend convinced me to go to these dances. It was myfirst big leap back into the straight social world. I methim at the third dance I went to. His response when wetalked about my HIV status was: \u00d2Well, quite frankly, Iprobably feel safer with you than I would with any otherwoman. Firstly, you know you have HIV, and secondly, youprobably know more about HIV prevention than any otherwoman in this province.\u00d3This past December, Terry gathered our combined familyand literally got down on bent knee and proposed to me. There are so many people working against us continuingto be a complete or total woman, and it\u00d5s a battle, butwe can do it. - SPRING 2003 11HA VE YOU EVER USED ACUPUNCTURE TO LESSEN YOUR PAIN OR FATIGUE? Taken echinacea, zinc and marshmallow root for a sore throat? Practiced guidedimagery or breath work to help you settle to sleep atnight? If so, you're not alone! Nearly half of all Canadians are taking a more individualized approach to their health care these days\u2014 choosing to combine safe therapies, products andpractices from across health belief systems in a way thatworks for them. Most often, it's people living withchronic illness who seek complementary ways to managetheir symptoms and improve their quality of life. Thoseliving with HIV/AIDS are perhaps the strongestadvocates for this type of health care, as many who werediagnosed before Western pharmaceutical treatment wasavailable relied on things like nutrition therapy, mind-body awareness and traditional medicines to keep themwell. And women more often than men are drawntoward this holistic way of understanding and managingtheir often-complex health concerns. I often wonder about the relationship between women and integrative health care. Has it evolved as a result ofwomen's historic \"health-tending\" role in our familiesand communities, and the natural opportunity forexploration that this role provides? Does it have anythingto do with the verbal sharing of health stories,experiences and outcomes that women are so comfortablewith? Does it sadly reflect firsthand knowledge of therelationship between emotional dis-ease and the onset ofchronic illness in women? Is it supported by a genderpreference for \"process\" over \"solution\"? If so, how doesthis translate into health-seeking behavior and choices? The Tzu Chi Institute in Vancouver, British Columbia, has a vested interest in answering some of these questions.As Canada's leading advocate for integrative health care,the nonprofit institute is committed to expanding thepossibilities for wellness and quality of life in our society.Our work is carried out through clinical research and information/education initiatives and partnerships. Womencomprise 70 %of our clients, the majority of them reporting three or more health concerns \u2014 most related directly to achronic illness. We are deeply interested in the reasonspeople are attracted to integrative health care. A main focusof our research is to explore the decision-making processpeople engage in around \"integration,\" their eventualchoices and, of course, the related health outcomes. Evaluating the effectiveness of an integrative approach is a critical next step for organizations like ours. Funders ofhealth care, such as the provincial ministries of health,want to know if there is a cost-benefit to the health caresystem when people engage in integrative health practices.Do they have fewer emergency room visits? Do they usefewer pharmaceuticals to manage symptoms? Do they visittheir family doctors as often? How much are they spendingoutside of the publicly funded system? For this type of research to be sound, integrative health care must be defined clearly enough to measure results withina consistent framework. While there's no widely accepteddefinition in this emerging field, there is growing agreementamong patients, health care providers and researchers that itembraces many of the following principles: yIt\u00d5s based on an equal partnership between patient and practitioner and honours the patient as the expert of his or her own health. yIt involves care and treatment of the whole person \u00d1 mind, body, spirit. yIt enhances a person\u00d5s to people.\u00d3 yIt values quality of life and wellness outcomes as highly as it does a cure. yIt acknowledges synergy as a healing principle: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.TO MAKE WHOLE OR COMPLETE BY ADDING OR BRINGING TOGETHER PARTS. TO UNIFY.Robyn, 33 Diagnosed with HIV: eat well . I\u00d5d like to eat better, but unfortunately the cost of \u00d2better\u00d3 is much more expensive. I try the best I can. I try to get things I can afford: a bit of lettuce, a tomato, broccoli. I takemultivitamins . That\u00d5s pretty much it. I get $187 every two weeks, and I have to feed myself and my two children, and buy clothes and whatnot! When worse comes to worse, there\u00d5s always a food bank. Youhave to do what it takes. Complementary therapy is expensive, and I need money for transportation. Anything of any cost that makes your life better is atough choice, as you have to sacrifice something. The AIDS committeehere has a PWA fund, and massage therapy was one of the things that used to be funded for people who needed it. Now they\u00d5ve cut it,together with some staff, and the funds are dropping every year. Lessand less services are available for people like me. - yIt employs an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to care and decision-making. yIt respects diversity. Over the past decade, the emergence of integrative health care has begun to push at the edges of ourpublicly funded health care system \u2014 nudging ittoward a more respectful, collaborative way of being.As witness to this evolution, I am humbled by thethought that this movement was initially driven by ahandful of courageous individuals determined to takean integrative approach to their own healing withoutthe benefit of scientific evidence or the increasedprofessional awareness that exists today. I have nodoubt that many of them have been women livingwith HIV/AIDS. - Barb Findlay is the executive director of the Tzu Chi Institute (www.tzu-chi.bc.ca). She is also a CATIE Board member.

Reiki practitioner. Student. York Region, Ontario After my diagnosis, I started seeing a naturopath , who works together with my doctor. I take homeopathic remedies , supplements and herbs. My naturopath designed a special program for me that includes vitamins C and B and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC).Depending on what\u00d5s going on in my body, I add other things. Forexample, I take folic acid because at some point I started havingabnormal cells in my cervix. Calcium and magnesium help me dealwith cramps. I also take evening primrose oil. Recently I added alpha-lipoic acid because, due to the medication, my triglyceride andcholesterol levels were going up. This supplement will bring themdown and help normalize my metabolism. Homeopathy takes into account not only the physical but also the spiritual and mental aspects of one\u00d5s well-being. When I started it,there were a lot of emotional issues coming up for me. I startedseeing a psychotherapist and working through those issues, such as the fears inside me that I was holding in. The more I did that, thebetter I felt. I started to forget that I was HIV+. I\u00d5m still in therapy. A few years ago I debated whether or not to start the meds, as my doctor thought it was a good idea. I had a good talk with mynaturopath, weighing the pros and cons, and decided to do so. Butmeds alone weren\u00d5t going to be enough for me; I also intended to goon with my supplements. When I started the meds, it seemed that thenutrients were replenishing my body and my immune system was getting stronger. My T cells have gone up from 300 to 1,100. Myhealth has improved tremendously. I\u00d5ve gradually learned the importance of listening to my body. I used to keep getting candidiasis, so I took all the sugar and yeast out ofmy diet. When I had a fungal infection, changing my diet helped it goaway in a few months. Now I sometimes just look at a certain foodand if my body screams, telling me not to have it, I listen. When I findthat my body is getting tired and says \u00d2I can\u00d5t take anymore,\u00d3 I rest,not necessarily sleep, but read a book or meditate . Even prayers help, and it doesn\u00d5t necessarily mean that one has to belong to acertain religion. - Penny Bradford, 50 Diagnosed with HIV: 1992; CD4 count: 390; Viral load: undetectable. Chair of the Victoria Persons With AIDS Society. Victoria, BC. I\u00d5d like to share some words of hope with other women. When I was diagnosed, at 40, I didn\u00d5t think I\u00d5d ever get to see any ofmy grandchildren. I thought I was quite along way from being a grandmother, andthis really made me sad. In 1996, though I was very reluctant to believe in them, I started on the new medications. Afterbeing on and off them for the past sixyears, I now feel very hopeful. I\u00d5mexpecting my second grandchild! It\u00d5s sucha joy in my life! so didn\u00d5t missit. Thanks to the meds and complementarytherapy, I feel much better than I used to. I\u00d5m very open-minded. I take vitamins and supplements . I do yoga. Through yoga I\u00d5m learning the art of being kind to myself and listening to my body. I have acupuncture and chiropractic treatments regularly and have just recently started Ayurvedic and homeopathy treatments as well. I\u00d5m trying to be more nutrition-minded. Regular walks are next on my agenda. I\u00d5ve been meaning for a long time to get into meditation ; one of these days I\u00d5ll make it. I\u00d5m trying to have quiet evenings at home, when I don\u00d5tturn anything on: no TV, music, nothing \u00d1 just silence. I believe in mind,body and spirit \u00d1 they all go together. I find prayers helpful. And I\u00d5m really learning a lot about my boundaries. Don\u00d5t give more than you\u00d5ve got. Knowwhere your line is. I\u00d5m getting to know where my line is more and moreeach day. I try to be whole and happy, try to strive toward balance in mylife: so much time for volunteering, so much time for myself and mygrandchildren. I haven\u00d5t achieved this balance yet \u00d1 and I don\u00d5t know if Iever will \u00d1 but it\u00d5s an ongoing process. - community-based organizations. Toronto, Ontario Ifound out I was HIV+ because I got very ill, first with shingles and a few months later, pneumonia. So it\u00d5s kind of amazing what good shape I\u00d5m in now. I attribute some of it to my constitution: I have good genes and comefrom a strong stock! But the other thing is that I\u00d5ve been careful about what Iconsume and I\u00d5ve been taking supplements for the past 14 years. So, the factthat my blood work is so good and my cholesterol and all my counts arenormal (my good cholesterol is high!) is also due to (besides the drugs), Ibelieve, dietand nutritional supplementation . I take a lot of \u00d1 vitamins , minerals , essential fatty acids . I generally try to eat more organic , whole foods and less refined foods. I don\u00d5t drink alcohol or smoke or do any other drug. Occasionally I go through periods when I get into chocolate (which Iconsider to be an essential food) and coffee. It\u00d5s very costly to take nutritional supplements all the time, but that\u00d5s always been a priority for me, so I\u00d5ve found ways around it. I worked at a supplementstore part-time, so I got a discount. I\u00d5m the founder of the Treatment Fund atVoices of Positive Women, which has been going on for about seven years (itwas started with a generous donation from comedian Sandra Shamas). We giveout either a good quality nutritional supplement package or we reimburseVoices members throughout Ontario for complementary therapies. I\u00d5m proud ofthis program; it would be good if more organizations would start similar ones.Recognition and support of complementary therapies as treatment for HIV islong overdue. - Minneh Kamau, load: undetectable. Volunteer at AIDS Vancouver Island and Victoria People with AIDSSociety. Public relations officer at the Cannabis Bias Club. Victoria, BC When I wake up in the morning I do a smudge \u00d1 a Native ritual that cleanses me and allows me to meditateabout my body and what it is feeling. Ilearned this from the First Nationspeople in Canada. All I know about it isthat it cleanses energy around theperson. You put some sage (not greensage) in a shell, and I have an eaglefeather that I use. I set the sage on fire;it bursts into flames and has this verysweet smell. I use the ash to cleansemy face and body. When I do this, Ialso say: \u00d2May my hands do good work,may my brain think good thoughts, maymy eyes see you, may my ears hear you,may my mouth speak the truth, may my heart be connected to you.Bless the womb, the fruit of life. May my feet walk the right path.\u00d3 Itcalms me down, it makes me understand that yesterday is gone and Ican start a new day. There is always a beginning and an end toeverything, and I never really thought about it before. Before my HIVand coming to Canada, I didn\u00d5t know this! This ritual helps me with my depression and to maintain a positive mood. - SPRING 2003 13Brigitte Charbonneau, 56 undetectable. Vice-chair of Bruce House. Ottawa, Ontario Lack of appetite is a side effect I get. I use potto help me with this. If I smoke before breakfast, I get the munchies, raid the fridge and eat anything I can find. But I don\u00d5t smoke it around my grandchildren, so it\u00d5sdifficult for me to eat when they\u00d5re around. My meals are half the size of thoseof my 8-year-old granddaughter. In the summer, I\u00d5m a vegetable and fruit freak, but I can\u00d5t eat it a lot of it now, it\u00d5s too rough for my stomach. I have to be very careful with what I eat now,especially if I\u00d5m going somewhere where there may be problems with abathroom, because it just happens. - Valerie Ashton, 54 Diagnosed with HIV: 1999; CD4 count: over 700; Viral load: below 30. Regina, Saskatchewan Iwas diagnosed with HIV after I went into the hospital with pneumonia. When I came home, I had this feeling as if I\u00d5d died and come back. I hadn\u00d5t gone to church in a long time; I stoppedafter I lost my son in a car accident in 1984. Thepain from my loss devoured me and I startedpartying to get rid of it. When I became HIV+ I wanted to get back into church. After I was diagnosed, I started seeing people in a different way. I have this yearning in my heartto help others. I want to reach out, to let peopleknow that I know what it\u00d5s like, I\u00d5ve been there. I find it hard to be my age and living with HIV. Ifnot for my faith, I don\u00d5t think I\u00d5d have the strength to be here today. I have nine grandchildren from my two daughters. The Lord has reallyblessed me! But I don\u00d5t have any friends who are HIV+ and I\u00d5d like tomeet more people living with the virus. I have so much to share withthem and so much kindness to offer. - Sheri Quinn, 36 Diagnosed with HIV and hepatitis C: 1993; CD4 count: 800; Viral load: 1,500. (Centre de Ressources etd\u00d5Interventions en Sant\u008e et Sexualit\u008e); English editor, de t\u0090te et de coeur (CRISS newsletter). Montreal (Quebec) Idon\u00d5t take medication because, after nine years, my immune system is still strong. I don\u00d5t know why the virus doesn\u00d5t seem to be progressing. I take vitamins every day to help keep my immune system balanced. I don\u00d5t know if this is why I\u00d5m still healthy or if it\u00d5sbecause of a certain gene I have or something. I take Moducare,plant sterols and sterolins which are known to help maintain CD4cells. I also take antioxidants in the form of whey protein and a multivitamin called Greens Plus. I prefer my supplements in powdered form because I feel that my body absorbs them better.(Plus, there\u00d5s no sales tax in Quebec on vitamins in powdered form.) Complementary therapy for me is not only vitamins and minerals. I believe in a holistic, healthy lifestyle, which one reaches throughmeditation, exercise, eating and sleeping properly, keeping stressdown, not doing drugs and not drinking too much. I have a drughistory, so staying off drugs is important for my health and sanity. Itry to make this integrated lifestyle the most important part of my life. To relieve my stress, I meditate , exercise and talk about what\u00d5s stressing me out. HIV and hepatitis C co-infection is an issue we don\u00d5t talk about enough. There\u00d5s a lack of information in this area. Hepatitis Ctreatment has very heavy side effects, is very toxic and doesn\u00d5t workfor everybody. People should be aware that there are natural alternatives to detox the liver and lower the enzymes. For example, antioxidants can be helpful. Before I try the treatment \u00d1 with itslevel of toxicity and terrible side effects \u00d1 I will try every single root,herb or plant I can find. -SPRING 2003 15THE POSITIVE SIDE14I DROVE TO WORK THIS MORNING THROUGH A POVERTY-STRICKEN NEIGHBOURHOOD with a highvolume of criminal activity, crack addiction, prostitution,fighting...the risk of HIV running rampant. For manyyears I participated in these activities in this veryneighbourhood. Back then, I'd pray for the sun to godown; all I could handle was darkness. But I'm no longerblocked from that light. T oday the sun was shining and Ihad a smile stretched from ear to ear. In fact, most days Idrive through this neighborhood, gratitude consumesme. I'm 32 years old now with a 3-year-old son, and it'sbeen more than four years since those cold and miserabledays. I've transcended the darkness. TRANSCENDENCE: \u00d2To go beyond the ordinary range of perception.\u00d3 Transcendence is the path to living life from a place where anything is possible. It's the concept of letting goof all the things in us that block us from really living, sowe can make room for enjoyment and peacefulnesswithin ourselves. It's the lifting of our spirits, theuncovering of our hearts to see the truth in all life has tooffer. Living every day with a virus that wants toconsume me and end my time here on earth makestranscendence especially important to me. Transcendence comes at a cost, though. It costs much of what we've become conditioned to. And it costs manyof our past ideas about things \u2014 such as whom we mayblame for our demise, what resentments we may carryabout our past, and any low opinions we may have ofourselves. I've worked with many women (includingmyself) with very low self-esteem. I lived most of my lifebelieving things about myself that caused me to stay stucka life filled with joy and opportunity. Encourage your children, friends, family, even perfect strangers, to do thesame. No matter how corny it sounds, just do it. Do ituntil you believe it. Do you know how beautiful you are?T ell yourself every day until you believe it. Leave yourselfvoice messages, write yourself little notes, get a friend toremind you, yell it from a mountaintop. Do it now beforeyou lose the nerve. Do it every day until you know it! DESIRE: \u00d2To wish or long for; want.\u00d3 Desire is the one thing required to begin any form oftranscendence from any place. Y ou must be willing toleave behind the barriers that are keeping you stuck inorder to move on. This requires only the smallestamount of willingness, which will spring from yourdesire to be free of something. Then you keep puttingone foot in front of the other in the direction of the verything you seek \u2014 a better relationship, peace of mind, ajob, improved health...the choice is yours. Though whatyou let go of may not necessarily go away, transcendencewill leave you with the truth about it. My own past liveswith me now as a reference, a reminder, something to begrateful for...nothing more, nothing less. Last fall, I attended the Voices of Positive Women/ AIDS Committee of T oronto annual women's retreat. Imet women from all over Ontario, some newly diagnosedand some who've been around for years. We ranged inage from early 20s to late 60s. We were a mix of gay,straight and bisexual. We came from various ethnicbackgrounds \u2014 African, Jamaican, Asian, Canadian,American, Indian \u2014 and ate different foods from eachother's cultures. We enjoyed each other's companyimmensely. Besides living with HIV , the commondenominator among us was the desire for transcendence.Not a single one of us was without the determination toturn a seemingly tragic situation into a triumph. My journey with HIV has included addiction, but despair and tragedy can come in any shape or size, somefar more subtle yet still equally despairing and difficultto get through. There is nothing, nothing, nothing, we cannot do. We need only be willing to let go of the past and create thefuture by being in the moment. This moment! And when you give away the inspiration you receive, the world justgoes 'round and 'round. -Transcendence means letting go of where you are in order to reach the place you want to be. I\u00d5ve found that identifying my goals is a great way to map out the path thatwill lead me there. Often, however, setting the goal isn\u00d5tenough. We must examine the steps to reaching this goaland what is required to get there. For me, the art of writingthings down is a ritualistic part of letting them go. So here\u00d5ssomething to try. It\u00d5s an exercise in transcendence, whichhappens by taking steps toward your desires: Get a piece of paper and a pen or pencil (not a computer!). Draw two lines down the page creating threeseparate columns. yColumn 1: Write down your ultimate goal . Don\u00d5t confuse \u00d2ultimate\u00d3 goal with \u00d2step\u00d3 goals. (For example, myultimate goal was to be healthy.) yColumn 2: Write down the step goals you need to set in order to reach your ultimate goal. Step goals are theaction you take to meet your ultimate goal. (Mine includedeating better, quitting smoking and so on.) yColumn 3: Write down all the steps you need to take to reach each step goal. Steps are the action you take toreach your step goals. So, using the same example: ULTIMATE GOAL STEP GOAL-STEPS Better health. 1) eat better see below 2) quit smoking STEPS: 1) eat better \u00d1 find out what foods are good for me, go shopping, ask for support around what I eat from the people I live with 2) quit smoking \u00d1 get the patch or quit cold turkey, join a support group, stay away from smoking areas and/orrestaurants (where, of course, I\u00d5m ordering healthy food!) In Column 3 , each step is where you begin to take action. All too often we burn ourselves out trying to climb themountain when the first step is right in front of us. If wecommit to sticking together through our journeys with HIV,we never, ever have to take that first step alone. For that I continue to be forever grateful. -in a place which afforded me very little room to achieve anything. I believed I was ugly, unintelligent, unworthy ofbeing loved. I believed deep down that I was a failure. These are all lies! I'm none of those things. I had to be willing to let go of these views in order to transcendthem...and be free. Many of us want to be freed \u2014 fromlow opinions of ourselves, unhealthy relationships, harshjudgments of others and ourselves, stress, past wrongs(either done to or by us) and, of course, the big one: HIV . BARRIER: \u00d2A structure built to bar passage\u00d3; \u00d2a boundary or limit\u00d3; \u00d2something that separates us and holds us apart.\u00d3 Most of us tend to get caught up in the barriers in our lives that are outside of ourselves. I spent a long time feelingbitter about who gave me HIV (barrier) and guilty aboutwhom I may have given it to (barrier). I've spent manyhours mulling over resentments about why I got it, why Iwas addicted to crack, why no one seemed to understand,why all my relationships seemed to fail, why I can't do thisand who kept me from doing that (barriers, barriers,barriers...), never really coming up with an answer. Thetruth is, we may never find out the who, what, where, whenor why outside of ourselves. And even if we could accusesomeone, what do you suppose they could do about it? Nomatter who you name as the creator of your despair, there'sonly one who can transcend it \u2014 you! No matter howtragic a situation seems, there is a way to transcend it andmake it valuable.

Not only are we forced to learn about the disease itself, but in many instances we must learn themedical jargon that's associated with it. For those of us who lack a formalized medical education, this is often a difficult process. I rememberlearning early on during childhood that in reference to thehuman body there were usually at least two, sometimesthree, different names for the same part. There was thecommon term we all learned (head, arm, skin, etc.), andthen there was the obscure \"medical term.\" How many ofus remember having this one pulled on us in the thirdgrade? \"Psst! Hey, your epidermis is showing!\" Invariablywe toward our genitals, assumingwe'd left something unzipped, only to have the other kidslaugh and say, \"Epidermis means skin!\" For most of us who didn't pursue a medical career, our vocabulary of medical terminology dropped off after highschool biology class. I recall during the first few years aftermy diagnosis striving to learn as much as I could aboutthe disease. I attended countless medical updates andconferences only to come out feeling more confused thanwhen I went in. What in many cases could have been saidsimply by using good old-fashioned English got twistedaround with medical jargon (I guess it's what separatesthem from us. Talk about a language barrier!). But, before we criticize the medical profession, we must realize that these powerful and, in many cases, brilliantpeople to whom we entrust our lives have spent years, andyears, and years in school learning this stuff. We can'treally expect them to flip back and forth; we need to meetthem halfway. It wasn't until I got a grasp on the lingothey were using that I began to understand what theywere talking about. In doing so, I began to take chargeover my own care.The basics Most medical terminology derives from Latin orGreek. If you didn't take it in school or even if youdid, visit the local library and check out a medicaldictionary (perhaps your doctor will let you borrowone). The Physicians Desk Reference is great to start with. By no means will you become an expertovernight; that takes years. But at least if you canunderstand some of the words and how they'reformed, you'll be well on your way toward makingsense of what you read and hear at conferences andupdates regarding new medications and research. First, take a look at the whole word in question. Let's take the word pancytopenia . Break it down into the various parts: the prefix, root and suffix.Pan is the prefix cyto , referring to cell(s) . And penia is the suffix (meaning a deficiency ). So the definition of pancytopenia: a deficiency of all blood cells . Got it? OK. Let's try another. How about lipodystrophy (everyone's favourite!). Break it down: lipo means fat;trophy is talking about growth or development . And anything with dysmeans abnormal . So there you have it. Lipodystrophy: an abnormal development of fat ! Here's an easy one: carcinogenic .Carcin means cancer ,genic is another way to say causing , so \"cigarettes are carcinogenic,\" right? Ta da! Maybe you're not as enthusiastic about all this as I am. That's OK. I'm sure that as you graduallylearn this stuff, eventually you'll come across one of those words that you hear frequently but neverreally understood, and you'll be able to use thisformat to figure it out and say, \"Ah ha! So that's what that is. Cool.\" -Chattie Catie BASIC TIPS ON UNDERSTANDING MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY Cathy Elliot Olufs is a treatment advocate at Women Alive, a treatment-focused nonprofit by and for women living with HIV/AIDS (www.women-alive.org).

Illustrations by Beverly Deutschterms LIFE ISSUES First and absolutely foremost, all the aspects of a woman's life that affect the likelihood that she will be properly cared for must be addressed.Many women living with HIV are caregivers. Some have jobs where they work long hours. Many have lives that are simply overwhelmed by the demands of daily living, to which HIV adds another huge burden. Theresult may be that taking care of themselves \u2014 body, mind and heart \u2014may go by the wayside. And that absolutely must not happen. Mardge Cohen, MD, the director of Women's HIV Research and the senior physician at Cook County Hospital in Chicago, says, \"The biggestissue that women with HIV face is how many issues they face. Managingtheir medication regimens as well as their jobs and families, worrying abouttransmission to others, recovering from the difficulties of disclosure, andmanaging other medical and gynecologic problems are all major issues. Forsome women, the combination of these medical and psychosocial problemscan be quite devastating.\" It is estimated that worldwide almost two-thirds of women with HIV/AIDS are caring for at least one child under the age of 16, and forWomen are different from men. Wow, aren\u00d5t you glad you decided to read this article? Though this fact may seem obvious, too often in the world of AIDSit\u00d5s been ignored. Although early concerns that HIV+ women might progress to AIDSmore quickly than men have been laid to rest, there are many other ways in whichwomen do, indeed, differ. In order to obtain the best possible treatment for yourdisease, it is crucially important to be well informed about these issues. Here are ahalf-dozen things that women wishing to live long and well with HIV should consider.TREATMENT INFORMATION FOR WOMEN LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS2. SPRING 2003 19THE POSITIVE SIDE18HIV/AIDS issues, particularly because of the possibility of interactions between antiretroviralsand psychiatric medications. As well, he said, themental strain of living longer with the diseasecreates other concerns such as work-related issues.In addition to these problems, women with HIVtend to feel isolated and alone, and may feelashamed or fearful about revealing their diagnosisto others. For all these reasons, providing women with emotional support and therapy is very importantto increase their ability to manage the disease. Inaddition to psychotherapy and medications, manywomen have found help from exercise, mindfulnesstechniques (such as yoga and meditation), having a pet and HIV support groups. Available in manycities, women's support groups are a great place to exchange information and get the emotionalsharing and hugs that too many HIV+ womenmight otherwise not get. Call your local AIDSservice organization to find out if there is asupport group for women with HIV near you (and check the resource list on the back page). Under One RoofIn order to better provide all of the above, Victoria Cargill, MD, director of Clinical Studiesand director of Minority Research at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's Office of AIDSResearch, is a strong advocate of \"one-stopshopping\" care for women: \"One-stop shoppingmeans that a woman will be best served if she canget all her treatment needs met in one location.Her medical care and her substance-abusetreatment will be taken care of in the same place.Better still if social services are on site and theplace provides child care. Then all of her needs arehoused under one roof. It will be so much easierfor her to get where she needs to go, and muchmore likely that she'll be engaged becauseeverything she needs is right there. Not to mentionthat she won't have to run from one end of town to the other \u2014 catching buses, paying car fare anddragging her children around \u2014 all at times whenshe may not even be feeling well.\" Having such care centres available to women could greatly increase the chances that women will be ableto address all the treatment issues discussed here \u2014and it's sure something that HIV treatment advocatesshould be campaigning for all over Canada. Dr. Berger believes that the 410 Sherbourne Health Centre at St. Michael's Hospital in T orontocomes very close to this model. \"At our community-based clinic we provide HIV care,primary care and a methadone clinic,\" he says.\"On staff we have HIV primary care physicians,methadone-prescribing physicians, addictioncounselors, and two nurses and a pharmacist whoall specialize in HIV . We also have a full-time HIVsocial worker, along with a half-time HIV dietitianand a half-time occupational therapist.\" At the Centre, it isn't necessarily a physician who is the primary contact person. Although allpatients see a physician at least six times yearly,each patient chooses whom they'll have primarycontact with for day-to-day care issues. Foremergencies, there's a 24-hour telephone service foranyone requiring immediate help, and the staff istrained to immediately refer all PHAs to someoneknowledgeable about their care. Dr. Berger says,\"It's an example of a truly interdisciplinary servicewhere patients have access to all their outpatientneeds. We provide a way for women to get all thehelp they need in one day in one location.\" Forpatients who are in extreme financial difficulty,there's even a Patient Comfort Fund, which canprovide medications or meet other patient needs ona temporary basis. INFECTIONS AND CONDITIONS: DIFFERENCES IN WOMEN Both HIV itself and the many other infections that may at some point be unwelcome visitorsto people living with this disease can have differing characteristics in women and men. HIV ItselfHIV+ women tend to have a lower viral load over time when compared to men with similar CD4 cell counts. Researchers have proposed that this should be taken intoconsideration when doctors are making decisionsabout starting antiretroviral therapy. Since thecurrent treatment guidelines put more emphasison CD4 counts (with a general acceptance thattherapy should be delayed until CD4 cells dropbelow 350) rather than viral load, this may beunlikely to change treatment decisions for mostwomen. However, it's always important to watchfor new information on such issues and anychanges that might be made in future \"expertpanel\" recommendations.Opportunistic and Other InfectionsWomen tend to develop the same types of opportunistic infections (OIs) as men, and in about the samefrequencies, but there are several important exceptions. Women have higher rates of esophageal candidiasis (yeast in the throat), bacterial pneumonia and difficult-to-treat(refractory) herpes simplex virus infections. Any newsymptoms should always be reported to your doctor so thatsuch infections can be caught early and treated as soon aspossible. In addition, although bacterial pneumonia can occur at any CD4 count, chronic yeast problems and refractory herpes problems tend to occur in those with a loss of immune function. Thus, the occurrence of these and certain other infections could be seen as a warning sign that the immune system needs help. For example, recurrent vaginal yeast infections are far too common and are often the first sign of compromised immunefunction. Although it's a very effective drug for suppressingthese infections, studies show a high incidence of fluconazole(Diflucan) resistance with long-term prophylactic use, sodoctors have sought other approaches for controlling the yeastybeasties. McGill University researcher Mona Loutfy, MD, MPH,says, \"I'd start with topical treatment for yeast infections. Ifthere is no response, a longer-course treatment of fluconazoleoften works. However, the best management for recurrent yeastinfections is antiretroviral therapy for managing HIV infectionand improving the immune system. If this is done, often theproblem with recurrent yeast infections goes away.\" Reducingsugar (yeast's favorite food) in the diet, as well as eating yogurtor taking acidophilus supplements may also help. Gynecologic ProblemsThere are many gynecologic problems that may occur. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs, like chlamydia,gonorrhea and syphilis) and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID, a serious, potentially life-threatening inflammatorycondition in the genital tract, often caused by STDs) arecommon in PHAs. So, screening for these is a must, both upondiagnosis and any time that symptoms appear that mightindicate an infection (pain, cramping, itching, burning, vaginaldischarge or odour, painful urination, fever). PID is more likelyto lead to complications in HIV+ women than in their negativesisters. It can cause abdominal pain (sometimes severe), fever,discharge, painful urination, cramping and nausea, and mustbe treated very quickly with appropriate antibiotics. Human papilloma virus (HPV , the virus that causes cervical and anal cancer) infection and cervical or anal dysplasia (theearly changes in cells that may lead to cancer) are common inPHAs. Dr. Loutfy recommends doing cervical Pap smears everysix months to screen for changes. She points out that recentsome this is a task they do alone. In addition, some women areproviding care for partners, grandchildren and/or other familymembers. The emotional focus for many women is caring fortheir children, a role that may be even more difficult than usualwhen one or more have HIV . In this setting, many women needto be reminded that if they don't care for themselves, they maynot be able to continue caring for others. It has been found that after HIV diagnosis, women are less likely to use existing HIV care programs, services and therapiesinitially, and less likely to maintain care down the line. Thus,identifying any barriers to following through on care andaddressing practical issues related to obtaining care is veryimportant. Phil Berger, MD, chief of the Department of Familyand Community Medicine at St. Michael's Hospital andassociate professor at the University of T oronto, says, \"Womenneed to discuss with their doctors and case managers all thepossible ways to get the support they need in order to receivegood medical care in the most efficient manner.\" This mayinclude financial and housing assistance, child care andtransportation to and from medical facilities. For womendealing with issues such as substance use, domestic violenceand homelessness, it may also include seeking support fromfamily members and friends in order to improve their chancesfor following through with medical appointments and, forthose on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART),maintaining good adherence to antiretroviral drugs. Attention must also be paid to problems created by substance abuse and domestic violence. Insufficient treatment for drugproblems can create a huge barrier against obtaining properlong-term HIV care. Researchers from the U.S. Women'sInteragency HIV Study (WIHS), a cohort that has provided thelargest database on women with HIV in the U.S., have foundthat two-thirds of these women have a history of domesticviolence at some point in their lives, and 20% have experiencedit recently. Almost one-third have experienced childhood sexualabuse, and these women are more likely to have drug abuse orpsychiatric problems. It is very clear that partner violence is aserious problem among HIV+ women. All such issues absolutelymust be addressed in order to increase the chances that womenwill obtain the best possible health care for this disease. Second that EmotionSome women may also need to ask for help getting psychiatric therapy or counseling. At a meeting last year ofthe Canadian Psychiatric Association, Ken Citron, MD, staff psychiatrist at the Psychiatric Clinic for HIV-RelatedConcerns at T oronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, noted that peoplewith HIV/AIDS (PHAs) have a higher incidence of mentalhealth problems \u2014 including depression and memory orthinking problems related to the disease's effects on the brain \u2014than the general population. He said that treating PHAsrequires a certain amount of specialized knowledge about For more in-depth info, see CATIE\u00d5s Fact Sheets on \u00d2Complications in Women\u00d3 at www.catie.ca/facts.nsf 3 . SPRING 2003 21THE POSITIVE SIDE20research has shown that, used in conjunction with Pap smears,screening for HPV (with a blood test) is both helpful and costeffective for cervical cancer screening, although it is not thestandard of care in Canada. Any abnormalities found with Papsmears would require follow-up testing with colposcopy(microscopic examination) and biopsies (tissue samples),perhaps followed by more frequent Pap smears. Based on themost recent research, experts in the field believe that low-gradecervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL, early changes in cells) don't warrant treatment because the rate ofprogression is slow and spontaneous regression (improvementwithout treatment) often occurs. However, high-grade lesions(HSIL) should be treated. Treatment is aimed at destroying theabnormal tissue so it doesn't progress to cancer. Possibletreatment options include: LEEP (removes abnormal tissuewith a wire loop); cone biopsy (removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix by surgery or laser; frequently used to treat high-grade dysplasia in HIV+ women); electrocautery(burning); and topical solutions. The use of intravaginal 5-flourouracil is often recommended to reduce recurrence after the initial treatment. Effective HAART has been shown to slow the growth of cervical lesions and even to result in regression, so this wouldbe another consideration when making decisions aboutstarting antiretrovirals. For some women with low-gradelesions, starting antiretrovirals may be all that's needed. Inaddition, smoking is strongly tied to an increased risk forcervical cancer. In one study, HPV-infected women whosmoked one or more packs of cigarettes a day were four timesas likely as nonsmokers to develop precancerous or cancerouschanges in the cervix. So, need we say it? Throw away the evilweed. Talk to your doctor about finding ways to help you buttout. Although anal HPV infection and dysplasia are also verycommon in HIV+ women (and men), there are no standardrecommendations for anal Pap smears. However, some expertsin this field believe that they, too, should become routine. Lastbut not least, recent research has shown that immunizationusing an experimental vaccine against HPV type 16, the mostcommon cause of cervical cancers, prevents both infection withthe virus and the cervical changes that could lead to cancer.Although the vaccine is not yet approved, its comingavailability may spell the end for cervical cancer worries inthose not yet infected with HPV . ANTIRETROVIRALS:EFFECTS AND SIDEEFFECTS IN WOMEN Overall, women respond the same as men do toantiretroviral treatment, getting the same benefits interms of reduced viral load and increased CD4 cells. However, the same may not be true when it comes to drug sideeffects. Alas, much of the information we have about sideeffects comes from the clinical trials that are carriedout during the drug approval process.Unfortunately, very few women were included inthese trials in earlier days, andeven in the recent past thepercentage of women inmany studies has beenlow. The result hasbeen that we don'thave clearly definedinformation on the differencesbetween men and women when it comes to the side effectsof many drugs,including not onlyantiretrovirals butalso drugs used totreat other infectionsor problems. However,based on both the mostrecent trials and feedback from the community, it appears that women may developdifferent antiretroviral side effects, or at a higher orlower rate when compared to men. Various studieshave shown the following: yThe non-nuke nevirapine (Viramune) and possibly other non-nukes may be more likely to cause a rash in women,and the rash may be more severe than it commonly is inmen. Nevirapine may also clear more slowly from women\u00d5sbodies, potentially increasing the risk of liver toxicity. yWomen may experience more gastrointestinal side effects with protease inhibitors. yAlthough the overall incidence is rare, researchers have found that overweight women over 40 years are more likelyto develop lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threateningcondition which has been linked to toxicity to themitochondria (the energy factories inside cells) caused by nukes (such as AZT, ddI, d4T, 3TC and abacavir).Preliminary research indicates that there may even be an overall increased risk for lactic acidosis in women, ingeneral. The risk also increases if a woman is pregnant. yThere are differences in the likelihood that women will develop certain lipodystrophy-associated symptoms. yOverall, there is an increased likelihood that women on HAART will experience more neurologic problems (such asnerve damage). 620; Viral load: undetectable. Volunteer at Voices of Positive Women, Canadian HIV Trials Network, Canadian AIDS Society, Ontario AIDS Network. Recipient of the Golden Jubilee Medal of Queen Elizabeth II. Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario Not only in HIV but in all health-related issues, women seem to come last. Thehealth care system often doesn\u00d5t realize that women are caregivers and don\u00d5t have time for themselves. Women need support. Health care professionals have torecognize that gender differences are huge issues. For example, in women, somemedications can cause severe life-threatening side effects that don\u00d5t occur in men.We also need to recognize within the HIV community that women are different frommen. We\u00d5re different in the way we grow up, our societal expectations are different,and we\u00d5re still generally paid less then men. The majority of clinical trials are done in men. Whetherthis is because women can get pregnant or simplybecause they don\u00d5t have access \u2014whatever the issues are, they must be addressed. We need accurateinformation on how the medications work in women.What are the right dosages for women? How do HIVmeds affect women in menopause? One of the many reasons that women aren\u00d5tparticipating in clinical trials is because the trialsthemselves are not made accessible to them. Manywomen live in poverty and can\u00d5t afford childcare, andthus cannot dedicate the necessary time to spend at ahealth care facility that doesn\u00d5t provide childcare.Covering travel expenses should also be considered as a way to encourage women\u00d5s participation. Professionals working in the field shouldbe made aware of these differences. In order to empower women and improve theirquality of life, they should know about the choices they have. Some important questions to ask if and when you decide to participate in aclinical trial: yHow long will it take? yWhat types of lab work will be carried out? yWhen will the diagnostic testing be done? yHow are they going to monitor the participants? yWhen will I receive the results? yWhat are the inclusion and exclusion criteria? You should also know your rights. By participating in a clinical trial or deciding to withdraw from one, your health care will not be compromised. With more women participating in clinical trials, we\u00d5ll be able to show anydifferences in disease progression and care between men and women, improvewomen\u00d5s lives, and help women learn how to take control of their health care and make effective and important decisions that are right for them. We\u00d5ll also have more data about side effects, dosage, viral load and HIV progression that\u00d5sspecific to females. This knowledge will help many women see for themselves thechoice of drugs available and the importance of following their drug regimen,without just blindly accepting what their doctor says. We are not men. We are a different and distinct group and we should be heard. Many clinical trials are not widely advertised, so women don\u00d5t know about them.It\u00d5s important to provide more info on clinical trials and their importance, in orderto dispel fears about being guinea pigs.

SPRING 2003 23tomography) scans (another kind of X-ray), and whole body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)screening. Because of high cost, MRIs and CTscans are not commonly used. Some doctors do theless expensive DEXA scans before patients beginHAART and at regular intervals afterwards in orderto monitor body changes precisely. However,because this involves repeated radiation exposure,it's important to discuss the pros and cons of suchtesting with your doctor. Approaches to addressing these symptoms include attempting to counter the cause(s) as wellas using therapies aimed at the symptom itself.Because it is thought that fat loss is predominantlytied to the adverse effects that nukes have on themitochondria (the energy factories in cells),nutrient therapies that help support the mitochon-dria (B vitamins, antioxidants, coenzyme Q 10and the amino acid L-carnitine) may help prevent thedevelopment of thisproblem. For thosewith loss,there acid) orfat (taken from theperson's own body),that can help restore a normal facialappearance. For those with fat accumulation,human growth hormone (Serostim) is ofteneffective. Insulin-sensitizing therapies may not onlyhelp reverse blood glucose problems but also mayhelp to lessen or reverse fat accumulation. Surgerycan be used to reduce breast size, and liposuction iseffective for buffalo humps and lipomas. Exercisecan help lower blood fats and improve insulinsensitivity, although its effect on fat accumulationis usually minimal. Because protease inhibitors appear to be associated with fat accumulation and elevatedblood fats, drug switches are sometimes tried forthese problems. It appears that substituting a non-nuke or a nuke for a protease inhibitor willhelp lower blood fats, although the effects so farseen on reducing fat accumulation have not beenimpressive. Drug therapies, nutrient therapies and dietary changes may also help lower blood fats. (For more info on all of these therapies forlipodystrophy symptoms, see CATIE's Practical Guide to HIV Drug Side Effects .)BONE PROBLEMS There is growing concern about the occurrence of bone problems in PHAs. Osteopenia (a reduction in bone mineraldensity that may lead to osteoporosis), osteoporosis (thinning and weakening of the bones that may cause fractures)and osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue that can cause pain andstiffness and may require hip replacement) are being diagnosedin more and more people. Because bone problems take longer todevelop than other symptoms, it's not yet clear whether womendevelop these problems at rates higher than those seen in men.However, women have a generally higher risk of developingosteoporosis anyway, so there is concern that this may become asignificant problem for many women with HIV , especially aftermenopause. A DEXA scan is used for the diagnosis of osteo-porosis. A comprehensive physical exam followed, if appropriate,by an MRI scan of the bone is needed to diagnose osteonecrosis. Many factors may contribute to the development of bone problems. HIV infection itself leads to suppressed bone growthand increased bone loss, possibly through the production of pro-inflammatory chemicals that are part of thebody's immune response to the virus. Natural anti-inflammatories contained in fish oil (2 capsules,three times daily with meals) or flaxseed oil (2 capsules, three times daily with meals) or ginger(2 capsules, three times daily with meals, or gingertea made from chopped ginger root) or curcumin(500 mg capsule, three to four times daily) may beuseful. Suppressing the virus with antiretroviralsappears to help normalize these bone processes, but in a Catch-22, protease inhibitors have been tied to an increasedrisk of both osteoporosis and osteonecrosis. For women withalready present bone problems, this might be an importantconsideration in choosing medications. Lowered levels of hormones, including estrogen, testosterone and DHEA, can also contribute to osteoporosis, makinghormone testing and possible replacement therapy veryimportant ( see next page ). Nutrient deficiencies that are common in HIV disease may leave the body with insufficientbuilding blocks for bone. A nutrient-rich diet combined withsupplementation with calcium (1,000-1,500 mg), magnesium(500 mg; excess magnesium can cause loose stools so beware),and vitamin D (800 IU daily) may help to counter this.Co-infection with hepatitis B or C greatly increases the risk ofosteoporosis, with the likelihood of bone problems becomingever greater as liver disease advances. This is another factor toconsider in making choices about treatment of these infections.Other risk factors include smoking, lack of weight-bearingexercise, overuse of alcohol, thyroid problems, adrenal glandabnormalities, and long-term use of corticosteroid drugs. Forthose concerned about their bones, it's important to eliminate as many of these as possible. Try to quit smoking, exercise THE POSITIVE SIDE22There may be other differences about which we know little, if anything, because of the lack of research or because the differences are not obvious enough to have reachedwidespread community awareness. It is not clear what the cause(s) of these differences are. It's possible that some things are genetically determined,and there is ongoing research to study this. It's possible thatwomen's hormones affect the way that the body handles drugs.Researchers believe that estrogens (sex hormones that womenproduce) may reduce the breakdown of drugs in the liver.Changes in hormones at different phases of a woman'smenstrual cycle may also affect the breakdown of drugs. This may also be a case where size matters. For example, women's livers are smaller than men's. This may mean thatbreaking down drugs puts a greater burden on a woman's liver.Because a drug is given with a standard expectation for how longit will take for the liver to break it down, if this process isn'tworking properly, the result may be that too much drug remainsin the bloodstream for too long, which increases the likelihoodof drug side effects. In addition, women generally weigh lessthan men. The result may be that standard drug doses are toohigh to begin with in many women, another factor that couldcreate a higher likelihood of toxicity. Women also generally havea higher percentage of body fat than men, another factor thatmay cause differences in how drugs work in their bodies. For these reasons, there's a movement toward doing therapeutic drug monitoring \u2014 measuring the level of a drugin the blood at certain points after the drug is taken in order to see if it's reaching a desirable therapeutic level, or one that is too high (increasing the chance of toxicity) or too low(reducing its effectiveness). The results of this testing could be used to adjust the dosage to one that is high enough to beeffective but not so high as to increase the likelihood of toxicityand side effects. Some doctors are beginning to use this druglevel testing, but it is not yet widely available in Canada. None of these differences mean that women should avoid taking HAART. The benefits for women who have reached thepoint where antiretroviral therapy is needed clearly stilloutweigh the risks. However, women should always ask forcomplete information on any possible side effects that couldresult from any medications being given and immediately reportto their doctors any new symptoms that develop, not only in theperiod immediately after starting or changing a medication butat any point down the line when a new problem occurs. Alwayslet your doctor determine whether this or that symptom mightbe drug-related and might therefore necessitate a drug switch.It's also very important for women to ask for and receive regularlab tests that could indicate drug toxicity or side effects. Includedwould be very regular monitoring of liver enzymes, kidneyfunction tests, and the levels of fats (cholesterol and triglyc-erides) and sugar (glucose) in the blood. It's important to set upappointments for obtaining these tests before drugs are started.LIPODYSTROPHY Symptoms associated with lipodystrophy maydevelop differently in women than in men. Thissyndrome can cause a wide variety of body changes, including fat accumulation (in the bellyand breasts, behind the neck, and in the form offatty tumours on the limbs), fat loss (in the arms,legs, face and buttocks), and elevated blood fats andblood sugar. Although any or all of these can occurin both sexes, women appear to be more likely todevelop significantly increased breast size andabdominal fat accumulation. The weight gain may be more pronounced in women who wereoverweight to begin with but can occur even inwomen who were initially quite thin. Some womendevelop so much additional belly fat that it'scommon for them to be mistaken for beingpregnant. Just as with women who really arepregnant, they may develop serious back pain fromthe additional abdominal weight. They may alsodevelop digestive problems because of the excess fat pressing down on their stomachs. Some women also see their arms, legs and buttocks shrink, while their faces become ever moregaunt. The combination of these body changes canbe emotionally devastating. Some women feel thattheir ability to lead a normal life has been takenaway. Many feel that the body changes have becomea marker for being HIV+, \"outing\" them to theworld. \"T oo many of my patients feel that they havebecome marked women,\" Dr. Berger says. Inaddition to all these problems, women may also bemore likely than men to develop increased bloodglucose, although perhaps less likely to experienceelevated blood fats. In the WIHS cohort,preliminary data has shown an increase in cases ofdiabetes in women of colour who are on HAART. It's very important to have regularly scheduled blood tests to look for any negative changes. Interms of body changes, standards for regularassessments have not been established, but possiblemonitoring tools include: self-observation (whichhas been found to be very accurate overall); photostaken of the body at several different angles(beginning at HIV diagnosis and at regular intervalsafter that); measurements using calipers to measureskin-fold thickness and tape measures to determinearm, thigh, waist and hip circumference. T echnologically, more sophisticated tests that can show changes in body fat include DEXA scans (akind of X-ray), cross-sectional CT (computed NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES THAT ARE COMMON IN HIVDISEASE MAY LEAVE THEBODY WITH INSUFFICIENTBUILDING BLOCKS FOR BONE.

SPRING 2003 25HORMONES Research has shown that HIV infection can affect the body's ability to maintain normallevels of hormones \u2014 the chemical messengers produced by glands that affectcountless aspects of body function. Four of thehormones most commonly affected are:testosterone, DHEA, estrogen and progesterone.These hormones normally stay in balance witheach other, and a drop in one can adversely affectthe levels of others. Hormonal inadequacy orimbalance can have many negative results,including menstrual problems, moodiness,depression, fatigue, inability to build muscle,wasting, sleep problems, loss of fertility, vaginalchanges (often dryness and thinning of the vaginaltissue), loss of bone density (which can lead toosteoporosis) and, last but definitely not least, lossof sex drive and difficulty with achieving orgasm.Far too often, these are ignored or written off asjust \"living with HIV\" when, in fact, they are veryimportant symptoms that should point toward theneed for testing hormone levels and doingappropriate replacement therapy where needed. Although testosterone is normally thought of as the male sex hormone, women also need it forproper sexual function and drive, as well as tomaintain muscles, weight and energy, and toprevent depression and mood changes. Lowtestosterone appears to be more common in post-menopausal women, those with low CD4 counts,and those who are experiencing wasting. Inaddition to the effects of HIV , certain drugssometimes used in the treatment of forwomen's testosterone levels, experts say that beingon the low end of normal may not besufficient for eliminating symptoms.According to Jon Kaiser, MD, aCalifornia doctor with a large HIVpractice who has researched 1.0 to 2.0ng/dl. If levels are below this \u2014especially if you're experiencingsymptoms like loss of sex drive,depression and/or loss of muscles or weight or have been diagnosed with bone loss \u2014 it would be very important todiscuss replacement therapy with your doctor. Many women have found that their sex drive, capacity for orgasm, energy leveland overall feeling of mental and physical well-being improveremarkably when their testosterone levels are normalized. A replacement option for women is the use of testosterone gels or creams which can be prepared by a compounding pharmacist (a pharmacist who mixes up a potion for you with differentexisting drugs) in the dosage needed to restore optimal levels.Women's individual needs will vary, but most women get goodresults with a cream that contains 5 mg in 1/4teaspoon. The 1/4teaspoon is applied to rotating skin sites (wherever the skin is thin but over a fat-containing part of the body, such as the innerarm, inner thigh or abdomen), twice a day for a total daily dose of10 mg. T estosterone levels should be re-tested after a month of useto see if the level has been normalized without being raised toomuch. Overdoing testosterone can cause acne as well asmasculinization (facial hair, deepening voice, increased clitoral size)that may not be fully reversible, so follow-up testing is a must. DHEA is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that has been found to be low in women at all stages of HIV disease.Maintaining optimal levels can have positive effects on sex drive,energy level, mood, bone health and muscle mass. Expertsrecommend testing the DHEA-sulfate blood level and, wherenecessary, doing replacement therapy sufficient to restore anoptimal level (in the upper half of the normal range, usually100-300 micrograms/dl). Depending on the initial blood level,Dr. Kaiser recommends beginning with 10-25 mg of oral DHEAper day and then increasing, if necessary, to reach the optimal level. The female hormones estrogen and progesterone may also be too low in many women, and the result can be menstrualirregularities, perimenopause (the stage that precedes menopauseand may last for many years in some women) or menopause(when the menstrual cycle ceases). One study found that two-thirds of HIV+ women experience irregular periods, skippedperiods or vaginal spotting (bleeding between periods), and thatthe menstrual irregularities appear to be associated with diseaseprogression. Menstrual periods may become irregular and bloodflow may be either lighter or heavier than in the past. Heavier bleeding can worsen anemia and so should always be addressed. Studies have shown that women using the protease inhibitors ritonavir (Norvir) or saquinavir (Invirase or Fortovase) or a combination of the two may experience longer periods. (Note that although anemia may only be mild in some women, it can develop into a very serious problem in others and should always be carefully treated. For more info on ways to address this problem, see CATIE's Practical Guide to HIV Drug Side Effects .) In many women, symptoms of pre- menstrual syndrome (PMS) can become THE POSITIVE SIDE24regularly, avoid over-consumption of alcohol, andtreat hormone problems appropriately. Regularweight-bearing exercise (such as walking or weight-training) is particularly important for anyoneconcerned about bone health. It's the stress of yourbody weight coming down on your bones whenyou're exercising that actually stimulates bonegrowth. So just do it. There are also possible drug therapies. The use of alendronate (Fosamax) and risedronate(Actonel), two drugs used to treat osteoporosis inpost-menopausal women, has not been studied inpre-menopausal women with bone loss, but somehealth care providers are now prescribing them for HIV+ women who have low bone density.Raloxifene (Evista) is a selective estrogen receptormodulator (SERM) that may help to counter boneloss in women with low estrogen, without the risksof hormone replacement therapy. Remember toalways consider drug interactions and side effectsbefore taking any new medication. There are alsotwo alternative therapies that may have benefit.Although not yet studied in PHAs, ipriflavone, asoy-derived bioflavonoid, has been shown in severalstudies to increase bone density in HIV negativepeople. Naturopathic doctors have reported goodresults in relieving bone pain with the use of aTraditional Chinese Medicine product calledMarrow Plus, a combination of codonopsis andother herbs that is given in doses of three to fourcapsules, several times daily. Herbs can also interactwith medications, so if you're on HAART, ask yourdoctor or pharmacist about this.

Louise , count: 770; Viral load: undetectable. Chair of Voices of Positive Women and the Canadian Treatment Advocates Council, co-chair of the Ministerial Council on HIV/AIDS. Recipient of the Golden JubileeMedal of Queen Elizabeth II. Toronto, Ontario The most important thing is the concept of getting control of your life and feeling a sense of control. I think that starts with a recognition that we do not control many things that happen to us in our lives. What we always docontrol is how we decide to respond to those things. The more we recognize that that\u00d5s where the real control centre is, thehealthier we\u00d5ll be as human beings. That\u00d5s what lifehas taught me. So, with this disease: You have the disease, you don\u00d5t control that. You have only so many options of howyou can deal with the disease. But the control youhave is in learning everything you can about thedisease and the options available to you to stayhealthy. Then you can take control of making theright choices for you. With that also comes control of sickness, not only of treatment in the allopathic or Western medicinesense, but in the sense that people are treatment,too. People are part of our health system. The people you keep around you have got to nurture and nourish you and keep youhealthy. If we stay in violent or unhealthy relationships, that takes control awayand it takes health away. At times when things feel like they\u00d5re spiraling out control, I take myself back to remembering the areas where I am exercising control. So, I make sure thatI\u00d5m taking my meds, doing my exercise and eating and sleeping in a healthyway. The other thing I do is literally push through. A therapist once said to me:\u00d2Sometimes you have to fake it until you can really feel it.\u00d3 And that\u00d5s what Ido. I remind myself of the things over which I\u00d5m still exercising control, andthen I fake feeling good. It sounds strange, but I carry on as if I\u00d5m feeling fine,and then it actually becomes the reality. The pretense at the beginningbecomes the reality, and I push through and push forward again. I think it\u00d5sthe way to go, it\u00d5s the only way I know. Otherwise, we\u00d5re just completelybogged down and we lose our sense of self and our sense of being centered,and that\u00d5s what we have to keep coming back to. - Provided by Hazra, cerified aromatherapistPhoto: Jake PetersSPRING 2003 27regular, reasonably light menstrual bleeding. This can be very useful for those at risk of anemia. It's important to remember that many antiretrovirals interact with ethinyl-estradiol, themain ingredient in side effects. Y ourdoctor and/or pharmacist will have to determine if using any of these drugs in combination withbirth control pills will require changing the dose of the birth control pills in order to maintaineffectiveness or reduce side effects. Another formof contraception may be needed when dosageadjustments are not possible. For the lower, more physiologically appropriate replacement amounts of hormones normallyconsidered appropriate for perimenopausal ormenopausal women, compounding pharmacists canmake up hormone-containing creams or gels. Forperimenopause, it is common for doctors toprescribe a 10 %progesterone cream, 100 mg (1/4teaspoon) twice daily, applied topically on the chest, abdomen, inner thigh or inner forearm duringDays 14 through 28 of the menstrual cycle. For thosein menopause, most experts recommend the use of a soybean plant-derived triest (containing threeestrogens) cream in a concentration of 2.5 mg/gram.A 1/4teaspoon of cream is normally rubbed in wherever the skin is thin, twice a day, although theamount can be adjusted based on what's necessary torelieve symptoms. It is thought best to combine thiswith progesterone, used as discussed above, in orderto lessen cancer risk and increase bone growth. Formore info on hormone testing and replacement inwomen, an excellent resource is Healing HIV: How To Rebuild Your Immune System by Jon Kaiser, MD, available at www.jonkaiser.com. In addition to HRT, certain dietary changes as well as nutrient supplementation can often greatlyreduce or eliminate both menstrual and meno-pausal symptoms. Vitamin E (1,200-2,000 IUdaily) is particularly useful for eliminating hotflashes and sweats, as well as painful or swollenbreasts. Magnesium (500 mg daily) can greatlydecrease cramping and irritability. Calcium (1,500mg daily), vitamin B 6(50 mg, three times daily) and potassium (eat high-potassium fruits likebananas, melons and oranges, and leafy greens such as spinach) can reduce water retention and moodiness. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) found in borage oil or evening primroseoil (480 mg daily) may help with both the emotional andphysical symptoms of PMS. Reducing salt in your diet will also help cut down on PMS-associated water retention and the bloating sensation thatmany women feel. Cutting back on caffeine can help decreaseanxiety and irritability. Because caffeine may exacerbatefibrocystic breast disease (painful lumps) \u2014 a condition thatmay worsen around menstruation \u2014 cutting out caffeine-containing coffees, teas, colas and chocolate may beparticularly important for women with this problem. Alcoholhas been shown to worsen headaches, fatigue and depression in those with PMS, so if it's part of your life, cutting it outduring the premenstrual week might be helpful. MassachusettsInstitute of T echnology (MIT) researchers have found thatconsuming a combination of carbohydrates that results in anincrease in serotonin in the brain can help reduce tension,depression, anger and confusion in PMS'ing women. Anycombination of foods that raises the blood level of the aminoacid tryptophan will work because it, in turn, stimulates theproduction of serotonin. Low-fat, high-carbohydrate foods likehot cereal or toast with jam, as well as the protein foods thatare high in tryptophan (such as dairy products and turkey) can all work to boost serotonin levels and, thus, your mood. Exercise may help some women through its ability to raise the feel-good chemicals, called endorphins, in the brain. And,last but not least, energy therapies like acupuncture or Reikican often very quickly relieve menstrual pain and cramps.Consult a practitioner and you may soon find that very simpletechniques can banish menstrual miseries. ConclusionAll of this might make managing HIV disease seemoverwhelmingly difficult for women, but many do itremarkably well. Dr. Cohen says, \"I am always moved by how strong and nurturing the women I care for are, especiallyconsidering how many obstacles they've faced and how manythey still have to face.\" By keeping up to date on the latesttreatment information, seeking the best available care andsupport for obtaining it, and remembering that caring foryourself may be the best gift you can give to others who needyou, women can greatly increase their chances for continuingto overcome those obstacles and, thus, be able to live both longand well with HIV . - THE POSITIVE SIDE26more intense, including water retention, abdominal cramps, leg and back pain, swelling and pain in the breasts, irritability,headaches, moodiness, anxiety and depression. Over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)may help relieve some of these symptoms. Some HIV+ womengo into perimenopause or menopause much earlier than iscommon in their HIV negative sisters. During perimenopause,the menstrual cycle may become shorter or there may beskipped periods or heavier-than-normal bleeding. Somewomen will develop atrophic vaginitis, a condition in whichthe vaginal tissue thins due to lack of estrogen and there isirritation and dryness. Other symptoms may include hotflashes, night sweats, insomnia, irritability and lowered sexdrive, often occurring even while the woman is still havingperiods. The same symptoms can occur during menopause, astage that HIV+ women may reach five to 10 years earlier thanis usual. (Menopause normally begins between the ages of 40and 55. It is a slow and gradual process that occurs over threeto five years. Menopause is complete when you haven'tmenstruated for 12 months in a row.) Because some of these symptoms can be caused by HIV itself or other serious conditions or infections, it is veryimportant for aggressive diagnosis to be carried out in order to determine all the possible causes. This should include: ya complete physical ya pelvic exam ya Pap smear and/or colposcopy yscreening for infections yblood count and chemistry and pregnancy test forheterosexually active women ya review of menstrual history and current medications, along withany history of other drug use ytesting of hormone levels As a minimum, for proper diagnosis of perimenopause, menopause and hormoneimbalances, the following tests should be done: blood levels ofFSH, estradiol and testosterone. The tests must be done duringthe correct days of the menstrual cycle in order to interpretthem properly. Day 1 of the menstrual cycle is the very firstday you see even a small spot of blood, even if full-blownbleeding doesn't occur for another day or so. The blood for allthree tests should be drawn on one of the days from Day 2 toDay 4 of the cycle. An FSH level greater than 35-40 IU for twomonths indicates menopause. An FSH level of greater than 20IU for two months indicates perimenopause. An estradiol levelthat is either too low or too high sugg ests a hormonal imbalance and may indicate perimenopause. If tests determine that symptoms are being caused by hormone changes, replacement therapy can be considered.Short-term hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be recommended for those with disablingmenopausal or perimenopausal symptoms, since itwill usually relieve those symptoms. However, themost recent research shows that long-term HRT(especially for more than five years) not only doesnot provide all the benefits it was once thought to(such as protection against cardiovascular disease),it may actually confer serious risks for heart attacks,strokes and cancer. Thus, many experts now leantoward avoiding long-term HRT, if possible.However, all aspects of an individual woman's case must be considered. For example, it is clear that in HIV negative post- menopausal women, HRT can help preventosteoporosis. Because there is growing concernabout bone loss in HIV disease, in general, andHIV+ women may go through menopause at muchearlier than usual ages, the lack of appropriatehormones over a lengthy period of time mightultimately contribute significantly to worsening theosteoporosis problems. In a woman with a familyhistory of osteoporosis or who already has signs ofbone loss, this might be of particular concern. On the other hand, there is a possibility that replacing hormones might increase the risk ofbreast, uterine or ovarian cancer. Since HIV+women may already be at increased risk forcancer due to compromised immune function,the possibility that HRT could worsen the riskis a definite concern. In a woman with a familyhistory of breast cancer, this risk would be ofeven greater concern. There are many otheraspects of a woman's health (a history of liveror gall bladder disease, diabetes, uterinefibroids, blood clots, and so on) that must beconsidered by a doctor before any decision is made about HRT. In the end, all the pros and consof long-term replacement therapy will have to bevery carefully weighed. Because HRT of any kindcan interact with certain drugs, this must also beconsidered before initiating therapy. After careful diagnosis has eliminated any other possible causes of menstrual irregularities and othersymptoms, various approaches to hormone therapyare possible if the benefits are deemed to outweighthe risks. The use of oral contraceptives (birthcontrol pills) may re-establish normal periods inwomen of childbearing age in whom they have beenirregular or missing completely. Using birth controlpills can also help solve the problem of abnormallyheavy bleeding since they usually promote very Lark Lands, a medical journalist and longtime AIDS treatment educator and advocate, was a pioneer in bringing attention to the need for a total integrated approach to HIVdisease.

It can mean struggling with illness or drug side effects, grievingfor friends or family lost to the disease, and facing afuture where everything from jobs to relationships is more difficult than it was before you were diagnosed. Anyof these experiences is likely to fill you with intense sadnessat times \u2014 a natural, if painful, part of the coping process.But a recent survey showed that people with HIV and AIDS(PHAs) are particularly vulnerable to sorrow, anxiety orgrief turning into a prolonged, paralyzing depression (everyday for more than two weeks with no let-up) \u2014 a state inwhich your emotions can begin to damage your health. The survey of 136 HIV doctors, by the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care (IAPAC), foundthat 80 %of their patients with HIV suffer from depression or anxiety \u2014 more than 10 times higher than commonestimates of depression in the population at large.(Other studies have found that women are more likely toexperience depression than men, possibly because of theincreased stress they often face as caregivers.) And yet, in arelated IAPAC survey of 235 PHAs, only 62 %reported that their doctors ever asked them about their mental health.This data means two things: One, if you think depressioncan't happen to you, think again. And two, right whenyou're feeling the most down, you may have to be the oneto reach out for help. The problem I've found in my years as a psychotherapist is that while physical illness usually prompts people to seekprofessional help, people often view depression as self-imposed weakness \u2014 especially those raised to keep a stiffupper lip. I've often heard patients say, \"I just need to snapout of this and think positively\" or \"I have only myself toblame.\" Well, it's not so simple.Real depression is extremely complex. It involves changes in your mood that are so severe andprolonged that you really can't \"snap out of it\" onyour own. In the middle of a depression you canbecome so preoccupied with your own feelings thatyou lose the ability to see the world objectively. Y oucan feel completely worthless, hopeless and unable toask for help. Embarrassment, shame and guilt canoften make your low mood sink even lower. Y ou canendlessly replay \"old tapes,\" second-guessing all yourpast choices \u2014 for PHAs, this can mean beatingyourself up about the circumstances of your infectionor past risk behaviors. Depression is the opposite ofseeing the world through rose-coloured glasses;instead, everything looks gray. Even when friends orfamily are trying to help, their comments may seemcritical, painful or frightening. As result, you may pullfurther into your shell, shutting out the world. One Canadian psychotherapist (she asked not to be named, to protect the confidentiality of herpatients) who's been treating PHAs since 1987 saysthat depression among women with HIV has its ownparticular patterns. She sees more \"anxiousdepression\" rather than \"hopeless depression\" inwomen, who are often overwhelmed trying to copewith their own illness and the illness of a child. Thiscan mean more feelings of anxiety and guilt, oftenaccompanied by eating or sleeping too much. Manywomen, she says, struggle with \"a great deal ofenormous sadness over losses and how to cope withWhen grief, illness or plain-old hard times turn into a prolonged depression, your health and survival could be at stake.

Besides major diarrhea and hair loss, I had severe depression, so severe that I considered suicide. I feltisolated, like nobody cared. I was on that drug for three months.With the meds I take now, I also feel depressed sometimes,which leads to tiredness, when all I want to do is sleep all thetime. When I\u00d5m having a bad day, I don\u00d5t go anywhere, and thisis hard for my grandchildren to understand. They notice that Itake a lot of pills, and they know I do that to stay healthy.

Regardless of gender,many of her patients with HIV struggle with the image that the disease is now supposed to be \"chronic andcontrollable,\" but the reality of fatigue, side effects andfinancial pressures means \"you can't really go back to yourformer life.\" As well, there are stages in living with HIVwhen the likelihood of depression may be worse, includingafter initial diagnosis, after developing serious physicalillness, or after the death of friends and loved ones. If any of these stresses push you into a real depression, your health may suffer. Y ou may stop eating and sleepingwell or taking your HIV medicines on time or making it todoctors' appointments \u2014 all recipes for a health disaster.At worst, some people experiencing depression take theirown lives. So for your own health, and the well-being ofthe people closest to you, if you suspect you may be on the slippery slope to depression, talk with your doctor.He or she may be able to refer you to a psychotherapist. Diagnosis When you're in a depression, it can feel inescapable \u2014 but in fact there are a variety of ways to treat it. A holisticapproach might include such basic steps as regularizing yourroutine and getting more exercise, along with prescribedmedications, vitamins and supplements, counselling ortherapy and social support. But the first step is diagnosis \u2014and that can be somewhat complicated for PHAs. Risk factors Research has shown that some things can make peoplevulnerable to depression or make depression worse. Healthcare professionals call these \"risk factors.\" They include: ya history of depression before HIV diagnosis yalcohol or substance (ab)use yan anxiety disorder ya family history in which a mother, father or sibling has any of the above ya family history of suicide yinadequate social support The fact that PHAs may experience many stressful life events in a short period of time \u2014 related to social factorssuch as the difficulty of disclosing to others and the potentialfor rejection, the experience of stigma and discrimination asa result of HIV status, the loss of physical health and energy,and the deaths of friends and loved ones \u2014 can also increasethe likelihood of depression.Provided by Hazra, certified aromatherapist THE POSITIVE SIDE30Symptoms Psychotherapists and family physicians will typically look for the following symptoms in distinguishing betweenregular sorrow or worry and chronic depression: yA \u00d2down,\u00d3 very low or irritable mood, sometimes with outbursts of crying or anger triggered by minor incidents. yNot being able to take pleasure in activities of daily living. Things that used to make you smile or distract you no longer give you joy. yNot caring about anything. \u00d2What\u00d5s the point? I\u00d5m going to die anyway\u00d3 becomes your response to a new challenge. yAppetite loss, not attributable to a medical problem or drug side effect. yDifficulty falling or staying asleep, not attributable to a prescribed or recreational drug. yLoss of sex drive, not attributable to medication or HIV-related illness. yFatigue. Even getting out of bed or doing a tiny task has become difficult. yDifficulty concentrating or remembering things. Tasks that you could do before without much thought now require all your attention to complete. yDifficulty making even small decisions. You find yourself in the drugstore for a long time just trying to choose a new shampoo. yFeeling useless or worthless, a global feeling like \u00d2everything I do is wrong.\u00d3 ySocial withdrawal, removing yourself from family, friends or others whom you would normally see. yThoughts of killing yourself. Physical and other causes PHAs can suffer from a host of HIV-related medical problems that mimic or overlap with many of thesesymptoms of depression. So a crucial first step is to identify\u2014 and treat \u2014 any physical causes. Talk with your doctorabout getting tested for the following: yanemia (can cause fatigue) ysex hormone levels (hormone imbalances can diminish your sex drive) ythyroid levels (women have a higher incidence of hypothyroidism, a common, treatable glandular disorder which can cause depression) yHIV-related brain damage (can cause problems with memory and concentrati on) Overall, the same diagnoses that apply to men also apply to women, but women can additionally have uniquecauses of depression. Physicians treating women should becareful to identify any relationship between depression andthe following: ythe perinatal period period (after giving birth) ythe perimenopausal period (around menopause) Once you've taken steps to treat these physical problems, your doctor or therapist can better diagnose \u2014 and treat \u2014depression. Consider avoiding recreational drugs, alcohol and caffeine, which may disrupt your sleepcycle and cause fatigue. Encourage your doctor to look into whether any of the medications you're taking may be a factor, as afew can actually cause depression \u2014 or relatedsymptoms, such as difficulty concentrating \u2014 insome people. Some meds known to cause depressionor depression-like symptoms include: yefavirenz (Sustiva, antiretroviral) yinterferon (used treat hepatitis C) yacyclovir (Zovirax, used to treat herpes and shingles) yco-trimoxazole (used PCP prophylaxis) ysteroids (used to treat wasting) (Trecator) and isoniazid (both used to treat TB) ybirth control pills or hormone replacement therapy ymuscle relaxants like Baclofen T ell your doctor about all the meds you're taking, so he or she can assess their relevance whendiagnosing your depression. Testing At this point, your health care provider may chooseto use some standardized tests to help determinewhether you are clinically depressed. One reliabletool is a brief multiple-choice questionnaire calledthe \"Beck Depression Inventory.\" Try not to beintimidated by these tests. Answer honestly, and theresults can greatly help you and your caregiver planyour care and monitor your progress. Taking steps If you and your physician or psychotherapist cometo the conclusion that you are experiencingdepression, here are some simple tips that may helpyou start to feel better: yAccept the fact that you may be depressed. (You may already have while reading this article.) ySeek professional help. Sometimes well-meaning friends will try to talk you out of your depression, without fully understandingthe causes. yBreak the cycle of depression by developing small goals that you can gradually build on as you gain confidence and yourmood improves. Try to: yGo to bed and wake up at the same time each day. yWash your face, brush your teeth, comb your hair and get dressed each morning. yGet out of your home each day for a short walk or outing. yEngage in activities that you can stop or start easily, such as SPRING 2003 31light exercise or a shopping trip. (Exercise can release endorphins and adrenaline in your body that contribute to feelings of well-being, and a little retail therapy never hurts.) yChoose a few friends or family members who are the easiest to be around and have short but frequent contacts with them. yAvoid alcohol, recreational drugs and caffeine, as these have been shown to make depression worse in the long run. (A caution: If you\u00d5re already taking an antidepressant, even mild use of alcohol or recreational drugs can substantially reduce the medicine\u00d5s efficacy.) Counselling and therapy Meeting with a professional trained to treat depression can help in a variety of ways: yIt can help you explore the reasons why you became depressed as well as the best ways to cope with your depression. yIt can help you minimize risk factors that might make your depression worse. yIt can provide a \u00d2sounding board\u00d3 to help you regain feelings of control. There are many kinds of therapy, from HIV support groups to one-on-one meetings with a psychotherapist. Therapists usedifferent techniques to help you with your depression. Someuse an expressive approach that helps you identify and ventyour feelings. Others use an insight-oriented approach thathelps you look at patterns of relationships over your lifehistory and how they affect you today. Others focus more onproblem-solving or behaviour change. Cognitive/behavioural therapy (CBT) has the strongest data showing a benefit in decreasing symptoms of depressionamong PHAs. CBT is based on the premise that you largelyfeel the way that you think, so it's useful to become aware of underlying thought processes that may be making yourdepression worse. CBT helps you identify these thoughts andthe situations that trigger them, so you and your therapist canthen develop more reassuring thought patterns. This, in turn,will contribute to positive lifestyle changes. CBT does not tryto turn you into a positive-thinking Pollyanna! Rather, it helpsyou acknowledge the legitimacy of the health threats andemotional struggles that you face, while allowing you to putthem in context. T o find a psychotherapist, you can ask your family physician for a referral. Y ou could also ask your HIV clinic or local AIDS organization whether they keep referral lists.Keep in mind that of the professions that typically do psycho-therapy (psychiatry, psychology and social work), onlypsychiatrists may prescribe antidepressant medications.Ultimately, the most important thing is to choose a therapistwhom you feel comfortable with and \"click\" with \u2014 if you feelyou can only open up to a woman, trust your instincts. Makesure you pick someone who is willing to answer any of yourquestions without rushing you or being defensive.Remember: If you're feeling suicidal, call your local crisis help-line or go immediately to the nearestemergency \u2014 don't wait for a therapy appointment! Antidepressants Both the rate of depression and the severity of sideeffects of antidepressants may increase with theseverity of HIV disease, but people may benefit fromthese drugs at any stage of disease. In certaincircumstances, PHAs may be more sensitive to theeffects of antidepressants and may therefore requirelower dosing. Women may also require relativelylower doses of antidepressants than a man would,because of their relatively smaller body sizes,which may cause them to achieve higher levels ofantidepressants in their blood. This particularlyapplies to women who may be underweight byvirtue of their HIV disease. It should be noted thatthe potential effects of antidepressants on a fetusneed to be considered when treating pregnantwomen, but there are some antidepressants that areconsidered safe for pregnant women. The first-line antidepressants for PHAs \u2014 and the most commonly prescribed \u2014 are knownas \"selective serotonin uptake inhibitors\" serotonin, a neurotransmitter(signal-carrying chemical) that helps your bodyregulate mood \u2014 resulting in greater feelings ofcalm, well-being and happiness. Many PHAs swearby their SSRIs, cautions: Some SSRIs causeside effects, including gastrointestinal upset anddecreased sex drive, and some interact with HIVmeds (for instance, the protease inhibitor ritonavir,or Norvir, increases the level of SSRIs in the blood).Check with your doctor or pharmacist aboutpossible drug interactions. Some antidepressants,like Celexa, interact least with anti-HIV meds. A Elavil, Pamelor, T ofraniland Sinequan), are also used to treat chronic pain.A third category is known as MAO inhibitors.These are not commonly prescribed due to the largenumber of drug interactions and dietary restrictions.Other antidepressants with Effexor, Wellbutrin and Buproprion. Sometimes you may have to try more than one antidepressant before you find the right fit, so don'tbe discouraged. Antidepressants are non-addictive various community-basedorganizations. Toronto, Ontario Idon\u00d5t find having HIV inspiring at all. I find it totally depressing. Some people say it\u00d5s the most empowering thing that ever happened to them. Well, not for me. It\u00d5s a major dragthat I try to cope with. I often feel like I\u00d5m being punished. So, I try not to dwell on HIV. I enjoy things that have to do with relaxation and being in the moment. And human kindness. Whenit comes to just dealing with unpleasant things in the world,human kindness seems to always emerge. A number of things help me cope. One is engaging in life. Another is the belief that there\u00d5s some strong universal energythat\u00d5s very powerful, that has its own momentum. That\u00d5s acomforting thought \u00d1 that one\u00d5s personal miseries or difficultiesare not really that big a deal in the grand scheme of things. - POST-PARTUM DEPRESSION Post-partum depression (PPD) \u00d1 depression after giving birth \u00d1 does not present in the same way in every woman. Studies haveshown that up to 80% of women experience a mild form of depressionshortly after their baby is born, but a smaller percentage canexperience more severe symptoms, which include: yuncontrollable crying or persistent sadness yfeelings of anxiety or panic attacks yrestlessness and inability to sleep, despite exhaustion yappetite loss yirritability, moodiness ya lack of interest in your child ydifficulty concentrating It is quite common to feel extremely guilty if you are suffering from PPD, because everyone, including your husband or partner, is probablytelling you that this should be a happy time. You can end up feelinglike a bad mother for having some of these symptoms, but recognizethat this is part of the illness. Don\u00d5t self-diagnose or keep your feelingsa secret because it may get much worse. Seek professional help; agood start is to talk with a trusted family doctor. The exact cause of PPD is unknown, although some of the risk factors are similar to those already discussed in this article. Certainly, theissues associated with deciding whether to take antiretroviral therapyduring pregnancy and the fears around your baby having HIV couldcontribute to PPD. Also, because so many HIV+ mothers are singleparents or facing the prospects of single parenthood through death orabandonment, it is understandable how the new responsibilities thatcome with parenthood could be overwhelming. Because PPD can be so serious, it is very important if you are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy to take preventive steps to ensure youhave a good support network in place. Research shows that socialsupport both from personal and professional sources can buffer youagainst many stresses that might otherwise result in depression. WARNINGS: St. John\u00d5s wort used to be very popular with PHAs for treating depression. But it is now known that this herb interacts with many HIV meds \u00d1affecting the blood levels of several protease inhibitors and non-nukes as well asheart medicines \u00d1 and therefore should be used with extreme caution and onlyafter consultation with a licensed physician. Kavais also often taken for antidepressant and sedative effects. But this herb has been shown to cause severeliver toxicity. Health Canada recommends that it not be used. unlike tranquilizers, such as Valium, which are highly addictive \u2014 and can be safely used for long periods of time. Manyantidepressants decrease anxiety as well as depression,particularly important for many women with HIV . That IAPACsurvey found that HIV doctors are more likely to prescribeantidepressants than any other intervention for depression, butkeep this in mind: Research has shown that antidepressants are most effective when combined with psychotherapy. If you're considering taking an antidepressant, make sure that your doctor knows about your HIV status, as well as anymedications, supplements or herbal products that you'retaking. This is because mixing some supplements, such asherbs, with antidepressants can cause dangerous side effects.If possible, see a specialist who knows how to best co-manageHIV disease and depression. - David Coop, a trained psychotherapist with 14 years of experience in the HIV field, is the director of treatment information at CATIE.

Because her mother, Anne, is HIV+, Kristina had to takethree HIV tests after she was born to make sure she didn't get thevirus from her mom. The first two came back negative, but thethird, administered at 18 months, was the defining result. Likethe other tests, this one came back negative, proving the goodnews: Kristina was positively, no question, HIV negative. It was a grueling 18 months for Anne. \"I felt so guilty until the [third] test came back. I couldn't live with the thought of Kristinahaving what I have, because her life is so innocent.\" Anne'spregnancy was also a stressful journey. She found out she hadHIV during a routine prenatal checkup and her doctorimmediately booked an abortion. But Anne and her husband hadother ideas. They wanted their baby and found an HIV specialistwho gave them hope, along with a prescription for the anti-retroviral that would prevent transmission of the virus. Kristina was born in 1996, just before the advent of HAART and the status of HIV as a potentially manageable chronic disease wheregood quality of life is not only possible but a right, at least in acountry like Canada. Back then, the medical community, societyand even HIV+ women themselves felt that they should not havebabies. \"There was a stigma,\" says Susan King, MD, co-director ofthe HIV/AIDS program at T oronto's Hospital for Sick Children. We sure have come a long way, baby. According to Health Canada, the number of babies born to HIV+ moms increasedfrom 56 in 1991 to 138 in 2001, and since 1996, the number ofbabies born with HIV has decreased. King says she now has HIV+patients who are having second, even third babies. That's becausetoday, with proper treatment, mother-to-child transmission can almost always be prevented. A great example: At Montreal'sSainte-Justine Hospital, the centre for mothers and children with AIDS boasts a transmission rate of zero.In spite of these strides, deciding to have a baby is still a decision fraught with emotional, physicaland social concerns. That's why King helpedimplement a counselling program at T oronto'sMotherisk Clinic for HIV Treatment in Pregnancyas part of every positive mom-to-be's treatmentstrategy: \"It's such a specialized area and we werefinding that women weren't getting the most up-to-date information. We decided to create a placewhere they could come see what choices wereavailable, have help looking at their options andeventually make the decision that's right for them.\" Yvonne [not her real name], who didn't learn she was HIV+ until after the birth of her first baby,feels truly blessed that the child is negative. Butbefore she and her husband (who also has HIV)decided to have their second child, she needed toknow she had family support. She explained to hermother and siblings what could happen if she orthe children got sick. \"I needed my family'sapproval,\" Yvonne says. \"If anything happened tome or my husband, I wanted to know they were upfor the challenge and knew what they were in for.\"Yvonne just gave birth to her fourth HIV negativechild. \"I spend a lot of time with the kids,\" she says.\"I'm lucky.\" Both Anne and Yvonne will tell you that the day- to-day joys of motherhood help them cope with theanxieties of living with a chronic disease. \"I lovebeing a mom,\" Anne says. \"It gives me a reason tolive. Kristina makes my day. We call her Angel Bugand we feel like she's a gift from God.\" MORE HIV+ WOMEN are realizing their dreams of becoming moms. With proper treatment and care, there\u00d5slittle reason baby shouldn\u00d5t make three (or four\u00c9). THE POSITIVE SIDE34So you want to have a baby Here are some things you should know: MTC TRANSMISSION Mother-to-child transmission of HIV , also called perinatal or vertical transmission, can happen in 3 ways: yHIV can pass to the fetus while in the womb through mom\u00d5s blood supply. This is uncommon and usually only happens when mom\u00d5s viral load is high. yDuring labour and delivery, the baby can be infected by coming in close contact with mom\u00d5s blood and bodily fluids in the birth canal. If mom\u00d5s viral load isundetectable, her chances of transmitting the virus this way are greatly reduced. yBreast milk carries HIV, so breast-feeding is a high-risk way to transmit the virus. Strategies to protect mom and baby There are two very important components of treatment when a woman is pregnant. First and foremost, the health of the mothermust be protected. Second, consideration should be given topreventing HIV transmission from the mother to the baby, andotherwise supporting the health of the baby. Alas, in focusing on the latter, the former is sometimes under-stressed. DeborahMoney, MD, FRCSC, assistant professor and head of the Divisionof Maternal Fetal Medicine at the University of British Columbia,says, \"We absolutely must focus primarily on the mother's health.The worst thing for a fetus is a critically ill mum.\" In terms of HIV , the first thing to consider is whether the woman needs HAART for her own health. If she's already on aneffective combination, she should stick with it. If she isn't onmeds but the standard treatment guidelines indicate that sheshould be, then \"they should be started immediately, even if it'searly in the pregnancy,\" Dr. Money says. \"The only caveat is thatyou pick the least toxic drugs. And, of course, avoid any drugs thatmight cause birth defects, including delavirdine (Rescriptor) andefavirenz (Sustiva).\" She most commonly recommends a regimencontaining the nukes AZT (it's tried and true and has been usedfor years in pregnant women with few problems) and 3TC(another long-used, non-problematic drug), inhibitornelfinavir (Viracept). Standard treatment guidelines recommend doing genotyping (a blood test to look for drug resistance) with all pregnantwomen. However, in the treatment-naive (those who've neverbeen on HAART), Dr. Money and her colleagues tend to beginHAART without the test as a cost-saving measure, while storingthe woman's blood to preserve the possibility of later testing ifa failure to achieve a low viral load indicates the likelihood ofdrug resistance. In women who have previously taken HAART ,genotyping is done before re-starting meds to increase thechances for picking an effective combination. The mother should also be given any other therapies that are important to her health. For those with a CD4 count below 200,this would include prophylactic drugs to prevent opportunisticinfections. \"Don't avoid drugs because of fears,\" Dr. Money says.\"Y ou must protect mom first.\"For expectant mothers whose viral loads and CD4 counts would not otherwise indicate a need for antiretrovirals (according to standard treatmentguidelines), reducing the risk of MTC transmissionis the key concern. Experts recommend that allpregnant HIV+ women begin HAART between 14and 18 weeks into the pregnancy. \"At that point, westart the woman on HAART and suppress her viralload to undetectable throughout the rest of thepregnancy, if possible,\" Dr. Money says. There are two main reasons for this. First, although relatively rare overall, the possibility of HIVtransmission in the womb goes up in synch with themother's viral load. Second, there is always thepossibility of a premature delivery. \"In many HIV+women, there are factors that increase the risk forpre-term delivery, including injection-drug or cocaineuse, lack of access to care, and increased rates ofsexually transmitted diseases,\" Dr. Money says. \"So it'simportant to keep the viral load as low as possiblethrough the last months of pregnancy to help preventtransmission during delivery.\" Even in women withundetectable viral loads, HAART has been shown tofurther reduce the risk of MTC transmission. Blood tests to look for problems should be performed two weeks after starting antiretrovirals andthen every month throughout the pregnancy. Also, it'svery important that fetal growth and well-being beevaluated every four to six weeks until delivery. When active labour begins (there is cervical dilation and/or contractions) or any time there is aruptured membrane, doctors recommend that themother continue taking her meds on schedule to the greatest extent possible (although nausea mayprevent this). In addition, an AZT drip (intravenous)should be done throughout labour and delivery(with oral AZT discontinued). This helps preventtransmission by pre-loading the baby with AZT.For reasons that are unclear, this seems to work evenwhen genotypic testing has shown that the mom isresistant to AZT, so the drip is recommended for all.After delivery, the AZT drip is stopped, and if themom was only taking meds for the baby's sake, herHAART is stopped immediately. If she needs themeds for her own health, they're continued. Thebaby is given AZT syrup for the first six weeks of life. In women who haven't taken HAART prior to going into labour, it's recommended that they begiven a single dose of nevirapine (200 mg) as soonas possible after going into labour, that an AZT dripbe given throughout labour, and that the baby begiven a single dose of nevirapine immediately afterbirth, followed by six weeks of AZT syrup.Clinicians used to believe that Cesarean section was the best way to reduce a newborn's exposure to mom's blood and bodilyfluids. But a C-section is major surgery with multiple inherentrisks, and experts now believe that if the mother's viral load isfully suppressed, there is no benefit to be gained from it. In awoman who has not been on HAART or whose viral load is notfully suppressed, a C-section can be considered at 38 weeks. Last, but not least, just say no to breast-feeding. \"It's quite clear the virus is in breast milk and even if mom has a low viralload, we suggest formula feeding,\" Dr. King explains. \"It's safeand has nutritional benefits.\" Will HIV drugs hurt your baby? Most HIV doctors, like Anita Rachlis, MD, medical director ofthe Ambulatory HIV Clinic at Sunnybrook and Women's CollegeHealth Sciences Centre in T oronto, agree that combinationtherapy is a must for HIV+ pregnant women but say that there are definite caveats. \"Women considering pregnancy must discuss this with their treating physicians because certaindrugs have the potential to cause malformations in thedeveloping embryo.\" For moms-to-be, the prospect of their children experiencing adverse reactions from HIV meds is a common fear. BecauseHAART has only been around since 1996, we don't really knowits long-term effects. A French study of more than 4,000 womenreported increased seizure disorders in infants exposed to HIVmeds, but the seizures weren't life-threatening and affected only30 babies. Additionally, researchers have speculated that HAARTmight negatively affect cellular energy, possibly harming organslike the brain and liver, but to date, research has not shown this. Research coordinator Johanne Samson, from Ste-JustineHospital, says, \"We're still concerned about the long-term effects and more research needs to be done.\" Luckily, in December of 2001, the United States' Antiretro- viral Pregnancy Registry released a study of 2,800 pregnanciesthat found that taking HIV meds during the first trimester didnot increase the incidence of birth defects. For many womenand clinicians, these results helped alleviate fears. Dr. Money sums up the bottom line by saying: \"Despite any remaining concerns, it should never be forgotten that the onething we absolutely do know is that taking antiretrovirals verygreatly reduces the risk of having an HIV+ baby, with all thelifetime risks and problems that creates. Any concerns aboutpossible drug side effects must be put in that perspective.\" Caring for the whole woman In addition to anything related to HIV , it should never beforgotten that mom-to-be needs all the things that any pregnantwoman needs: good nutrition, supplementation with a prenatalvitamin/mineral formula, good prenatal care that includes beingchecked for diabetes and other possible complications, and so on.\"There are a million and one standard pregnancy issues that needStacie Stukin is a Los Angeles-based magazine writer and a regular contributor to POZmagazine (www.poz.com) and Yoga Journal (www.yogajournal.com).

The clinic\u00d5s Women and Family HIV Centre hasclinical guidelines for the treatment of HIV+ women during labour anddelivery and for the treatment of infants born to HIV+ women.to be taken care of,\" Dr. Money says. \"Physicians should not get so focused on the HIV that they forgetthis is a pregnant woman with all the usual needs thatare related to pregnancy in any woman.\" For women not yet pregnant but planning to be, folic acid should be taken to prevent neural tubedefects. During pregnancy, excellent nutrition iscrucial for both mom and growing baby. In the 2 nd and 3rdtrimesters, it's important to add 300 calories and 15 extra grams of protein each day. Asking for areferral to a dietitian who can make recommendationson these and other dietary changes is an excellent ideafor all moms-to-be. It is well known that the health ofa newborn is influenced by the nutritional health ofthe mother throughout pregnancy. Even without pregnancy, HIV infection is known to cause many nutrient deficiencies while increasing theneed for calories, so it's even more important tooptimize nutrient intake through both diet and prenatalsupplements. The latter are higher in folic acid and ironand lower in vitamin A (which can cause birth defectsin too-high doses).

Check with your doctor,pharmacist and/or naturopathic physician. - A mother Diagnosed with HIV: 2000; CD4 count: 450; Viral load: 3,000. Montreal (Quebec) It\u00d5s very important to have good health care, regular follow-ups and a good doctor you can talk to. A good, well-informed doctor is essential so you don\u00d5t end up with misconceptions. Your doctor has to put you at ease and you must have good information. I was pregnant with my second child when I was diagnosed with HIV. It was a shock, but I never thought my child would be infected because Itook my meds and was told that if I followed the instructions carefully,my child would be OK. I never had any doubts about my child. Mypregnancy wasn\u00d5t any different from the first one. I had a C-section. Iwanted to be sure that my doctor would be delivering the baby. I didn\u00d5twant to have to deal with another doctor and have to tell my story.There was no problem. I want to tell women with HIV not to give up when it comes to getting pregnant. The only problem is the treatment for the newborn. It wasthe most difficult time, six weeks of treatment with very frequentdoctors\u00d5 appointments. But besides that, everything is normal. Wehave to tell women to go forward, there\u00d5s no reason not to. - SPRING 2003 35THE POSITIVE SIDE36EXCERPTS FROM THE LIFE OF AN HIV+ MOTHER We all know that living with HIV is achallenge. Throw in motherhood, and life becomes a roller coaster. For the past decade, I've experienced the upsand downs of positive motherhood, from diapers todisclosure. Throughout this time, I've found support frommany wonderful women, some who are no longer with usand others who continue to be my pillars of strength. All ofthese women have children and all of these women havestories. Mine is only one of them A pregnant pause When I found out I was pregnant in 1992, HIV was thefurthest thing from my mind. I was about to become a mom\u2014 in my case, a single suburban mom with a great career andsupportive family. What was on my mind was preparing forthe baby \u2014 making sure I had an appropriate place for us tolive, stocking up on diapers and reading about \"what to expectwhen you're expecting.\" At nine months, I decided to upgrademy life insurance policy. The insurance company sent a nurseto my home to take blood and urine samples. When I askedwhat they were testing me for, she said, \"I don't know, but theytest for AIDS.\" With that, she slapped an AIDS brochure on thecoffee table and asked me to sign a consent form. Later that month my son was born. The test never crossed my mind again until February 1993, when my mom and I werewatching an AIDS documentary on TV . I said to my mom, \"Ihaven't heard from the insurance company and they've cashedmy deposit cheque, so I guess I don't have AIDS.\" March 13, 1993. I picked up the mail and there was a letter from the insurance company. It explained that, due to healthreasons, they couldn't accept my application for lifeinsurance. I was directed to contact my doctor in 10 days tofind out why. I knew the news must have been bad, but notknowing exactly what it was, I called the insurance companyand asked for my test information. Of course, they wouldn'tgive it to me. I asked them to fax it to my doctor's office andthey finally agreed. When I spoke, by telephone, to the nursein the office, she told me she'd received the fax and that Icouldn't get insurance because I have HIV .I had many emotions to deal with. I felt very guilty that my family would have to go throughthis. I felt confused and powerless. It was asthough I'd lost complete control of my life. I wasafraid: Afraid of what would happen to us. Afraidof what people would think. Afraid of notifyingmy previous partners. I was curious about how Iwas infected. I wondered if I would die. And I wasangry. Angry with the doctor who had once toldme that I wasn't in a high-risk group. And justplain angry. These are many of the same emotions that other women have upon diagnosis. But I reallycouldn't take the time to deal with theseemotions. I had to concentrate on the baby \u2014who was now 3 1/2months old \u2014 and reduce his risk of transmission and get him diagnosed. First, there was the process of switching him to a bottle, because I'd been nursing him. On theday of my diagnosis, I learned that HIV could betransmitted through breast milk, so I stoppednursing immediately. The next step was to gethim diagnosed. At the HIV Clinic of the T orontoHospital for Sick Children, I met with a highlyskilled staff of doctors and nurses, dentists,psychologists and social workers. It washeartbreaking for me to see my tiny baby pokedand prodded for blood. Two months later, my son was diagnosed with HIV . When the doctor told me the news, I didn'task too many questions. I didn't know what toask. I think I was in shock.SPRING 2003 37Mother\u00d5s little helpers MAY 1993 - Today was the worst day of my life. I found out the baby has it, too. I was sosure he wouldn\u00d5t. I was so sure it couldn\u00d5t getany worse. As soon as the doctor came in theroom, I knew. He didn\u00d5t even have to say a word.I couldn\u00d5t help it, I started to cry. The babylaughed. It was almost as if he were saying,\u00d2Don\u00d5t worry, mom.\u00d3 The first few months after our diagnosis, the stress was over- whelming. I bordered on a nervous breakdown and left workon disability. I spent most of my time fussing over the babyand attending doctors' appointments for one or the other ofus. During this time, a concerned family member brought mesome resources about HIV . I started to research the disease Iwas facing. I realized that if we were going to survive I'd betterpick myself up and find out as much about this virus as Ipossibly could. I contacted my local health department, whichreferred me to Voices of Positive Women. I attended my firstsupport group about four months after my diagnosis. Icouldn't believe the number of women there. Much of whatthey talked about went over my head and mostly I just sat therequietly and cried. Later that summer, I attended the first camp for HIV+ moms and their kids, sponsored by Sick Kids Hospital. Wemoms met several times to discuss issues that we felt wereimportant to us as parents. We all found the experience to bevery rewarding and decided that we'd try to continue ournewly found support group in some form. In the fall of 1993,the first support group for moms met in my grandmother'sliving room! Some women travelled up to 100 km to attend.With the assistance of Voices and The T eresa Group, oursupport group met once a month. We discussed such issues aswho will care for our children if we get sick or die and how totalk to our kids about HIV . Facilitating the moms' support group was very therapeutic for me. It allowed me to get support while volunteering mytime and it made me feel like I was part of the solution. WhileI'm no longer involved as an active member of the moms'support group, it continues to thrive as a vibrant part ofVoices' programming. In fact, similar programs are nowavailable in other communities. Volunteerism and activismhave become a very important part of my personal supportand resource system.Mum\u00d5s the word NOVEMBER 1998 - There are days, most days, when it\u00d5s like he doesn\u00d5teven have it. He gets on the bus inthe morning with all the otherchildren, plays soccer before the belland takes his seat with the rest ofthe class. At lunch he eats hissandwich and treat but leaves theapple for later. He goes to gym class,computer club and baseball practice -all the things that \u00d2normal\u00d3 kids do.So, then, why isn\u00d5t he treatednormally? Why does he have to hide?Why do there have to be secrets? Ithought it was OK to tell. I neverthought people would stilldiscriminate, especially not with achild. But I was wrong. I was sowrong. And, believe me, that\u00d5s hardfor me to admit. Disclosure is a very difficult and personal issue. I chose to disclose to my son naturally over time. Asa positive child, he was used to taking medicine andseeing me take it. He was also used to going to thedoctor's office. At about age 5, he began to askquestions like: \"Why do I have to take medicine andmy cousin doesn't?\" and \"Why do I have to get anIV and other kids don't?\" I answered him in partialtruths. At first, I told him he had special blood.Then, that he had a virus. He asked how he got it.That's when I told him he got it from me.Eventually he wanted to know the name of hisvirus. He now takes an active part in his own healthcare by sorting his medications and discussingsymptoms and test results with his doctors. While disclosing to kids is tough, asking them to keep a secret is tougher. There are times when Idoubt my decision to tell him. It was heartbreakingto explain to my son that a lot of people don't knowyou can't get HIV from being friends and that theymay be afraid to play with him. Positive moms, whether or not their kids have HIV , often face stigma and fear discrimination forTHE POSITIVE SIDE38 themselves and their children while participating in regular family activities. Most parents don't tell schools and recreational clubsthat they have HIV for fear of alienation. One school didn't wantme to drive in a carpool because the principal was afraid I'd havean accident and bleed on the children. Clearly, this wasdiscrimination, and I was furious. Unfortunately, it took a callfrom a lawyer for her to see the error of her ways. She laternotified me that I was allowed to drive other students in myvehicle. However, this incident strained our relationship and madeit uncomfortable for me to communicate with her about my son'sprogress in school. I didn't enroll him there the next year. Another public school decided they'd begin using latex gloves to serve pizza on the day I was scheduled to volunteer for thattask. As soon as the new rule was announced, I knew why andmy heart sank. I could feel the tears well up in my eyes.Afterwards, I confronted the principal, who said that the healthdepartment had recommended the gloves and that it hadnothing to do with me. I asked her if it was just a coincidencethat they started doing it the day I was scheduled to volunteer.She didn't say a word. Again, the relationship became strainedand uncomfortable. Several other discriminatory scenes tookplace at this school. Eventually I filed a human rights case againstthem, but it was unsuccessful. I felt it was necessary to changeschool districts and do what most parents do: not disclose. Moms of HIV+ kids have added decisions around disclosure. Should I tell the babysitter, school or boy scouts? What aboutsports coaches? How do you handle medications for a sleepover?At first, I was afraid to leave my son with anyone who didn'tknow he has HIV , so most of the time I'd leave him only withfamily. I've since taught my son to keep his body fluids tohimself and not to touch anyone else's. He only goes onsleepovers to friends and family who know he needs medication.As for schools, sports and scouts, sure, sometimes I'd like to tell,but I've realized that, for the most part, people really don't needto know and that, even in 2003, they often react poorly. Mother knows best JUNE 2000 - I really didn\u00d5t feel like walking him to school today. Not that I didn\u00d5t want to, I just didn\u00d5t feel like it. Mothers with HIV , like most moms, tend to put their own needs second to the needs of their children. The kids need tobe fed, the kids don't have clean clothes, the kids haveswimming lessons, and so on. In addition, meeting withvarious doctors around the city about the health of one's HIV+child leaves little time and energy for positive moms to do thesame for themselves.Sometimes I just don't feel well. For me, one of the hardest things about being an HIV+ mom isgoing on with your day and trying to act like allis OK when you really feel like you've been runover by a truck. There are days I don't want tomake breakfast or lunch and walk to school.Although my son knows I have HIV , I don't wanthim to see me sick. I don't always hide how I feel,just enough so he doesn't worry too much. When I decided to start HAART in the fall of 1996, I wasn't prepared for potential side effects. Iexperienced nausea and vomiting for severalmonths, followed by kidney complications. Witha 4 year old at home, I was run ragged. I seriouslyconsidered stopping the meds for a while so Icould cook, clean and care for my son. EventuallyI was able to get some help at home to get methrough the roughest times. Like all HIV+ women, I wrestle with treatment decisions for myself. In addition, I must considerchoices for my son. One of the most difficultdecisions I ever made was to give my child amedication that had previously sent me to thehospital with an adverse reaction. Such choicesare further complicated by the small amount ofresearch data available on which to base informedtreatment decisions for women and children. I've only begun to touch on the issues that HIV+ moms and their families face. Family lifewith HIV is a different experience for everyone.Various factors, including culture, relationships,geography and finances, compound our problemsand affect our choices about disclosure, support,treatment and the future \u2014 choices not only forourselves but also for our children. As a positivemom, I've faced a myriad of daily challenges, butthey're very often rewarded with a simple\"Thanks mom, you're the best!\"...and that makesthe struggle more than worthwhile. - Shari Margolese has been an active voice for women and HIV for 10 years.

Peer mentor at Voices of Positive Women.Education outreach worker at Algoma AIDS Network. Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario There\u00d5s a need to ensure that women\u00d5s voices are heard. We need to address some barriers, such asaccess to childcare. In order for people to participate and be active, their needs have to be taken care of. Caregiving is a big issue for women. There seems to be a lack of support in communities for families dealing with HIV. My children are very important to me, but being a mother of four is verytiresome. At the end of the day, I go home from work and do thegroceries, cleaning, kids\u00d5 homework. It\u00d5s a never ending situation. Eventhough my partner helps me, he\u00d5s limited in what he can physically do. It\u00d5s very difficult for children to know what situation their parents arefacing. My oldest daughter, 16, helps me out a lot. She feels a lot ofpressure. This may be one reason why our kids put themselves at riskmore \u00d1 the stress and feeling that they have to fill the parental role. Sothey look for the release mechanism with sex, drugs and alcohol. Quiteoften my daughter puts herself in risky positions. It\u00d5s hard to sit backand see her do that. I try to make myself open to her so she can talkabout anything, and she feels very comfortable discussing things withme. Initiating safer sex/alcohol/drug conversations can be a huge issue,but leaving it for the heat of the moment only makes it more difficult. There\u00d5s no support for children like my daughter. My kids don\u00d5t get to enjoy the benefits of ballet orsports because of the high expenses associated with these activities. Finding economical things forthem to do is difficult. They\u00d5ve fought with depression quite a bit. When I\u00d5m ill, for them it all comesback to the question: \u00d2What\u00d5s going to happen to us?\u00d3 There\u00d5s no program to address their concerns,no mechanisms or plans built in for future care of the kids. Right now there are no options for mychildren, there are no family members who could fill that parental role. - Rhonda Stevens, 32 Diagnosed with HIV: 1994; CD4 count: around 300; Viral load:undetectable.

My family is in the Caribbean and the U.S.; I wish they were around. It\u00d5s very hard at times, especiallynow, because my 12-year-old daughter is having some teenageproblems. She\u00d5s also HIV+. My other kids know that my eldestgirl and I both have HIV. I\u00d5ve always been really open and honestwith them. I had a girlfriend, she\u00d5s still living with me but we\u00d5renot getting along, and I think that\u00d5s contributing to my daughter\u00d5sactions right now. - CD4 load: around 50. Volunteer at various AIDSorganizations, including Voices of Positive Women, Kingston AIDS Project and Street Health. Artist.Kingston, Ontario Being a mother means a lot to me. I thought I\u00d5d never have children. Before I tested positive, I went fora fertility test. After my doctor learned that I used drugs and was involved in sex work, she suggested an HIV test. I\u00d5d just moved from Montreal and didn\u00d5t speak English well, so when I came to pick up theresult she told me I was positive and I thought it was good and asked her when I should make anotherappointment. Then she took out a box of Kleenex and said: \u00d2You don\u00d5t understand. You have AIDS.\u00d3 I gaveup my dreams of having children. Now I\u00d5m the mother of a healthy 3-year-old boy! He helps me stay happy. I get us involved in differenteducational programs and sports activities. I look around the community and see what\u00d5s out there.When you volunteer for an organization, they usually give you some incentives, which makes life a biteasier. It\u00d5s nice because you\u00d5re not always stuck at home. When your child is first born, it\u00d5s great! Butafter a year and a half, I wanted to get out of the house. Now I make sure my son has differentopportunities to meet and play with other kids. And I get to meet other adults. The organizations Ivolunteer at usually provide childcare and help me have time for myself. That really helps. So, whenthere\u00d5s an agency that interests you, call and ask how you can get involved. - SPRING 2003 39 Photos: Jake Peters Robyn, children, 9 and 12, and they know aboutmy status.

My son is now coming to deal with thestress about his own mortality, and his father\u00d5s andmine, and he\u00d5s afraid but we\u00d5re dealing with it. Bothmy kids are healthy and great. I used volunteer a lot, and from time to time I stilldo. When I started, my son was just a baby andthere was no childcare at the AIDS committee, so Ihad to take him with me and he\u00d5d sleep in theplaypen. I\u00d5ve done public speaking, but I kind ofburned out, and I needed to take more time formyself. The kids aren\u00d5t old enough yet to stay athome alone, and I don\u00d5t mind doing something nowand again, but I want to spend my time with them.They\u00d5re the focus of my life, even though theysometimes drive me nuts. As a single mom, to get rid of the stresses of theday, I listen to relaxation tapes, take walks with mykids, play darts \u00d1 that\u00d5s a stress reliever! When youhave kids, you try to gear everything toward them. Ialso take long baths and listen to sounds of nature.I try to maintain a positive attitude and be anoptimist. I guess your mind has to be in some stateof denial in order to cope. On my good days, I makethe most of it; on my not-so-good days, I tend to bea hypochondriac. But I really try to not let things getme down and to take every day as it comes. Lifeisn\u00d5t bad; it\u00d5s only what you make of it. -THE POSITIVE SIDE40NOVEMBER 2002 MARKED EIGHT YEARS OF A HEROIN-FREE LIFE. I travelled a long road to stop taking the drug that was destroying my health and making me unhappy. I've been living with HIV andhepatitis C since 1992. My name is Chantale Perron andI'm 36 years old. It took me two years to get over my diagnosis. I thought my life was over, with no hope of ever having aboyfriend, job or children. But, eventually, I started towork on myself, improving my self-esteem andaffirmation skills (I learned to say no instead of yes all thetime, I started to speak my real thoughts and defend myopinion). I'd always been very weak, especially when itcame to men. I tried to please them all the time, because I thought that no man would want to be with a girl likeme (even before HIV , so imagine how I felt after!). Those days are behind me now. I have a boyfriend of six years and we are very much in love. He was also aninjection drug user (IDU). And he has HIV , too, so wehave that in common...and much more. For the past few years, I've worked at CPA VIH (Comit\u00e9 des Personnes Atteintes du VIH du Qu\u00e9bec), mostlyproviding information about the medical aspects of HIV .Because of my personal experience with drugs and HIV ,I'm often invited to conferences and to sit on committeesas a representative of drug users and PHAs, to make surethat good decisions are made regarding the real needs ofthese people. I like to be able to help people who usedrugs. Maybe it's because I know too well all the obstaclesthat they have to go through, all the judgments andmisconceptions they have to fight. What keeps me going? Defending a cause and feeling useful. That's why I've devoted my life to ensuring thatthe harm reduction approach is adopted, in order toimprove the lives of drug users in Canada. In 2001, Icreated Pusher d'Infos , a journal written primarily by and for current and former users, in order to give avoice to drug users and provide a space where theycan express themselves and defend their rights. Thejournal provides information to educate users sothey don't get HIV and hepatitis, as well asinformation that helps those with HIV and hepatitisfeel better. Drug users are involved in the projectevery step of the way and they get paid like everyoneelse. Pusher d'Infos has been extremely popular and well-received in Quebec (99 %of content is in French with an occasional article or poem inEnglish). We have many more ideas, just watch us! WHAT IS HARM REDUCTION? The \"official\" definition of harm reduction isdescribed as \"a pragmatic approach that focuseson reducing the harmful consequences of drug use rather than on its elimination.\" In other words,since the war on drugs and its many sanctions clearlydo not prevent people from using illegal drugs, whynot give users the means to protect their health as wellas that of others? With this approach, the needs of theperson (ie. the drug user) are taken care of first. That's what I like about it. Forget about the typical drug-user profile and the infallible methodthat will help all users abstain \u2014 they don't exist.However, by treating drug users as human beingsand attempting to meet their needs and offer themoptions, we can obtain concrete results, such asreducing the spread of HIV and hepatitis C as wellas helping users who have these diseases to livelonger, healthy lives.Drug users are CITIZENS like any other! SPRING 2003 41HARM REDUCTION CAN CHANGE THE WORLD Harm reduction can take many forms. Needle exchanges are great, but harm reduction has to go further than that. More choices and tools should be made available so each user can find the method that suits him or her best. Wealso need services or approaches that fit better with women'srealities. I've noticed that in therapy centres there are more men than women; the same is true at CPA VIH and with Pusher d'Infos . For some reason, it's more difficult to reach women. But women using drugs and/or who have HIV are out there,with different needs than men, surviving in a different way than men do. I know that most women prefer to be guided, not confronted. If a woman needs help to (re)gain her self-esteem, she doesn'tneed to be broken in order to get reconstructed (as is often donein some therapy and rehab centres). I was in that situation,broken and disillusioned, when Louise, a social worker, foundme. Others had given up on me because I'd relapsed too manytimes. But Louise gave me hope that some day I could be happyagain. She also gave me a lot of practical info that I could use.Even though my goal was to stop using drugs someday, Louisetaught me about safe injection (and safe sex, of course!). SEX AND DRUG USERS: WE STILL DO IT! Over the years, I've observed that messages about safeinjection have had a positive effect on the habits of users.Most know that sharing needles carries a high risk of HIV and hep C infection, and most are careful. But when it comes tointimacy, drug users are like anyone else: They think condomsare for other people. The safe-sex aspect of prevention is toooften overlooked in info targeted at users. Shooting up doesn'tstop someone from having a sex life...on the contrary! THE WAR AGAINST HIV AND HEP C I'm now one of many statistics about HIV and hepatitis C co-infection among IDUs. Fortunately, the HIV epidemic and thewave of hep C infections that continues to follow it have at least alerted the authorities. As a result, more money is nowbeing invested into the health of drug users. In order to reachthis population, the door had to be opened to new ideas. Boldprojects have been put in place and the situation in Canada isslowly beginning to improve. It's about time. ME AND MY METHADONE My methadone story illustrates both the remarkable resultsthat can be obtained from this approach as well as theurgent need to act quickly to help those who seek this form of aid. Methadone is a synthetic narcotic painkiller that produces many of the same effects as heroin or morphine, only it doesn'tget you high. It allows a person who is heroin-dependent to getSylvie Viral load: around 50. Volunteer at various AIDS organizations, including Voices of Positive Women,Kingston AIDS Project and Street Health. Artist. Kingston, Ontario For seven years I lived in an abusive relationship. I left in 1995, when I realized my partner was never going tochange. He never helped me and onlymade me feel worse. If you\u00d5re in abad relationship, first of all findsomeone you can talk about it with.Go to your best girlfriend and don\u00d5ttell anyone else about it. Go to ashelter. Sometimes you may need torelocate, so be ready for it.Sometimes hearing from others in asimilar situation might help. This iswhat I did for myself. And after sevenyears in misery, I was able to meetsomeone else, withdraw from drugs and have a healthy child. Being onmethadone has helped me. I\u00d5ve been on it since April 2001. It doesn\u00d5tinterfere with my meds, and it hasn\u00d5t caused me any problems yet. Ithelps me deal with my mood swings and feel more stable. Things are looking good for me now. It was a great bonus to learn that my child is negative. - Cindy Reardon, 34 Diagnosed with HIV: April 1995; CD4 count: 1,324; Viral load: 167. Harmreduction worker. Toronto, Ontario Some women with HIV are more vulnerable than others because they have a \u00d2drug user\u00d3 label on theirmedical file. So when the time comesfor pain medication, they\u00d5re notproperly treated. I want to make surethat I\u00d5m honest with my doctor if I\u00d5mdoing drugs recreationally, just like Iwould be if I was drinking alcohol. Wehave to educate doctors about druginteractions, and we have to empower women and make them as safe aspossible while they\u00d5re using drugs and taking HIV meds. There\u00d5s more info out there for men and more of the larger agencies cater to men. I\u00d5m a lesbian, and my issues are not all the same as those ofheterosexual women (and after seven years of living with HIV, my issues aredifferent than they were when I was first diagnosed). There is some info outthere, but very few support groups for women like me. - For 4 free issues/year of Pusher d\u00d5Infos phone: Junkphood www.needleex VANDU (Vancouver Area Users) phone: 604.683.8595 www .vandu.or g IDUUT (Illicit Toronto) phone: 416.920.2746 e-mail: iduut@r ogers.com Canadian Check out pre*fix , CATIE\u00d5s new harm HIV+ users!

This tends to happen slowly, usuallywithin two weeks of starting these meds. In somecases, your methadone dose may need to be adjusted. Y our doctor and pharmacist should know these things. But, you have to tell them about allthe drugs you're taking if you want them to help you.The same goes with your doctor when it's time totalk about street or recreational drugs. For instance,if your HIV treatment includes ritonavir and docdoesn't know that you do ecstasy every weekend, heor she won't be able to tell you that ritonavir has atendency to increase the level of any drug (legal ornot, your body doesn't bother with the laws). DRUGS AND VIOLENCE When you do hard drugs, you enter anotherworld. All facets of your life are altered. Thefact that drugs are illegal has a lot to do with that. It's a jungle out there and everyone's fightingfor his or her own piece of fake paradise. Y ou haveto hide, lie and search for money constantly. In theend, it changes you. Like many other women, I became dependent on a man who, in exchange for a roof and a bit ofdope, abused me both physically and verbally. It'snot easy to help women in such a situation. It takesa great amount of courage and help to quit a guy.Most of the time, there are other considerations (ifyou leave, will you have to do sex work to afford tolive? Do you have children who will go hungry?Will he threaten you?). It's not easy to get out ofthese situations, especially if love is involved. Itcould take more than a few times before yousucceed. Women should not be afraid to ask forhelp, even if it's the tenth time they do. There is noguilt to be felt. If the person who is supposed to behelping you can't understand that, try to seek helpsomewhere else. CITIZENS LIKE ANY OTHER The lights came on for me when I learned that drug users in Australia and France hadformed groups to defend their rights. I could hardly believe it! That's how I came to believe inharm reduction. People who use drugs are, aboveall, human beings and citizens like any other anddeserve respect. That's why users have to becomeinvolved and must be present when decisions are made. -through the day without having to do illegal drugs and without being dope-sick because they need more. Methadone lasts longerthan heroin, for up to 24 hours, and people can drink it once aday, every day, instead of having to shoot heroin every eight hoursin order to not get sick (to not have the symptoms of withdrawalafter 8-12 hours, because drugs like heroin create a physicaldependence). Methadone is legal but has to be prescribed. After injecting heroin for several years, I wanted to change my life. Easier said than done! My entire life had beentransformed by the drug \u2014 my thoughts, activities, needs.Everything revolved around the next hit and the fear of nothaving it. I tried several methods to quit. I underwent threedetox treatments at the hospital, complete with drugs to easethe pain of withdrawal. I spent time in treatment centres thatpromoted the cold-turkey approach, but I relapsed each time Ileft. Short-term therapies also failed, and an 18-monthtreatment program had no better result. When my outreach worker suggested I try a methadone program, I had pretty much lost faith. Still, I registered for itanyway. At the time, money was scarce and the number of placeswas limited. The waiting list was two years long. The eligibilitycriteria were such that pregnant women and HIV+ women wereadmitted first. I was neither pregnant nor positive, so I addedmy name to the list and waited. Obviously, I continued to doheroin during that time because I was unable to stop. Two years later, it was finally my turn. By then, however, it was as a woman infected with both HIV and hep C that Ientered the methadone program. I am no doubt one of many to whom that happened, but fortunately things have improved. In Quebec, for example,funding has been secured and the number of places available inmethadone programs has increased. There are also alternativesavailable now, such as low-level methadone substitution and anoutpatient detox program. Although it doesn't give me the buzz that dope did, my daily methadone treatment spares me from the agony of withdrawaland the defeat of repeated relapses. As a result, I haven'tinjected drugs in eight years, which is a miracle for someonewhom several doctors had described as \"beyond hope.\" Myexperience hasn't left me bitter. But I continue to fight so noone else has to go through what I did. And I continue to takemy daily bottle of 75 mg of methadone, along with my HIVmedications, which I've taken since 1996. Methadone can interact with some HIV meds and other one or more of these meds, methadone levels in your blood may either increase or decrease SPRING 2003 43How is your health, Ana? It's good. My CD4 count is above 400 and my viral load is undetectable. I've done great for the pastnine years. Naturally, from time to time I feeldown. But I'm doing better than many youngpeople. I think it has to do with my genes and my attitude. I'm optimistic, no matter what. How did you learn you had HIV? My husband was in the hospital in 1993, very sick with pneumonia. Dr. Ian Mackay, an AIDSspecialist, was on call in the intensive care unit.When he looked at my husband's chart, he had the idea my husband might have AIDS. I gavepermission for the test. It was positive. My husband had had a blood transfusion during majorsurgery in 1985. But back then he didn't have anysymptoms of HIV infection. At our age, no one waseven thinking about it. He also had emphysema.Really, he died of lung cancer. So after he tested positive, they tested you? Y es. In a way I knew: We were husband and wife.We had a healthy marriage. What was it like after you were diagnosed? It was hard for my husband. He was reallydepressed. Dr. Mackay was very good to us. Hecame every night to talk to my husband. I'll neverforget that. He also helped me get over the shock. It sounds like you have a good relationship with him. Dr. Mackay is my friend. So is my regular doctor,Dr. McLeod. How often do you see your regular doctor? Once a month, sometimes more. T ogether with the nurses we're a team. My job is to come forcheckups and blood tests and to take mymedication regularly, exactly as the doctorprescribes. Y ou must listen to what your doctorsays. And always ask questions. Recently my doctor asked me to meet with a group of first-year medical students, to see if they couldmake a correct diagnosis. They examined me andasked me questions.Did they diagnose you correctly? Not really, but that wasn't important. At the end, many ofthem thanked me for participating. They'll be studying mycase for 18 months. I want to do what I can to help. Do you have any particular health problems now? I had some problems with my breasts; it was a side effect ofa medication I was taking. But we've changed that one, soI'm much better now. Do you use any complementary therapies? Y es, a few, including one for my arthritis, which is reallyhelping me. I also take vitamin E, for my breasts. My doctormakes sure these don't interfere with the medicines I'm taking. Do you attend any support groups? Y es, I'm good at baking so I bring cake. And I'm good atlistening. The other people trust me and tell me what's intheir heart and soul. This way, I'm giving back what I'vereceived. I'm very thankful to God that he gave me such agood way to help people. I never judge. I never ask questionsthat could hurt them. I know God loves me. It helps a lot tohave religion and beliefs. Do the people at your church know you have HIV? No, acceptance is still far away. I tell who I want to tell;that's my privilege. Have you ever met anyone like yourself in the AIDS community? Y es and no. I'm always the oldest one, but I don't care. I ampart of them. I understand them, and they respect and care for me. I met two young African women who are just like me:strong, hard-working women, with great love for their families.I grew up in Europe, decades before these women were evenborn, and yet we love each other like sisters raised by the samegood mother. We have such beautiful talks together. Womenmust share their strength and support each other. What inspires you? My family's love and acceptance. We were together when Ilearned I had HIV and we've been together ever since. Andvolunteering in the AIDS community makes me happy andgives me hope. I can be \"grandmother\" to people who needfamily love. My doctor says I will probably die of old age \u2014that makes me live. -ANA IS A 77-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER.

Works at various community-based organizations. Toronto, Ontario Having experienced an extended period of time when I slept no more thanan hour or two per night, sleep is something that I hold in high esteem. I had a terrible time when I started taking antiretrovirals; I couldn\u00d5t sleep atall for a few months. When you can\u00d5t sleep, you can\u00d5t cope, your sense ofreality gets totally distorted. For one or two days you can go without sleep,but after three months, it\u00d5s just insane. You go mad.What changed that state is that I went to a naturopathic doctor, Ken Luby,and he gave me one homeopathic remedy, which totally shifted the cycle Iwas in. I only took one dose, and from that moment on I was able to sleepagain. It was very, very powerful. My whole life changed. Ken Luby is my hero.He was profoundly helpful. Ever since then, having a good night\u00d5s sleep has become a priority for me. I do Feldenkrais exercises before I go to bed. They\u00d5re very slow movementswhich totally bring things into the moment by relaxing and slowing downyour whole being. They\u00d5re grounding and centering. You don\u00d5t have to exertmuch energy to do them, so they\u00d5re easy to do at night when you\u00d5re tired.I\u00d5ve always done exercise and body work because they take you out of yourhead and bring you into the moment. I find that both useful and meaningful\u00d1 getting out of my thoughts and into the moment. -Hazra, 46 Diagnosed undetectable.Aromatherapist. Reflexologist. Reiki practitioner. Student. York Region, Ontario Every morning when I wake up, I deal with exhaustion. So I do Reiki,bringing the universal energy to myself. It\u00d5s the best self-help method I know. After Reiki, I do aromatherapy \u00d1 blending essential oils according tomy mood and physical condition \u00d1 and massage myself. The oils help mewhen I have nausea, diarrhea, depression. After the massage, I go about myday feeling really good. Each morning I design a very reasonable schedule for myself, so at the end ofthe day I\u00d5ve been able to do everything I planned. This brings me a feeling ofsatisfaction. I do various things to keep my body moving, such as bellydancing and Qi Gong. I like the belly dancing, it\u00d5s not only exercise but alsofun. This in itself creates a feeling of well-being. I also get regular treatments(massage, reflexology, trager, shiatsu, Reiki) from other practitioners. Mypersonal belief is that there is a physical aspect to any disease, but there\u00d5salso a psychosomatic aspect to it, and it\u00d5s important to work with everyaspect for self-healing. To me, psychotherapy has become more of a spiritualjourney and has helped me bring changes to my life and relationships. - SPRING 2003 45THE POSITIVE SIDE44Looking back on my health, I\u00d5m sure I contracted HIV in1990, but it wasn\u00d5t confirmed until 1992, when Larry, my boyfriend of two years, was diagnosed with AIDS. Two months later, Itested positive. From day one, I tried to cultivate a positive attitudeabout my life with HIV . In an effort to keep myself grounded and calmand not get too psyched out, I kept my diagnosis under wraps for awhile because I didn't want other people's reactions and fears to affectme. I tried a bunch of alternative therapies such as acupuncture andherbs \u2014 some didn't work for me but those that did I continue to usetoday. I thought if I could keep my mind, body and spirit in synch, myhealth would remain stable. My CD4 count was quite high in thosedays. Larry, however, upon diagnosis had full-blown AIDS. As Larry's health declined, he made preparations to die and made peace where necessary. He passed away on August 14, 1994, with meby his side. I was so proud of him. He made death look easy. After wesaid goodbye, Larry took his last breath. All his energy was suckedinward, as if his spirit completely entered his body on his last breath,flew down to his feet, turned and shot up and out through the crownof his head. My heart was pounding and my body shaking as I heldhis hand. I was in complete awe of the beauty of this moment. I feltthe light in the room, and now that I've since assisted in the birth ofmy goddess-daughter, I have to say, the energy in the room whenLarry died was very similar \u2014 sacred and beautiful \u2014 to the energy Ifelt at the birth. I share this experience because it was extremelyempowering to me. Larry taught me not to fear death. I've been living with the virus now for 13 years. Complementary therapies such as massage, acupuncture, Traditional ChineseMedicine, herbs, yoga, meditation and visualization help me torejuvenate and stay optimistic about my health. For a long time I wasreluctant to take HIV drugs because I had a bias against Westernmedicine, especially after having watched Larry suffer from the effectsof high-dose AZT that was commonly prescribed in the early 1990s.But four years ago I added a drug cocktail to my therapies. At 30 CD4cells, my immune system had become so depleted and I'd developedthe opportunistic infection MAC. So I finally backed down anddecided to believe my doctor when she told me I didn't have long > continued on page 46TREE OF LIFEPart of living in balance is feeling one\u00d5s connectionto nature, to the Universe and to other people.Notice your connection with the world around you and don\u00d5t miss the synchronicity of events in your day.This is one way the Universe speaks to us. If you can\u00d5t be in nature, bring nature to yourself byclosing your eyes and visualizing or feeling yourselfwalking in the woods or along the water\u00d5s edge. Yourbody can still reap the benefits of actually being there.Breathe deeply and let serenity reign.You need only 5 minutes to do this. Designate a timeand space for yourself (even if it means locking yourselfin the washroom). Sit in a comfortable position thatallows your spine to be erect. Gently close your eyes.See or sense yourself sitting under a magnificent tree.You chose the details (oak, maple, willow, palm). Inhaleand exhale through your nose, both to a count of 4. Oneach inhale, fill your belly up like a big balloon, up toyour chest, up to your shoulders, to a count of 4. Exhaleslowly to 4, contracting your belly toward your spine,releasing every last drop of breath. As you inhale, breathe in clean, life-supporting oxygen,produced by the tree. See a line of connection from thetree to your lungs. When you exhale, you are expellingtoxins from your body. The carbon dioxide you release isfood that\u00d5s essential to the tree. See a line of energyback to the tree. A symbiotic relationship exists. We aredeeply connected and dependent on each other forexistence. Feel your connection. Repeat this visualizationfor 5 to 10 minutes until you feel relaxed and grounded.You can use this simple exercise any time to relax.THE POSITIVE SIDE46Rebekka Valian is a member of Positive Women\u00d5s Network (www.pwn.bc.ca) in Vancouver, where she volunteers as areflexologist, aromatherapist and yoga teacher. She alsoteaches yoga at Friends for Life.> continued from page 44 to live. Although today my health is good (600 CD4 cells and an undetectable viral load), I'm experiencing side effects frommy medication, most notably lipodystrophy. My legs and faceare thinning while my waist is thickening. Seeing thesechanges in my figure is frustrating and it's an effort to keep myvanity in check. Practicing yoga has helped me to survive in more ways than one. The word yoga means \"to yoke\" or \"union.\" It's about uniting the body, mind and spirit in order to improve healthand increase self-awareness. This yoking also refers to the unionof the individual's consciousness with the larger infiniteconsciousness. The postures, which are synchronized with thebreath, allow you to check in deeply with your body and quietyour busy mind. On a physiological level, yoga improves bloodcirculation, respiration, digestion, liver detoxification andlymphatic drainage. Y ou're building your immune system whenyou do yoga. It's also helped melt away a few inches and,thankfully, helps to alleviate depression as well. When a person is depressed, we sometimes use expressions like \"heavy-hearted\" or \"disheartened\" to describe thisunpleasant state. Depression can be a reaction to too muchstress. Literally, depression stresses the heart and body andoveractivates the adrenal system. When practicing yoga, yourflow of stretches and breathing techniques becomes a movingmeditation in which the body is able to deeply relax. Thebody's autonomic nervous system switches into theparasympathetic mode, giving every cell much needed rest.As a result, the mind and body quiet, and a beautiful stillnesscomes over you in which deep healing can occur. Y ou feel asense of calm and, with regular practice, the heaviness ofdepression often disperses. (For more info on yoga for PHAs,see \"Introduction to Y oga,\" The Positive Side , fall/winter 2001.) Stress is an inhibitor to health. When one's immune system is compromised, it is essential to de-stress in as many ways aspossible. Presently, for me, this means not working and using thistime to return to health. I'm learning to live in balance, creatingspace and time away from my busy life to nourish and rechargemyself. Having the courage to say \"no\" at times and simplify mylife is essential for the restoration of my immune system. Contracting HIV has been an invitation for me to slow down, be more mindful and savour the moment. Every activityis more enjoyable when I take time to really stay present andexperience what I'm doing \u2014 whether it's practicing yoga orcooking dinner. I encourage you to allow yourself some down-time to meditate, take a walk in nature, do yoga, receive amassage or take a nap (in a hammock, if you can!). -Drink lots of water (8 glasses a day). If your CD4 count is below 200, try to purchase water that uses reverse osmosis to filter cryptosporidium and giardia(read the labels). Our bodies are made up of 75% to 90%water, and water flushes out toxins from the body andhydrates every living cell. Eat living foods (fresh fruits and greens, whole grains, soy products, juicing). Sense the vibratory energy of your food. Observe the visible life of a fresh green salad vs. over-processed, overcooked food. Avoid theprocessed-food aisles in your grocery store as much aspossible. Check that the life hasn\u00d5t been processed out of your food\u00c9again, read the labels! Slow down and savour the moment. Be mindful and present. Rest and relax. Get a massage to boost your body\u00d5s circulation and immune system. Trust yourself. Listen to your inner voice. Keep a journal. Dare to fulfill a dream. Learn the power ofintent. Put out a wish or prayer and don\u00d5t be surprised if you get what you ask for. Remember to give thanks. Rejoice. Celebrate in a favourite activity. Try Indian tablas or African or Native drumming. Studies show that you can boost your white blood cell count when you drum. Exercise. Get your heart pumping and blood circulating. And don\u00d5t forget to breathe! You\u00d5re flushing out toxins and boosting your immune system. Walk, swim, dance, cycle\u00c9pick your favourite. Not only will itbenefit you physically, it will also lift your spirits. Sexcounts as exercise! Speak sweetly to yourself. Your words to yourself can either heal or harm you. Speaking andthinking positive thoughts raises the vibration within youand your environment. Psyche yourself up. Every cell inyour body will respond. Each of us is unique and holdsdifferent gifts and perspectives. Respect yourself. Seek out help. Utilize your AIDS organizations. They may have resources or programs that make your lifeeasier. Opportunities may exist that you are unaware of.Connect with others. If you live in a remote area, reachout and access e-mail or toll-free numbers. Communicatingwith other women with similar issues is an invaluableresource of support and information. Accept support from family and friends.

Let\u00d5s talk. I have found beauty in so many places, Not just in money or pretty faces.I've found beauty in darkness, when I was alone,In back alleys or under a stone.I've found it in smiles,I've found it in tears,Sometimes in minutes, sometimes in years.I've found it in giving of myself,Or dusty old memories I'd left on a shelf.I've found it in things I couldn't replace,Like caring and trust in somebody's face.I've found it in people who don't even know it's there.And puppies and kittens who sit on my chair.I've found so much beauty mixed with the pain,By this time tomorrow I will find some again.
