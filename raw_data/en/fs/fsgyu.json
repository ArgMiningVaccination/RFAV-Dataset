Staff of the following programs provided information for this handbook: Cancer Patient Education, Medical Oncology, Oncology Nursing, and the Patient & Family Supp ort Services Program 3 Welcome This guide provides answers to many common questions about chemotherapy treatment; offering ideas to prepare for tr eatment and describing what it will be like. It also contains suggestions to hel p you care for yourself during treatment. Our goal at the University of Michig an Comprehensive Cancer Center is to provide our patients and families with th e highest quality care. This includes administering the necessary treatments as well as providing the education and support needed throughout these treatments. This booklet should be used in combination with the Chemotherapy and You booklet produced by the National Cancer In stitute. This booklet is your main resource for information about chemother apy, managing its side effects and understanding how to prevent them. It is very important to use this book as a resource throughout your chemotherapy treatment course. Copies of this booklet and other educational materials can be found at the Patient Education Resource Center (called the \"PERC\") on level B1 of the Cancer Center. Your health care team will also provide you with verbal and written instructions about your chemotherapy treatment. You should refer to these materials for information about your specific treatment plan. 4 What is Chemotherapy? Chemotherapy (chemo) is the treatment of cancer with drugs that can destroy cancer cells. These drugs often are calle d \"anticancer\" drugs. Most people don't know that cancer chemotherapy includes a variety of drugs that are given in a variety of ways such as: Drugs that are given into the bloodstream through an IV (called 'intravenous' chemotherapy). These dr ugs can be given over minutes or hours called an infusion . Drugs are also given slowly and cont inuously over several days using a pump. This is called a continuous infusion. Drugs that are taken by mouth as pills or liquids (called oral chemotherapy ) Drugs that are placed directly into a body area (called intracavitary chemotherapy ) Drugs that are placed on the skin as creams This booklet will focus on all cancer in fusion treatments (inc luding continuous infusion treatments) at the University of Michigan. Inform ation regarding the other types of chemotherapy treatment will be given to you by your health care team. This is a good place to stop and re view the section called \"Questions and Answers About Chemotherapy\" in Chemotherapy and You (page 1). About Clinical Trials Your doctor may suggest that you consider participating in a clinical trial (also called a research study or protocol). 5 Clinical trials are used to test and de velop new treatments. The goal of these trials is to find ways to improve treatmen t. While a trial or study is active or In progress we will not know whether an y potential benefit has been found. The trial must be closed and the data analyzed before the treatment is made widely available to patients. There may be some additional risks associ ated with research. Your doctor will discuss in detail with you bo th the potential risks and benef its of jo ining the trial. Your written permission will be given before you can start on a clinical trial. Oversight committees at th e University of Michigan Medical Center conduct an extensive review of all clin ical trials. These committees include an Institutional Review Board or IRB composed of other cancer doctors, doctors in other specialties and lay people. The IRB reviews all clinical trials before they are available to patients and ag ain at different times duri ng the research. This ensures that the clinical trial remains safe for patients. All patients who are on a clinical trial re ceive the best supportive care possible. Their reactions to the treatment are watched closely. A doctor can stop the treatment if it does not seem to be wo rking. The patient may choose to leave the study at any time. If a patient leav es a study for any reason, standard care will be started. Clinical trials are voluntary. Your cancer will be treated whether you decide to join a trial or not. Talk to your doctor about any questions you have regarding clinical trials at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. 6 Preparing for Chemotherapy Getting ready for chemotherapy can be sc ary. Patients often experience many different feelings. We offer these 4 ways to best prepare you for chemotherapy treatment. You will be called by a cancer nurse educator in the Cancer Skills Lab prior to treatment. The nurse wi ll review your chemotherapy education and is available to answer questions yo u may have before treatment. An appointment can be made at no charge Monday through Friday from 8am to 4pm by calling ( 734) 232-6366. 4 ways to prepare for chemotherapy: #1 Learn about chemotherapy To understand what chemotherapy is, ho w it is administered and what side effects may occur during or after your treatment, read the booklet Chemotherapy and You before your treatment begins. This booklet provides information that will be used before, during and after treatment. As you review this material, write down your questions in the area at the end of this booklet. Bring this booklet with your questions to your clinic appointment and discuss them with a member of your treatment team. It is helpful to look at the chemotherapy educational material given to you before you receive your first treatment. This includes items for cl inical trials such as an informed consent, dr ug information sheets, nutrit ion information and more! This can be a lot to review, so it might be helpful to choose an information gatherer. This is someone who will read the information and let you know what you need to know, when you need to know it. 7 #2 Develop a flexible plan Chemotherapy is given in separate \"se ssions\" over one or more days. These sessions are grouped together and called a \"cycle\". Each gr ouping or \"cycle\" of chemotherapy is repeated several time s with a gap of time in-between. The time between cycles of chemotherapy is usually two to three weeks, but will vary according to the type of chemotherapy. Your doctor will review the usual sched ule for your chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy schedules change often during a cycle for a number of reasons. Thus, you will need to be flexible about your schedule in advance. Make room for treatment delays, changes in start/stop date, etc. #3 Schedule a pretreatment dental checkup if timing allows The mouth can be a source of infectio n during some types of chemotherapy treatment. For this reason, it is helpf ul to have a checkup before you begin treatment if you have not had one in the last 6 months. If a dental check-up is not possible before your treatment begins, discuss this with your cancer doctor. This is a good time to review the mouth care section in the Chemotherapy and You booklet. You can find it on pages 35- 37. Follow the instructions for mouth rinses that are described in this section. #4 Take care of YOU Treatment can be a stressful time for yo u and for those around you. It is important that you focus on your needs during this time. The following is a list of suggestions to help you: 9 Ask for Help Select someone close to you to hel p organize help for the chores and activities you would normally do. Le arning to accept help from others can be difficult, but may be necessary. If you can learn to let others 8 help...they'll be happy doing it, and you'll be happy to have things done! 9 Reduce Stress Identify one or two ways to reduce stress and relax. Practice them before your treatment begins. Plan to use these techniques on the day of treatment. 9 Be Comfortable Plan to be comfortable during your infusion chemotherapy appointment. Most patients like to wear loose, comfortable clothing. Also, you may need to roll-up your sleeves. Wear clothing that allows you to do this. Techniques for Stress Reduction These are a few suggested activities. Every patient is differ ent and will find help in different ways. If an activity doesn't help, try another. Deep Breathing Exercises Biofeedback Guided Imagery Distraction: Music, Art, Hobbies Journaling Visit the Patient Education Resource Center on level B1 of the Cancer Center for information on these programs at the University of Michigan or visit our website @ www.mcancer.org 9 Dress for Safety Patients receiving infusion chemot herapy may experience sedation or other symptoms that place them at risk for falling. We are committed to keeping you safe in the c hemotherapy infusion areas. Please help us by wearing sensible, stable shoes like athletic shoes or slip-resistant socks. Have a thermometer in your house.... and be able to read it easily. 9 Gather Supplies Stock up on items you may need after treatment such as dressing supplies, medications, food and beverages. All patients should also have a thermometer in their house and be able to read it. 9 Frequently Asked Questions Should I eat before treatment? Many patients worry about eating be fore their treatment. Please eat according to your normal schedule, don't skip any meals and take your medications as scheduled. Infusion Chemotherapy: You may find it best to eat a light meal and avoid fried, spicy, or acidic foods prior to your treatment. Do NOT skip meals prior to treatment unless your doctor tells you to . Oral Chemotherapy: If you are taking chemother apy by mouth, be sure to ask your medical team if you should take it with food or not. How long will I be there? It is best to plan on spending most of the day at the center for your first chemotherapy treatment. Some patients may have their treatment finished in several hours, but this is difficult to pr edict. Once you have received the first treatment, the staff will be better able to predict how long you should allow for all future treatments. Infusion Chemotherapy: The length of infusion chemotherapy treatments vary. This depends on the type of treatment you will receive and how you receive it. In addition to the treatment itself, additional time will be spent receiving anti-nausea medications, Your first treatment visit may last a full day. 10 medications that prevent reactions, or hydrating fluids. You will also spend time learning about your tr eatment, having your questions answered and making plans for further treatments. Chemotherapy medications are made after you have arrived and your doctor has approved the infusion. Many patients will experience waiting time while chemotherapy is prepared. Continuous Infusion Chemotherapy: Patients who receive continuous in fusion chemotherapy through a pump device will need additional time for their appointment. This additional appointment time is used fo r the following activities: learning how to manage t he infusion pump at home, identification of and referral to the home care agency that will provide your care in the home, and setting up the infusion pump and verifying its calibrations and settings. What should I bring? Please bring the following items with you on the day of treatment: Your insurance card Your hospital registration (blue) card The names and addresses of your referring physician and primary care physician A list of the herbs and supplements you are currently taking A list of all medications you are currently taking A designated driver if this is your first treatment. Assistive devices such as canes or walkers that you use at home. Your education folder 11 These items are OPTIONAL to bring with you on the day of treatment: A portable cassette player, iPod or compact disc player with relaxing music A small cooler with snacks, beverages or lunch for yourself (a refrigerator and microwave oven are available) The Cancer Center offers several progra ms for patients and families while in the center that include: A free wireless guest network for internet access. You must bring your own computer with a wireless network card to access this service. iPod and iTouch loan program. These devices are offered to patients and families for loan wh ile in the center. You may check these out at the Patient Education Resource Center at no cost. You will be asked to leave your drivers license at the center while your device is in use. Can I drive? Arrange for a driver for your first chemotherapy treatment. You may receive medications that make it unsafe for you to drive. The length of treatment varies, making it difficult to anticipate a \"pick-up\" time after your treatment. If your driver is not st aying with you, it is best that they are accessible and flexible about the time of pick-up. We will be happy to call your driver 30 minutes before you are done with your treatment. 12 Can I bring my family to the infusion area? Due to space constraints and safety concerns, only 1 adult visitor may accompany you to the infusion area. For their safety, children under 16 years of age are not allowed in the infusion area. Is food available? A small nourishment room is located within the infusion area. The refreshments are available free of charge for patients an d include juice, coffee, tea, milk and crackers.

Will my health insurance cover chemotherapy treatment costs? It is important to talk to your health insurance plan about what costs it will pay for, BEFORE you begin c hemotherapy treatment. The Chemotherapy and You booklet offers questions to ask your health insurance plan on page 7. The UM Cancer Center Billing and Customer Service Office staff is available to discuss questions about chemotherapy costs and billing. They can be reached at (734) 647-8663. Information about financial assistance and counseling at the UM Cancer Center can be found in the Patient & Family Support Services Handbook, at the Patient Education Resource Center or online at www.mcancer.org . 14 Treatment Day: Infusion Chemotherapy Where Will I Receive My Treatment? Where will I receive my treatment at the Cancer Center? The infusion room staff will decide which of the infusion areas is best suited for your type of treatment. Patients are scheduled to arrive in the Cancer Center for most appointments, but may be transported to the Med INN infusion area or the 8A infusion area for treatment . Infusion chemotherapy is given in 3 infusion areas within the medical center, on the inpatient units and at the UM Canton satellite clinic. The 3 areas within the medical center include: 1. The infusion areas in the Cancer Center building, (Level B1 of the Cancer Center) 2. The infusion area in the Med INN building , (Level 4 of the Med INN) 3. The infusion room on the Adult Inpatient Unit (8A unit of University Hospital). The Cancer Center Infusion Area at Canton located in the Canton Health Center. This is a sa tellite clinic within the University of Michigan Health System. It is located east of 1-275 and west of 1-94. A map is located at the back of this handbook. Specially trained and chemotherapy certified nurses administer treatments and care for patients receiving treatment in each infusion area. 15 Where Do I Park? Cancer Center Infusion Area AND Med INN Infusion Area: Park in the cancer center pa rking lot, which is labeled \"Lot B\". Remember to bring your parking ticket to the infu sion area with you for validation to receive reduced parking rates. 8A Infusion Room at University Hospital: Park in the University Hospital Parking area which is labeled \"Lot A\". Remember to bring your parking ticket to the infusion area with you for validation to receive reduced parking rates. Infusion at Canton Center Enter the parking lot from Saltz Road. Follow the signs to infusion, park near the main entrance to the building. There is no charge for parking at this center. Where Do I Report and \"Check-IN\"? Cancer Center Infusion Area: Enter the building on the ground or \" B2\" level. The infusion area is one floor up, Level B1 at reception area A. If you are having blood drawn before your treatment, you should proceed to the blood drawing area on level B2. Once the blood is drawn, go up one level to B1 and c heck-in at reception area A. If you have a doctor's appointment on the same day as treatment, you should check-in at your doctor's cl inic first. Once your doctor appointment is completed, proceed to infusion check-in at reception area A. Have your blue registration card ready and sign in at the check-in desk. 16 8A Infusion Room University Hospital: Enter the University Hospital building on level 1 or level 2. Follow signs to the University Hospital \"East Elevators\" . Take the east elevators to the 8th level and follow the signs to \"8A\". Once on the unit, proceed to the window with the information sign above it. Med Inn Infusion Area: Enter the Cancer Center building on level \"B2\" or the ground level. Check in at the reception desk in t he lobby. They will direct you to the Med INN infusion area. Infusion at Canton Center: Refer to the map at the back of this bo ok. The Canton Center Clinics are located in Canton, Michigan at the intersection of Canton Center and Saltz Roads. Enter the complex from Saltz Road, park in the designated area and proceed through the main entrance doors. There is an information desk and staff directly in fr ont of you as you enter the building. They will check you in for your appointment. What happens during the infusion treatment? Chemotherapy treatment is a complex process. Your treatment will begin with your doctor, who will evaluate your medical status and determine if treatment is possible. This often happens the same day as your scheduled treatment and requires blood work. Once your doctor approves treatment, orders for the chemotherapy and supportive care are sent to the pharmacy for preparation. Arranging to have your blood work drawn the day PRIOR to chemotherapy will help reduce time waiting for results before treatment can begin. Blood drawing locations are listed at the back of thi s book . 17 The chemotherapy preparation process can take several hours. During this time you may take a pager from the infusion check-in staff and move around the health center. The infusion staff will page you when your chemotherapy is prepared. 18 Continuous Infusion Chemotherapy (Chemotherapy Pumps) Chemotherapy that is given slowly over 1 or more days is called continuous infusion chemotherapy. It is given with a pump device that you will carry with you while the chemotherapy is infusing. Pumps are often attached to catheters or ports. They control how much an d how fast chemotherapy goes into the catheter or port. What does a continuous infusion involve? Home Care Continuous infusion chemotherapy is a home care treatment. You will be followed by the University of Michigan's HomeMed\u00ae Program while receiving continuous infusion treatment. The HomeMed\u00ae staff arranges for supplies and equipment, checks your insu rance coverage and arranges to have your infusion disconnected once it is completed. All of these arrangements must be coordinated before your chemotherapy treatment can begin. Education Patients receiving a continuous infusion are taught to care for their pump and will manage and troubleshoot alarms or problems that may occur at home. This may be overwhelming as you ar e also learning about chemotherapy treatment in general. Our nurse educator s in the Cancer Center Skills Lab will work with you and your family; making sure you are comfortable with the pump before your treatment begins. We have found that patients experience less stress and are better able to care for their pumps and themselves at home if they receive education PRIOR to the day of treatment. We will work wi th you and your doctor to arrange a teaching session with the cancer nurse ed ucators before the day of treatment. This requires an additional visit for patients who don't have tests or other 19 appointments scheduled before treatment . You will receive a continuous infusion pump training manual at this se ssion. The manual contains information specific to your pump and its alarms and settings, the supplies necessary, changing batteries and when to call for hel p. The nurse ed ucators will review all of this information with you at the teaching appointment. Coordination There are many steps involved in pr oviding chemotherapy with a pump at home. Arrangements must be made with the home care agency, supplies must be delivered, the pump must be calibrated and the chemotherapy prepared specifically for pump infusion. Each of these steps is complicated and involves different agencies and staff. We understand that this process is co mplicated. A U-M Cancer Center continuous infusion coordinator will help you through the process and ensure that it is as efficient as possible. Our coordinator will contact you to review your infusion appointments and will schedule t he teaching session as well. You may contact the coordinator at (734) 647-8579, Mo nday through Friday, 8am to 4pm. Where will I receive my chem otherapy pump treatment? If you receive chemotherapy before your pump connection, the HomeMed\u00ae nurse will meet you in the infusion ar ea. You will be connected to the pump and the continuous infusion at the end of your chemotherapy treatment. If you are receiving only a continuous infusion with a pump, the HomeMed\u00ae staff may arrange to meet you in the Sk ills lab. They will connect your pump and begin your infusion in the Skills lab ra ther than in the cancer infusion area. The Skills Lab is located on level 3 of the Med INN Building. Take the Med Inn elevators to level 3 and follow the signs to your right. 20 How long will I be there? Patients who receive contin uous infusion chemotherapy will need more time for their appointment. This additional appointment time is used for the following activities: learning how to manage t he infusion pump at home identification and referral to the home care agency that will provide your care in the home setting up the infusion pump and verifying it's calibrations and settings It is best to plan on spending most of the day at the center for your first chemotherapy treatment. Some patients may have their treatment finished in several hours, but this is difficult to pr edict. Once you have received the first treatment, the staff will be better able to predict how long you should allow for all following treatments. 21 After Chemotherapy Treatment Once your infusion is completed you will be sent home. Your doctor will review what is normal to experience afte r treatment when you discuss your chemotherapy plan. The Chemotherapy and You book is a valuable resource during the time after chemotherapy. Refer to it for any questions and then contact your health care team if you don't find answers. Your doctor and nurses are available at the numbers on the back page of this book. What can I expect? It is normal to be worried about the possible side effects of chemotherapy. These feelings can be overwhelming before chemotherapy begins. It is important to discuss your concerns with your doctor. Remember that not all patients experience side effects. In fact, many people have few or no side effects from their treatment. The severity and type of side effects that occur will depend on the treatment you are receiving. Even though some side effects might be expected, you should always notify your doctor if any side effects occur. Review the \"Side Effects and Ways to Manage Them\" section of Chemotherapy and You before you begin your treatment. You will find a detailed description of some of the common side effects of ch emotherapy, how to prevent them as well as how to manage them. Your health care team will continue to provide information to you as you progress thro ugh your treatments. Remember that 22 each chemotherapy treatment is different , and every patient will face different obstacles. When should I contact my doctor? Notify your doctor for the following: Notify your doctor or nurse if you are experiencing a side effect, even one that might be expected. See the phone numbers on the last page of this book. Shaking chills or fever (a temperature of 101 \u00b0 F or 38.3 \u00b0 C) Notify your doctor immediately if you develop a temperature, do not delay. Unusual cough, sore throat, lung congestion or shortness of breath Burning discomfort when you urinate Redness, pain or sores in your mouth Nausea, vomiting or inability to eat or drink for more than 24 hours. Diarrhea (loose, watery stools) for more than 24 hours. Constipation (no bowel movement in 2-3 days) Bleeding or unusual bruising Pain not controlled by your current medications Any new or unusual symptom that concerns you For Pump Problems: In general, you should contact Ho meMed for any problems with your pump, the chemotherapy itself or with your supplies. The HomeMed Number is 1-800-862-2731. 23 Precautions in the Home After Chemotherapy Treatment Precautions need to be taken to protect you and your caregivers from contacting the chemotherapy medicine . Chemotherapy leaves the body through urine, vomit, blood and stool. Most chemotherapy medications will be out of your body in less than 48 hours. We have outlined general precautions that you should follow during your infusion and for 2 days (48 hours) after your chemotherapy is done. In general, these precautions help you avoid a ll body fluids that may contain chemotherapy. Please talk to your health care team if you have questions about chemotherapy precautions. Hazardous Waste Container Place a container in your home to hold soiled gloves, dressings and items such as diapers that contain body wastes. T he size of the container will vary by the amount of supplies you are using. Hazardous waste containers should be ma de of heavy, puncture-proof plastic, have a lid and be marked \"Hazardous Waste\" for safety. Store it out of reach of children. Your local health department or public safety department can describe local codes or ordinances regarding disposin g of hazardous waste containers. Regulations prohibit the UM from acce pting your containers for disposal. Laundry Use gloves to handle laundry soiled with chemotherapy to keep it from contacting your skin. Wash any soiled li nen or clothes right away in your washer with your regular soap. If you do not ha ve a washer, place t he soiled items in a plastic bag until they can be washed. Discard the gloves in the hazardous waste container. 24 Skin Care Skin can become irritated from the chemotherapy. If you get chemotherapy or body wastes on your skin, wash the area with soap and water, then dry. Call your doctor if there is redness or irritati on on the skin that lasts longer than one hour. Body Wastes Small amounts of chemotherapy are present in urine, stool, and vomit. If you are exposed to any body wastes, wash the area with soap and water. Others in your household may use the same toilet as long as all waste is flushed down the toilet. If you use a commode, bedpan, urinal or a basin for vomiting, wear gloves when emptying the waste, rinse the contai ner with water and clean it at least once a day with soap and water. If you do not have control of your bla dder or bowels, use a disposable, plastic- backed pad, diaper or sheet to absorb urine and stool. When it becomes soiled, change immediately and wash the skin with soap and water. If you have an ostomy, wear glov es when emptying and changing the appliance. Diapers, pads and gloves so iled with chemotherapy wastes should be disposed of in the ha zardous waste container. If body wastes splash into your eyes, fl ush them immediately with water for 10 to 15 minutes and call your doctor. Pregnant and/or Breast Feeding Caregivers Pregnant or breast feeding women shou ld wear gloves and gowns when caring for patients receiving chemotherapy. This includes changing chemotherapy bags, discarding wastes and cleaning body substances such as diapers and \"baby spit\". 25 Sexual Activity and Pregnancy You should not have sexual activity for 48 hours after receiving chemotherapy because body fluids may contain chemotherapy. It is very important that you or your partner not get pregnant while having chemotherapy. You should use 2 forms of birth control to avoid pregnancy while you are using this medicine and for at least 6 months after your treatment ends. This is very important for both m en and women. Notify your physician if pregnancy occurs while you are receiving cancer treatment. Antiseptic hand lotions or gels can be better at killing germs. They should NOT be used if your hands are visibly soiled or have body fluids (such as blood) on them, use liquid soap and water instead. Off-brand hand gels can be less expensive. Always check the label for the gel or lotion to contain either ethyl alcohol (ethanol), normal propyl alcohol (n-propyl) or isopropyl alcohol in concentrations between 60-90%. Hand Washing Hand washing is one of the most important things you can do to prevent infection. Wash your hands before and after the following: Eating Preparing food Going to the bathroom Touching body fluids (yours and others) such as blowing your nose Working with plants or soil Using gloves for a task or procedure Supplies: Antibacterial soap or antiseptic loti on / gel that do not require water Paper towel Procedure for using antibacterial soap: 1. Wet your hands and wrists under running water. 26 2. Scrub vigorously with an antibacterial soap for 10 seconds. Work lather between fingers, under nails, over palm s and on backs of hands and wrists. Singing one chorus of \"Happy Birthday to You\" while washing your hands.... This usually takes about 10 seconds! 3. Rinse hands and wrists and dry with a clean paper towel. 4. Turn off faucet with a paper towel. Procedure for using antiseptic lotions and gels: 1. Place lotion or gel on the palm of your hand 2. Rub vigorously for 10 seconds. Work lotion or gel between fingers, under nails, over palms and on backs of hands and wrists. 3. Let your hands air dry. Facing Forward After Chemotherapy Treatment The end of cancer treatment is often a time to rejoice. You are probably relieved to be finished with the demand s of treatment and are ready to put the experience behind you. Yet at the same time, you may feel sad and worried. It's common to be concerned about whether the cancer will come back and what you should do after treatment. When treatment ends, you may expect life to return to the way it was before you were diagnosed with cancer. But it ca n take time to recover. You may have permanent scars on your body, or you ma y not be able to do some things you once did easily. Or you may even have emotional scars from going through so much. You may find that others think of you differently now - or you may view yourself in a different way. 27 One of the hardest things after treatment is not knowing what happens next. Many cancer survivors feel that they ha d lots of information and support during their illness, once treatment stopped, they enter a whole ne w world - one filled with new questions. There are a number of resources availabl e to help you once you complete your chemotherapy treatment including: The Facing Forward Program This booklet, written by the National Cancer Institute is available to all patients at the UM Cancer Center. If you don't receive one after your infusion concludes, contact the Pati ent Education Resource Center on Level B1 of the Cancer Center at (734) 647-8626. Facing Forward is also offered as a one day session four times a year, with speakers on topics described in the NCI booklet. This class is available at no cost to UM patients and offers the opportunity to meet experts on survivorship issues (such as worker's rights, legal issu es, managing health concerns etc.). Info rmation about future dates can be found online at www.cancer.org or by calling the CancerAnswerline at 1-800-865-1125. Patient Education Resource Center The Patient Education Resource Center (or PERC) offers many resources on issue after chemotherapy. The PE RC is located on level B1 of the Cancer Center and can be reached at (734) 647-8626. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 9am until 4pm. 28 Resources There are many resources available to patients and their families at the University of Michigan Comprehensiv e Cancer Center that will help you throughout your treatment. These resources can be found in the Patient and Family Support Services Handbook available in each clinic, at the Patient Education Resource Center and at our website. These services include: Information about patient and family resources can be found at the Patient Education Resource Center on Level B1 of the Cancer Center or online at www.mcancer.org Nutrition Services and the Nutrition Counseling Clinic Managing Emotions and t he PsychOncology Clinic Financial Assistance Programs Hair loss resources, community organi zations and websites for hair loss products Information about chemotherapy, side effects and resources available at the Patient Education Resource Center (PERC) Information about the Facing Forward Program Fertility Program Some men and women who receive chemotherapy become infertile, which means they are unable to have children.
