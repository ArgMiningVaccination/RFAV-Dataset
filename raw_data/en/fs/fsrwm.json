Herbalism is the use of plants for therapeutic purposes to treat and prevent disease and promote health. Although today there are dedicated herbalism schools to train would-be herbalists, the practice of using plants as remedies is traditional in many cultures. Whole medical systems such as [Ayurveda]and Traditional Chinese Medicine rely on herbal therapy for many of their treatments. Often, herbal medicines in the United States are derived from European or North American plants, but herbal practitioners may use medicinal plants from all over the world. Herbalism Overview Herbal therapy is practiced by a range of health professionals, from herbalists to [chiropractors](https://www.naturalhealers.com/chiropractic/) to naturopathic doctors. And with increasing numbers of patients interested in complementary therapies and dietary supplements, even conventional medical practitioners may seek out herbalism training to enhance their skill sets. A degree from an herbalism school may qualify you to become a physician or nurse, grow or manufacture herbs, study plants as an ethnobotanist, or teach others about herbal therapy. The Herbal Therapy Profession In the United States, an herbalist is a self-defined professional. Here are some herbalist career concentrations: - Growing herbs - \"Wildcrafting\" or picking herbs - Manufacturing herbal products - Teaching or counseling people about the use of herbs as medicine - Supplementing another profession, such as naturopathic medicine, [nutritionist diet plans](https://www.naturalhealers.com/nutritionist/job-description/)or [chiropractic duties](https://www.naturalhealers.com/chiropractic/). One branch of anthropology, called ethnobotany, studies the use of plants in other cultures, particularly their use as medicine. Ethnobotanists, who receive their training through the standard university system, have classified a number of medicinal herbs. Their work helps preserve the traditional folk medicine of indigenous people around the world. The American Botanical Council provides current ethnobotanical expeditions. Training and Education What You'll Study in Herbalism School Most herbal therapy training will include curriculum in botany and plant identification, pharmacology, human physiology, biochemistry, nutrition, the history and philosophy or herbalism, and issues of professional practice. Many herbal medicine schools also teach clinical skills such as assessment and recordkeeping. Average Length of Study To become a practicing herbalist, the [American Herbalists Guild](https://www.americanherbalistsguild.com/) recommends a program of at least 1600 hours of study at a school of herbal medicine, including a 400-hour clinical requirement. Naturopathic physicians must complete a bachelor's degree as well as a 4-year Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) program. Average Tuition Some basic distance learning programs in herbal therapy cost as little as $400 to $2,500. A full-time course of study may range from $5,000 to $15,000 per year. Naturopathic medical schools generally cost between $20,000 to $25,000 per year. Herbalism Certification Currently, 22 U.S. states, five Canadian provinces, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands require licensing for naturopathic doctors. For graduates of herbalism school, there is no specific federal- or state-level regulation. However, if you work as a chiropractor or other health practitioner, you may have to meet licensing requirements for that field in order to practice. Membership in the American Herbalists Guild can grant an additional degree of professionalism, since guild members are required to complete a set of standardized educational requirements.
