Ketamine assisted psychotherapy is a psychedelic-wellness treatment that uses ketamine, a safe and thoroughly tested anesthetic in use across the U.S. since 1970, to unlock the mind's healing potential. Ketamine assisted psychotherapy works due to ketamine's ability to jumpstart the creation and natural repair of synapses in the brain. These newly-formed or reconnected synapses act as information transport railways connecting to all your mind and body points. This innovative type of therapy is a safe and highly effective treatment for depressive disorders, PTSD, anxiety, OCD, migraines, suicidal thoughts, fibromyalgia, chronic pain syndrome, and CRPS.
