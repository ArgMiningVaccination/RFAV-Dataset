And while office workers may not face falling trees or unstable ladders, the long-term health dangers of [too much sitting](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-sitting-health) are real. Bad posture, lack of movement and the repetitive motion of typing can all contribute to negative health outcomes. While regular movement throughout the day is necessary, other therapeutic practices may be helpful. Financial Education Benefits Center (FEBC) is offering health and wellness benefits to eligible members that include discounts on alternative medicine, practices and therapies like yoga, Pilates, chiropractic and massage. \"We assume a lot of FEBC members are working in an office and sitting at a desk all day, which may be affecting their health,\" said Jennifer Martinez, manager at FEBC. \"They may be looking for something to help. Our alternative medicine benefit discounts can be used by individuals who are already familiar with alternative medicine, or who may be curious and need an excuse to try it.\" Eligible FEBC members who want to improve their flexibility, strength or spinal alignment might find help in a variety of therapeutic practices. Whether a movement practice like yoga or tai chi, or a therapy like chiropractic or massage, there are participating providers nationwide. While office workers, in particular, might enjoy the benefit, any eligible member is welcome to use it. To use the benefit, members can search for a participating provider online and receive a discount at the time of payment for services. No one solution is a cure-all, though. Experts warn that even exercise or movement before or after work alone are not enough to mitigate the effects of large chunks of time with no movement at all. [Good posture and frequent movement](https://breakingmuscle.com/fitness/working-out-isnt-enough-advice-for-desk-workers) are recommended throughout the work day to counteract muscle breakdown and lessen the risk of injury. If possible, experts also recommend [walking, instead of sitting](https://breakingmuscle.com/fitness/walking-the-most-underrated-movement-of-the-21st-century), during work breaks. That being said, alternative medicine and therapeutic movement can [change people's lives](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathryn-e-livingston/12-ways-yoga-changed-my-l_b_6400948.html). \"We hope our members who have access to this benefit use it as part of a healthy lifestyle in general,\" said Martinez. \"Our new health and wellness benefits are here to make healthy living easier.\" About Financial Education Benefits Center Financial Education Benefits Center is located in San Ramon, California.
