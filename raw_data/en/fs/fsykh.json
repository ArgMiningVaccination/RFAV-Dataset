On this page [Skip this page navigation](#toc-end) Why you should vaccinate Infectious diseases can spread among children and adolescents at school who are not vaccinated. As a parent, you can keep your kids healthy with routine health care and vaccines. Make sure your school-age children are up-to-date with their vaccinations. Infection from certain diseases can kill or seriously harm your child. Vaccines use weakened or killed virus or bacteria to trigger your child's natural immune response to provide long-term protection against a disease (without the risk of getting the disease). It is like a rehearsal for the immune system, so your child is prepared if they are exposed to the \"real\" disease. Vaccinations are safe Vaccinations do not cause [autism](https://immunize.ca/questions-and-answers). Scientific studies and reviews continue to show no relationship between vaccines and autism. [What you should know about vaccine ingredients ](https://immunize.ca/questions-and-answers) Some people won't develop immunity to a disease after being vaccinated, but the [vaccine itself cannot infect someone](http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/safety-securite-eng.php). If a vaccinated individual does contract a disease which they were vaccinated against, their illness will be less severe. When to get vaccines for your school-age children Between 4 and 6 years old, children should receive the following vaccines: In grade 7, children should receive the following vaccines: Between 14 and 16 years old, teens should receive the following vaccine: Preparing your child for vaccines Getting a vaccine can be stressful for some children. With some preparation and kid-friendly explanation, parents can help to make vaccine visits easier and less stressful. Talk to your health care provider or health unit if you have any questions about the vaccine your child will receive. Prepare your child before the visit. Be honest. Explain that shots can pinch or sting, but that it won't hurt for long. Tell your child that vaccines are important to keep them healthy. For younger children - Hold your child or cuddle them on your lap. - Use distractions like toys, bubbles, and books. For older children - Older children can use distractions like games, books, music, and talking about something unrelated to the vaccination. Deep breathing and/or counting, as well as keeping the arm relaxed and still may help to make the shot easier. - For children getting their shots at school clinics, tell them to let the nurse know if they feel nervous about getting vaccinated or if they feel faint or light-headed before, during, or after the vaccination. The clinic staff can help them through the process. Ask your health care provider or local public health unit about using topical anesthetics (medication that numbs the skin). After the visit, talk to your child about their experience. Let them know that it is normal to feel some mild reactions- like soreness in the arm where the shot was given- that will go away after a day or two. Offer some extra attention if they are feeling discomfort. Praise and reinforce that they are making positive healthy choices. Contact your doctor if anything concerns you.
