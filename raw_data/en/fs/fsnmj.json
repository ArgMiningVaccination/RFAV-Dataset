Information on criteria and spacing can be found here (tinyurl.com/y9dpmzn2). Influenza Vaccines Reminder: Children aged 6 months to under 9 years who are receiving the influenza vaccine for the first time should receive two doses four weeks apart. Children who have received a previous influenza vaccination need only a single dose. First booster doses Comirnaty 30mcg Those aged 18 years and over , approved from minimum 3 months after primary course. Those aged 16 & 17 years , approved from minimum 6 months after primary course. Those aged 12-15 years , not currently part of the programme but new guidance is now available to support prescribers. Nuvaxovid (18 years and over)First booster 6 months after primary course. Vaxzevria (18 years and over) First booster 3 months after primary course (off label - prescription and consent form required). Second boosters for 'at risk' groups Groups at greater risk of poor health outcomes may be given a second booster. A second booster is recommended, due to waning protection, for those at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 - a minimum of 6 months after a first booster. For those who are not considered at risk of severe illness from COVID-19, a two-dose primary course and a first booster dose provides very good protection against severe illness from COVID-19 at this time. Eligible population The following people are recommended to receive a second booster as a priority: p eople aged 65 years and over M ori and Pacific peoples aged 50 years and over r esidents of aged care and disability care facilities s everely immunocompromised people who received a three-dose primary course and a fourth dose as a firstbooster (noting this would be a fifth dose for these people) p eople aged 16 years and over who have a medical condition that increases the risk of severe breakthrough COVID-19 illness and p eople aged 16 years and over who live with disability with significant or complex health needs or multiplecomorbidities.SECTION 3 | UPDATES AND CLARIFICATION OF VACCINE SCHEDULES (1) In addition, a second booster is available for: a ll people aged 50 years and over h ealth, aged care and disability workers aged 30 years and over. Second booster doses in pregnancy Pregnant women are at higher risk of complications from COVID-19 disease compared to those who are not pregnant. Comirnaty 30mcg is recommended at all stages of pregnancy. First booster doses can be given from 3 months after completion of the primary course. Second booster doses are not recommended for healthy pregnant women as they are well protected with their primary course and first booster. If pregnant AND have eligible co-morbid conditions, and are therefore at higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19, they can receive a second booster 6 months after the first booster. Timing of a second booster A second booster dose may be given at least 6 months after the first booster dose. This is the minimum length of time to have between boosters. Incomplete courses need to be finished before giving the second booster. Those people who have not completed their primary course, or first booster, should do so before getting their second booster. For example, an immunocompromised person who has not had their third dose, may be given that, then their first booster, and finally the second booster at the normal intervals for these doses. Preferred vaccine The preferred vaccine for a second booster dose is Comirnaty 30mcg (from aged 16 years) however if clinically indicated from the age of 18 years Nuvaxovid or Vaxzevria can be used (these currently require prescription and consent form when used as a second booster). More information about boosters here (tinyurl. com/39vy43s2). More information about high risk groups here (tinyurl.com/42pf5u66). Vaccine spacing post COVID-19 disease Although COVID-19 vaccines can be given any time following infection, an interval of 3 months after infection is recommended. This allows for the development of a better immunological response, particularly for 5-17 year olds. Clinical discretion can be applied for those with a higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19 re-infection. This recommendation applies to any dose of the primary course or a booster, for any COVID-19 vaccine currently offered in New Zealand. For more information, see Getting a COVID-19 vaccine if you've had COVID-19 (tinyurl.com/3fmjpew2) and 5.5.8 of Immunisation Handbook (tinyurl.com/3z5hh72v). Non-COVID-19 vaccines after COVID-19 disease All scheduled vaccines can be given as soon as the person has recovered/no longer infectious. This includes Influenza and MMR vaccines.COVID-19 IMMUNISATION CLINICAL TOOLKIT | JULY 2022 (466 863) FOR CLINICAL ADVICE5 IMAC 07/07/2022SECTION 3 | UPDATES AND CLARIFICATION OF VACCINE SCHEDULES (2) SECTION 4 | PRE-VACCINATION (1) IMPORTANT REMINDER In order to gain informed consent from a consumer, the vaccinator must ascertain that the person/ caregiver has received adequate information about the vaccine, including the benefits, the common side effects and the rare but serious adverse events , including anaphylaxis and myocarditis for Comirnaty & Nuvaxovid vaccines, and Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) for Vaxzevria. Offer them an opportunity for questions. Key pre-vaccination screening and guidance documents Adult and Paediatric pre-vaccination screening guidance V15 MMR: Reminder when live vaccines may be contraindicated: Immunocompromised Blood products in the last 12 months Pregnancy History of previous anaphylaxis to the vaccine Live vaccines are contraindicated for all individuals with T lymphocyte-mediated immunodeficiency, a combined B- and T-lymphocyte deficiency or type 1 interferon receptor (IFNAR1) signaling pathway defects. Many of these individuals will be on immunoglobulin replacement therapy, which provides passive protection against most vaccine-preventable infections. Previous adverse events If you have concerns as to whether someone is safe to receive their second vaccine, to discuss the AEFI, please contact IMAC (0800 466 863).

This can be reduced to 21 days in situations where an earlier interval is important for quicker protection, eg, significant medical issues such as immunosuppression, or if delaying vaccine might cause access issues. Should vaccine doses be adjusted based on consumer's size?No, all vaccines doses are calculated based on age. Comirnaty 10mcg vaccine 5-11 year old criteria are by chronological age of the child's immune system not by the child's weight or size. Can a flu vaccine be given straight after COVID disease?Yes, so long as the patient is well in themselves and afebrile, the flu vaccine can be given. There is no stand down time between COVID-19 disease and the flu vaccine. Can the flu vaccine be given with any other vaccines?Yes. The only exception to this is Fluad Quad with Nuvaxovid as both are adjuvanted vaccines and the recommendation is to wait a minimum of three days between vaccines. When can a child receive their National Schedule vaccines post COVID disease?There is no stand down time between National Schedule vaccines and COVID-19 disease. So long as the child is well and afebrile they can receive their National Schedule immunisations. Help with cold chain What Do You Need? Resource & Guidance To report a cold chain breach 1.
