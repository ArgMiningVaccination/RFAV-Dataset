Naturopathic Doctors are trained to address health in a holistic way, to stimulate the healing power of the body, treat the underlying cause of disease, and advocate for prevention above all else. When treating both acute and chronic conditions, treatments are chosen based on the individual patient - their physiological, structural, psychological, social, spiritual, environment and lifestyle factors..

Naturopathic Modalities for Holistic Healing Clinical Nutrition & Diet Nutrition and the therapeutic use of food is a cornerstone of naturopathic medicine. Food can have beneficial or deleterious effects on your health; naturopathic doctors are trained to manage the amount and quality of nutrients in a patient's diet creating the best foundation for health. Nutrition as medicine is an ideal place to begin your journey to optimal health, and may include diet plans and supplements. Botanical/Herbal Medicine Using medicinal properties of plants for their healing and nutritional value. This may include the use of teas, tinctures, salves, ointments and supplements. Naturopathic doctors are currently the only health care providers in Canada to be regulated for the use of botanical medicine. Prevention & Lifestyle Counselling Providing support, and enabling patients to make educated choices in order to build and maintain health on all levels; mental, physical, social and spiritual. Naturopathic doctors are trained to counsel on diet, lifestyle, specific stressors, exercise regimes, and occupational or environmental hazards - this is an integral part of the naturopathic approach to treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine Based on the principle of balancing energy or Qi (chi) that is flowing within meridian pathways of the body, just below the skin. TCM is the use of acupuncture, herbs and diet therapy to treat different conditions and imbalances within the body. Acupuncture works by manipulating fine, solid needles that have been inserted into select points within meridians based on your individual need. Acupuncture has been around for over two thousand years, and has proven to be very effective in a variety of health concerns.
