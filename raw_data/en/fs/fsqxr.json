EVA WHITMORE Dr. Eva Whitmore is a chiropractor at Balance Chiropractic Health Center located in Oakland and Sonoma, CA. She began her training as a medical student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. During this time, she experienced chronic back pain as a result of a childhood injury. While in search of medical treatment, Dr. Whitmore found a chiropractor who utilized applied kinesiology. Chiropractic care had previously been unsuccessful, however, she saw positive results within three visits with this particular chiropractor. RESULTS & SUCCESS STORIES Chronic Pain When I first met Dr. Whitmore, my unexplainable chronic pain was at its height. I could barely hold the steering wheel on my drive over to her office. After my sessions, the relief was significant. Together, over the past couple of years, we have been able to get to the bottom of the pain problems, correct them, and have resumed my normal lifestyle. I whole heartily recommend Dr. Eva Whitmore in every capacity. She is extremely welcoming, talented, and knowledgeable in her field. Without her, who knows if I ever would have had a pain-free day again. -Michelle K.
