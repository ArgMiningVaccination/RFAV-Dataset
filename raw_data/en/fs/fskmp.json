What would happen if there was another spike in cases or a more serious variant emerged? Duke officials are continuing to closely monitor global and local data and trends. Should any new variants or novel viruses emerge that may create a public health risk for our community, we may need to reinstitute certain protocols, including masking and required vaccination. 2. Why not require a COVID vaccine if it would help prevent illness? Mandates for vaccination were required early in the pandemic as a public health measure when immunity was low and severe illness was more widespread. Today, immunity in the population has increased to about 95 percent through vaccination or natural immunity and severe illness has declined significantly. While Duke strongly recommends individuals get up-to-date vaccinations to protect themselves against COVID-19, especially those who may have conditions that place them at higher risk, a mandate is no longer required for public health purposes. 3. Was this decision influenced by any concern about the vaccines or political pushback? Similar to all decisions related to COVID safety protocols, the decision to end the vaccine mandate was based on close assessment of Duke's own data and trends, as well as the data and trends from local, state, national and global sources. We are fortunate to have infectious disease and biomedical research experts at Duke who have worked closely with our chief clinical directors in Student Health and Employee Occupational Health & Wellness to review and assess data and trends throughout the pandemic. The vaccines are safe and effective, and they are strongly recommended as the best way to protect yourself against COVID-19, but the mandate is no longer necessary as a public health measure. 4. How might these changes affect our immunocompromised faculty, staff, and students? Updated vaccination and boosters are strongly recommended for immunocompromised individuals and those at higher risk for severe illness. The risks for most health individuals has now declined significantly based on the increased immunity in the population and a decline in severity of illness. To date, new variants have continued to become less severe and more contagious as part of the viral evolution to out-compete other strains. The XBB variant that is now predominant has followed the same course. Those who may want additional protection can also continue masking to lower their risk for infection. 5. What are the experts suggesting for what the future holds for vaccines? An advisory committee for the FDA has recommended an annual vaccine similar to influenza where experts develop a formula based on projected strains that gets distributed in the fall/winter. The FDA and CDC have not adopted that recommendation yet. If an annual vaccine is approved and becomes available, Duke will plan to offer it to students, faculty and staff. 6. What impact will ending the vaccine mandate have for prospective students considering Duke? Duke still strongly recommends all current and incoming students get up-to-date vaccinations to protect themselves against COVID, especially students who may be at higher risk, but it will no longer be required "}
