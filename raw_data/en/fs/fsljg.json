I sincerely hope that parents of children with autism-spectrum disorders apply the appropriate degree of skepticism and caution to the latest possible explanation for this most maddening of diseases. The absence of a convincing explanation for the recent increase in children diagnosed with autism must be exasperating -- witness the willingness to embrace and cling to the discredited theory that vaccines containing mercury are the culprit. This new suspicion is little more than that, however, and it may prove just as wrong. The theory, propounded by psychiatrist John Cannell is that pregnant women and kids aren't getting enough Vitamin D, which is generated by exposure to sunlight. From [today's Globe and Mail](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070706.wlautism06/BNStory/specialScienceandHealth/home): Dr. Cannell says some of the strongest evidence vitamin D may have a hand in the disorder is that the vitamin is converted in the body to a steroid hormone, which in animal experimentation has been found to influence brain development. If vitamin levels are low, whatever brain development it is linked to will be skewed. Unfortunately, that's about all we have in the way of a theory so far. Studies exploring changes in sunlight exposure over time and autism diagnoses haven't been done. Neither has a study comparing autism and latitude. Maybe there is a link. But the way this idea is evolving and propagating isn't going to help make the case. Although Dr. Cannell is something of a maverick in research circles, he has credentials. Last year, he published an important peer-reviewed paper linking low vitamin D levels to an increased susceptibility to influenza, based on research at his hospital. But for his autism hypothesis, he is now jeopardizing his chances of publication in a scientific journal by e-mailing the Vitamin D Council newsletter outlining the idea to thousands of U.S. autism activists - a possible violation of the rules of publication. Dr. Cannell said he decided to disseminate his hypothesis now to encourage the public to increase its sun exposure during the warmer part of the year. \"If only 10 pregnant women go outside and sunbathe a little bit, they may be saved a lifetime of misery,\" he said. Maybe. But what about the consequences of planting yet another abortive seed of hope in the minds of parents desperate to find a reason for the incredible hardship that is autism? Whatever happened to the peer-review process? Vitamin D is being touted, by Cannell and others, as something of a miracle molecule these days. Just last month, it was [a cancer cure of sorts](http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2007/04/cancer_its_all_about_vitamin_d.php). It may yet turn out to be even more important than many optimists hope. I would have no objection to taking a Vitamin D pill every morning if it helps stave off cancer, autism or the heebie jeebies. But the V [itamin D Council's gushing endorsement](http://www.vitamindcouncil.com/health/autism/vit-D-theory-autism.shtml) of this explanation du jour is premature, even if it does go on to point out that it's still a theory: In addition to the current epidemic of vitamin D deficiency, say another epidemic--an epidemic of autism--was upon our children? What if the autism epidemic began at the same time the epidemic of vitamin D deficiency began? What if both epidemics had worsened in unison? What if one theory explained all the unexplained facts about autism? What if both epidemics had the same root cause: sun avoidance? What if both were iatrogenic, that is, medical advice to avoid the sun had caused both epidemics? Of course, it's probably not a bad idea for most people to spend more time outdoors (instead of blogging, for example), and I have no objection to advising people to do just that. Dermatologists needlessly scared many people inside in the past few decades by overstating the threat of skin cancer from a few minutes in the sun (as opposing to pathological tanning). But again, it would seem reasonable to proceed with caution, considering how irrationally some autism support groups collectively react to shoddy and incomplete science.
