The Company's Community Benefits Program is part of its ongoing commitment to promote the health of Massachusetts residents and streng then the communities where they live. Through the investment of resources \u2014time, talent, and financial \u2014Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts demonstrates its values and commitment to be a thoughtful and effective corporate citizen. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts is proud to play a vital role in improving the health of communities across the Commonwealth. Both in its core business and through ongoing community investments, the success of the Company is grounded in innovation and collaboration. There are no simple solutions to the challenges of health care. This is true especially for children and families in the most vulnerable communities, where health outcomes are tied to a complex mix of education, poverty, and the physical environment. Tackling these complicated community health challenges requires new approaches that address the social and health inequities that ultimately affect everyone , as well as partners hips with community organizations across the state to find long -term solutions that advance healthy living. The mission of the Community Benefits Program focuses on collaborating with public and private stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions that benef it vulnerable and low -income individuals and families in the Commonwealth by addressing social determinants of health and the impact they have on health behaviors and health outcomes , with a particular concentration on the interconnectedness of healthy eat ing, physical activity and healthy environments . Based on a comprehensive review of community health needs assessments, the Company is beginning to focus its work on upstream factors affecting individual and community health as well as continuing its work on the most prevalent health behavior and outcome issues: chronic disease , behavioral health /substance use disorder , and access to health care . This mission is acc omplished through efforts at both the Company and the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation ( the Foundation).

Audrey Shelto (ex -officio), President, Blue Cross Blue Shiel d of Massachusetts Foundation COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts works in partnership with, and seeks input from, a wide range of organizations across the state, as well as national experts. This collaboration assesses community health needs and helps inform how the Company can make a robust and valued contribution to the needs of the Massachusetts community. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT To verify and hone its approach to community health, the Company engaged with a public health consulting firm, Health Resources in Action (HRiA), to conduct a review of Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) across the Commonwealth from 2017 - 2020 . Given that the Company serves the breadth of Massachusetts, assessments from across the Commonwealth were reviewed to g ain a broad cross -section al view of community 2 The Corporate Contributions Committee of the Board, formed in 2011, presently consists of three members of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Board of Directors. 3 As of July 2020 3 health needs. See Key Planning Documents for a sample of these CHNAs (details on the geogra phic scope, year of completion, priority populations, and priority health needs identified in each CHNA ) and any accompanying community health improvement plan or implementation strategy . In addition to the findings of the Company's CHNA review, Appendix A includes additional data points and sources that highlight the importance of focusing on social determinants of health - the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. In the review of ten CHNAs (completed between 2018 and 2019) , one Statewide Health Assessment (completed in 2017) and supporting research studies , there were several common themes and priority needs identified that align with and guide the work of the Company. The top three priority needs identified across these assess ments were chronic disease, behavioral health, and access to h ealth care. Several assessments also identified substance use and housing as priority areas. While not all assessments named priority populations, the most common were youth, older adults, and low-income or homeless individuals . Additionally, in a review of the corresponding and available six Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs), the most common priority areas were mental or behavioral health, substance use, and access to h ealth care. These priority needs and areas for implementation align with the three areas of work that the Company has focused on for its 2019 comm unity benefits programming; namely, chronic disease, behavioral health /substance use disorder , and access to health care. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts reassesses its corporate citizenship approach and impact on an ongoing basis. Below is a history of how the Company's priorities and implementation strategy have evolved. 2014: Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts partnered with a third -party consultant that specializes in integrating corporate citizenship, business and marketing disciplines to impact society, and undertook a strategic planning process to redefine its co rporate citizenship strategy and better align with the Company's mission - the relentless pursuit of quality, affordable health care with an unparalleled consumer experience. A major driver of the process was to understand how the Company can prioritize it s corporate citizenship work to have the greatest possible impact. The consultant conducted in -depth interviews with representatives of leading community organizations to better understand success models, as well as needs/gaps, regarding programs that prom ote the health and wellness of vulnerable populations with unmet needs in their service areas. Issue -based research included: Massachusetts specific health and environmental data and trends; select not -for-profit partner data, perspective and approach; nat ional health -related consumer initiatives, campaigns and benchmarks; specific healthy living definitions, data and trends within national organizations such as The American Heart Association, Center for Disease and Control, National Recreation Park Associa tion, among others; and a news scan of trends and expert voices within the \"healthy living\" dialogue. The result was a refreshed vision to help people across the Commonwealth thrive as healthy and engaged citizens and to create measurable and sustainable i mpact on three pillars of Healthy Living: Healthy Eating, Healthy Active Lifestyles and Healthy Environments. 2015: The Company continued to partner with a third -party consultant to create a framework that would bring the Company's Healthy Living Strategy to life and drive meaningful impact. Along with corporate citizenship staff, the consultant developed an activation plan to focus and guide the strategy, including defining Healthy Eating, Healthy Active Lifestyles , and Healthy Environments; developing a signature initiative; and setting long - and short -term goals that demonstrate social impact. In May, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts formally introduced the Healthy Living strategy at its fifth annual Community Partner Reception. Nearly 200 communi ty leaders attended and provided feedback on the new focus. In November, the Company reconvened approximately 200 community partners at a stakeholder meeting to formally address and inform the new priorities, framework and strategies. 2016: The Company continued to refine the framework, messaging and implementation of the Healthy Living Strategy based on community partner input. Through the help of the Company's community partners, the following belief statements were developed: o We believe all Ma ssachusetts residents should have access to the environments, experiences and education that enable them to live healthy lifestyles. 4 o We believe that by addressing the inter -connectedness of healthy eating, active lifestyles and positive environments, we ca n influence behavior change. o We believe the programs and places that inspire a balanced diet and regular exercise are essential to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. o We believe that positive places and environments are important influencers in improving health. o We believe it is critical to bring diverse stakeholders together to share and learn from one another. o We believe in supporting, testing and scaling fresh, new ideas. o We believe that local communities and experts can be a genesis of fresh ideas and innovation. Moreover , the Company's Healthy Living vision and mission was further refined: for all Massachusetts residents to lead healthy lives through a holistic approach to health and to help Massachusetts residents maintain a healthy lifesty le by increasing access to positive environments and experiences that inspire healthy eating and exercise, respectively. Since 2017, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts has executed on its Healthy Living Strategy . The Company designed and adapted a three -prong strategy : fast -tracking innovative programs; convening leaders and sharing ideas to drive change; and supporting healthy living programs through financial investments and volunteer support . The Healthy Livin g Strategy engages leading not -for-profits in collaborative initiatives and facilitates a network to advance innovative ideas and models that provide underserved families with access to experiences that enable them to lead healthy lives. The three -part strategy includes4: o Healthy Living Accelerator: Accelerates advances in healthy living through a dual -track program. All participants receive funding, training and facilitating, pro -bono support and networking opportunities. o Healthy Living in Action: Levera ges financial investments and volunteer resources to support organizations that are focused on healthy living including: volunteer support from employees including Service Day, skills -based volunteering and BlueCrew projects; investments in not -for- profits to support healthy living programming; strategic collaboration with towns across the state focused on addressing unique community health challenges; internal sustainability and wellness efforts . o Healthy Living Thought Leadership: Drives change by convening stakeholders and sharing insights and promising practices around healthy living innovation . Based on both the Company and the Foundation's complementary outreach , assessment and evaluation efforts, the Company reaffirm s that through the lens of the social determinants of health, chronic disease, behavioral health /substance use disorder , and access to health care should all remain priority issues for its Community Benefits Program . In addition, employee volunteerism ; diversity, equity and inclusion ; and sustainability and environmental health serve as internal levers/ tactics to carry out the Healthy Living Strategy . COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts interacts with more than 500 not -for-profit organizations serving communities across Massachusetts through its Corporate Citizenship program and Foundation in order to support the efforts of individuals and communities to live healthier lives . The Company engages key business, community and civic leaders to help identify needs and develop shared goals. In 201 9, the Corporate Citizenship department actively engage d with community partners and participate d in best practice forums to ensure priorities are current and meeting the needs of the community. Additionally, the Corporate Citizenship staff convenes community partners on an annual basis, as well as meets with their portfolio of grantees either in person, on the phone , or via site visits to understand and reassess the organization's needs on both funding and civic engagement levels. These meetings provide the Company with the opportunity to regularly gather important information about the needs of t he populations served and better 4 Refe r to Appendix B for detailed Healthy Living Strategy . 5 understand each organization's evaluation metrics, as well as provide feedback and ideas about the potential applicants' funding proposals. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts continues to share and garner best practic es among its peers regarding critical social issues impacting Massachusetts communities. Accordingly, the Company is a member of several global, national, and regional corporate social responsibility industry groups . The Boston College Center for Corporat e Citizenship is a global, membership -based knowledge center. Founded in 1985, the Center has a history of leadership in corporate citizenship research and education. They engage a network of more than 470 member companies annually to share knowledge and e xpertise about the practice of corporate citizenship through the Center's professional development programs, online community, regional programs, and annual conference. The Vice President of Corporate Citizenship and Public Affairs serves as a member of th e Executive Forum for the Center, representing the Blue Plans. Nationally, the Community Investments & Partnership Workgroup of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, gathers corporate social responsibility colleagues across the country to share best pra ctices, discuss national visibility and partnership opportunities , and establish national metrics as they relate to Blue System -wide community engagement. The Vice President of Corporate Citizenship and Public Affairs and the Director of Community Investments and Business Integration are members of this workgroup. On a local level, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts is an active member of the Greater Boston Givers Group, Metro West Givers Group, and the Corporate Volunteer Council. These volunteer groups of regional corporate citizenship professionals in the busines s community meet on a monthly basis to discuss social issues that have an impact on the communities they serve and the not -for-profit organizations making measurable impact in these areas. Together, the groups are better able to understand where funding ga ps and civic engagement opportunities may exist. The Manager of Signature Programs and Civic Leadership Development serve d on the Leadership Committee of the Corporate Volunteer Council in 2019 . The Company partners with the Massachusetts Non -Profit Netwo rk (MNN), which has more than 700 not - for-profit members across the state with a vast range of sizes, missions, and budgets. The MNN is the voice of the not -for-profit sector, bringing together not -for-profits, funders, community and business leaders, and elected officials to strengthen not -for-profits and raise their voice on critical issues. MNN understands that strong not -for-profits build strong communities. The Company is proud to work with MNN to strengthen the not -for-profit community of the Commonwe alth. The Company has several different funding strategies throughout the year. The first is on a rolling and on -going basis. The funding guidelines, which are widely distributed and made available via the Company's website , provide specific instructions for applying for support. All requests are carefully considered on a bi -weekly basis by an internal Corporate Contributions Committee, comprised of leaders representing dive rse business perspectives. The Committee helps to determine, or provides recommendations for funding decisions, which are driven by community need. Organizations seeking funding are encouraged to speak with Corporate Citizenship staff to get a complete und erstanding of the Company's Community Investment Program. A second process is through the active solicitation of requests for programmatic funding at predetermined times of the year. All opportunities for new applicants to seek support are announced publi cly. Grant guidelines - which are widely distributed via direct email and across convening organizations such as Philanthropy Massachusetts, Massachusetts Nonprofit Network, United Ways, and others - explain the impact the Company seeks to generate with th e funding and provide specific instructions for applying. Applications undergo multiple levels of Corporate Citizenship staff reviews and input from select subject matter experts across the Company. Applicants are encouraged to speak with Corporate Citizen ship staff as they prepare their proposals to ensure they have a complete understanding of the funding opportunity they are pursuing. As such, Corporate Citizenship staff can provide preliminary feedback and ideas about the applicant's project. All Company grant programs include rigorous evaluation and shared learning components that provide valuable information to both grantees and program staff and ensures that the community investments are in line with the Company's Healthy Living Strategy. 6 Similarly, the majority of the Foundation's grants are offered through program areas that are in direct alignment with the Foundation's strategic priorities (which also align with the Company's Community Benefits Program priorities) within coverage and care, behavior al health and social equity and health. The grants are issued during specific grant cycles each year. The Foundation publicly announces all opportunities for new applicants to seek support. The grant guidelines, which are widely distributed and made avail able via the Foundation's website , explain the impact the Foundation seeks to generate with the funding and provide specific instructions for applying for grants. Once requests are received, they underg o up to two levels of staff review and then two levels of Board review before grants are awarded. Applicants are encouraged to speak with Foundation staff as they prepare their proposals to ensure they have a complete understanding of the funding opportuni ty they are pursuing. As such, Foundation staff can provide preliminary feedback and ideas about the applicant's project. All Foundation grant programs include rigorous evaluation and shared learning components that provide valuable information to both gr antees and program staff and ensures that the community investments are in - line with the Foundation's mission. Another funding mechanism is used specifically for smaller capacity -building mini -grants offered by the Catalyst Fund. The Catalyst Fund provide s one -year, non -renewable grants to help community -based health care organizations strengthen their capacity to expand access to health care in Massachusetts. These grants are funded by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts employee contributions. In 20 19, the Company matched all employee donations. The application process for the Catalyst Fund is conducted on a rolling basis and applications are reviewed monthly. While administered by the Foundation, applications are reviewed and determined by a 13 -memb er Committee comprised of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts employees. One hundred percent of the donations made to the Catalyst Fund are used for grants to not -for-profit organizations with no funds used for the Foundation's administrative costs. Information about Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts' Community Benefits and Corporate Citizenship Programs, which include the work of the Foundation , are made available via the Company's website . Both the Company and the Foundation widely distribute and publicize annual reports. The Company's annual report includes a separate and robust Corporate Citizenship section. COMMUNITY BE NEFITS PROGRAM AND ACTIVITIES Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts' Community Benefits Program is part of an ongoing commitment to the community that extends beyond a one -year timeframe. In 2019 , the Company invested $8. 1 million towards the programmin g, operations and infrastructure of nearly 480 not-for-profit community organizations providing critical social services to families facing economic hardship throughout the Commonwealth. These significant investments targeted areas of healthy eating, healt hy active lifestyles and healthy environments. In addition, the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation awarded $3.8 million in grants to 80 community -based organizations, health centers, and hospital -based programs that focused on behavioral he alth, coverage & care, and social equity & health. See Appendix C for a breakdown of the Company's community benefits support, and Appendix D for the Foundation's grant programs. Collectively, $ 11.2 million was in direct support of the Community Benefits Program impact areas . The following is a description of the Company's 2019 community benefits activities: CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION Social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life . These social determinants have increasingly been understood to fundamentally affect health behaviors and outcomes. Vulnerable populations , who have l ess 7 access to nutritious foods, exercise , and healthy environments than their more affluent counterparts , are consequently at increased risk for chronic disease outcomes such as diabetes, ob esity and heart disease .5 As such, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts has created and widely shared a framework and plan that define s its Healthy Living Strategy and its three pillars : Healthy Eating, Healthy Active Lifestyles , and Healthy Environments . To realize the vision embodied in this strategy, the Company designed a Healthy Living Accelerator that engages leading not -for-profits in collaborative initiatives and facilitates a network to advance innovative ideas and models that provide underserved families with access to experiences that enable them to lead healthy lives. Key accomplishments over the past year are described below. Healthy Living Accelerator In 2019, the Company introduced the Healthy Living Accelerator Grants program that awarded $500,000 to five not-for-profits to launch a new program or scale an existing model that improves access to nutritious meals, fitness opportunities , and healthy environments for communi ties across Massachusetts. In addition to financial support, the Company provide d ongoing skill -building and pro -bono support to help these organizations successfully carry out their initiatives . Food for Free , Family Meals : This innovative program t urns prepared food from corporate, university, and hospital dining services into attractive, balanced, single -serving meals to reach food -insecure students at local community colleges , as well as high school students in crisis. By pack aging rescued food into ready - to-eat meals, Family Meals makes it possible to distribute a category of food that is otherwise difficult to utilize while reaching populations like college students, who are not well served by traditional food programs. Collaborative for Educational Services, Healthy Food Where You Live: The mobile farmers ' market model is reach ing food desert communities in Amherst and 12 other Western Massachusetts communities . The program brings produce from local farms to communities with limited access to grocery stores and allows low-income residents to receive significant financial relief under the SNAP (food stamps) incentive program. The program also incorporates a refer ral mechanism through a partnership with the Hilltown Community Health Center , linking patients at risk for chronic disease to the farmers' market. Data from a market pilot in 2018 demonstrated that 67% of participating r esidents felt more confident in their ability to meet their daily food needs, 44% reported feeling healthier, and 94% reported eating fresh produce four or more times per week as a result of the market. Massachusetts Farm to School , Breakfast after the Bell : The pilot schoo l breakfast model in the Salem and Webster school districts aims to increase student participation in the state -mandated Breakfast After the Bell program and upgrad e the nutritional value of the food served at school . Students receive high -quality , scratch -cooked meals featuring local products that are cost effective for the schools. Results from the pilot will be used to inform refinements to the model and create a toolkit that can be shared with schools across the state . Old Colony YMCA , Y on the Fly: The mobile activity van brings the YMCA's traditional opportunities for learning, physical activity, and healthy eating into the Brockton, Stoughton, and Taunton communities where there is limited access to safe recreation. Children, youth, and their families have access to 6 0 minutes of physical activity following the YMCA's evidence -based CATCH (Coordinated Approach to Child Health) model, followed by 30 minutes of nutrition education which includes preparing a healthy snack at no cost. Resources are also be available to con nect families to nutritional support, like SNAP or WIC and local farmers' markets. 5 Shaw KM, Theis KA, Self -Brown S, Roblin DW, Barker L . 2013.

Prev Chronic Dis 2016;13:160088. from: https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2016/16_0088.htm ). 8 East Boston Air Partners , Air Proofing in East Boston : The collaborative program works to improve air quality in East Boston , a community that, due to busy roadways and its proximity to Logan Airport, experiences among the highest concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFPs) in the entire Boston Metro area. In partnership with East Boston Social Service s, Olin College and Air, In c., the project raises awareness about the sources and impacts of UFPs and other pollutants and equips residents with access to strategies for reducing their exposure , including a mobile and web -based air quality app and a filter subsidy program for classr ooms and at -risk households. In addition to the Network and Grants program, the Company facilitates a Collaborative program as part of its Healthy Living Accelerator. Its first collaborative, Dot Rx, is a \"prescription for healthy living\" program available to Dorchester residents receiving care at Codman Square Health Center. With a Dot Rx prescription from their clinician, families can connect to a peer coach and take advantage of no - or low -cost experiences that promote healthier lives, including opportunities to eat healthy, get outside, and be active. In addition to the health center, key partners include Union Capital Boston, Daily Table, Healthworks Community Fitness, Outdoors Rx : a program of the Appalachian Mountain Club, and the YMCA of Gre ater Boston. By the end of 2019, Codman Square clinicians had written more than 525 Dot Rx prescriptions for their patients, and 153 participating families had been connected to peer coaches. To further strengthen this valuable community resource , Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts provided the Heath Center with a multi -year grant to hire a full -time program manager to take over all day -to-day responsibilities. The success of the Dot Rx program led the Company to begin collaborations in 2019 with the East Boston Neighborhood Health Cen ter (EBNHC) to support their patient referral program and the development of a community resource and wellness center. The center will be a one -stop -shop for wellness and a shared space for organizations to connect an d serve East Boston community members. The Company has committed to 250 hours of pro -bono consulting around community partner collaboration and program development and will help fund the cost of reduced or free healthy programming available for its members. In January 20 20, the Company facilitated the East Boston Service Provider Summit in which 40+ organizational representatives from East Boston came together to share plans and collaborate on opportunities for the center opening in 2020. In addit ion to the Healthy Living Accelerator Program, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts supports a variety of organizations and projects across the state that address the three pillars of its Healthy Living Strategy: Healthy Eating , Healthy Active Lifestyles , and Healthy Environments . This Healthy Living Strategy was carefully designed to help underserved families across Massachusetts prevent risk of chronic disease. The Company does this through funding, pro -bono expertise, and volunteerism. Healthy Eating For good health, it is essential to maintain a balanced diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, protein, whole grains, and dairy . Yet for too many Commonwealth residents this is a daily challeng e as they face barriers such as lack of access to healthy food, cost, and lack of knowledge about how to prepare healthy foods. In 2019, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts addresse d these barriers and support ed healthy eating through initiatives directed toward food insecurity, youth develo pmen t, and supplemental programs for low -income residents. One in ten residents in Massachusetts is food insecure , according to America's Health Rankings for 2019.6 The Company supports a variety of initiatives that address food insecurity across the state: o In collaboration with Project Bread, Massachusetts' statewide anti -hunger organization, and the American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts , the Company developed a unique partner ship to address food security among students in 12 Massachusetts communities (Amherst, Boston, Chicopee, Fall River, Lowell, Lawrence, Pittsfield, Salem, Saugus, Springfield, Webster, and Worcester) . Funding has enabled Project Bread to provide tec hnical assistance and grant writing support to school districts so they can access federal funding for food programs and has also supported the 6 United Health Foundation, American's Health Rankings. (2019). 2019 Health of Women and Children (Retrieved from: https://www.americash ealthrankings.org/learn/reports/2019 -health -of-women -and-children -report ) 9 work of Teacher Champions in each community through grant funding and statewide recognition. This work complimen ts the Company 's existing support of the Massachusetts Farm to School program. o The Springfield Schools Backpack Program seeks to a ddress food insecurity for disadvantaged families in Springfiel d. Each Friday, 300 backpacks filled with a balanced array of food are deployed across the city to supplement weekend meals for children, a great need in a school district that has one of the highest percentages of economically disadvantaged students in the state. o The Company supported the Boston Area Gleaners' Surplus Commodity Crop Program, which addresses the dual, interrelated challenges of pervasive hunger and food waste across the region. By working closely with farmers and volunteer laborers, Boston Area Gleaners bridges a critical gap in the food system by connecting more than 500 hunger -relief programs across eastern Massachusetts to fresh, high -quality produce that wou ld otherwise be plowed under. The program is designed to reduce large -scale farm level crop food waste and improve community health by providing a reliable economic incentive for farmers to move their crop to local no t-for-profits. In turn, the program add resse s both regional food insecurity and new economic development while recuperating the costs of growing the crops. Youth can play a critical role in supporting local food infrastructures while at the same time gaining valuable knowledge about where their food comes from and skills that can help current food economies and future youth employment. The Company supported several of these efforts in 2019 : o The Company supported GreenRoots, a resident -led not-for-profit in Chelsea , address ing food insecurity while building social cohesion . Support from the Company helped to expand its Urban Farming Program, engage urban youth in food production, and establish distribution networks to ensure produce is provided to the most vulnerable. Company funding enabled GreenRoots to purchase critical infrastructure pieces to allow storage and delivery of produce as well as hire and train a Youth Farm Crew, wh ich focus es on food production, community outreach , and peer training, with hopes of building a new pipeline of young urban farmers. o The Company partnered with Roots Rising, a community -based organization whose mission is to empower youth and build community through food and farming . Company support allowed Pittsfield youth to work on farms, in food pantries, and at the Pittsfield Farmers ' Market , which also include chef demonstrations for the community . These Youth Crews provide d opportunities for paid employment and the ability to engage in meaningful work, leaving youth feeling purposeful, capable , and connected. In 2019, 43 Pittsfield teens were engaged in strengthenin g the local food system. o The Company supported t he Field to Fork Program , a partnership between the Chicopee Schools and the Franklin County Community Development Corporation (FCCDC) , that provides yearly farm field trips for 4th grade students in the district to learn about local agriculture and form connections that will change the way they think about the food on their trays. Additionally, FCCDC uses local produce to create new products for the K -12 food service market, which w ill help eliminate some of the barriers that prevent districts from participating in farm to school and provide a financial boost to the local food economy. The Company also support ed increasing access to healthy food for lower income residents by funding programs that supplement local resources: o The Company supported Market Match at the Pittsfield Farmers Market which provide d Berkshire County residents with access to fresh, healthy, and locally -produced foods throughout the year. The market, which accepts SNAP, WIC, and senior food benefits, is designed to promote healthy living and foster community building. 10 o The Company collaborated with the Amherst Farmers' Market to host a Health y Living Match program which supported low-income shoppers through allow ing those who qualify for SNAP, EBT and HIP benefits to receive an additional allotment of match dollars that will allow them to purchase produce, meats, eggs and other goods from market vendors. Additionally, funding supporte d increased outreach to the Amher st community, particularly among local college and university students and staff, and programming for marketgoers about cooking local, healthy food. This is the first time in the Amherst Farmer's Market's 45 -year history that it has collaborated with a cor porate partner. The Company also launched an innovative corporate partnership with Community Servings to provide medically tailored meals to seniors with congestive heart failure after they have been discharged from the hospital. Each week 10 made -from -scratch meals plus snacks and milk were delivered to program participants. Meal selections were reviewed by a registered dietician to ensure that they are heart healthy, low in sodium and fat. Blue Cros s Blue Shield of Massachusetts case managers periodically checked in with participants by phone to monitor the impact of the program and determine if medically tailored meals would benefit those who suffer from other chronic conditions. Healthy Active Lifestyles Recognizing the importance of physi cal activity to overall health while also acknowledging the many barriers to regular engagement (time constraints, motivation, lack of access, and the pull of technology among them) , Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts ' approach to supporting fitness has been to partner with organizations who address barriers and provide programs that reach unde rserved populations while also sponsoring free and fun community -based fitness activities. In response to the growing body of research suggesting that students do better academically and socially when they have engaged in physical activity7, in 2019 the Company support ed two programs that get students moving : o Playworks New England is a not -for-profit that leverages recess to increase physical activity and improve school climate by deploying well-trained, full -time program coaches into low -income schools to become part of the community through play , which helps children to develop important social and emotional skills like respect, leadership, communication and conflict resolution. According to a survey of educators at schools participating in Playworks, 98% report ed students are better able to focus, 95% report ed improved overall school climate, and 83% report ed fewer bullying incidents during recess. The Company's partnership with Playworks i n 2019 was multifaceted and include d a financial investment, the company -wide annual Service Day , junior coach mentors , and bi-monthly volunteer recess at the Orchard Garden s School in Boston. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts ' Chief Communications and Citizenship Officer serves as the Chair of the regional Board of Directors. o Build Our Kids Success (BOKS) , is a free, before -school physical activity and nutrition program designed to get children moving in the morning and get their brains ready for a day of learning. Backed by science, BOKS provides each school community with a curriculum, training and on -going support to establish and maintain programming . There is no cost to the school or parents. Beginning in early 2019 and into the 2019 -2020 school year , the Company supported expanded programming to 250 kids in five Attleboro public schools. Because these scho ol districts cannot support BOKS' parent -volunteer model, the Company partnered with BOKS to provide grants to fund stipends for two trainers per school as well as program equipment. The Company's Vice President of Corporate Citizenship and Public Affairs is a member of the BOKS advisory board. 7 Contemporary Clinical Trials. 2016.

The program doubled the number of partners compared to last year and added new program offerings. In 2019, nearly 3,700 people participated, with an average of 40 per class. o The City of Lowell k icked off Lowell's Fitness in the Park series in summer 2019, which was part of a multi -faceted, multi -year Healthy Living partnership with the Company . This series began with a celebratory event in the newly renovated Kerouac Park offering free yoga, CrossFit, and Zumba. o In partnership with the City of Worcester, the Department of Health & Human Services and the Worcester YMCA , the Company was a presenting sponsor of the Worcester Parks Summer Fitness Series. The 17 -week program provided free outdoor fitness classes in 10 parks across the city of Worcester, expanding the Company's reach to provide exercise opportunities across the state. Classes ranged from tai chi to dance fitness to boot camp, with offerings in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French. o As the exclusive sponsor, the Company collaborated with the Trustee s of Reservations for their Hike125 initiative which challenged Massachusetts residents t o hike 125 miles from April through December. The Company collaborated with the Trustee s of Reservations to actively promote their network of 116 parklands as a part of a healthy and active lifestyle. Launched in 2016, the program attracts close to 1,500 each year who conduct more than 5,000 hikes covering well over 10,000 miles at Trustee s properties across the state. Healthy Environments Natural or built, healthy environments play a significant role in well -being. Poor quality housing, air, and water are social factors that can contribute to increased incidence of disease including childhood asthma, COPD, autism, neurological diseases, and some cancers9. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts is working to promote healthy environments through a variety of initiatives . In 2019, the Company continued its efforts to make healthier and environmentally safe transportation options accessible to communities as lead sponsor for two independent public bike -share systems: o Continuing its partnership with the City of Salem, the Company funded an expansion of the Sa lem Bike Share Program, by increasing the fleet by 30 bikes and adding six new docking stations throughout the city, bringing the total to 80 bikes and 16 docks. The system serves prime locations throughout the city including Salem State University, the Sa lem Ferry Terminal, the popular Salem Willows Park, and the downtown commercial area. Riders have logged nearly 10,000 rides in the program's first two seasons, replacing hundreds of car trips on local roads. o Company support expanded the capacity of B luebikes, a Metro Boston bike-share program in Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Everett and Somerville . In 2019, funding enabled the program to expand to the previously underserved communities of Mattapan, Dorchester, and Roslindale, adding 54 total new station s to the system. This included new locations near community health centers to 9 The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation. 2015. Leveraging the Social Determinants of 13 support increased access to health care. To date, the B luebikes system has logged 2.3 million trips, up 33% from the previous year ; and it has 25,000 active members, 29% year over year growth. The program has provided sustainable alternative transportation methods and reduced single occupancy vehicles from our roadways, consequently reducing our carbon footprint, air pollution, and noise pollution. In celebration of Pride Month in June 2019 , Bluebikes revealed a fleet of 50 Proud Bikes at Boston's Pride Parade . Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts donated $1 to Fenway Health for every ride on a Proud Bike during the month ; combined with a matching donation from Lyft, Fenway Health received $6,929. The Company was the lead sponsor of the One Waterfront initiative, a collaboration to create public spaces along Boston's waterfront led by the Trustee s of Reservations . The initiative seeks to create access for city residents to natural and open land along the harbor where there remains a lack of compelling public spaces and where the decline of the maritime industry, rise in redevelopment pressure, and looming threat of sea level rise create an urgent need for though tful planning and stewardship. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts ' President and Chief Executive Officer is a member of One Waterfront Initiative CEO Roundtable. Working in collaboration with the Lowell Health Department and other city officials, the Company increased access to IMPACT Melanoma 's Practice Safe Skin program for residents and visitors to Lowell by supporting ten automatic sunscreen dispensers around the city as well as a portable unit, promoting sun safety policies throughout the city, a nd providing education about skin cancer prevention to 45 lifeguards, counselors, and recreational staff. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH /SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER Opioid use disorder is a growing epidemic in the country and in the state. According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, there were 1,543 confirmed opioid -related overdose deaths with an estimated additional 437 to 523 deaths in 2019 .10 Opioid misuse is a safety and health care quality issue for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and the community , and the Company has taken an active approach to addressing this epidemic . The Company continued to promote the first -of-its-kind opioid response toolkit to offer potentially lifesaving Narcan and overdose response training in workplaces throughout Massachusetts. Developed through the leadership of Dr. Ken Duckworth, a psychiatrist and behavioral health medical director for the Company, these kits are provided free of charge to companies in industries where the rate of opioid overdos e is the highest, including the construction industry. The Company is also providing employee education and training, including an online opioid resource center that offers information on medication safety, pain management, treatment options and other related information. Partnering with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Company provi des an expert in naloxone administration so the participating employers can train their own in -house trainers. The Company launched a new, $1 million initiative to aid in the growth and standardization of recovery coaches. Recovery coaches are trained p rofessionals, typically with lived experience, who provide peer support to those in treatment and recovery for substance use disorder (SUD). Their services span a wide breadth, from treatment navigation to social re -integration. The Company provided grants to nine organizations for 24 months to support these organizations. Participating organizations were selected through an RFP process, open to Company contracted providers serving a minimum number of members with substance use disorder. Each organization h as a recovery coach program already underway, staffed by trained coaches and supervisors. The organizations will use the funds to share data on Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts members' experiences with recovery coaches, and to support and expand their recovery coach programs overall , which will aid in driving change in the community through shared 10 Massachusetts Department of Public Health. 2020. Data Brief: Opioid -Related Overdose Data from the participating organizations will also help inform potential payment models for this type of support. The Company contin ued to implement the Prescription Pain Medication Safety Program that has successfully reduced the risk of substance use disorder and other potential health issues related to long - term use of opioids. The Prescription Pain Medication Safety Program implements opioid -prescribing best practices that include: a treatment plan between doctor and patient that considers non -narcotic options; a risk assessment for addiction signed by the patient; an opioid agreement between the patient and prescriber outlining expected behavior of both parties; t he identification of a single pharmacy or pharmacy chain to be used for all opioid prescriptions, whe n indicated; and a prior authorization requirement for all new short -acting opioid prescriptions for more than 30 days (two 15 -day fills) and for all new long -acting opioid prescriptions. Over a three -year period, the Company has eliminated an estimated 21.5 million doses of opioid -based medications in the community; reduced claims for short opioid painkillers such \u00ae and percent; reduced claims for long-acting opioids such as OxyContin\u00ae by approximately 50 percent by switching patients to short -acting pain treatments; and stopped more than 62,000 individuals from receiving inappropriate levels of acetaminophen. Additionally, the Company has provided those who receive large amounts of narcotic medications with access to pain management experts and non -narcotic methods of pain control and i mproved care coordination for individuals with pain-management needs, especially for those with more than one prov ider-prescribed medication. The program was used as the model for a Massachusetts law that limits the number of days these medications can be prescribed and to require prescribers to check a database to ensure the patient is not filling prescriptions for the same or similar drugs elsewhere. The Commonwealth was the first state in the nation to pass such a law. The Company is a founding member of RIZE Massachusetts, a state -wide, private sector initiative created to build a $50 million fund founded in response to the opioid overdose crisis in the Commonwealth and is dedicated to expanding access to treatment and other services for opioid use disorder (OUD) through grantmaking, policy and research, and convenings . Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts President and Chief Executive Officer is a member of the RIZE Massachusetts Board of Directors. To date, RIZE has distributed more than $4.9 million in grants to more than 50 Massachusetts organizations to support efforts such as research on stigma in health care professions and effectiveness of recovery coaches, convening stakeholders to discussing stigma in substance use disorders, and supporting collaborative care approaches for community -based opioid use treatment. The Company continued support of Drug Story Theat er (DST) , a not -for-profit organization dedicated to treatment and prevention of adolescent addiction through a peer -to-peer education model that involves improvisational theater. In 2019, the Company supported 20 shows reaching nearly 7,400 people. The Company continued providing pro -bono design support to refresh and cobrand materials, including a redesigned survey, program brochure, and signage for exhibit at District Attorney and wellness conferences. With support from the Company, The Massachusetts Health Policy Forum seeks to convene and present the highest quality of research to stakeholders, legislators, and the public . The Forum was created in 1998 to bring public and private health care leaders together to engage in focused discussion on critical health policy challenges f acing the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Foundation's President , along with the Company's Vice President of Government & Regulatory Affairs , sit on the Board of Directors. In 2019, the Company supported development of an issue brief sponsored by the Massachusetts Health Policy Forum and conducted by researchers at Brandeis University on addressing the opioid crisis in small and rural communities in Western Massachusetts, including an analysis of the problem, its impact, and policy recommendations. Find ings were shared at a forum in September that brought together researchers, providers, and advocates. 15 In recognition of its work, the Company received the prestigious Blue Cross Blue Shield Association Brand Excellence Award for ongoing work to combat the opioid epidemic. The Company was recognized for the groundbreaking programs described above that expand access to care for people with opioid use disorder, engage employers in the prevention of overdoses, and provide educati on and other resources that support people with the disorder through treatment and recovery while reducing the stigma associated with opioid use. The Foundation received a special three -year investment from the Company to support an initiative to develop an online behavioral health resource. The project was developed through a comprehensive stakeholder process across the public and private sectors, in close coordination with the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services and state agenci es. In March 2020, the Foundation - together with funding partners MetroWest Health Foundation and the C.F. Adams Charitable Trust - announced the launc h of Network of Care Massachusetts , a comprehensive online resource to help anyone find behavioral health resources and treatment in their community . About 1 in 5 people in Massachusetts have a mental health or substance use condition, and although these conditions are prevalent, many people struggle to find the services and supports they nee d. The Network of Care Massachusetts website helps consumers and caregivers navigate a complex system by providing information about varied behavioral health resources. It features an extensive library of health information and a directory of 5,000 mental health, substance use and related social service agencies and programs from Boston to the Berkshires. The Foundation released a pivotal report designed to define a new vision for the behavioral health (inclusive of mental health and substance use disorder services) care system in Massachusetts. The report and companion chart pack document describe the current behavioral health care system for children, adolescents, and adults in Massac husetts , outline a new whole -person -oriented vision for behavioral health care in the Commonwealth , and propose a strategic approach and series of recommendations through which the state can advance this vision to achieve reform. This new vision for behavioral health care in Massachusetts addresses some of the most pressing challenges impacting how behavioral health care is delivered today. Among others, these include: barriers to accessing and navigating the behavioral health care continuum, inadequate coverage of behavioral health care services across payers, workforce shortages and capacity issues, unnecessary regulatory burden and redundancy, fragmented administrative and payment functions, and lack of monitoring and accountabil ity for behavioral health outcomes. Recommendations from this report will guide future policy and research projects. The findings were released at an event attended by nearly 300 stakeholders. The Foundation commenced a new grant program Expanding Acces s to Behavioral Health Urgent Care, which builds upon the Commonwealth's existing Emergency Services Program (ESP) system and the potential to increase access to care by expanding the ESPs' ability to provide community -based behavioral health urgent care. At the end of 2018, the Foundation funded six ESPs for an initial planning year to establish a vision for the adult BHUC system and determine appropriate milestones and measures of success for the multi -year implementation grant program. At the end of 201 9, the Foundation funded a three -year grant program for ESPs to build upon their existing models to provide more comprehensive urgent care services for adults, as well as appropriate and timely follow -up care and ongoing treatments. The Foundation's goal i s to support more seamless, expeditious, comprehensive, and effective care for adults with mental health, substance use, and co -occurring needs. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE Many people face barriers that prevent or limit access to needed health care, which may increase the risk of poor health outcomes and health inequities. These barriers include, but are not limited to, availability of health care, transportation to care, culturally and linguistically appropriate care, and health insurance coverage. The following is a sample of the health care access activities and programs that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts supports . In Massachusetts, 52 community health center organizations provide high quality health care to more than 1,000,000 state residents through more than 300 sites statewide. In 2019, t he Company support ed 14 of 16 these community health centers totaling $333,464 in their efforts to address the social determinants of health and provide quality, affordable health care to diverse and underserved communities. Many health center patients are from ethnic and racial minorities a nd are disproportionately affected by chronic diseases such as diabetes, asthma, cancer depression and HIV/AIDS. All health center clinical initiatives are aimed at addressing health disparities, including innovative and highly successful Health Disparitie s Collaboratives (HDCs). In Massachusetts, 39 community health centers currently participate in at least one Health Disparities Collaborative (HDC), applying the Care Model for performance improvement. HDCs help individuals better collaborate with health c are professionals to strengthen and support self -care in the management of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, asthma and heart disease. Patients work with their physicians to set goals and develop action plans that assist them to meet key health objective s related to their chronic illness. Health centers have also been critical in helping people sign up for health insurance through the Marketplace. In 201 9, almost one million Massachusetts residents chose to receive their health care at a community health center, taking advantage of comprehensive, high -quality services available all in one place. Health Care for All is a not -for-profit organization that seeks to make quality, affordable health care accessible to everyone, regardless of income, social or e conomic status. In 2019, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts supported Health Care for All's efforts : o Ensure maximum enrollment in existing coverage programs, successful transition to new coverage programs, and retention of coverage for families and in dividuals . o Ensure that health system reforms reduce cost, improve quality and transparency, and preserve public program eligibility, benefits, and affordability for all consumer s. o Advance and monitor fundamental reforms of the Massachusetts health care payment and delivery system . o Ensure that health care consumers are educated, empowered, and equipped to participate in health reform debates alongside insurers, health care providers, and health coverage purchasers. o The Company was a lead funder of t he Rob Restuccia Health Justice Organizational Fellowship which honors the legacy of Community Catalyst's long-time executive director . This new program seeks to cultivate and equip diverse organizational leaders with the tools and strategies needed to make meaningful gains for health access and affordability. The Fellowship, also known as the Legacy Project, will build the internal organizational development capacity with key local and state groups to expand the influence of health care consumers, and to m ake greater strides toward health justice with the goal to launch the fellowship in the spring of 2020. The Company suppor ted its partners in the business community such as Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM), the Massachusetts Business Roundtable (MBR), and the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce (GBCC) to develop both region -specific and statewide policy priorities to protect Massachusetts employers in the provision of affordable health care coverage to their employees, as they seek to balance quality, access and affordability for the Commonwealth's workforce. The Company partners with organizations representing a wide range of employers to ensure the business community voices of all sizes and types of businesses are heard in the health care debate. The Foundation sponsored several convenings that assembled stakeholders from government, advocacy, academia and the provid er community to discuss health care issues such as the behavioral health service continuum and community -based provider perspectives on health care's entry into social determinants of health, particularly as that relates to MassHealth's flex services progr am. The Foundation hosted a webinar on MassHealth: The Basics, which oriented more than 250 participants to the program, including what benefits MassHealth covers, who it serves, program spending and cost drivers, and a status update on the state's deliver y reform efforts . Grantees participated in learning communities during which they received expert technical assistance and shared best practices with their peers to address common challenges. The Massachusetts Institute for Community Health Leadership (MICHL), supported by the Foundation, continued to engage its 10th cohort of 18 emerging community health leaders from state and local departments of public health, community health centers, mental health centers, advocacy groups, hospitals and academia. MICHL, which began in 2006, is an 18 -day educational program presented over the course of 17 nine months, featuring a curriculum of classroom work, peer -to-peer exchanges, and experiential and collaborative learning. Participants conclude their tenu re by identifying and proposing recommendations to address a health care issue affecting the state's low -income and vulnerable residents. After the 2018 -2019 class concluded their program in June 2019 , the Foundation convened new and former graduates throu gh the Alumni Program. The Alumni program provides workshops and leadership training activities to continue to build the capacity of health leaders in the Commonwealth. Since the MICHL program began in 2006, it has graduated more than 160 leaders. The Foundation produced or supported nine publications on aspects of access to care, including behavioral health and coverage, with a focus on the state's Medicaid program, MassHealth. The Foundation i ssued a report on the geography of uninsurance in Massachusetts, using newly released data from the American Community Survey. The report relied on three measures of uninsurance - uninsurance rate, number of uninsured, and concentration of uninsured - to identify high -uninsurance communities in the state. This brief also provided new information on socioeconomic characteristics of high-uninsurance communities and their uninsured residents to further inform strategies for targeted outreach efforts. By lookin g at the concentration of uninsured residents (i.e., the number of uninsured per square mile of land area) to identify high -uninsurance communities, the report demonstrated that the uninsured are concentrated in a relatively small number of communities, pr imarily in and around Boston. These and other findings from the report were used by the Connector to inform the locations where state outreach and enrollment events were hosted. The Foundation t rained 13 journalists through the Health Coverage Fellowship , which is designed to help newspaper, radio, television, and online reporters and editors do a better job covering critical health care issues. Over a nine -day period, more than 80 speakers participated, including top health officials, policy experts, and researchers. The program also brings its journalists into the field to watch first -hand how the system works, from walking the streets at night with behavioral health case workers to riding along with Boston EMT and paramedic crews. The Company was one of the principal founders of the Massachusetts Coalition on Serious Illness Care (the Coalition) in 2016. The Company continues to be the primary funder of Coalition activities, including funding the staff position for the Executive Director and providing significant in -kind communications, management and convening resources. Led by co -chairs Atul Gawande, surgeon, professor, writer, and public health researcher and Maureen Bisognano, former President and Chief Executive Officer of the Institute for Health Care Improvement, the Coalition consists of more than 110 Massachusetts organizations that are committed to its mission: to ensure that health care for everyone in Massachusetts is in accordance with their goals, values, and preferences at all stages of l ife and in all steps of their care. The coalition established six core priorities to help achieve the mission: o Name a health care proxy: Everyone in Massachusetts, 18 or older, has designated a health care decision -maker (health care proxy). o Engage in ongo ing conversations with the health care proxy: Everyone in Massachusetts, 18 or older, has had a conversation (and continues to have conversations) with their proxy to communicate their goals, values and preferences for care at the end of life. o Ensure appro priate training for clinicians: All Massachusetts clinicians have appropriate training to facilitate high -quality communication with patients on advance care planning and serious illness. o Have an informed conversation with one's care team: Everyone in Mass achusetts facing a serious illness has had a high -quality, informed goals and values conversation with their care team. o Create a system to elicit and document wishes: All Massachusetts health care providers have systems in place to elicit and document goal s, values, and preferences for patients with serious illness. o Ensure that preferences can be shared, regardless of place of care: All Massachusetts health care providers have systems in place to share patient goals, values and preferences across care setti ngs, to ensure they are accessible regardless of place of care. Major activities of the Coalition i n 2019 include : 18 o Landmark public messaging research to create new language and concepts for encouraging engagement in advance care planning process in partnership with other state coalition. o Research, which was completed in fall 2019, was featured at conferences and in lectures across the country, including at the National Academy of Science Engineering and Medicine. o An annual public summit at the John F. Kennedy Library, in which the work of coalition member s and results of the consumer research are shared. o A growing list of targeted initiatives includes: A collaborative of the four Massachusetts medical schools to jointly improve the training medical students receive on serious illness communication skills . A partnership with the Mass eHealth Institute, the Department of Public Health and Executive Office of Elder Affairs to design a recommended approach for a statewide infrastructure for digital capture, storage and retrieval of advance care planning documents. The Company provided significant financial support for the adoption of an eMOLST system in the Commonwealth, should matching state resources be available. Partnerships with the state's nursing schools and theological schools, among others. DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION - VOLUNTEERISM - SUSTAINBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH In addition to the community -focused programmatic work detailed previously, the Company works both externally a nd internally through three bodies of work - diversity, eq uity and inclusion ; volunteerism ; and sustainability and environmental health - to further advance its Healthy Living Strategy and broader community benefit s work . These bodies of work are discussed below. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion As the field of effective health promotion strategies continue to develop, geography is a determining factor. Where one lives determines health, economic well -being, and life expec tancy. More so than other factors like access to quality medical care and adequate insurance coverage, one's health is determined by access to nutritious foods, availability of safe places for physical activity, quality housing, connections to shared commu nity spaces, and transportation to living wage jobs. While these desirable places are increasing, they are historically less available to minority populations , those in lower socio -economic brackets, and new immigrants. As a result, people are increasingly facing escalating rates of chronic disease and permanent relegation to a subsistence economy. The Company also understands that race has an independent influence on all the social determinants of health. The Company works collaboratively with a mix of partners to address racial inequities as well as those stemming from racism and other forms of discrimination . The Greater Boston Interfaith Organization (GBIO ) is a broad -based, non -partisan, interfaith, multiracial organization rooted in Greater Boston's neighborhoods and congregations. The Company contributes to and partners with GBIO to better understand social determinants of health from their members, and t o address health disparities in their areas. For more than 20 years, GBIO has worked to improve housing and health care, reform our criminal justice system, address racial disparities in the city, and rebuild schools and neighborhoods, among other issues. The Company supports their Health Care Campaign as they delve further into the issues of prescription drug costs, access to affordable mental health and substance use disorder treatment, and to address the cost of out of network billing. The Company host s www.ahealthyme.com , a health information website available to everyone with internet access. Recognizing the needs of the growing Spanish and Portuguese speaking population s in Massachusetts, the Company has made the website available in Spanish and Portuguese further showcasing the Company's vision to make quality health care affordable and accessible to all. The website gives a diverse population of Massachusetts residents access to health care information, health assessments, tools to better understand health status, and lifestyle tips to promote healthier lifesty les. The Company continued its partnership with the Private Industry Council to provide summer employment to Boston Public High School students. This program helps businesses develop a diverse pipeline of new talent, to supplement the workforce they need and helps Boston area students gain access to career opportunities and higher incomes. In 2019, the Company employed 10 in -house high school interns. Working 19 with its network of community partners, an additional 80 students were placed with not -for-profit organizations throughout Boston, which helped to build capacity and get the important work of these organizations completed during the summer months. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts ' Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) seek to develop a more effective and inclusive work environment for all employees across the Company. Open to all employees, ERGs are powerful tools that support the recruitment, development and retention of diverse, talen ted individuals. Currently, the Company has eight ERGs: Asian Blue Community, AZULatinx, Black Professionals Network, Blue Pride, Empowering Abilities, Vets ERG, Young Professionals Network, Women's Inclusion Network and its subgroup, the Working Parents N etwork. ERGs continue to be powerful tools that support how the Company respects, recruits, and retains its diverse and talented individuals. ERGs have representation of more than 35% of employees (just under 1400 employees are members) throughout the Company. The employee -driven ERGs are led by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts employees who focus their efforts on advancing the D&I strategy through the \"Four C's\" model: culture, career, community, and commerce. ERG leaders are supported by Blue Cr oss Blue Shield of Massachusetts senior leaders, who serve as their executive sponsors. These leaders are visible advocates for the ERGs and provide guidance on issues and challenges. The Foundation published The Faces of MassHealth: Portrait of a Diverse Population , which helps to characterize those served by MassHealth in order to paint a richer, more meaningful picture of the more than one in four Massachusetts residents enrolled in the state's Medicaid program. MassHealth serves our most vulnerable residents across their life spans from infants and children with special needs who gain access to comprehensive health care and support services required to reach their full potential, to the elderly and those living with disabilities who receiv e community based care that helps them remain in their homes and this report illustrates the important role the program serves in supporting individuals in diverse life circumstances. The Foundation launched Going Beyond Health Care , a new grant program i n the Foundation's focus area of social equity and health. Funded at the end of 2018, Going Beyond Health Care supported four interdisciplinary teams, led by social service organizations, and partnered with health care entities, to address the non -clinical and clinical needs of their shared client population. The 2018 grants supported a 2019 planning year for the teams to focus their work at the intersection of health and food access, housing, and trauma in the cities of Boston, Worcester, and Springfield. The planning year allowed the partnerships to explore ways to deepen their collaborative services to better support low -income and vulnerable populations and to develop the infrastructure and workflows needed for more integrated collaboration between often siloed human services and health care entities. The funding provided time for creativity and innovation, research, brainstorming, and to pilot test new approaches. At the end of 2019, the three teams that applied for implementation funding received two -year grants to demonstrate that coordinating services and promoting cross -sector collaboration leads to improved health status for clients, and stabilization or improvement in social needs. If successful, these models could inform other similar approaches as service providers support the overall well -being of their clients, and not just health care or social needs in isolation. The Company received a perfect score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index reflecting the Company's commitme nt to cultivating and maintaining an LGBT+ -friendly workplace. The company was rated on non -discrimination policies, employment benefits, organizational competency and accountability related to LGBT+ diversity and inclusion, public commitment to LGBT+ equa lity, and responsible citizenship. The Massachusetts Institute for Community Health Leadership (MICHL), a program of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation, develops evolving leaders to increase their own personal impact , strengthen their effectiveness in their organization , enhance the organization's influence in the health care system, and understand effective leadership in the context of privilege, health disparities and racial equity. Annually, participants from a variety of backg rounds and diverse employment situations, with the goal of 20 strengthening their effectiveness within their own organizations and enhancing their organizations' influence in our health care system. In order to drive innovation, productivity and growth in today's economy, institutions must design workplaces and community spaces that tap into the gifts of every individual including people with disabilities. Research reveals that companies who embrace best practices for employing and supporting people with di sabilities have outperformed their peers in the marketplace.11 As such, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts invested nearly $60,000 in not -for-profits supporting those with disabilities , as well as engaged in a number of community efforts to promote and evolv e disability awareness and programs . Governor Charl ie Baker appointed the Company's Director of Contract Operations and President of the Empowering Abilities Employee Resource Group to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) Advisory Board. The Commission is focused on eradicating discrimination in the Com monwealth by investigating and prosecuting complaints of discrimination that occur in employment, housing, public places, access to education, lending, and credit. On behalf of the Company and Associated Indust ries of Massachusetts , the Director of Contrac t Operations and President of the Empowering Abilities Employee Reso urce Group testified before WorkAbility, a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Labor and Workforce Development advocating for the employment of peop le with disabilities . The subcommitte e is focused on identifying solutions to promote opportunities for individuals with disabilities to participate and succeed in the state's workforce. After a series of fact -finding hearings , the subcommittee will make recommendations to the legislature on ways to improve opportunities for people with disabilities to participate in the workforce. Similarly, t he Company's Director of Contract Operations and President of the Empowering Abilities Employee Resource Group was also appointed by Att orney General Maura Healey to the Disability Rights Advisory Committee. The committee is comprised of advocates and experts who consult with and advise Attorney General Healey and her staff on matters pertaining to inclusion, access, and equality for indiv iduals with disabilities. In addition to lighting the Prudential Tower blue, the Company collaborated with Partners for Youth with Disabilities and Massachusetts General Hospital's Aspire in honor of April Autism Awareness month by bringing together the community and not -for-profit partners to spread awareness, share educational materials and promote acceptance. Both programs focus on supporting youth and young adults through award -winning mentorship, inclusion and career -readiness programs. The Company was named one of the Best P laces to Work for Disability Inclusion and received a score of 90 on the 2019 Disability Equality Index. This award reflects the continuous efforts to create a safe and inclusive workplace for associates of all abilities . The Index measures culture and lea dership, enterprise - wide access, employment practices, community engagement, and supplier diversity. The Foundation supported the Disability Policy Consortium and the Boston Center for Independent Living within the Strengthening the Voice for Access gran t program that provides operating support to advocacy organizations who are mobilizing communities to affect policy. Together, those two organizations co -chair the Disability Advocates Advancing our Health Care Rights Coalition (DAAHR). DAAHR, a coalition of over 30 disability, elder, and health care organizations, mission is to promote policies that improve health care access and better outcomes for people with disabilities. DAAHR, formed in 2012, has focused on shaping One Care - the managed care program for people who are eligible for both MassHealth and Medicare. DAAHR strengthens the consumer voice, ensuring that people with disabilities have a primary role in decisions about the healthcare systems that impact their lives. The Foundation met regularly with DAAHR in 2019 to discuss the impacts of the transition to ACOs for those with disabilities. 11 Accenture .

(retrieved from: https://www.accenture.com/us - en/about/inclusion -diversity/persons -with-disabilities) 21 Volunteerism There are many organizations in Massachusetts that seek to serve at -risk populations and improve the quality of life and health status of disadvantaged and/or disenfranchised individuals. By providing volunteer support and business expertise to not -for-profit organizations, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts can leverage the combined resources to meet the established needs of vulnerable populations. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts is proud to support employees who give their time and talent to create better neighborhoods in the communities served. Through its volunteer corps \u2014 known as the BlueCrew \u2014 employees service the commun ity in a variety of ways. From one day service projects, to student -mentor relationships, to skills -based volunteer efforts, to a six -month sabbatical program, to not-for-profit board service, employees demonstrate the important value of community service throughout the year. Buoyed by a legacy of community partnership and support, BlueCrew continues to be a hallmark of the Company's commitment to the health of communities. BlueCrew offers employees the opportunity to perform valuable community service in varied activities and for many causes and organizations. Employees receive paid time off to volunteer during regularly scheduled work hours. In 201 9, more than 3, 100 (8 6%) employees participated in 2 85 service projects across 45 Massachusetts communities, contributing 28, 500 volunteer hours. These hours represent a monetary contribution of more than $1M. On September 20, 2019 , the Company built upon its legacy of community partnership and support with its 9th annual, company -wide Service Day: One Community. One Blue. Inspired by the vision and goals of the community, the Service Day campaign gives employees the opportunity to come together in common purpose and shared vision to make a difference for communities across Massachusetts. While the Company remained open for business, 3,000 employees took part in 52 volunteer projects in 36 towns and communities across the state. The p rojects focused on improving the health of child ren and families and included creating new outdoor play spaces for children to stay active, harvesting fresh produce to donate to local food pantries, and cleaning beaches and clearing trails to improve access to green space . In addition to volunteer suppo rt, each Service Day not-for-profit partner received a $5,000 grant for materials to assist in their efforts. A list of Service Day partners can be found in Appendix E. Additionally, the Company celebrated National Volunteer Week in April by partnering with our eight Employee Resource Groups to engage 245 employees in 12 BlueCrew volunteer projects resulting in a contribution of $11,470 to our community partners in one week . The Skills -Based Volunteer Program is designed to strategically deploy Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts ' human capital throughout the social sector. Through the program, volunteers from across the Company use their business knowledge and experience to build capacity at partner organizations in mission -critical areas. In 2019 , the Company integrated the Skills -Based Volunteer Program into the work of the Healthy Living Network. Employees volunteered to share their measurement and evaluation expertise with Healthy Living Network partners during a half -day clinic. In 2005, the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Board of Directors created the William C. Van Faasen Community Service Sabbatical Program which enables one employee each year to take a three to six - month sabbatical leave to work full -time at a not -for-profit organization. The 201 9 Sabbatical Fellow, a training specialist in operations , spent six months working full time with Camp Harbor View , a Boston -based organization provides more than 1,000 youth each year from underserved neighborhoods a free four -week summer camp experience as well as year -round mentoring, social services and other support. The Fellow help ed Camp Harbor View to develop an onboarding pro gram which will include needs assessment, content development, and process recommendations , for the organization's new employees. The importance of civic leadership is felt at all levels and is reflected in senior leader board service. Important responsi bilities are entrusted to the individuals who serve on the boards of not -for-profit organizations. Directors contribute their knowledge and expertise, galvanize external stakeholders, drive fundraising, and otherwise build networks of human associations. I t is vital that new board members 22 understand their roles. With the support of professional training from the Arts and Business Council and one-on-one matching support from our Corporate Citizenship team, 77% of Blue Cross executive leadership served on not-for-profit boards providing valuable skills and insights to our not-for-profit partners. Providing educational support to targeted students remains a focus of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts ' civic engagement pro gram. In 2019, for the tenth consecutive year, volunteers from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts supported Playworks New England to support health and learning for thousands of children across the state. During the 2018 -2019 school year, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts engaged 205 volunteers, supported creation and production of two videos, mentored 12 Junior Coaches from the Dudley Street Neighborhood Charter School, beautified the recess yard for the 323 students at the Congden School in New Bedford, and impacted more than 900 students at three different elementary schools through Play Days. Not only do these programs provide participating students with invaluable educational and mentoring support, they also provide employees with the opportunity to develop professionally while contributing to the Company's leadership role in the community. Sustainability and Environmental Health Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts ' Sustainability and Environmental Health program is anchored in its community benefits work and embedded throughout the organization. The Company believe s that environmental health is essential to personal health and the health of our communities. The Company's business practices are guided by a commitment to responsible stewardship of the environment, and the building, operating, purchasing, and investment policies are designed to have a positive social and environmental impact, especially in diverse and underserved local communities. Five years ago, the C ompany established an ambitious list of 2020 goals focused on reducing the environmental impact of operations while also expanding reach to improve the environmental health of communities and to lend a voice to local and national advocacy issues. To date, the Company has exceeded four of six goals: reduced greenhouse emissions by 34%, paper use by 63%, waste sent to landfills by 40%, and water use by 16%. The Company is making steady progress in increasing the amount of local ly-sourced food served in cafeterias and eliminating toxic chemicals from its offices. The Company ha s aligned these efforts with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. The UN has called for broad -based support, including active involvement by the private sector, which is reflected by the three pillars of the Company's Healthy Living Strategy - healthy eati ng, active lifestyles and access to healthy environments. The Company is also now developing 2025 goals in collaboration with business leaders across the company, defining metrics and setting targets that align sustainability principles with business prior ities. Key initiatives and accomplishments for environmental sustainability in 2019 included: The Company , along with the Treasury Department , research ed, analyze d, and explore d implementing socially responsible investing across investment portfolios. The Company conducted meetings with Private Equity and ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) fund managers and are working on determining the best path forward for future potential social impact investing as part of overall investment strategy. The Company expanded En vironmental Sustainability thought leadership by hosting several industry events including Healthier Products, Healthier People featuring Arlene Blum PhD., Scientist and International Public Health Advocate and other local sustainability leaders for an unc ommon collaboration to introduce chemicals issues and solutions . The Company hosted the second annual Women in Green event convening more than 120 women from fields including architecture, energy, government, construction and the not-for-profit sector in collaboration with the U.S. Green Building Council Massachusetts Chapter. 23 The Company c ollaborated with Environmental League of Massachusetts and corporate council members to work with Massachusetts policy makers toward increasing the carbon emissions reduction target for the state of Massachusetts in order to mitigate climate risk. The Company further positioned environmental sustainability as key factor in internal operations with a focus on company -wide 2020 Sustainability Goals. Partnering with the Food Service team at Company buildings , the Company achieved 19% of food spend focused on local products. Similarly, t he Company worked closely with the Real Estate team to set a challenging target of 65% of overall spend for its building renovation and expansion project to be chemical free for furniture, fixtures, and equipmen t (FFE) . The Company continued to focus on associate engagement and education through an expanded company community garden programming in partnership with The Trustee s of Reservations . The Company hosted eight workshops throughout 2019 educating employees about regenerative agriculture. Last year, more than 150 employees planted, cared for, and harvested plots in the Hingham and Quincy company gardens from May through October, producing more than 5,000 pounds of fresh vegetables and herbs. The Company launched a companywide CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) program and continued its onsite farmers' markets to promote healthy and nutritious food, highlighting local, sustainable food, all suppor ting associate engagement and sustainability. CLOSING Through broad charitable investments to community partners , as well as external and internal diversity, equity and inclusion, volunteerism , and sustainability and environmental health efforts, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts shows its commitment to improving the health and well -being of communities across Massachusetts. In 2019, the Company furthered its work in chronic disease prevention through healthy living initiatives , behavioral health , and health care access for the state's most vulnerable. Moving ahead , the Company will continue its commitment to engage and support Massachusetts communities, including its efforts to address the social determinants of health that are increasingly responsible for the health care challenges faced by underserved populations .

SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH SUPPORTING DATA Massachusetts Health Council 2017 Preventable Conditions and Social Determinants of Health : Access to and consumption of nutritious foods are important determinants of health. While Massachusetts fares better than the rest of the country, a sizable portion of the state's population experiences food insecurity. The level of food insecurity varies by region. There are also disparit ies in the consumption of healthy foods, across racial and ethnic groups, education levels, and gender. About three -quarters of a million people in Massachusetts were food -insecure in 2014. Suffolk (15.9%), Bristol (12.1%), and Hampden (11.7%) counties reported food insecurity rates higher than the statewide rate of 11.1%. Children's HealthWatch and The Greater Boston Food Bank Mass achusetts Cost of Hunger : Food insecurity costs the state of Massachusetts at least $2.4 billion dollars per year. Despite nearly nine years of economic recovery, 1 out of every 10 households in Massachusetts still lacks the resources necessary to afford e nough food for all household members to live active, healthy lives. In 2016, $2.4 billion was spent in health care, special education, and lost work time costs connected to food insecurity. Of the $2.4 billion, about $1.9 billion were direct and indirect h ealth -related costs, and special education accounted for $520 million in expenditures. Commonwealth Magazine Gateway Cities Discover the Power of Food : Over a 12 -month period, more than $4 million in incentives were paid through the Massachusetts Healthy Incentive Program, known as HIP, which reimburses SNAP recipients for the amount they spend at farmers markets, from $40 to $80 a month depending on f amily size. Attendance at farmers markets surged in response to the funding, which also provided a major b oon to growers. U.S. Department of Agriculture: 40 million Americans live in households that don't always have enough food for everyone in th e family. Working -age adults who often go without enough food are at least 40 percent more likely to suffer from l ong-term health problems. The Boston Public Health Commission 2016 -2017 Health of Boston : Personal health behaviors contribute to a person's risk for disease and to one's overall quality of life and well -being. Behaviors such as smoking, excessive alcohol use, and intake of excess calories including sugar -sweetened beverages, contribute to cancers, obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and premature death. Conversely, physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake are protective against each one of those poor health outcomes. The United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley 2017 Community Survey : The number one unmet need facing the state of Massachusetts is affordable housing with drugs and substance use disor der coming in second, followed closely by access to physical and mental health care. Key findings also indicate that 41% of r espondents worry about the ability for families to survive despite the high cost of living. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusett s Foundation Leveraging the Social Determinants of Health: What Works? : Greater attention to the social determinants of health may both improve Americans' health and reduce health care costs. Research suggests that of the factors that determine one's healt h, 20% is attributed to genetics, 20% is attributed to health care, and 60% is attributed to social, environmental and behavioral factors. Increased investment in partnerships between health care and social services can offer health benefits and reduce hea lth care costs for targeted populations. Blue Cross Blue Shield Health Index : The index identifies health conditions with the greatest impact and how the level of health impact of these conditions is i nfluenced by social determinants of health such as socioeconomic conditions, level of education, community health behaviors and local health system characteristics. Additionall y, the index provides county -level health indicators and allows for the objective measurement of specific health conditions that dr ive overall health in each county. The top ten most impactful conditions on the population health of Massachusetts are major depression, hypertension, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, alcohol use disorder, psychotic disorder, substance use disord er, type II diabetes, Crohn's disease, and hyperactivity related conditions. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's Understanding Health Conditions Across the U.S.: Moody's Analytics used data collected through the aforementioned Blue Cross Blue Shield Heal th Index, to compile a report that identified health conditions and how they are influenced by social determinants of health. Physical health cond itions, mental health conditions and unique health conditions are crucial for understanding variations in comm unity health and assessing which conditions, are likely to contribute to poor health. Physical health conditions (high choles terol, coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes) are strongly associated with ove rall health and have a larger adverse effect on population health in places with socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral challenges. In contrast, mental health conditions (hyperactivity and depression/ anxiety/affective disorder) are m ore likely to have large effects in counties that have fewer socioeconomic, demographic and behavioral challenges. Finally, unique conditions (breast cancer, lung cancer, and substance abuse disorder) do not fit into either of these categories as a result of the unique ways they influence health. 25 APPENDIX B.
