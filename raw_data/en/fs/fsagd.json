Popping a lot of vitamins seems healthy but Emily Dunn asks whether supplements are just money down the drain, or even dangerous. Take a stroll down the aisle marked ''Health'' in any supermarket and you could easily believe the cure for any ailment or illness is on the shelf. The alternative medicine market, one of the fastest-growing segments in the health sector, has an estimated annual turnover of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, with almost three-quarters of us reaching for a vitamin, mineral or herbal supplement in the past year. For most healthy people, however, taking supplements is not only unwarranted but could be doing us more harm than good. Accredited nutritionist with the Dietitians Association of Australia, Lucinda Hancock, says some groups of people need nutritional supplements, such as pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly, those with allergies, or those on restrictive diets, such as vegans, but most of us have no need for them. ''The general rule of thought is that if you are eating a wide range of foods from the dietary guidelines, you don't need a vitamin supplement,'' Hancock says. For those concerned they might have a deficiency, there is a simple way to be sure. ''Go to your GP and have a blood test that can categorically identify if you are deficient,'' Hancock says. ''Otherwise, you are just making a guess and potentially wasting money buying supplements you might not need, or missing out on what you are actually deficient in.'' A naturopath, homeopath and nutritionist, Emma Sutherland, also has a ''food first'' philosophy but she says most people derive some benefit from taking a good multivitamin and a fish-oil supplement. ''There is an attitude that supplements are an expensive way to change the colour of your wee,'' she says. ''My philosophy is always food first but the issue is that our food no longer contains the high nutritional quality that it once did.'' Consumers are often unsure how long fruit and vegetables have been stored, which affects water-soluble nutrients such as vitamin C, so Sutherland says a good-quality multivitamin is best for preventive health. However, she warns consumers to exercise caution when it comes to choosing a supplement from the supermarket health aisle. Popping a Berocca for example, which is high in sugar, is not going to be of great benefit to someone deficient in B vitamins. ''It is best to go and see somebody who is trained,'' Sutherland says. ''If a supplement can help them, it is better than taking a pharmaceutical with side effects.'' Fish oils are another important supplement. They have been shown to help with inflammation. ''All chronic disease - such as cancer, diabetes and even asthma - begins with inflammation,'' she says. ''It can be hard to get enough of these oils from fish alone.'' A spokesman for the Dietitians Association of Australia, Trent Watson, agrees that fish-oil supplements are beneficial for those suffering from inflammatory conditions but adds that supplements come second to diet and lifestyle. The same rule applies to other popular supplements of the moment, such as zinc, to ward off colds. ''Food provides the best quantities and combinations of nutrients to ensure we maximise and optimise our immune response,'' Watson says. ''It is not only zinc that helps our immune system; iron is also important.'' She also warns that people who misuse supplements can face a much bigger problem than ''expensive wee''. ''Just because something is good, taking more of it is not necessarily better,'' he says. ''When we isolate these things and supplement them, they can increase our risk of death and disease, not reduce it.'' Antioxidants such as beta-carotene, found in orange vegetables and often promoted as heroes in the fight against free radicals, are a case in point. In the 1990s, a study examined the effect of large doses of beta-carotene on smokers and found it increased their chances of lung cancer. Likewise, research from New Zealand last year indicated that people on calcium supplements had a 30 per cent higher risk of heart attack, an effect not seen in people with diets high in calcium. ''It is a naive approach to think humans can somehow do it better than evolution and make something better for us than nature,'' Watson says. "}
