As of February 10, 2022, the State of Nevada has rescinded its mask mandate for most public facilities.

Our clinic requires the use of masks by all our administration and staff, regardless of vaccination status. If you would like your child to wear a mask, please inform your child's therapy team. Masks are otherwise required for all parents, siblings, and family members entering Nevada Autism Center. To review Nevada Governor Sisolak's message, please click here.
