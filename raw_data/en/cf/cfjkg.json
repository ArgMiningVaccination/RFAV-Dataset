INNER BALANCE itself is a physical space that is dedicated to encouraging conscious, compassion-filled, vital lives. Classes, recurring events and a range of coaching and therapeutic treatments are available at Inner Balance in Northbrook and Chicago. Many events are free or donation based. More information about Inner Balance can be found at www.innerbalancenow.com. A monthly 90-minute guided meditation session, open to the public, is led by Ellen Radha Katz, psychotherapist and meditation teacher. Each week is unique. The session often begins with gentle breath awareness and/or yoga based stretching for centering, followed by a deep guided meditation. Other instructors contribute to the sessions, in such areas as Mindfulness, Chakra Balancing, Present Time Consciousness, Jin Shin Jitsui, Reiki, Kirtan (bhakti yoga through devotional chanting) and other practices. At times this Meetup will share information about a program that is happening elsewhere but may be of interest to some of the Inner Balance Meetup members. They are endorsed by this Meetup. Ellen can be reached personally for further information here as the coordinator, or at her website: www.ellenkatz.net.

ABOUT THIS INNER BALANCE MEDITATION SERIES: Every third Tuesday of the month, Ellen (Radha) offers a gentle, guided healing meditation. The sessions often begin with simple upper body (sitting) stretches, then move into awareness of breath, internal senses and finally, guided meditation. We are led into a space that feels somewhere been here and not here... connecting us to our pre-conscious and subconscious states. With her gentle voice and intentional words, Ellen helps us tap into our individual capacities for healing and compassion. Each session unfolds organically, connecting us intimately with ourselves. This provides an internal sense of emotional safety, and combined with the peaceful, accepting group energy results in an experience of deep restoration. Ellen (Radha) Is a licensed psychotherapist and a seasoned meditation instructor. She has studied and immersed herself in a wide range of spiritual teachings, practices and communities throughout the course of her life. There is no cost. Please share your love, kindness, and compassion generously with all you come in contact, and most profoundly with yourself! - Life Mission ExplorationLink visible for attendees Uncover clues & insights so you can move forward with more purpose and meaning.

COST: Throughout this challenging period we have elected to forego accepting donations on behalf of the Sangha and we will continue that practice for the time being. The expenses that we have incurred and the time and energy that we have invested into presenting these events have gone and will continue to go towards enhancing our own respective practice's of Dana (Generosity). However if you still feel compelled to make a contribution we would be honored if you chose to donate those funds to one of the organizations we currently support instead: Feed My Starving Children, A Just Harvest or La Casa Norte. If you elect to sit with us in person a voluntary donation to help offset expenses would be most appreciated but is by no means expected. May your practice of Dana bring you much Mudita (Altruistic joy)! If you have any questions about this particular sitting or our meditation community in general, please feel free to contact us. We are looking forward to sitting in practice and sharing energy in the present moment with all who choose to attend. With Metta, Mark and Tony "}
