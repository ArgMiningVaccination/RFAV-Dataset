The College of Agriculture, with its research, teach-ing, and extension activities, has developed a structure and organization to provide the mandated land-grant services in agriculture and related areas. The Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station has been providing research results to farmers and rural residents for more than 100 years. The continued advancement of Kentucky agriculture attests to the benefits of applying new knowledge and technology. Much of the research leading to increased quantity and improved quality of Kentucky's agricultural output was performed by the Experiment Station. College research-ers also have successfully addressed problems of agribusiness, consumers, international trade, food processing, nutrition, community development, soil and water resources, bioenergy, and the environment. Although much Experiment Station research has immediate application to agricultural- and natural resource-related prob-lems, scientists are also involved in basic research, generating new information to help solve present and potential problems. The ability of Kentucky producers to be competitive in domestic and world markets requires an expanded base of knowledge in emerging areas of research applicable to agriculture, food, and natural resources. This Annual Report lists Experiment Station research proj- ects and publications completed during 2009. A personnel list is also provided. The research programs of the Kentucky Agricultural Ex - periment Station have benefited Kentucky's agriculture over the past century, and the results of present and future research will continue to serve Kentucky's primary industry. Research activities of the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station were conducted at Lexington, Princeton, Quicksand, and Owenton and in counties throughout the state in 2009. Efforts are constantly made to ensure that the research studies have application to the problems of all Kentucky farmers and other clientele groups. Locations of the experimental facili-ties provide conditions representative of most sections of the state.

Purpose of the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station Statewide Research7Unit Reports Equine Initiative In March 2005, UK's College of Agriculture set out to better serve Kentucky's multi-breed horse industry by building on the university's strong tradition of excellence in equine research, instruction, and service and to enhance the state's well-deserved status as the \"Horse Capital of the World. \" UK President Lee T . T odd Jr. named the Equine Initiative as one of UK's \"Common-wealth Collaboratives, \" a term encompassing projects aimed at improving Kentucky's schools, business climate, environment, health care, and lifestyles. The mission of the Equine Initiative is to discover, share, and apply new knowledge that will enhance the health, per - formance, and management of horses commensurate with the signature status of Kentucky's horse industry. It is an overarch-ing framework for all equine programs at UK and employs a cross-departmental and cross-disciplinary approach within the College of Agriculture. The Equine Initiative is reflective of UK's T op 20 vision and since its inception has attracted new students, new faculty, and new research and outreach opportunities for the state. Its ultimate goal will be realized when UK becomes the world leader in equine teaching, research, and outreach/extension. Currently, the College of Agriculture has an equine focus that includes a team of more than 50 faculty and staff working from eight different departments. Eight new horse-oriented faculty have been hired since the Equine Initiative's inception. One of the most tangible of the Equine Initiative's enhance- ments was the formation of an undergraduate degree program. There are now 110 students in the program, with just over 50 percent from outside Kentucky. While a lot of other schools have an equine major of some type, only two other land-grant universities in the United States\u2014Colorado State and Arizona State\u2014have stand-alone equine degree programs. Noteworthy Developments in 2009 Some of the notable programs and partnerships undertaken or continued by the Equine Initiative include: The launch of a free monthly equine research e-newsletter in conjunction with TheHorse.com called the \"Bluegrass Equine Digest. \" This publication features equine research happening at UK. It has 18,000 monthly subscribers as well as one of the highest click-through rates for stories appearing in TheHorse .com's newsletters. Recognition as the official equine program for the 2010 Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games. The Equine Initiative will be part of the UK Village at the games. A partnership with UKHealthCare called \"Saddle Up Safely.\" With a goal of making a great sport safer, the campaign aims to help riders more safely engage in their passion. The five-year program is designed to be a lasting legacy of the 2010 Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games. The campaign includes brochures, continuing medical education opportunities, education-based programs, a volunteer-based speakers auxiliary, a Web site featuring safety tips and stories from injured riders, and a Web log hosted by Fernanda Camargo, an assistant professor in the College of Agriculture and head of Kentucky's 4-H horse program. Working with top reproductive scientists and veterinarians at Hagyard Equine Medical Institute and Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital to help plan for the next International Equine Symposium on Reproduction. It is to take place in Kentucky in 2010 and will attract scientists from across the world to UK's campus. Partnering with the University of Louisville on hosting a biennial Kentucky International Equine Summit in 2010. The focus of the program will be to help volunteer leaders of equine organizations discover and implement practical solu- tions to the challenges facing their diverse industry through enhanced communication, scientific research, and expansive cooperation. Design of a consortium booth themed \"Where else for an equine education?\" by UK and eight other equine higher-edu-cation programs recognized by the Council of Postsecondary Education. The booth will promote Kentucky as the place for students to look to for an equine higher education. This booth will be part of the 2010 Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games in the Equine Village and will also serve as a legacy effort, enabling representatives from the schools to travel to events around the country and promote horse programs in Kentucky in the years ahead. The Equine Initiative worked with these schools throughout most of 2009 to implement a shared vision. A first-ever equine-focused field day held June 1 that attracted more than 150 attendees to UK's Maine Chance Equine Campus to learn about topics spanning pasture management, weed control, reproductive research, and environmental compliance. Partnering with Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital on Hats Off to Kentucky's Horse Industry Day, a free day at the Ken- tucky Horse Park that educates the general public about the importance of Kentucky's horse industry and raises money for important equine charities. Sponsoring a Distinguished Lecture Series to showcase prominent equine industry leaders and provide students and the general public the opportunity to listen to an interview conducted with these industry leaders and interact with them. The inaugural speaker in November was Nick Nicholson, president of Keeneland. Naming Dan Rosenberg a Friend of the Equine Initiative for his support and guidance since the Equine Initiative's incep- tion. Hosting a student career fair through the Equine Initiative's Student Working Group. The fair attracted more than 30 area businesses and featured talks about careers and job hunting for equine students at UK as well as many other area university 8Kentucky Tobacco Research and Development Center The Kentucky T obacco Research and Development Center (KTRDC) conducts and supports unique research programs that examine new agricultural crop opportunities based on tobacco and other plants. The KTRDC program emphasizes applications-oriented research specifically designed to facilitate the development of new crop-based businesses and technologies for Kentucky agriculture. KTRDC-funded projects explore the development and use of tobacco as a production system for plant-made pharmaceuticals and industrial products and the discovery and development of new plant natural products having potential for commercialization. Located in its own building on the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, the Center is funded by a dedicated tax on cigarette sales in Kentucky. Tobacco/PM(I)P Research Agriculture is realizing huge benefits from improved crops developed through application of plant biotechnology. These new crop varieties exhibit such useful qualities as remarkable resistance to insect damage, markedly reduced dependence on herbicides, etc. Following these advances in crop-performance traits, there is increasing interest in engineering plants to make new products, thereby enabling agricultural crops to be used as renewable resources supplying such valuable materials as medical drugs, industrial enzymes, specialty plastics, and novel food ingredients. These new applications for plants, including tobacco, have the potential to generate entirely new markets for farmers and growers. Such new opportunities are constantly in demand as traditional tobacco agriculture declines and the fam-ily farm seeks new agricultural markets. And while the produc - tion of protein-based medical drugs in plants might be regarded as competitive with traditional methods of manufacturing them (fermentation using cultured microbes and animal cells), the use of plants to make industrial materials that are conventionally obtained from petroleum will obviously be of immense benefit in a future of rising and fluctuating oil prices. The primary goal of KTRDC research is to facilitate and encourage the use of tobacco in Kentucky as a production sys - tem for plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs) and plant-made industrial products (PMIPs).Research on Plant Natural Products The Center is also developing new technologies to expand the discovery and use of non-protein substances that are made naturally by tobacco and other plants, collectively referred to as \"plant natural products. \" Many plant natural products are familiar as flavors and fragrances, medicinals, and natural in-secticides. Moreover, as mentioned above, many chemicals and consumer-products companies are now taking a serious look at plants as alternatives to petroleum as sources of industrial \"feedstocks\" for manufacturing plastics, adhesives, and other familiar materials. This application for plants, which is develop-ing in parallel with the more familiar biofuels opportunities, is poised for very rapid expansion and development. The Center's research on plant natural products encompasses several approaches and aspects, including metabolic engineer - ing of the plant to diversify and customize the natural products themselves, development of novel detection and screening methods to facilitate natural-product discovery, manipulation of the plant genome to increase yields of biomass and specific natural products, \"domestication\" of uncultivated species to make them viable as new crops, etc. Research and Services The overall objective of KTRDC research is to encourage and facilitate the development of new crop opportunities for Kentucky agriculture based on new applications for the tobacco plant and new plant-derived \"natural products. \" KTRDC-funded projects address this objective in several different ways: Optimizing the tobacco plant, and tobacco production, for PM(I)P applications; Devising new \"support\" technologies for PM(I)P commer - cialization, addressing bioprocessing, harvesting, identity preservation, and regulatory compliance, etc.; Developing new technologies for enhanced gene expression, metabolic engineering, and discovery of novel natural prod-ucts in plants; Discovering and developing new plant-product concepts having potential to create new markets; Assisting companies to explore the use of plants as manufac - turing systems for new products.and college equine programs. The success of this fair has led to plans for yearly career fairs hosted by UK. Program areas of excellence for equine science in the College of Agriculture include: Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center: Developed vaccines against six of the 10 most common equine infectious diseases. Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center: Serves as an animal health sentinel and has the highest equine caseload in the world. Department of Animal and Food Sciences: Has a notable legacy in nutrition research. 4-H and Y outh Programs: Reach more than 6,000 youth. Horse College, an adult education program: Reaches more than 1,500 people. Pasture Evaluation Program: Has evaluated more than 50 horse farms and 3,700 acres in central Kentucky. Economic Cluster: Concept expansion. Horse Environments: Research on mud, pervious concrete, stream crossings, and more. HorseQuest: Central Web-based source for information.9 KTRDC research is conducted by a team of scientists and faculty at the Center's facilities and also through grants to university faculty in Kentucky. KTRDC grants enable investi-gators to initiate new lines of research having relevance to the KTRDC program, such as improved gene-vector systems for high-level expression of proteins in tobacco and new strategies for extraction and purification of protein products from plants. In addition, KTRDC in-house research emphasizes longer-term projects and ongoing services, as illustrated by the following examples: Developing prototype tobacco plants to explore the potential of newly discovered genes to enhance plant performance: Dr. Indu Maiti's research group uses promoter technology proprietary to the University of Kentucky to prepare transgenic plants for collabo-rators in the commercial and academic environments. Economic modeling of new applications for tobacco: Dr. Orlando Chambers' research includes detailed analysis of tobacco pro-duction strategies as well as in-depth surveys of markets and the commercial potential for diverse product types that might be derived through tobacco farming. This research is used in the design of new tobacco varieties for PMP applications and to assist companies that may become future customers of the tobacco farmer. Manipulation of \"plant natural products\": The enormous variety of medicinal substances, food ingredients, and structural materials obtained routinely from plants attests to their vast potential to produce useful chemical compounds. Dr. George Wagner's research explores novel materials pro- duced on the surface of the tobacco leaf, which have potential use as pesticides, industrial chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Dr. Ling Yuan is exploring the genetic regulation underlying the production of natural products in plant cells and aims to apply this knowledge to develop novel plants that make useful new substances. Dr. Guiliang T ang investigates plant natural product pathways using gene silencing technology. Development of a new tobacco variety and optimized tobacco produc- tion system for PMP applications: KTRDC research conducted by Drs. David Zaitlin, Orlando Chambers, and Rich Mundell is focused on the development of a new tobacco type that will be more economical to produce and better suited to the new ap-plications of the plant as a protein-manufacturing system. The desired new \"vehicle\" variety for field-based production will exhibit such characteristics as disease resistance (blue mold, black shank), more economical production through multiple (mechanized) harvesting, compatibility with all appropriate gene expression systems, and several features that will obviate any possibility of commingling with conventional tobacco (i.e., providing \"identity preservation\"). A separate line of research is aimed at developing an equivalent \"vehicle\" variety for production exclusively in a contained environment such as greenhouses. This variety-development research has resulted in considerable collaboration and contract-funded work with industry as companies developing the gene-expression tech- nologies and products for PM(I)P applications of tobacco have sought help from KTRDC in regard to the agricultural aspects of implementing scaled-up production. KTRDC's support has, in turn, helped showcase Kentucky as a possible location for the companies' future operations. Facilities and Equipment The KTRDC building provides approximately 66,000 square feet of laboratory and office space. State-of-the-art growth rooms provide controlled, round-the-clock, monitored environ-ments for propagation and maintenance of plants and cultured plant tissues. Greenhouse space is available nearby, and KTRDC has its own greenhouses at the university's Spindletop Farm in Lexington. KTRDC houses equipment for DNA sequencing and analy - sis, DNA microarray technology, automated liquid handling, most forms of chromatography, and basic mass spectrometry. All KTRDC offices and laboratories are equipped with high-speed data ports and a wireless Internet system for computer networking. Noteworthy Developments in 2009 Full details of the research progress made by KTRDC-funded scientists in 2009 can be found in a separate KTRDC Annual Report for 2008-09 available directly from the Center. The fol-lowing highlights serve to illustrate some of this work. KTRDC research in support of tobacco-based production of pharmaceuticals and industrial products has continued productively on several fronts. Thorough review of the history of commercial development of the plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs) concept suggests that today's PMP focus on produc - tion of vaccines and off-patent pharmaceuticals has a much better chance of success than the industry's former emphasis on high-value, on-patent proteins. Progressive improvements and advances in the technologies employed in the PMP strategy, including methods and techniques currently in use at KTRDC, also contribute to these improved prospects. Consistent with these developments and with the current industry trend toward indoor greenhouse production for the medical products, the KTRDC farm team has been engaged in developing tobacco types and cultivation methods that are optimally suited to this very different way of producing tobacco. This work, managed by Dr. Maelor Davies and Dr. Chambers, is largely supported by a commercial research contract from a company that is relatively new to the PMP opportunity. Through the provision of a new KTRDC research grant to a UK research team led by Dr. Yuan, in collaboration with Kentucky Bioprocessing (KBP) in Owensboro, Kentucky, the Center is also continuing to support work aimed at making industrial products in tobacco. In this particular project, the intended commercial product will be a novel enzyme for use in the manufacturing of biofuels. Industrial products are likely to be made using field-produced plants. The Center has also collaborated with KBP on methods for efficient harvesting of field-grown tobacco for these new purposes. As these projected new tobacco uses continue to progress, interest in the enhancement of traditional tobacco production 10using transgenics is also increasing. Dr. Davies is conducting a grant-supported study of the feasibility and potential value of transgenic enhancements to traditional tobacco. For any trans - genic production, it will be necessary to evaluate and develop improved containment measures to ensure adequate segrega-tion of genetically engineered tobacco from the conventional crop. At KTRDC, the results from Dr. Mundell's six-year study on tobacco seed's persistence in the environment indicate that transgenic tobacco seed could remain viable longer than the currently mandated monitoring period. Results from a plant-topping and flower-removal study also indicate that improve-ments may be necessary in the generally approved methods for containment of transgenic tobacco, as under appropriate condi- tions, removed flowers will continue to develop, dehisce pollen, and potentially produce viable seeds. We anticipate that these findings will prove useful in the future development of improved containment measures. Collectively, the above projects illustrate KTRDC's continued commitment and progress in support of new prospects for Kentucky's tobacco agriculture. Research conducted at KTRDC has continued to advance the development of strategies to combat blue mold, a disease of tobacco that continues to pose a threat to efficient produc - tion for both traditional and new uses of the crop. Dr. Zaitlin has measured the genome size of the blue mold pathogen, Peronospora tabacina, and found it to be 60 million base pairs. This size compares favorably with the genome sizes of other, closely related plant pathogens. In a collaboration with the UK Advanced Genetic T echnologies Center, the nucleotide sequence of the blue mold genome was determined using a Roche/454 Genome Sequencer, an instrument that employs the very latest in massively parallel, high-throughput DNA sequencing chemistries. Dr. Zaitlin anticipates that analysis of the genome sequence (gene prediction and annotation) will allow him to identify genes involved in establishment of blue mold disease on susceptible tobacco. Preliminary results from Dr. Wagner's research with leaf-surface substances called phyl-loplanins suggest that over-expression of these native substances in the tobacco plant may reduce its susceptibility to the disease. This pioneering work has been conducted in collaboration with the Plant Genetic Engineering Service directed by Dr. Maiti at KTRDC. The service, which uses proprietary gene-expression technologies developed by Dr. Maiti, also initiated an exciting new collaborative project in 2009 aimed at customization of plants for more efficient production of biofuels. In KTRDC research on plant natural products, Dr. John Littleton reports that during 2009 his team made excellent progress in developing selection procedures that enable the team to identify mutant plant cell cultures that overproduce substances having potential value as pharmaceuticals. One of the best examples concerns the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle). This plant is used to produce the extremely expensive vinca alkaloids, which are used in the chemotherapy-based treatment of leukemias and lymphomas. The researchers were able to show that a selected population of cultures contained higher levels of substances resembling the vinca alkaloids than the nonselected population. This technol-ogy makes it possible to direct the cellular evolution of plant cells toward greater production of these economically and therapeu-tically valuable natural products. Dr. Yuan's group reports the isolation of a tobacco gene that plays a key regulatory role in governing the plant's production of the class of natural products called anthocyanins. Research into this and other \"transcription factor\" genes is expected to yield new technologies for enhanc - ing the plant's production of useful materials in the future. Also in the field of plant natural products, Dr. T ang has continued to make progress in harnessing the latest \"microRNA \" technology to develop a special genetic \"tool\" that can be used to switch off the operation of several genes in the plant at the same time. This invention should also prove useful in the design of plants that will make novel products. In KTRDC research into new agricultural biotechnologies, Dr. Jan Smalle highlights his identification of a new mechanism that controls plant size. This mechanism involves control of protein degradation, and it regulates the equilibrium between cell division and cell expansion in plant shoot organs. KTRDC has provided research funding for this project as part of the Center's continuing interest in promoting research relevant to plant productivity for future production of biofuels and other biomaterials. Dr. Hongyan Zhu has continued to advance the use of plant genomics technologies to improve the important forage crop, alfalfa. Significant progress was made with a KTRDC-funded project toward cloning a gene that may confer resistance to powdery mildew disease. Dr. Zhu also reports an exciting advancement in our understanding of how legume plants such as soybeans and alfalfa utilize atmospheric nitrogen; intriguingly, the plant's mechanism for associating with bacteria that conduct the nitrogen \"fixation\" process may be related genetically to its mechanisms for recognizing bacteria that cause disease. It is also a pleasure to report as a highlight of 2009 that KTRDC was again able to fund a grants program. The one-year pilot-project grants are intended to enable the recipients to generate preliminary research data that will then be used in applications to other funding sources. The new program attracted many proposals, and the successful applicants will conduct research in many fields relevant to the Center's mission. It is especially pleasing to note the inclusion of some topics that we have not supported in previous years, such as applications of nanotechnology to plants.11Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center Administration Craig N. Carter The Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center (LDDC) strives to be one of the premier veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the United States, providing the very best and most timely services in support of the practicing veterinary profession, Kentucky animal agriculture, the signature equine industries, companion animals, and public health. As the state's flagship veterinary diagnostic laboratory, the LDDC's primary goal is to develop, apply, and utilize state-of-the-art veterinary diagnostic testing methods and scientific knowledge to improve animal health and marketability, preserve the human-animal bond, and help protect and improve public health through the early and ac - curate identification of zoonotic diseases. In addition to its clinical diagnostic role, the LDDC provides surveillance for emerging and endemic diseases such as West Nile virus, chronic wasting disease of deer, contagious equine metritis, bovine spongiform encephalitis (mad cow disease), and avian influenza. Furthermore, the laboratory is always on the watch for the emergence of foreign animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever. Animal owners use the LDDC's services through their prac - ticing veterinarians who have expertise in selecting, preparing, shipping, and submitting the proper specimens for testing when necessary. Laboratory findings are reported back to the submit - ting veterinarian who then consults with his or her clients to implement a treatment protocol or a preventative solution to disease problems on the farm. The LDDC faculty, scientists, and technical staff are special- ists in essential scientific disciplines directly related to animal health including bacteriology, clinical pathology, epidemiology, extension, molecular biology, pathology, serology, toxicology, virology, and informatics. Disease diagnostic efforts are co-ordinated and handled by specialists in the appropriate disci-plines. Complex clinical cases involving multiple sections are monitored by highly qualified case coordinators. The LDDC is organized into sections so that specialized workload/activities can be handled efficiently. 2009 Highlights: The American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Di- agnosticians (AA VLD) is the national accrediting agency for state and university veterinary diagnostic laboratories. After two years of intense preparation, the AA VLD Accreditation T eam inspected the LDDC in May 2009. In July 2009, the LDDC director was notified that the laboratory had achieved full ac - creditation for the first time in history. This achievement inspires confidence in LDDC clients and Kentucky's animal agricultural trading partners. Soon after receiving AA VLD accreditation, the LDDC ap- plied for membership status in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. This network provides surge capacity for the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in the face of seri-ous disease outbreaks. Based on its credentials, the LDDC was approved as a full member in October 2009. Laboratory staff are now being trained to conduct specialized testing in response to an outbreak. The LDDC will receive a minimum grant in the amount of $50,000 per year from the USDA to purchase equip-ment/reagents and to conduct any necessary training. In September 2008, a groundbreaking ceremony was held to signify the start of a $28.5 million renovation/expansion construction project that will nearly double the square footage of the facility. During 2009, all foundation work, structural steel, and much of the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work was completed. The current schedule for occupancy of the new/renovated facilities is as follows: New necropsy facility\u2014occupancy by January 2010. New administration/education wing\u2014occupancy by August 2010. New pathology offices and serology and histology laborato- ries\u2014occupancy by June 2010. Balance of renovation\u2014completed by January 2010. The LDDC received roughly 3,268 cases in 2009 (down roughly 8% from 2008), including almost 3,000 complete necrop- sies. The caseload decrease correlates with the general economic downturn for 2009. T otal tests run in each laboratory section will be listed in the individual section reports. The LDDC implemented a new fee/test schedule in 2009 that charges per test for all equine accessions. This and other adjustments to the schedule resulted in a $219,390 increase in fee income for 2009 (increase of 21.1%). These funds will be used to replace aging instrumentation and equipment in various laboratory sections. The LDDC successfully implemented a new Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) and a new billing system on Aug. 1, 2009. This state-of-the-art system is part of a statewide animal health network that will soon be complete. The new system offers new services to clients such as emailing of laboratory reports and Web access to client data. Support for handheld devices is in the planning stages. The LDDC continues to build its outreach programs around Kentucky. The LDDC staffed an exhibit in Lexington for the Kentucky Cattlemen's Association annual meeting in January 2009 and also in Louisville for the Kentucky Veterinary Medi- cal Association (KVMA) annual meeting in October 2009. The Kentucky VetLabNet listserv continues to distribute animal health bulletins and has grown to a list of over 550 LDDC clients. Over 200 field investigations were conducted by the epidemiol-ogy section on Kentucky farms, mostly in support of a research project to quantify exposure of foals to Rhodococcus equi. The LDDC still contributes articles quarterly to the KVMA journal and the Kentucky Cattlemen's Association Cow Country News. The LDDC director, faculty, and staff continue to deliver lectures at scientific and lay meetings and participate in the monthly Equine Diagnostic Research Seminar Series at the LDDC.12 The LDDC has been fortunate to recruit some topnotch faculty and staff in 2009. Many thanks to Deans Scott Smith and Nancy Cox for their assistance in making this recruitment possible. The following positions have been filled: Dr. Michelle Bilderback, Ruminant Extension Veterinarian Bonnie Decker, Clinical Pathology Section Chief. Some research projects in progress during 2009 at LDDC were as follows: Kentucky Horse Racing Commission race horse breakdown project, Dr. Laura Kennedy Wobbler syndrome, Dr. Jennifer Janes Contracted foal syndrome, Dr. Craig Carter Continuous health monitoring of cattle, Dr. Craig Carter, Jackie Smith Animal disease cluster detection, Dr. Craig Carter Contagious equine metritis trial, Dr. Mike Donahue Enhanced herpes PCR screening, Steve Sells Rhodococcus equi pneumonia in foals, Dr. Craig Carter, Jackie Smith Nocardioform placentitis study, Dr. Neil Williams, Steve Sells Equine uterine rupture study, Dr. Cindy Gaskill, Dr. Lori Smith, Dr. Neil Williams. Dr. (Lt. Col.) Carney Jackson, LDDC veterinary pathologist and member of the Kentucky Air National Guard, deployed to Afghanistan with an agricultural development team in June 2009 for a period of one year. On this deployment, he is assisting the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture, two veterinary schools, and farmers by providing animal health training. His team is also involved in capacity building for animal agricultural operations in and around Kabul, Afghanistan. Dr. Jackson is scheduled to be back in his position at LDDC sometime around July 2010. Dr. Craig Carter, LDDC director, assumed the role of presi- dent-elect of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians. In this role, Dr. Carter is program chair for the annual meeting that will be held in Minneapolis in November 2010. Dr. Carter is also executive director of the World Associa-tion of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians. In this role, he oversaw the planning for a scientific symposium on diagnostic veterinary medicine in Madrid, Spain, in June 2009. Bacteriology/Mycology Mike Donahue The primary mission of the Bacteriology/Mycology Section of the LDDC is to detect or isolate and identify pathogenic bac - teria or fungi present in animals. The section also determines the antibiotics that might be used for the treatment of specific bacterial infections. The section is also responsible for culture of T aylorella equigenitalis and T. asinigenitalis for the federal/ state CEM regulatory program in equine. 2009 Highlights: Approximately 11,500 aerobic cultures were performed on samples submitted to the LDDC; significant bacterial patho-gens were found in about 50% of the samples. Approximately 1,100 milk samples from dairy cows were tested for microorganisms that cause mastitis; over 50% were positive for pathogenic microorganisms. Approximately 2,500 different bacterial isolates were tested to determine the antibiotics that could be used for their treat - ment in exposed animals. Approximately 9,350 samples from equines in Kentucky were cultured for the contagious equine metritis organisms. All horses tested were negative for T. asinigenitalis and T. equigenitalis . Because of the detection of four positive stallions by this section in late 2008, the number of samples received was about 33% higher than in 2008. Nationwide, 22 stallions and five mares were confirmed to be infected. Early detec - tion of this infection in the Quarter Horse population by this laboratory prevented this disease from becoming more widespread in the U.S. equine population. In cooperation with researchers at Michigan State University, the normal flora of the genital tract of male donkeys is being determined. An important preliminary finding of this study is that T aylorella asinigenitalis , one of the bacteria causing contagious equine metritis, is sometimes a part of the normal flora of male donkeys and that it can persist for at least 12 months in these animals. An investigation was undertaken with researchers at UK's Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center to determine if the treatment of semen with antibiotics will prevent the transmis - sion of T. equigenitalis to mares bred by artificial insemination. Preliminary results indicated that the antibiotics did prevent the transmission of the disease. Approximately 1,750 samples from horses were tested for the presence of leptospires and tissues from 24 fetuses and/or placentas were positive. In conjunction with the Molecular Biology Section of the LDDC, we are continuing to evaluate a PCR method for detecting Crossiella equi and Amycolatopsis spp. in equine placentas. These bacteria the primary cause of nocardio- form placentitis in equine. Determined that the serovars of salmonellae involved in equine salmonellosis belong to either serogroup B or sero- group C. This information is being used to help in the for - mulation of a salmonella bacterin that can be used in central Kentucky. 13Clinical Pathology Bonnie L. Decker The primary mission of the Clinical Pathology Section of the LDDC is to provide chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, fluid analysis, fecal parasite exams, and other testing to animal own-ers, veterinarians, and the agricultural community. The section also provides support and testing to the LDDC's pathologists and testing related to necropsy as well as University of Ken- tucky equine and animal science researchers who can submit specimens to the section for monitoring various chemistry and hematology levels in their research animals. The section is expe - riencing growth with the plan to add endocrine tests and a new hematology analyzer that will allow additional animal species to be tested. Computer interface for the ACE Alera chemistry analyzer is in the works for more efficient results entry and re-duction of human transcription errors. The section is dedicated to meeting the current and future needs of the agricultural community, companion animal community, and veterinarians. 2009 Highlights: Approximately 614 chemistry test panels were performed on equine, bovine, caprine, ovine, feline, canine, and other spe-cies. This represented over 10,548 individual chemistry tests. Approximately 502 complete blood counts and 505 manual differentials were performed. Approximately 1,211 fecal specimens were submitted for fecal flotation and examination for ova and parasites. In addition, 124 specimens were submitted for cryptosporidia. Approximately 361 stones were submitted for chemical stone analysis. A wide variety of stones were identified, with triple phosphate (struvite) and calcium oxalate being the most common. Fluid analysis, protein electrophoresis, urinalysis, cytology prep, and vitreous eye fluids (necropsy) were other tests per - formed, bringing the total tests performed in the section for 2009 to 13,929. The section completes its testing on the same day as receipt with a few exceptions. Cryptosporidia and protein electrophore - sis tests require more time and are reported within five working days of receipt. The section personnel consists of 1.25 FTE. A section chief with a B.S., M.T . (ASCP) and over 30 years experience in veteri-nary and human diagnostic laboratory testing works full time. A part-time technician with a B.S. degree and four years' experi-ence completes the section. Other qualified LDDC personnel are available for backup and consultation. Epidemiology Jacqueline L. Smith The primary mission of the Epidemiology Section of the LDDC is to provide animal disease surveillance and early detec - tion of animal disease outbreaks, assist veterinarians in the inves - tigation of serious and unusual disease problems, and conduct relevant infectious disease research. The epidemiology program is driven by state-of-the-art electronic data-gathering systems that allow for near-real time analysis and distribution of diagnostic case information that will be useful to practitioners in treatment, prevention, and management of animal disease problems. We also provide in-depth field investigations to better char - acterize disease outbreaks by identifying causative etiology. At the request of any farm or producer in the state, and with the approval of the LDDC administration, collection of diagnostic specimens and recommended diagnostic testing are provided free of charge to Kentucky clientele. 2009 Highlights: Total research visits\u2014321/215.5 hours: Research farm visits: for R. equi\u2014180 (30 farms, 6 x each), approximately 30 minutes per farm plus drive time (90 hours of visits, 47 hours drive time logged)\u2014137 hours. Research farm visits (Crestwood) for R. equi\u2014 141 (47 foals, 3 x each) each approximately 30 minutes plus drive time (70.5 hours of visits, 8 hours drive time logged)\u201478.5 hours. Two surveys requiring 30 to 40 hours each for preparation, distribution, analysis, and follow-up on R. equi and customer satisfaction. Phone calls involving questions, suggestions, recommenda- tions\u2014112. Requests for statistics: (from LDDC faculty; UK faculty; state or federal officials; and local veterinarians )\u201419 (1 to 10 hours each). Requests for graphics: 8 (2 to 10 hours each). Reportable disease reports sent: 51 weekly reports (approxi- mately 1 hour each week). Molecular Diagnostics Stephen F . Sells Diagnostic PCR assays are being increasingly utilized because of their speed and specificity. Nucleic acid-based tests are now used so that unknown organisms can be identified, closely related organisms can be differentiated, and small numbers of pathogens can be detected in complex samples. Specimens such as blood, swabs, feces, etc. are accepted directly from clinicians and also from the pathology, virology, and bacteriology sections of this and other diagnostic facilities. 2009 Highlights: Approximately 4,750 specimens submitted for PCR testing. The most requested tests included equine herpesvirus type 1 and Moraxella bovis (50), and Mycoplasma bovis (65). This section continues to be responsible for providing the majority of Kentucky's arbovirus (mosquito-borne virus) testing for an environmental risk analysis program with the Kentucky Department for Human Health.14 In cooperation with researchers at Michigan State University, the normal flora of the genital tract of male donkeys is being determined. An important preliminary finding of this study is that T aylorella asinigenitalis , one of the bacteria causing contagious equine metritis, is sometimes a part of the normal flora of male donkeys and that it can persist for at least 12 months in these animals. An investigation was undertaken with researchers at the Gluck Equine Research Center to determine if the treatment of semen with antibiotics will prevent the transmission of T. equigenitalis to mares bred by artificial insemination. Pre- liminary results indicated that the antibiotics did prevent the transmission of the disease. In conjunction with the bacteriology section, we are using PCR methods for detecting Crossiella equi and Amycolatopsis spp. in equine placentas. These the primary cause of nocardioform placentitis in equine. Pathology Neil M. Williams The Pathology Section of the LDDC is composed of eight faculty pathologists, three post-doctoral scholars (pathology residents), four full-time necropsy technicians, four part-time necropsy student workers, and five histology technicians. The section performs complete necropsy examinations on submitted animals, histopathology on necropsy cases and surgical biopsies, and cytological examinations. As part of the comprehensive necropsy examination, additional laboratory tests are ordered by the pathologist case coordinator to aid in confirming a diag-nosis. The abnormal findings on necropsy are correlated with other laboratory tests, including microscopic examination of the tissues, and a comprehensive report is prepared for every pathology case. Necropsy: A postmortem examination (necropsy) is conducted to identify any pathologic changes in the tissues that would indicate disease, injury, or any other abnormal process result - ing in illness. Total Necropsy Cases 3,152 Avian 37 Bovine 829 Caprine 52 Equine 1,670 Ovine 49 Porcine 8 Small animal 464 Miscellaneous 43 Histopathology: Tissues are prepared and processed to produce glass slides for microscopic examination conducted by the patholo-gists. Tissues from the necropsy and surgical biopsy cases were processed and 32,771 microscopic slides produced. In addition to the routine hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections, special and immunohistochemical stains were done, resulting in 3,375 slides produced for the purpose of identifying microscopic organisms/agents that may cause disease or tissue antigens that define or identify cell structures. Biopsy: Abnormal areas or lesions are often removed surgically or biopsied from live animals and sent to the laboratory for de-termination of the type of process and recommended treatment and potential prognosis. These tissue specimens are processed, and microscopic slides are prepared for the pathologists to examine by microscopy. Tissue specimens representing 3,151 cases were processed and examined. A report with diagnosis was produced for each case. Cytology: Preparations of cells harvested from abnormal lesions or abnormal fluids are placed on microscopic slides and stained for examination under the microscope by the pathologists. Cytopathological examinations were performed, a diagnosis made, and a report generated for 141 cases. Quality Assurance/Quality Control Mary Harbour The goal of LDDC's Quality Assurance Program is continu- ous improvement of service to clients to ensure quality results. The design of the program is based on American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AA VLD) requirements, International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines, and Organization of International Epizootics (OIE) standards. The Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center Quality Program also helps fulfill the university's mission of improving service delivery while achieving excellent human relations (internally and externally), sound leadership, and effective communications. Besides the continuous improvement of service, the quality assurance section prepared the laboratory for AA VLD accredi-tation. The accreditation site visit occurred in May 2009, and, as noted earlier, for the first time the LDDC was given full AA VLD accreditation. The section will continue to monitor and update policies and procedures to meet the AA VLD requirements. The laboratory also became a part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), and the section will assist in implementing all policies and procedures involved. Serology Meg Steinman The Serology Section of the LDDC provides accurate and timely results for both diagnostic and regulatory testing. The results generated provide veterinarians and regulatory person-nel with data upon which to base their decisions. The section also performs numerous tests for movement of animals within the United States and for international export purposes. The section utilizes a variety of testing methodologies. In 2009, the section started screening for avian influenza by ELISA, allowing for a quicker turnaround time. The section continues to see the number of specimens from the poultry industry increase. Below is a sampling of the higher volume tests that are performed in this section.152009 Highlights: Tests done on multiple species: Leptospirosis\u20148,899 Brucella Toxicology Cynthia L. Gaskill The primary mission of the T oxicology Section of the LDDC is to provide toxicological diagnostic testing capabilities and consultations to Kentucky veterinarians, LDDC pathologists and pathology residents, county extension agents, livestock producers, and pet owners. A large variety of toxicological tests are available through the toxicology section, including assays for metals and minerals in tissues, feed, water, and soil; organic compounds including a multitude of pesticides, drugs, and other chemicals; biological toxins such as plant toxins, toxic insects, and bacterial and fungal toxins; and numerous other toxins. Con - sultation services include assistance with appropriate sample collection and submission recommendations, determination of appropriate tests to be performed, interpretation of analytical results, therapeutic advice, differential diagnoses, residue con-siderations, and other general toxicological information. 2009 Highlights: A student internship program was initiated between the section and the Eastern Kentucky University Forensic Sci-ences program. Our first intern completed her internship and remains employed as a part-time technician supported in part by the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority (KHEAA) work-study program. Installation of new, state-of-the-art analytical instrumenta- tion was completed. Instrumentation includes an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, a high-performance liquid chromato- graph, and an ion chromatograph, among other updates and improvements. Method development and validation for all new analytical test procedures has been initiated and is progressing smoothly. New quality control measures have been instituted to ensure results are accurate, reproducible, and meaningful. Several toxicological research projects are in progress in col- laboration with internal and external researchers. In 2009, the section received samples from more than 1,000 cases, with most cases involving multiple samples such as vari- ous tissues, forages, or other samples, often involving multiple animals and with multiple test requests per case. Due to the lack of unique test codes in the old LIMS system for many of the tests performed in the section, actual numbers of each test performed cannot be obtained by a computer data search. This problem has been corrected with the institution of the new LIMS system, and data retrieval will be dramatically improved in 2010. The most common tests requested include metal and mineral quantifica-tions in tissues such as liver and kidney; screening of rumen and stomach contents for organic compounds and drugs; analysis of tissues for pesticides; and evaluation of forages and feeds for nitrate content, mycotoxins, ionophores, cyanide, and other feed-related toxins. Virology Neil Williams The Virology Section of the LDDC provides diagnostic virol - ogy support to the laboratory pathologists, the Commonwealth and USDA veterinarians, and the livestock producers and pet owners of Kentucky and other states. 2009 Highlights: This section provides 40 different tests, including fluorescent antibody tests; serologic tests for detection of antibodies to viruses; virus isolation tests for cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, goats, cats, dogs, and birds; and tests for the detection of viral antigens. The section maintains 11 tissue culture cell lines that are used routinely. The section performed 29,170 tests during 2009. Of this total, 14,239 were virus neutralization tests for the detection of viral antibodies to meet regulatory requirements for the equine industry. Cattle producers have continued to utilize the screening test to detect animals persistently infected with bovine viral diar - rhea virus in their herds. The laboratory tested 8,632 animals this year. Identification and removal of affected animals help producers reduce illness, loss of production, and death of their herd animals and add value to one of our most important commodities.16Regulatory Services Mission The Division of Regulatory Services is committed to service and consumer protection of Kentucky citizens, businesses, and industries. Our programs monitor and analyze feed, fertilizer, milk, seed, and soil and are administered using a cooperative, science-based approach. The Division of Regulatory Services administers four state laws pertaining to the manufacturing, processing, labeling, and marketing of commercial feed, fertilizer, seed, and raw milk. The Division's primary objectives are to protect producers and other consumers from poor-quality, mislabeled, or misrepresented products and to protect agricultural and other businesses from unfair competition. Feed, fertilizer, and seed are monitored through manufactur - ing and retail channels for compliance. Label review and product and facility inspections as well as product sampling and analysis are important parts of this process. Raw milk is monitored dur - ing marketing to ensure an accurate and equitable exchange between dairy producers and processors and to ensure the integrity of milk from farm to processor. Regulatory inspectors and one auditor cover the state collect - ing samples, inspecting facilities, and auditing records. Audits of sales and fee payments were conducted on 319 of 382 feed, fertilizer, seed, and milk firms in Kentucky to verify reports, records, and fee payments. Two specialty product inspectors are dedicated to monitoring and sampling small package and specialty pet food, fertilizer, and seed products. One inspector is dedicated to the milk regulatory program: auditing records and monitoring activities of sampler-weighers, handlers, testers, and lab facilities. In addition to regulatory programs, service testing is provided through the seed, soil, and milk laboratories. These and other activi-ties in the Division are performed by a dedicated and professional staff who conduct laboratory analyses, provide computer support, process data, and compile reports in addition to various other du-ties necessary to carry out and administer effective programs. Feed Regulatory Program The feed regulatory program provides consumer protection for livestock feed and pet food according to provisions of the Kentucky Commercial Feed Law. The program ensures safety and suitability of animal feed in producing meat, milk, and eggs for human consumption and pet food products for adequately maintaining companion animals. The program monitors the marketplace environment and provides standards of quality, safety, efficacy, and labeling for feed products. A statewide inspection, sampling, and laboratory testing program moni-tors feed products and reviews labels. Labels are evaluated to identify purpose of feed, guaranteed composition, ingredient list, feeding directions, and the need for any warning or caution statements. The feed program participates in a nationwide food safety effort that promotes consumer confidence in the nation's food supply. We inspect facilities that manufacture, store, and retail feeds. We worked cooperatively with the Food and Drug Ad-ministration (FDA) in providing compliance with the ruminant-to-ruminant feeding ban to prevent the establishment and amplification of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow disease\"). 2009 Highlights: The inspectors collected 2,393 official samples, and others provided 57 unofficial samples to the laboratory that per - formed 15,714 analyses representing more than 2 million tons. These samples included 661specialty pet food samples analyzed by the laboratory. The laboratory provided analysis for crude protein and fat on 230 research samples. The laboratory monitored the 2009 grain crops for mycotox - ins, including analysis for aflatoxin, fumonisin, and vomitoxin in 46 corn, six barley, seven wheat, and five oat samples\u2014part of the more than 300 samples analyzed by the laboratory for mycotoxins. The laboratory conducted 75 BSE inspections for compliance with rules and inspected four feed mills that mix restricted drugs in feed for compliance of use and adequate records. The laboratory maintained registration on more than 18,000 products from almost 1,200 companies and conducted label reviews on more than 1,000 new products. Laboratory check samples for AOCS mycotoxins, AAFCO, AOCS microscopy, USDA grain, aflatoxin share sample pro- gram, and PCS phosphate were analyzed and reported. The laboratory provided feed program support using 43 different analytical methods. Cash receivables were substantiated on 2,995 feed reports. The income from fees and licenses received from July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009, was $1,156,537. Feed products are assessed at 35 cents/ton. Fertilizer Regulatory Program The Kentucky Fertilizer Law ensures that fertilizers sold in Kentucky are clearly and accurately labeled so that consumers can make informed purchases of fertilizer with confidence in its quality. The law also protects the legitimate fertilizer industry from unfair competition. 2009 Highlights: Administered actions on 2,475 official and 34 unofficial samples of fertilizer involving 7,890 chemical tests. The official samples represented about 44,412 tons out of the approximately 587,283 tons of fertilizer distributed in Kentucky during 2009, or about 7.5%. Reviewed labels and registered 3,152 products from 587 firms and issued licenses to 210 companies that manufactured custom-blended fertilizers.17 Analyzed laboratory check sample materials from Magruder\u00ae, UAN, AFPC phosphate rock, AFPC phosphate, and AFPC specials for the fertilizer regulatory program. Provided support for 30 different analytical methods. Substantiated cash receivables on 1,020 fertilizer reports. The income from fees and licenses received from July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009, was $543,994. Fertilizer products are assessed at 50 cents/ton. Milk Regulatory Program The mission of the milk regulatory program is to ensure raw farm milk produced and marketed in Kentucky is bought and sold using accurate weights and tests. The program's primary function is to monitor milk handling systems from the time a producer's milk is sampled and weighed through delivery and laboratory testing until producer payments are calculated. The program provides support to the producers and processors of Kentucky's $238 million/year dairy industry. Industry par - ticipants are trained, licensed, and subsequently monitored to maintain compliance with the law. In addition to regulatory functions, the milk program coop- erates with other agencies in educational projects to provide a variety of services to Kentucky dairy producers, processors, and allied industries. The milk program also operates a laboratory that is available for Kentucky producer, processor, and handler service testing. 2009 Highlights: Reviewed and issued licenses to three transfer stations, 23 milk handlers, 19 laboratories, 69 testers, and 348 sampler-weighers (milk-haulers, receivers, and samplers). Analyzed and administered action on 2,903 official sam- ples. Administered a monthly milk lab quality control check sample program through the distribution of 2,508 check samples to the 19 licensed laboratories to ensure accurate component testing procedures. Conducted 16 pay-record and 16 raw milk receiving manifest audits. Conducted 31 milk laboratory inspections. Collaborated with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health Services Milk Safety Branch to train sampler-weighers and processor receiving personnel. Trained and examined 40 new sampler-weighers and 14 new testers. Conducted 13 inspections of raw milk transfer stations. Conducted 363 sampler-weigher inspections. Participated with the Department of Biosystems and Agri- cultural Engineering (BAE) in two projects funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop and optimize an electronic security system for securing bulk milk during transport. Substantiated cash receivables on 92 milk reports. The income from fees and licenses received from July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009, was $194,403. Milk handlers and producers are assessed at 0.5 cents per 100 pounds. Seed Testing Laboratory The Division maintains the only seed testing facility in Ken- tucky. This laboratory conducts all official testing in the state and provides service testing for producers, dealers, retailers, researchers, and homeowners. In 2009, 95% of service samples accepted into the laboratory were submitted by Kentucky firms or individuals. Services to customers in 2009 included electronic notification of sample activity and reporting of test results as well as real-time online access to service sample test results. Laboratory capabilities include purity testing, weed and crop seed identification, seed counts, accelerated aging, test weight, fluorescence testing for ryegrass, moisture content, tetrazolium, herbicide tolerance, endophyte, germination, and many other tests. In 2009, seed treatment and trait testing capabilities offered by the laboratory were expanded. Laboratory analysts participated in regional and national referee testing through the Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA) and the USDA Federal Seed Laboratory to ensure inter-laboratory and intra-laboratory quality of test results. All analysts are AOSA-certified in their respective areas of analysis. More than 20,000 individual tests were performed by labora-tory personnel on more than 175 different crops in 2009. The program received $71,604 in income for service testing during the period July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009. Seed Regulatory Program The seed regulatory program ensures Kentucky farmers and urban consumers of quality seed while promoting fair and eq-uitable competition among seed dealers and seedsmen through inspection and analysis of products found in the marketplace. The Division, which administers and implements the Kentucky Seed Law, promotes compliance through facility inspections, sampling, and analysis of seed offered for sale. The law requires proper labeling of seed, which includes kind, variety, and lot designation; purity percentages; noxious weeds; origin; test date; and a germination guarantee. The Division is also responsible for maintaining registration of seed labelers, seed conditioners, and seed dealers in the state. 2009 Highlights: Performed inspections and sampled agricultural, lawn, turf, and garden seeds at more than 500 wholesale and retail loca-tions. Collected and tested 1,969 official seed samples. Issued stop-sale orders on 260 official seed samples and 338 violative seed lots at seed dealer and seed processor loca- tions. Cooperated with the USDA seed branch regarding shipments of seed into the state that were in violation of the Federal Seed Act. Reviewed and issued 195 agricultural permits and 41 veg- etable and flower permits to label seed.18 Registered 480 seed dealers and 24 noncertified custom conditioners. Provided training to firms on labeling requirements, retail sales procedures, stop-sale release procedures, and record- keeping requirements. Substantiated cash receivables on 794 seed reports. The income from fees, permits, and licenses received from July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009, was $369,960. Seed products are assessed at 4 to 24 cents per unit. Soil Testing Laboratory Soil testing provides farmers, homeowners, greenhouse op- erators, and others with scientific information about the fertility status of their soils or greenhouse media. In partnership with the Cooperative Extension Service, it also provides them with lime and fertilizer recommendations based on laboratory results. We also offer analyses of animal wastes, nutrient solutions, and special research solutions. The program received $217,978 in income for service testing during the period July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009. The soil test Web site is at http://soils.rs.uky.edu. The number of samples analyzed in 2009 were: 2009 Highlights: Type Number % Change Agriculture 40,335 -4 Home lawn and garden 10,652 33 Commercial horticulture 841 18 Greenhouse media 85 18 Research 7,173 -21 Atrazine residue in soil 31 72 Animal waste 334 -10 Nutrient solution 75 -10 Special research solutions 194 -82 Total 59,720 -3 Robinson Center for Appalachian Resource Sustainability At Quicksand in Breathitt County, Kentucky, the Robinson Center for Appalachian Resource Sustainability (RCARS) is the east region location for research on fruits and vegetables, ornamentals, livestock forages, grain crops, tobacco, and wood utilization. The Robinson Center is also the administrative headquarters of the Robinson Forest, which spreads over parts of Breathitt, Perry, and Knott counties and is the site of forestry, wildlife, surface mine reclamation, and watershed management research. In 2009, the RCARS was assigned responsibility for manag- ing the research facilities at Quicksand, the Wood Utilization Center, and the Robinson Forest. The new mission of this reorga-nized unit is to increase the long-term value-added, sustainable income, and sustainable flow of economic, ecological, and social goods and services from the lands, natural resources, and people of eastern Kentucky and the Appalachian Region. 2009 Research Activities Robinson Center RCARS is the east-region location for livestock forage variety and corn hybrid testing programs conducted by the Depart - ment of Plant and Soil Sciences. Results from these trials are published annually. RCARS is one of three sites devoted to soil fertility research in a no-tillage corn and soybean rotation involving comparisons of poultry litter and inorganic fertilizer, located at Quicksand. Extension faculty in the Department of Plant and Soil Sci- ences are studying nitrogen volatilization losses in no-till corn production on an eastern Kentucky alluvial soil. The environmental conditions resulting from the mountain- ous terrain in this region offer a unique opportunity for the study of plant disease issues in tobacco, fruit, and vegetable crops at this facility by faculty in the Department of Plant Pathology. Variety testing for fall tomato crops, ornamental corn, sweet corn, and sweet sorghum was conducted by extension horti-culture faculty. Results of these trials are published annually. Robinson Forest Research includes the following projects: Department of Entomology Evaluation of the micromechanical properties of the hemlock woolly adelgid feeding site, focusing on the point of adelgid stylet insertion and the evaluation of whether toughness or elasticity affects hemlock susceptibility. Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering Design of a headwater stream system for a head-of-hollow fill. Department of Forestry Avian and herpetological response to differing intensities of forest harvest in the Cumberland Plateau. Do post-mining constructed channels replace structural and functional characteristics of headwater streams in the eastern coalfields of Kentucky? Effect of crown release on tree grade and DBH growth of white oak sawtimber in eastern Kentucky. Effect of riparian zone width and disturbance on water quality and stream communities following forest harvest in eastern Kentucky watersheds. Evaluating spoil amendment use and mycorrhizal inoculation on reforestation success in the eastern and western Kentucky coalfields. 19Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems Working Group The Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems Working Group's mission is to create new knowledge to improve the sustainability of the food system in Kentucky and beyond, to help Kentucky citizens and students understand sustainable agriculture and food systems, and to promote UK's activities as they relate to sustainable agriculture and food systems within the land-grant mission. Inside the College of Agriculture, the group works across all departments to develop synergy between them, and its membership includes a member from every department within the College. Research Support and Activities UK Dining Services Dr. Gregg Rentfrow and Bob Perry worked with UK Dining Services to develop a \"Values-Based Value Chain\" to purchase whole cattle for use in the university dining halls and catering operations. The cattle are purchased directly from farmers who deliver them to a processor. After processing to the chef 's specifications, the beef is de-livered by another vendor directly to the food warehouse on campus. With this \"value chain, \" the producer, processor, and transportation provider are each paid separately, based on a fair profit margin for their individual operations. Each link in the chain agrees to work with the other links and hold prices steady and reasonable, based on their own operational needs. Dining Services obtains very high-quality 100% Kentucky beef, custom cut to its specifications, for a cost very near commodity beef costs. It is a win-win-win-win relationship that has the potential to directly impact the Kentucky farm and general economy at almost $2 million per year. Values-based value chains are also being researched for pork and other Kentucky agricultural products and are the cutting-edge vehicle in the food chain between direct and commodity sales. Small Farm Dairy UK Dining Services continues to utilize the all-natural and small-farm-produced milk from the Willis Schrock family at J.D. Country Milk. The working group, and especially Dr. Melissa Newman and Dr. Joe O'Leary of the Department of Animal and Food Sciences, have continued to work with this small family dairy as it has scaled up to meet increasing demand and develop new products such as fresh butter and buttermilk. Taste Panels Through the working group, taste panels continue to be very popular with some of Kentucky's and the nation's best chefs to taste new varieties of produce grown at the UK Horticulture Research Farm. The group also took part in the annual Horti-culture Field Day and has arranged tours for growers interested in starting organic production. Grassfed Beef The working group hosted the annual \"Grazing America\" conference of the American Grassfed Association and pro-vided many of the speakers for the event. Dr. Gregg Rentfrow conducted carcass demonstrations with beef, pork, and lamb that were the highest-rated portion of the conference. Meat Cutting 101 Based on the success of the demonstrations during the \"Graz - ing America\" conference, another carcass demonstration by Dr. Gregg Rentfrow was held for chefs and producers to great acclaim. Attendees were from Kentucky and surrounding states and included farmers, chefs, and food retailers. Due to the many requests to offer this demonstration again, there are two new programs in development. One will be specifically developed GPS and GIS analysis of mobile harvesting equipment and sediment delivery to streams during forest harvest operations on steep terrain. Landscape predictors of SVAP scores in Robinson Forest: A pilot study. Long-term effects of forestry best management practices on hydrology, water chemistry, and woody debris in three Ap-palachian headwater catchments. Temporary log skidder stream crossing. Timber harvesting analysis using GPS and GIS. Tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima) control. 2009 Extension Activities Forestry Extension organized and conducted a two-day work - shop in Jasper, Indiana, titled \"Wood Moisture and Stresses; Effects on Machining and Gluing. \" Forestry Extension organized and conducted three Shaker Box Workshops at the Wood Utilization Center in Jackson, Kentucky, to provide information and skills to 27 people in-terested in the history and craft of oval Shaker box making. \"Win with Wood\" is an annual youth program focused on forestry and the forest industry. A tooling design program was developed to train Kentucky manufacturers and entrepreneurs in the secondary wood industry on value-added moulder technology and use. A training program was designed to teach hands-on methods for moulder set-up and operations and profile knife grinding. This program teaches the secondary wood industry how to become more efficient in order to be able to compete nation-ally and globally. 2009 Teaching Activities Conducted at Robinson Forest NRC 320 - Field Experience in Data Collection T echniques FOR 375 - T axonomy of Forest VegetationFOR 376 - Silvicultural PracticesFOR 377 - Forest SurveyingFOR 378 - Forest MensurationFOR 379 - Harvest and Utilization of Wood20for farmers who direct-market their animals and aims to educate them on working with a processor. The second is a hands-on cutting program specifically for chefs who purchase whole lamb and pork carcasses for use in their restaurants. MarketMaker Members of the working group continue to be an integral part of the team developing Kentucky MarketMaker, an online searchable directory of all food products available in Kentucky. In direct response to the many questions fielded by the group from producers, Dr. Tim Woods and Bob Perry developed \"Re-tail and Restaurant Ready, \" an educational program for produc - ers to overcome many of the challenges when selling directly to restaurants and retail operations. Local Food Usage The trend of buying food directly from a farm, whether at a farmer's market or through a CSA subscription, continues to grow despite the economy of recent years. Members of the working group have fielded many questions on a wide range of topics in this area from producers, consumers, and processors. Members of the group are also called upon to serve as speakers and panelists at numerous conferences locally, nationally, and internationally. Local Food Network Hub The working group continues to serve as a network hub between UK researchers, specialists, and Cooperative Extension agents; other universities and colleges nationally and internationally; the Governor's Office of Agricultural Policy; the Kentucky Department of Agricul-ture; advocacy groups such as Chefs Collaborative, Slow Food USA, Partners for Family Farms, Community Farm Alliance, Sierra Club, the American Grassfed Association, and the Community Food Security Coalition; and, most important, the farmers/producers themselves. By facilitating communication among these various organizations, research opportunities are found, information to help producers is distributed, and UK's work in this area is highlighted in local, national, and international publications and media. Tracy Farmer Institute for Sustainability and the Environment The Tracy Farmer Institute for Sustainability and the Envi- ronment (TFISE) was officially established on July 1, 2009. Dr. Paul Bertsch, director of the Institute, and Dr. Carol Hanley, associate director, provide primary leadership for the Institute, which is administratively housed under the UK Office of the Vice President for Research, Dr. Jim Tracy. Prior to July 1, the Tracy Farmer Center for the Environment was under the stewardship of the College of Agriculture, which remains a key player in the TFISE. The integrated research agenda of the Institute is supported, developed, and implemented by the Faculty of the Environment (FoTE), a group of faculty from across campus representing 12 colleges and over 150 faculty members. Membership in the FoTE is open and voluntary with faculty self-selecting to be-come members. Individuals with interest in issues pertaining to sustainability, energy, and the environment from a science or policy perspective have joined the FoTE, regardless of their active participation in ongoing TFISE activities. The FoTE is supported by three communication tools: a faculty database, listserv, and Web site. The faculty database is linked to the Web site, and the listserv is used to distribute important information in a timely manner. The majority of the faculty who are on the listserv are in the expertise database. 2009 Research Activities Major accomplishments of the TFISE for 2009 include: Awarded $40,000 for Ph.D. Fellowships in Sustainable Sys- tems. Hosted numerous seminars on topics related to sustainability and the environment across campus. Co-hosted the Spotlight Conversation on Climate Change and the Green Breakfast with the Lexington/Fayette Urban County Government. Spring Symposium with the Center for Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior. Forum on Sustainable Manufacturing. Participated in the campuswide Big Blue Goes Green events. Sustainability in Marketing Colloquium. Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation Climate Change Conference. Submitted over $5 million in proposals for federal funding, resulting in a pending $2 million award for the U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency.21UK Research and Education Center at Princeton The University of Kentucky Research and Education Center (UKREC) at Princeton, Kentucky, holds a unique position as part of the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station and the Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service. The UKREC remains dedicated to sustaining the heritage of impact and achievement by these great institutions and the rapidly changing issues and challenges associated with them. Its vision is to be recognized at the local, state, and national level for excellence in agricultural research, education, leadership, and service to the Common-wealth. Established in 1925, the West Kentucky Substation at Prince- ton has functioned as a center of agricultural activities in western Kentucky. Great advancements have been made in Kentucky's leading industry\u2014agriculture\u2014with considerable progress be-ing made in improving utilization and conservation of resources, increasing yields of crops and livestock, better management of capital and labor, expanding markets, and finding solutions for problems facing rural people and communities. Increased returns to Kentucky farmers total millions of dollars annually just from the use of new production technologies resulting from research findings and educational programs of the College of Agriculture. The UKREC is fundamentally interdisciplinary, applying the biological and social sciences to challenges in agricultural, food, and environmental systems. Our scholarship encompasses hu-man and natural resources and their interaction. As part of the University of Kentucky, the UKREC: Facilitates lifelong learning, informed by scholarship and research. Expands knowledge through creative research and discovery. Serves Kentucky communities by distributing, sharing, and applying knowledge. The UKREC is the headquarters for more than 50 faculty and staff members representing eight different departments in the College. Its faculty and staff conduct research, provide diagnostic testing services, and develop educational programs on topics of concern to Kentucky farmers, agribusinesses, and families. The UKREC's Experiment Station Farm consists of almost 1,300 acres, including soils of both sandstone and limestone ori- gin, characteristic of soil types throughout the state. Researchers conduct approximately 100 different research/demonstration projects each year at the Experiment Station Farm or on farms in western Kentucky. Information derived from these projects or research conducted elsewhere is delivered to farmers and the general public through county offices of the Cooperative Exten-sion Service. Extension specialists located at the UKREC have expertise in a broad spectrum of food and agriculture topics. Service laboratories located at the UKREC provide informa- tion needed to make management decisions in the following areas: Soil testing enables farmers to develop nutrient management plans for growing crops. The Plant Disease Diagnostic Laboratory helps identify plant health problems and provides recommendations for disease prevention and control. Once insect and plant pests are identified, specialists can give advice on integrated pest management strategies to control them. The UKREC provides the Rottering-Kuegel Agricultural Research and Extension Building, which is available to large and small groups for classes and meetings in agriculture, family and consumer sciences, and 4-H. It is also used for a wide variety of meetings by government agencies, industry, and the general public. Each year there are approximately 450 different meetings held in this building, attended by about 14,000 people. Many of these visitors come from other states and foreign countries. Crops such as corn, wheat, soybeans, tobacco, fruits, veg- etables, and ornamentals are studied for ways to increase yields and income, improve handling and storage, protect the environment, and address other problems farmers may have. Research and education programs are also conducted in beef production. A beef herd consisting of 400 animals is involved in many different experiments and demonstrations. Agricultural engineering specialists conduct research and education programs related to both crop and livestock pro-duction. An aquaculture program is conducted in cooperation with Kentucky State University. A biennial field day and other commodity field days, attracting about 3,000 people, showcase the work of the Center. Visitors observe research, educational displays, and demonstrations representing work conducted at the Center and throughout the Commonwealth. Individuals and small groups are welcome to visit throughout the year to observe specific projects and talk with specialists.222009 Research Activities Grain Crops Soybean planting date Wheat row spacing Canola management No-till wheat management Soybean management verification program Horticulture Nursery/Landscape Landscape plant evaluations Landscape plant establishment based on production con- tainer Nursery crop production systems Container-type evaluation for sustainable production Efficient fertilization of nursery crops Maintaining water quality and efficient irrigation of nursery crops Kentucky native plant evaluation, production protocols, and utilization Development and maintenance of Kentucky provenance stock plants.
