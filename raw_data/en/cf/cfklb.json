These can range from mild to severe. It's important to follow your doctor's orders on how to use your pain medicine. If you have questions about side effects or about how much medicine to take, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Acetaminophen Acetaminophen helps many kinds of chronic pain. One brand name is Tylenol.

Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Other drugs that help with pain are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Examples include aspirin, ibuprofen naproxen (one Aleve). NSAIDs come in both prescription and over-the-counter forms. These medicines can be taken sometimes or every day. When taken regularly, they build up in the blood to fight inflammation (swelling) and give general pain relief. Always take NSAIDs with food or milk because the most common side effects are related to the stomach. Other side effects include: - Increased bruising - Risk of bleeding in the stomach - Kidney damage (when taken for long periods of time) - High blood pressure - Interference with blood pressure medicines If you take other pain medicines, do not take NSAIDs without talking to your doctor first.

Minor side effects may include: - Drowsiness - Nausea or vomiting - Restlessness - Dizziness - Loss of appetite - Weight gain - Itching or swelling Narcotics Doctors rarely prescribe narcotics or opioids to treat chronic pain. This is because they are highly addictive. Currently, there is an opioid crisis in the United States. People who become addicted can develop severe symptoms, such as increased pain, depression, or suicidal thoughts. They may begin to abuse other substances, or their behaviors could become harmful or violent. Addicts are at risk of misusing or overdosing on narcotics, which can cause death. Talk to your doctor about all risks of narcotics before starting a new medicine. If your doctor does prescribe a narcotic, be sure to follow their directions. Do not drive or operate heavy machinery when taking narcotics. Do not use alcohol. Tell your doctor if you have side effects from narcotics. These may include nausea, constipation, and trouble focusing or thinking clearly. Your doctor can prescribe an anti-nausea drug or laxative to help with side effects. When you're taking narcotics, it's important to remember the difference between physical dependence and psychological addiction. Physical dependence means that your body adjusts to a medicine and needs it to function. When you function has improved, your doctor will help you slowly and safely decrease the amount of medicine. Doing this helps prevent or reduce symptoms of withdrawal. It is critical to tell your doctor about these symptoms and work through the process together. Psychological addiction is the desire to use a drug whether or not it's needed to improve function and relieve pain. Using a narcotic this way is harmful to your health. Talk to your doctor if you think you are addicted to narcotics. They may give you other medicines to help your addiction. They could lower the dose, change to another drug, or stop the medicine. They may recommend counseling or rehab as well. Things to consider Always tell your doctor what other drugs you take. This includes medicines, vitamins, and supplements. The doctor also should know about all ongoing health conditions. Some medicines may not be safe to take. Do not start a new drug without your doctor's approval.
