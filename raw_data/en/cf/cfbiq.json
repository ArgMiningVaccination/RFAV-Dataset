Learn How Biofeedback Can Help Improve Your Health Improving the awareness of body sensations is key to making a change in our health. Biofeedback aids the user to become more aware of how life influences our health and well-being. Chronic nervous system activation through classic stressors, triggers, trauma, and day-to-day living, can consume our attention and focus, and we soon lose a sense of control of our senses. Maybe our heart pumps faster or harder, our mind races on thoughts of the day, or tension in our body that becomes more than we can handle. Learn how you can regulate your own nervous system with providers coaching our Biofeedback Clinic in Seattle. Utilizing biofeedback sensors including heart rate, respiration, muscle tension, sweat response, and temperature, we can increase our awareness of when we are stressed or relaxed. In turn, helping us understand how our body is responding to stress and how it fits with other symptoms or diseases, we are addressing. Dr. Kathy Severson speaks about the Mind Body Medicine & Biofeedback training offered in Ballard Seattle Examples of How Biofeedback Sensors Improve Various Health Conditions - Heart Rate Monitor - Hypertension, palpitations, general stress response - Respiration Sensor - anxiety, asthma, IBS, Hypertension - Temperature Sensor - cold hands or feet, raynauds, IBS - Sweat Response - Nervousness, anxiety, mind racing - Muscle Tension Sensor - Chronic Pain, Headaches, migraines Biofeedback Practitioners Rebel Med NW biofeedback practitioners provide an integrative approach to build awareness about your stress response and use Biofeedback to improve your emotional intelligence and your stress resiliency, so we can all have better relationships with ourselves, our co-workers, and our partners. Biofeedback Training is a technique that involves measuring and providing information about physiological processes in the body to help individuals learn how to control those processes voluntarily. It is a form of self-regulation training that aims to improve physical and mental health by increasing awareness and control over bodily functions such as your response to stress, your digestive function, your ability to sleep, or practice more mindful moments in your day. During a biofeedback session, various sensors are attached to the individual's body to monitor physiological responses such as heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, skin temperature, and respiration. The sensors detect and convert these signals into visual, auditory, or tactile feedback that the individual can perceive via computer screen while we active practice Cognitive behavioral therapy and other mindfulness based forms of counseling. By observing this feedback, individuals gain insight into their body's responses and learn to recognize subtle changes that may be associated with stress, anxiety, pain, or other conditions. With practice, they can develop techniques to consciously influence these physiological processes, promoting relaxation, stress reduction, and overall well-being. We take it a step further as a strategy to help optimize many primary care health concerns including High Blood Pressure or Hypertension, IBS or Irritable Bowel Syndrome, SIBO or Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or as one of primary skill based treatments for treating anxiety, depression, or PTSD. Biofeedback is commonly used in many of the primary care conditions listed above, but we also find It can also be helpful for performance enhancement in sports & sports psychology, and optimizing mental focus for individuals with ADD or ADHD. It's important to note that FDA approved biofeedback equipment is recommended as performed at Rebel Med NW with the Nexus 10 Biofeedback system. Dr. Andrew Simon is Board Certified for example from the BCIA, and maintains regular credentialing. When performed one on one with a naturopathic physician, we educate both the psychology principles present as well as the physiology principles at play when we interpret the data and guide the individual in developing appropriate strategies for self-regulation. Biofeedback Structure Biofeedback Training Initial Recommendations: - For most introductory conditions we recommend about 5-6 trainings with Biofeedback over the course of 2-3 months. - Biofeedback is similar to Physical Therapy in that we want to help you train your nervous system to regulate in a new way, just like learning a new exercise. - Biofeedback visits work best when you are ready to practice at least 20 minutes a day, either in 2 x 10 minute sessions or as part of the practice when you are mindful of your environment. Biofeedback Training Advanced Recommendations: - Many you are already familiar with the process of meditation and self regulation practice, previously learned in counseling, class, or workshop. - When performed in combination with counseling, somatic bodywork, or other mental health therapeutics, Biofeedback can be an optimizer for your ability to introspect and unluck deeper traumas, as you learn to regulate your nervous system more between the fight & flight or rest & digest parts of your nervous system. - Pairs well in sessions when seeking out [Acupuncture](https://rebelmednw.com/services/chinese-eastern-medicine/acupuncture-moxibustion/), Craniosacral, or trauma informed somatic body practitioner. - Consider [Virtual Reality Exposure therapy](https://rebelmednw.com/services/biofeedback-mind-body-medicine/virtual-reality-exposure-therapy/)or EMDR as adjunctive and compatible therapies when practicing biofeedback training.
