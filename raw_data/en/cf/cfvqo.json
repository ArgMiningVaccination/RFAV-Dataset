Last updated on Nov 21, 2022. Clinical Overview Use There is limited evidence supporting a role for vitamin E supplementation in treating or preventing cancer, CNS diseases (eg, Parkinson disease, epilepsy, Down syndrome), liver diseases, macular degeneration and cataracts, menopause, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis; data are often insufficient or conflicting. Various guidelines state that results data regarding the use of vitamin E in cardiovascular disease and in diabetes are conflicting. Evidence of potential harm with supplementation exists and must be considered and balanced with potential therapeutic benefits. Dosing The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin E (natural form) in adults is 15 mg (22.4 units). Currently, vitamin E is most commonly dosed in international units, which measure biological activity instead of quantity. However, by 2021 under the FDA's new labeling regulations for dietary supplements, vitamin E will be dosed in milligrams only. Most supplements contain only alpha-tocopherol, although some \"mixed\" products containing other tocopherols and tocotrienols are available. Synthetic supplements of vitamin E (all rac-alpha-tocopherol labeled as \"DL-\" or \"dl-alpha-tocopherol\") are only half as active as the same amount (by weight in mg) of the natural form (RRR-alpha-tocopherol, labeled as \"D-\" or \"d-alpha-tocopherol\"). To convert from mg to units: 1 mg of alpha-tocopherol=1.49 units of the natural form or 2.22 units of the synthetic form To convert from units to mg: 1 unit of the natural form=0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol 1 unit of the synthetic form=0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol Vitamin E doses up to 1,000 mg/day (1,500 units/day of natural or 1,100 units/day of synthetic) in adults appear to be safe. However, this is based on limited data and evidence from small studies of individuals receiving at least 2,000 units/day for a few weeks or months. Contraindications Use should be avoided in patients with bleeding disorders due to increased bleeding risks associated with vitamin E. Pregnancy/Lactation Studies have demonstrated that vitamin E supplementation does not reduce the risk for pre-eclampsia, still birth, neonatal death, preterm birth, or intrauterine growth restriction. However, a Cochrane review suggests a possible association between vitamin E and reduced risk for placental abruption; further studies are needed. These findings, coupled with the conflicting evidence regarding a relationship between vitamin E supplementation and mortality risk in the literature will need to be considered when determining whether to supplement with vitamin E beyond the recommended daily intake during pregnancy. Interactions See Drug Interactions section. Adverse Reactions Low-dose vitamin E supplementation (150 mg/day) does not appear to be associated with any serious adverse reactions. High levels of vitamin E can adversely affect the absorption of vitamins A and K. Long-term use of high doses may cause nausea, diarrhea, blurred vision, and prolonged bleeding time. Topical vitamin E may cause contact dermatitis, itching, and rash. Toxicology Vitamin E is a known antioxidant. However, studies have shown that vitamin E may be pro-oxidant in certain circumstances, causing oxidation and consequent damage to cells. Conflicting data exist regarding vitamin E supplementation and increased mortality. An increase in the risk for prostate cancer has been suggested in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT). Source Vitamin E can be found naturally in foods such as nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, and green leafy vegetables, or can be synthetically produced. It addition, vitamin E can be added to food, such as fortified cereals, and is available as a dietary supplement. [NIH 2018](#NIH.2018) Alpha-tocopherol is the only form recognized as meeting human requirements and is the most abundant form found in human plasma. In the American diet, the most common form of vitamin E is gamma-tocopherol, present in foods such as soybean, canola, and vegetable oils. [El Hadi 2018](#29337849), [NIH 2018](#NIH.2018) History Vitamin E was discovered in 1922 by Dr. Herbert Evans and his assistant Katherine Bishop when they observed in utero deaths of pups in pregnant rats receiving a special semipurified diet. When the diet was changed to lettuce and wheat germ, the rats delivered healthy pups. Recognizing that something was lacking in the diet, they termed the missing compound \"Factor X,\" which would later become known as vitamin E. [ANA 2018](#ANA.2018), [Evans 1922](#17838496) A pure fraction was chemically identified in 1938 and named \"tocopherol\" after the Greek words tocos meaning \"child Mattill and Harold Saft Olcott in discovering vitamin E's antioxidant properties. [Niki 2012](#3183290) In the 1980s and 1990s, the various forms of vitamin E were noted to act as signaling and gene regulation compounds. [Galli 2017](#27816611) Chemistry Vitamin E is a generic term for a group of 8 compounds, including 4 tocopherol and 4 tocotrienol derivatives. Tocopherols and tocotrienols occur in alpha, beta, gamma, and delta isomers in naturally occurring vitamin E, based on the methyl and hydroxyl substitutions in their phenolic rings. Vitamin E contains a chromanol double ring with a hydroxyl group (to reduce free radicals) and a hydrophobic side structures involves the phytyl tail they all have; tocotrienols have 3 double bonds in this tail while tocopherols do not. [ANA 2018](#ANA.2018), [Mathur 2015](#26272221) Vitamin E is fat-soluble, with perhaps the most important chemical characteristic being its antioxidant property. Alpha-tocopherol in supplements is typically esterified to preserve its shelf life. [NIH 2018](#NIH.2018) Tocotrienols are poorly water soluble, possess low chemical stability, and are quickly metabolized. [Savitskava 2016](#27677550) Uses and Pharmacology Note: When information regarding the specific vitamin E form (natural vs synthetic) used in a clinical study is available, the form is noted in the following data. Vitamin E has been extensively studied for several decades; a large number of clinical trials and animal experiments have been conducted. Vitamin E exerts its antioxidant effects through inhibiting production of reactive oxygen species formed from fat oxidation. Additionally, it is involved in cell signaling and regulation of gene expression. Alpha-tocopherol blocks protein kinase C (PKC) activity, impacting the proliferation and differentiation of cells in smooth muscle, platelets, and monocytes.( [Dennehy 2010](#20580500), [NIH 2018](#NIH.2018)) Tocotrienols are associated with and anti-inflammatory properties compared to alpha-tocopherol.( [Peh 2016](#26706242)) This is due to tocotrienols being more uniformly distributed across the lipid membrane, the presence of double bonds on its isoprenoid side chain leading to more free radical interaction, and higher efficiency of redox cycling.( [Chin 2018](#30186176)) Vitamin E also enhances the release prostacyclin, promoting vasodilation and reducing platelet aggregation.( [Dennehy 2010](#20580500)) It has been suggested to exert pro-oxidant effects in the absence of co-antioxidants such as vitamin C and in cases of a constant low-level flux of free radicals.( [El Hadi 2018](#29337849)) Conflicting findings regarding associations between vitamin E supplementation and increased mortality risk and cancer risk (ie, prostate cancer) warrant judicious use of vitamin E. Mortality risk Clinical data Conflicting data exist regarding the relationship between vitamin E supplementation and mortality risk. One study found the pooled all-cause mortality risk difference with high-dose vitamin E (ie, doses more than 400 units/day) to be 39 per 10,000 persons (95% CI, 3 to 74; P=0.035). However, different findings were noted with low-dose vitamin E, with a risk difference of 16 per 10,000 persons (95% CI, 41 to 10; P>0.2).( [Miller 2005](#15537682)) Around the time this study was published, results from the Women's Health Study, in which natural-source vitamin E supplementation was given as 600 units every other day, were also published. The investigators found that while vitamin E had no significant impact on the incidences of myocardial infarction, stroke, or total mortality, there was a 24% risk reduction in cardiovascular mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59 a Cochrane meta-analysis of all randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of antioxidant supplements on primary and secondary disease prevention found that antioxidants had no significant effect on all-cause mortality (78 trials; RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.05); however, there was a significant increase in mortality in a fixed-effect model (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.05). Supplementation with vitamin E alone in trials with a low risk of bias showed increased mortality (46 trials; RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1 to 1.05).( [Bjelakovic 2012](#22419320)) Another meta-analysis that included 57 trials of 246,371 subjects and 29,295 all-cause deaths found no effect on all-cause mortality with vitamin E (overall RR, 1; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.02).( [Abner 2011](#21235492)) neuron disease Clinical data A 2017 Cochrane review found that vitamin E was associated with little to no effect on cramps associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (low-quality evidence).( [Ng 2017](#2807290)) Asthma Clinical data The updated British guideline on the management of asthma (2019) indicates that no intervention studies are available to make any recommendations on maternal dietary supplementation with vitamin E as an asthma prevention strategy. Additionally, results from intervention studies suggest that vitamin E supplementation is not associated with clinical benefits in people with asthma.( [SIGN 2019](#SIGN.2019)) Atopic eczema/dermatitis Clinical data A 2012 Cochrane review identified 2 randomized clinical trials evaluating vitamin E for atopic eczema/dermatitis that met criteria for analysis. A reduction in lichenification and dryness was noted with vitamin E monotherapy (600 units of alpha-tocopherol) in 52 adults and children older than 13 years. Additionally, vitamin D (cholecalciferol 1,600 units) and vitamin E combination therapy resulted in a difference in severity scores at the end of a 60-day treatment period, as well as improvements in pruritus and erythema compared with placebo. Vitamin D supplementation alone did not provide significant benefit over placebo in any of the measured outcomes. No differences in mean disease severity scores were observed in 60 adults treated with vitamin E plus selenium.( [Bath-Hextall 2012](#22336810)) In another study, vitamin E 400 units/day for 4 weeks was associated with improvements in itching and extent of lesions in patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis compared with placebo. Vitamin E supplementation did not impact sleeplessness.( [Jaffary 2015](#26941808)) Cancer Vitamin E has been investigated for its cytotoxic effects. It can decrease the free radical levels in tumor cells, cause cell cycle arrest, and ultimately inhibit proliferation, promote apoptosis, suppress angiogenesis, and increase immune system functioning to eliminate tumor cells.( [Savitskaya 2016](#27677550)) The anticancer effects of tocotrienol are independent of its antioxidant effects. Delta- and gamma-tocotrienol, 2 isomers with less antioxidant properties, have greater anticancer effects. Decreasing the methyl groups on the chromanol head leads to increased antiproliferative potency of tocotrienol (delta-tocotrienol>gamma-tocotrienol>beta-tocotrienol>alpha-tocotrienol). Tocotrienol has also [Chin 2016](#27671814), known as vitamin E succinate, has been investigated as a promising chemotherapeutic compound because it is able to selectively induce apoptosis (through the mitochondrial pathway) and inhibit proliferation in tumor cells while sparing normal cells and tissues.( [Savitskaya 2016](#27677550)) Animal and in vitro data Animal studies have suggested that delta-tocotrienol and gamma-tocotrienol accumulate in tumors.( [Chin pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma stem-like cells as well of gemcitabine-resistant PDAC human stem-like cells.( [Husain 2017](#28404939)) Clinical data Despite epidemiological studies suggesting favorable outcomes with vitamin E supplementation in reducing the risk of cancer and death from cancer, meta-analyses of SELECT study, synthetic vitamin E 400 units/day increased the risk for prostate cancer (HR, 1.17; 99% CI, 1.004 to 1.36; P=0.008).( [Klein 2011](#21990298)) However, in the Women's Health Study, natural vitamin E 600 units on alternate days did not increase the risk of cancer or death from cancer, nor did it increase total mortality.( [Buring 2006](#16970138)) Topical vitamin E has demonstrated improvement in oral mucositis caused by chemotherapy/radiation.( [Chaitanya 2017](#28658926)) Mucositis associated with chemotherapy may be alleviated with topical vitamin E through its ability to regulate Nrf2 activation. Topical vitamin E is preferred over oral administration based on clinical findings.( [Thomsen 2018](#30136590)) A meta-analysis that included 6 clinical trials involving 353 patients found that, in general, vitamin E was not associated with reducing the incidence of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.17 to The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline update for prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (2020) recommends that clinicians not offer vitamin E for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in adults with cancer undergoing treatment with neurotoxic agents (Intermediate; Moderate).( [Loprinzi 2020](#32663120)) Cardiovascular disease Vitamin E's potential benefits in cardiovascular disease span beyond its antioxidant effects. Anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects have been suggested; antiplatelet effects are the result of vitamin E's inhibition of PKC. Additionally, both alpha- and gamma-tocopherol enhance oxide to increase nitric oxide levels. Tocotrienol, but not tocopherol, may be an inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, specifically through inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl [Rashidi 2017](#27966778)) Gamma-tocotrienol has been associated with stimulating the degradation of apolipoprotein. Both delta- and gamma-tocotrienol influence gene expression involved in reduces via inhibition It also enhances nitric oxide production.( [Mathur 2015](#26272221)) Animal data In a study of pregnant mice exposed to high-dose formaldehyde, vitamin E 0.1 mcg reversed apoptosis in cardiomyocytes of maternal mice and the offspring.( [Wu 2017](#28966308)) In another murine study, the combination of vitamin E and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduced fine particulate matter-induced cardiovascular injury and decreased production of inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6). Antioxidant activity was also increased with agents.( [Du 2017](#28104476)) Supplementation with pure tocotrienol produced lipid-lowering effects in rabbits with established (ie, 8 weeks) atherosclerosis but not in those with early (ie, 2 weeks) atherosclerosis. Tocotrienol treatment also reduced expression of adhesion molecules and IL-6 expression in both groups.( [Rahman 2016](#27799085)) In a study of obese rats, alpha-tocopherol and alpha-, gamma- and delta-tocotrienol reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and improved contractility; however, only delta- and gamma-tocotrienol improved heart structure and normalized blood pressure.( [Wong 2017](#26446095)) Clinical data Data regarding the use of vitamin E for cardiovascular disease outcomes and related mortality are conflicting. Older epidemiological studies have suggested an association between vitamin E intake and reduced coronary heart disease and associated death.( [Kushi 1996](#8602181), [Rimm 1993](#8479464), [Stampfer 1993](#8479463)) In a and women with hypercholesterolemia, supplementation with tocotrienols from 3 different sources and dosed at 200 mg/day did not have any effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors.( [Mustad 2002](#12450888)) In smokers 50 years of age or older, ultrasound showed no effect on atherosclerosis after 5 years of natural vitamin E supplementation.( [Magliano 2006](#16926662)) In the Women's Antioxidant and Cardiovascular Study, no impact from supplementation (natural vitamin E 600 units every other day) on total mortality was observed in women at high risk for cardiovascular events, but a marginal effect was reported in women with a previous cardiovascular event.( [Cook 2007](#17698683)) A null effect was documented in another study evaluating vitamin E supplementation, with increased mortality in certain disease groups and a reduced risk in others.( [Hayden 2007](#17275460)) Results from the Women's Health Study showed that supplementation with natural vitamin E 600 units every other day had no significant impact on the incidences of myocardial infarction, stroke, or total mortality; however, there was a 24% risk reduction in cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.98; P=0.03).( [Lee 2005](#15998891)) A 2015 meta-analysis evaluated the effects of vitamin E alone and in combination with vitamin C on endothelial function. The investigators reviewed 27 trials (N=742) evaluating vitamin E alone and found a significant improvement in endothelial function with vitamin E (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.72; P=0.0001). However, there was significant heterogeneity among the trials. A subgroup analysis revealed beneficial effects of vitamin E in participants who had lower baseline vitamin E concentrations (ie, less than 20 mcM). A negative correlation between baseline vitamin E concentration and vitamin E supplementation on endothelial function was demonstrated. The combination of vitamin E and vitamin C was not associated with an improvement in endothelial function study of 39,815 initially healthy women at least 45 years of age and who were enrolled in the Women's Health Study, the impact of natural vitamin E 600 units every other day on heart failure risk was evaluated. During a median of 10.2 years, 220 heart failure events occurred. When adjusting for aspirin use, beta-carotene administration, and age, vitamin E did not significantly affect the risk for heart failure (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.21; P=0.59). The authors concluded that vitamin E did not impact the overall risk of heart failure in a generally healthy population of women.( [Chae 2012](#22438520)) In a large study including 23,099 Japanese men and 35,597 Japanese women, gender-specific effects on heart failure-associated mortality were evaluated based on dietary intake of vitamins A, D, E, and K. A reduced risk of heart failure mortality was noted in women but not men with dietary intake of vitamin E.( [Eshak 2018](#29429535)) Vitamin E has been investigated for a role in prevention of atrial fibrillation, potentially due to its anticoagulant effects (ability to lower activation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors) and due to its antiatherosclerotic properties. Data suggest that low serum vitamin E levels are related to the recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Conflicting results exist for vitamin E in the setting of postoperative atrial fibrillation.( [Orenes-Pi\u00f1ero 2015](#27412960)) Given the conflicting results regarding the effects of vitamin E on cardiovascular outcomes and associated mortality, the American Heart Association does not support the routine use of antioxidants in individuals with cardiovascular disease.( [Kris-Etherton 2004](#15289389)) Additionally, the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guideline for the management of peripheral artery disease (2005/2011) states that vitamin E is not recommended for treatment of patients with intermittent claudication (level C evidence).( [Anderson 2013](#23457117)) CNS effects Neurodegeneration/Alzheimer disease/Mild cognitive impairment Oxidative stress is linked to Alzheimer disease and other states of cognitive impairment, and vitamin E has been studied for its antioxidant activity in these populations. Specifically, amyloid-beta plaques, hallmarks of Alzheimer disease, cause oxidative stress, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species and associated lipid peroxidation.( [Gugliandolo 2017](#29168797)) Tocotrienol is believed to exert neuroprotective effects through scavenging free radicals, reducing the generation of free radicals, and improving mitochondrial function. Because high cholesterol has been implicated in Alzheimer disease, tocotrienol may be beneficial due to its effects on cholesterol production.( [Chin 2018](#29987193)) Animal and in vitro data In vitro data have demonstrated that vitamin E prevents amyloid-beta-induced oxidation, generation of reactive oxygen species, and neurotoxicity. Additionally, animal studies evaluating alpha-tocopherol have shown beneficial effects such as reductions in memory, cognitive deficits, and oxidative stress.( [Gugliandolo 2017](#29168797)) A tocotrienol-rich fraction dosed at 60 mg/kg/day for 10 days inhibited the formation of amyloid-beta fibrils and amyloid-beta oligomers in vitro and improved cognitive function in an amyloid-beta PPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic Alzheimer disease mouse model.( [Ibrahim 2017](#27716672)) In rats, vitamin E administration ameliorated the effects of long-term lead exposure on animal behavior, based on analysis using a passive avoidance learning and memory task test; effects may be due to vitamin E's antioxidant effects.( [Khodamoradi 2015](#25777497)) Clinical data In a 2017 Cochrane review, the authors concluded that vitamin E supplementation did not prevent progression to dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment, nor did it improve cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment or in those with Alzheimer disease. One study showed vitamin E supplementation may be beneficial in slowing functional decline in patients with Alzheimer disease. Additionally, supplementation with vitamin E did not appear to result in increased mortality or adverse effects.( [Farina 2017](#28418065)) The Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease by Vitamin E and Selenium (PREADViSE) primary prevention trial enrolled 3,786 of the 7,450 men from the parent prostate cancer prevention study (SELECT). Depending on the particular analysis, hazard ratios for dementia incidence over a 7-year period ranged from 0.8 to 0.97 for vitamin E alone and 0.97 to 1.18 for the combination of selenium plus vitamin E.( [Kryscio 2017](#28319243)) The Vitamin E and Memantine in Alzheimer's Disease trial assessed the effects of synthetic alpha-tocopherol (2,000 units/day), memantine (20 mg/day), or a combination of the two compared with placebo on mild to moderate Alzheimer disease progression in patients taking an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. A slower rate of decline was noted in patients receiving alpha-tocopherol over a mean period of 2.27 years compared with placebo. This translated to a delay in symptoms by 19% (approximately 6.2 months) in those receiving alpha-tocopherol. This effect was not noted in patients in the memantine group or memantine plus alpha-tocopherol combination group. The authors stated the lack of response with memantine was consistent with previous studies showing negative findings in mild dementia. However, it is unclear why the alpha-tocopherol plus memantine combination group did not demonstrate some level of benefit consistent with the alpha-tocopherol alone group. An increased rate of mortality associated with vitamin E was not observed.( [Dysken 2014](#24381967)) In a 2015 meta-analysis, high vitamin E or vitamin C intake was found to attenuate the risk for Alzheimer disease by about 26% (grade I evidence); however, no effect was noted with the combination of vitamins E and C (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.04).( [Xu 2015](#26294005)) A 2017 review of 5,269 subjects from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging found an age-adjusted risk reduction of 32% (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.92) in those receiving vitamin E supplements for cognitive impairment with no dementia; a risk reduction of 46% (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.85) for Alzheimer and risk reduction of 47% (HR, 0.53; 0.36 to 0.78) for 2018 systematic review (3 trials; N=12,830) found moderate-strength evidence suggesting that vitamin E was no different than placebo in preventing cognitive decline, as measured by brief cognitive performance tests, a multidomain neuropsychological performance test, and memory tests.( [Butler 2018](#29255909)) Several guidelines have been published regarding vitamin E use in Alzheimer disease and dementia. The European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines on the management of Alzheimer disease (2010) state there is insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin E for primary prevention of dementia and it should not be used in treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, the guidelines state that vitamin E should not be used in the treatment of Alzheimer disease (level A recommendation).( [Hort 2010](#20831773)) The British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) consensus statement on clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs (2016) states that type IA evidence shows vitamin E is not effective in reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer disease and that supplementation is not recommended for prevention or treatment of Alzheimer disease.( [O'Brien 2017](#28103749)) The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameter for the management of mild cognitive dementia states vitamin E is possibly ineffective in preventing the progression to Alzheimer disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment, and efficacy of the combination of vitamin E and vitamin C in patients with mild cognitive impairment is uncertain.( [Petersen 2018](#29282327)) The American Psychiatric Association (APA) guideline watch for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer disease and other dementias (2014) did not find enough definitive new evidence to change the 2007 guideline recommendation stating alternative agents, including vitamin E, are generally not recommended due to uncertain efficacy and safety.( [Rabins 2014](#Rabins.2014)) Recognizing differences in findings from clinical trials, consideration should be given to the formulations of vitamin E studied. A combination of tocopherols and not a specific tocopherol such as alpha-tocopherol (most commonly studied) may exert a larger neuroprotective effect in patients with Alzheimer disease.( [Gugliandolo 2017](#29168797)) Additionally, in light of the variable conclusions, it might be important to better understand a patient's vitamin E levels and oxidative stress patterns to help guide treatment decisions.( [Cervantes 2017](#28672782)) Down syndrome Because oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome, the antioxidant effects of vitamin E supplementation have been evaluated.( [Shichiri 2011](#21447382)) Animal data In a mouse model of Down syndrome, long-term supplementation with alpha-tocopherol was associated with improvements in cognitive deficits and reduction of lipid peroxidation.( [Shichiri 2011](#21447382)) Clinical data Supplementation with vitamin E 1,000 units twice daily for 3 years did not slow progression of cognitive deterioration in aging patients (ie, 50 years and older) with Down syndrome.( [Sano 2016](#27164691)) In children and teenagers with Down syndrome, vitamin E 400 mg plus vitamin C 500 mg daily for 6 months reduced oxidative stress.( [Parisotto 2014](#24685938)) These participants were further studied, with antioxidant effects still noted up to 1 year after discontinuation of antioxidant therapy.( [Parisotto 2015](#26207872)) In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-year trial of 53 patients with Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease-type dementia, the effects of a combination of alpha-tocopherol 900 units, alpha lipoic acid (ALA) 600 mg, and ascorbic acid 200 mg did not improve cognitive function or stabilize cognitive decline. No serious adverse effects were noted.( [Lott 2011](#21739598)) In a randomized controlled trial (N=93), supplementation with alpha-tocopherol 400 units/day for 4 months significantly urinary concentrations of the oxidative stress biomarker 8=hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) in children with Down syndrome compared with placebo (P<0.01). Because Down syndrome children have higher baseline levels of oxidative stress than their siblings, the authors suggested that alpha-tocopherol supplementation may reduce oxidative stress at the DNA level.( [Nachvak 2014](#24939437)) Epilepsy Animal data In a rat model of kainite-induced status epilepticus, a diet enriched with natural alpha-tocopherol for 2 weeks was associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.( [Betti 2011](#21749318)) Clinical data A Cochrane review of trials from 1966 through 2006 discusses poor trial methodology and did not show sufficient evidence to support routine use of vitamin E in the management of epilepsy.( [Ranganathan 2005](#15846704)) However, a more recent study demonstrated that vitamin E 400 units/day for 6 months in patients with epilepsy and receiving long-term antiepileptic drug therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the frequency of seizures (P<0.001) and improved electroencephalogram findings (P=0.001).( [Mehvari 2016](#27099849)) Parkinson disease Animal data In a study of rotenone-induced Parkinson disease in rats, coadministration of intramuscular vitamin E (every other day) ameliorated changes in total locomotor activity and catalepsy and decreased lipid peroxidation following 35 days of treatment.( [Sharma 2013](#24167416)) Clinical data In a population-based cohort study conducted in Sweden, dietary intake of vitamin E was evaluated in 84,774 patients. After a mean follow-up of 14.9 years, 1,329 cases of Parkinson disease were identified. The findings suggested that dietary intake of vitamin E was associated with a lower risk of developing Parkinson disease in women but not men (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96; Ptrend=0.02). The gender differences might be explained by antioxidant (ie, protective) effects of estrogen in women.( [Yang 2017](#28881039)) In a study of patients with Parkinson disease, a combination of vitamin E 400 units plus 1,000 mg of omega-3 fatty acids for 12 weeks resulted in improvements in Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Stage, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, total antioxidant capacity, and glutathione concentrations, as well as markers of insulin metabolism.( [Taghizadeh 2017](#28342967)) Tardive dyskinesia Animal data In a study of rats with haloperidol-induced tardive dyskinesia, vitamin E 20 mg/kg/day given orally for 5 weeks was associated with improvements in measures of tardive dyskinesia.( [Shi 2016](#27264436)) Clinical data A 2018 Cochrane systematic review analyzed the effects of vitamin E in 13 clinical trials enrolling 478 participants experiencing antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia.

A number of older clinical trials found no effect of vitamin E on clinical trials found that vitamin E supplementation improved blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), as well as enhanced antioxidant capacity in patients with type 2 diabetes.( [Balbi 2018](#29568330)) The effect of mixed tocotrienols (200 mg twice daily for 1 year) on patient-reported neuropathy Total Symptom Score (TSS) (TSS components being lancinating pain, burning pain, paresthesia, and asleep numbness) was evaluated in the Vitamin E in Neuroprotection Study (VENUS), a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with diabetes and neuropathy. After 12 months, there was no significant difference in TSS between the mixed tocotrienols and placebo groups (0.3; 95% CI, 1.16 to 0.56; P=0.49). In a post hoc subgroup analysis, patients with HbA1c greater than 8% who received mixed tocotrienols experienced a significant reduction in lancinating pain (P=0.03); further exploration is warranted in this population.( [Hor 2018](#29379943)) Similarly, in a review of clinical trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes (N=418), vitamin E supplementation did not improve glycemic control in the full set of patients. However, in subsets of patients with HbA1c of 8% or greater or with low baseline serum vitamin E levels, vitamin E was associated with improved glycemic control.

Additionally, all lipid parameters were improved with combination therapy, except for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels.( [Maktabi 2018](#30025522)) The American Diabetes Association updated guidelines on the standards of medical care in diabetes (2021) recommends individualized medical nutrition therapy programs as needed to achieve treatment goals for all people with type 1 or 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes (level A). However, they advise against routine use of dietary supplementation with antioxidants, including vitamin E, for glycemic control based on no clear evidence that it can improve outcomes as well as concern regarding long-term safety.( [ADA 2021](#33298416)) Dysmenorrhea Clinical data A 2016 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of dietary supplements for dysmenorrhea identified only low- or very-low-quality studies with very small sample sizes. Vitamin E supplementation did not demonstrate efficacy for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea compared with placebo or no treatment (2 randomized clinical trials; n=135); no difference was observed for vitamin E compared to fennel (1 randomized clinical trial; n=42), and data were unsuitable for analysis in the studies that compared vitamin E with vitamin B1 and vitamin E plus fennel with ibuprofen.( [Pattanittum 2016](#27000311)) However, in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, vitamin E (200 units/day for 8 weeks) was effective in relieving menstrual pain compared with placebo in patients between 18 and 25 years of age. The combination of vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids (ie, EPA 180 mg, DHA 120 mg) was more effective than any other treatment groups (P<0.05).( [Sadeghi 2018](#29542390)) Liver diseases The imbalance between oxidative stress and diminished antioxidant activity is purported to be a cause of liver disease. Antioxidants such as vitamin E have been evaluated in diseases of the liver. ( [Bjelakovic 2011](#21412909)) In patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), vitamin E is important for mitigating hepatocyte damage through reducing the circulation of malondialdehyde and transforming growth factor alpha-1.( [Tang 2017](#29106066)) Animal data In a study of mice undergoing partial hepatectomy, vitamin E supplementation (approximately 20 mg/day) reduced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level (a measure of oxidative stress), as well as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity scores at day 7 following hepatectomy.( [Karimian 2015](#26600128)) In rats subjected to partial hepatectomy and exposed to alcohol, which inhibits liver regeneration, a group receiving intraperitoneal doses of vitamin C 250 mg/kg/day and vitamin E 250 mg/kg/day for 5 weeks demonstrated lowered serum malondialdehyde levels and protective effects on liver function (eg, lowered ALT serum concentrations). The investigators suggested that vitamins C and E may have promoted liver regeneration.( [Okamura 2018](#30087544)) Clinical data In a Cochrane review, 15 trials of vitamin E dosed alone and in combination with other supplements (vitamin E doses ranging from 30 to 1,000 units) were reviewed. The authors found no evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin E in patients with conditions of the liver, such as alcoholic or autoimmune liver diseases, hepatitis B or C, or cirrhosis. Additionally, the data reviewed showed a nonsignificant trend towards elevated liver function tests with vitamin E (RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 0.48 to 10.67).( [Bjelakovic 2011](#21412909)) and meta-analysis of 9 randomized, placebo-controlled trials (N=889) that assessed vitamin E in NAFLD provided both a qualitative and quantitative synthesis of trial data in adult and pediatric patients with primary NAFLD. Compared to placebo, pooled data from 4 pediatric and 1 low-quality adult study showed no significant effect of vitamin E on any of the 6 parameters assessed (ALT, AST, body mass index [BMI], ballooning, fibrosis, or histology). Based on data reported in tables, qualitative improvements were reported for ALT in all trials but were only significantly better than placebo in 3 of the 5 adult trials and in none of those conducted in children. Outcome measures for AST, BMI, and steatosis scores were mixed, as were those for the other outcomes. Dosing ranged from 80 to 1,000 units once daily for adults and 222 to 888 units once daily for children.( [Amanullah 2019](#31434683)) In the Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo in the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) trial, 247 patients with NASH were randomized to receive natural vitamin E 800 units/day, pioglitazone 30 mg/day, or placebo for 96 weeks. Treatment with vitamin E was associated with a significantly higher rate of improvement in NASH compared to placebo (43% vs 19%; P=0.001). Additionally, compared with placebo, vitamin E was associated with a statistically significant improvement in liver function tests (P<0.001), reduced hepatitic steatosis (P=0.005), and reduced lobular inflammation (P=0.02). However, improvements in fibrosis scores and percentage of patients experiencing resolution of NASH were not statistically significant with vitamin E.( [Sanyal 2010](#20427778)) In the Treatment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children (TONIC) trial, 173 patients between 8 and 17 years of age with NASH were randomized to receive natural vitamin E 800 units/day, metformin 1,000 mg/day, or placebo for 96 weeks. Vitamin E was similar to placebo in reducing ALT levels. However, vitamin E was associated with significant improvements in hepatocellular ballooning scores compared with placebo. Additionally, 58% of patients receiving vitamin E (compared to 28% receiving placebo; P=0.006) experienced resolution of NASH at the completion of 96 weeks of therapy. ( [Lavine 2011](#21521847)) The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines (2018) suggest that natural vitamin E 800 units/day improves liver histology in nondiabetic patients with histologically proven NASH and may be considered useful in this population. The guidelines state that vitamin E should not be used to treat NASH in diabetic patients, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease without histological evidence cirrhosis, and cryptogenic cirrhosis.( [Chalasani 2012](#22488764)) Clinical practice guidelines published by the European Association for the Study of the Liver, European Association for the study of Diabetes, and European Association for the Study of Obesity (2016) state that vitamin E may be used in patients with NASH for short-term treatment, although firm recommendations cannot be made (level B2 evidence).
