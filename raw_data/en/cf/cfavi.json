When completed in the spring of 2005, the center will be the largest sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in the state. College of Pharmacy researchers will continue to develop and produce non-sterile pharmaceutical products such as drug tablets and capsules at the existing 5,000-square-foot facility in the UK College of Pharmacy Building. Researchers at the new Coldstream facility will develop and manufacture sterile pharmaceutical products that will be used in human clinical research studies, including vaccines, freeze-dried products, and other drugs that can be injected. Governor Fletcher described the facility as \"the cornerstone of the type of enterprises we want in Kentucky.\" Lexington Mayor Teresa Isaac also participated in the ceremonies. - UK, State Department of Corrections Launch Initiative to Improve Inmate Health UK has joined forces with the Kentucky Department of Corrections to launch the Kentucky Corrections Health Services Network, aimed at saving millions of dollars for health care while providing more effective care to the state's inmate population. The project establishes a statewide health network that delivers hospital and specialty care for approximately 16,000 state inmates. UK political science professor Phillip Roeder of the College of Arts and Sciences said the new system, which began operations in October, saved 35 percent over previous costs. Since the annual health care cost for inmates of 12 Kentucky prisons and 75 jails around the state is $15 million, officials expect a substantial savings. - Gatton College Gets $5 Million in Pledges to Support New Facilities, Research UK's Gatton College of Business and Economics received pledges totaling $5 million to support new facilities planned on Euclid Avenue, research grants, an annual speaker series, and more. BB&T Corporation and the BB&T Charitable Foundation each pledged $1.25 million for a learning laboratory on capitalism, a speaker series, an annual student paper competition, and annual fellowship and research grant awards. The funds also will assist construction of the college's new faculty and administrative building at the Gatton College's planned four-building mini-campus. UK graduate Carol Martin \"Bill\" Gatton, for whom the college is named, matched the BB&T gifts by pledging $2.5 million. Gatton is also a member of the BB&T board of directors. - Public Forums Seek Input to Review and Revise Mission of UK Appalachian Center UK conducted public forums in Hazard and Pikeville earlier this month to obtain ideas and opinions regarding the mission of the UK Appalachian Center.

A new director will be chosen based on the revised mission statement. In addition to participating in the forums, members of the public can offer input on the center's Web site at www.uky.edu/RGS/AppalCenter/. - UK Online Employment System Celebrates First Anniversary UK's Online Employment System (OES) celebrated its first anniversary in November and scores high on customer satisfaction surveys. None of the responses dropped below 4.0 on the rating scale in which 5.0 was the top rating. Human Resources officials report a much faster process of screening and evaluating job applicants, as well as substantial savings created by reduced need for position advertisements. In its first year, 2,440 positions were posted on the OES, with 1,650 being filled, 328 being canceled, and 462 in process. The system referred 34,438 candidates to hiring officials. More than 18,000 regular employment applications were created by people interested in jobs at the university. - UK Department Offers Holiday Cheer to Soldiers in Iraq The staff of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in Kentucky Clinic provided a brighter holiday for more than 30 soldiers in the U.S. Army's 16 Signal Battalion. The members of Charley Company received 15 boxes filled with items not necessarily issued by the military, such as baby wipes; small personal care items; flea powder and collars; condiment packets of salt, pepper, ketchup and mustard; beef jerky; and reading materials and small crafts to help pass the time. Office staff raised funds by donating $5 a month to wear blue jeans on Fridays. Physicians matched the staff's donations, raising $325 to purchase the gift items and pay for shipping. - Kentucky Geological Survey Studies Ways to Mitigate Climate Change Geologists at the Kentucky Geological Survey (KGS) are studying how greenhouse gases from burning coal and other fossil fuels can be captured and stored in reservoirs beneath the earth's surface as a strategy to mitigate climate change. KGS is a partner in the Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership, which has won a $2.4 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, Ohio Coal Development Office, and other participants for the two-year project. The project will focus on \"carbon sequestration,\" a process that would capture emissions from coal-burning power plants and large industrial facilities and store them in reservoirs beneath the earth's surface, rather than releasing the emissions into the atmosphere. - College of Social Work to Help Incarcerated Fathers Bond With Their Children A three-year, $600,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will support the UK College of Social Work's participation in a program to help incarcerated fathers bond with their children. The Fathers and Children Together Program aims at reducing the potential of child abuse and neglect by promoting fathers' involvement in their children's lives. It attempts to create positive father/child experiences and opportunities for learning inside prison. The program is jointly sponsored by Prevent Child Abuse Kentucky and Blackburn Correctional Complex, located near Lexington.

In November, Todd visited residents of Hazard, London and Benham in southeastern Kentucky to encourage greater private financial support for the Robinson Scholars Program. - Former Congressman Ronald Dellums Speaks at Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration Ronald V. Dellums, who served nearly three decades in the U.S. House of Representatives, was the featured speaker at the 2004 Martin Luther King Jr. Day program in downtown Lexington.

Since retiring from Congress, he has focused on health issues such as AIDS and is president of the international health care consulting firm Dellums, Bauer and Halterman. The King Day celebration, which marks the birthday of the famed civil rights leader, is co-sponsored by UK and the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government. - UK Officials Join Governor Fletcher's Team in Frankfort James W.

Chemistry professor David Atwood became interested in the project after a student, Jerrod Dempsey, reported an excessively high morbidity rate for retired firefighters from heart and respiratory diseases.
