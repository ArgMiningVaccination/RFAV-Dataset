These three bio-energies are called Vatha, Pitta, and Kapha and they govern the function of our bodies on a physical and emotional level and determine the body-mind constitution. We all have one predominant dosha, yet everyone has a little of the other two. When the doshas are in balance, you experience good health whereas an imbalance leads to disease. Variations from the diet and lifestyle according to your body type can lead to imbalances easily. Knowing your predominant body type helps you design a healthy lifestyle and live a happy and balanced life. This quiz will give you an idea about your Dosha type. When answering the questions, think about your whole life, not just your most recent condition. Consider at least the last 12 months or more. You might not always have every condition listed within an answer choice, just choose the one that is the best fit for you. "}
