Forecasters are calling for rapid intensification as the storm passes to the west of Lee County, and even after the storm passes, conditions will demand that residents use common sense and caution. There is also a lot of storm activity on the south side of this hurricane. That will continue into the evening and overnight. Be vigilant and smart. Don't go the beach to watch waves or recreate. Don't let children play in the rain and standing water. Stay indoors during the height of the wind. Don't drive through flooded water. Stay indoors this evening and overnight. Avoid unnecessary trips. The Lee County Emergency Operations Center continues to operate at a Level 1 activation and is holding regularly scheduled briefings with partners such as the Florida Division of Emergency Management, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, as well as local EOC partners. City of Bonita Springs staff are active, have been completing storm prep, checking neighborhoods, and providing residents with information about the Safe Haven locations and the Lee Tran schedule. City staff is also stationed at the Lee County Emergency Operations Center. UPDATE ON SAFE HAVENS: The county reminds residents that there are no evacuation orders in place and none are anticipated. To help residents from coastal areas who may be in housing still recovering from Hurricane Ian damage, the county opened two Safe Havens Monday night. Locations are: North Fort Myers Recreation Center, 2000 N. Recreation Park Way, North Fort Myers Estero Recreation Center, 9200 Corkscrew Palms Blvd., Estero The Safe Havens remain open today. Pets are welcome; Lee County Domestic Animal Services staff members are on site. LeeTran's free shuttles to both Safe Havens will continue this morning. Last pickup on places such as Pine Island is at 12:30 p.m. today. Find details at www.leegov.com/storm. Residents who want to take advantage of a Safe Haven are asked to arrive by lunchtime in advance of the anticipated deteriorating weather conditions. REMINDERS: Lee County Government is closed today and tomorrow. City of Bonita Springs Government is closed today August 29, 2023 and tomorrow August 30, 2023. Regular curbside trash collection is continuing. Trucks deployed today as early as possible and Solid Waste reports no problems. WHAT'S NEXT: Lee County EOC will continue to monitor throughout the day, especially the squall lines. EOC is staffed with county employees and local partners who are well positioned to implement any response activities needed throughout the duration of the storm. BRIDGES: The Florida Department of Transportation projects on the Sanibel Causeway and the Matlacha area are secured. Contractors are mobilized and will be monitoring the sites and will immediately inspect the sites after the storm passes. Lee County does not literally \"close\" bridges during tropical storms or hurricanes with barricades, cones, gates or signs because they can easily blow away, becoming ineffective and hazardous. Lee DOT strongly advises motorists to stay off bridges - and the roads leading to them\u2014 when sustained winds reach 40 mph (tropical storm force). At those speeds, wind gusts can already be much higher. Winds also become stronger at higher elevations, so dangers increase on higher bridges and elevated roadways. Motorists may encounter law enforcement officers during weather events around and near bridges. Follow the directions given. STATE OF LOCAL EMERGENCY Lee County is included in the Governor's Executive Order, and the county is under a State of Local Emergency. The City of Bonita Springs also declared a State of Local Emergency. This SOLE is a necessary step to ensure the city and county can recover any costs, should damage occur. Each storm needs its own SOLE for this purpose.
