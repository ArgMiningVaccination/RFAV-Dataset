Naturally! Natural Allergy Solutions Since this is the time of year that many of you begin to suffer with Air-borne allergies, I wanted to offer you the natural solutions for all your allergy needs. But before we get into that, it is always important to understand the mechanism of a problem, so you can address the real cause, and then prevent the problem once and for all. And this is the real purpose for this newsletter. Why Do I Get Allergies? This is one of the most common questions I hear in my office. And it has been for the past 18 years. This is why I went to learn two different allergy techniques to help address them. The first is called Nambudripad Allergy Elimination Technique, (NAET) and the second is called Total Body Modification (TBM). NAET was the first technique I learned and was very effective, but involved a person staying away from their specific allergen for a period of 24 hours. Many times this was too inconvenient, so I continued to research for a better solution and was introduced to TBM. This method is quite effective and when the person's been properly prepared, I can use this technique to eliminate an allergen within about 30 seconds. And the person can then go right back to their life-style without any avoidance period. This has made treatment much more user-friendly for the practice member. To understand why you get allergies, one must first understand the mechanism for them. Allergies result from incomplete breakdown of whole proteins, followed by the absorption of those whole proteins into the blood stream. Under normal digestion, these whole proteins should be broken down into their basic building blocks known as amino acids, before being absorbed into the blood stream. The amino acids are then delivered to the Liver for the assignment of repairing and rebuilding within the body. So what would cause a person to begin having allergies? There exists a common condition among allergy sufferers were there is an imbalance within the digestive system as a result of, among other things, [antibiotic therapy](http://content.spineboy.com/view.php?p=%20I%20thought%20antibiotics%20were%20safe.%20If%20so,%20what%20is%20the%20harm%20in%20prescribing%20them?%20%28antibiotic%20therapy,antibiotic%20treatment%29&n=15127). I mention this specifically because it is so common in this country, and it is something everyone must understand, especially if you have progressed to the point of having allergies. What occurs within the body as a result of antibiotic therapy is a loss of healthy digestive bacteria, and the basis for an overgrowth of digestive Yeast and Candidia, two normal fungi that also assist in the digestive process. How does one know if they suffer from this imbalance? One may notice an increase craving for sugar, along with the symptoms of intestinal gas and bloating. This is an indication that the overgrowth of Yeast and Candidia has taken place. As a consequence, complete digestion can not take place, and it results in incomplete protein breakdown. When the proteins fail to fully break down, they will then cross the digestive system wall and enter into the bloodstream. This should never take place. The Immune System, which is designed to attack foreign invaders that enter the blood stream, including whole proteins, will now attack these undigested proteins. The Immune response then generates the release of histamine from the cells, which most have come to know as the Allergy Reaction. Once a person has this imbalance, and the Immune System continues to attack these undigested proteins, the Immune System will begin to have trouble rebuilding its immune cells. This is because the cells are formed from the amino acid building blocks that the digestive system is not delivering due to the incomplete protein digestion. As a consequence, the Immune System begins to fail, and the person finds themselves getting sick all the time. Another component to this complex imbalance within the body results from the ingestion of dairy and cheese. By eating these foods in conjunction to having the overgrowth of yeast and candidia will result in the body producing excess amounts of mucus. If this mucus develops in the intestinal system, stagnant digestion known as constipation results. If it effects the respiratory system, asthma, airborne allergies and sinus congestion results. If the mucus then traps infection, it can lead to sinus infections or lung infections. And the treatment for this would be the antibiotic therapy. Unfortunately, if you have understood what you have read here, you will realize that the antibiotic therapy created much of this imbalance to begin with. As a result, by continuing to repeat the process, without restoring normal balance, you will never get out of the cycle. What Can I Do For My Allergies? The most important thing you can do is work to improve the functioning of your digestive system. Until this returns to normal, your Immune System will continue to attack the undigested proteins from your diet, and you will continue to have allergies. While this process of improving your digestion is occurring, it would benefit you not to have certain foods within your diet. These include, milk, cheese, vinegar, alcohol, sugar, breads, pastas and cereals. The reason for these limits is because each of them goes to feeding the problem. And until the elimination occurs, you will continue to have allergies. In the mean time, there are several natural remedies designed to help assist in eliminating the symptoms of allergies. The first of these is the TBM technique I mentioned at the beginning of this newsletter. All you need to do is come into the office and allow me to evaluate you for some basic sensitivities/allergies, and then we can go after whatever your body is sensitive to. To assist in the process, we have a few natural supplements and homeopathic remedies as well. The main nutritional assistants products of Standard Process are Antronex, which is a natural antihistamine to be taken regularly during the allergy season, and Allerplex, designed to combat the effects of the allergic response as well as asthma. We would also want to consider Cal-Amo, as most people who suffer with allergies are too alkaline. Herbal remedies for allergies from Mediherb include Albezia Complex, or Euphrasia Complex and potentially Livco. Each are designed to support the natural response to the allergic reaction within the body. Last, but not least, we have two very helpful homeopathic remedies, one called Allergy Remedy, designed specifically for allergies, and the other would be ER 911, which assists the body by quieting the alarm response within the nervous system.
