Rogue Expeditions What: It's a roving retreat for runners of all levels, with trips in places like Patagonia, Oregon, and British Columbia. Typical Day: In Oregon, you'll run six to 12 miles over single-track trails through Douglas-fir forests and past waterfalls. Tip: Focus on efforts, not paces, says cofounder and elite runner Allison Macsas. \"Navigating roots, rocks, and steep climbs takes practice. Ignore the numbers on your watch and concentrate on each step. Stay relaxed for the first half so you can finish strong.\" Fuel: Frittata brunches overlooking thousand-foot cliffs, picnics alongside pristine rivers, and dinners cooked over campfires. Recover: Relax by floating down lazy rivers. Cost: About $2,600 for five nights; [roguexpeditions.com ](https://www.roguexpeditions.com/) by Mantas Zvinas, this pop-up retreat celebrates his passions\u2014surfing, yoga, and, yup, beer\u2014in hidden spots in Nicaragua, Morocco, and Mexico. Typical Day: At Playa Maderas in Nicaragua, schedules are based on the waves but usually feature surf lessons, fitness classes, yoga, and snorkeling. Tip: Single-leg yoga poses can fine-tune your balance, says Zvinas. \"Try the Superman pose to strengthen your core and lower back muscles,\" he adds. It mimics many movements in the water: Drop down onto your stomach, lift both legs and arms to assume a flying position, then move one arm at a time as though you're paddling on a board. Continue for 20 seconds for each set. Fuel: Local and fresh fish tacos washed down with fruit smoothies. Recover: Dance on the beach and drink eight-person, men-only fitness camps take place in wilderness locations, where you learn to lift explosively, move with greater agility, and sleep outdoors. (Bring a blanket or a sleeping bag.) Typical Day: In Embudo, New Mexico, at MovNat Crucible, led by Vic Verdier, C.S.C.S., a former French naval officer and wilderness EMT, you'll lift logs, climb trees, carry rocks, and take on other challenges that push you out of your comfort zone. Tip: \"Sprinting is a great way to build explosiveness and mobility,\" says Verdier. \"A safe way to begin is to sprint uphill. It will self-limit your sprint in order to avoid any injury.\" Sprint for 10 to 20 yards and take as long as you want to recover. Do 10 reps. Fuel: Very little water and almost no food. Recover: You'll be fried. Sleep, sleep, sleep. Cost: $800 for three nights; [movnat.com ](https://www.movnat.com/) Cal-a-Vie Golf Spa What: Just less than an hour north of San Diego, this luxury retreat looks like it belongs in the French countryside, with fields of lavender and hills lined with grapevines, plus a links-style golf course. Typical Day: Play the par 72 course, then kick back at the pool or hike the trails and explore the on-site labyrinth. Tip: Constant awareness of the undulating terrain is critical to scoring low, says Head Club Pro, Ryan Dohrmann. On a sidehill lie, when the golf ball is above your feet (assuming right-handed golfer): grip down on the golf club and aim further to the right, as the ball will typically fly to the left. On a sidehill lie, when the golf ball is below your feet (assuming right-handed golfer): setup with knees flexed more then normal and aim further left as the ball flight will typically fly to the right. Fuel: Elevated spa food from the retreat's popular cookbook, like duck breast with spaghetti squash, olive-golden-raisin relish, and spiced yogurt. Recover: If you're not used to playing back-to-back days, gently soothe tired muscles with an aquatic massage or pamper tired feet with a reflexology session. Cost: $5,500 for Cycling Club Summits What: Three-day biking trips take you to epic cycling locations, including Bentonville, Arkansas; Los Angeles; and Mallorca in Spain. Typical Day: Bentonville: Choose from three to five rides of varying lengths\u201430 to 75 miles\u2014over gravel and paved roads through the dense forests and rolling hills of the Ozarks. Tip: For gearing on gravel, opt for easier rather than harder gears to give you greater endurance, says Sarah Sturm, a cyclo-cross national champion. \"Stay in your comfort zone descending and cornering on gravel\u2014slip 'n' slides are for your backyard, not your ride.\" Fuel: Berkshire Hog Chop and creamed leeks with a side of grits at the Hive, a Bentonville favorite for the best local food and produce. Recover: Pack a foam roller to squeeze out all that lactic acid from your aching quads and calves.

It's just hours into my first day at Sensei, and I'm already working out. Well, sort of. I'm jumping straight up as trainer Kyle Silvey, C.S.C.S., studies my vertical. Silvey is my guide on this trip to Sensei, a new wellness resort created by Oracle founder Larry Ellison and David Agus, M.D., founding director of USC's Institute for Transformative Medicine. Together, they built a 24-acre compound on a small island in Hawaii. The tranquil, no-kids-under-16 resort has trails through a forest of Cook pines, private spa areas, open spaces for horseback riding and archery, and an adventure course where you can zip-line through the jungle. It's also home to Sensei's Optimal Wellbeing Program, which aims to deliver personalized insights to me in four key areas: fitness, nutrition, mental health, and breathing. I'm here for a five-day mind-body reset. The go-go stress of New York City has me frazzled, and I want better tools to manage that. As my tiny vertical leap attests, my workouts need an infusion of athletic moves. Fourteen days before my flight, I'd completed a questionnaire about long-term wellness goals and linked my Whoop 4.0 fitness tracker to Sensei's portal so that Silvey could scrutinize my metrics. Sensei built my itinerary using that information and set out to guide me to wellness gains. I was skeptical, but my Whoop data revealed that I was overtraining, and the blue sky\u2014and ocean\u2014provided an inspiring backdrop for new thinking. Breathing: Keep It Simple When I meet with mindset guide Marcus Washington, the last thing I want is another complicated breathing technique. Washington sticks to the basics. He has me choose either four-second inhales and exhales or six-second inhales and exhales. All I have to do is maintain one technique for two minutes. I appreciate the simplicity of deep breathing, especially when Washington shows me how it affects my heart-rate variability. A high HRV signals that your body is ready for action. Washington connects me to a real-time HRV tracker, and I watch as it rises during this drill. I now breathe like this for two minutes pre-workout. Nutrition: Oatmeal Up On my second day, I sit down with registered dietitian Marlee Finkelstein, who walks me through the results of a blood-panel test and analyzes my diet. I mention to her that my muscles haven't looked as full in recent months, and she pinpoints the problem: My high-protein diet lacks carbs. The fix: a cup of oatmeal with brown sugar every morning, a snack that I add to my rotation. Meditation: Enjoy The Noise New York City leaves little room to contemplate silence, so meditation expert Nico Akiba proposes I try listening intently to any and all sounds around me for 90 seconds. Instead of cutting myself off from the world, I'm learning to focus and choose what I hear. Months later, I do this often, whenever I need to collect myself. Fitness: Contrast It On the last day of my trip, Silvey suggests a solution to my lack of explosiveness\u2014contrast training. We do four reps of heavy Romanian deadlifts, then immediately do four vertical jumps. The heavy move recruits an abundance of muscle fibers, he says, prepping my body to jump higher. We do five sets, resting two minutes between them. Five weeks later, when Silvey checks in with me (your guide stays in contact with you for several months), I tell him I feel more explosive, thanks to twice-a-week contrast sessions. With the help of breathing drills to control my HRV, I'm finally logging high Whoop recovery scores again. Sensei's guides gave me the lessons I needed\u2014and listening to the rhythmic sound of crashing waves didn't hurt, either.

I'm making my best cowboy clicking sounds and staring at Maple, urging the 800-plus-pound, 15-year-old chestnut Missouri Fox Trotter to walk toward me. Maple is my equine partner in this nonverbal-communication exercise. The goal is for me to lead her, showing her where to move in a collaborative dance of space. She is not budging. Horses don't respond to auditory cues or eye contact, says animal-connections specialist Jen Leahey, call sign nature. (All instructors here wear a name tag with a word that characterizes their true essence.) Horses communicate using energy and touch and are all about being emotionally present. They also see the world in the soft gaze, favored by expert meditators. First, I need to connect with Maple by petting her with long, firm strokes, \"like a mare licking a foal.\" Then I need to project where I want her to move and trust she will go there. Our dance is more of a shuffle\u2014I walk to where I want Maple to go, and she follows, sometimes quickly and other times slowly\u2014but soon we're grooving. By connecting with Maple, I'm also connecting with myself. Before arriving at Miraval Berkshires in western Massachusetts, I had a consultation about \"the intention for my journey\" and identified a word to guide me. Mine is connect, with my partner as well as myself. We're working parents, with a two-year-old and a tween, and after two years of cooped-up pandemic living, we wanted\u2014okay, needed\u2014some intense self-care and uninterrupted together time. Miraval is seeing more people like me, says Simon Marxer, associate vice president of spa and well-being, \"guys who are seeking a personal experience, some dimension of transformation, and a sense of inspiration, versus simply seeking relaxation.\" The experiences menu glows with wellness options, everything from paddleboard yoga and adventure-course exercises to forest bathing and aura imaging. Along with dancing with Maple, three other experiences stood out. Use Exercise to Exorcise Stress In the 80-minute session called Tension Release Exercises, spiritual coach Mark Gerow, call sign resilience, explores how your muscles can store trauma and stress and guides you to release both. We target the psoas, the girdle of muscle that runs from your lumbar spine to your hips, by doing a series of exercises that fatigue the muscles around it. Then I lie down with my knees apart but the soles of my feet together, inhale and exhale deeply, bring my knees closer together, and . . . wait. I didn't expect anything to happen, but after several minutes, my hips start to quiver. resilience explains that this is normal and that my body is releasing stress. It's deeply unnerving as the shaking and fluttering come in unpredictable waves. I imagine traumatic memories leaving my body like Slimer & Co. being zapped in Ghostbusters. It's that weird and goes on for about 30 minutes. Afterward, I feel profoundly relaxed. resilience says it's a therapy that can be used to treat back pain, anxiety, and even migraines. Seed a Better Smoothie Miraval Berkshires offers culinary and nutrition classes on everything from knife skills to kombucha brewing. In Blend 'N' Balance Smoothies, a 45-minute workshop led by program chef Beatrice Blais, aka joyful, I learn to make three classic smoothies\u2014chocolate/peanut butter/banana protein, berry antioxidant, and power greens\u2014even more nutritious and tasty. My favorite is the berry smoothie that joyful says doubles as a hangover cure and digestion aid\u2014the chia seeds help scrub gunk from your gut. Berry antioxidant In a blender, mix 2 cups mixed berries, \u00bc cup chia seeds, \u00bc cup rolled oats, 1 apple, juice from \u00bd lemon, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 16 oz coconut water, and some ice. Serves 2 Stretch a Smile Upon Your Face \"Be kind; be compassionate to your body,\" says fitness specialist Tariq Pinkston, aka empathy. In his Happy Hips class, we're spending 45 minutes doing gentle yoga--inspired moves to open up the hips and improve mobility. I now do three of them once a week as a hips circuit: - Foam-roll: Quads\u2014front and back\u2014and glutes. - Raises: Lying on your side, raise your top leg for 5 reps, circle it for 5 reps, and pulse for 5 reps. Switch sides and repeat. Do 3 rounds per side. - Openers: Lying on your back with your legs straight, take your right foot and draw a semicircle toward your butt. Repeat 5 times, then circle the other way. Switch sides and repeat. Do 3 rounds per side. Breathe Yourself To Sleep In Meditation for Superior Sleep, also taught by RESILIENCE, you learn to scan your body mindfully to help you fall asleep. Start lying your back with hand on your belly and breathe deeply in and out; inhaling and exhaling out of your nose. RESILIENCE says gradually slow your breathing by exhaling for longer than you inhale. Then breathe in calmly and think about a tense area of your body, for example between your eyes, and then exhale and relax that area. Repeat that sequence for 10 to 15 other body parts, and repeat the whole cycle until you fall asleep! Another sleep tip RESILIENCE shares: Put a red night-light in bathroom because it will reduce light stimulation if natural calls. The totality of those experiences, plus the mindful vibe of the resort\u2014with downtime by the pool, hikes in the forest, tasty local food (think grass-fed filet, broccolini, aubergine puree, pomegranate liqueur, ancho-chile liqueur, and lime juice)\u2014helped shift our world into a softer, kinder focus. Maple would approve.

Evryman's retreat helps men connect with themselves\u2014and others. In nature-based locations like the Berkshires and Joshua Tree, therapists and life coaches facilitate group conversations to ask deeper questions, all in the presence of other men asking similar questions. \"It creates a real opening for guys to put aside all of the sarcasm, performance, and bullshit so that we can really look at ourselves and ask, 'who am I and who do I want to be?'\" explains EVRYMAN cofounder Lucas Krump.
