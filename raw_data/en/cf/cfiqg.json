It also uses up the Earth's resources and pollutes her ecosystems. This volume describes different kinds of energy machines which depend on the principle of implosion: - a spring water-producing machine - a tornado home energy generator - a Klimator which produces mountain-quality air - the biotechnical submarine - a technique for producing power from ocean deeps About the Author Viktor Schauberger (1885-1958) came from a long line of forest custodians. An Austrian naturalist, philosopher and inventor, his extraordinary understanding of the workings of nature derived from his keen powers of observation in the forest where he worked. Callum Coats is the author of Living Energies, the standard work of reference on Viktor Schauberger's ideas and studied with Schauberger's son, Walter, in Austria. "}
