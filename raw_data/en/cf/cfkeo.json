Stalbaum ACL Grants Management Specialist: Jan -Sheri Morris Page | 4 Introduction Arkansas \"Take the Time\" Lifespan Respite The Arkansas Department of Human Services - Division of Provider Services and Quality Assurance submitted a grant proposal application on May 21, 2021, for the Lifespan Respite Care Program: State Program Enhancement Grants (Funding Opportunity Number: HHS -2021- ACL-AOA -LRLI-0045) by the Administration for Community Living. On July 8, 2022 , Arkansas received the Notice of Award (Number: 90LRLI0045- 02-00) in the total budget period amount of $ 369,924.00. The breakdown of this project period funding (July 01, 202 2, through June 30, 202 3) is: Federal Share totaling $274, 985.00 State General Revenue/Non -Federal Share totaling $ 94,939.00 This report is the first report submitted within the award term, and includes activities and challenges experienced during t he first six months of the project period: July 1, 2022 , through December 31 , 2022 . Overall Goal and Objectives The overall project goal is to continue improving overall quality of life for Arkansas caregivers, inclusive of all groups and communities, but with a cognitive effort to reach underserved populations through education, increased awareness and resource allocation, and technological advances in a user- friendly environment to consolidate the statewide respite system. Objectives include: 1) implemen ting a robust centralized Arkansas Lifespan Respite Search/Locator ; 2) drafting and implementing by -laws for the ALRC ; 3) updating statewide caregiving data at the beginning and end of the grant project term in order to assess effectiveness; 4) identifying underserved populations; 5) increasing opportunity for caregiver input and feedback; 6) launching a large -scale informational and educational outreach, particularly to the underserved; and 7) direct service opportunities and training events. Project P artn ers The A rkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition (A LRC) membership is representative of professionals and other respite organizations and advocacy groups, as well as family caregivers themselves. A list of all current coalition members can be found in Appendix I. During the reporting period, coalition meetings were held August 10, 2022, September 28, 2022, and a special coalition meeting held on October 26, 2022 . The Arkansas D epartment of Human Services partners with the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences - Schmieding Caregiver Training Center to provide volunteer respite training per the grant objectives. This partnership has been in existence for the past four years and continues currently . Currently, Arkansas DHS and the ALRC are also partnering with ARCH National Respite Network and Resource Center, National Academy for State Health Policy, and the Respite Care Association of Wisconsin (RCAW) to develop and implement a Respite Provider Recruitment, Training and Retention Page | 5 Project. This pilot project is funded through RCAW's national application for a Lifespan Respite Care Program Grant: Special Projects to Strengthen Program Development, Implementation and Sustainability (#HHS -2020- ACL-AOA -LRSP -0432). Arkansas is using this pilot p roject in conjunction with objectives listed in our Lifespan Respite grant, to maximize outcomes and build on our respite training goals . The Arkansas Department of Human Services is also partnering with the Alzheimer's Association - Arkansas Chapter and Alzheimer's Arkansas to pilot an Alzheimer's and Dementia Respite Voucher Program. This pilot project, while not using funding from this grant, is using funding from Arkansas' Social Services Block Grant awarded to DHS. Activities and Accomplishments What d id you accomplish during this reporting period and how did these accomplishments help you reach your stated project goal(s) and objectives(s)? Please note any significant project partners and their role in project activities. The following list are accomp lishments during the reporting period. [Note: all project partners are listed in above section]: Continued to maintain the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Locator to the public with enhancement designs Continued to maintain the in-house Lifespan Respite Voucher Program, forms, and funding process Released to the public a copy of the survey feedback report titled \"2022 Arkansas Caregiver Feedback: Preliminary Data Report\" 2022 Arkansas Caregiver and Respite Conference Release of the first Arkansas Lifespan Respite Caregiver Video Launched a statewide multi -media educational and awareness campaign Launched an education and awareness campaign by mailout to Arkansas public and charter schools Participated in outreach events Drafted legislative language to incorporate Lifespan Respite into Arkansas state law What, if any, challenges did you face during this reporting period and what actions did you take to address these challenges? Please note in your response changes, if any, to your project goal(s), objective( s), or activities that were made as a result of challenges faced. COVID -19 limitations continue to hinder in -person gatherings and awareness events anticipated for the reporting period. All coalition meetings and additional Lifespan Respite workgroup event s have been held via Zoom. This form of virtual meeting can limit the interaction that some participants may be able Page | 6 to have and can also risk multi- tasking by participants who are not fully engaged in the meeting or discussions. Coalition member engageme nt also continues to limit activities. There are a handful of members who are actively engaged and participate on multiple levels; however, many members may log in for the coalition meeting but choose not to participate outside of the bi -monthly meeting. Changes have been made to the coalition membership form including information on how much time per month the prospective member can dedicate to coalition work as well as what they are looking to gain from that participation. How have the activities conducted during this project period helped you to achieve the measurable outcomes identified in your project proposal? The following measurable outcome activities are divided below by project proposal objective: Implement a Robust Centralized Arkansas Lifespan R espite Locator In the first reporting period, Arkansas DHS worked with its vendor, Deloitte, to develop a respite locator search engine, via PowerBI . Prior to the search engine, a list of known respite providers was manually kept on an excel spreadsheet within DPSQA and offered to any caregiver who inquired. During th is reporting period, the search engine has continued to function as appropriate, and no issues have been detected. The first independent respite worker was added to the respite locator on February 9, 2022. A total of six (6) independent respite workers (covering 15 counties across the state) were added to the respite locator during the reporting period. Discussions also began internally with other DHS divisions and externally with the Arkansas State Police on how to begin completing background checks on those independent respite workers that are adding to the search engine. There is currently state statute in place for any licensed organization providing respite to complete background checks, including searc hes within the Arkansas Adult and Child Maltreatment Registries; however, there is no current statute in place for independent respite workers as would pertain to this scenario. Since both maltreatment registries are maintained by divisions within DHS, int ernal processes were developed for these registry inquiries to be ran at no cost. The program then began developing a draft legislative bill that would incorporate a background check requirement for a newly identified state program entitled the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Program. This draft legislation is currently being reviewed by DHS's legal department and must receive both DHS Secretary and Arkansas Governor approval to proceed to filing when the Arkansas 94 th General Assembly is called into order in Jan uary 2023. Updating Statewide Caregiving Data and Identifying Underserved Populations During the first reporting period, Arkansas DHS , along with the ALRC members, have developed caregiver data points and requirements it would like to have surveyed and co llected during the caregiver data collection activities. Initial data collection activities were expected to be completed through a procured vendor; however, no vendor could be procured. To continue this activity, DHS along with the ALRC members agreed to conduct the data collection through an online survey tool, SurveyMonkey. Page | 7 The survey pool was selected from recipients with open cases in 21 Medicaid categories administered by the Arkansas Department of Human Services. An initial report of 300,251 individuals were then sorted for duplications and email availability: leaving 64,943 potential respondents. The online survey was then opened to the targeted population on February 24, 2022 and closed on March 11, 2022; a period of 16 days. The targeted populati on was notified of the online survey via email notification sent from DHS's mass notification system known as Salesforce. The email was successfully delivered to 61,070 of available email addresses: a delivery rate of 94%. Upon closure of the targeted surv ey on March 11, 2022, the email had been opened by 23,463 individuals. The qualify for the survey, respondents had to self- identify as someone who had provided unpaid care to a relative or friend 18 years of age or older. This unpaid care must involve help ing the individual care for themselves, or caring for a child (minor, less than 18 years of age) due to a medical, behavioral, or other condition or disability (beyond required normal care). In total, there were 553 individuals who accessed the survey and 428 self -identified caregivers who completed it. The reading and analysis of the data began in April 2022 . While the expectation was for the data report to be released prior to the end of this reporting period, the report deadline has now been extended. An anticipated release of the data report is set to occur prior to the end of the first semi- annual report within Year 2's grant year. Increase Opportunity for Caregiver Input and Feedback Caregiver input and feedback has been limited to the open invitation to attend Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition meetings at this time. With the development of several other projects (such as the search locator, respite voucher program, etc.) ending, efforts will now be turned toward this objective as outreach and evalua tion of these activities begin. Direct Service Opportunities Through our project proposal, direct service opportunities were broken into two categories: respite vouchers and services and training opportunities. During the first grant year, Arkansas DHS w orked to develop an in -house voucher program to be processed through the Choices in Living Resource Center (also known a s the Aging and Disability Resource Center - ADRC - for the state of Arkansas). During this reporting period, 134 respite vouchers applications were received and 101 were awarded . 23 of Arkansas' 75 counties were represented in the voucher awards. 13 of the 2 3 counties have been identified as rural regions with an average of 28% of the voucher awards and funding being provided to rural regio ns. Ashley - 2** Baxter - 2 ** Benton - 22 Boone - 3 ** Cleburne - 2 ** Craighead - 3 Crawford - 2 Crittenden - 2 Faulkner - 10 Greene - 3 ** Hot Spring - 1 ** Independence -3** Jackson - 1 ** Jefferson - 4 ** Johnson - 1 ** Perry - 2 ** Pope - 2 ** Pulaski - 17 * Saline - 3 Sebastian - 2 St Francis - 2 ** Washington - 10 White - 2 ** Page | 8 *Indicates county locating State Capital; **Indicates rural defined counties per a 2013 University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture report1 12 diagnoses categories were developed fo r the voucher awards. The most prevalent diagnoses category was for Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities. Alzheimer's/Dementia - 4 Heart Defect/Issues - 1 Lung Defect/Issues - 4 Stroke - 1 Cancer - 0 Vision Impairment/Blind - 1 Depression/Mood Disorder - 2 I/DD - 77 ** Behavior Disorder - 0 Epilepsy/Seizures - 4 Skeletal Disorders - 1 Other - 3 * *Includes CVA with left hemiparesis, Fibromyalgia and Morbid Obesity; * * Includes diagnoses of Angelman's Syndrome, Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Spina Bifida, Down Syndrome Based on service delivery reports that were required to be submitted upon the use of the voucher, we were able to pull information regarding how the vouchers are being used. For example, based on the service delivery reports, the average hourly pay paid out through the voucher awards was $16.10, an approximate $2 increase from the previous grant year's average of $14.09. The lowest hourly pay reported during the reporting period was $ 6.25/hr (for a full weekend/overnight respite event) while the highest pay appeared to be $ 55.00/hr. Service delivery reports indicated a total of 866 hours of respite were received, approximately 36 days during the reporting period. The overall service hours are down from the previous grant year due to the fact that we did not receive as many of the voucher reports and satisfaction surveys back from caregivers who received funding. Caregivers receiving respite vouchers were also asked to complete a satisfaction feedback survey upon the use of their voucher. Of the satisfaction surveys returned, 9 7% of caregivers indicated that they found the voucher program \"very useful.\" 66% of care givers found the voucher application process to be \"very easy\", a growth from the previous grant year's feedback where only 58% of caregivers found the voucher application process to be \"very easy .\" 33% found it to be \"somewhat easy\" while 3% found it \"di fficult.\" Concerns identified indicate that the voucher program and its application was hard for caregivers to find, as well as wishing they could apply for more than three ( 3) months of funding at one time. Several caregivers did apply within multiple qu arters and indicated on their satisfaction surveys that after the initial application, the process was much quicker and easier to complete. Much of this is due to the fact that the state of Arkansas has to set the caregiver up as a vendor in order to proce ss the check, which is done during the first application process. Once a caregiver has a vendor number valid in the system and reapplies, checks can be issued within a couple days as opposed to weeks. In addition to our grant voucher activities, Arkansas l egislators in early 2022 authorized the Arkansas Department of Human Services to allocate funding for a new respite voucher pilot program geared 1 University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture.

Arkansas: 2013. https://www.uaex.uada.edu/business -communiti es/economic - development/Rural%20Profile%20of%20Arkansas%202013%20Pub.pdf Page | 9 towards caregivers caring for Alzheimer's or other dementia related needs. While this funding was not taken fro m the federal Lifespan respite grant, the pilot program received $200,000 beginning June 2022. This pilot program will run through June 2023; respite inquiries made to the Lifespan Respite Voucher Program for dementia related diagnoses will be turned over to the pilot program's voucher system for processing. This allows for the pilot program to collect as much data and information on dementia caregivers in the state while freeing the Lifespan respite voucher funding to be awarded to other diagnoses categories. If at any time the pilot program exhausts all of their funding, the Lifespan Respite Voucher Program will begin processing voucher applications for those diagnoses so that there is no gap in coverage. As of the end of this reporting period, the Dementia pilot project had issued a total of 278 voucher awards to caregivers caring for someone with dementia or a dementia- related illness. Our project proposal included direct support opportunities through volunteer training events facilitated by the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences - Schmieding Caregiver Training Program. Arkansas DHS has partnered with The Schmieding Caregiver Training Program f or these training events in previous ly awarded respite grants. During the reporting period, Arkansas DHS and UAMS were contracted for REST services effective July 1, 2022 , through June 30, 2023 ; UAMS began offering classes in September 2022 across the stat e. Recent years have seen challenges in coordinating the contract's purchase orders from DHS to UAMS timely. The training dates and locations for the reporting period include: Date Location (City) Number of Attendees 9/29/2022 El 10/6/22 Texark ana Texarkana 1 (Train the Trainer) 12/7/22 Jonesboro 6 Additional to the project activities set forth in the grant proposal, Arkansas DHS, along with members of the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition, continue to work with the nati onal respite resource program, ARCH, and the Respite Care Association of Wisconsin (RCAW) on a multi -state pilot project designing and implementing an online, self- paced certification course providing minimum skills and knowledge for respite care workers. The online training/certification modules went live on January 1, 2022. During the reporting period, 10 individuals have successfully completed the online training (26 total since go -live) . This online module certification also allow s those who complete the course successfully to display their respite services on the Arkansas Lifespan Res pite Search Locator. During the reporting period, 2 of the 10 (20%) certification holders have requested to be added to the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Search Locator. In November 2022, a multi -media campaign was deployed to provide education and awareness to the direct support opportunities available through this grant and the RCAW pilot project; additional information on the campaign can be found under the Outreach Material section of this report. Produce /Participate in New Outreach Material and Outreach Events The Arkansas Lifespan Respite information lives within webpages attached to the Arkansas Department of Human Services' Division of Provider Services and Quality Assurance webpage. There is one main Page | 10 page for Arkans as Lifespan Respite with child pages related to vouchers, training, respite search locator/worker registry, and caregiver resources.

A letter informing them of the program and key activities and benefits, along with copies of the voucher and respite training/registry brochures, were mailed out to 259 superintendents and 1,068 principals across the state; only 22 letters were returned as undeliverable (an overall 98% deliverable rate). Year 3 of the grant is expected to contain another mailout campaign targeted doctors and physicians across the state. In Year 1 of the grant , the Arkansas Department of Human Services' Communications Department produce d a Caregiver Video that highlights one Arkansas caregiver's story and the benefits of respite. A t that time, a casting call was put out on the Arkansas Department of Human Services' social media accounts looking for caregivers to participate. The video was published on August 8, 2022, with DHS sharing the video on its social media platforms. The purpose of the video is to use testimony from Arkansas caregivers who have used respite in the past and discuss overall respite care needs, and the services and supports that the Arkansas Lifespan Respite grant currently provide. During this reporting period , the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition in partnership with Arkansas Department of Human Services' Communication Department build an outreach and awareness campaign to span several different mediums and have statewide reach . Within the multi -media campaign, three (3) vendors were used to produce the following products: digital ads, billboard ads, print/newspaper ads consisting of messaging around respite voucher opportunities and respi te training opportunities . Page | 11 Digital Ads The Arkansas Department of Human Services contracted with Cumulus C -Suite to provide a selection of digital graphics and animations with key respite messages deliverable to a targeted audience in rural/underserved cou nties via digital means (smartphones, smart TVs, computers, tablets, etc.). Digital advertising consisted of Search Engine Marketing (SEM), Advanced Targeting Display (ATD), Pre -Roll Advertising, Contextual Targeting, Social Media pay -per-click, and Site R etargeting. SEM Targeting utilizes keyword searches across search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo to target an audience with match phrases and words. Through this targeting, it can be set to show to people within certain geographical areas, certain times of the day or week, and who fit certain demographic categories. ATD uses voice recognition, location services and online searches to identify target customers and immediately serve the ad during an online experience. Pre-Roll Advertisements are a video advertisement that automatically play directly before a featured video on both mobile and desktop devices. These ads are commonly 15 to 30 seconds long and van be targeted to an audience based on interest, age, gender, location and more. Contextual Targeting is used to pair advertisements with relevant content that someone is browsing or reading. These ads are placed on web pages depending on the content of those pages, rather than data about the consumer's online behavior. Social Media pay -per-click is a form of internet advertising where the ad is paid for by the number of clicks it receives. In this case, social media pay -per-click was placed on the social media app Facebook. Facebook PPC ads can be used in a variety of spots on Facebook, includin g the sidebar, desktop or mobile newsfeed, and audience network. The Facebook PPC also ties into an audience's Instagram feed, another social media app connected to Facebook, for additional exposure. Site Retargeting helps recapture the interest of potential viewers after they leave your selected website. When viewers visit your site, in this case the Arkansas Lifespan Respite webpage, a retargeting pixel is placed in their browser. The pixel identifies potential viewers and enables you to serve them with tailored ads that relate to the content they were viewing on your webpage. Research has shown that site retargeting can improve click -through rates by up to 400%. Billboard Ads The Arkansas Department of Human Services contracted with Lamar Advertising to strategically place billboard ads in rural/underserved counties with key respite messages. A total of 18 billboards were scheduled across the state with a potential of 1.2 million views expected weekly. 14 of the 18 billboards (78%) were located in rural/u nderserved counties. Billboards were rotated based on regions with the following schedule: Billboard Active Date Range City Locations November 28, 2022 - December 25, 2022 Pine Bluff, Malvern, Hot Springs, Sheridan, Dumas, El Dorado Page | 12 December 26, 2022 - January 22, 2023 Lonoke, Warren, Monticello, Truman, Stuttgart, Harrisburg January 2, 2023 - January 29, 2023 Russellville, Carlisle, Perryville, Morrilton, Clinton, Searcy Print Ads The Arkansas Department of Human Services contracted with Arkansas Press Association to place a 2\"x4\" advertisement in local newspapers and magazines in rural/underserved counties with key respite messages. This print campaign consisted of three (3) run dates of October 10, 2022; November 14, 2022; and December 12, 2022 , within 88 participating newspapers (consisting of 17 dailies, 65 weeklies, and 6 shoppers). Of those 88 papers, 66 are located in rural and underserved counties, consisting of a 75% rural/underserved coverage area with an approximately one (1) million vi ews expected. During the reporting period, the quarterly respite and caregiver newsletter that was established as an outreach and awareness tool in the previous semi -reporting period , continued . The newsletter release schedule anticipates all four quarte rs- Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer editions, and is released via email to those subscribed, as well as posted to the Arkansas Lifespan Respite webpage. The following editions have been circulat ed during this reporting period : FALL 2022- October 22, 2022 WINTER 2022 - Delayed ; expected in February 2023 During the reporting period, five outreach events occurred. On July 11 , 2022 , a representative from the Arkansas Department of Human Services joined one of the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition members during an Alzheimer's and Dementia Advisory Council meeting to discuss respite activities and programs currently offered in the st ate. On August 8, 2022, the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition was on the agenda to present about respite activities and programs to the 2022 annual Arkansas State Independent Living Council (SILC) conference. In September, two outreach events were held w ith the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Council be in attendance to present brochures, pamphlets, and other information. These events included the 2022 University of Central Arkansas (UCA) Volunteer Fair (September 6, 2022) and the Arkansas Democrat Gazette Welln ess Expo (September 24). On November 14 -15, 2022, the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition and the Arkansas Department of Human Services held the 2022 Arkansas Caregiver and Respite Conference. This two -day event was a hybrid model, consisting of in -person meetings and presentations with an option of joining virtually. Topics included understanding what is respite, the basics of Medicare and how to navigate Medicaid, an introduction into Arkansas' PASSE (Provider -led ...) Program, an overview of the Alzheimer' s and Dementia Pilot Project and several self -care events including dealing with stress, compassion, managing expectations, etc. Day Two of the event included three panel discussions - the first from experts in the field of Long -Term Care in Arkansas, the s econd on Workforce Solutions, and the third as a panel discussion from caregivers with their personal stories, tips, and tricks. The Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition also received a Governor's Proclamation for the event that proclaimed November 2022 as Page | 13 Lifespan Respite Awareness Month. This proclamation was on display during the event and included a conference introduction video by then Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson who welcomed the guests and introduced his proclamation. At the conclusion of the conf erence, the first ever Arkansas Lifespan Respite Awards and Recognition Ceremony was kicked off. Prior to the conference, notifications were sent out via the Arkansas Lifespan Respite website, and DHS social media platforms allowing the public to nominate caregivers and caregiving organizations. The following categories were handed out to the following people/organization: Family Caregiver of the Year - Deneice Stout Young Adult/Youth Caregiver of the Year - Madison Respite and Caregiving Visionary A ward- Theba Jerilyn Swalve -Wasson Caregiving Organization of the Year - Community Connections What was produced during the reporting period and how have these products been disseminated?

The ads are placed on web pages depending on the content of those pages, rather than data about the consumer's online behavior.Unlike conventional advertising, contextual ads are cost -effective and don't need a heavy advertisement. Contextual advertising allows you toreach the right audience, as ads areposted after research on keywords and keywords phrases.By using contextual advertising, internet users who are looking for a certain keyword will click on the links on the website page to get more information. Contextual advertising allows users to get exactly what they're looking for without too much effort searching for a certain keyword.Contextual advertising gives the marketer a way of determining if their ads are bringing in revenue.The web visitors find the information on the links and ads helpful as they are related to what they're looking for. They get the information without having to search for the product and services actively.Budget friendly Targeted trafficBoosts sales User satisfactionMeasurableAbility to engage with customers Contextual Targeting vs. Behavioral Targeting Contextual ad targeting takes into consideration the state of the user/audience at the time the ad is served, as opposed to leveraging historical information about that specific user's interests. Behavioral targeting gathers data from multiple sources to form a picture of a user's online shopping history and browsing tendencies and ties that data to a unique identifier.What is Facebook Pay -Per-Click?The Benefits of Facebook PPC Facebook Pay -Per-Click is a form of internet advertising where a company pays a platform only when the ad is clicked.

Site Retargeting helps you to recapture the interest of potential customers after they leave your website. When potential customers visit your site, a retargeting pixel is placed in their browser. The pixel identifies your potential customers and enables you to serve them tailored ads that relate to the content they viewed on your site. Research shows that Site Retargeting can improve click -through rates by up to 400%. A small, unobtrusive piece of code is placed on your website (this code is sometimes referred to as a pixel). The code, or pixel, is unnoticeable to your site visitors and will not affect your site's performance. The code drops an anonymous browser pixel each time a new visitor accesses your site.

In early 2010, the Housing and Urban Development Department required that Conway stop rehabilitation of homes until policies and procedures were updated, documented and approved by the Little Rock HUD Field Office. Those actions were completed in late 2011, and the program restarted with funds from 2009. The new contract allows CAPCA to spend an additional $70,000 on housing rehabilitation. Former State Sen. Stanley Russ of Conway spoke recently to the ninth-grade civics class at St. Joseph School. Russ, who served from 1975 to 1999, was invited by teacher Betsy Beacham to address the relevance of the U.S. Constitution in today's society. 25 years ago Mr. and Mrs. William Ross Johnson of Quitman celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary at a reception at Mount Pleasant Methodist Church. Hosting the reception were members of the Quit- man High School Class of 1971. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson were married Oct. 11, 1947, in Conway. They have lived south of Quitman in the Mount Pleasant community ever since. Mrs. Johnson, the former Geneva Flowers, is a retired mathematics teacher, having taught at Quitman High School for more than 25 years. Mrs. Johnson is an Army vet- eran of World War II and was a prisoner of war in Germany. He is retired after 26 years at the Inter- national Shoe Co. and six years at Universal Nolin in Conway. The Johnsons have a son, the late Billy Ross Johnson, and two grandchildren, Eric John- son and Amanda Johnson. 50 years ago The morning and afternoon sessions of the kin- dergarten of the First Baptist Church visited a rice farm outside Conway owned by Emmet Torian. The children watched the combining and loading of rice. Picnic refreshments were served after- ward. Mrs. Charles McGibbony and Mrs. Bob Courtway were the teachers, and Jim Oquin drove the church bus. Conway's water supply problems moved a giant step nearer solution recently. A joint House-Senate conference in Washington, D.C., gave approval to a public works proposal which included authority for creation of a new water supply impoundment at federal expense. The news was greeted with happiness by Conway officials who have been working several years on solving the problem of protecting the city's water from pollution by river water and at the same time keep it fresh and clean. When Toad Suck Ferry Lock & Dam was completed, river water backing up behind it also backed up Cadron Creek and prevented the creek from flowing normally. This caused Conway's water supply to essentially stop flowing.Compiled by Colleen Holt | Log Cabin staff writer By JORDAN WOODSON Log Cabin Democrat From Conway Police De- partment reports Broken contact On Oct. 6, police respond- ed to a call in reference to a violated protection order. Police spoke to the call- er who said that she had a protection order against her ex-boyfriend. She said that the two of them were at court that morning and once the trial was over, he attempted to contact her via phone call and text message. She said that he called and then im- mediately sent a text saying that he didn't mean to call her, but then proceeded to ask when they were going to get back together. He also asked her why she didn't drop the charges against him in court. Spray paint cameras Also on Oct. 6, police re- sponded to a call in reference to a theft of property at Mid- town Storage. The caller said that he was reviewing cam- era footage from the previ- ous night and saw a man and a woman enter a code to a storage facility and walk in- side. He said that he saw the couple spray paint lights and cameras around the lot be- fore stealing from inside the unit. He said it was unclear what was taken from the unit at the time of the report. Jordan Wooodson can be reached at jwoodson@thecabin.netPOLICE BEATKori Bartholomew was a shining light. Her beautiful smile and gentle spirit warmed the hearts of her family and friends like the golden glow of a beautiful sunset. Her true beau- ty and genuine kindness some- how always managed only to spotlight those she loved, never bringing attention back to herself. The radiance of her life is re/f_l ected in her adoring husband, beautiful children and precious grandchildren. \"And her shining light will not be ex- tinguished, no matter how dark the night.\" (Proverbs 31:18) Kori Danielle Bartholomew was born at a naval base hos- pital on the island of Guam on Feb. 21, 1974, but she and her family soon moved to Rus- sellville, Arkansas, where she grew up alongside her siblings. Childhood friends remember Kori's sweet spirit and delight- ful smile, even as a child. Kori graduated from Russellville High School in 1992 and went on to attend Arkansas Tech Uni- versity in Russellville, earning a Bachelor's Degree in Health Physical Education in 2000. Her life's work revolved around loving and taking care of her family and serving others. For the past eight years, she worked in the front of/f_i ce at Conway High School, where she em- bodied a mother's love to 2200 students each school year. Kori passed away Friday, Oct. 7 in Conway, Arkansas, leaving behind an enormous legacy of love and a huge void in the hearts of everyone who knew and loved her. Kori was known for her daz- zling smile and her big hugs. Throughout her life, she was \"that person\" for so many of her friends- the one they called every day at lunch just to chat, the one they talked to about struggles, rejoiced with in cel- ebrations, laughed with about parenting, and counted on whenever they needed some- one. You could always /f_i nd Kori on the sidelines of the volleyball court and soccer /f_i eld, encour- aging her girls and supporting their teams however she could. She loved caring for her chil- dren and their friends, most of whom considered Kori a \"sec- ond mom.\" Her fellow moms quickly realized Kori to be a trusted friend to them as well. Teachers, staff, and students at Conway High School counted on Kori for daily smiles and encouragement...and a piece of old-fashioned candy! She kept a candy jar of \"old school\" strawberry and caramel treats for students who came through the of/f_i ce. This simple, sweet gesture along with Kori's signa- ture smile served as a constant and important reminder to all students that they were cared for and loved. Kori's family was her abso- lute world. She is survived by her soul mate and husband of 18 years, Chris Bartholomew; her daughters, Drew, Hali, Bel- la and Addie; and son, Jude; as well as two beautiful grand- sons, Malachi and Micah. Also surviving Kori are her parents, Angie Jackson of Russellville and Ron and Betty Thomason of Bella Vista; her sister, Natalie (Ryan) Cook of Prairie Grove; her brother, Adam Thomason of Fort Smith; her father and mother-in-law, Ed and Sherri Bartholomew; and numerous extended family members, including beloved nieces and nephews, and former/current students of Conway High School, whom she loved like family. Services for Kori will be held Tuesday, Oct. 18 at New Life Church in Conway (633 South Country Club Road) with visi- tation from 10 a.m.to noon and funeral service at noon. Conway High School will honor Kori's life with a \"Purple Out\" at Friday's Homecoming game and festivities. Fans are asked to wear her favorite col- or purple as the CHS football players \"#playforkori.\" Thomas \"Tom\" Francis Don- ovan passed away peacefully at his home with his sister, Ann, by his side, on Wednes- day, Oct. 12, 2022, from a pulmonary embolism.

I felt something dark and sinister in my soul. When I awakened, I could see only darkness - blackness everywhere. You were no longer at my side. I called out your name again and again but you did not answer. God had taken you away. I must not give up - never, never give up - no never. I called again and again and again at the top of my voice. One more time I tried and then I heard a tiny voice, a familiar voice. \"Is that you?\" I shouted. \"Yes\" came the reply. \"Where are you. I can't see you!\" \"I am here. Look up. Look around you.\" \"Look at your children. Look at your grandchildren and your great-grandchil- dren.\" I began to look hard and then I began to see. First I could see your beau- tiful eyes,Then your ruby lips with the taste of honey. Then there was a nose, an ear, an eyebrow, and even a crooked toe. I could see the hair that I caressed when you were so, so young. Slowly all of you appeared. The beautiful you of our youth, the most gorgeous creature that ever lived. I have found you my love and I will never lose you again! Love, ErnestNever By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS CAPE CANA VERAL \u2014 Four astronauts returned to Earth in a SpaceX capsule Friday, ending their nearly six-month space station mis- sion with a splashdown in the Atlantic off Florida. Wet and windy weather across Florida delayed their homecoming. SpaceX and NASA /f_i nally gave the all- clear on Friday, and the three Americans and one Italian de- parted the International Space Station, their residence since April. The capsule parachuted into the ocean, just off Jackson-ville, Florida, about /f_i ve hours later. It carried NASA astro- nauts Kjell Lindgren, Bob Hines and Jessica Watkins, the /f_i rst Black woman to com- plete a long-term space/f_l ight, and the European Space Agency's Samantha Cristo- foretti. SpaceX delivered their replacements last week. Before checking out, the astronauts said they couldn't wait to have a cold drink with ice, eat some pizza and ice cream, take a shower, revel in nature and, of course, reunite with their families. NASA planned to hustle them to Houston once they were off SpaceX's recovery ship and back on solid ground. \"Getting the /f_i rst few hugs when we get back is really going to be awesome,\" Hines told reporters earlier in the week. Remaining aboard the space station are three Americans, three Russians and one Japa- nese.SpaceX ferries astronauts back to conditions apply.B4 Wednesday, October 19, 2022 The Courier By DAVID PITT Associated Press DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 The federal government announced Tuesday a pro - gram that will provide $1.3 billion in debt relief for about 36,000 farmers who have fallen behind on loan payments or face foreclo - sure. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the farm loan relief program funded from $3.1 billion set aside in the Inflation Reduction Act allocated toward assisting distressed borrowers of direct or guar - anteed loans administered by USDA. The law was passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden in August. The USDA provides loans to about 115,000 farmers and livestock producers who cannot obtain commer - cial credit. Those who have missed payments, are in foreclosure or are heading toward default will get help from the USDA. Financial difficulties for farmers may be caused by a variety of is -sues including drought and transportation bottlenecks. \"Through no fault of their own, our nation's farmers and ranchers have faced in - credibly tough circumstanc - es over the last few years,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. \"The fund - ing included in today's announcement helps keep our farmers farming and provides a fresh start for producers in challenging positions.\" About 11,000 farm bor - rowers delinquent on di - rect or guaranteed loan payments for 60 days or longer are receiving auto - matic electronic payments to get them current on their loans. Each farmer with a direct loan received about $52,000 and those with guaranteed loans received about $172,000. The total cost for this group is nearly $600 million. Farmers who received this help will get a letter informing them that their payments have been made and they will remain current until their next an - nual payment is due in 2023, Vilsack said.USDA announces $1B debt relief for Last Chg %Chg %ChgTHE MARKET IN REVIEW STOCKS 11 7. 1 6 15.60 +.29 -36.6 AMD 1 .60 2.8 21 .72 1. 2 15 145.99 +4.45 -10.8 Apple Inc s .92 .6 24 ... ... ... .08 -.07 +8.3 Dillards .80 .3 6 EastChem 3.04 4.0 8 ExxonMbl 3.52 1. 0 21 167 .89 +2.14 -17 .9 Intel 1 .46 5.6 4 25.87 -.55 IBM 6.60 5.4 20 .88 3.5 ... 24.99 1. 2 .19 4.1 16 Trinity .92 3.9 41 23.74 +.58 -21 .4 Tyson 1 .84 2.8 8 65.70 19 201 .64 +3.04 1 .92 4.5 10 22.6 3 13.64 0 .06 9.2 ... .68 2.3 9 29.85 Close: 3,719.98 Change: 42.03 (1.1%) 10 DAYS MONEY RATES CURRENCIES Prime Rate Discount Rate Federal Funds Rate Treasuries 3-month 6-month 5-year 10-year 1 .5885 1 1.1319 1 .1361 Canada 1 Pvs Day British pound expressed in U.S. dollars.

Randy Baker CommodoreFairfield Bay Yacht Club Hold Last Lake Event By Mark Buffalo Sports Editor The No. 2 Carlisle Bison rallied from two scores down in the sec-ond half to beat Mineral Springs 32-28 in the first round of the Class 2A state playoffs at Fred C. Hardke Field. With the win, Carlisle will host Earle in the second round this Friday. The Bulldogs beat Bigelow in their first-round game. In Friday's win over Mineral Springs, Carlisle trailed 28-16 in the fourth quarter fol-lowing a 62-yard run by Katrevion Thomas with about eight minutes left in the game. Carlisle responded when Jason Sullivan scored on a seven-yard run. Holden Jones added the two-point conversion to pull the Bison to within four at 28-24. The Bison took their first lead of the game with less than two min-utes remaining when Sullivan scored on a short run, then added the two-point conversion to make the score 32-28. \"I was proud of them for hanging in there and battling back,\" Carlisle coach Caleb Shock said. \"In the first half, Mineral did a good job of executing their stuff and was able to get up on us early. I was proud of our kids being able to come in at halftime and being able to listen to some tough things that they got told, make some corrections after halftime. Them doing that says a lot about their character and their ability to be able to take coaching and make adjustments and play differently in the second half.\" The score was tied 8-8 after one quarter. The Hornets scored first then Jones scored on a one-yard run. Sullivan added the two-point con-version. Mineral Springs scored two touchdowns in the second quarter to lead 22-8 at halftime. Carlisle scored the only touchdown of the third quarter on a five-yard run by Cory Linz. Sullivan added the two-point conversion. Sullivan finished with 151 yards rushing on 24 carries. Jones had 41 yards on 12 carries. He also completed 2 of 4 passes for 12 yards. David Hayes and Gabe Boyle each caught a pass. Friday's game against Earle kicks off at 7 p.m. at Fred C. Hardke Field. \"Like Mineral Springs, Earle is bigger than us and is faster than us,\" Shock said. \"I think we've got guys who play really hard and try to make up for the measur-ables with some immea-surables. That is some-thing we'll have to do on Friday to win.\" Page 4 - The Grand Prairie Herald - Wednesday, November 16, 2022 111 Highway 70 East Hazen, AR 870-255-4538 P .O. 370, Hazen AR 72064 web site: www.herald-publishing.com email: heraldpublishing@gmail.com If you're not subscribing to The Grand Prairie Herald you're missing out on the GRAND PRAIRIE'S BIG NEWS The news about you, your family, your community, your friends and neighbors; news you won't get anywhere else!

Three of the four teams from the 2A-4 won their games, including Hazen, Carlisle and England. \"The conference with Des Arc must be pretty good,\" Besancon said. \"They swept the first round. I wasn't real shocked with Earle beating Bigelow. I think the playoffs are wide open.\" Besancon said Marked Tree will present his team some problems in the second round. They've got a ton of skill guys,\" he said. \"They've got good size up front. They've got a lot of speed. They mixed it up pretty good. They keep it pretty balanced.\" (Editor's note: Tickets for all playoff games must be purchased online from AAA. Eagles advance to second round with rout of Rattlers By Mark Buffalo Sports Editor The Des Arc Eagles took care of business early, beating the Magazine Rattlers 46-6 in the first round of the Class 2A state playoffs Friday at Hinson-Rollins Field. With the win, Des Arc will face Mount Ida in the second round this Friday in Des Arc. In the win over Magazine, the Eagles led 40-6 at halftime. Trevion Reed led Des Arc with 122 yards rushing and three touchdowns on five car-ries. Jack Kearby had 32 yards rushing and a touchdown and two two-point converisons. Daviyon Bell had 70 rushing yards, a touch-down and a two-point conversion. Cache Flanagan had 38 yards and a two-point conver-sion. Brady Boudreaux had 77 yards rushing, a touchdown and a two-point conversion. Defensively, the Eagles created five turnovers. Ross Ingle recovered two fumbles. Getting inter-ceptions were Kearby, Walker Harris and Ty Tallent. \"We were just taking care of business,\" Des Arc coach Brandon Barbaree said. \"They [Magazine] was playing in the playoffs just like everyone else. We want-ed to play our best. Early on, we did. We got a little sloppy at the end.\" Mount Ida is 8-2 after beating Episcopal Collegiate 40-13 in the first round of the play-offs. \"They are very similar to us,\" Barbaree said. \"They run the ball and try to maintain the clock, try to ground and pound. It may be the shortest football game in the state this week.\" The Des Arc Eagles enter the field prior to their game with Magazine in the first round of the Class 2A state playoffs on Friday.

Declare his glory among the nations, his wondrous works among all the peoples.\" 1 Chronicles 16:23 I bet you've been hearing a lot about Thanksgiving lately. If you're a kid, you've probably been learning about the history of the rst Thanksgiving or may- be you've had a party or two. If you're an adult, you've probably been preparing for your very own Thanksgiving. This time of year can get really hectic with family gatherings and activities that sometimes we forget to slow down and really focus on being thankful. I woke up this morning with a song in my heart. I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice. To worship You. Oh, my soul, rejoice! Take joy my King in what You hear. Let it be a sweet, sweet sound in Your ear. As I sang that song to myself this morning and enjoyed the heat of my home on this cold morning, I was so thankful for the joy of just having some quiet time with God to tell him thank you for all that He's done in my life. The busier things get, the less I'm able to do that. The less I do that, the less I remem-ber all the things He has done in my life. So I'm making it up in my mind to carve out time with the Lord during this busy season no matter what. I don't want Thanksgiving to pass me by without really deciding in my heart all of the many things I have to be thankful for. So what about you? How can you make an e ort to slow down and really take note of what God has done for you? Can you wake up a little early to read your Bi-ble or Pray? Is it saying no to just one activity to spend more time with family? What about going outside and enjoying His cre-ation instead of spending time on technology? We have so much to be thankful for, let's take the time to really enjoy it and show God our thankfulness! \"Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his faithful love endures forever.\" 1 Chronicles 16:34 | advancemonticellonian.com ADVA NCE -MONTICELLONIAN3BFAITHWednesday, 870-367-5325editor@monticellonews.net CHILDREN'S DEVOTIONAL DHS HAS RESPITE OPPORTUNITIES: Vouchers to pay for respite care -up to $1,200 a year!

Written by Clement C Moore, the poem will be 200 years old in 2023. Some of the visitors were the grandchildren of the Von Kanels of Mike's Nursery here in FFB. Xi Gamma Kappa celebrated the Christ-mas season at Bayside Resturant Wednes-day December 7, 2022. We gave gifts to the children on the Angel tree instead of our secret sister this year. It was rewarding to do something for the communities children. The pictures seemed re - assuring: Hundreds line the road at Tehran, Iran's main airport, cheering and chant - ing Elnaz Rekabi's name as the minibus carrying her slowly weaves through the jubilant crowd. \"Hero, El - naz!\" cries the throng of men and women, young and old, gathered outside the termi - nal, their rhythmic and thun - dering claps echoing across a neon-lit forecourt. The hero's welcome in the early hours of Wednesday for Rekabi, an athlete who was a relatively obscure figure in the international sports climbing world until a few days ago, was documented in video footage that was wide - ly circulated on social media and on Iranian news outlets. Concern for Rekabi had flared after she made global headlines Sunday for climb - ing at an international tour - nament without a hijab, de - fying Iran's strictly enforced dress codes for female ath - letes. That action thrust her into the center of the protest movement in Iran, in which women have taken center stage in the anti-government rallies. Iran has been gripped by protests since September, in what has spiraled into the biggest challenge to the Islamic Republic in more than a decade. The demon - strations were ignited by the arrest and subsequent death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was accused by the country's mo -rality police of wearing her hijab too loosely. The police have denied reports that she was beaten while in deten - tion, saying that she suffered a heart attack, although her family says that she was healthy when she was ar - rested. Against that backdrop, Rekabi's motivations, and her fate, remain unclear. As Rekabi landed in Teh - ran, footage from an Iranian agency, Borna News, showed her being embraced by her family. Their reunion ap - pears warm, though perhaps subdued, with a few con - cerned gazes. \"Let's go, let's go,\" says a man as he ush - ers Rekabi away, grabbing a bouquet of flowers that had been handed to her. The man's identity and relation to Rekabi are unclear. In an interview on state- run television, Rekabi ap - peared calm but serious, cov - ering her hair with a black baseball cap and hooded sweatshirt. \"I apologize to the Ira - nian people for the tension I caused,\" she said. \"Thank God nothing has happened yet.\" Rekabi denied reports that she had gone missing in recent days and repeated a claim posted Tuesday to an Instagram account connect - ed to her that she had only forgotten her hijab. \"It happened totally unin - tentionally,\" she told report - ers. The New York Times was not able to verify whether Rekabi had made the Insta - gram post herself. Iran has been widely criticized by rights groups in the past for forcing activists to publicly make coerced confessions. Although it remains un - certain whether her compet - ing without a hijab act was deliberate, if the footage from the airport is any guide, many Iranians appear to have already made up their minds and adopted Rekabi as a he - ro of the country's protest movement. Rekabi said that she in - tended to continue compet - ing. \"There is no goodbye. I will continue as long as I can continue according to my beliefs,\" she said in the interview with state-run TV . She was then whisked away from the airport. The Times was unable to confirm her destination or current whereabouts. Amid a brutal crackdown by Iranian security forces, at least 240 protesters have so far been killed, including 32 children, and nearly 8,000 others have been arrested, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.ISSN 1060-4332 USPS 031-400 Published daily and Sunday by Northwest Arkansas Newspapers, LLC, 212 N.

Big Hit Mu - sic said the band's oldest member, Jin, will revoke a request to delay his conscription. The six other BTS members also plan to enlist and are \"looking forward to reconvening as a group again around 2025 follow - ing their service commitment,\" the company said. The band members performed together in Busan over the weekend in support of the city's EXPO bid, which will be their last concert as a group until they finish their military service, according to their label. Jin and the others will receive five weeks of combat training before being assigned to units and duties, according to officials of the Military Manpower Administration, who stressed that the singers will be treated the same as other South Korean men. While the country's military for years had assigned enlisted entertainers to duties related to producing radio and TV material promoting the mil - itary, the \"entertainment soldier\" system was retired in 2013 after complaints over fairness. Jin turns 30 in December, the age at which men can no longer delay enlistment. The other members are between 25 and 29, with Suga turning 30 in March. The band \u2014 its other members being J-Hope, RM, Jungkook, V and Jimin \u2014 launched in 2013 and has a legion of global supporters who call themselves the \" Army.\" After building a huge following in Asia, BTS expanded its popularity in the West with its 2020 megahit \"Dynamite,\" the band's first all-English song, which made it the first K-pop act to top Billboard's Hot 100. m Russell Crowe , who won a best actor Academy Award for his role in the 2000 film \"Gladiator,\" was feted recently by the city of Rome, home to the Colosseum \u2014 where real gladia - tors clashed before thousands of spec - tators through the time of the Roman Empire. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri welcomed the actor to City Hall, which sits atop the ancient Capitoline Hill, stepping out on a balcony with Crowe to show off a sweeping view of the an - cient Roman Forum. Crowe was given a plaque and the title of \"ambassador of Rome in the world.\" The actor, speaking Italian, said, \"I am always at the service of Rome.\" In the film, Crowe portrayed Maximus, who was a general forced into slav - ery before turning into a gladiator. Crowe was in Rome for the city's film festival, where a movie he directed and stars in, \"Poker Face,\" had its world premiere ahead of its Nov. 16 theatrical release. The mayor said the city was giving the plaque \"as the symbol of friendship and affection of Rome for Russell Crowe.\" CroweNames and faces The members of BTS arrive at the Grammy Awards in Las Vegas on April 3. (AP/Invision/Jordan Strauss)Astronaut awed by Mother Earth Support of family, tribe buoy first American Indian in space CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 The first American Indian woman in space said Wednes - day she is overwhelmed by the beauty and delicacy of Mother Earth, and is chan - neling \"positive energy\" as her five-month mission gets underway. NASA astronaut Nicole Mann said from the Inter - national Space Station that she's received lots of prayers and blessings from her fami - ly and tribal community. She is a member of the Wailacki of the Round Valley Indian Tribes in Northern California. Mann showed off the dream catcher she took up with her, a childhood gift from her mother that she's always held dear. The small traditional webbed hoop with feathers is used to of - fer protection, and she said it's given her strength during challenging times. Years be - fore joining NASA in 2013, she flew combat in Iraq for the Marines. \"It's the strength to know that I have the support of my family and community back home and that when things are difficult or things are getting hard or I'm getting burned-out or frustrated, that strength is something that I will draw on to continue to - ward a successful mission,\" Mann told The Associated Press, which gathered ques - tions from members and tribal news outlets across the country.Mann said she's always heeded her mother's advice on the importance of positive energy, especially on launch day. \"It's difficult for some peo - ple maybe to understand be - cause it's not really tangible,\" she said. \"But that positive energy is so important, and you can control that energy, and it helps to control your attitude.\" Mann, 45, a Marine colonel and test pilot who was born in Petaluma, Calif., said it's important to recognize there are all types of people aboard the space station. It's current - ly home to three Americans, three Russians and one Japa - nese astronaut. \"What that does is it just highlights our diversity and how incredible it is when we come together as a human species, the wonderful things that we can do and that we can accomplish,\" she said. While fascinated with stars and space as a child, Mann said she did not understand who became astronauts or even what they did. \"Unfor - tunately, in my mind at that time, it was not in the realm of possibilities,\" she said. That changed later in her career. Now, she's taking in the sweeping vistas of Earth from 260 miles up and hop - ing to see the constellations as she encourages youngsters to follow their dreams.0 As for describing Earth from space, \"the emotions are absolutely overwhelming,\" she said. \"It is an incredible scene of color, of clouds and land, and it's difficult not to stay in the cupola [lookout] all day and just see our planet Earth and how beautiful she is, and how delicate and frag - ile she is against the blackest of black that I've ever seen \u2014 space \u2014 in the background.\" Mann rocketed into orbit with SpaceX on Oct. 5. She'll be up there until March. She and her husband, a retired Navy fighter pilot, have a 10-year-old son back home in Houston. The first American In - dian in space, in 2002, was now retired astronaut John Herrington of the Chickasaw Nation.MARCIA DUNN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Astronaut Nicole Mann , a Marine colonel and test pilot, shows her dream catcher Wednesday during an interview from the International Space Station.

(AP/IRNA)Covid vaccine kept wrong, N.D. told THE ASSOCIATED PRESS BISMARCK, N.D. \u2014 The North Dakota Health Depart - ment stored thousands of covid-19 vaccine doses at in - correct temperatures or with - out temperature data over the past two years, according to a state audit that says some of the vaccine was administered to patients. The health department disputed the findings Tues - day. Tim Wiedrich, who heads the agency's virus response, said \"no nonviable vaccine\" was given to patients. In re - sponses that accompanied the audit, the department said clerical errors or other errors of documentation erroneous - ly suggested that expired or bad doses were given. The Health Department \"uses redundant systems to ensure proper monitoring and distribution of vaccines prior to end of shelf life,\" the agency said. A spokeswoman for the auditor's office said it wasn't recommending revaccina - tions. \"We simply report on what we found,\" auditor's office spokeswoman Emily Dalzell said. \"It would be up to the individual and their doctor to decide if revaccination is needed.\" The state analysis said nearly 2,000 Moderna doses were stored at incorrect tem - peratures and were adminis - tered to patients. The audit also found that nearly 13,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine were issued from storage with missing temperature data. Statement of core values \"To give the news impartial- ly, without fear or favor.\" (Adolph Ochs, 1858-1935). Impartiality means report- ing, editing, and delivering the news honestly, fairly, objective-ly, and without personal opinion or bias. Credibility is the greatest asset of any news medium, and impartiality is the greatest source of credibility. To provide the most complete report, a news organi-zation must not just cover the news, but uncover it. It must follow the story wherever it leads, regardless of any precon-ceived ideas on what might be most newsworthy. The pursuit of truth is a noble goal of journalism. But the truth is not always apparent or known immediately. A journal-ist's role is therefore not to determine what they believe at that time to be the truth and reveal only that to their readers, but rather to report as complete-ly and impartially as possible all veriable facts so that readers can, based on their own knowl-edge and experience, determine what they believe to be the truth. When a newspaper delivers both news and opinions, the impartiality and credibility of the news organization can be questioned. To minimize this as much as possible there needs to be a sharp and clear distinction between news and opinion, both to those providing and consum-ing the news. \"A newspaper has ve constituencies, including rst its readers, then advertisers, then employees, then creditors, then shareholders. As long as the newspaper keeps those constit-uencies in that order, especially its readers rst, all constituen-cies will be well served.\" (Walter Hussman, 1906-1988) \u2014 20, 2022 www.ar.gov/arlifespanrespiteDHS HAS RESPITE OPPORTUNITIES: Vouchers to pay for respite care -up to $1,200 a year!

The system's investment return for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was minus 4.41%, said Brianne Wey - mouth of the San Francis - co-based Callan investment consulting firm. That ranked in the bottom 41% among similar public pension sys - tems in the nation. However, the value of the public employees retirement system's investments has rebounded since Sept. 30 to about $10.14 billion, said Car - los Borromeo, the system's chief investment officer. The public employees re- tirement system is the state government's second-largest retirement system, with more than 80,000 working and re - tired members. On Wednesday, the sys- tem's Board of Trustees voted to keep the rate charged to state and local governments at 15.32% of their payroll in fiscal 2025, which starts June 1, 2024. They also directed Callan officials to propose a pacing schedule for the sys - tem to begin making private equity investments over the next several years. In August, trustees decid- ed not to reduce the rate it charges state and local gov - ernments to 15.17% of payroll in fiscal 2025 as the system's working members, who con - tribute into the system, begin paying higher percentages of their salary into the system over the next several years. In fiscal 2022, which end- ed June 30, the system's state and local government em - ployers paid $320.8 million into the system, while the system's working members paid $81.2 million into the system, according to a sys - tem report. The system's working members paid 5% of their sal - ary into the system in fiscal 2022 and began paying 5.25% of their salary into the system effective July 1, under Act 365 of 2021. Act 365 will increase the percentage of salary that a member pays from the for- mer 5% rate by 0.25% a year over an eight-year period until the rate reaches 7% of salary. As of June 30, the sys- tem included 42,771 working members with an average an- nual salary of $45,020, a 7.8% increase over June 30, 2021, the system's actuarial firm of Gabriel, Roeder, Smith & Co. reported. The system included 41,390 retirees, including those in the deferred retire-ment plan, with total annual benefits of $671.2 million or an average of about $16,216 a year, as of June 30, according to Gabriel. There are 1,426 deferred retirement plan members with a total payroll of $93 million, or about $65,217 a year, as of June 30. INVESTMENT VALUES According to Callan, the system's investment perfor-mance in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 included: A $200 million decline in the value of the system's do- mestic stock market invest - ments to $3.52 billion. A $223 million drop in the value of the system's inter - national stock market invest - ments to $2.13 billion. An $85 million decline in the value of the system's do- mestic bond investments to $1.79 billion. A $32 million drop in the value of the system's real assets \u2014 real estate, timber, energy and farmland invest - ments \u2014 to $1.55 billion. A $10 million slip in the of the system's diversified strategy investments to $482 million. Last quarter's investment losses came on the heels of the system's investments falling in value by $1.5 billion to about $10 billion in fiscal 2022 amid declining stock and bond markets. The system's overall in- vestment return in fiscal 2022 was minus 10.54% and ranked in the bottom 32% among similar public retire - ment systems across the na - tion, Callan reported to the board in August. The median investment return among the system's peers across the na-tion in fiscal 2022 was minus 9.35%, according to Callan.The $1.5 billion drop in the value of the system's invest - ments in fiscal 2022 came af - ter the system's investments benefited from robust mar- kets and increased by $2.5 billion in value to $11.6 billion in fiscal 2021, which ended June 30, 2021. The system's investment return in fiscal 2021 was 31.49%. The system's current target investment return is 7.15%. Over the last five years the system's investment return has averaged 5.28% a year to rank in the top 36% of sim- ilar public pension systems, according to Callan. Over the last 10 years, the system's investment return has averaged 7.36% a year to rank it in the top 27% of sim-ilar public pension systems. The trustees on Wednes- day opted to direct Callan officials to develop a pacing schedule for how much the system would allocate during each of the next several years for private equity invest - ments \u2014 putting the system on track to eventually invest 5% of its investments in pri- vate equity investments. Private equity invest - ments are long-term private unlisted investments in op- erating companies, typical-ly accessed through limited partnerships, and have the potential to outperform pub-licly traded investments in stocks and bonds, John Jack - son of Callan told the sys-tem's Board of Trustees. An allocation of 5% to 10% of the system's investments for private equity is support - ed by the system's liquidity profile, according to Callan's written report to the system's Board of Trustees. Trustee Jason Brady said he is a strong proponent of the public employees retire-ment system's beginning to invest in private equity, based on his experience with pri- vate equity investments made by the Arkansas Teacher Re- tirement System. Trustee Andrea Lea, who is the state's auditor, said it makes sense for the public employees retirement system to invest in private equity. She said she has served on the board for eight years, and she questioned why this is the first time that the sys- tem's board is considering private equity investments. Weymouth said the board didn't express an interest in pursuing private equity in- vestments in 2019. She said Callan presented the trustees with options for the system in invest in private equity and for its investment portfolio to keep the same overall investment risk. Under one of these op- tions to place 5% of the sys-tem's investments in private equity, the system would increase its target for total investments in the domestic stock market from 33% to 35% and increase its target for fixed income investments from 18% to 20%. It would also reduce its target in the international stock market from 24% to 19%; ax its 4% target for convertible bonds; and keep its 16% target for re- al assets and its 5% target for diversified strategies. Under the system's asset valuation method, market gains and losses are phased in and recognized over a four- year period, with the aim of avoiding swings in the em- ployer rate charged to state and local governments, ac-cording to the system's actu-arial firm of Gabriel, Roeder, Smith & Co. As of June 30, the system's actuarial accrued liabilities totaled $12.23 billion and an actuarial value of the system's assets totaled $10.22 billion, leaving unfunded liabilities of about $2 billion, and the system's funding ratio is 84%, according to Gabriel. The system had the same funding ratio on June 30, 2021. The projected period for the system to pay off its un- funded liabilities is 14 years on June 30, down from 16 years on June 30, 2021. Ac - tuaries often compare the projected payoff period for unfunded liabilities to a mortgage on a house.The ban, titled the Save Adolescents From Experi- mentation (SAFE) Act, was passed as Act 626 of 2021 by Republican lawmakers over a veto by Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who said at the time that he opposed the law because it lacked any provision to grandfather in patients already receiving care. Arkansas was the first state to enact such a ban, which has been opposed by a number of profession- al medical associations and business groups and has drawn sharp criticism from medical groups around the nation. The American Med- ical Association and the American Society of Pedi- atrics are two organizations that have opposed the law. The law was challenged in a suit filed in April 2021 by the American Civil Liber- ties Union on behalf of four transgender teens and their families living in Arkansas and two physicians, Mi-chele Hutchison and Kath- ryn Stambough. It named Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, Arkansas State Medical Board Direc- tor Amy Embry and the 14 members of the medical board as defendants. The lawsuit contends the law vi- olates the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment and free speech protections un- der the First Amendment. In July 2021, just a week before the law was to go into effect, Moody issued a temporary injunction blocking it from being enforced while the matter is in court. Last August, a three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit upheld Moody's injunction, prompting Rutledge's re- quest for a hearing before the full court. The law \u2014 authored by Republican state Rep. Robin Lundstrum of Elm Springs and passed on primarily par- ty line votes \u2014 would pro- hibit doctors from providing transgender young people care related to gender dys - phoria and would also pro-hibit doctors from making referrals for such care. Gender dysphoria is de- fined by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., as the feel-ing of discomfort or distress that might occur in people whose gender identity dif - fers from their sex at birth or sex-related physical char- acteristics. The trial began last month and is set to resume Nov. 28. The state's petition was denied Wednesday by Cir- cuit Judge Steven Colloton with Chief Judge Lavenski Smith and Circuit Judge Duane Benton concurring. \"Whatever the merits of the panel opinion,\" Col-loton wrote in his opinion, \"this case is not appropriate for rehearing en banc in its current procedural posture. The present appeal concerns a preliminary injunction en - tered in July 2021 as to which there has been no request for a stay by the State in fifteen months. The case is now in the midst of a trial in the district court that is scheduled to conclude in less than a month, on De - cember 1, 2022.\" Colloton wrote that once the case is decided in district court, \"an appeal from the final judgment will present this court with a compre - hensive record developed af - ter more than ten months of discovery and a full trial, as opposed to the preliminary record that is before the court in the present appeal.\" Dissenting in the opinion were Circuit Judges Ray - mond Gruender, Ralph Er - ickson, Steven Grasz, David Stras and Jonathan Kobes. In his dissent, Stras wrote that with the the trial ongo - ing, the possibility exists that the issue could become moot before an appeal could be completed. Even so, he said, taking up the matter would be worth the risk considering an opinion by the full court will \"frame the debate in the future, if not effectively decide any later appeal.\" Stras wrote that even if the case were never to come back to the Eighth Circuit, \"we may be dealing with its far-reaching conse - quences for years to come.\" A spokeswoman for Rut - ledge said in a statement that the denial by the Eighth Circuit was for procedural reasons and that \"a majority of the court invited Arkansas to appeal again once the trial at a lower court is complet - ed.\" Amanda Priest said if the state does not prevail in the bench trial before Moody, it will appeal. \" Arkansans can rest as - sured that Attorney Gener - al Rutledge will continue to wholeheartedly defend the SAFE Act because it protects children from the experi - mental life-altering proce - dures,\" Priest said. Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Ar - kansas, said in a prepared statement the ACLU will continue its opposition to the law \"until every trans - gender youth in Arkansas knows they deserve safety, dignity, and respect.\" Calling the law, \"base - less and cruel,\" Dickson expressed gratitude to the court for allowing the lower court ruling to stand. \" Arkansas should be a safe place to raise all chil - dren \u2014 transgender youth included \u2014 and denying them life-saving health care does the exact opposite,\" Dickson said. \"We are look - ing forward to completing our final trial on the merits and hopeful for a permanent injunction.\"MICHAEL R.

Y0143_4002_01_M_CY2023of evidence that long covid can be fatal,\" said Ziyad Al- Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University and chief of research and development at VA St. Lou - is Health Care System. \"Let's not trivialize it or say it's all in people's heads.\" The deaths were identi - fied from information en - tered on death certificates in the National Vital Statistics System \u2014 a methodology that experts, including the study's authors, cautioned could result in a large under - count. \"Death certificate data is fraught with uncertainty and ambiguity, something acknowledged by the CDC,\" said Francesca Beaudoin, head of the Brown Universi - ty School of Public Health's Long Covid Initiative. In the case of long covid, those problems are compounded by varied definitions and terminology as well as cli - nicians' familiarity with the condition, she said. There was no diagnostic code for long covid until October 2021. Nonetheless, the study reflects the need for further research into long covid and potential treatments, experts said. As many as 1 in 13 adults, or 7.5% of the U.S. popula - tion, are experiencing symp - toms that last three or more months after contracting the virus, according to the CDC. The diagnosis is often associated with cognitive impairment, or brain fog, breathlessness, fatigue and coughing. But many patients report debilitating pain, rac - ing heartbeats and severe neurological tremors. Oth - ers have symptoms linked to prolonged treatment on ventilators in intensive care, which can lead to extreme weakness and mental health disorders triggered by the experience. Benjamin Abramoff, di - rector of the Post-COVID Assessment and Recovery Clinic at Penn Medicine, cautioned that it is difficult to draw conclusions from the study without additional de - tails about the patients' med - ical histories and the severity of their covid infections. \" A death at weeks follow - ing severe infection leading to covid pneumonia and hospitalization paints a dif - ferent picture than deaths in non-hospitalized patients months following infection,\" Abramoff said. Some patient advocacy groups have been docu - menting suicides attributed to long covid. \"I doubt most coroners are even familiar with the definition of long covid, let alone the coding,\" said Diana Guthe, who founded Survivor Corps. \"Not a week goes by that I don't hear of another suicide due to long covid, but I have yet to hear of a single one of those deaths labeled long covid.\" Al-Aly, who wrote an April 2021 paper that used Veterans Affairs data to demonstrate increased risk of death in the post-acute phase of covid, said the study should be in - terpreted in the context of its limitations. The cause of death list - ed on a death certificate is usually documented as the closest event, Al-Aly said. If a 35-year-old dies of a heart attack or stroke three months after having acute covid, the death is not likely to be coded as long covid, he said. The numbers of long-covid-related deaths will probably grow as med - ical education and use of long-covid codes and docu - mentation increase, said Han - nah Davis, co-founder of the Patient-Led Research Collab - orative. She also noted that the highest number of deaths came in 2022. \"This communicates that the risk of long covid and deaths from long covid will increase as long as infections continue,\" Davis said. DEATHS TRENDING DOWN The number of U.S. deaths dropped this year, but there are still more than there were before the coronavirus hit. Preliminary data \u2014 through the first 11 months of the year \u2014 indicates 2022 will see fewer deaths than the previous two covid-19 pandemic years. Current re - ports suggest deaths may be down about 3% from 2020 and about 7% vs. 2021. U.S. deaths usually rise year-to-year, in part because the nation's population has been growing. The pandemic accelerated that trend, mak - ing last year the deadliest in U.S. history, with more than 3.4 million dying. If current trends continue, this year will mark the first annual decline in deaths since 2009. It will be months before health officials have a full tally. The October and No - vember numbers are not yet complete and a late-De - cember surge could change the final picture, said Farida Ahmad, who leads mortality surveillance at the Centers for Disease Control and Pre - vention. If the decline does hold, it will still be a far cry from where the nation was before the coronavirus appeared. This year's count is likely to end up at least 13% higher than what it was in 2019. \"We're [still] definite - ly worse off than we were before the pandemic,\" said Amira Roess, a George Ma - son University professor of epidemiology and global health. Once again, most of the annual change is due to the ebb and flow of covid-19, which has killed more than 1,080,000 Americans since it first was recognized in the U.S. in early 2020. This year started off hor - ribly, with about 73,000 covid deaths in January alone \u2014 the third-deadliest month from covid-19 since the pandemic began. For 2022, \"the bulk of mortality was concentrated during that omicron wave at the beginning of the year,\" said Iliya Gutin, a University of Texas researcher tracking covid-19 mortality. Monthly covid-19 deaths dropped below 4,000 in April and averaged about 16,000 per month through November. The monthly av - erage for 2021 was more than double that. Covid-19 will neverthe - less end up as the nation's third-leading cause of death this year, just as it was in 2020 and 2021 \u2014 behind the perennial leader, heart dis - ease, and cancer. Heart disease deaths, which have tended to surge in tandem with covid-19 deaths, are on track to be down from 2021, Ahmad said. And it's not clear whether the number of cancer deaths will change, based on prelim - inary data. There may be some rela - tively good news regarding drug overdose deaths, which hit an all-time high last year. Provisional overdose death data posted by the CDC on Wednesday \u2014 through the first seven months of this year \u2014 suggests overdose deaths stopped climbing early this year, around last winter's end. Also Wednesday, the CDC released its first report on deaths involving long covid \u2014 long-term symptoms after a person has recovered from coronavirus infection. The CDC estimates that about 3,500 deaths from January 2020 through June 2022 in - volved long covid. That's about 1% of deaths in which covid was deemed the under - lying or contributing cause. Experts believe pharma - ceutical weapons against the coronavirus have been making a difference. The Commonwealth Fund this week released a modeling study that concluded the U.S. covid-19 vaccination program prevented more than 3.2 mil - lion deaths. \"We all really would ex - pect that the number of deaths \u2014 and the number of severe cases \u2014 would de - crease, due to a combination of immunity from natural infection and vaccination ... and treatment,\" Roess said.

(AP/The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal/Thomas Wells) PARCHMAN, Miss. \u2014 A man who pleaded guilty to raping and killing a 16-year- old girl was put to death by lethal injection in Mississip - pi on Wednesday, becoming the second inmate executed in the state in 10 years. A coroner pronounced Thomas Edwin Loden Jr., 58, dead at 6:12 p.m. at the Mis - sissippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. The manner of death had been the subject of Loden's final attempt to stave off the execution. He has been on death row since 2001, when he pleaded guilty to capital murder, rape and four counts of sexual bat - tery against Leesa Marie Gray. Earlier this month, a federal judge declined to block Mis - sissippi from carrying out the execution amid a pend - ing lawsuit from Loden and four Mississippi death row inmates over the state's lethal injection protocol. Mississip - pi's most recent execution was in November 2021. Loden wore a red prison jumpsuit and was covered by a white sheet during the exe - cution. Brown leather straps held him down on a gurney. Before the injection start - ed, Loden said he was \"deeply remorseful.\" \"For the past 20 years, I've tried to do a good deed every single day to make up for the life I took from this world,\" Loden said. \"If today brings you nothing else, I hope you get peace and closure.\" He concluded his last words by saying \"I love you\" in Japanese, officials said. During the summer ahead of what should have been Gray's senior year of high school, she had worked as a waitress at her uncle's restau - rant in northeast Mississip - pi. On June 22, 2000, she left work after dark and became stranded with a flat tire on a rural road. Loden, a Marine Corps re - cruiter with relatives in the area, encountered Gray on the road about 10:45 p.m. He stopped and began speaking with the teenager about the flat tire. \"Don't worry. I'm a Marine. We do this kind of stuff,\" he said.Loden told investigators he became angry after Gray said she would never want to be a Marine, and that he ordered her into his van. He spent four hours sexually as - saulting her before strangling and suffocating her, according to an inter - view he gave investigators. Court re - cords show that on the afternoon of June 23, 2000, \"Loden was discovered ly - ing by the side of a road with the words 'I'm sorry' carved into his chest and apparent self-inflicted lacerations on his wrists.\" After pleading guilty in September 2001, Loden told Gray's friends and family during his sentencing: \"I hope you may have some sense of justice when you leave here today.\" Wanda Farris, Gray's mother, described her daugh - ter as a \"happy-go-lucky, al - ways smiling\" teenager who aspired to become an elemen - tary school teacher. \"She wasn't perfect, now, \"But she strived to do right.\" Farris had planned on attending the execution Wednesday. \"Clearly, something in him snapped for him to commit such a horrific crime,\" said Mitzi Magleby, a spokes - person for the Mississippi chapter of Ignite Justice, an organization that advocates for criminal justice changes. \"Mr. Loden was immediately remorseful. Shouldn't there be room for grace and mercy in such a situation?\" Farris told The Associated Press on Friday that she for - gave Loden years ago, but she did not believe his apology. \"I don't particularly want to see somebody die,\" Farris said. \"But I do believe in the death penalty. ... I do believe in justice.\" Information for this article was contributed by Emily Wagster Pettus of The Associated Press.MICHAEL GOLDBERG THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Loden Unit chief let go at Mississippi base THE ASSOCIATED PRESS BILOXI, Miss. \u2014 The U.S. Air Force has removed the commander of a key train - ing unit at a Mississippi air force base, saying leaders no longer had confidence in his abilities.

We had individuals storming the Capitol here and defacing public buildings and private entities and hurting one another. We've got to stop that violence and go back to civil discourse. We can never have civil disobedience and accom - plish what we need to in the United States of America.\" Despite the amicus brief she filed in the aftermath of the 2020 Election, Rutledge said she has made multiple state - ments saying Joe Biden was the President and won the 2020 Election. \"When it comes to Joe Biden, [we shouldn't look] at when he was elected,\" Rutledge said. \"Rather, [we should look at] what he's done since he's been president. I've taken over 100 legal actions against this presi - dent for his illegal actions.\" Krout, however, called the le - gal actions Rutledge mentioned \"frivolous.\" \"[The legal actions against the president] are a use of our taxpayer dollars,\" Krout said. \"I wish people were paying at - tention to that because it's not helping our state.\" Candidates also took time to discuss which of the four ballot issues Arkansas voters are set to consider in November are most important to them. All three had different answers. For Gilbert, Issue Four, the legalization of recreation - al marijuana constitutional amendment is most important. He said he hates some facets of the amendment, namely how it only allows for a set amount of marijuana cultivators, but sup - ports it because of the young people he sees who are arrested for simple marijuana posses - sion. \"As a driver for Uber and Lyft, one of the most frequent jobs I have is not just the airport [or] the Amazon Fulfillment Center, but the probation department,\" Gilbert said. \"Folks, it breaks my heart to see that many young people's lives disrupted in that way.\" Rutledge encouraged all Ar - kansans to do research on all of the ballot issues, but spoke longer on Issue Two without announcing her support for it. Issue Two is the ballot initiative that would require 60 percent of voters to approve constitutional amendments for them to pass and become part of the state's constitution. The issue, passed by the Ar - kansas State Legislature in the 2021 session for voters to con - sider, keeps in place the simple majority it takes the legislature to pass issues to go to voters, while increasing the threshold for voters to approve issues, most notably issues that are proposed by Arkansans. Rut - ledge said the Arkansas Consti - tution has been amended more than 100 times, a number she considers high. She said the state's constitution should be hard to amend. \"We don't want [amending the constitution] to be some - thing that's done 'willy-nilly' with out-of-state money com - ing in to influence, buy elec - tions and change our constitu - tion,\" Rutledge said.She also spoke about Issue Three, the religious freedom amendment backed by State Sen. Jason Rapert and State Rep. Jimmy Gazaway. If passed, the amendment would add a section in the State Con - stitution that prohibits state and local governments from bur - dening the practice of religion unless there's a compelling rea - son to do so. \"When it comes to religious liberty, we're going to keep do - ing that in Arkansas,\" Rutledge said. \"I have done it as your Attorney General and we will always defend our religious lib - erty rights.\" Krout seemed to speak against Issue Three, saying that Arkansans already have religious freedom as they live in the U.S. She also spoke in opposition to Issue Two, saying that it's already a challenge for citizens to bring issues to state - wide election ballot. \"For us to try to make it even more cumbersome to pass leg - islation through a citizen ini - tiative, I find very concerning and I honestly see it as kind of an insult to the voters of Arkan - sas that the legislature doesn't think that [citizens] can come up with good enough ideas that should be passed at the same 50 percent threshold that the leg - islature is able to pass,\" Krout said. \"This actually puts us in a scenario where minority rules, where the 40 percent could get to decide whether or not some - thing passes. I think that's just wrong.\" Later, Krout expanded on her thoughts on Issue Two in her post-debate news conference, saying that Rutledge's sugges - tion that amending the Arkan - sas Constitution is easy doesn't make sense to her. \"I believe, in the last 20 years, we've only seen seven citi - zen-led initiatives become add - ed to the Arkansas Constitution, so [the idea that adding amend - ments to the constitution is easy] is simply not true,\" Krout said. \"A 60 percent threshold doesn't make any sense in a democracy. Fifty percent-plus one is what passes all of our other laws, it's how we elect our leaders [and] it makes sense that that is how we add to the Arkansas Constitution.\" Discussing education, all three candidates brought for - ward different visions for im - proving equitable education for all Arkansas students. Gilbert advocated for the complete dissolution of the state's De - partment of Education in his post-debate news conference and said the state has failed to adequately advocate for stu - dents. \"Why do we allow govern - ment to control our children's education?\" Gilbert said. \"It's something that came to us from the Prussian school system ear - ly in our national history and I don't think it's something that's enshrined in the [U.S.] Consti - tution ... There are better, more efficient ways to provide edu - cation for children than having the state government, a county school board and three or four local school boards all within the same county.\" Gilbert said parents and pri - vate entities should be responsi - ble for educating children, and \"shopping [education] out\" to the government is \"dangerous.\" Krout said public schools need more funding beyond the property taxes currently allotted to support schools, as well as an increase in teacher pay. She also spoke on School Choice and described the state's annual budget as a \"moral document\" that \"shows what we care about.\" \"We have got to be making sure public funds stay with public schools,\" Krout said. \"All children should be able to have access to the same oppor - tunities here.\" Rutledge rebutted Krout's comments on School Choice, saying that parents have to have a choice on where to send their children to school to ensure stu - dents get a quality education. \"A child shouldn't be held back by their parents' zip code or income,\" Rutledge said. Pivoting away from School Choice, Rutledge said the state needed to do more work to pro -vide alternative education that doesn't involve higher educa - tion like workforce programs. \"For too long, we've told young people that you're either going to college or you're going to jail,\" Rutledge said. \"That's a terrible plan to put them on. Let's make sure that we are let - ting students leave high schools with the tools necessary to get a job.\" In one of the last topics of Tuesday's debate, the candi - dates discussed whether they considered their potential po - sition as Lieutenant Governor a full-time job and if they'd require security and additional funding to complete the tasks of the office. Gilbert, who ear - lier in the debate said the po - sition he's currently running for should likely be abolished entirely, described what his typ - ical morning would look like if he were elected Lieutenant Governor. \"I would probably get up in the morning, check the newspa - per, local radio and television, and see if the governor had been indicted or died overnight,\" Gil - bert said. \"If not, I'd probably roll over and go back to sleep. We don't need a $46,000 a year featherbed job.\" Gilbert said he'd use his posi - tion as a bully pulpit to encour - age the passage of the Arkansas Township Amendment to allow people who live in townships across the state the ability to form their own assemblies for conducting local affairs. \"The [Arkansas Township Amendment] gives us the op - portunity to bring governance to the people,\" Gilbert said. \"It allows our motto, 'The People Rule,' to actually be taken seri - ously for a change.\" Krout said she can work hard as Lieutenant Governor, while making it a part-time job. She said she'd use the office to ad - vocate for Arkansans, specifi - cally mentioning the foster care system, having served as a fos - ter parent for years. \"I think there's a huge lack of awareness about what we can do to improve the foster care system,\" Krout said. \"At any given time, we have upward of 5,000 kids in foster care [and] there's not nearly enough fam - ilies [to take them].\" Krout said she wasn't sure whether she'd need security, saying that she does well travel - ing around the state now with - out a security detail. \"I am really looking forward to just being able to be a voice for Arkansans,\" Krout said. \"I'm not looking to make this position any more complicated than it already is.\" Rutledge said she doesn't do anything \"halfway\" and that she will put \"that same effort into being Lieutenant Gover - nor that I've done as Attorney General.\" Saying the Lieu - tenant Governor's Office will be \"more efficient,\" she said her office will have to \"work hard, get up early and stay up late.\" Later, in her post-debate news conference, Rutledge said the Arkansas State Police provides security for the Lieutenant Governor's Office if the Lieu - tenant Governor requests it. Citing the threats she's received over the past eight years as At - torney General, Rutledge said it's important to protect elected officials. Friday is the last day of PBS debates, with gubernatorial candidates Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Democrat Chris Jones and Libertarian Ricky Dale Harrington Jr. set to square off at 10 a.m. A few hours later, at 1 p.m., Republi - can incumbent U.S. Sen.

Daniel Craig returns as the renowned detective Benoit Blanc as he gets invited to a trip to Greece alongside a tight-nit group of rich and powerful friends. When one of them turns up dead, Detective Blanc must once again peel back the layers of another complexed mystery. If you know me at all, you'd know that whodun - nits are my favorite genre of film. They are the most engaging type of films and I always have the most fun while watching them. \"Knives Out\" was my favorite of 2019, a year that was already filled to the brim with fantastic additions to cinema, and has become a movie that I watch every single year. Needless to say, the sequel to that film has been one of my most anticipated movies pretty much ever since I finished watching the first one in that theater almost exactly three years ago. I, admittedly, had set way too high expec - tations for this movie and going in, was very nervous that I might have overhyped myself on it. Yet somehow \"Glass On - ion\" found a way to exceed my already ridiculously high expectations for it. Rian Johnson clearly knows what he's doing and has quickly become a master of the genre. With the previous film, he was able to do what he always does and subvert expectations of the genre to make the 2019 whodun - nit story feel exciting and fresh, but he takes that to a completely other level here. He completely bends, flips, folds and shatters the entire genre with how he has chosen to tell this extremely engaging story and it's in - credible to see unfold before me, layer after layer. I view \"Knives Out\" as a perfect film, but this film is even more shocking, twisty, engaging and hilarious than the last. I had my theories and thought I had an idea about what was going to happen here before going in based on the first trailer for the film that was released by Netflix months ago, but man was I completely wrong on pretty much any plot point. Even while watching the film, I had no idea what was going to be around the next corner which had me on a chokehold at the edge of my eat. Rian Johnson is extremely clever and witty in his writing, it's why he got an Oscar nomination for the first film and its why he deserves it once again for this masterpiece. Johnson knows the genre better than anyone oth - er than probably Agatha Christie herself and even then, they may even be on the same level. He clearly loves writing and making these types of films and that translates right on the screen. It was probably just as much as a blast making this movie for him as it will be for audiences to experi - ence it, whether at home on Netflix or in the theater for Thanksgiving. He is taking clear inspiration from the 1973 whodunnit \"The Last of Sheila\" written by Anthony Perkins and Ste - phen Sondheim, one of my favorite whodunnits ever. He loves this genre just as much as I do and it makes me love this movie even more because of it. This mystery is so clever, unlike anything I've seen be - fore. The title, based on the Beatles song, really comes into play has each layer of this whodunnit onion gets peeled as the film goes on. Each reveal is so well done and Johnson knows exactly when to reveal what and when to focus on something in particular. There are a lot of great callbacks in this film that Johnson uses so clever - ly. Moments that I initially thought were small, quirky character moments come into play later on that made me look back and question everything I saw previous - ly. Johnson is an absolute genius. Back in the summer of 2021, I remember going on Twitter and seeing the cast announcements for this sequel one day at a time and I kept getting even more excited after every single one because this really is a stacked cast. Netflix gave Johnson a lot of money to make this money and even in the cast alone you can see the money well spent. Every single person in this ensemble from Kathyn Hahn's (\"Wandavision\") Claire Debella, a politician running for Senate, to Dave Bautista's Duke Cody, an Andrew Tate-type of Twitch influencer, to Edward Nor - ton's Miles Bron, an Elon Musk billionaire type, brings it their all and Johnson does a great job giving every character, even the ones with smaller roles, something to do to make them stand out. But the two in the cast that really stand out are Janelle Mon\u00e1e and, of course, our favorite detective Daniel Craig. Daniel Craig has quickly really gotten ahold of this character and truly understands it in just the second film more so than he ever did with James Bond (and he was already fantastic as James Bond). He is clearly having fun with this character and that comes off clear as day. As for Janelle Mon\u00e1e, they are the heart and emotional center of this story and they deliver a fantastic performance. I have been a fan of theirs for awhile now but this is truly the best performance of their career. It's a complex role that takes a turn halfway through and they pull off this switch flawlessly. \"Glass Onion\" is a triumph of a whodunnit sequel that I personally can't wait to watch over and over again. It also just makes me excited for the next Knives Out film and makes me want 10 more of these because I frankly can't get enough. \"Glass On - ion\" comes to select theaters for one week only starting Nov. 23 before arriving on Netflix one month later on Dec. 23, but I highly recom - mend seeing it in a theater if you can because the experience of laughing and gasping with an audience is unmatched.

Marvin, assistant pro- fessor of chemistry at Hendrix College, recently received a grant from one of America's oldest foundations, Research Corporation for Science Advancement, to explore the use of visible light to drive chemical reactions among a set of organic - or carbon-based - molecules. His approach may one day hold great potential for creating a more environ- mentally friendly, energy efficient chemi- cal industry. 25 years ago Alvin and Pauline White of Beebe cele- brated their 50th wedding anniversary at a reception on Nov. 15.

The property manger told police that a man came to the apartment complex around 1 a.m. and went up to his old apartment. The man kicked the door down and went inside, according to the report. The property manger is unsure why the man came to the apartment, but they found footprints near the attic space. He believes that the man climbed into the at- tic for some reason. No oth- er damage was done to the room. He said that he knows who the man was due to an anonymous resident inform- ing him that they saw him that night. Arresting call On Dec. 1, police respond- ed to a call in reference to a report of fraud. Police spoke to the caller who said that around 9:30 a.m. she got a call that was labeled with the misspelled \"FC Sher- riff\" and the man who spoke to her claimed to be \"Sgt. Connelly.\" The man on the phone told her that she had $2,000 of outstanding fees out of Faulkner County and that if she didn't pay them, she would be arrested.

By JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER Associated Press HONOLULU \u2014 Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike the so-called last Hawaiian princess whose lin- eage included the royal fami- ly that once ruled the islands and an Irish businessman who became one of Hawaii's largest landowners, died on Sunday. She was 96. Her death was announced Monday morning outside 'Io- lani Palace, America's only royal residence where the Hawaiian monarchy dwelled but now serves mostly as a museum. As it rained, Paula Akana, executive director of 'Iolani Palace, and Hailama Farden, of Hale O Na Ali'i O Hawai'i, a royal Hawaiian society, both walked down the palace steps and driveway to read the announcement in Hawaiian. A news release later said she died peacefully in her Ho- nolulu home with her wife, Veronica Gail Kawananakoa, at her side. \"Abigail will be remem- bered for her love of Hawai'i and its people,\" her 69-year- old wife said in a statement, \"and I will miss her with all of my heart.\" Kawananakoa held no for- mal title but was a living re- minder of Hawaii's monarchy and a symbol of Hawaiian national identity that endured after the kingdom was over- thrown by American busi- nessmen in 1893.\"She was always called princess among Hawaiians because Hawaiians have ac- knowledged that lineage,\" Kimo Alama Keaulana, as- sistant professor of Hawaiian language and studies at Ho- nolulu Community College, said in a 2018 interview. \"Ha- waiians hold dear to geneal- ogy. And so genealogically speaking, she is of high royal blood.\" He called her \"the last of our alii,\" using the Hawaiian word for royalty: \"She epito- mizes what Hawaiian royalty is - in all its dignity and intel- ligence and art.\" James Campbell, her great-grandfather, was an Irish businessman who made his fortune as a sugar plan- tation owner and one of Ha- waii's largest landowners. He had married Abigail Kuaihelani Maipinepine Bright. Their daughter, Abi- gail Wahiika'ahu'ula Camp- bell, married Prince David Kawananakoa, who was named an heir to the throne. Their daughter Lydia Kama- ka'eha Liliu'okulani Kawa- nanakoa Morris had Abigail with her husband William Jeremiah Ellerbrock. After the prince died, his widow adopted their grandchild, the young Ab- igail, which strengthened her claim to a princess ti- tle. She acknowledged in an interview with Honolulu Magazine in 2021 that had the monarchy survived, her cousin Edward Kawanana- koa would be in line to be the ruler, not her. \"Of course, I would be the power behind the throne, there's no question about that,\" she joked. Known to family and close friends as \"Kekau,\" she re- ceived more Campbell money than anyone else and amassed a trust valued at about $215 million. She funded various caus- es over the years, including scholarships for Native Ha- waiian students, opposing Honolulu's rail transit project, supporting protests against a giant telescope, donating items owned by King Ka- lakaua and Queen Kapi'olani for public display, including a 14-carat diamond from the king's pinky ring, and main- taining 'Iolani Palace. \"As a longtime benefac- tor for the Friends of 'Iolani Palace and many other Na- tive Hawaiian causes, Prin- cess Abigail's generosity and contributions have greatly bene/f_i ted our lahui,\" state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole and Rep. Daniel Holt, leaders of the Legislature's Hawaiian caucus, said in a statement, using a Hawaiian word that can mean \"Hawaiian com- munity.\" Gov. Josh Green ordered the U.S. and Hawaii state /f_l ags to be /f_l own at half-staff at the state Capitol and state of/f_i ces until sunset this Sun- day, saying \"Hawaii mourns this great loss.\" Critics have said because there are other remaining de- scendants of the royal family who don't claim any titles, Kawananakoa was held up as the last Hawaiian princess simply because of her wealth and honori/f_i c title. Hawaiian activist Walter Ritte said many Hawaiians aren't interested in whether she was a princess and that her impact on Indigenous culture was minimal. \"We didn't quite understand what her role was and how she could help us,\" Ritte said. Many Hawaiians couldn't relate to her, he said. \"We call it the high maka-maks,\" he said using a Hawaii Pid- gin term that can mean up- per-class.Kawananakoa, 'last Hawaiian princess' dies at 96By STEPHEN GROVES Associated Press SIOUX FALLS, S.D. \u2014 A massive winter storm blew toward the center of the U.S. on Monday, threatening mil- lions of people with heavy snow, freezing rain and /f_l ooding. The National Weather Service warned that there would be \"numerous, wide- spread, and impactful weath- er hazards in the heart of the country this week.\" Across the Rockies and into the northern Plains and parts of the Midwest, people were warned to prepare for bliz- zard-like conditions. Those farther south in Texas and Louisiana could get heavy rains with /f_l ash /f_l ooding, hail and tornadoes by Tues- day. The storm will continue southeast into Florida later in the week, forecasters said. \"It will be a busy week while this system moves across the country,\" said Marc Chenard, a meteorol- ogist at the National Weath- er Service's headquarters in College Park, Maryland. Of/f_i cials in western South Dakota told residents to brace for 6 inches or more of snow: \"Get your shovels handy, get your groceries, and check other needed sup- plies. The roads will be hard to travel.\" A swath of country stretch- ing from Montana into west- ern Nebraska and Colorado was under blizzard warnings Monday, and the National Weather Service said that as much as 2 feet of snow was possible in some areas of western South Dakota and northwestern Nebraska. Meanwhile, ice and sleet were expected in the eastern Great Plains. National Weather Service warned that up to about half an inch of ice could form and winds could gust up to 45 miles per hour in parts of Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota. Power outages, tree damage, falling branches and hazardous travel conditions all threatened the region. \"This is a 'we are not kid- ding' kind of storm,\" the South Dakota Department of Public Safety said in a tweet urging people to stock up on essentials, then stay home once the storm hits. Thousands of students from Native American com- munities across Wyoming, Nebraska and the Dako- tas were traveling to Rapid City, South Dakota, for this week's Lakota Nation Invita-tional, a high school athletic event. Brian Brewer, one of the organizers, said he had urged schools and partici- pants to travel early. \"We told them with this storm coming - if you leave tomorrow, there's a good chance you might not make it,\" he said Monday. In northern Utah, a tour bus crashed Monday morning as snow and frigid tempera- tures blanketed the region. The bus /f_l ipped onto its side in Tremonton after the driver lost control while switching lanes, the Highway Patrol said in a statement. The Highway Patrol said 23 pas- sengers were injured, includ- ing some seriously. The weather is part of the same system that dumped heavy snow in the Sierra Ne- vada over the weekend. In Northern California, most mountain highways had reopened Monday. Re- maining warnings in South- ern California mountains were expected to expire late Monday night, the National Weather Service said. With winter still more than a week away, it was the latest fall storm to bring signi/f_i cant precipitation to California, which is dealing with the im- pacts of years of drought that have spurred calls for water conservation.U.S. blizzard expected to impact millions in Rockies, Midwest Sarah A. Miller / Idaho Statesman Sal Wood, Blake Wood and Jacobi Wood, 6, roll the largest snow- ball at Camel's Back Park in Boise, Idaho, on Monday after 2.5 inches of snow fell overnight according to the National Weather Service.

Another garden team takes care of native plant collections at Tyler Bend Visitor Center and Buffalo Point Ranger Station, according to team leader Dwan Garrison of Yellville. \"\"We tend the gardens and often bring natives from our own gardens to swap. We are also very diligent about removing those pesky non-native Invasives, so that our visitors can appreciate the natural beauty of the Buffalo National River habitat that these gardens illustrate,\" Garrison explains. Both native and heritage Ozark plants are the focus of volunteers who work at Ozark Folk Center State Park, says team leader Nell Doyle of Norfork. \"We learn a lot about the historical and cultural uses of plants we see in the woods and along creeks in other volunteer work,\" says Doyle. \"Some are natives, but some were brought to the Ozarks by European settlers and are now a permanent part of the landscape.\" Kids' Team \"Children really love learning about nature,\" says Kids' Team leader Sally Brown of Lakeview, \"Whether it's getting to stroke the soft fur of a possum or learning to identify a raccoon's scat and tracks, they soak up all the nature facts we can give them.\" Kids' Team volunteers help state park and nature center staff present programs on site or in public schools. The team also designs its own programming at public libraries and schools. Facilities support Other volunteers help staff at state park and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission facilities with general maintenance, like painting and repairing signs, fences, and parking lots; cleaning kayaks and recreational equipment; and building and installing bird, bat and owl nest boxes.

It was held at the Donald Harder Post 48. The luncheon was catered by Corkie's BBQ. Hal Lovett, Commander of the Post was introduced by Norma Strabala, who told the veterans that she was hon- ored to feed and honor them on their day. She also told them she would do this every year, until she was no longer here to do it. Fourth graders from Park Avenue Elementary entered waving flags, then they sang several patriotic songs for the veterans. Teachers Jessi- ca Hosman, Staci Wheeler, Chelsea Hill, Bridget Neal and Morgan Walter helped the children prepare to sing. Boy Scout Troop #84 and leaders posted the colors and retired the colors. Those present were Brittney Powell, Zavior Powell, Dante Pow- ell, Michael Garrison, Jase Heath, Casey Knowlton and Fonda Logsdon. Several veterans told their stories about their service, including 98-year-old Calvin Bock, recipient of a Bronze Star, Two Purple Hearts and a French Liberation Medal. Bock served with the 84th Infantry Division, including the Battle of the Bulge fight. Jeremy Prine provided entertainment. There was 70 years of service at the lun- cheon, including one World War II veteran. World War II veterans die at a rate of 1700 per day. RSVP members Norma Strabala, Jennifer White, Maurine Stewart, Rose Ahrens, along with Meredith Lovett also helped provide each veteran with small gifts. Door prizes were given out to veterans as well as a token of appreciation for their service.

The FTC reported 2.8 million fraud reports from consum- ers in 2021 alone, with re- ported fraud losses increas- ing 70% from 2020 and more than $5.8 million. Scammers begin their tra- ditional uptick at the start of the holiday season, and iden- tity theft protection expert Carrie Kerskie says being aware of what new cyber and phone fraud trends to look out for is your biggest defense against unwanted fraud. \"The more that we can get this information out there the better, \" Kerskie recently told T-Mobile Stories, \"Un- fortunately when it comes to technology, privacy and identity theft, the same old advice that was given 10, 15 years ago is still the gospel of what you're supposed to do. And that is outdated. None of it works. It's not true, it's not relevant anymore. \" Scammers have expanded from targeting consumers with only traditional email and phone calls. The most recent trending scams are oc- curring using person-to-per -son payment platforms or P2P , remote access software and even public Wi-Fi. Kerskie says the most de- sirable accounts to criminals include bank accounts, mo- bile phone accounts, credit card accounts, and Amazon accounts. Now, with P2P payment platforms, criminals can get access to your bank account and use it to transfer money within moments. The latest tactic that con- cerns Kerskie is using remote access software to gain access to everything on your com- puter without having to di- rectly ask you for things like your social security num- ber, bank account or credit card number. While many workers use remote access software safely from their companies' IT departments, criminals are also using this software in their scams. Criminals also try to ac- cess your information in set- tings like coffee shops or li- braries using public Wi-Fi. A laptop or smartphone using public Wi-Fi can easily fall victim to scams. An easy fix is to use your smartphone's wireless data and hotspot to help keep your personal in- formation secure.Kerskie says there are ways to keep scammers and fraud at bay ahead of the holiday shopping season. Prioritize Privacy: Kerskie says, if it's easy for you, it's easy for a criminal. Privacy means having strong and unique passwords with a minimum of 12 characters, and for pins using random numbers and taking advantage of extra se- curity. Enabling multi-factor authentication on your var - ious apps and accounts will also protect yourself from potential threats. Use Available Resources: Take advantage of the free anti-fraud safeguards offered by your mobile carrier. In the case of T-Mobile's Scam Shield, services include en- hanced caller ID, scam ID and blocking, which flags suspicious calls and gives customers the option of blocking those numbers. Ad- ditionally, customers can get a free second number to keep their personal number per - sonal, or even change their primary number completely. Validate or Eliminate: Whatever potential threat you come across via email, text message, letter or even a phone call, try to validate the information. If you cannot confirm the information is true or confirm the senders' validity, throw it away, block the phone number or email address and report it as spam or junk mail. Understanding how po- tential cyber threats and fraud work will help protect you this holiday season and beyond.

As each of the students took their turn at the microphone, some were more at ease than others, and those who spelled their words incor - rectly were saddened as they were eliminated from the competition. In the sixth round, the top five students qualified to advance to the Arkansas County Spelling Bee. Each of the top five won a snack pack, 100 Dragon Dollars, and a Spelling Bee ribbon. With words like joggled, slather, traditional, and adorable, the competition continued until Allyn Smith won by correctly spelling the word exciting. The Top 5 Finalists were: 1st Place: Allyn Smith, 4th Grade 2nd Place: Anna Claire B., 4th Grade 3rd Place: Averi C., 4th Grade 4th Place: Austin C., 5th Grade 5th Place: Nehemiah D., 4th Grade W AITING FOR A FULL LIST OF STUDENTS WHO COMPETED IN THE SPELLING BEE Be a santa to a senior!

Anna Claire Beaton, Natalie Way, Bailey Claire HitchcockAmerican Red Cross Responds to Year of Crises This holiday season, donate financially, give blood or volunteer to help those in need LITTLE ROCK, AR [De - cember 12, 2022] \u2014 2022 has been a year of crisis for fam - ilies throughout the Missou - ri and Arkansas Red Cross Region, as well as across the globe \u2014 from flooding and tornadoes locally to ex - treme disasters such as Hur - ricane Ian, severe floods in Kentucky and wildfires out West; the ongoing conflict in Ukraine; and the first-ever national American Red Cross blood crisis in January 2022. \"Whether a crisis is felt by an entire community or a single person, it turns lives upside down \u2014 especially for the most vulnerable, \" Lori Arnold, Executive Director of American Red Cross serv - ing Greater Arkansas said. \"This holiday season, join us to provide help and hope for people in need during future emergencies by making a fi - nancial donation or volun - teering. \" During the holidays, visit redcross.org to make a finan - cial donation. Individuals can also register online for volun - teer opportunities. RESPONDING TO DI - SASTERS OF ALL SIZES This year's extreme di - sasters in the U.S. are clear examples of the increasing frequency and intensity of weather events. So far in 2022, 15 disasters, each cost - ing a billion dollars to re - spond to, have upended lives across the country \u2014 that's more than twice the number of billion-dollar disasters that struck annually two decades ago. For these and tens of thou - sands of other disasters in around the region and across the country, Red Cross vol - unteers have worked 24/7 to assist with emergency needs such as food, clothing, and a safe place to stay. In the Missouri and Ar - kansas Region, Red Cross volunteers have also provided relief and comfort after home fires and other local disasters, including responding to tor - nadoes that ripped across the two-state region, and flood - ing that impacted the St Lou - is area. Since January 1, 2022, more than 330 Red Cross disaster workers in the Mis - souri and Arkansas Red Cross Region have deployed to more than 30 events from coast to coast to help ensure no one faces a crisis of any size alone. Since January 1, 2022, nearly 3,200 disaster respons - es in the Missouri and Arkan - sas Region (primarily home fires, but also tornadoes, flooding or damaging wind events have resulted in more than 11,500 people receiving assistance in the region. In the area serving Greater Arkansas, about 650 disaster responses (primarily fires, but also floods, tornadoes, wind event responses), have resulted in Red Cross assist - ing nearly 2,100 people. HELPING FAMILIES AFFECTED BY GLOBAL EMERGENCIES Internationally, this year, as part of the world's largest humanitarian network, the American Red Cross pro - vided humanitarian aid in more than 108 countries. OVERCOMING THE FIRST-EVER RED CROSS BLOOD CRISIS In January 2022, the Red Cross experienced its worst national blood shortage in over a decade, due to on - going collection challenges and varied hospital demand during the pandemic. Pa - tients in need of lifesaving blood transfusions relied on an outpouring of support from hundreds of thousands of generous blood donors to overcome the crisis. The need for blood is con - stant, as one in seven patients entering a hospital will need a blood transfusion. Every day, Red Cross blood donors are the lifeline for car accident victims, parents with compli - cated childbirths, individuals battling cancer and people with sickle cell disease. To make an appointment to give blood this holiday season by visiting RedCrossBlood.org. In the Missouri and Ar - kansas Region, between Jan - uary 1 and November 30, 2022, more than 225,000 blood products have been collected due to the gener - osity of our blood donors. PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES Across the Missouri Ar - kansas Region, Service to Armed Forces workers have kept busy providing for mil - itary members, their families and veterans. Our SAF team in the Mis - souri and Arkansas Region opened over 4,000 critical community services cases since January 1, 2022, to as - sist service members and vet - erans with resources to take care of utility bills, car pay - ments, other special needs. We have also educated family members of deploying mil - itary and those entering the military about SAF emergen - cy communications services. Our SAF teams also sup - ported our veterans by dis - tributing nearly 30,000 per - sonal care and clothing items to needy veterans this past year.

The Sun Thursday, November 17, 2022 B3 Twists, themes, sound effects: Jigsaw puzzles for all ages By KIM COOK Associated Press Jigsaw puzzlers found their happy place, and their people, during the pandemic. Puzzling was already a thing, but soon more groups formed on social media, while pop- ular puzzles disappeared quickly from online and actual shelves. Sales for one big puzzle maker, Ravensburger, soared 370 percent year over year in the first cou- ple of weeks of lockdown in 2020. Inventories have mostly recovered, although there are still \"sold out\" tags on some sites. And even though many people have returned to pre-lockdown life, the love of jigsaw puzzles stuck around. We're still sorting and assembling, and getting that little kick when we successfully place a piece. Puzzle pros say assem- bling the border is the best way to start. Then sort by color, pattern and, in really big puzzles, section. (At this year's World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship in Spain, Alejandro Clemente completed a 500-piece puzzle in just over 34 minutes. Most people take between two and seven hours on that size puzzle.) This holiday season, in a world that seems anxious on many fronts, maybe a good gift would be a jigsaw puzzle. A few hours can be spent putting something together, with a beautiful picture the result. Call it piecing together some personal peace; puzzle therapy. Special interests One-thousand piece puzzles are perfect for confident puzzlers like Janet Rosen, a lawyer in Evanston, Illinois, who loved puzzling as a child and got back into it during the pandemic. A garden- er and reader, she was happy to receive a couple of hand-me-down puz- zles from a friend: one of vintage gardening books, by Ravensburger, another of classic British book covers. \"I like the challenge, and the concrete method of overcoming the chal- lenge,\" she says. At SeriousPuzzles.com, you'll find Cavallini & Co's gorgeous vintage illustrations of constella- tions, minerals, jellyfish, mushrooms and other collections, offered in gift-worthy reusable can- isters. Also at the site is a fun retro Christmas puzzle from Cobble Hill featur- ing midcentury holiday imagery. And the retailer offers a collection of dynamic, art- sy jigsaws from Puzzles of Color, a company started by Texas siblings Ericka Chambers and William Jones to promote artists of color. The puzzles are standard sizes when finished, so you can easily frame and display them. Some puzzlers like to sort by separating piece shapes. If that's you, you'll have fun with the lineup from Magic Puzzle Com- pany, a company kickstart- ed during the pandemic. The puzzles, set in scenes like a magical maze, a sunny cityscape or an island paradise, have surprise shapes like animals and clouds amidst the regular pieces. (Magic Puzzles also have a twist in each one, and without giving too much away let's just say it involves a separate bag of pieces you aren't meant to open until you've completed the main puzzle.) Puzzle lovers Jena Wolfe and Rachel Hochhauser, colleagues at a Los Ange- les creative agency, started the online shop Piecework a few years ago. They came up with the idea after Hochhauser was stuck during bad weather in a Yosemite rental cabin, and passed the time with a bunch of dusty old jigsaw puzzles she found in a cupboard. They wanted to design eye-catching and satis- fying thematic puzzles where the art takes center stage. \"We like to balance the components that make a great puzzle - variation in color, objects and tex- tures,\" Hochhauser says. \"We wanted to create jig-saws that someone would want to gift as a hostess present, or whip out after a dinner party to work on during dessert.\" Going a step further, the duo even created Spotify playlists to accompany many of their puzzles. A still life of moody flower heads gets a soulful, jazz- tinged playlist. One new one, Apres Ski, features '80s-era alpine gear, a fon- due pot and a snowy alpine backdrop. The playlist has a lot of Tears for Fears, TOTO, Flock of Seagulls and similar music to help set the Euro disco vibe. To create a personalized puzzle, using your own photos, try Minted. There are square and heart- shaped layouts, and it's a nice way to celebrate family members or a great vacation. For those planning a wedding, there are sweet little \"reveal\" puzzles in which you can ask the recipient to be a bridesmaid, ring bearer or other participant. Younger kids The folks at childrens' toy company Melissa & Doug have boxed sets of wooden puzzles marked for ages 3 and up. Choose from four dinosaurs or four household pets; the lid serves as an assembling tray, and the wood box makes for easy storage. The company's got jigsaws with sound effects, too, to delight the littlest puzzlers. Choose from a farm, firehouse, zoo, orchestra and more, in- cluding licensed character tie-ins. Large, colorful puzzles of the solar system or ocean floor would be fun to assemble: finished size is 2-by-3 feet, and the 48 pieces are big and sturdy. Older kids Puzzles shaped like a luscious cupcake, a feline friend, or a stack of books might appeal to middle and high school- ers. They're available at Galison, which also has a 500-piece, ble-sided puzzle featuring artist Romare Bearden's \"Jazz II Deluxe\" image on one side. On the other is a collage of images done by middle school students in the DreamYard in School Program, which provides residencies and after-school programs to Bronx public schools. At Woodbests, look for beautiful wooden puzzles in various sizes, of zodiac symbols, famous paint- ings, or animals, birds and dragons. Young travelers might like a bundled set of 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzles of Paris, London, New York and San Francisco, at Genuine Fred. Minted via AP A variety of personalized puzzles are offered by Minted. There are square and heart-shaped layouts, and you can pick black & white or color reproductions. It's a nice way to celebrate family moments. Melissa & Doug via AP A box set of wooden puzzles from Melissa & Can ' Avatar' wow again? By JAKE COYLE Associated Press NEW YORK \u2014 James Cameron has been living on Pandora for a long time. But 13 years after the orig - inal \"Avatar\" and five years after starting production on its sequel, \"The Way of Wa - ter,\" Cameron is unveiling the long-awaited follow-up to the highest grossing film of all-time. Speaking the day after \"The Way of Water\" debuted in London, Cameron - back on Earth and self-admittedly out of practice with the hoopla of a red-carpet premiere - de - scribes the experience of fi - nally having the movie out in the world \"surreal.\" \"You work on these films kind of in a bubble. You cre - ate this world around you with your artists, with your casts and so on,\" Cameron says. \"Then one day you re - alize, 'Oh crap, we're going to have to show this to peo - ple at some point.'\" For a long time, the \"Ava - tar\" sequel was the \"Waiting for Godot\" of blockbusters - more theoretical than real, with release dates that kept spiraling into the future. Meanwhile, an unending parade of pieces pondered the original's curious place in entertainment: a box-of - fice behemoth with little cultural footprint, a $3 bil - lion ghost. But the first look at Cam - eron's \"Avatar\" sequel has thrown some cold water on that notion. The over - whelming reaction to the director's latest three-hour opus? Never bet against James Cameron. With a reported price tag of more than $350 million, a third \"Avatar\" film already wrapped and two more films planned after that, the Walt Disney Co. is placing a very big wager, indeed, on \"The Way of Water.\" Cameron's latest - a deep- blue ocean epic of natural splendor, ecological protec - tionism and family perse - verance - is poised to again blow audiences away, and possibly, once more rake in billions. The film, which opens in theaters today, might be Cameron's most ambitious undertaking yet - which is saying something for the 68-year-old filmmaker of \"Titanic,\" \"The Terminator\" and \"Aliens.\" \"I don't want to do any - thing but big swings,\" Cam - eron says. We've been here before. After cost overruns and de - lays, \"Titanic\" was written off as a sure-to-bomb case study of Hollywood excess. Then it made $2.2 billion in ticket sales and won 11 Oscars. Not everyone was pre-sold on \"Avatar,\" either, which resuscitated 3-D af - ter decades of dormancy. \"There was a guarded skepticism around this film,\" he adds, \"as there should always be with any new film.\" \"The Way of Water,\" which Cameron scripted with Rick Jaffa and Aman - da Silver, takes place a decade after the events of the first \"Avatar.\" Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the paralyzed Marine who donned an avatar on Pando - ra, is now fully enmeshed in the remote world of the Na'vi. He and Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) have three teen - age children. When human soldiers come hunting for him, Jake moves his family to a reef clan of Na'vi who live harmoniously with the ocean. The trials the family en - dures turn surprisingly wrenching in what's al - ready been called Camer - on's most emotional film. That may be partly because much of Cameron's own ex - perience as a father raising five children in New Zea - land is woven into the film, as is his early life growing up in Ontario as the eldest son of an electrical engineer father. \"I remember what that was like for me. I've been Lo-ak,\" says Cameron, re - ferring to Jake and Neytiri's middle son. \"The Way of Water,\" which is being shown in 3-D and 48-frames-per- second, also means a new generation of technological advancement. While it's un - likely to be as much a mile - stone as the first was visu - ally, the blend of CGI and live action, above ground and under water, makes for an even more strikingly de - tailed vistas. \"We're able to deliver a much greater ability of pho - torealism than we ever did before,\" says producer Jon Landau. \"When we made the first movie, I would say to people, 'We need it to be photographic.' Now in this movie, we have so many Avatar, Na'vi characters in the live-action world and we have so many live-action characters in the Pandora world, we need to be photo - real. That's a new standard we have to live up to.\" That's most beautifully rendered in the film's wa -ters, where teeming sci - ence-fiction species of flora and fauna enrich an imag - ined ocean paradise. To Cameron, an avid deep-sea explorer whose passions for sea nearly outstrip his love of filmmaking, \"The Way of the Water\" is his grand ode to the ocean. \"It's also a cri de coeur to people around the world to protect and be guardians of the oceans, to be guardians of nature, in general. That's what these 'Avatar' movies are about,\" Cameron says. \"Maybe cinema's back. Maybe enough people out there do care about that dream of cinema.\" Vianney Le Caer / Invision / AP Director James Cameron poses for photographers upon arrival at the World premiere of the film 'Avatar: The Way of Water' in London on Dec. 6. REVIEW Yes! 'The Way of Water' is a big-screen blast By LINDSEY BAHR Associated Press It is impossible to talk about \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" without sound - ing hyperbolic. But James Cameron's sequel is a truly dazzling cinematic expe - rience that will have you floating on a blockbuster high. No matter if you've spent a second of your life in the past 13 years thinking about what's happening on Pandora or how Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) are getting on, assuming you remember their characters' names. \"The Way of Wa - ter\" will make awe-struck believers out of even \"Av - atar\" agonistics like me, at least for three hours and 12 minutes. The film isn't just visually compelling, either, it's spiritually rich as well - a simple but penetrating story about family and the natural world that is galax - ies better than the first. About that run time: Three hours and 12 min - utes sounds excessive, but there is something decid - edly decadent about really committing that much time to a movie in a theater. In other words, it's not a big ask. And you'll forget all about checking the time from the first shot of Pandora and Jake's earnest exposition about what's been going on in the past decade. He and Neytiri have three kids now, Neteyam (Jamie Flatters), Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss) and an adopted teen - age daughter, Kiri (Sigour - ney Weaver), and they're happy living in the forest. The humans are on the hunt for Jake, with a familiar antagonist leading the charge. And soon his family is on the run, taking up home in another part of Pandora, on the water with a new tribe led by Ronal (Kate Winslet) and To - nowari (Cliff Curtis) who reluctantly grant them ref - uge and try to teach them how to live on the water. It's worth noting Camer - on has not stuffed the film with mind-numbing, wall- to-wall action and needless - ly complicated plot. There are long stretches of movie where we're simply explor - ing the environment with the characters, delighting in the intricacies of a reef or basking in the beauty of giant sea creatures. It is not even really developing characters. It just is, and it's serene. The action is there, too, of course, and it's exciting because you've become invested in the family and worried about the kids who are never where they're supposed to be and are of - ten in danger because of it. And though we know there are more sequels coming, and one already wrapped, this is not the kind of franchise where anyone is guaranteed to get a fake superhero death. Sure there is some silliness, but there is something admirable about the straightforward dialogue and emotions at play, too. No one is snark - ing their way through this ordeal. \"Never doubt James Cameron\" has become a bit of a rallying cry lately. It's all the more extraordinary as the once-mythical se - quels had become a kind of joke in the years since the first movie. Even as \"The Way of Water\" release date actually approached the \"who cares?\" chorus inten - sified. But Cameron knows his way around a thrilling sequel, and the water for that matter (and references his own greatest hits in this film, too). But then people saw it and the tune changed. There is something com - forting about the fact that we are capable of intense, collective cultural whip - lash. That \"who cares?\" can turn to uncynical amazement in an instant. Is that the magic of the movies? Of continuing to push the bounds of the big screen experience? Of betting big on weird-sound -ing stories about giant blue environmentalists instead of superheroes every so often? Maybe it's just the magic of James Cameron. 20th Century Studios via AP Jake Sully, portrayed by Sam Worthington, in \"Avatar: The Way of Water.\"Avatar: The Way of Water The film is a 20th Cen - tury Studios release in theaters today and is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Associa - tion.

A6 Thursday, December 15, 2022 Paragould Daily Press MGM / Library of Congress via AP This image shows Meg Ryan, left, and Billy Crystal in a scene from \"When Harry Met Sally.\" 'When Harry Met Sally,' 'Iron Man' added to film registry By JOCELYN NOVECK AP National Writer They'll have what she's having. The 1989 rom-com \"When Harry Met Sally\" is one of 25 films chosen this year to enter the Na - tional Film Registry, a list that ranges from Disney's \"The Little Mermaid\" to an 1898 silent documen - tary, long thought lost, about the Mardi Gras pa - rade in New Orleans. Also chosen this year for preservation: Marvel's \"Iron Man,\" John Waters' \"Hairspray,\" \"Carrie\" and the 1950 \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" star - ring Jose Ferrer, whose performance made him the first Hispanic actor to win a best actor Oscar. The registry is housed at the Library of Congress, which since 1988 has se - lected movies for preserva - tion based on their cultural and historic importance. This year's picks bring the total number of films in the registry to 850 - many of which are among the 1.7 million films in the li - brary's collections. The oldest film select - ed this year is the 1898 \"Mardi Gras Carnival,\" a silent-era documentary with the earliest known footage of the carnival in New Orleans. A copy was recently found at the Eye Filmmuseum in the Neth - erlands. Showing floats, spectators and marchers at a parade, the film is one of nine documen - taries chosen, covering topics like the Attica prison rebellion, female union workers, mental health treatment, LGBTQ history and others. And the most recent film on this year's list is the 2011 \"Pariah,\" by Dee Rees, a coming-out story about a lesbian teen in Brooklyn that's consid - ered a prominent film in modern queer cinema. Among the films enter - ing the registry: \"Iron Man\" (2008), the Marvel superhero film starring Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow, directed by Jon Favreau. \"Carrie\" (1976), the Brian de Palma horror classic about a teen out - cast (Sissy Spacek) with telekinetic powers. \"Hairspray\" (1988), the John Waters version of the story about teen - agers in Baltimore, star - ring Ricki Lake, Debbie Harry, Jerry Stiller, Son - ny Bono and Divine. The film would go on to be - come a successful Broad - way musical. \"Charade\" (1963) by Stanley Donen, the only movie to pair Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. \"Cyrano de Berger - ac\" (1950) directed by Michael Gordon, the first U.S. film version of Ro - stand's 1897 French play. Ferrer won the best actor Oscar. The library said that Turner Classic Movies would host a TV special on Dec. 27, screening a se - lection of this year's mov - ies entering the registry.AP names Breakthrough Entertainers By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS They worked hard, with the rewards coming slowly but surely. Then something came along - often a key role or sometimes a cluster, maybe an album - and it all became next-level, a shift triggering where-did-you- come-from vibes. That describes most of this year's nine Associat - ed Press' Breakthrough Entertainers of the Year, a class of talent that flow - ered in 2022. They are Sa - die Sink, Stephanie Hsu, Tenoch Joaquina Kalukango, Danielle Deadwyler. Sink had been on Broad - way and worked along - side stars such as Naomi Watts and Helen Mirren. But playing Max May - field in the fourth season of \"Stranger Things,\" she broke through as a brave skater girl who never lets go of her Walkman, who hates pink, plays video games and is a \"Dragon's Lair\" champion. Hsu also was a Broad - way veteran with a few TV credits when she was asked to play both a sullen teen and an intergalactic supervillain in the movie \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" That led to an unforgettable performance that included dressing as Elvis and walking a pig on a leash. Like many of the others on the list, Kalukango had racked up plenty of Broad - way credits when she took a risk and played the lead in a Broadway musical, \"Paradise Square.\" It led to a best actress in a lead - ing role Tony Award and a stunning moment in the telecast when she sang \"Let It Burn.\" \"Black Panther: Wakan - da Forever\" isn't one of Huerta's biggest roles but the Mexican actor sud - denly launched a hundred memes as the mutant lead - er of a kingdom based on Mayan and Aztec influenc - es beneath the ocean for centuries. Huerta, known for roles in the Netflix se - ries \"Narcos: Mexico\" and the movie \"The Forever Purge,\" has taken a big step for movie diversity. Nwigwe, just nominated for a Grammy as best new artist, has been bubbling up with noted appearances on NPR's Tiny Desk Con - cert series and earning a spot on Michelle Obama's 2020 workout playlist with \"I'm Dope.\" This year, the artist was featured on the \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" soundtrack and dropped the EP \"moMINTs\" to ac - claim. McCormack has worked consistently since 2018 but 2022 seems to have turned into something spe - cial with a constellation of roles - \"Peaky Blinders,\" the buzzy, dark comedy thriller \"Bad Sisters,\" plus a star-making performance as the title character in the film \"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande\" opposite Emma Thompson. Ashley, a British actress of Indian heritage with a Tamil background, found herself leading season two of the Regency-era period drama \"Bridgerton.\" She had a role in the series \"Sex Education,\" but playing the fiercely independent Kate Sharma for Shonda Rhimes was her first lead character in a major production. Deadwyler burst into the awards race this year with her performance in \"Till\" as Mamie Till-Mobley, the mother of teenager Em - mett Till, who was lynched in 1955. She has also ap - peared in \"The Harder They Come,\" \"Watchmen\" Eleven.\" Vellani, another member of the Marvel Cinemat - ic Universe on this list, is the exception, having had no such slow burn. The 19-year-old actor in \"Ms. Marvel\" plays a high school student enamored with all things superheroes only to find herself sudden - ly wielding powers of her own. And Vellani, in real life, is just starting to find her powers, like all the en - tertainers nominated here.

God of War, Wordle lead a bumpy year for video games By LOU KESTEN Associated Press It's been a bumpy year for video games, in part thanks to the ongoing re - percussions of the pandem - ic. Some major releases got delayed (2023 could be a doozy), but enough crossed the finish line to keep gamers happy. Indie developers held up their end, delivering innovative challenges and fascinating stories. Here are the games we enjoyed the most in 2022: 1. God of War: Rag - nar\u00f6k: The latest chapter in the saga of surly Spartan warrior Kratos delivers ev - erything you could ask for in a AAA Sony PlaySta - tion blockbuster. There's bone-crushing combat against awe-inspiring mythical monsters. There are clever environmental puzzles to solve when you need a break from the may - hem. There's a surprisingly moving story about father - hood, regret and the battle between fate and free will. 2. Wordle: On the other end of the spectrum is this simple yet seductive word and logic game that you can play in a few minutes while you're eating break - fast. Created by software engineer Josh Wardle for his partner's amusement, Wordle became a phenom - enon when he added the ability for players to share their successes (and fail - ures) on social media. 3. Horizon: Forbidden West: Sony's other big re - lease of 2022 is this sprawl - ing postapocalyptic adven - ture. 2017's \"Horizon: Zero - oine Aloy discovered why civilization collapsed; now she has to stop a mysteri - ous enemy from wiping out humanity for good. 4. Pentiment: It's not often that you see a vid - eo game in which a major plot point revolves around Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. But such is life in 16th cen - tury Germany, the setting of this thought-provoking whodunit told with beauti - ful graphics that evoke the manuscripts and woodcuts of the medieval era. 5. Norco: A young wom - an named Kay returns to her Louisiana hometown after her mother's death in this absorbing mystery. Norco - an actual town, built around a giant oil refinery - is a desolate place, damaged by flooding and decades of pollution, but it takes on an odd kind of beauty thanks to vivid pixel art reminis - cent of classic LucasArts games of the 1990s. t's one of the most thoughtfully written games in years. 6. Return to Monkey Island: Speaking of Lu - casArts, one of the mad geniuses of its golden age, Ron Gilbert, came back this year with an uproari - ous reprise of his most fa - mous creation. Stumbling wannabe swashbuckler Guybrush Threepwood is determined to finally learn the Secret of Monkey Is - land that was promised in the 1990 original. (Spoiler: It's very silly.) 7. Elden Ring: Japan's From Software studio's move from gloomy, claus - trophobic castles into a more colorful, inviting open world at least gives less masoch - istic players a chance to explore its singular take on sword-and-sorcery. 8. The Case of the Gold - en Idol: The tiny studio Color Gray Games (essen - tially two Latvian brothers) made a splash with this in - genious mystery linking 12 gruesome crimes into one big conspiracy. Each case gives you a series of most - ly static screenshots, and your job is to figure out not just whodunit, but what the heck happened in the first place. It'll make you feel like Columbo - albeit in the 18th century - as you piece together bits of evi - dence to assemble a coher - ent narrative. 9. Marvel Snap: Each player has a handful of Marvel characters that are played onto three loca - tions that have different effects; the goal is to take over two of the three spots. One game takes just a few minutes, but it's easy to lose hours playing just one more as you try to assem - ble a killer deck. 10. Kirby and the For - gotten Land: Nintendo's best Switch game this year finally takes Kirby into a 3D world, opening up some new skills and chal - lenges for the adorable pink blob. Kirby can inhale enemies and take on their powers.Forgotten Land is easy, but it's fun to play co- op with younger kids, and there are enough hidden secrets that you'll want to replay each level after the kids have gone to bed. Minister Liz Truss quit Thursday after a tumul-tuous and historically brief term marred by economic policies that roiled financial markets and a rebellion in her political party that oblit-erated her authority. After just 45 days in office, Truss became the third Conservative prime minister to be toppled in as many years, and she will go down as the shortest-serving leader in British history. Her resig-nation extends the instabil-ity that has shaken Britain since it broke off from the European Union and leaves its leadership in limbo as the country faces a cost-of-living crisis and looming recession. \"I cannot deliver the man- date on which I was elected by the Conservative Party,\" Truss, 47, said outside her 10 Downing Street office. Financial markets breathed a sigh of relief, but now a divided ruling party must quickly find a leader who can unify its warring factions. Truss said she will remain in office until a replacement is chosen, which the Conservative Party said it would do by the end of next week, an extremely fast timeline for choosing the next leader of one of the world's largest economies. Potential contenders include: former Treasury chief Rishi Sunak, who lost to Truss in the last leadership contest; House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt; Defense Secretary Ben Wallace; and Boris Johnson, the former prime minister ousted in July over a series of ethics scandals. The low-tax, low-regulation economic policies that got Truss elected by her party proved disastrous in the real world at a time of soaring inflation and weak growth. Her Sept. 23 economic plan included a raft of tax cuts that investors worried Britain couldn't afford. It pummeled the value of the pound and drove up the cost of mortgages, causing economic pain for people and businesses already strug - gling from an economy yet to emerge from the pain of the pandemic. That financial tumult led to the replacement of Truss' Treasury chief, multiple poli-cy U-turns and a breakdown of discipline in the governing Conservative Party. Truss resigned just a day after vowing to stay in power, saying she was \"a fighter and not a quitter.\" But she couldn't hold on any longer after a senior minister quit her government amid a bar-rage of criticism and a vote in the House of Commons Wednesday descended into chaos and acrimony. \"It's time for the prime minister to go,\" Conservative lawmaker Miriam Cates said, echoing the sentiments of many others. Before Truss, the shortest- serving prime minister in Britain had been George Canning, who died in office in 1827 after 119 days. The pound rose about 1% Thursday to around $1.13 after Truss' resignation. Where the Conservative Party goes from here is not clear. Its myriad factions \u2014 from hard-right Brexiteers to centrist \"One Nation\" Tories \u2014 are at each other's throats. \"Nobody has a route plan. It's all sort of hand-to-hand fighting on a day-to-day basis,\" Conservative law-maker Simon Hoare told the BBC on Thursday before Truss resigned. Newspapers that usually support the Conservatives were vitriolic. An editorial in the Daily Mail on Thursday was headlined: \"The wheels have come off the Tory clown car.\" Truss' departure on Thursday sparked jubila- tion for the tabloid Daily Star, which had set up a livestream last week featur-ing a photo of the prime minister beside a head of let-tuce to see which would last longer. \"This lettuce outlasted Liz Truss!\" it proclaimed Thursday. While many Britons joined the world in laughing at the lettuce joke, Bronwyn Maddox, director of inter-national affairs think-tank Chatham House, said \"there is no question that the U.K.'s standing in the world has been severely battered by this episode and by the revolving door of prime min-isters.\" She said Truss' successor would need to have policies \"based on economic stability, but need also to include a resolution of the relationship with Europe; much of the upheaval represents the bit-ter aftermath of Brexit.\" The Conservative Party said nominations for a new leader will close on Monday. Candidates need the sig-natures of 100 of the 357 Conservative lawmakers, meaning a maximum field of three. Lawmakers will knock out one of those, and will ask the party's 172,000 members to decide between the two finalists in an online vote. The new leader is due to be in place by Oct. 28. Truss' resignation is the culmination of months of simmering discontent inside the Conservative Party, whose poll ratings have plunged. Johnson's government came undone after he was revealed to have held a series of parties in govern-ment buildings at a time when people in Britain were barred from mingling with friends and family or even visiting dying relatives. The Conservative Party spent the summer picking a replace-ment as the economy wors-ened amid spiking energy prices triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Truss had served as Johnson's for-eign secretary. Whoever succeeds Truss will become the country's third prime minister this year. A national election doesn't have to be called until 2024, but opposition par - ties demanded one be held now, saying the government lacks democratic legitimacy. Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of presid-ing over \"utter chaos.\" \"This is doing huge dam- age to our economy and the reputation of our country,\" he said. \"We must have a chance at a fresh start. We need a general election - now.\" Truss' political unravel- ing began after she and her Treasury chief, Kwasi Kwarteng, unveiled an economic plan with 45 bil-lion pounds ($50 billion) in unfunded tax cuts. The notion of massive bor-rowing to finance tax cuts hammered the value of the pound and caused interest rates on U.K. government bonds to rise. The Bank of England was forced to inter-vene to prevent the crisis from spreading to the wider economy and putting pension funds at risk. Truss soon fired Kwarteng, and his replace-ment, Jeremy Hunt, scrapped almost all of Truss' tax cuts, cut short her energy subsidies and abandoned her promise of no public spending cuts. He said the government will need to save billions of pounds and that there are \"many difficult deci - sions\" to be made before he sets out a medium-term fiscal plan on Oct. 31. Speaking to lawmakers on Wednesday for the first time since the U-turn, Truss apolo - gized and admitted she had made mistakes, but insisted she would not resign. Within hours, a senior Cabinet minister, Home Secretary Suella Braverman, quit, blast-ing Truss in her resignation letter, saying she had \"con-cerns about the direction of this government.\" For many Conservative lawmakers, the final straw was a Wednesday evening vote over fracking for shale gas that produced chaotic scenes in Parliament, with party whips accused of using heavy-handed tactics to gain votes. Chris Bryant, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, said he \"saw members being physically manhan-dled ... and being bullied.\" Conservative officials denied this.8 The Saline Courier Friday, October 21, 2022 19863 I-30, Suite 5, Benton, Arkansas 501-315-7728Shutters Blinds Shades Free Estimates America's Newspapers is a national association supporting journalism and healthy newspapers in our local communities.

The Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs dug in its heels in an Oct. 18 letter to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, saying \"the containers will remain in place until specific details regarding construc-tion are provided.\" It was signed by Allen Clark, the department's director. A regional spokes- woman for the Bureau of Reclamation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Arizona's refusal in the most recent flap between the Biden administration and Republican-led border states over immigration policies. The federal agency told Arizona officials in a letter last week that the containers were unauthorized and vio - lated U.S. law. The bureau also demanded that no new containers be placed, saying it wanted to prevent con-flicts with two federal con-tracts already awarded and two more still pending to fill border wall gaps near the Morelos Dam in the Yuma, Arizona, area. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey ordered installation of more than 100 double-stacked containers that were placed over the summer, saying he couldn't wait for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to award the con-tracts it had announced for the work. Migrants have continued to avoid the recently erected barriers by going around them, including through the Cocopah Indian Reservation.Associated Pressswtimes.com | THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2022 | 5A Aries (March 21-April 19).

Difficulty level ranges from Bronze (easiest) to Silver to Gold (hardest) RATING: BRONZE YESTERDAY'S ANSWERSUDOKU | CREATORSEarly in the Spingold Teams at the Summer NABC, Nick Nickell's top-seed-ed team was upset by a squad from Aus- tralia/New Zealand. The match was close when today's deal arose. At one table NICKELL 's East-West played at four hearts, down two, minus 200. In the replay, on the auction shown, the second-round double by North forNICKELL was responsive; most playerswould have bid two spades. WhenSouth competed to three spades,North's normal action was a pass; but hebroke discipline and went on to game. SINGLETON The defense took two hearts, and East led his stiff club. Declarer avoided acalamity when he took the ace, but hewas down one, minus 100. I can't be too critical of the four- spade bid: If the opening bidder hadheld the king of clubs, game would havemade. Still, if NICKELL is plus 140 at thesecond table and minus 100 at the first(where declarer could have saved atrick), they would have won an IMP in-stead of losing seven. And the finalscore was 104 to 97. DAILY QUESTION You hold: K J 3 2 8 6 K 8 A Q 8 5 2. Your partner opens one diamond.The next player passes. What do yousay? ANSWER: Respond two clubs. Were your hand weaker and worth only oneforward-going bid, you would use it tolook for a fit in the major: You would re-spond one spade. As it is, you haveenough to commit to game, so you canbid naturally: long suit first. If partnerrebids two diamonds, bid two spadesnext.

It was also trash day, so the storm picked up and scattered garbage all over, he said. Icy weather from the hug e storm was expected to affect the U.S. from coast to coast. It began by dumping heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada and was predicted to bring ice and snow to the Eastern U.S. in the coming days. \"This system is notable for the fact that it's going im- pact areas all the way from California to eventually the Northeast,\" said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist withthe National Weather Service in College Park, Mary- land. A widespread cold air outbreak was predicted to fol- low later this week, he said. \"Pretty much every area east of the Rockies will see below normal to well below normal temperatures,\" hesaid. Blizzard warnings stretched from Montana into western Nebraska and Colorado, and the National Weather Service said as much as 2 feet of snow was possible in some areas of western South Dakota and northwestern Nebraska. Winds of more than 50 mph at times would make it impossible to see outdoors in Ne- braska, officials said. \"There's essentially no one traveling right now,\" Jus- tin McCallum, a manager at the Flying J truck stop at Ogallala, Nebraska, said Tuesday. Roads were covered with ice and snow across North Dakota, where authorities Tuesday evening closed In-terstate 94 between Bismarck and Fargo because it be- came impassable, the Bismar ck Tribune reported. Forecasters expect the storm system to hobble theupper Midwest with ice, rain and snow for days, as well as move into the No rtheast and central Appalachians. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm watch from Wednesday night through Friday after-noon, depending on the timing of the storm. Residents from West Virginia to Vermont were told to watch for apossible significant mix of snow, ice and sleet. The winter blast shut down all roads in the north- east quadrant of Colorado. Jim Santomaso of the Colo- rado Cattlemen's Association said he was concernedthat extreme winds could push livestock through fences and keep them w andering in the gale's direc- tion. Santomaso, \"cattle drift miles.\" A blizzard warning was issued on Minnesota's north shore as some areas were expecting up to 2 feet of snow and wind gusts up to 40 mph. And in the south of the state, winds gusting up to 50 mph had reduced visibil- ity. National Weather Service meteorologist Melissa Dye in the Twin Cities said this is a \"long duration event\" with snow, ice and rain through Friday night. Minnesota was expecting a lull Wednesday, followedby a second round of snow.Conditions Continued from Page 1AMore than 155,000 Americans who shared their DNA for science are aboutto learn something in return: Do theyhave some particularly worrisomegenes? It's part of a massive project to unrav- el how people's genetics, environmentsand habits interact to determine theiroverall health. The National Institutesof Health said Tuesday it's now startingto notify participants about some earlyfindings - if they carry variants that cancause any of 59 inherited diseases ortrigger medication problems. Because everyone with the same gene won't have the same health out-come, sharing those results may spur new discoveries. \"What are the drivers in that variabil- ity?\" asked Dr. study. their behaviors in responseto the findings, we'll be able to look atthat.\"All of Us is an unprecedented effort to reduce health disparities and end to- day's one-size-fits-all care. Researchers aim to track 1 million people from allwalks of life for at least a decade to bet-ter understand the complex combina-tions of factors that determine why onesibling gets sick and not another, or why a cure for one patient fails in another. Volunteers share DNA samples, med- ical records, fitness tracking and answerhealth questions. About 560,000 haveenrolled so far - importantly, nearly halffrom racial and ethnic groups historical-ly left out of medical research. Traditionally such studies are a one- way street - scientists learn a lot fromvolunteers who get little personal infor-mation in return. But in an unusualmove, All of Us participants get to de-cide if they want to learn health-relatedgenetic findings, long before the study'sfinished. \"I kind of shudder to think about what could happen if I hadn't knownthis,\" said Rachele Peterson, an NIH em-ployee participating in the study.An All of Us genetic counselor broke the news to the Philadelphia woman that she was at increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer because of a genenamed BRCA-2. Peterson, who volunteered for All of Us before recently becoming the pro-ject's chief of staff, didn't realize that was a risk for her family. The knowledge \"allows you to take charge,\" said Peterson, who plans to dis-cuss options with her own doctor suchas increased breast cancer screening orwhether to consider precautionary ova-ry removal. Denny estimated 2% to 3% of study participants will learn they have a well-known genetic variant that can causecertain cancers, heart conditions or oth-er disorders. Many more will have ge-netic variants that affect how their bodyprocesses certain medicines. For now, participants only will be giv- en findings they can do somethingabout, such as seeking earlier diagnosisor switching medications. They'll be of-fered free confirmatory testing, geneticcounseling, and help with sharing the information with their physicians and family members. But there's a lot more to learn. For ex- ample, the vast majority of disease-linked genes were discovered by study-ing people of European ancestry. Verydifferent variants may play a bigger role for other ancestries, said Baylor Collegeof Medicine genetics expert Eric Venner. His team is using the diverse All of Us genetic database to start teasing apartwhich differences matter most to whichpopulations. If new findings affect study volun- teers, \"we're going to keep things up todate,\" Denny said. \"That's the power of being able to talk to our participants,partnering with them for potentiallydecades.\" The Associated Press Health and Sci- ence Department receives support fromthe Howard Hughes Medical Institute'sScience and Educational Media Group.The AP is solely responsible for all con-tent.

POLICE LOGSHERIFF 'S LOGNEWS IN BRIEF Benton woman, HS man arrested on drug charges STEVEN MROSS The Sentinel-Record A Benton woman and Hot Springs man were arrested on felony drug charges Monday after a traffic stop on their vehi-cle, which the woman reported-ly claimed they were only test driving. Deena Kay Duncan, 36, of Benton, and Jarrod Brandon Vice, 42, who lists a Cooper Street address, were taken into custody around 12:15 p.m. and each charged with possession of a controlled substance, meth, and possession of drug para-phernalia, each punishable by up to six years in prison. Duncan, who was also cit- ed for driving on a suspended driver's license, fictitious tags and no liability insurance, was later released on a $5,000 bond and is set to appear on Oct. 31 in Garland County District Court. Vice remained in custody on a $5,000 bond and was set to ap-pear Wednesday in district court. Duncan was previously arrested on July 8 on felony charges of possession of meth with purpose to deliver, posses-sion of cocaine with purpose to deliver and two counts of pos-session of drug paraphernalia. She was released on a $22,000 bond on Aug. 22 and is set for an omnibus hearing in Garland County Circuit Court on Nov. 1. According to the probable cause affidavit, Garland County sheriff's Deputy Thomas Fox made a traffic stop on a green Mazda 626 at Crystal Hill and Blacksnake roads after a com-puter check showed the license returned to a Ford Mustang. He made contact with the driver, identified as Duncan, who stated she and her passenger, identified as Vice, were \"test driv-ing the vehicle to see if they were going to purchase it.\" A computer check showed Duncan's driver's license was suspended and she had a failure to appear warrant out of Saline County so Fox had her exit the car. Fox noted Duncan \"appeared very nervous\" and was \"physi-cally shaking\" as she exited the car. He noted several items in the back seat of the car includ-ing a purple luggage case. Fox asked why, if they were only test driving the vehicle, they had so many items in the back including luggage. Duncan claimed all the items were al-ready in the vehicle when they began driving it and she didn't know if there was anything ille-gal in the vehicle. Deputy Jeremy Navra arrived to assist and spoke to Vice, who stated he and Duncan had been \"spending time together for a couple of days\" and the trash and items in the floor belonged to him, but the purple suitcase and purse belonged to Duncan. It was noted Vice also had a sus-pended driver's license. Duncan reportedly gave Fox consent to search the suitcase and he allegedly located a toilet-ry bag that contained three bags of unused syringes, one used syringe and one loaded syringe with 39 CCs of what later tested positive for meth. There were also several items of women's clothing and makeup. Both Dun-can and Vice denied ownership of the suitcase. In searching Vice for weap- ons or contraband, deputies allegedly located a loaded sy-ringe with 20 CCs of what Vice admitted was \"meth\" and it lat-er tested positive. After being taken into custody, Vice also reportedly admitted there was a digital scale in the glove box which Fox located. Deputies also found several noncontrolled substance pills in a bottle and a baggie with white powder residue.

In the summer, the Future Fund grant cycle opens, for which Future Fund members select a focus area of needs to be considered for the grant, the foundation's website says. Grants for this cycle range between $500 and $2,500. Finally, in the fall, the Giving Tree grant cycle opens in July, offering grants ranging between $500 and $10,000. \"But we have one little reception to recognize all of them,\" Whitfield said of the 31st Giving Tree Grant Awards Reception held earlier this month. The HSACF awarded a total of $229,608 throughout 2022. \" A part of our mission is to make grants to meet the needs in the community, as far as finding where we can put our dollars to make the most impact,\" Whitfield said. The grants are funded through the foundation's endowment fund's accrued interest throughout the year, she said. \"We have a lot of donors,\" she said. \"We just had several that stepped up and just had some interest in helping out some of these causes.\" Grant applications are reviewed by a grant review committee made up of grant committee board members, and selections are made based on community needs, she said. \"We're meeting some of these needs that otherwise possibly would not be funded. They're important because it provides the nonprofits in our area ways to grow their missions and provide for their causes that each one of them work so hard to provide in our community.\" To learn more about how to apply for grant cycles through the HSACF, visit www.arcf.org/affiliates/hot-springs-area.

Kasey G. Robinson, 41, who lists an Orange Street address, was taken into custody around 3 p.m. while appearing in Gar-land County Circuit Court, 501 Ouachita Ave., on an unrelat-ed matter and served with the warrants for two counts of pos- session of a firearm by certain persons, punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Robinson was later re- leased on a $5,000 bond and is set to appear on the charges on Dec. 22 in Gar- land County District Court. According to court records, Robinson was arrested on April 12 on three counts of de- livery of meth and released on a $100,000 bond on July 25. He was appearing on one of the counts Wednesday when he was arrested. Robinson was previously convicted in Garland County in 2004 of drug charges and possession of a firearm by cer- tain persons and sentenced to six years in prison. He was con-victed again on drug charges in Pulaski County in 2009 and sentenced to five years in pris- on, all suspended. He was con- victed again in 2014 in Faulkner County of second-degree do-mestic battery and aggravated assault on a family or house- hold member and sentenced to four years in prison. According to the proba- ble cause affidavit on the new charges, on Oct. 9, shortly be-fore 4:30 a.m., HSPD Cpl. Jjesus Anaya responded to a residence in the 100 block of Holt Street regarding an overdose death. Anaya found the female vic- tim on the floor of the back bedroom which was shared by the victim and Robinson, who stated the female was his wife and confirmed they were stay- ing in that room. During a search of the room for evidence that caused the victim's death, Anaya allegedly located two firearms, a Glock 43 9-mm pistol and a Taurus G2C pistol. A computer check revealed Robinson's previous felony con-victions and a warrant for his arrest on the gun charges was issued on Nov. 10. ROBINSON Man arrested on drug charges after traffic stop STEVEN MROSS The Sentinel-Record A reportedly homeless man sought on misdemeanor failure to appear warrants was arrested on felony drug charges after a traffic stop late Wednesday. Justin Alan Gerarden, 28, who lists \"city streets\" as his address, was taken into custody shortly before 10:30 p.m. and charged with felony counts of possession of a controlled sub-stance, meth, and possession of drug paraphernalia, each punishable by up to six years in prison, and a misdemeanor count of driving on a suspended driver's license in addition to the two warrants. He remained in custody Thursday in lieu of a $6,500 bond and is set to appear Monday in Garland County District Court. According to court records, Gerarden was previously con-victed in 2018 of theft by re-ceiving over $5,000, involving a stolen truck, felony fleeing and driving while intoxicated, third offense, and sentenced to three years' supervised probation. He was convicted on Nov. 12, 2019, of DWI, fourth offense, a felony, and sentenced to five years in prison, but later paroled.According to the proba-ble cause affi-davit, around 10:15 p.m. Wednesday, Hot Springs po-lice saw a black 2005 Chevro-let truck turn-ing onto Pakis Street from Central Avenue. After checking his computer, Officer William Stockwell not-ed the registered owner of the vehicle, identified as Gerarden, had warrants for his arrest. He made a traffic stop on the truck in the 400 block of Cor- nerstone Boulevard and made contact with the driver, identified as Gerarden, and confirmed the warrants and discovered his driv-er's license was also suspended so he was taken into custody. In conducting an inventory of the vehicle, officers allegedly found a black case on the dash which contained a broken glass meth pipe with residue. They found another case in the stor-age compartment under the ra-dio which reportedly contained a bag with less than one gram of what later tested positive for meth and a straw with residue.GERARDEN that information is made public, I don't think we're going to be able to bring anybody to the table.\" The board unanimously ad- opted Garcia's amendment to the resolution authorizing the contract, agreeing to include \"copies of all offers to purchase shall be shared with the board of directors as received\" in the contract. \"I don't have any problem sharing that,\" Dews said. \"I think the difficulty we're going to have with developers is if all of their information is made pub-lic. That's the concern we have.\" HSMP President/CEO Gary Troutman said he would be re-luctant to disclose who has sub-mitted redevelopment proposals until the close of the 10-month vetting period. \"I don't know if we'd feel com- fortable naming them depending on where we are in the process,\" he told the board. \"We don't want to scare anyone off who could be a viable project for us.\" Most of the work HSMP does for the city is shared with the board in broad terms, as nondisclosure agreements pre-vent HSMP from revealing spe-cifics about the projects it's pur-suing. Troutman told the board the same level of nondisclosure in the monthly reports he makes is likely to apply to the market-ing of the Majestic. \"Everything that's not NDA is usually in there,\" he said of the reports required by HSMP's contract with the city. \"I would think this would kind of follow the same suit. ... We're going to be proactive in our recruitment, but I don't have a feel for how much attention we're going to get,\" he said. The board made the rede- velopment of the Majestic one of its top priorities in 2021 and 2022. After the city's attempt to solicit proposals in 2020 re-turned few responses, and the contract to build an outdoor entertainment venue on the site was terminated in July, City Manager Bill Burrough told di-rectors in August the city would be focused on other priorities next year. HSMP offered to market the site in September. Its involve-ment was conditioned on being the clearinghouse for all propos-als and offers. Dews said HSMP didn't want to be undermined by developers working outside its purview. \"We just don't want anybody to be able to circumvent the process,\" he told the board in September. \"If we go out and pursue developers and bring them to Hot Springs, if all it takes is somebody bringing a real estate contract to cut to the front of the line, that's the only thing we're concerned about.\"Majestic Continued from Page 1Aremains unnamed, was placed on administrative leave while an in-vestigation was being performed after a Jessieville student accused the employee of sexual assault.

The Sentinel-Record follows The Associated Press privacy policies and does not publish the names of juvenile offend-ers unless they are charged as adults. According to the probable cause affidavit, at around 6:20 p.m. Oct. 5, Hot Springs police responded to the 600 block of School Street, between South and Greenwood avenues, in ref-erence to a shooting that had just occurred. Officers found a 16-year-old male, whose name has not been released, with an apparent gun-shot wound to the upper torso. There were also numerous shell casings located in the middle of the roadway. The 16-year-old was trans- ported to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries. A second victim, identified as Young, arrived at a local hos-pital by personal vehicle suf-fering from multiple gunshot wounds to his right arm and face. Police had previously said his injuries were not life-threat-ening. A third female victim, 17, whose name has also not been released, was located at the Exxon, 1200 Central Ave., with multiple gunshot wounds to the lower abdomen and upper thighs. According to earlier reports, the female was located in a vehi- cle at the Exxon where officers were flagged down by the male driver who was en route to a hospital with the victim. Offi-cers provided emergency aid to the female until EMS personnel arrived and transported her to a local hospital. Young and the female were taken to different hospitals. While on scene at 1200 Central, police made contact with the driver, identified as Tyjon Roland Harris, 19, of Hot Springs, who was taken to the police department for ques-tioning. After being read his rights, Harris reportedly stated he was driving on School Street when he saw Young, whom he knows, and several other Black males he did not know. Harris said Young ap- proached the driver's door of his vehicle where he was sit-ting, pointed a gun at him and said, \"Run me your (expletive)!\", which is a slang term for \"give me your property.\" Harris said he grabbed the gun and he and Young began to struggle over it. At that point, another Black male started helping Young and Harris saw a third male with a second gun. He said he began to drive away and that is when shots were fired. The female was later inter- viewed at the hospital and re-portedly stated she was with her boyfriend, identified as Harris, that day and they had gone to meet up with Young, whom she has known for several years, to \"purchase something,\" but she didn't know what. She said when they arrived, three males, including Young, Conrad and a third male she knew, the 16-year-old, ap-proached the driver's door of Harris' vehicle. She said one of the males pointed a gun at Harris and said, \"Run me your (expletive)!\" She said she couldn't see which male had the gun, but saw Harris grab it and \"all the males appeared to struggle.\" She said during the struggle \"shots began to be fired\" and that is when she was hit by bullets. Later that same day, Har- ris was arrested on a charge of theft by receiving of a firearm, a felony punishable by up to six years in prison. He was re-leased the next day on a $20,000 bond and pleaded not guilty to the charge in Garland County District Court on Oct. 20. He is set for a felony review hearing to determine if the case will be bound over to circuit court on Dec. 6. According to court records, Harris lists no prior criminal history. Warrants for Young and Conrad on the various charges filed against them were ob-tained on Oct. 7. Young was tak-en into custody on Oct. 25 \"at a location in the county,\" and Conrad turned himself in at the police department on Nov. 8. Report Continued from Page 1AThree men convicted in 2014 downing of Malaysian passenger jet over Ukraine MIKE CORDER AND RAF CASERT The Associated Press SCHIPHOL, Netherlands \u2014 A Dutch court on Thursday convicted three men of murder for their role in shooting down a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet with a Russian surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard the aircraft as it flew over a separatist-controlled re-gion of eastern Ukraine in 2014. The convictions, along with the life sentences handed to the two Russians and a pro-Moscow Ukrainian who were tried in absentia, were seen as directing the blame for the jet's downing at the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin, even though the Kremlin has always denied any connection to it. The trial, held in a court- room near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport where Flight MH17 took off for Kuala Lum- pur, Malaysia, put the Kremlin's involvement in the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine at the heart of the case. Against the geopolitical upheaval caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year, the court held that Moscow in 2014 had overall control of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peo- ple's Republic, the separatist area where the missile was launched. Presiding Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said evidence present- ed by prosecutors in the trial \u2014 which lasted more than two years \u2014 proved that the Boe-ing 777 was brought down by a Buk missile fired by pro-Mos-cow Ukrainian fighters on July 17, 2014. The crash scattered wreck- age and bodies over farmland and fields of sunflowers. The 298 passengers and crew killed in the downing came from more than a dozen countries, although nearly 200 were Dutch citizens. As relatives of the victims blinked away tears, Steenhuis The Associated Press Judges and lawyers view the reconstructed wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 on May 26, 2021, at the Gilze-Rijen military Airbase, southern Netherlands. See JET on Page 4Aselor, said culture is everything, and mental health on the indi-vidual level plays a significant role in creating that. \"I really feel like Cutter is unique here because we are in kind of an area where we have low socioeconomic students,\" he said. \"But what I find is that the students that come to school \u2014 they want to learn. Like, they are here to learn, and even though they have some things going on at home, this is kind of their safe haven.\" When considering the four- day week, he said mental health was a factor. \"The hope was that it would have a very positive impact. Be-cause we felt like that one-day break would kind of give a re-prieve to really, you know, go into the academic environment and really hit it harder as they approached it,\" he said. \"So looking at this year, we've kind of had a chance to kind of reflect at the end of this semester, look at the data, look at the students, and I can tell you first of all, just from talking to students, being around them, I've noticed they are really hap-py. They genuinely want to be at school. They genuinely want to learn,\" Stage said. \"Honestly, it has been trans- formational, in my opinion, for our school. Having our students come here four days, and I know they're a little bit longer, but in all honesty, they don't mind the longer days because they get that one day where they can go home, they can enjoy their fam- ilies, and they can kind of reset and gear themselves towards school.\" Stage said he has seen an improvement in academics be-cause of the focus on students' foundational needs. \"What we're trying to do at Cutter is make sure we are pro-viding, like I said, a safe haven away from home, in that we are providing all of those needs so that when they approach their educational experience, they are ready to excel,\" he said. \" And we have a lot of stu- dents that really are excelling with this four-day.\" Anderson said feedback from the staff, students and commu-nity has been positive and more surveys will be done as the next school year approaches. Baber said the district is see- ing gains, noting students took the NWEA MAP Test at the beginning of the year. MAP, or Measures of Academic Progress, is an adaptive achievement and growth test used as a diagnostic. \"We will take that when we come back from Christmas break, and I believe that will show us the gains that we've made from all of the things that we're doing,\" she said. \"The interventions during the day, the additional time during the day, the interventions after school and on Mondays, all of the mental health focus that we have put into place this year ... I think we're going to see all of that reflected in our NWEA MAP scores when we take that assessment in January.\" For families who need child care on Mondays, the district offers Monday school. With a focus on academic learning, it also incorporates physical ed-ucation into the day. She said when the students, in grades 3-12, were recently surveyed on the four-day week, results were very positive. \"They love only going four days and having that extra day off because they can prepare for it, they can spend more time with their friends, they can go on weekend trips with their families, they can have that family time as well as they feel like they're still getting the same amount of education in a four-day week,\" she said. \"They have longer class pe- riods, so where teachers might have struggled at some points getting all the content in in a 45-minute period, now they have close to an hour. They have that little bit of extra time where they can spend more time. \"We did also survey our community and it was overall pretty much positive. Overall our parents are very positive about the four-day week. They feel like their students are get-ting the same amount of ed-ucation even though they're on campus one day less. So that was very positive for us,\" she said.The Sentinel-Record, Saturday, December 17, 2022 3A Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas DHS HAS RESPITE OPPORTUNITIES: Vouchers to pay for respite care -up to $1,200 a year!

I've heard some great essays that were read today and it's fan-tastic to get to come here and hear things like this, that we've actually got young peo-ple that are involved and are moving our community for-ward.\" Essay Continued from Page 1ARussia launches another major missile attack HANNA ARHIROVA, VASILISA STEPANENKO AND JAMEY KEATEN The Associated Press KYIV , Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine's capital came under one of the biggest attacks of the war on Friday as Russia's invading forces fired dozens of missiles across the country, triggering widespread power outages, Ukrainian officials said.

Our Division of Provider Services and Quality Assurance (DPSQA) has partnered with the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition to offer vital assistance for respite care . What is respite care? Full- time caregiving is an around -the-clock job. Caregivers are often managing caring for a loved one with work, other family responsibilities, their own health, home upkeep, and more. Some of your students' parents, or even members of your own staff, may be in this situation right now. Respite care is care designed to give live -in caregivers a short -term break. Whether this break involves hours or weeks, respite care can help caregivers attend appointments, run errands, work outside their home, or simply take some time to relax and recharge. We want caregivers to know that there is help, and that it's perfectly OK to ask for a break and care for themselves so they can continue to care for their loved ones. These respite services are not dependent upon Medicaid or financial eligibility .

The breakdown and recovery of the mind- body connection is now unders tood to have underlying responsibility with the development and rehabilitation of the chronic diseases and pain epidemics. The inclusion of pain neuroscience established the foundation for this trajectory; however, a comprehensive behavioral perspective requires an understanding of cognitive and emotional factors.

This course offers an embodied perspective delving into and through behavioral models that advance the application of being psychologically informed. Self -efficacy and individualized empowerment are highlighted t hrough practical constructs. The course is didactic and practical. The course offers a mindfulness lab for acceptance, interoceptive, and contemplative training. The training is a way to monitor and change reactions and default modes reflective of unproductive perspectives of stress, dysfunction, pain, and disability. Discussions expand on positive psychology including active coping, resilience, grit, and post traumatic growth.

Caring for elderly parents or loved ones can sometimes be a hard task. Knowing how to navigate the system and find resources, knowing what medications they are taking, day to day living, and transportation are only a few of the moving parts that are associated with caring for the elderly. But in the midst of all of the day - to-day and the financial management, there comes into play the caregivers that are hired to take care of the loved one. Thi s presentation will provide a guide for families, siblings or others that are caregivers and oversee the care of an elderly loved one or parent. Through all the moving parts, there comes into play the part about theft and abuse that a loved one might exper ience due to a caregiver. This presentation will provide some tips on how to safeguard against the fraud while also making sure you are taking care of yourself in the process. Caring for elderly parents or even setting up for the care to happen is not an easy task. It takes a team or if there are just two, it takes \"team work\" and dedication from both to do their part. If one lives out of town, there are still tasks that need to be taken care of. There are a lot of moving parts that have to be put into play. Use social media and your contacts to ask questions about what your needs are. You do not know until you ask.

We also welcome the use of technology , which the pandemic brought us, to still be able to provide the conference in a virt ual platform for those who would not otherwise be able to join the in -person event. This is the first hybrid event that the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition and the Arkansas Department of Human Services has hosted together. This year's conference hopes to provide attendees a meaningful and productive space to enhance their knowledge and understanding of respite and gain valuable caregiver resource information from leaders across the state in respite and caregiving. We are very fortunate to have Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and Arkansas DHS Secretary Mark White join us for Opening Comments. We know that sometimes a hard part about being a caregiver is the limited opportunity you may have to meet new people, share stories, and support each other. Thi s event will also provide a unique opportunity for family caregivers all across the state to participate, meet and network with other caregivers in not only their own county of residence, but in every county. Vendor tables will also be available at the eve nt for attendees to seek out additional information or possible services that best fit their needs. This year's agenda focuses on two key elements - informational access for caregivers on how to navigate services programs, including Medicaid and Medicare, and focusing in on caregiver self- care. We have eight (8) different breakout session topics for you to choose from on the afternoon of Day 1, ranging from self- care techniques, elder care or senior health information, future planning, and Medicaid, Medicare and Arkansas's PASSE (Provider- led Arkansas Shared Savings Entity) system . Day Two (2) brings topics relating to a new pilot project coordinated for respite assistance directed at the Alzheimer's and Dementia populations, as well as several panel discus sions of various topics. A panel of professional experts in Arkansas's long -term care field will provide information on what to expect if a long- term care facility is the best option for your loved one. Work in building caregiver supports within the commun ity will also be featured when a panel discusses workforce building of respite care workers and volunteers. And the final panel discussion of the day will include caregivers themselves, discussing their own stories and situations and the lessons they have learned along the way. Lunch will be provided on both event days so that attendees can eat and enjoy keynote speakers. On Day 1, you will hear from the daughter of famed Arkansas coach and athletic director Frank Broyles on her family's experiences dealing with multiple Alzheimer's diagnoses and their work in the field to help others learn and grow with the disease. Day 2 will be a special virtual presentation by the director of the national respite network and resource center known as ARCH. 8 Share your conference pictures and highlights with #ARLifespanRespite on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter @ARHumanServices We have worked extremely hard to secure amazing speakers for you who will engage you and motivate you with their stories and presentations. Similarly, the speakers are very excited to meet and interact with everyone. We have included their profiles later in the program for you to familiarize yourself! And, finally, what would a conference be without some door prizes and fun?! Door prizes will be announced throughout each day and all you have to do is register to attend the conference (either in person or virtually) for a chance to win. There will also be opportunities to earn participation points throughout the event, make your way to the top of the participation leaderboard and score a prize too! History of the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Program In 2013, the Arka nsas Department of Human Services (DHS) and other respite community providers and advocates across the state began meeting to form the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition (ALRC). A respite summit was held that same year, bringing together statewide stakeho lders interested in improving respite service and seeking out funding opportunities. DHS, in partnership with the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition, was awarded its first federal Lifespan Respite Grant in 2014 and then again in 2018 from the Department o f Health and Human Services' Administration for Community Living. Arkansas received additional supplemental funding in 2019 to enhance respite services.

Arkansas's PASSE Program currently serves over 55,000 Medicaid clients across the state. This session will provide a general overview of the PASSE Program. Caring for an Aging Loved One (Presented by FranSha' Anderson and Kathleen Pursell) God gives a special grace to those who humble themselves to serve the aging and the disabled. Caring for elderly parents or loved ones can sometimes be a hard task. Knowing how to navigate the system and find resources, knowing what medications they are taking, day to day living, and transportation are only a few of the moving parts that are associated with caring for the elderly. But in the midst of all t he day-to-day and the financial management, there comes into play the caregivers that are hired to take care of the loved one. This presentation will provide a guide for families, siblings , or others that are caregivers and oversee the care of an elderly loved one or parent. Through all the moving parts, there comes into play the part about theft and abuse that a loved one might experience due to a caregiver. This presentation will provide some tips on how to safeguard against fraud while also making sure y ou are taking care of yourself in the process. Caring for elderly parents or even setting up the care is not an easy task. It takes a team - or if there are just two, it takes \"teamwork\" and dedication from both to do their part. If one lives out of town, there are still tasks that need to be taken care of. There are a lot of moving parts that have to be put into play. Use social medial and your contacts to ask questions about what your needs are. You do not know until you ask. Some of the information that w ill be presented is based on personal experience of being a caregiver/POA for a parent. Getting Older: What It's Like and What You Can Do To Help (Presented by Dr. Rick Caracciolo and Marguerite Caracciolo) Whether you like it or not, you are going to get older. Getting old is a new experience; you have never been old before. As your loved one ages and even us , you don't know what to expect, how to help or what to do. This hands -on workshop through empathetic simulation and participation activities will help the participant to better understand declining vision, mobility, fine motor skills and hearing loss as you 24 Share your conference pictures and highlights with #ARLifespanRespite on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter @ARHumanServices age. Attendees will be provided the opportunity to gain an understanding of aging, learn about resources and to examine assistive technology device s that might be of assistance in those declining areas as we ate.

Since that time, caregiving responsibilities have increased in the state while respite supports have remained stagnant. The purpose of this study was to pr ovide Arkansas caregivers a platform to provide input and feedback into a caregiver's environment and their overall understanding of respite supports available to them, while collecting preliminary demographic and quantitative data to determine future acti vities and services to reduce caregiver stress and promote caregiver overall health.

While there is currently no state funding for this program, previous federal grant awards have allowed the Arkansas Department of Human Services (\"DHS\") to build a volu nteer -based coalition comprised of respite providers and advocacy groups statewide . Additionally , that same federal funding provide s voucher opportunities to caregivers, provide s Arkansans with volunteer respite training, and conduct s small -scale awareness /outreach events, including annual Lifespan Respite Awareness Days at Arkansas' s State Capitol. A Lifespan Respite webpage maintained by DHS provides information to the public. The program's vision is to enhance current grassroot, person -centered style activities directing service provisions, easing burdens in finding respite availability, and continuing to build collaborations and partnerships to strengthen our current respite status . Lifespan respite is also developing a sustainability framework to ensure long -term respite needs are met and supports for caregivers across Arkansas continue . One of the most vital talking points , when it comes to understanding respite needs and service gaps in the state of Arkansas , is the demographic and census data on care givers in the state. There are several reports and articles regarding caregiving and caregiver status on a national scale; however, Arkansas has never done a full independent state analysis. During 2017, the Arkansas Lifespan Respite Coalition did conduct a caregiver feedback survey. Th at survey contained five (5) basic questions to gauge whether the respondent was a caregiver and if the caregiver needed or had received a break/respite in the past. The survey was conducted online through SurveyMonkey, but n o documentation can be found on survey methodology or how a target population was identified. Feedback from the 2017 survey resulted in 574 respondents from 47 counties in Arkansas. Of those respondents, 76.56 % (n= 428) indicated they were caregivers . Of those 574 total respondents, 67.60 % (n=388) indicated they needed a break from caregiving. When respondents were asked if they had ever received a break, just 36.99% (n=209) indicated they had . When asked if they had ever received respite, just 23.34 % (n=134) indicated they had . Furthermore, on ly 40.77 % (n=234) knew what \"respite\" was. An enhanced feedback survey was created in 2018; however, no evidence or documentation has been found of its release. It is uncertain if data was ever collected beyond the 2017 basic survey. Additionally, a legislative study on the respite needs and service gaps in Arkansas was proposed during Arkansas State Legislative 92nd General Assembly Regular Session in 2019 but was never completed. DHS's Division of Provider Services and Quality Assurance (DPSQA) was award ed a five (5) year federal grant through the Administration for Community Living (ACL) beginning July 1, 202 1, through June 30, 2026, known as the Lifespan Respite Integrity and Sustainability Grant (#90LRLI0045). Within the award, DPSQA identified $40,000 in the first grant year (July 2021 - June 2022) which could be used to conduct a statewide independent study on caregiver statistics and data analysis; however, there was difficulty in procuring an independent contractor to take on such a task when key dat a elements needed to be determined. At that time, the program decided to begin the data analysis with a preliminary data collection to 1) determine where to provide intense focus of marketing and informational outreach, 2) determine geographically where to hold small scale focus groups, workshops, and volunteer respite trainings, and 3) update infographics and other educational material. Scheduled grant activities will also include follow -up data collection and analysis in y ear 5 of the grant (July 2025 -June 2026) on progress made through other grant activities. The following report is based on preliminary data and statistics taken from a 2022 online survey produced by DPSQA. Methodology The survey pool was selected from recipients with open cases in 21 Medicaid categories administered by the DHS . To reach as many participants as possible, a report was ru n from the DHS ARIES Eligibility System with a list of all potential respondents. An initial report of 300,251 individuals were then sorted for duplications and email availability. Based on the large quantity of email addresses available , DHS chose to use the survey services of SurveyMonkey to send the survey to potential respondents . This would provide quick access to data and eliminate the cost of postage , paper printing, and the need for hand tallying, which would increase the risk for human error. Survey questions were then developed to allow for responses of yes or no, multiple choice, or sliding scale so data could be exported easily into an Excel forma t. The online survey was opened to the targeted population on February 24, 2022, and closed on March 11, 2022; a period of 16 calendar days. The population was notified of the online survey via email notification sent from DHS's mass notification system, Salesforce. The email was successfully delivered to 61,070 of the 64,943 available and unduplicated email addresses: a delivery rate of 94%. Upon closure of the targeted survey on March 11, 2022, the email had been opened by 23,463 individuals: 38.42% of th ose successfully delivered. To qualify for the survey, respondents had to be 18 year or older and self- identify as someone who had provided unpaid care to someone . This unpaid care must involve helping the individual care for themselves, or caring for a child (minor, less than 18 years of age) due to a medical, behavioral, or other condition or disability ( beyond required normal care.) Of the 23,463 successfully delivered emails, 553 identified as caregivers; this report examines their responses. Study Lim itations It is important to consider the limitations in the data collected when navigating this report. The total respondents make up less than one percent (0.25% ) of Arkansas's total population census as defined in 2021 (3,025,891) and less than one perce nt (0.33% ) of Arkansans 18 years or older. A study conducted in 2005 by the National Alliance for Caregiving indicated that at least 1.3 million youth caregivers between the ages of 8 and 18 are providing care for an ill or disabled parents or other individual in the United States.1 The study conducted here did not consider any potential caregiver who may be under 18 years of age, in the State of Arkansas . Future data collection should allow respondents to enter exact numbers for ages to allow for analysis and comparison to national data sub -groups. Additionally, the survey pool was comprised of individuals who have applied through DHS for some service or assistance in the past; therefore, it does not account for respondents that h ave never interacted with DHS. 1 National Alliance for Caregiving. Young Caregivers in the U.S.: Report of Findings September 2005, 2005. https://www.caregiving.org/wp -content/uploads/2020/05/youngcaregivers.pdf Reading This Report All demographic information provided by respondents is based on caregiving activities that had taken place within the last 12 months from the date of response. The sample sizes (n) noted in each table or graphic represent the unweighted number of responses who answered the question. All reported results shown are weighted and rounded to the nearest whole number. Note that \"don't know\", \"n/a\" and \"prefer not to answer\" responses are not always represented in the charts and ta bles; therefore, some charts and tables will not total 100 percent. The results for multi- response questions may total more than 100 percent , as respondents were allowed to choose more than one category, if applicable . Data derived from this survey was co mpared to t hree national data reports: a 2004 report from the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) and AARP titled Caregiving in the U nited States2 and two follow - up report s titled Caregiving in the United States 20153 and Caregiving in the United States 2020.4 Data from these three national reports will be referred to within the findings of this state report as \"200 4 National Data,\" \"2015 National Data,\" and \"2020 National Data\" respectively. Findings Basics of Caregiving Situation Of the 7 69 individuals who were screened in the online survey, the proportion of initial respondents who stated they are or have been a caregiver i n the last 12 months , was 72% (n=553). One hundred twenty -five ( 125) of those identified caregivers failed to complete the remainder of the survey; therefore, data information will be provided based on those identified caregivers who completed the full survey (n=428) . Age, Gender, Race/Ethnicity of the Caregiver Approximately caregiver respondents were (n=368) , while 12% identified as male ( n=52), and less than 1 % percent identified as non- binary ( n=3). Caregivers ranging from 35 years of age to 54 years of age make up nearly half of the total respondents ( 48%, n=207). This data is comparable to 2020 National Data, which indicat ed that three (3) in five (5) caregivers are female (61%) an d the average caregiver age is 49.4 years old in the United States . 2 AARP and National Alliance for Caregiving.

More than t hree (3) out of every four (4) caregiver respondents identified as White/Caucasian (76%, n=327), 14% identified as American ( n=9) or Hispanic/Latino ( n=7). This data appears to also be comparable with 2020 National Data, except for Hispanic/Latino. Approximately 61 perce nt of respondents identify as White/Caucasian while 17 % are Hispanic/Latino, 14 % Black/African American, and 5 % Asian American and Pacific Islander, according to 2020 National Data. Three percent of 2020 National Data indicate multi -racial ethnicity.

Female , 368, 86%Male Status Of the 428 caregiver responses, roughly 4% indicated they had a military background (n=16), with one respondent indicating they are currently serving (0.23%, n=1). Alzheimer's and Dementia Thirteen Percent ( 13% ) of caregivers indicated the care recipient has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's or other dementia related diseases (n=56). Fifty -one ( 51) respondents indicated Alzheimer's or dementia as a primary diagnosis while the remaining 5 respondents indicated it was an additional diagnosis for the care recipient. Three (3) out of every 10 caregivers caring for someone with Alzheimer's or another dementia related illness were 65 years or older (30%, n=17) and almost four (4) out of 10 caregivers were aged 35 years to 54 years (39%, n=22). Careg ivers ranging from 18 years to 34 years made up 13% (n=7), while caregivers 55 years to 64 years old made up roughly 18 % (n=10). Caregivers for Alzheimer's and dementia diagnoses care recipients identified as majority White/Caucasian (79%, n= 44). Black/A frican American accounted (n=8), American Indian/Alaska Native for 2% (n=1), while the other 2% indicated ethic identity with two (2) or more options ( n=1). Additionally, nine (9) out of 10 caregivers in this group identified as female (91%, n=51) and 5 % as male (n=3). One respondent identified as non -binary.

Of the 428 responses received on the survey, nearly half ( 47%, n=191) reside in one of the three rural regions. The Coastal Plains counties account for 4% of th e total respondents. The Delta counties account for 11% of the total respondents. The Highlands counties account for 30% of the total respondents. The remaining 55% of respondents did not live in an identified rural county or region.

Over half of caregivers identifying Alzheimer's or dementia reside in an identified rural county, as established in the geographic demographics. Thirty -one ( 31) caregivers within 23 rural counties indicated they are caring for someone with Alzheimer's or dementia. Figure 6- Caregiver Rural Map (by County) Relationship of Caregiver to Care Recipient and Age The average age range indicated for caregivers was 35 years to 44 years old ( 26%, n=112). Closely following was the age range of 45 years to 54 years (22%, n= 95) and the s mallest age range completing the survey was the 18 years to 24 years (3%, n= 13). Age ranges for 25 years to 34 years , 55 years to 64 years, and 65 years and older came in slightly less than 20 % each ( 15%, n=65; 18%, n= 77; and 15%, For the purposes of this report, caregiver respondents will be grouped from 18 years to 34 years (n=78) , 35 year s to 54 years (n=207) , 55 years to 64 years (n=77) , and 65 and older (n=66) . An overwhelming majority of respondents indicated that the care recipient age range was 65 and older (35%, n=137). Approximately two (2) out of every 10 care recipients were aged five ( 5) years to 13 years (16%, n=61) while the age range of 55 years to 64 years averaged a little over one (1) out of 10 (12%, n=48). The remaining groups all indicated less than 10% of the responses in the following order: Less than 12 months (2%, n= 6); 12 months to 4 years (5%, n= 14 y ears to 18 years ( 7%, n=29); 19 years to 24 years (5%, n=18); and 35 years to 44 years (9%, n= 34). For this report, care recipients will be grouped Under 18 (30% , n=116), 19 years to 64 years (35% and 65 years and older (35% , n=137). Data elements indicate that older caregivers tend to be taking care of someone similar in age to themselves , while younger caregivers tend to care for the younger age range.

The relationship between caregiver and care recipient leaned largely to a Parent /In-Law status (36%, n=141) with Child /In-Law following ( 26%, n=102 ). Rounding out the includes friend, neighbor, and foster care. When comparing the care recipient's age to the caregiver relationship to that recipient, it was clear that some respondents misinterpreted the question of \"What is your relationship with this person? \". Based on the total data, it appears that some respondents answered this as to who they are in relation to the care recipient, while others answered as to who the care recipient is in relation to the m (the caregiver). This is evident in the fact that 41 respondents indicated they were a child or child in-law to their care recipient identified as less than 18 years of age ; therefore, fur ther clarity will be required with this question in future data collection activities to ensure relational direction is accurate. Figure 8- Caregiver Relationship in Relation to Care Recipient Age Caregiver Relationship to the Care Recipient Care Recipient Age Less than 18 Years 18 Years to 44 Years 45 Years to 64 Years 65 Years or potential misinterpretations When asked if the caregiver felt they had a choice in whether they took on their caregiver role, the percentage of caregivers directly related or married to the care recipient far exceeded the percentage of those non -related caregivers w ho felt they did not have a choice. Figure 9- Taking on Caregiver Role within Relationship Status Alzheimer's /Dementia Nearly 40% of Alzheimer's/Dementia caregivers indicated their relationship to the care recipient as Parent/In -Law (n=22) , spousal or , 5% indicated they were a sibling of the care recipient (n=3) , and 9% indicated non -relative status (n=5) identifications included grandparent and grandchild (7%, n=4) . Care Recipient Condition The top five (5) identified care recipient primary diagnoses (n=371) reported included the following: Developmental/Intellectual Developmental Brain Damage/Injury and other Neurological (6%, n= 23). Other neurological diagnosis includes Lou Gehrig's Disease (ALS), seizure disorders , multiple sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy . Caregivers were allowed to select multiple appropriate options when it came to comorbidities of the care recipient. Of those care recipients , 88% have comorbi dities (n=328) with over half having mobility issues, including feeble/unsteady or frequent falls (53%, n= 173). At least three out of every ten care recipients with comorbidities include a diagnosis of blood pressure issues or hypertension (35%, n=116) while almost one out of five also suffer from diabetes (18%, n=59). This data clearly shows that Arkansas caregivers not only have the stress of providing care for an induvial but are taking on that role to assist someone who may have increasingly complex med ical or support needs. 71% Care Recipient Comorbidities Forty -three percent of caregivers identified how long they have been providing care (n= 371) and indicated they have been a caregiver for a period of 1 -5 years (n=1 58). Twenty -six percent indicated they have been providing care for over ten years ( n=98); 19% for a period of 5-10 years (n=71) ; and 12% for less than 1 year (n=44) . 2020 National Data indicates the average duration of caregiving is 4.5 years , while the total number of years have increased since 2015 with 29% of caregivers now providing care for 5 years or longer. This number increased by 5% over 5 years (2015 indicating 24% of caregivers). Of those in our state survey who have been providing care for ten or more years (n=98) , two out of every 5 individuals were diagnosed with developmental/intellectual disabilities (DD/IDD) (n=40). Of those who have been providing care for less than 12 months (n=44), cancer was the top diagnosis (16%, n=7). Thirty percent of caregivers indicated that their care recipient had been hospitalized overnight at least once within the last 12 months (n=165). Forty -seven percent ( 47% ) of those care recipients (n=78) were hospitalized three (3) or more times within that year. Of the top 5 diagnoses with hospitalizations (n=82), 37 % of those who were hospitalized with cancer (n= 30) while 28 % of those hospitalized had a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or dementia (n=23). The remaining three top diagnosis - brain damage/injury, DD/IDD, and mental/emotional illness - made up another 35 % of hospitalizations (n=29). 2020 National Data indicates that there has been a decline in hospitalizations of care recipient s compared to their 2015 data. Within that five -year span, hospitalizations within a 12 -month period drop ped from 53% to 48% . The 2017 Arkansas caregiver feedback did not include this question ; therefore, there is no state data currently to compare. 173 116104 8777 595645454441403829262521196 020406080100120140160180200Care Recipient ComorbiditiesFigure 11- Care Recipient Hospitalizations Care Recipient Military Status Of the 388 caregivers who responded, approximately 8% of care recipients they care for have a military background (n=32). None indicated that a care recipient was currently serving at this time. Caregiving Activities and Level of Care Of the caregivers who indicated a level of assistance within a normal week (n=428), 35% indicated t hey provide care off and on around the clock (n=150) while 26% indicated they provide care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (n=113). Twenty -one percent (21%) of caregivers indicated they only receive small breaks during the day or just to sleep (n=91). Four percent ( 4%) provide care occasionally throughout the week (n=16) , and another 4% as needed (n=16). The remaining half percent (0.5%) provide care on we ekends only (n=2). Analysis of the data shows confusion between two of the data points in particular: providing care off and on around the clock and only receiving small breaks during the day or just to sleep. Future studies will need to clarify and stream line this data better to delineate more clearly. When asked which tasks caregivers assist their care recipient with, caregivers were allowed to select multiple answers depending upon what was appropriate for their situation. Based on those that provided an swers (n=425), the top five tasks include transfers (80%, n=338), transportation (75%, n=317), meal TOP 5 DIAGNOSESFigure 12- Caregiver Tasks Other tasks include additional personal care tasks (i.e.: brushing, braiding hair), communication assistance, hospice care, and rehab therapy assistance. Alzheimer's and Dementia For those caregivers caring for those diagnosed with Alzheimer's or other de mentia -related diseases (n=56), 71% indicated they provide care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week or 24/7 with an occasional small break or to sleep (n=40). Level of assistance with tasks were higher and more widespread for those providing care for Alzheimer's and dementia. Of the tasks available to select, only two (2) were below 50% selected: feeding and assistance with incontinence/diapers. Additionally, 100% of caregivers in this category indicated they assisted their care recipient with transferring, either to and from chairs, beds, or the toilet. Figure 13- Caregiver Tasks Other Help Of the caregivers who have provided care within the last 12 months (n =425 ), only 32% indicated they had re ceived some form of assistance or help from aides, housekeepers, or other people who were paid or unpaid to assist (n=136). Ninety -six percent ( 96% ) of those that received assistance, received unpaid assistance , while 76% received paid assistance. Fifty (50) caregivers indicated that their care recipient is or was on either Medicaid Waiver or State Plan services offered through DHS. Twenty -nine ( 29) caregivers indicated their care recipient was part of a waitlist while 40 caregivers indicated that their care recipient was denied services. Twenty -eight percent (28% ) of those receiving services were part of Arkansas' s PASSE (Provider -Led Arkansas Shared Savings Entity) program, serving Medicaid clients with complex behavioral health, developmental or intellectual disabilities (n=14). Twenty -six percent ( 26% ) indicated their care recipient received TEFRA (The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act) aimed to help families with children younger than 19 years old who have a disability. Twenty -two percent ( 22% ) of those receiving DHS services are in the ARChoices Medicaid Home and Community -based Program (n=11), while 6% are receiving services through Arkansas' self- direction personal care program, IndependentChoices (n=3). Sixteen percent (16% ) received services through the Arkansas Autism Partnership (AAP) Medicaid waiver program and only one (1) individual is receiving services through Arkansas' Community and Employment Supports (CES) waiver and the Program of All- Inclusive Care for the Elderly, PACE (n=1). Ot hers indicated they received financial assistance through SNAP, ARKids insurance, and general Medicaid. Figure 14- Receipt of Medicaid/State Plan Services Note: Some service recipients indicated multiple services ( i.e.: waiver program and SNAP); therefore , totals equal more than 100% Alzheimer's and Dementia Nine percent ( 9%) of caregivers for Alzheimer's and dementia indicated that their care recipient was receiving Medicaid Waiver or State Plan services, the key services being ARChoices and 14 11 38 113 15Care Recipients Receiving Medicaid/State Plan ServicesIndependentChoices (n=5). An additional 1 3% indicated they were on a waitlist (n= 7) wh ile another 11% indicated they (n=6 ). Fifty -five percent ( 55% ) of the 56 caregivers also indicated they had received either paid or unpaid assistance during the last 12 months. Wellbeing of Caregiver Caregiver s were asked to evaluate their own overall health assessment in the categories of poor, fair, good, very good, and excellent. Only 6 of all caregiver respondents indicated that their overall health assessment was excellent, leaving almost 99% of caregivers indicating that their health is less than excellent, while simultaneously caring for another individual. Of those 6 caregivers, 66% (n=4) were females and 50% were caring for recipients 65 years or older. Fifty percent ( 50% ) (n=3) of caregivers have a grandparent/grandchild relationship to their care recipient wh ile 33% (n=2) have a parental relationship and the remaining 17% (n=1) were a non-relative. 2020 National Data indicate s 41% of caregivers report their overall health status as excellent or very good ( down from 4 8% nationally in 2015); 21% report fair or poor health status (up from 17% in 2015) . Nationally , 51% of caregivers indicate that they feel their role as a caregiver gives them a sense of purpose6. Our state survey respondents also indicated that 52% of t hose providing care felt their role gives or gave them a sense of purpose or meaning in their life (n=222). When asked if the caregiver felt alone or lonely because of their caregiver role, 37% indicated yes (n=158). This is higher than the 2020 National Data which indicated 21% of national respondents fe lt alone . Whereas nationally approximately 1 in 5 individuals indicat ed feelings of loneliness while caring for another individual, greater than 1 in 3 Arkansas car egivers indicated feel ings of loneliness associated with caregiving . Fifty -three percent ( 53% ) of caregivers indicated they did not feel they had a choice in ta king on their role as a caregiver (n=225) , which is equal to the percentage of caregivers on a national scale (2020 National Data: 53%). When asked if they, as a caregiver, found it difficult to take care of their own health while caring for another, 43% i ndicated yes (n=185). For Arkansas caregivers t his indicates almost double the 2020 National Data percentage, where nearly one in four indicated yes ( 23%). Arkansas caregivers are nearly twice as likely to find it difficult to care for their own health whe n faced with caring for the health of another. This raises concerning questions as to whether caregivers, particularly those 40 years and older, are neglecting their own age appropriate examinations due to their caregiving responsibilities (ex. mammogram, colonoscopy, prostate exam, eye exams, etc.) ? National research has found that multi- level stressors and responsibilities placed on a caregiver, including strains placed by caregivers that are still in the workforce, increase a caregiver's strain in all areas including physical, emotional, social, psychological, and leads to an overall caregiver burden higher 6 AARP and National Alliance for Caregiving.

The high -strain lifestyle roles that caregivers take on increase s the risk that the caregiver will experience declining mental and psychological health, such as depression and anxiety.7 Figure 15- Caregiver's Overall Wellbeing (State vs. National) Additionally, when comparing rural caregivers with urban caregivers, urban caregivers identified slight ly higher for caregiver well- being impa cts than their rural counterparts. This may be due to the fact that caregivers identified 5% more urban than rural in geographic location. Figure 16- Caregiver's Overall Wellbeing (Rural vs. Urban) 7 Kayaalp, A., Page, K.

Urban caregivers ranked higher than rural caregivers when it came to emotional strain by 4% ; however, rural caregivers indicated more financial and physical strain than their urban counterparts by 5% . Figure 17. Caregiver Strain (Rural vs. Urban) Financial I mpact National data indicates \"the lower the income and education a person has, the more likely he or she is a caregiver,\" and that \"47% of caregivers have an annual household income of less than $50,000, with a median income of $54,700.\" 8 Of the 425 caregiver respondents within our survey , 65% indicated a total annual household income (from all sources) of less than $30,000 (n=277). Twelve percent ( 12% ) indicated an annual income between $30,000 and $49,999 (n=51) while another 26% indicated between $50,000 and $99,999 Less than 10% had an income over $100,000 (n= 24). This far exceeds national data as 77% of caregivers who participated in our survey indicate an income less than $50,000 . 8 Family Caregiver Alliance. Caregiver (Rural vs. Urban) Rural UrbanFigure 18- Caregiver Household Income Additionally, 16 out of the 24 (67%) caregivers that indicated $100,000 or more in annual household income also indicated that they had received assistance, either paid or unpaid, during the last 12 months. This data indicates those with a higher household income are more likely to receive outside help, whether paid or unpaid. By contrast, only 105 out of the 277 (38%) of caregivers that indicated a household income of less than $30,000 had received ei ther paid or unpaid assistance. Those with lower household income carry a higher burden not only financially but physically as well, as they receive much lower levels of caregiver assistance. This lower economic demographic of caregivers also tends to be sicker themselves due to compounding issues related to poverty.9 Figure 19- Caregiver's Annual Income vs. Received Assistance 9 BlueCross Blue Shield Associa tion.

Financial strain did decrease slightly as annual household income increased. Figure 20- Financial Strain vs. Household Income Male caregivers responded with a higher average financial stress rating than females (male=4.0; female= 3.7) while caregivers identifying as non -binary indicated the highest average financ ial stress rating of 4.3. Caregivers identifying with two or more ethnic categories averaged 4.6 out of 5. Caregivers located in established rural counties and non -rural counties alike averaged a similar financial strain (rural= 3.7; non -rural= 3.8). Care givers providing for care recipients diagnosed with Alzheimer's or other dementia s also averaged 3.7 out of 5. Data does show that caregiver age and care recipient age both effect the level of financial stress to the caregiver. Younger caregivers reported higher financial stress than older caregivers; likewise, caregivers caring for younger recipients reported a higher financial stress than those caring for older adults.

Caregivers were given the option to select multiple financial impacts that applied to them, 88% of caregivers indicated more than one impact (n=313). Forty -eight percent ( 48% ) of caregivers indicated that they have taken on more debt as a caregiver (n=171) and over half (53%) have had to borrow money from friends or family (n= 189). Two of every 3 caregivers have either paid bills late or left them unpaid (n= 233) and 1 out of every 6 have had late student loan payments (n=54). Seventy -one percent ( 71% ) of caregivers indicated they had stopped saving or stopped trying to save money (n= 252). Over half of caregiver respondents have exhausted their personal short -term savings (n=183) , while 1 out of 5 caregivers have used long- term savings like retirement monies to pay for things needed. Approximately one (1) in five (5) caregivers indicated they came out of retirement or took on a second job to meet financial needs (n=75) while 8% indicated they delayed retirement or decided not to retire (n=28). One in every ten caregivers indicated they have filed for bankruptcy (n=34) and one in every four indicated they had to relocate to less expensive housing (n= 87) in order to make ends meet. Nine percent ( 9%) of caregivers indicated they had been evicted or had their home foreclosed (n=32). Finally , approximately four out of nine caregivers stated they were unable to afford basic expenses like food (n=158). When compared to 2020 national data collected by AARP for the caregiver's financial impact, financial impacts to Arkansas caregivers are double d, if not three or four times higher, than the national numbers in almost all comparable categories except for long- term care savings. Comparable categories include taking on more debt, borrowing from friends/family, inability to afford basic needs, unpaid or late bill payments, use of short -term and long -term savings, and the cessation of saving money all together.10 10 AARP and National Alliance for Caregiving.

Employed caregivers often feel a strain of priorities and commitments between their job and their caregiving duties. One hundred thirty -four ( 134) of the 281 Arkansas caregivers who have been employed indicated that their supervisor was either unaware of their caregiver responsibilities or they were unsure if the supervisor was aware ( 48%). Only 21% of these caregivers indicated they experienced no hardship or impact to their job (n=58); however, 79% i ndicated they had at least one work impact affecting them when it related to their caregiver status (n=223) . Sixty -three percent (63% ) of employed caregivers experienced tardiness, had to leave work early or take time off work in relation to caregiver responsibilities (n=179). Twenty -seven percent ( 27% ) indicated they had to stop working entirely or take early retirement (n=75). These numbers are comparable to national data in work impact; however, specific impacts range higher within Arkansas respondents than nationally. 11 AARP and National Alliance for Caregiving.

Caregiving in the United States 2020 Caregiver Impacts in the Workplace (State vs. National) Additional work impacts that Arkansas caregivers identified in the state survey included reduced work hours (n=102) , turning down a promotion or extra responsibility (n=69) , loss of job benefits (n=28) , and receiving a warning or disciplinary action about their performance or attendance at work (n=63) . Figure 24- Additional Caregiver Work Impacts (State Only) Where Caregivers Seek Information and Supports During the survey, caregivers were asked to identify all places th ey use to learn more or gather more information to better help them as a caregiver. Caregivers were allowed to select multiple options as they related to them. Ninety percent ( 90% ) of caregivers provided feedback to this question (n=385) with a predominant response indicating they look to their doctors or other health care professionals for information (67%, n=259). Half of the caregivers who responded also indicated they seek information and guidance from family and friends ( 49%, n=190) , while approximately four out of ten caregivers look online or to social media ( 42%, n=160). 79% Impact for Caregivers 10%22%Additional Work Impacts for Arkansas CaregiversFigure 25- Accessing Information Knowledge and Access to Respite Thirty -eight percent ( 38% ) of national caregivers believe that receiving respite care would be beneficial to them as a caregiver but less than half of them have ever used respite services.13 Less than 25% of caregiver respondents in Arkansas indicated they have heard of caregiver respite (n=103) and only 27% of those who have heard of respite know where to find or access it within Arkansas (n=28); less than 10% of the total number of caregivers surveyed . More concerning is the fact that only approximately 7% of caregivers surveyed had experienced the benefit of respite , compared with the national percentage of 14%.14 Twenty -nine ( 29) caregivers indicated they had used respite it the past 12 months and 55 % of t hose caregivers indicated they had a n easy to very easy time accessing it (n=16). The remaining 45% indicated that it was not an easy process (n=13) . Caregivers were allowed to choose from several activities typically used when respite time has been offer ed. Caregivers were allowed to select multiple activities they would consider doing or participating in if they were to receive a caregiver break with respite. Of the 428 caregivers, over 50% indicated they would take the time to just rest and relax in gen eral. One of every four caregivers indicated they would like to participate in physical activity or exercise, and social/recreational activities, including church events. There were a similar number of caregivers who also selected activities including spending time with spouse, partner or other family and friends, and pursuing their own hobbies and intere sts. It should be noted that approximately four of every ten caregive rs (40%) stated they would use their break time to run needed errands or to complete household tasks. Twelve percent ( 12% ) of caregivers selected other activities with write-in responses of taking a small vacation, taking classes, or completing 13 AARP and National Alliance for Caregiving.

Figure 26- Respite Limitations Limitations of this study were apparent when comparisons and benchmarking were performed between national and state specific data. Parallels could not be directly drawn between some key data points. In the future, studies will strive to mirror national data collection methods , and state 's specific d ata collection , from those states with similar population, demographic , and socioeconomic markers. Easier comparisons and contrasting of data will help Arkansas benchmark the work we are doing . When we can properly compare our work to National respite data , we will have a greater understanding of the areas where we lack, and the areas where we are excelling in respite provision. Additionally, continued data collection within the state will assist in determining any strides or setbacks we are making in our respite service goals. Conclusions In conclusion, more research is necessary to determine why caregiving outcomes in Arkansas are worse than national averages. What makes Arkansas caregivers feel 50% more lonely than the national average caregiver? Is it due to our higher rural demographic? Other states comparable to Arkansas 's rurality , like Texas, have state specific reports regarding informal caregiving. Future Arkansas studies should explore some of the same data analyzed in the Texas specific report for benchmarking purposes. Additionally, data collected in Arkansas needs to mirror national data collection for more in -depth national benchmarking. Some of our worse outcomes were due to lower socioeconomic status as compared to national data. Arkansas has lower wages which leads to higher levels of poverty. W hile less than half of national respondents (47%) indicated annual household income of less than $50,000, more than 3 out of every 4 caregivers (77%) in the State of Arkansas has a household incom e of less than $50,000. The financial 30%37%40%38%56%28%25%24%12%12% Spending Time w/ Spouse or PartnerSpending Time w/ Other Respite Time (n=428)impact of caregiving in the State of Arkansas far outstrips the national burden. More than half of Arkansans (53%) qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).15 Without proper support to this group, Arkansas faces a potential housing and public health crisis. The need for more infrastructure supports for this population is apparent. This group is at risk and financially vulnerable. Caregivers are living paycheck to paycheck . This puts the care reci pient at risk . No longer having the ability to save money , as indicated by survey responses , and more than half of caregivers exhausting what savings they did have, creates potential for high rates of housing insecurity within this population. Nearly 99% of respondents in the Arkansas study indicated their health is less than excellent. Are these caregivers getting necessary health care themselves? Are they neglecting preventative medical exams to care for the recipient? Do those with less than excelle nt health have medical insurance? How are those under the age of 65 getting health care if they are unable to work due to caregiving responsibilities? This may be why 66% are still working or why they have less than excellent health; they are uninsured. In 2018, Blue Cross Blue Shield reported that 25% of commercially insured and Medicaid Fee -For-Service Arkansans are in need of caregiving.16 In most cases employment is a prerequisite of health coverage. Sixty -six percent (66%) of Arkansas caregivers are employed while providing caregiving. Caregivers find it difficult to work and provide caregiving. Half of Arkansas caregivers indicated they have not or feel they cannot tell their employer about their caregiving responsibilitie s. Further research is neede d regarding uninsured rates amongst caregivers. How many caregivers work because they would not have health insurance otherwise ? If given an option to not work and have health care, would caregivers take it? Identifying the source of insurance for those that do have insurance coverage is also important as that will provide a better understand ing as to why some individuals are choosing to continue to work. Additional research is also needed to further understand employment impacts, and the effect on Arkansas's economy to lost working hours and wages due to caregiving responsibilities. Arkansas caregivers are nearly 3 times as likely to stop working or retire early, versus their national counterparts. Nearly 80% of working Arkansas caregivers indicated at least one work impact due to their caregiver responsibilities. More than one -third indicated they have a reduction in work hours due to caregiving, and 1 in every 4 caregivers seeking employment indicated they were turned down for a job due to their caregiving responsibilities. This may be the answer to why half of employed caregivers do not feel they can or have not told their employers about their caregiver status. Discrimination in the workplace against caregivers is concerning. F ederal laws protect the rights of employees and allow up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to care for a sick family member. Certain criteria must be met in order to qualify . More research is needed to determine if e mployees are aware of the availability of FMLA leave . More research is also needed regarding how caregivers would use their respite time, as seeking their own medical care was not an option to choose from. 15 Feeding America.

More individuals would likely take advantage of a respite program if they knew more about it , and knew it was available to them.
