I NTRODUCTION Context of Diversity and Cultural Competence in Health Care The steadily increasing diversity of the United States affects health care providers and institutions, from small rural towns to large urban centers. The impact of this diversity means that every day, health care providers encounter, and must learn to manage, complex differences in communication styles, attitudes, expectations, and world views. Decades of literature from the social and clinical sciences have documented the details, effects, and potential remedies to issues that arise when different cultures encounter each other. Health care providers take many different approaches to bridge barriers to communication and understand\u00ad ing that stem from racial, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences. In recent years, the notion of cultural competence has come to encompass both interpersonal and organizational interventions and strategies that seek to facilitate the achievement of clinical and public health goals when those differences come into play. There have been many attempts to describe and quantify cultural competence in health care. These include formal definitions; model programs; laws, regulations, and standards; performance measures and other evaluative criteria. But what does cultural competence actually accomplish ? Does it make a difference to patients and to health care delivery and health outcomes? This project looks at the question of what impact cultural competence interventions have on the delivery of health care and health outcomes, and investigates the opportunities and barriers that affect how further research in this area might be conducted. The CLAS Standards and Cultural Competence Research Agenda Projects This document is the final report for the Cultural Competence Research Agenda project, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health (OMH) and Agency for Health- care Research and Quality (AHRQ) to examine how cultural competence affects health care delivery and health outcomes. It completes a process begun in 1998 with the OMH-sponsored development of national standards for culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS) in health care. The CLAS standards were published in the Federal Register in December 2000 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser\u00ad vices Office of the Secretary, 2000), and have become the basis for subsequent government and private sector activities to define, implement, and evaluate cultural competence activities among health care provid\u00ad ers. The CLAS standards were initially derived from an analysis of current practice and policy on cultural competence, and further shaped by the input and expertise of health care providers, policymakers, research\u00aders, advocates, and consumers. The 14 standards are organized by themes: Culturally Competent Care (standards 1-3), Language Access Services (standards 4-7), and Organizational Supports for Cultural Com\u00ad petence (standards 8-14). Standards 1-7 address interventions that have the most direct impact on clinical care; and standards 8-14 address organizational structures, policies and processes that support the imple\u00ad mentation of standards 1-7. The CLAS standards were developed to provide a common understanding and consistent definitions of culturally and linguistically appropriate services in health care. They are intended to offer a broad and practical framework for the implementation of services and organizational structures that can help health care providers be responsive to the cultural and linguistic issues presented by diverse populations. While SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 3 PART ONE: INTRODUCTION aimed primarily at health care organizations, individual clinicians are also encouraged to use the standards to make their practices more culturally and linguistically accessible. The standards are intended to be inclusive of all cultures and not limited to any particular population group or sets of groups; however, they are espe\u00ad cially designed to address the needs of racial, ethnic, and linguistic population groups that experience unequal access to health services. It was the understanding of the CLAS standards sponsors that wide adoption of cultural competence activi\u00ad ties, as described in the standards, would ideally be supported by research that makes a link between the performance of those activities, improved health care delivery and better health outcomes. Many health care providers and policymakers have fundamental questions about the intrinsic and relative value of differ\u00adent cultural competence methods and programs. These questions may relate to: Access and outcomes (which interventions increase access for culturally and linguistically diverse populations to health care services and/or improve their health outcomes?) Quality and reduction in errors (which interventions increase the provision of appropriate care to and/or reduce the incidence of medical errors among diverse populations?) Cost (which interventions are cost effective\u2014e.g., reduce diagnostic testing and emergency room use or increase preventive services lowering future health costs?) Comparative analyses (which approaches or interventions work best under which circum\u00ad stances?) OMH and AHRQ sponsored the development of a health services research agenda on cultural competence in health care to promote the creation of an evidence base that would address these questions. Objectives of Cultural Competence Research How best to pursue further research on cultural competence interventions depends greatly on the kinds of questions stakeholders want answers to. Different stakeholders may have different informational needs, and these needs, while convergent at times, may vary in the order of importance from one stakeholder group to the next. For example, basic definitions and parameters are needed for every category of cultural competence inter\u00ad vention. These definitions are critical, not only to support basic program design and evaluation, but also to facilitate the evaluation of additional research on outcomes where standard definitions are necessary for comparability of results. Research required to produce these definitions and identify the standard elements of interventions is not methodologically difficult, but some stakeholders may perceive this work as less important because it does not directly address outcomes that are more important to them. It is likely that this type of research will be of greatest interest to those attempting to standardize interventions for the purposes of quality control; regulators and standard setters; individuals who design and implement cultural compe\u00ad tence interventions; and investigators who need standard definitions for conducting cultural competence research. Stakeholders who are primarily interested in the success of the clinical encounter (e.g., patients, families, and clinical staff), may have more interest in the impact that cultural competence interventions have on what are often called intermediary outcomes (e.g., comprehension, satisfaction, adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations, appropriate utilization). Those who pay for health care are especially interested in how cultural competence interventions affect utilization of services. Because of the large number of potentially confounding variables, it is very difficult to show a direct link between a cultural competence 4 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART ONE: INTRODUCTION intervention and health status improvements and/or cost savings. It may be, however, possible to link to\u00ad gether a number of intermediary outcomes that contribute to health status improvements and/or cost sav\u00ad ings. For example: CLAS better communication (measured by comprehension, satisfaction, etc.) better adherence to medications and lifestyle changes improved health status lower undesirable health care use (ED visits, hospitalization, etc.) To integrate multiple perspectives, the project team applied a common set of outcomes research questions to cultural competence interventions to develop a research agenda that cuts across stakeholders' interests. Did the intervention do what it was supposed to do? For example: Did provider knowledge/awareness improve after training? Did patients in need of culturally competent services receive them? Were written translations understandable? Did the intervention affect processes of care? These might include: Provider behavior modification Patient comprehension, participation in communication, treatment negotiation Time spent with the physician Diagnostic accuracy Did the intervention improve access to services and/or appropriate utilization of services? Measures might include: Receipt of diagnostic tests, appropriate medications, preventive/specialist services Number of admissions Hospital days, length of stay, bounce-back/recidivism Preventable hospitalization Inappropriate usage of services (e.g., ED) Most-to-least restrictive setting progression Error reduction and/or patient safety Medication errors, inappropriate treatment, unnecessary procedures Did the intervention affect patient satisfaction and health behaviors? Other measures might include: Patient trust Acceptance of preventive services SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 5 PART ONE: INTRODUCTION Adherence to medications, appointments, lifestyle change recommendations Patient loyalty Health seeking behavior Did the intervention affect patient health outcomes? These might include: Better control of chronic disease symptoms Improved health status: Self-report Established medical outcomes Quality of life Population-based/community-level indicators: Morbidity, mortality Prevalence/incidence of disease Level of acuity Did the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of health care delivery change? For example: Does it take more time to use a trained vs. untrained interpreter? Did the intervention reduce inappropriate care, resulting in cost savings? Did the intervention increase preventive care/early intervention that reduced treatment costs? Contrary to popular perception, research in many of these areas has begun and is of growing interest to the health services research community. Much of this work looks at the impact of attempting to improve com\u00admunication between clinicians and patients when cultural or linguistic factors are involved. However, further work is needed to raise awareness about the existing evidence base on cultural competence interventions, and to promote continued research in this area. Advancing a cultural competence research agenda involves many tasks. Specific research questions need to be identified. Funding must be made available for this research. A cadre of interested researchers needs to be cultivated and networked. Data sets need to be identified and analyzed. Most importantly, the results of research must be made widely available to practitio\u00adners, policymakers, and other researchers. Another important task, given the limited resources available for research on cultural competence interven\u00ad tions, is improved information-sharing about research projects to share research instruments and methods, promote collaboration, avoid duplication, and maximize limited funding. While no single study is definitive and additional research is always needed to confirm the validity of initial studies, better awareness of, and coordination of efforts, could advance critical areas of research more efficiently. Recently published studies reinforce the intuition that a lack of attention to cultural issues leads to less than optimal health care, and that addressing these concerns or using certain cultural competence interventions leads to improved outcomes. This research does not exist for every population or every type of cultural competence intervention\u2014most of it is concentrated on the impact of language or communication barri\u00aders\u2014but it is sufficient to suggest that additional work in this area is warranted. 6 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART ONE: OVERVIEW II. O VERVIEW OF THE CULTURAL COMPETENCE RESEARCH AGENDA PROJECT Project Goals and Objectives The main goal of the Cultural Competence Research Agenda Project is to produce and disseminate to key stakeholders a research agenda on the relationship between cultural competence interventions and health care delivery and health outcomes. This goal has been accomplished through completion of the following tasks: Developing a working consensus on the parameters and specifics of cultural competence inter\u00adventions for the purposes of conducting health care delivery and health outcomes research. Collecting, reviewing and making available to the public abstracts of published, unpublished, and in-progress research on cultural competence. Identifying key research questions on cultural competence that have been the subject of re\u00adsearch, and describing the strengths and limitations of this research. Identifying key research questions on cultural competence that have yet to be studied. Identifying issues related to study design, potential data sources and study sites. Identifying larger contextual issues related to cultural competence research: how to interest potential researchers, linking content experts with research experts, researcher collaboration/ networking, funding for research, publication, and how to involve and gain the support of re\u00ad search stakeholders (providers, policymakers, consumers) in the identification and utilization of research findings. Project Methodology Preparing the cultural competence research agendas involved a multi-step process: 1) conducting a litera\u00ad ture review, 2) convening a Research Advisory Committee (RAC), and 3) drafting, soliciting comments on, and revising the research agenda. The project was guided by the following definition of cultural competence used in the CLAS Standards Report (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Secretary, 2000). Cultural and linguistic competence is a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals that enables effective work in cross-cultural situations. 'Culture' refers to integrated patterns of human behavior that in- clude the language, thoughts, communications, actions, customs, beliefs, values, and institu- tions of racial, ethnic, religious, or social groups. 'Competence' implies having the capacity to function effectively as an individual and an organization within the context of the cultural beliefs, behaviors, and needs presented by consumers and their communities. Conduct Literature Review A multi-source, first-run literature search was conducted to identify research that used empirical analysis to measure the impact of culturally and linguistically competent interventions on outcomes, specifically issues SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 7 PART ONE: OVERVIEW related to access, utilization and health status. A substantial number of published studies in this area docu\u00ad ment racial and ethnic health disparities, present arguments for integrating culturally competent interven\u00ad tions, or describe models and methodologies. However, the goal of this search was to quantify and analyze the research base where the primary focus is the measurement of the impact of the intervention. The project team developed a key word template consisting of approximately 177 terms and word combina\u00ad tions using as a framework the cultural competence interventions listed in the CLAS Standards Report (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Secretary, 2000), supplemented by interventions cataloged by Brach and Fraser (2000). The CLAS Standards Report describes 14 actions that can be taken by health care organizations to improve cultural and linguistic competency; Brach and Fraser sets out nine interventions that could be used to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities. The list of cultural competence interventions can be found at the beginning of Part Two of this report. A complete list of search terms used can be found in Appendix One. The template was applied to major literature databases, including MEDLINE\u00ae (1963-2001). In an attempt to identify additional research, publications, or projects relating to cultural and linguistic com\u00adpetence, a Web site search was also conducted. This entailed the review of 38 private foundations currently funding public health and health services initiatives, 58 health policy organizations and associations, and the government Web sites of all Federal health and human services agencies and bureaus. Information about unpublished studies and research in progress was gleaned from these sources and also from the project Research Advisory Committee and other individuals interested in research on cultural competence. Convene Research Advisory Committee A Research Advisory Committee (RAC) of key researchers, policymakers and health care providers was convened to review the literature and make recommendations for a research agenda to pursue work in this area. The 30-member RAC met in Washington, DC in April 2001 for a two-and-a-half day meeting to review the analysis of the literature on cultural competence and outcomes. The RAC was divided into three groups according to interest area and expertise to develop research questions for their topic areas and discuss methodological concerns related to conducting research in that area. The group also met as a whole to discuss overarching issues related to the definitions, study design, and funding/publication challenges of cultural competence research, which are described in Part Three of this report. A complete contact list of the RAC members, along with select meeting materials, can be found in Appendix Three. Draft, Solicit Comments on, and Revise Research Agenda Drawing on the RAC's recommendations and findings from the literature review, the project team prepared individual research agendas for each of the main topic areas. The draft agendas were sent to RAC mem\u00ad bers for comment. Public comment was solicited by posting the draft agendas on the DiversityRx Web site (www.diverstyRx.org/rcproj1) and circulating them to the National Council on Interpretation in Health Care LISTSERV\u00ae. The draft agendas were revised and the final versions are contained in Part Two of this report. 8 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART ONE: OVERVIEW Highlights of Literature Review Findings The literature review revealed a considerable amount of descriptive literature on each of the interventions. Although this information does not present a scientifically based argument for the use of most of these interventions, it supports the initiation and continuation of research in this area. Additionally, the value of descriptive literature should not be overlooked in the research development process. Descriptive information can provide the foundation for model duplication, identification of best practices, meta-analysis, identification of standard measures and instruments, hypothesis generation and further empirical research. This search uncovered only a limited number of published studies for each of the interventions that employed rigorous research methodologies, and these are described in more detail in the literature analyses and matri\u00adces contained in Appendix Two and the abstracts contained in Appendix Four. Some of the well-established, non-cultural competence specific-approaches, such as health promotion and education, have, through an evolutionary process, incorporated certain elements that enhance outreach efforts and service delivery to multicultural communities. In these instances, the descriptive and empirical research base was substantially larger than some of the more recently recognized interventions such as cultural competence training. Although limited in scope and depth, the body of existing empirical studies does suggest that several of the proposed interventions have the potential to affect health care delivery and health outcomes. Culturally sensitive interventions such as cultural competence training and racial and ethnic concordance have shown improvements in subjective, self-assessed measures of provider knowledge and patient satisfaction. Health promotion and education programs that utilize interpreters, community health workers, translated materials and other culturally sensitive approaches reported increases in intake, program completion, and knowledge. Studies examining the impact of community health workers and traditional healers were almost non-existent compared to the large volume of descriptive literature detailing the use of these practices. Studies examining the impact of linguistic and communication interventions on outcomes were found to have different degrees of effectiveness on patient satisfaction and health services utilization. No literature was identified that spe\u00ad cifically examined both the processes and outcomes of organizational accommodations for cultural and linguistic competence. In sum, the literature reveals promising trends in outcomes-related research that should be further explored. Certain cultural competence interventions appear to affect health services utilization, satisfaction, and in\u00ad creases in knowledge, although subsequent impacts on provider or patient behavior and/or health outcomes were not explored. Some studies that measured outcomes for specific interventions revealed contradictory and inconclusive results, due to significant variations in definitions, study design or approach. Their findings cannot be easily generalized, further supporting the need for additional research. Clearly, the results of this literature search demonstrate an opportunity to further build an evidence base linking cultural competent interventions to specific impacts on outcomes. Additionally, future literature reviews that search for specific outcomes may result in a more comprehensive set of literature findings. However, this would require significantly more searches and review time and a clear definition of outcomes being sought. There are many outcomes that could be examined such as health services utilization, satisfaction, compliance, health knowledge, communication, improved health outcomes, etc. However, it may be very difficult to identify and link specific interventions and approaches to these improvements. It may also be difficult to link interventions of integrated culturally sensitive approaches to positive outcomes if those interventions were not the main focus of the study. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 9 PART ONE: OVERVIEW Highlights of the Research Agendas The successes and limitations of the existing impact literature on cultural competence point to substantial opportunities for future research in each of the identified categories. Using both descriptive and quantitative approaches, this research can further illuminate the details of cultural competence interventions as well as specific impacts on health care delivery outcomes. The major task of this project was to propose future research directions in the area of cultural competence and health care delivery and health outcomes. By analyzing the literature, the project team was able to identify areas where the current research was weak or lacking, and suggest areas and questions for further exploration. These efforts were buttressed by the discussions and recommendations of the RAC, both during the April 2001 RAC meeting and in subsequent reviews of the research agenda drafts. The major product of this endeavor is the group of research agendas found in Part Two of the report. Each research agenda contains a definition of the category, a brief synthesis of findings from the literature, key research questions, and a discussion of methodological and policy considerations influencing future research for that area. The research agendas reflect that some of the topic areas were backed by a greater body of literature and/ or generated more interest from RAC members. The extensive agenda developed for the language assis\u00adtance interventions category mirrors its prominence among both health care providers and policymakers. It is also the agenda best supported by previous research related to outcomes. Additional topics generating significant interest included cultural competence education and training, and racial, ethnic and linguistic concordance. The topic of organizational supports generated a broad list of questions, although the majority of these focused on their effect on the processes of health care delivery and not on health outcomes. It is interesting to note that as stakeholder interest and investment in implementing certain interventions increases (e.g., interpreter services, hiring for diversity, cultural competence training), so too does the de\u00ad mand for concrete linkages between an intervention and outcomes, especially cost-related benefits. Conversely, there are many providers who are willing to undertake these interventions without \"proof of value,\" perhaps simply due to consumer demand for such interventions or because the face value of the intervention is obvious. Many RAC members pointed out that, methodological and funding challenges aside, the importance of outcomes research on cultural competence interventions should not be overstated, given that many cultural competence interventions have already been implemented despite the lack of rigorously conducted, definitive outcomes studies. The following highlights of the Cultural Competence Research Agenda are organized into three groups of cultural competence interventions: Category A: Culturally Sensitive Interventions Category B: Language Assistance Category C: Organizational Supports for Cultural Competence. A complete list of research questions can be found in Part Two of the report. 10 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART ONE: OVERVIEW Category A: Culturally Sensitive Interventions Cultural Competence Education and Training Among the activities listed under Category A, cultural competence education and training generates consid\u00ad erable interest among providers, educators, and policymakers for its potential impact on improving the pa\u00adtient-provider relationship when cultural differences exist. While the descriptive literature on this topic is extensive, studies that examine the impact of training on either trainees and patients is more limited. Some connections are made with increases in levels of cultural knowledge, attitudes and awareness, and improve\u00adments in communication skills among trainees. Few studies examined the impact of training on health care delivery, patient behavior change, or health outcomes. The topic and the literature, however, were sufficient to inspire a substantial number of future research questions. These include questions that seek to better understand and define the intervention related to: Trainees and motivation (e.g., what incentives are sufficient to motivate clinicians to undertake cultural competence training\u2014improved patient-provider relationship, improved health outcomes, financial rewards?) Content of training (e.g., what competencies and basic skills produce behavioral changes by trainees and improvement in health and health care delivery outcomes?) Form of training (e.g., which educational delivery techniques are most effective at changing trainee behavior?) Another category of questions seeks to measure the impact of training on both providers and patients. These include questions on: Achieving behavioral changes among trainees (e.g., what degree of knowledge or awareness translates into action? Is there a dose-response relationship for certain training interventions, and what is the minimum intervention that will result in acceptable outcomes?) Measuring impact on health care delivery and health outcomes (e.g., do patients of providers who have received training show improvements in satisfaction, adherence to treatment recom\u00admendations, keeping recommended follow-up visits, etc.?) Racial, Ethnic, and Linguistic Concordance The topic of racial, ethnic and linguistic concordance among providers and patients has already generated considerable research interest. The literature suggests that some patients from multicultural groups prefer to seek care from providers of their own race, ethnicity, or language group, and that such concordance ap\u00ad peared to have a positive impact on appropriate service utilization, treatment participation, and receipt of some services. However, the literature on the effects of positive outcomes in utilization was not shown to translate into improvements in health outcomes. Many health care organizations and policymakers have pursued diversification of the workforce as a way of increasing patient-provider concordance, although others are skeptical, given the demographic difficulties of achieving this goal across-the-board. Neverthe\u00ad less, ongoing research in this area can also be of considerable value for what it illuminates about cross- cultural health care encounters. Key research questions focus on: Concordance and the clinical encounter (e.g., what can we learn from concordant encounters about factors that could be emulated in non-concordant encounters?) SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 11 PART ONE: OVERVIEW Patient-related health care delivery and health outcomes (e.g., does concordance affect patient/ consumer comprehension, satisfaction, appropriate utilization of services, adherence to treat\u00ad ment, perceived health status and/or quality of life measures?) Clinician-related outcomes (e.g., does concordance have an effect on clinician behavior/per\u00adceptions? Measures could include time spent with patients/consumers, number of treatment options discussed, level of interaction, number of questions the patient is allowed to ask, negotia\u00adtion of treatment options, clinician perceptions of effectiveness of his/her efforts.) The impact of concordance on organizations (e.g., does the overall level of staff awareness and sensitivity to cultural issues improve when there is diversity throughout the organization?) Community Health Workers and Culturally Competent Health Promotion Both these topics have already been extensively researched, although not necessarily with a specific focus on the effect of the culturally competent aspect of the interventions. Studies suggest linkages between the intervention and increases in health-care-related knowledge, self-care practices, screening rates, and de\u00ad creases in risk behaviors. Both types of interventions could benefit from further research in the following areas: What is the impact on knowledge, behavioral change, and/or health outcomes of community health workers (CHW) and culturally competent health promotion (CCHP) programs versus standard interventions? Versus no intervention? Is there a significant improvement in health care delivery and/or health outcomes when the intervention is highly tailored to subgroups and subcultures as opposed to generalized culturally competent health promotion programs? Which elements of the culturally sensitive methods utilized by CHW and CCHP programs improve access, quality and utilization of services? Category B: Language Assistance Language Barriers, Bilingual Services, Oral Interpretation, and Translated Written Materials The literature on the impact of language barriers and language assistance interventions is both substantial and promising with respect to outcomes. Studies show that language barriers have a demonstrable negative impact on communication, satisfaction, and appropriate health care utilization. A growing body of literature suggests that language assistance interventions such as oral interpretation can have a positive effect on patient satisfaction and comprehension, and improvements on health care delivery measures such as in\u00ad creases in the amount of time spent with patients, reduction in diagnostic testing disparities among English- speaking patients versus limited English proficient (LEP) patients, higher clinic return rates, and increases in primary care services utilization. The Research Agenda on this topic is divided into four areas around which to structure future research efforts on language assistance: Impact research (e.g., what is the impact of untrained interpreters versus trained interpreters on different outcomes?) 12 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART ONE: OVERVIEW Cost-related research (e.g., what are the cost-benefits of different types of language assistance services and of not providing interpreter services?) Organizational research (e.g., what are the human resource management considerations, in\u00adcluding cost, involved in using bilingual staff who have other responsibilities as ad hoc interpret\u00ad ers?) Translation and miscellaneous topics (e.g., do translated prescription instructions lead to fewer patient medication errors and/or better adherence?) Category C: Organizational Supports for Cultural Competence The research agenda identifies eight types of organizational supports for cultural competence. These are primarily management activities not expected to have a direct impact on health outcomes, but intended to improve health care delivery to culturally diverse populations. To date, both descriptive and process-related outcomes research on these activities is very limited. How\u00ad ever, a number of research questions were identified that would better define these interventions and inves\u00ad tigate potential links between them and improved organizational efficiency. They include research related to: Management, policy and implementation strategies to institutionalize cultural competence activi\u00ad ties (e.g., does the existence of explicit plans and strategies for the implementation of cultural competence interventions facilitate and improve the delivery of those services over an ad hoc approach?) Community involvement in CLAS program planning, design, implementation, governance, train\u00ading, and research (e.g., does having ethnic community advisory committees or other mecha\u00adnisms of community input have a measurable and beneficial effect on the successful implemen\u00ad tation and acceptance of plans, policies, and programs of culturally competent interventions, either at the organizational or programmatic level?) Design and use of surveys and profile instruments to plan for services and measure satisfaction, quality of services (e.g., what level of community input, data gathering and testing is necessary to develop culturally valid tools for information gathering, as many health care organizations have neither the time nor resources to engage in complex survey development processes for the purposes of service planning and design? Are there model instruments or templates that can be easily adapted? What are the benefits of the process of involving the community in survey design, above and beyond implementing an acceptable tool?) Cultural competence self assessments (e.g., what impact does the implementation of organiza\u00adtional self-assessments have on motivating improvements on cultural competence within the organization, and overall organizational strategic planning?) Ethnic data collection/community profiles (e.g., does the easy availability of race/ethnicity/lan\u00ad guage data improve the timely delivery of culturally competent services, such as insuring an interpreter is present for appointments, sending materials in the appropriate language, or assign\u00ading enrollees to a concordant clinician if the enrollee doesn't select a clinician?) SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 13 PART ONE: INTRODUCTION Summary of Methodological and Practical Considerations While there is a high level of interest in the results of research on cultural competence interventions, the RAC identified several methodological challenges to conducting such research. These include lack of: Standardized definitions of the interventions Standardized evaluative measures Culturally competent instruments Secondary data sources with uniform racial, ethnic, and language data. An additional challenge is the large sample size that is required to prove that cultural competence interven\u00adtions are more effective than similar interventions that are not designed to be culturally competent. The RAC also identified various factors that impede the funding and publication of cultural competence research. RAC members thought that funders and journal reviewers tended to lack familiarity with the impact of language and culture on health care delivery and viewed cultural competence research as mar\u00adginal and/or high risk. This was thought to make some funders unwilling to expend the amounts of money necessary to show linkages between cultural competence interventions and health outcomes, and journals unwilling to accept manuscripts. Researchers, in turn, may therefore consider cultural competence studies to be a high risk undertaking. These challenges, as well as the RAC's suggestions for addressing them, are discussed in further detail in Part Three of this report. 14 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE Part Two CULTURAL COMPETENCE RESEARCH AGENDAS PART TWO: OVERVIEW I.

C ATEGORY A: C ULTURALLY SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS Research Agenda on Cultural Competence Education and Training Definition Cultural competence education and training broadly describes a vast array of educational activities aimed at enhancing the capacity of the individuals and the service delivery system to meet the needs of different racial and ethnic populations (hereinafter referred to as cultural competence training). The litera\u00ad ture suggests that cultural competence training can include educational activities aimed at increasing sensi\u00ad tivity and awareness; the provision of multicultural health and demographic information on service area populations; skills building in bicultural and bilingual interviewing and patient assessment; enhancing the use of race or ethnic-specific epidemiological data in diagnosis and treatment; and increasing cultural knowledge and understanding. Training can be designed for individuals in clinical, support, administrative, and gover\u00adnance positions. It is believed that the knowledge and skills gained through training will enable providers and institutions to work more effectively in cross-cultural situations by developing new approaches to communi\u00ad cation, patient care, and services planning that are based on cultural and linguistic needs. Synthesis of Findings from Literature Review The literature findings on education and training can be separated into three groupings: descriptive studies, the impact of education and training on participants, and the impact of education and training on patients. Descriptive Studies The majority of the literature encompasses descriptive studies of cultural competency training, delivery approaches and techniques; arguments for using training as a means to eliminate disparities; and surveys of the prevalence of training in different educational settings. The literature focuses primarily on cultural com\u00ad petence training in the context of formal educational programs or post-graduate residency training for health professions. Additional work is needed on the prevalence and format of training in workplace-based training or continuing education for practicing professionals. The content of training described in these studies varies widely. Findings suggest that additional research is needed to determine whether the standardization of cultural competence education is appropriate and effective, how established goals and objectives can be empirically measured, and the best approaches for attaining health care delivery and health outcomes. Impact of Education and Training on Participants Most of the remaining literature attempts to answer questions related to the impact of training on training participants. In an attempt to quantify the impact of training on participants, studies examined levels of cultural knowledge, attitudes, awareness, satisfaction and communication skills overall. Studies that empiri\u00ad cally measured the impact of training found that self-assessments indicated significant increases in levels of cultural knowledge, attitudes and awareness in both single and comparative groups. However, some studies using non-subjective measures found that knowledge improved in a few areas but not others. Other studies documented modest improvements in some attitudes, but few improvements in communication skills. Studies that examined the impact of training on sensitivity generated inconclusive and often contradictory results. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 19 PART TWO: EDUCATION AND TRAINING Several comparative studies attempted to determine the impact and effectiveness of variations in training presentation and content. These studies reported different levels of improvement in knowledge, awareness, and cultural sensitivity, frequently relying on self-report assessments rather than objective behavioral as\u00ad sessments. However, other studies found no empirically measured differences. Impact of Education and Training on Patients Very few studies examined the impact of training on patient behavior change or on health care delivery and health outcomes. There is a need to define which are the most desirable outcomes related to the patient- provider relationship, and which are the most reliable indicators of positive improvements that could result from training. One interesting study, which may provide a model for future research, attempted to measure the impact of training from the perspective of the patient using both subjective and objective measurements. It found that clients assigned to experienced counselors who received cultural sensitivity training rated their counselor higher on credibility and relationship measures, returned for more follow-up sessions, and ex\u00ad pressed greater satisfaction with counseling than did clients assigned to experienced counselors who had not received the additional training. Research activities currently underway by others will attempt to assess the impact of cultural competence training on measures of competency, patient trust and satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and subsequent health care delivery and health outcomes. Key Research Questions The literature on cultural competency education and training made the assumption that positive impacts on training participants will result in behavioral changes that will facilitate the delivery of culturally competent care. It is also assumed that these changes will eventually translate into improvements in health care deliv\u00ad ery and health outcomes, including satisfaction. Clearly there is a need to examine and validate each of these assumptions, including an examination of the types of education that have the most effective impact on subsequent outcomes. Trainees and Motivation Should all management, clinical, and support staff, as well as those being educated to assume those positions, receive cultural competency training? Is the likelihood of better health care delivery and patient health outcomes (including improved satisfaction) sufficient to motivate attendance, or must there be additional incentives (financial or otherwise)? How big does the perceived payoff (including incentives) have to be for trainees to be willing to expend time and energy in cultural competence training? Is it sufficiently motivating to learn more effective communication skills, or must clinicians be persuaded by scientific/empirical evidence that demonstrates better health care delivery and patient health outcomes from training? Do motivations differ by ethnicity of the trainee, or different practice settings (e.g., solo prac\u00adtice, patient populations of different socio-economic status, public versus private, clinic versus non-clinic)? Is there a threshold of the number of patients of a different ethnicity or multiple ethnicities that contributes to the motivation? 20 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: EDUCATION AND TRAINING Content of Training Which competencies and basic skills produce behavioral changes by trainees and improvement in health care delivery and health outcomes? How should curricula be tailored to address the needs of individual disciplines and/or educa\u00ad tional settings? Which aspects of training can be generic in content, and which aspects should focus on specific cultures or ethnic groups? Can education on cultural issues translate into changes in behavior and service delivery in the absence of skills training? How can the danger of reinforcing negative perceptions and attitudes be minimized? How do curricula designers best gather and incorporate information on how clients want to be treated in health care encounters (which may vary by ethnicity)? How can organizations best monitor and revise their curricula to respond to changes in the demographics of an institution's service population? Form of Training Which educational delivery techniques (e.g., mentored clinical contacts, videotaped consulta\u00ad tions, student log-books, community medicine projects, affective methods, and didactic meth\u00ad ods) are most effective at changing trainee behavior? Does training have to be tailored to different groups of trainees (e.g., management, clinical, and support staff) to achieve better results than undifferentiated training? What is the impact of format, content, and length of training? Is there any measurable, long-term effect of one-time training interventions? Achieving Behavioral Changes Among Trainees Which methods are most reliable for assessing the impact of training on knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and skills? Do the effects of training vary among different types of trainees (e.g., students, practicing clinicians, non-clinical staff, various disciplines)? What degree of knowledge or awareness translates into action? Is there a dose-response rela\u00adtionship for certain training interventions, and what is the minimum intervention that will result in acceptable outcomes? How can behavioral changes be sustained? Are there outcome differences associated with individuals who have a prior interest in cultural issues, or who have very diverse client profiles? Can variations in provider behavior be attributed to a certain level of knowledge, awareness or sensitivity? SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 21 PART TWO: EDUCATION AND TRAINING Impact Research What is the impact of the training on health care delivery and health outcomes, and which outcomes are the most appropriate to measure? Possibilities include: Adherence to treatment recommendations Keeping recommended follow-up visits Appropriate utilization of primary and emergency services Less restrictive placements Patient satisfaction Diagnostic success Morbidity measures such as exercise tolerance for cardiac patients, missed days of school/ work for asthmatics, hemoglobin A1C for diabetics, etc. Methodological and/or Policy Considerations Influencing Future Research Variations in studies highlight a fundamental problem with the myriad definitions of training: since there is no universal standard for training, nor a standard definition of cultural competence, there can be no comparabil\u00ad ity among existing studies of the \"cultural competence\" of subjects participating in different training pro\u00adgrams. This further supports the need for a more thorough examination of the types of competencies needed in various disciplines and educational settings, and the setting of standards of training for different target audiences. Methodological problems associated with assessing the impact of cultural competence training include rely\u00ad ing on subjective self-assessment of cultural competence, knowledge and awareness. Some use indepen\u00addently developed assessment tools, others use tools designed for use with training curricula. Many rely on knowledge-based tests rather than observations of behavior and subsequent change. This may present a false sense of security on the part of individuals who are able to absorb facts and theorize easily, but have difficulty putting them into practice, while falsely validating specific training modules. Subjective self-assess\u00ad ments should be augmented with objective assessments of cultural knowledge, and client assessments (sat\u00ad isfaction, grievances, etc.) tied to individual clinicians. Future research should consider examining the impact of training on providers and their clients. Many of the studies examining training involved students, not providers, and therefore changes in behavior or service delivery could not be assessed. Training for individuals in support, administrative and governance positions should also be evaluated for impact on day-to-day staff-client interactions, as well as on sensitivity and responsiveness to cultural/linguistic issues in health services planning. 22 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: EDUCATION AND TRAINING As with other types of training geared towards trainee behavior change, critical questions arise related to the difficulty of establishing firm linkages between cultural competence training and subsequent trainee behav\u00ad ior and/or impacts on health care delivery and health outcomes. These may include the following: Can we isolate the impact of training from inherent skill, personality, and other intangibles? How do we measure and evaluate the impact of training on health care delivery and health outcomes? Is it reasonable to expect evidence of training's ability to improve health outcomes, or should training only be held accountable for achieving intermediary effects, such as improving commu\u00ad nication? Stakeholders should be aware that most training topics or modules regularly undertaken by health care professionals have not been definitively linked with subsequent outcome improvements, and this linkage (or lack thereof) is not taken as an indicator of value. Many RAC members felt that cultural competence training should not be held to a higher standard. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 23 PART TWO: RACIAL, ETHNIC , AND LINGUISTIC CONCORDANCE Research Agenda on Racial, Ethnic, and Linguistic Concordance Definition Racial, ethnic, and linguistic concordance refers to the process of matching any or all such characteris\u00ad tics between patients/consumers and clinicians. The underlying assumption behind this process is that com\u00ad monality with respect to these characteristics will lead to a higher degree of rapport between participants in a clinical encounter by eliminating differences in cultural and linguistic backgrounds that lead to misunder\u00adstandings, leading to a positive impact on outcomes. Some literature suggests that concordance may be relevant beyond the clinical encounter to encompass race/ethnic/language-specific clinic sites or programs. It is theorized that successful delivery of health ser\u00ad vices to different racial and ethnic populations requires an understanding of the cultural milieu of each distinct community, as well as the trust of communities and individual patients. This understanding and trust can be obtained by instituting service and support staffing patterns that mirror the targeted service popula\u00ad tion. Incorporating a team that reflects the community dynamics can instill this assurance and assist in the development of culturally appropriate and acceptable care essential to a successful program. Synthesis of Findings from Literature Review The literature suggests that some patients from multicultural groups prefer to seek care from providers of their own race, ethnicity, or language group, and that such concordances appeared to have a positive impact on appropriate service utilization, treatment participation, and receipt of some services, although impact on satisfaction was inconclusive. The literature on the effects of positive outcomes in utilization was not shown to translate into improvements in health outcomes. Research was conducted with Asian, Hispanic, and black concordant encounters, but findings should be considered specific to the groups studied, and not generaliz\u00ad able across ethnic groups. Research currently pending publication on the relationship between patient\u00adcenteredness and race-concordant visits suggests that patient and physician age and gender are significant confounders in the relationship between race-concordance and communication styles. The literature particularly appears to support the benefits of language-concordant encounters, showing that language concordance between patients and providers eliminates many of the problems associated with language barriers. However, further research should examine the differential impact of concordant encoun\u00ad ters with those using interpreters. Key Research Questions Concordance and the Clinical Encounter What specifically is important about concordance in medical encounters: is it race, ethnicity, gender, age, socioeconomic status, culture, language, and/or communication style(s)? What can we learn from concordant encounters about the factors that could be emulated in non-concordant encounters? Which factors are not definable or replicable? Are there factors that are common across racial/ethnic/language groups, or does each cultural group respond to their own unique factors? Can greater satisfaction, or other health care delivery and health outcomes be affected by clinician non-race/ethnic factors, such as a patient-centered provider approach, age or gender? How does this combine with concordance factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, age, SES, culture, language, patient-centeredness, and/or communication styles? 24 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: RACIAL , ETHNIC , AND LINGUISTIC CONCORDANCE Do matches on exact cultures (as opposed to, for example, language groups or regions) yield better health care delivery and health outcomes? How precise do matches have to be in order to have an impact on outcomes? At what level is concordance most productive? For example, is there greater positive impact on intermediate outcomes for concordance between broad group\u00adings, using categories such as Hispanic or Latino, or for more specific concordance (e.g., Puerto Rican providers with Puerto Rican patients)? What portion of the change in the outcome can be attributed to differences in gender, age or level of acculturation within these concordant catego\u00adries? Do findings related to health care delivery and health outcomes in concordant encounters vary by different racial, ethnic or linguistic groups? For example, would recently-arrived Bosnian refugees in concordant encounters show more positive outcomes than third generation, English- speaking Latinos? Is there a variable impact related to the effects of: length of time in this country, acculturation, educational level, religious and gender matching, experience of war/ trauma/torture? Which variables are most relevant when there are multiple variables, and should they be tracked separately? Patient-related Health Care Delivery and Health Outcomes Does concordance affect patient/consumer: comprehension, satisfaction, appropriate utilization of services, and adherence to treatment, perceived health status and/or quality of life measures? Do positive outcomes in any of these areas correlate to medical condition/health status improve\u00ad ments? Does a lack of choice of concordant providers have an impact on overall health service utiliza\u00ad tion or satisfaction with a health care system or plan? Does a lack of concordant support staff affect perceptions of a system or plan, service utiliza\u00ad tion, or satisfaction? Does the impact of concordance change over time? Is the need for concordance greater at the beginning of clinical/organizational relationships as a means to establish trust? Clinician-related Outcomes Does concordance have an effect on clinician behavior/perceptions? Measures could include time spent with patients/consumers, number of treatment options discussed, level of interaction, number of questions the patient is allowed to ask, negotiation of treatment options, clinician perceptions of effectiveness of his/her efforts. How does the health care delivery and health outcomes of concordant encounters compare with those for clinicians who have received cul\u00ad tural competence training? What factors and behaviors can be found in both types of encoun\u00adters and which are not replicable? What is the effectiveness of cross-cultural training to make generally concordant pairs more effective? (e.g., programs to expose African-American providers to Caribbean health beliefs and practices? What effect might cross-cultural training have on the attitudes and communica\u00ad tion practices of the clinicians who participate?) SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 25 PART TWO: RACIAL, ETHNIC , AND LINGUISTIC CONCORDANCE The Impact of Concordance on Organizations What are the broader implications of concordance outside of the medical encounter, particularly the systemic implications? Is it simply a \"wallpaper\" effect\u2014 that the visual evidence of diver\u00ad sity is reassuring to patients. Does concordance achieved through a diverse staff improve the service design and delivery efforts targeting multicultural communities? Does the overall level of staff awareness and sensitivity to cultural issues improve when there is diversity throughout the organization? What mechanisms exist in the organization to facilitate communication and learning among staff and across the organization? Does tension arise among staff from efforts to diversify staffing to achieve concordance? What are the repercussions of such efforts, and what impact does this have on the delivery of cultur\u00ad ally competent services? Methodological and/or Policy Considerations Influencing Future Research RAC members identified difficulties recruiting ethnic minority clinicians into this kind of research. The main reasons for recruitment difficulties appear to be related to lack of time, lack of financial incentives, and lack of perceived benefit to the providers themselves. However, the recent positive findings related to racial concordance have led some providers to become more willing to participate. Studies that collect data using direct observation, such as through audiotape and videotape, and other quali\u00ad tative methods (e.g., focus groups, in-depth interviews, transcripts of actual encounters) might shed more light on the relationship of clinician and patient perceptions of one another to race and ethnic concordance. RAC members disagreed about the potential applications of provider-patient concordance. The majority of participants expressed uncertainty about the implications of pursuing concordance as a policy or organiza\u00ad tional goal. Such a goal is probably unachievable on a national scale for the foreseeable future, given the current demographics of health professionals in practice and in training. However, current research sug\u00adgests that patients perceive and experience positive benefits from concordant encounters, suggesting an adequate rationale for providers to pursue this strategy as an organizational goal when reasonably achiev\u00ad able. Aside from outcomes considerations, further research on the dynamics of concordant encounters and eth\u00ad nic-specific clinics and programs could be very helpful in improving non-concordant encounters through program design and staff training. Continued research can assist with better understanding the factors about discordance that are dissatisfying to patients. It can inform practitioners in discordant relationships what they should be wary of or address differently, thus increasing the possibility that they can establish patient trust and comfort early in the clinical relationship. 26 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS Research Agenda on Community Health Workers Definition Community health workers (CHWs) are typically members of a particular community whose task it is to assist in improving the health of that community in cooperation with the health care system or public health agencies. The literature suggests that CHWs can work as agents of change by providing a variety of services, including outreach to underserved and hard-to-reach populations; health promotion/disease pre\u00ad vention educational instruction; patient tracking, needs assessment and the provision of follow-up services; patient advocacy and assistance; and, in some instances, delivering limited health care services. Although many of these services are capable of being delivered through a direct systems-based approach, CHWs are often trained to integrate a more culturally and linguistically sensitive approach in a community setting. In addition to being part of the existing community and social network, CHWs ideally possess certain skills and capacities that are essential to gaining the trust and acceptance of individuals. These may include cultural communication and mediation skills, an understanding of the community's health belief systems and knowledge of a community's strengths and capacities, and the ability to use effective approaches for reach\u00ad ing targeted individuals. Through an integrated approach, CHWs can theoretically facilitate a better under\u00adstanding of the changes that are sought without threatening the interests or cultural values of the community. In addition to influencing health-related behavioral change and health outcomes in targeted communities, CHWs can also assist systems and service providers by soliciting information on community barriers, pat\u00ad terns of social interaction and decision making, past efforts aimed at changing health behaviors, and associ\u00ad ated successes and failures. This information can enable providers and institutions to adopt methods more acceptable to the targeted community. Synthesis of Findings from Literature Review Descriptive There is a sufficient literature base that describes the use of community health workers/lay health advisors, the content and structure of CHW-assisted programs, and the methodologies by which CHWs were inte\u00ad grated into specific programs as part of a corrective strategy to supplement or modify existing initiatives. The literature highlights variations in training and preparation, roles and responsibilities, and controversies associated with using CHWs. This literature can provide the foundation for further meta-analysis related to the utility of CHWs, core competencies, associated data collection, institutional and structural barriers to using CHWs, and potential models for duplication. This base can be used to identify those cultural components that make the work of CHWs more effective in meeting community-based needs. Impact Research Literature that empirically measures the impact of CHWs is limited, and surveys conducted by other institu\u00adtions validate this finding for both published and non-published sources. Studies that attempted to quantify the impact of CHWs on various health care delivery and health outcomes looked at the effect of CHWs on patient satisfaction, knowledge, service utilization, and health status. No studies were identified that exam\u00adined the cost effectiveness or cost benefits of using CHWs. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 27 PART TWO: COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS Findings suggest: CHWs were effective in increasing health-related knowledge and self-care practices through educational instruction. They were also credited with higher rates of health promotion course completion. CHWs facilitated behavioral change in the target population by providing encouragement, sup\u00adport and serving as role models. Increases in screening rates were attributed directly to their use in several studies. CHWs were effective in decreasing high-risk behaviors in the target population. Enhanced case management tracking and monitoring of patients by CHWs resulted in better follow-up with medical care. The use of CHWs was highly valued by administrators, program staff and clients. Virtually no studies linked CHWs directly to health outcomes, and those that did often did not compare the use of CHWs to no intervention. Key Research Questions What are the specific roles and responsibilities of CHWs? How are interventions delivered by CHWs? What are effective strategies for partnerships between CHWs and health care organizations? Are credentialed CHWs more effective than non-credentialed CHWs? What are the indicators or standards for successful CHW programs? What is the most effective use of CHWs? What proportion of the targeted population is successfully reached by CHWs? Do variations exist in levels of successful outreach when using CHWs as an intervention versus other methods of outreach (i.e. case management)? What institutional barriers prevent the use of CHWs? How have these barriers been over\u00adcome? Is the use of CHWs a cost effective alternative to other comparable interventions when you include stakeholders' valuations? Is it appropriate to use cost as a measure of success? How can the effectiveness of CHWs be improved? Which components of the CHW's role impact behavioral change? Of these behavioral changes, which can be linked to improvements in health care delivery and health outcomes? Is it realistic to link CHWs to health outcomes? 28 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS Methodological and/or Policy Considerations Influencing Future Research The RAC highlighted methodological concerns that could affect future research efforts. These include: The difficulty of standardizing relationships between CHWs and their clients. The literature describes CHWs as having a very dedicated advocacy role and an individualized approach that differs from worker to worker. The relationships that CHWs form with individuals in the target population, and even client to client, often cannot be individually standardized, but researchers and program directors can outline the content of patient instruction/interaction, as well as pro\u00ad cesses to develop relationships and trust that can be standardized and measured. Data collection on CHWs and their clients is not standardized and often more qualitative, thereby hampering comparative analyses. Length of study, compounded by a lack of personnel and financial resources, will be barriers to conducting health care delivery and health outcomes research or any ongoing monitoring of behavioral changes. Difficulties reaching populations, high attrition and the mobility of populations compound diffi\u00ad culties in long-term studies. Ambiguous definitions of \"community.\" Systems often mistakenly assume that a community is an aggregation of individuals of a similar race, ethnicity, language or geographic locale, and do not take into consideration social and organizational factors that links individuals to a specific community. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 29 PART TWO: CULTURALLY COMPETENT HEALTH PROMOTION Research Agenda on Culturally Competent Health Promotion Definition Health promotion refers to the process by which individuals, communities and populations are given the tools necessary to improve health care delivery and health outcomes. Culturally competent health promotion (CCHP) implies the incorporation of culturally sensitive concepts and practices into health promotion activi\u00ad ties. Developing CCHP policies and interventions entails the integration of a multilevel community organiza\u00ad tion and development approach. Activities associated with this approach include community input into the design, implementation and evaluation of programs and associated activities; a comprehensive understand\u00ading of the health issues and needs of the target population; and the provision of health information and education. When conducted with a high degree of cultural and linguistic specificity, it is hypothesized that these interventions can be more effective in improving outcomes. Synthesis of Findings from Literature Review The literature suggests that culturally competent health promotion consists of a variety of approaches aimed at improving health care delivery and health outcomes by promoting healthy behaviors, early detection and treatment of disease, and care of chronic disease. The programs examined used individual culturally and linguistically sensitive interventions, or several interventions in combination, to improve outcomes. These include community input in the planning process, multicultural providers, racial/ethnic concordance, tradi\u00ad tional healers, lay health workers, community health workers, public health campaigns, translated materials or culturally sensitive material, interpreters, multilingual informational videotapes and cultural competence training. Due to the number of interventions that can be used to define CCHP programs, the amount of descriptive literature highlighting the design, methods and processes of such programs is tremendous. Although limited, studies that empirically measured the impact of CCHP programs on outcomes examined satisfaction, service utilization (e.g., impact on screening rates), increases in health knowledge, changes in health behavior and practices, and prevention. Findings suggest that some of the individual interventions associated with CCHP programs were found to have added value while others had inconsistent results. Community health workers were found to have a successful impact on recruitment into screening and health education programs and assisted in the facilitation of program completion. (For more details, see the Re\u00ad search Agenda on Community Health Workers.) Several studies attempted to measure both knowledge and behavioral change as a result of program participation. While some studies indicated increases in both measures, others found that increases in knowledge could not be linked to behavioral changes. Another study revealed that the impact of one CCHP program on different racial and ethnic study populations revealed different results for different ethnic groups. In those studies that reported positive results on intermediary outcomes, no scientific links could be made to improvements in health outcomes. However, it was theorized by some authors that subsequent changes in health status could be attributed to the positive impact of these interventions. The literature also revealed gaps or weaknesses in methodological design when examining the impact of CCHP programs and associated interventions on health outcomes. Very few studies were identified that specifically document improvements in health outcomes as a result of integrating culturally sensitive inter\u00ad ventions into the delivery approach. Although comparison studies were conducted between CCHP and other case management approaches, no highly controlled designs examining the impact of culturally sensi\u00ad tive program intervention versus a standard health promotion program were identified, thereby weakening the findings of those studies that did report positive improvements in health outcomes. 30 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: CULTURALLY COMPETENT HEALTH PROMOTION Key Research Questions What is the impact of culturally competent health promotion programs versus standard health promotion programs on knowledge, behavioral change, and health outcomes? What are some of the indirect benefits of CCHP (e.g., greater family involvement and support in the care of patients)? Is there a significant improvement in health care delivery and health outcomes when the inter\u00ad vention is highly tailored to subgroups and subcultures as opposed to generalized culturally competent health promotion programs? What methods are effective for incorporating community input into the design, implementation, and evaluation of CCHP activities? Which elements of the culturally sensitive methods utilized by CCHP programs improve access, quality and utilization of services? Methodological and/or Policy Considerations Influencing Future Research The Research Advisory Committee (RAC) expressed concern about future research efforts directed at assessing the impact of culturally competent health promotion interventions. Many felt that breaking up a multi-component culturally competent health promotion program into discreet elements for the purposes of evaluation (e.g., the impact of interpretation, family inclusion, or lay health workers) would result in a dilutional effect of the overall intervention, and determining the impact of these elements may not be possible. The RAC also suggested that research assessing the impact of CCHP efforts may need to be conducted on specifically targeted cultural groups and subcultures, and success may need to be defined as it relates to the targeted populations. Concern was also expressed regarding the availability of theoretical models, and lack of instruments and methodologies to measure and validate CCHP elements. Suggestions were made to include both quantita\u00ad tive and qualitative approaches in the assessment of culturally sensitive interventions. Future efforts should focus on appropriately controlled experiments measuring the impact between standard programs and culturally competent programs in addition to attempting to measure the impact of the interven\u00adtion compared to no intervention. However, detection of the marginal benefits of CCHP over health promo\u00ad tion interventions that were not specifically culturally competent would prove difficult without extremely large sample sizes due to the modest size of the expected effect. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 31 PART TWO: FAMILY/COMMUNITY INCLUSION Research Agenda on Family/Community Inclusion in Health Care Delivery Definition Family/community inclusion refers to the participation of family members or community-based networks in the development, implementation and decision-making processes of health care delivery. The underlying assumption supporting inclusion is that, through greater participation, family members and community-based networks can act as agents of change to facilitate improved social, behavioral and health outcomes more effectively than an exclusively health care system-based approach. Through the process of inclusion, essen\u00adtial cultural issues affecting service delivery and utilization can be identified by families and/or communities, and integrated into more responsive health care. Synthesis of Findings from Literature Review Research on the impact of family/community inclusion examined two distinct activities: inclusion of family/ community in clinical encounters, and community involvement in the planning, design and implementation of programs and research. Studies described a variety of mechanisms for involving community members in the development of different organizational supports for culturally competent activities such as clinical training, survey design, health promotion program design, and developing community profiles. The authors of these studies theorize that family/community inclusion: Increased screening rates. Assisted medical providers in overcoming challenges in caring for elder patients. Positively influenced the participation of individuals in training programs. Assured the cultural acceptability of research tools leading to higher response rates and in\u00adcreased access to information about the community. However, it should be noted that none of these studies used experimental research to measure the impact of inclusion on health care delivery and health outcomes or community-based participation. Therefore, further studies are needed to validate these findings. Key Research Questions The RAC suggested a need to further define and isolate specific aspects of both family inclusion and community participation that may improve care, and to identify models that warrant replication. Before inclusion can be justified as an intervention, efforts need to be made to understand the mechanisms of family and community involvement, how these mechanisms subsequently impact health encounters and practices, and whether the effects of inclusion can be isolated from other confounding variables in order to be linked to measurable outcomes. Characteristics of Family Inclusion in the Health Care Encounter What methods can be used to determine whether inclusion is appropriate in a particular medical encounter, to what extent, and in what capacity should family members be involved? What positive and negative elements of provider-patient-family interaction can be identified? 32 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: FAMILY/COMMUNITY INCLUSION What is the best way to teach providers to facilitate the inclusion of all parties without over\u00ad extending the encounter period? What impact does family inclusion have on the amount of clinically/psycho-socially relevant information exchanged between the patient/family and the clinician, retention of information from a health encounter, satisfaction with the encounter/clinician, adherence to recommended treatment, and outcomes of conditions that could benefit from social support (e.g., chronic disease management, consistent prenatal care, weight loss)? Other possible outcomes include improved patient satisfaction, improved family satisfaction, and increased likelihood that patient desires regarding level and type of intervention are adhered to. Community Involvement in Health Care Planning and Delivery (For further discussion of this issue, see Category C: Research Agenda on Organizational Supports) Questions related to community involvement are aimed at isolating those characteristics of community that may have an impact on health care delivery and health outcomes, and community involvement as an inter\u00ad vention. Desirable outcomes might include more community support for individuals or families during illness, routine involvement of the community program design and delivery, greater community acceptability and utilization of health programs, and greater satisfaction with health programs. Which characteristics of community support or facilitate positive social and behavioral out\u00adcomes in health programs? Who are the appropriate representatives to involve? What level of involvement should be sought, at what points in the process, and over what period of time? Do specific attributes or mechanisms of community involvement have a measurable effect on desired health care delivery and health outcomes? How can the impact of community involvement on health care delivery and health outcomes be measured? Are different measures appropriate for different communities? What skills are needed by health planners and providers to successfully solicit community input and integrate that input into health planning and delivery? Methodological and/or Policy Considerations Influencing Future Research It may be difficult to manage and account for some of the complex variables that arise when looking at the impact of family and community on health care delivery and health outcomes. For example, conflict between patients and family, multiple community stakeholders with differing perspectives or agendas, and other psychosocial dynamics may confound results. The definitions of a successful outcome may also vary by stakeholder group Research involving community collaboration or participation often requires more time than other types of health services research because time must be spent in relationship building and negotiating the needs/ opinions of health care planners and community members. Grants should take this into account and funding agencies should provide more protected time and overall project time for this type of research. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 33 PART TWO: TRADITIONAL PRACTICES /HEALERS Research Agenda on Coordination of Conventional Medicine and Traditional Practices/Healers Definition Coordination of conventional medicine and traditional practices/healers refers to the blending of Western medicine with that of other cultures. In many ethnic communities, health status, disease causality and health care treatment may be defined or explained through traditional or folk models. These models differ from Western biomedical explanations in that illness could be caused by injuries, environmental factors, or inter\u00ad personal conflicts; attributed to witchcraft, sorcery, spirits; or result from violating cultural, religious, spiritual or traditional norms. Responses can differ from that of conventional medicine, resulting in the use of tradi\u00ad tional practices/remedies such as herbal remedies, acupuncture, massage, and prayer rituals; and /or consul\u00ad tation with traditional healers or practitioners. For some, the use of traditional practices/healers may be the first and only approach to dealing with health-related concerns, while others may feel that coordination of both traditional and conventional approaches is beneficial. Understanding these alternative models may help to uncover potential barriers to service delivery while providing the opportunity to integrate specific compo\u00adnents into conventional practice. Synthesis of Findings from Literature Review An extensive amount of literature was identified that describes alternative diagnostic/prevention methods, traditional healing practices utilized by individuals, and the use of traditional healers. These descriptive articles argue persuasively that culturally competent care should attempt to coordinate components of alter\u00ad native systems and practices with conventional approaches to care. The majority of literature examining the impact of traditional practices/healers is process related; very little research was identified that measured the impact of the interventions on health care delivery and health outcomes. Several studies examined issues such as motivation for seeking care, frequency of use, whether traditional practices were used in conjunction with conventional services, and level of awareness and knowl\u00adedge regarding alternative methods. Findings from these studies suggest: Traditional healers are consulted for common medical conditions. Using alternative methods in conjunction with conventional methods can be an effective ap\u00ad proach to avoid conflict between therapies, improve communication between patients and pro\u00ad viders, and to help increase adherence to recommended treatments. Patients are reluctant to inform clinicians and other members of their community about the use of traditional practices/healers for fear of judgment and stigmatization. A few studies describing methods by which traditional healers were integrated into conventional systems of care were identified. These studies detailed how traditional healers were used as consultants in cases involving traditional beliefs and subsequent increases in service utilization were attributed to their use. Key Research Questions How does failure to coordinate/integrate adversely affect patients (e.g., dangerous interaction between conventional and traditional treatments, poor communication, failure to adhere to treat\u00ad ment and/or return for follow-up visits)? 34 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: TRADITIONAL PRACTICES /HEALERS What motivates patients to attempt to integrate traditional practices with conventional medi\u00ad cine? At what point do they make these decisions, and how do they go about coordinating care? How do patients decide whether to share their participation in traditional treatment with conven\u00ad tional clinicians, and how can this sharing be encouraged? How can traditional healers/practices be coordinated with conventional medicine? What models might be appropriate for implementation (e.g., programs for certain conditions vs. others; pro\u00ad grams that coordinate both types of practitioners at one site vs. services coordinated remotely)? Do patients show improvements in certain outcomes (satisfaction, adherence to treatment re\u00ad turn for follow-up visits) when participating in coordinated care vs. conventional care alone? Which approaches to coordinated care have the greatest impact? What types of conflicts arise when attempting to coordinate traditional and conventional treat\u00adments or to be supportive of dual but separate treatment-seeking by patients? What are the most effective resolution processes to mediate conflicts that arise as a result of the use of traditional and conventional practices? What are the concerns of Western clinicians who are reluctant to coordinate or acknowledge the use of traditional practices/healers? What preparation is needed by clinicians and health care organizations to make coordination successful? What information or training helps clinicians and other staff effectively coordinate with tradi\u00adtional healers/practices? Methodological and/or Policy Considerations Influencing Future Research Methodological challenges related to this research include difficulties in: Mounting coordinated/integrated programs to study, due to the challenge of obtaining funding for both research and the demonstration project. Structuring good comparisons (i.e., when coordination does not take place, it is still necessary to quantify traditional use and problems with lack of coordination). Identifying what elements of coordinated programs are responsible for positive results. Being able to generalize beyond one particular model approach or community that is being studied. Researchers should be alert to the need to actively involve ethnic community representatives and/or tradi\u00adtional healers in study design and execution. RAC members also expressed concern that this research focus on the dynamics and outcomes of coordination, and not on testing the \"efficacy\" of traditional treatments or healers. (The NIH National Center on Complementary and Alternative Medicine is looking at efficacy questions related to many traditional practices.) From the practice and policy perspective, what are the implications of supporting/encouraging the use or integration of traditional practices/healers in the absence of funding or reimbursement? Given that some insurers are offering partial coverage of \"alternative\" therapies such as acupuncture and massage therapy, how do providers fairly decide which treatments to cover or offer, lacking studies that conclusively demon\u00ad strate the efficacy of traditional treatments? SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 35 PART TWO: LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE III. C ATEGORY B: L ANGUAGE ASSISTANCE Research Agenda on Language Barriers, Bilingual Services, Oral Interpretation, and Translated Written Materials Definition Language assistance refers to interventions, such as bilingual services, oral interpretation, and translated written materials, to overcome language barriers and improve the quality of health care. While guidance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requires health care providers who receive Federal funds to ensure that language barriers are bridged between limited-English-proficient (LEP) pa\u00adtients and providers, how and whether this is achieved varies considerably. The lack of a widely accepted standard definition for qualified interpreters or a quality standard for translated written materials has implica\u00ad tions for studying the impact of these interventions on health care delivery and health outcomes. (For details about the linguistic interventions described here, please consult the text, commentary, and discussion on CLAS standards 4-7, in the CLAS Standards Report (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Secretary, 2000).) Synthesis of Findings from Literature Review Findings from the literature search can be separated into two themes; studies that analyze or describe the impact of language barriers on outcomes and those that examine the impact of language assistance services on health care delivery and health outcomes. The literature defines language assistance services as the use of bilingual staff communicating directly with patients, the provision of interpretation services through pro\u00ad fessionally trained (or untrained) interpreters, bilingual clinical/support staff, or family members; and the dissemination of translated written materials. Outcomes examined in the literature include patient satisfac\u00ad tion and perceptions of care, patient comprehension, utilization of health services, referrals, adherence, quality of interpretation and patient-provider communication. Impact of Language Barriers on Health Care Delivery and Health Outcomes Studies that examined the impact of language barriers on health and health care have documented the need and importance of providing language assistance services. Language barriers were consistently reported to decrease satisfaction among LEP patients. Research also shows that patients who face language barriers make fewer visits to clinicians and receive fewer preventive services. Studies reported that LEP patients spent less time in the emergency department encounter, were less likely to use or return to clinics, received less testing and prescriptions than English speaking patients, scored lower on health knowledge and had longer hospital stays. LEP participants also noted that testing and medication side-effects were not explained, and studies found that patient understanding of diagnosis and treatment was also affected. Language barriers also contribute to inaccurate communication, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate treatment. Limited English speakers have also been found to receive fewer preventive services, report worse health status, and are less likely to have a regular source of care. These findings support the assumption that language differences create significant barriers to care, and that valuable medical information is not being communicated to or from the provider in the absence of language assistance services, thus compromising access to health care and the quality of the clinical encounter. 36 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE Impact of the Provision of Language Assistance on Health Care The majority of studies measuring the impact of language assistance services assessed impact of interpreter services on outcomes such as: Patient and provider satisfaction with different forms of language assistance services, patient satisfaction with specific health service sites or departments, and satisfaction with level of communication during the clinical encounter Patient's understanding of diagnosis and treatment Utilization of services (emergency, preventive and primary care) Adherence with follow-up appointments Length of stay Duration of health care encounter Number of tests Studies examining the impact of language assistance services on the outcomes listed above report increases in patient satisfaction and a decrease in the number of problems reported in the patient-provider encounter. Findings from these studies also suggest that more highly qualified interpreters (those with training and/or qualifications) had greater impacts, although variations among study designs and intervention characteristics prevent any further generalization of findings. Several studies suggested that improvements in the delivery of care and utilization of services are linked with the use of interpreter services. They reported increases in the amount of time spent with patients, reduction in diagnostic testing disparities among English-speaking patients versus LEP patients, higher clinic return rates, and increases in primary care services utilization. Variations in the number of tests ordered may be attributable to several factors including the use of excessive testing in the absence of quality verbal patient assessment and medical history taking. Studies also reported graded increases in health knowledge with the provision of different types of language assistance services. One study looking at the financial impact of interpreter services reported that non-English speakers incurred higher mean costs for diagnostic testing when language barriers went unaddressed. With the assistance of professional interpreters, no increase in testing costs was noted above a control group of patients who were English-speaking . The Interpretation Process and Translation Additional studies examined the quality and accuracy of various forms of interpretation services and differ\u00adences in mechanisms of delivery. Specifically, these studies examined the use of family members as inter\u00ad preters to determine the quality of interpretation, distortion in interpreter-related messages during clinical evaluations, number of patient-provider utterances and comments, and frequency of errors and satisfaction. This literature documented some problems in interpreter encounters, especially when untrained interpreters are used. One study suggested a reduction in the level of patient-provider communication when using interpreter services, as comments rendered by patients through an interpreter were often ignored by providers. Some studies reported reduced satisfaction, embarrassment and concealment of important information when fam\u00ad ily members or friends interpret, while others describe patient preference for use of a friend or relative. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 37 PART TWO: LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE Another study reported that patients had higher levels of satisfaction with simultaneous remote interpreta\u00ad tion assistance compared to face-to-face consecutive interpretation services. These findings strongly validate the need for additional research, and may reflect the fact that professionally trained interpreters have not been used as the standard in many studies looking at interpretation and quality or satisfaction. Although a formal search of studies on translation was not undertaken, a few studies were identified that examined the complexity of translating/interpreting conventional medical terms into other languages or cul\u00ad tural contexts. This issue has significant implications for a variety of issues, including health literacy and choice of terminology, both orally interpreted and translated. Key Research Questions The Research Advisory Committee (RAC) identified four categorical areas around which to structure future research efforts on language assistance: impact, cost-related, organizational, and translation research questions. Impact Research What is the impact of different language assistance services on communication, patient and provider satisfaction, service utilization (including screenings, type of services provided, diag\u00ad nostic procedures, and treatment), follow-up, adherence, errors, and health outcomes? (This question is intended to examine the effectiveness of different types of language assistance services, e.g., bilingual staff and clinicians, professional interpretation, ad hoc interpretation, remote telephonic and video interpretation.) Does the impact of interpreter services vary across language or culture? Does the acquisition of secondary language skills by health professionals have a desirable and measurable impact on outcomes? What level of proficiency is necessary to conduct basic or complicated medical encounters, and what is the minimal level of training required to reach that proficiency? Is there a differential impact between clinicians who simply have language skills and those who have knowledge of cultural issues as well? Does being a native speaker or coming from the same country of origin make a difference? What is the impact of untrained interpreters versus trained interpreters on different outcomes? If there are differences in quality between these two groups, do they have a measurable impact on intermediate outcomes (e.g., comprehension, adherence)? What is the impact on intermediate outcomes of use of family and friends as interpreters, controlling for language group, patient age, and relationship of the patient to the designated interpreter? What is the impact of gender concordance between interpreter and patient on communication and patient satisfaction, and does this vary by ethnic or religious background? 38 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE Cost-related Research What are the cost-benefits of different types of language assistance services? What are the costs associated with not providing interpreter services? What impact does the existence of language assistance services have on selection of providers or plans by patients, and what are the cost implications of that selection? In what circumstances is it more cost-effective to employee staff interpreters vs. contract interpreters? How do the costs and benefits associated with the provision of language assistance vary across different types of services, institutional settings and geographic locations? Do any differences suggest variable requirements for language assistance? Organizational Research In addition to cost, what other factors affect organizational decisions to use interpreter ser\u00advices? At what points of contact (e.g., nurse advice line, appointment making operations, membership services, health promotion programs, medical office receptionists, clinical encounters) does the provision of language assistance (through bilingual staff persons or interpreter services) make a difference to satisfaction, service utilization, follow-up, communication, adherence, errors, and/ or health outcomes? What are the components of an interpretation services and translation program that improves satisfaction, service utilization, follow-up, communication, adherence, errors, and/or health out\u00ad comes? Are health care staff more inclined to use staff interpreters, bilingual staff, or outside services such as contract interpreters, remote telephonic or video interpretation? What factors influence decision-making in this area? What are the human resource management considerations (including cost) involved in using bilingual staff with other responsibilities as interpreters? Are such staff encouraged or required to be specially trained as interpreters, and what are salary/union contract ramifications? What technology or physical plant considerations are prerequisites to implementing an inter\u00ad preter services program successfully (e.g., telephone wiring in examining rooms, examining rooms large enough to accommodate interpreters)? What methods (verbal and written) of notifying patients of their rights to interpreter services are most effective in increasing utilization of interpreter services? What other factors are behind the reluctance of clinicians to utilize available interpreter re\u00adsources and how can these barriers be overcome? What financial incentives or changes in reimbursement methods can increase utilization of inter\u00ad preter services? What governmental or accreditation policies are most successful in persuading health care providers to provide language assistance for LEP patients? SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 39 PART TWO: LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE Translation and Miscellaneous Research Topics Does translated signage improve patient comfort or ability to move through health care facili\u00ad ties? Do translated written pre-operative instructions lead to decreased rescheduling of procedures because of inappropriate patient preparation? Do translated discharge forms result in a higher rate of attendance at follow-up appointments with either specialists or primary care clinicians? Do translated prescription instructions lead to fewer patient medication errors and/or better adherence? Are verbal (interpreted) instructions more effective than translated written materials for certain patient groups (by age, ethnicity, or education)? Do verbatim translated consent forms vs. summarized consent forms lead to different choices about undertaking high-risk procedures? What are the best approaches for communication of written materials with patients who do not read, or who speak a language without a written form? How critical is it to accommodate regional or dialectic differences in large language groups (e.g., Spanish, Arabic, Chinese)? How do patients respond to occasional word idiosyncrasies? Do patients seek language concordance because they have the choice or because these are the only providers available to them? Do some LEP patients deliberately seek out non-concordant providers and staff based on a perception of higher quality of care? 40 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE Methodological Considerations and Barriers to Conducting Research The RAC felt that the measurement of intermediate outcomes such as communication, patient comprehen\u00ad sion, encounter follow-up and adherence, as well as measurement of satisfaction and subjective determina\u00ad tions of health status, was achievable. However, several methodological challenges may make it difficult for research projects to clearly demonstrate a link between language assistance interventions and health out\u00ad comes. The population that needs language assistance services has a broad range of health care needs (obstetric care, preventive services, acute care, and care for a wide variety of chronic conditions). Research studies conducted using this heterogeneous patient population are the most likely to be generalizable, but it is difficult to find generic measures of health outcomes that are applicable to all patients and sensitive to clinically important changes in health. Thus, these studies may need to rely mostly on intermediate out\u00adcomes. In addition, studies should be conducted among patients with well-defined conditions (e.g., asthma, heart disease). Studies of narrow patient populations are the least likely to be generalizable, but this ap\u00ad proach allows the use of condition-specific health status measures that are more sensitive for detecting clinically important changes in health. There was a strong consensus from the RAC that research in this area has been hampered by several factors: Difficulty of designing experimental studies because of ethical issues such as creating a com\u00adparison group for whom interpretation is not provided. This could be overcome by conducting before and after studies in institutions planning implementation of a new interpreter service. Lack of funding for large-scale studies that would permit a well-designed, controlled trial of language assistance. Limited or non-existent use of standardized definitions of the term interpreter and translation. In order to conduct broader organizational comparisons, reliable and valid measures of interpreta\u00adtion quality will need to be developed. A review of the practices of organizations implementing these services may assist in the identification of effective measures. The need for national studies, large government databases, and health care organizations/plans to collect data on the primary language of patients and interpreter service use. Difficulty getting smaller studies published because of lack of understanding among reviewers of issues described above. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 41 PART TWO: ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTS IV. C ATEGORY C: O RGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTS FOR CULTURAL COMPETENCE Organizational supports for cultural competence encompass activities that can be undertaken at the organizational level to support the delivery of cultural competence interventions. (For details about the organizational supports, consult the text, commentary, and discussion on CLAS standards 8-14 in the CLAS Standards Report (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Secretary, 2000).) They may be prerequisites to implementing other CLAS interventions, and are necessary if the organization as a whole is to be culturally competent. Methodological and/or policy considerations affecting future research will not be discussed separately for each organizational support, but will be discussed for all organizational supports at the end of this section. Because implementing these types of activities requires considerable effort and resources from health care organizations, there is a natural desire to know whether taking these steps has a positive impact on the efficient implementation of cultural competence interventions, patient and staff satisfaction, appropriate utilization of services, the cost-effectiveness of services, the quality of services, and other desirable effects. However, it may be that organizational supports should only be evaluated for their impact on the effective\u00ad ness and efficiency of clinical cultural competence interventions, not on patient outcomes, since their pri\u00ad mary purpose is to improve the infrastructure of the organization and patient outcomes are too far removed. State of the Literature Many cultural competence supports have been implemented in a variety of different types of health care settings. Some of those organizations have conducted basic evaluations of their programming, and others need assistance from researchers to design and develop evaluations or outcome studies. At this time, very little published research has been identified that specifically examines the processes and outcomes of orga\u00adnizational supports for cultural competence. The literature describes single activities (as opposed to multi- element, systemic interventions) that can be institutionalized at an organizational level, such as the develop\u00ad ment of information systems, the implementation of training, or the recruitment of diverse staffing. A brief synthesis of the literature for each organizational support on which literature could be located is listed below. Most of the discussion, however, outlines areas of research that might help us better understand the benefit of these accommodations. 42 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTS Research Agenda on Management, Policy and Implementation Strategies to Institutionalize Cultural Competence Activities Definition Management, policy, and implementation strategies to institutionalize cultural competence activities include written organizational strategic plans that outline clear goals, policies, operational plans; initial and ongoing organizational self-assessments of cultural competence-related activities; and management ac\u00ad countability/oversight mechanisms to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services. Synthesis of Findings from Literature Review The literature consists primarily of descriptions of different approaches to implementing cultural competence activities in an organization, with very little analysis of outcomes. Two studies examine the different factors and forces that led to successful and unsuccessful implementation of cultural competence interventions. Key Research Questions In general, more documentary evidence is needed of the step-by-step processes of implementing cultural competence activities, as well as evaluations of what processes are more successful than others. Further work investigating the barriers and supports for successful implementation programs is also necessary. Other issues worth investigating include: What factors or forces encourage management to commit to cultural competence (e.g., regulatory, community pressure, staff pressure, and market-expansion aspirations)? How does cultural com\u00adpetence get adopted into the organization through non-management channels (e.g., staff-driven efforts to implement discrete activities in a piecemeal approach)? Under what circumstances is the centralization of responsibility for the organization's cultural com\u00ad petency more/less effective than decentralized approaches? At what levels of an organization, if any, is staff responsible for cultural competency in the organization more effective than tasking cultural competency to staff with other duties? What are the barriers or limitations to the adoption of cultural competence strategies (e.g., cost, time, resource allocation, staff, and lack of expertise)? What is required to overcome these barriers? Does the existence of explicit plans and strategies for the implementation of cultural competence interventions facilitate and improve the delivery of those services over an ad hoc approach? Are there any organizational preconditions or critically necessary management or policy compo\u00ad nents required for the successful implementation of desired interventions? What impact does the implementation of organizational self-assessment have on: staff awareness of cultural competence and the needs of culturally diverse populations, motivating improvements on cultural competence within the organization, improving the quantity and quality of culturally competent services over time, and overall organizational strategic planning? Do organizational cultural competence assessment tools have to be organization-specific (e.g., for hospitals, health plans, community health centers) or can they be generic? Can instruments be designed to reliably compare cultural competence across organizations? Should assessment tools measure the ability to provide CLAS to specific ethnic/cultural popula\u00ad tions, or should it measure the ability to serve diverse groups? SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 43 PART TWO: ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTS Research Agenda on Community Involvement in Cultural Competence Program Planning, Design, Implementation, Governance, Training, and Research Definition Community involvement includes participatory, collaborative partnerships with communities, and formal and informal mechanisms to facilitate community and patient/consumer involvement in designing and imple\u00ad menting cultural competence-related activities. Synthesis of Findings from Literature Review Many stakeholders have postulated that involving ethnic communities in the design of programs will lead to higher satisfaction with and better utilization of services. Community input mechanisms that have been described in literature include surveys, telephone and in-person interviews, focus groups, community meet\u00ad ings, community advisory committees, community members on standing organizational committees, and community member participation in program design and evaluation committees. For discussion of the relevant literature, see Category A-Research Agenda on Family/Community Inclusion in Health Care Delivery and the below Research Agenda on Design and Use of Surveys and Profile Instru\u00ad ments to Plan for Services and Measure Satisfaction and Quality. Key Research Questions What are the desirable, measurable outcomes of obtaining community input at the organizational or programmatic level? Which outcomes benefit the users of services or the community, and which benefit the organization? What mechanisms for obtaining input maximize which out\u00ad comes? Does having ethnic community advisory committees or other mechanisms of community input have a measurable and beneficial effect on the successful implementation and acceptance of plans, policies, and programs of culturally competent interventions, either at the organizational or programmatic level? What are effective models for soliciting input to inform organizational strategic planning? To what extent is community input used in subsequent decision-making processes? Does the existence of community input mechanisms improve the perception of a health care organization among the community and/or result in increased health care-seeking behavior or utilization of services? What are the best ways to obtain fair representation in community participation activities of the different communities that the organization serves? What methods are useful for supporting ongoing involvement by consumer representatives? 44 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTS Research Agenda on Design/Use of Surveys and Profile Instruments to Plan for Services, and Measure Satisfaction and Quality Definition Surveys and profile instruments can be integrated into internal audits, performance improvement pro\u00ad grams, patient satisfaction assessments, and outcomes-based evaluations. Synthesis of Findings from Literature Review Several descriptive studies examine multifaceted processes of developing survey instruments that are cul\u00ad turally appropriate for the purposes of gathering information to design and deliver health services. Quantita\u00adtive and qualitative methods are used to gather relevant cultural information for the purposes of survey design, pilot testing and modification of the tool. Collaboration with communities in developing instruments was described in some of the studies. Key Research Questions What kinds of survey information do organizations need to monitor the impact of culturally appropriate programs and systems? How are valid tools developed to gather information on patient satisfaction, given the difficulty of reliably measuring satisfaction across ethnic groups? What level of community input, data gathering and testing is necessary to develop culturally valid tools for information gathering, as many health care organizations have neither the time nor resources to engage in complex survey development processes for the purposes of service planning and design? Are there model instruments or templates that can be easily adapted? What are the benefits of the process of involving the community in survey design, above and beyond implementing an acceptable tool? Does the availability of cross-cultural health information systems result in beneficial utilization by providers and patients? Is this information incorporated into practice or behavioral change? What information delivery systems are most acceptable and most reliable? What are best practices in providing information about cross-cultural health care and cultural competence issues for everyday use by providers and staff? What kind of content is likely to be accessed on a regular basis? What training is needed for such a database to be utilized? Should it be a stand-alone system or incorporated into other information systems? The following topics were not included in the original literature search. However, research questions are discussed on the following pages. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 45 PART TWO: ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTS Research Agenda on Cultural Competence Self-Assessments and Ethnic Data Collection/Community Profiles Definition Cultural competence efforts are built upon an understanding of what populations a health care organization is serving. Ethnic data collection and the development of community profiles are thought to be an impor\u00ad tant cornerstone for cultural competence planning. Data collection includes documenting patient/consumer race, ethnicity, and spoken and written language in health records; integrating these data into the organization's management information systems; and periodically updating them. Data collection at the community level includes demographic, cultural, and epidemiological profiles of the community as well as needs assessments to accurately plan for and implement services that respond to the cultural and linguistic characteristics of the service area. Key Research Questions What impact does the implementation of organizational self-assessments have on: staff percep\u00ad tion of cultural competence and the needs of culturally diverse populations; motivating improve\u00adments on cultural competence within the organization; improving the quantity and quality of cultural competence services over time, and overall strategic planning? What remains to be done to develop valid and reliable instruments to assess organizational cultural competence? Is it possible and/or desirable to develop instruments that compare cultural competence across organizations, or do we want to simply be able to measure cultural competence within a single organization? What replicable models exist for the collection of race/ethnicity/language (r/e/l) data? Who should be involved in the planning of data collection systems? Who should be trained to collect such data? What adjustments to management information systems are necessary to integrate r/e/l data with other institutional data that would reveal trends in health status and health care delivery outcomes? How can the reliability of data collection on providers be improved (e.g., the accuracy of pro\u00advider self-reports on language proficiency)? What are the resistance factors to providing, collecting and utilizing r/e/l data among both pa\u00ad tients and health care providers? Are there ways these concerns can be allayed? What type of training and/or information is needed to improve attitudes and practices towards data collection practices? What level of detail related to r/e/l data is needed to adequately plan for and monitor the delivery of culturally competent services in health care organizations? (E.g., how many Arabic inter\u00adpreters are needed? How many African-American clinicians should be in my network? Should a special PAP smear outreach program be developed for Vietnamese women?) What is the impact of the absence of formal policy related to r/e/l data collection at the time of enrollment and/or clinical care intakes? 46 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART TWO: ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTS Does the easy availability of r/e/l data improve the timely delivery of culturally competent ser\u00ad vices, such as insuring an interpreter is present for appointments, sending materials in the appro\u00ad priate language, or assigning enrollees to a concordant clinician if the enrollee doesn't select a clinician? How do patients use r/e/l data in selecting providers? Does that choice result in better out\u00ad comes? Does it result in adverse selection problems for providers? Research Agenda on Culturally Appropriate Ethics, Conflict, and Grievance Resolution Processes Definition Ethics, conflict, and grievance resolution processes that are culturally and linguistically sensitive and capable of identifying, preventing, and resolving cross-cultural conflicts or complaints by patients/consumers are important for equitable treatment of minority patients/consumers. Key Research Questions What models exist to facilitate the discussion and resolution of culture-related conflict situa\u00ad tions, and are they culture-specific or usable generically across multiple ethnic groups? How can staff be best prepared for dealing with these situations in a way that minimizes the danger to clinician-patient trust, and what institutional policies work best to support staff and patients, especially in environments where many cultures are being served? Does the existence of culturally sensitive ethics, conflict, and grievance resolution systems prevent or improve the resolution of culturally based conflicts? Research Agenda on Public Information about CLAS Standards Performance Definition Public information about progress on and successful innovations in implementing the CLAS standards, and public notice in communities about the availability of this information, can provide incentives to health care organizations to put a priority on cultural competence. Key Research Questions What kinds of information do ethnically diverse populations want, need and use to make deci\u00ad sions about choosing health care providers and health care organizations? What types of infor\u00admation do purchasers want? Do issues of cultural and linguistic competence enter into decision-making processes? How can this information best be presented for different audiences? SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 47 PART TWO: ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTS Research Agenda on Implementation of all the CLAS Standards as a Comprehensive Organizational Strategy Definition The CLAS standards can function effectively as individual standards or as a comprehensive strategy to improve cultural competence across all facets of an organization. Implementation of all the CLAS stan- dards as a comprehensive organizational strategy may produce greater impact than implementing the standards individually. Key Research Questions What is the financial cost of implementing a comprehensive, organization-wide approach to cultural competence, such as described in the CLAS standards (including a determination of administrative burdens)? What is the administrative burden of putting these standards in place? Are there other non-cost barriers to accepting the implementation of CLAS activities? Will integration of standards put an organization into a deficit position or does non-compliance put an organization into a deficit position? Can cultural competence be integrated into other efforts rather than exist as a competing ef\u00ad fort? What can be learned about incentives/barriers to compliance with other regulatory measures to change provider behavior (e.g., the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act) that might be applicable to successful implementation of the CLAS standards? Methodological and/or Policy Considerations Influencing Future Research Studies of organizational interventions must compete with clinical studies for the research resources. Be\u00ad cause clinical research has a more obvious direct impact on patient outcomes, both organizations and funders have favored it over research on organizational interventions. Most organizations that have implemented organizational interventions have done so because they believe in their effectiveness and are not inclined to produce evidence that they indeed work. Education and incentives may be needed to persuade health care organizations to test organizational interventions. With respect to the types of studies that could be conducted, there need to be more comparisons of out\u00ad comes between organizations that do implement organizational supports for cultural competence and those that do not. Design issues will be complicated by the fact that many of these supports are not implemented in isolation but several at a time, and determining what intervention is responsible for what effect will be difficult, as will isolating other confounding variables. It will also be difficult to conduct studies that require large sample sizes because of the limited number of institutions involved in implementing organizational supports for cultural competence. 48 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE Part Three METHODOLOGICAL AND PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE PART THREE: METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES While there is a common interest in better understanding the impact of cultural competence interventions, different stakeholders may be interested in different types of outcomes. Current research points to links between cultural competence interventions and intermediary outcomes, but the considerable methodological challenges of isolating the effects of cultural competence in the context of rigorous study designs will complicate the likelihood of making direct correlations between the interventions and improvements in health status or cost savings. Standardized data collection is essential for the feasibility and comparability of re\u00ad search in this area, and barriers to such data collection may continue to hamper research efforts for some time. Better awareness of cultural competence issues and linkages between key stakeholders will improve possibilities for research funding, publication, and dissemination. I. M ETHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES TO CONDUCTING CULTURAL COMPETENCE RESEARCH There are a number of methodological challenges to conducting cultural competence research, especially research that seeks to make direct correlations between a cultural competence intervention and outcomes such as improvements in health status or cost savings. Some of the challenges are unique to specific inter\u00ad ventions, but most are universal across all categories, and similar to those encountered in designing empirical studies on other emerging, multifaceted health interventions. Definitions of Cultural Competence in Health Care There are many different conceptual definitions of cultural competence in health care, and myriads of interventions and practices that purport to be culturally competent. Research that intends to evaluate the impacts of culturally competent interventions requires a consistent set of comparable elements. As a starting point, the overarching conceptual definition that guided this project was taken from the CLAS Standards Report (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Secretary, 2000), which is based on Cross et al. (1989). Cultural and linguistic competence is a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and poli-cies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals that enables effective work in cross-cultural situations. \"Culture\" refers to integrated patterns of human be-havior that include the language, thoughts, communications, actions, customs, beliefs, values, and institutions of racial, ethnic, religious, or social groups. \"Competence\" im- plies having the capacity to function effectively as an individual and an organization within the context of the cultural beliefs, behaviors, and needs presented by consumers and their communities. As part of the introduction process at the April 2000 meeting, members of the Research Advisory Commit\u00adtee (RAC) were asked to share their definitions of cultural competence. Several levels of cultural compe\u00ad tence were described, including sensitivity and awareness, mechanisms and interventions to facilitate im\u00adproved outcomes, an integrated belief system, and enhanced communication to improve knowledge regarding differences and how they impact health belief systems and utilization. Some participants described cultural competence as an approach that should be adopted by organizations, including mechanisms, interventions, goals, and dimensions of care and services. Several individuals cited that they would like to see a movement towards operationalizing cultural and linguistic competence from this type of systems perspective. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 51 PART THREE: METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES Specific definitions of cultural competence shared by RAC members included the following: Mechanisms to promote culturally and linguistically appropriate services that produce impacts on treatment, access and outcomes. An everyday affair that needs to be routine, and needs to be lived, and needs to be experienced. An essential element of what we do, not so much a mechanism, or a process, or a vehicle but rather a core element. A worldview and realization that there are very different premises about what constitutes health, disease, wellness, and what one should do about them, specifically by enhancing communication among different levels of the health care delivery system with populations and key stakeholders. An integration of a worldview with a specific set of skills. Cultural competency is systemic and must be dealt with at multiple levels of system intervention. Education to enhance acceptance and awareness that cultural competency can influence and impact health services delivery. A strategy for encouraging systems change that results in increased patient satisfaction and improved health outcomes. Population-based interventions. Models that reflect the values and beliefs of the service popula\u00ad tion. Individual respect and collaboration. Being sensitive to issues that need to be addressed, yet may not be verbally communicated. A dimension of care or services. Quality of care and services. Cultural appropriateness and responsiveness. Conceptual definitions are useful for elucidating the theoretical underpinnings and broad goals of cultural competence, but specific, activity-related definitions are necessary for both programmatic implementation and impact evaluation. For the purposes of conducting the literature review and developing topical research agendas, the project team focused on specific cultural competence interventions that might be correlated to improve health care delivery and health outcomes. As mentioned in Part One, the final list was derived primarily from the interventions described in the CLAS Standards Report, as supplemented by Brach and Fraser (2000). The list of cultural competence interventions can be found at the beginning of Part Two of this report. The list of interventions can be said to constitute a general framework for the overall notion of cultural competence, especially within health care organizations. However, analysis of literature on these activities strongly highlights the lack of consistent parameters, standards and definitions within individual activities. For example, cultural competence training means something different with respect to content, format, trainer qualifications, and trainee assessment in every single incarnation. From a practice standpoint, this makes it difficult to determine which approach is best for any given environment or population. From the research perspective, this variation makes comparison between studies or generalizability virtually impossible. Another example of the impact of varying definitions is in the area of interpretation services. Before the issuance of Federal guidance (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, 52 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART THREE: METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES 2000), a health care institution could claim to provide interpreter services whether those interpreters were janitorial staff or trained and qualified medical interpreters. A review of the literature examining the impact of interpretation on satisfaction, comprehension, and other outcomes shows that comparing results among different studies is impossible due to varying definitions used, or due to a total lack of definition of the concept of interpreter. Other effects of the lack of standardized definitions are discussed further in the individual research agendas. Practitioners may resist attempts to standardize cultural competence interventions, and in fact, such stan\u00addardization may not be desirable. It is clear that many apparently successful cultural competence programs grew organically out of needs expressed by their communities. Many have suggested that true cultural competence, by definition, defies categorization or comparative evaluation. In other words, the needs of one neighborhood may be quite different from the services and approaches needed by another, even if they have similar demographic profiles. This consideration may become even more relevant when looking at culturally competent approaches involved in interpersonal encounters (e.g., between clinicians and patients). While it may be difficult to standardize interventional elements, it could be more important, and potentially more feasible, to standardize the evaluative measures of cultural competence. For example, when assessing the impact of cultural competence training on health care providers, a single set of objective measures could be used to distinguish the varying levels of cultural competence exhibited by trainees and control group members. Currently there is no such standardization. Existing measures of organizational cultural compe\u00adtence vary greatly in their approaches, thus complicating their use in research. Beyond definitions, additional work is needed on theoretical models, research instruments, and data sources that define and enable measurement of cultural competence. The lack of baseline information and previ\u00ad ously published research suggests a certain level of complexity or the existence of impediments along with an absence of standardization among data collection instruments. Study Design Designing rigorous studies that intend to explore the link between cultural competence interventions and health and health care delivery outcomes poses a number of challenges as identified below. Strong analytic study designs ideally require experimental design randomization and prospective data acquisition. Such studies are lengthy and expensive. It may be difficult to document the incremental benefit of a culturally competent intervention over similar interventions that are not specifically culturally competent. For example, what sample size would be required to compare a generic clinical communications training, health promotion program or community health worker encounter to a program tailored with culturally competent elements to ensure that the extra benefit could be reliably quantified? It is important to clearly identify the change agent within the identified intervention. This is typically the provider of services, suggesting that it is necessary to have a large sample size of providers (rather than patients) in order to improve either the power or generalizability of the study. This will require treatment settings that can accommodate such studies (e.g., large pro\u00ad vider groups and managed care organizations). Interactions between mainstream health care providers and the populations that would poten\u00ad tially benefit from culturally competent interventions are characterized by subtle and frequently indefinable nuances that may stem from a number of sources (e.g., culture, language, age, gender, socio-economic and acculturation status). Determining the impact of interventions will SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 53 PART THREE: METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES be further complicated if clear definitions of the intervention and the desired outcomes are not well established. Considerable work must be done to develop study instruments that are themselves culturally competent (e.g., satisfaction instruments that are translated and reflect varying ethnic and cul\u00adtural values). For some interventions, such as health promotion and education, no instruments currently exist to measure the standard intervention. However, such tools are necessary to accurately compare the impact of culturally sensitive program intervention versus a standard program. With respect to comparing the outcomes of studies on culturally competent interventions, collec\u00adtive findings may not be generalizable because of wide variations in approaches to a particular intervention (e.g., duties of community health workers, or curricular elements of cultural com\u00ad petence training). Additionally, the impact of interventions may not be the same from one ethnic group or geographic community to another, or from one type or practice setting to another. 54 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART THREE: DATA CHALLENGES II. D ATA CHALLENGES Gathering adequately detailed data sets for analysis is among the primary challenges to conducting cultural competence research. These challenges relate to data collected expressly for the purposes of individual research projects, as well as data that should be collected routinely for internal institutional review, govern\u00ad ment oversight, and/or retrospective research analyses. There are multiple sources from which to gather data on interventions, particularly for use in historical cohort studies. These include existing medical, industry (managed care, HMO) and government resources (Federal and State health and human services agencies and bureaus, Federal clearinghouses), major litera\u00ad ture databases, private/independent foundations and health policy organizations and associations. However, many of these data sets are of limited value due to the absence of race, ethnicity and language (r/ e/l) characteristics on patients. Institutions frequently do not collect this information because of administra\u00ad tive or financial barriers, or perceived legal prohibitions or patient resistance. Organizations may fear being perceived as discriminatory for collection of race-related data, either at the time of collection, or because subsequent analysis reveals disparities in care and outcomes. When r/e/l data is collected, its comparability is often compromised by a lack of standardization. More specifically, the following issues will have to be addressed in order to facilitate large-scale data collec\u00ad tion for research on cultural competence interventions. Universal Issues Identification of a standardized list of accepted cultural competence data elements (patient\u00adlevel and organizational-level) Clarification of misconceptions about the perceived illegality of collecting r/e/l data, and resolu\u00adtion of any outstanding conflicts between Federal and State rules, including those related to patient confidentiality. Efforts need to be made to comply with the Office of Management and Budget's role and ethnic standards (Office of Management and Budget, 1995), in order to promote standardization and comparability among data sets, although these standards may not facilitate close examination of country- or ethnic-specific population groups. Institutional Issues Assessment of data collection activities to identify gaps in data collection. Discussion and resolution of administrative barriers to obtaining and analyzing individual health outcome and cost data. Absence of standardized r/e/l data collection mechanisms will require institutions to develop policies and practices regarding information management system changes and subsequent data collection. Creation of incentives for providers to participate in experimental interventions, and subsequent data collection on them. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 55 PART THREE: DATA CHALLENGES Community/Individual Issues Clearer rationales for the purpose of data collection activities, both for administrative and re\u00ad search purposes. For example, ethnic community representatives could be involved in the de\u00adsign of data collection instruments for use in program design, quality assessment, and research. Patients could be informed that language information is being collected to plan for and assess the availability of interpreter services. Some target populations may resist the concept of participatory research further complicating data collection activities. RAC members have encountered anger and criticism from many communities about the \"ivory tower syndrome,\" where communities feel they have been stud\u00ad ied or experimented on without receiving anything tangible in return, including the results of studies. RAC members reported that many communities are no longer allowing themselves to be studied. Identifying participants for studies may be difficult. Individuals may have personal reasons (e.g., lack of time or family support, fear of unnecessary contact with 'authorities,' fear of documen\u00ad tation, etc.) for not wanting to participate, and attrition or mobility issues may affect participa\u00ad tion in long-term studies. 56 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART THREE: BETTER LINKS BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AND CULTURAL COMPETENCE EXPERTS III. B ETTER LINKS BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AND CULTURAL COMPETENCE EXPERTS The volume of currently published research should not be considered a definitive indicator of the number of efforts being made to establish the impact of cultural competence. Efforts are being undertaken to evaluate the impact of cultural competence interventions on outcomes by agencies and programs involved in program design and implementation. The aim of these assessments may not be to provide stringently controlled research information intended for publication, but rather to assess, validate and modify existing programs. Also, those most intimately familiar with culturally competent interventions may not have track records of running research studies and vice-versa. Efforts need to be made to enhance linkages between academic researchers and: Regional and national experts in cultural competence program design and standards-setting. Recipients of public and private funding who are initiating new programs or approaches. Health care providers and cultural competence intervention program managers, especially those involved in long-term data collection on their programs or on recipients of their services. Community leaders familiar with health problems and innovative interventions. Community-based researchers and evaluators. Funders of cultural competence interventions interested in program evaluation or empirical re\u00ad search These linkages can facilitate a number of objectives, including enhancing awareness of the variety of cul\u00adtural competence interventions, especially those that are 'state-of-the-art'; highlighting to program manag\u00ad ers and program funders the critical role of accurate data collection; and putting researchers in touch with potential study sites. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 57 PART THREE: FUNDING AND PUBLICATION ISSUES IV. F UNDING AND PUBLICATION ISSUES As a relatively nascent field of research, prospects for funding and publishing cultural competence studies tend to be complicated by a number of interrelated factors. Many national research initiatives tend to be focused on specific disease concerns, marginalizing the impact of social or cultural issues in the context of more clinical investigation objectives. Funding A lack of awareness among many funders and reviewers of the impact of language and culture on health care delivery often hampers receptivity to research proposals. This is exacerbated by the small number of well-designed studies in this area, which make it difficult to use previous research successes to buttress arguments for further research. The kinds of studies that are likely to show linkages between cultural competence interventions and health outcomes require significant amounts of funding, making some funders unwilling to take a chance on an area of research that is still seen as marginal or high-risk. In many cases, funding may be necessary for both the cost of mounting the intervention as well as the research itself. For many of the reasons described above, undertaking cultural competence investigations is also considered high risk by both committed and potential cultural competence researchers. Since the origin of funding is important in some academic institutions with respect to tenure and promotions, interest in this type of re\u00ad search needs to be generated in notable funding institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Centers for Disease Control and Preven\u00adtion, and major foundations. A number of recent funding initiatives by the NIH, (National Institute of Envi\u00ad ronmental Health Sciences and National Human Genome Research Institute, 2001; National Institutes of Health, 2001) show a new and promising level of interest in this area that should be embraced by research\u00aders and other funders. Researchers should also look for funding opportunities even when an initiative is not explicitly on cultural competence. For example, AHRQ has a program announcement on patient-centered care (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2001) that references culturally competent physician-patient communication as a potential study area, even though the announcement is not headlined as being related to cultural competence or racial/ethnic populations. Publication Researchers working in this area have observed that many journal reviewers and study review committees lack familiarity or experience with cultural competence issues, complicating receptivity to research propos\u00ad als and article submissions. Because cultural competence is often viewed as a topic of marginal interest, standards for acceptance appear to be higher, both from the perspective of study design as well as results. Often, the types of methodologies required to measure cultural competence are not embraced by reviewers. A number of mediating approaches can be used. Editors from various publications/journals should be edu\u00ad cated on the state of the field and what is considered acceptable and unacceptable science as it relates to cultural competence. Authors and field experts should be encouraged to engage in dialogue about the chal\u00adlenges of cultural competence research with journal editors within and outside the context of the review process. In some cases, the outcomes of culturally competent interventions may be more easily accepted if the information is embedded within the context of a larger, broader study, not the focus of the study. Efforts should also be made to submit research to journals that are more receptive to various types of studies, including administrative journals and non-U.S. based publications. 58 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE PART THREE: FUNDING AND PUBLICATION ISSUES At the research design level, efforts should also be made to address the concerns of health care organiza\u00ad tions participating in studies about how the project will affect ongoing operations or issues of confidentiality. Proprietary issues, publication or prior review requirements of a health plan may need to be addressed, along with the best approach for presenting the outcome of the research. Dissemination Overall, additional efforts need to be undertaken to communicate the most current knowledge on cultural competence research, including the proposed research agendas, to key stakeholders, including policymakers, providers, research funders, journal editors, and other researchers. National meetings highlighting current research, interventions, and information gaps, or dedicated workshops at other large meetings where such stakeholders meet, can be used to further efforts to improve the evidence base for cultural competence in health care.

C ATEGORY A: C ULTURALLY SENSITIVE INTERVENTIONS Cultural Competence Education and Training The majority of studies on cultural competence education and training were essentially descriptive, but some studies examined the impact on trainees and on care that was delivered. Descriptive Studies Studies primarily describe cultural competence training in different educational settings, including nursing, social work, pediatric, and child psychology programs (Culhane-Pera et al., 2000; Flores, Gee, and Kastner, 2000; Gamble, 2000; and Garcia, 1997; Sublette and Trappler, 2000). Some discussed different educational techniques and course development, duration of training, content, and cross cultural skill modules. Various teaching strategies were discussed. Training content described in the literature included a range of topics, such as an examination of issues pertinent to specific multicultural populations, cultural awareness and sensitivity, cross-cultural communica\u00adtion, use of language assistance services, culturally specific patient assessment and management, epidemio\u00ad logical assessment, and multicultural resource identification and utilization. Impact on Trainees The literature documented two applied study designs to assess impact: pre- and post- self reported change and quantifiable change. Studies that used self-assessment measurements of change in cultural knowledge with no comparison groups reported that participants felt their level of competency had increased signifi\u00adcantly (Allison et al., 1996; Culhane-Pera 1996; Kurtz, 1999; Napholz, 1999), although one study reported a single instance of a trainees' negative attitudes intensi\u00ad fying as a result of an intervention (Sachdev, 1997). Some studies reported that change occurred in some areas of awareness and sensitivity, while not in others (Copeman, 1989; Farnill et al., 1997). While one study that compared a group of trainees to a group that did not receive training showed an impact in some aspects of cross-cultural adaptability (Majumdar, Keystone, and Cuttress, 1999), another study that compared \"cul\u00adture school\" students with those who received alternative training found no difference in knowledge gains between the two groups (Smith, 1998). Some of these studies examined the impact of variations in presentation and training content. The literature described a wide range of cultural competence training methods, including lecture, clinical contacts, video\u00ad taped consultations, student log-books, community medicine projects, and affective methods. One study found that the affective approach led to higher scores in the areas of awareness and cultural competency than a more knowledge-based approach to teaching (Edwards, 1997). Kurtz (1999) described a structured, psycho-educational group format, using supportive self-help components. Salcido and Garcia (1997) found greater impacts demonstrated by trainees who used a video-training model over a helping skills or culture- specific model. Not all studies found differences in the impact of interventions they examined. Naphotz (1999) found both innovative and traditional cultural sensitivity improved nursing students' skill assessment scores. Pruegger and Rogers (1994) found no differences demonstrated in pre- and post-tests between the experiential approach and the lecture approach, although qualitative data from personal documents indicated significantly greater effects of the experiential treatment. 68 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE APPENDIX TWO: EDUCATION AND TRAINING LITERATURE Impact on Care Few studies went beyond examining the impact of training on trainees to see what impact trained clinicians have on patients. Wade and Bernstein (1991) found that counseling clients assigned to experienced counse\u00ad lors who had received culture sensitivity training rated their counselor higher on credibility and relationship measures, returned for more follow-up sessions, and expressed greater satisfaction with counseling than did clients assigned to experienced counselors who had not received the additional training (control condition). Although same-race counseling dyads resulted in less client attrition, this factor did not influence client perceptions of counselors and the counseling process. Norman (1999) reported that patients of experienced counselors who had received cross-cultural psycho-educational intervention on counseling graduate stu\u00ad dents reduced two of five measured symptoms of borderline personality disorder diagnosis, compared to patients of experienced counselors who did not receive the training. Lefley (1984) found that cross-cultural training of mental health clinicians and administrator led to a signifi\u00ad cant increase in minority use of services and reductions of drop-out rates. Thom and Tirado (2000) are in the process of looking at the impact of a cultural competence training intervention on measures of cultural competency, patient trust and satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and control of diabetes and hypertension. There is a need to define which are the most desirable outcomes from the patient-provider relationship, and which are the most reliable indicators of positive improvements that result from training. Measuring satisfac\u00ad tion may have more to do with a response to someone's personality than the effect of training. Research Considerations Across all the studies there are fundamental problems with the myriad definitions of training: since there is no universal standard for training, nor a standard definition of cultural competence, there can be no compa\u00adrability from one study to another of the \"cultural competence\" of subjects participating in different training programs. This suggests that first we must study what behaviors and attitudes have an impact on the delivery of care, then we need to study what teaching methods work best to improve them. The content of training described in these studies varied widely, and was not always thoroughly described. It is difficult to discern whether different approaches to content resulted in better post-training scores, and impossible to make a link to improved behavior. The vast majority of studies relied on pre-post self-assessments, did not utilize control groups appropriately or at all, and did not measure impact on trainees' behavior or on patients. The training interventions studied were mostly aimed at students, not providers, making it impossible to assess changes in behavior or service delivery. The following additional research questions emerge from the literature. Are different educational techniques such as videotaping and experiential training significantly more effective than didactic training? Do some have a greater impact on behaviors and actions? Is there a certain level of improvement in knowledge or awareness that needs to be obtained before it can effectively translate into action? Can variations in behavior be attributed to level of knowledge, awareness or sensitivity? Do the effects of training vary in student populations versus provider populations? SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 69 APPENDIX TWO: EDUCATION AND TRAINING LITERATURE Are site/geographic-specific training modules more effective than general training? How are site needs determined and how effective are site-specific modules when population demograph\u00ad ics change? Do patient-based outcomes shift? Are outcome differences associated with individuals who already have an interest in cultural issues? Does the potential exist for reinforcing negative perceptions and attitudes as a result of different training formats? Further research should examine provider behaviors and client perceptions and outcomes. Further quantitative and qualitative examinations are needed to assess cultural competence predictors (e.g., motivation for attending training, level of education, participation motivation, race, diversity of client contacts and experience). Can education on cultural issues translate into changes in behavior and service delivery in the absence of skills training? Are the effects of training sustainable? 70 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE APPENDIX Design/Methodology Culhane-Pera KA, Like RC, To identify the current status and \u008a 58% of responding family prac- Survey Lebensohn-Chialv o P, Loewe R content of the curricula and de - tice residency programs have (2000) termine facilitating and impeding an informal curriculum on multi- Study P articipants: Family prac- factors to multicultural curricula. cultural issues, 28% have a formal curriculum, and 14% have no curriculum. tice residency programs \u008a Programs with a formal curricu - lum teach more content, em - ploy more educational meth - ods, use more evaluation tech - niques, and feel more success - ful than programs with an in - formal curriculum. \u008a Factors that f acilitate curricula: cultural diversity of communi - ties and residents, multicultural interests of faculty and resi - dents, and faculty's multicul - tural expertise. \u008a There was a marked increase in the prevalence of multicul - tural curricula in family practice residencies from 1985 to 1998.

SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 76 APPENDIX TWO: RACIAL, ETHNIC , AND LINGUISTIC CONCORDANCE LITERATURE Racial, Ethnic, and Linguistic Concordance It is theorized that successful delivery of health services to different racial and ethnic populations requires an understanding of the cultural milieu of each distinct community, as well as the trust of communities and individual patients. This understanding and trust can be obtained by securing staffing patterns that mirror the targeted service population, although this can be difficult to achieve, especially for management positions (Glover, Shi, and Samuels, 1997). Saha and colleagues (2000) found that black and Hispanic Americans sought care from physicians of their own race or ethnicity because of personal preference and language. Language concordance achieved through teaching of \"medical Spanish\" is discussed in Category B of this appendix. Impact on Service Utilization Most of the research in this area has been conducted in the mental health field. Studies have reported that client-therapist language or ethnic match positively affected participation in treatment and increased the number of sessions of mental health treatment (Blank et al., 1994; Flaskerud, 1986; Flaskerud and Hu, 1994; 1991; Takeuchi, Sue, and Yeh, 1995; Wade and Bernstein, 1991). Combined ethnic and language match has been shown to be associated with reduced emergency room visits by mental health patients (Snowden, Hu, and Jerrell, 1995), and language match alone has been associated with lower hospi\u00ad tal admission rates (Lee and Rosenberg, 1998). However, evidence of concordance's impact on drop out rates is decidedly mixed. One study found a decrease in the drop-out rate for only ethnic match (Flaskerud and Liu, 1991), while another study found no ethnic match effect but language match for one particular sub\u00ad population (Cambodians) increased drop-out rates (Flaskerud and Liu, 1990). A third study found that language and ethnic matches increased drop-out rates (Flaskerud, 1986). Impact on Health Outcomes Most studies that examined concordance's impact on health outcomes did not document improvements in health status of functioning (Flaskerud and Hu, 1994; Flaskerud and Liu, 1990, 1991; 1994; Takeuchi, Sue, and Yeh, 1995. The one exception was Porter and Beuf (1994), who found that African-American patients with vitiligo (a disfiguring skin disease) show better adjustment after treatment in predominantly a black hospital than African-American patients treated at a hospital where staff was mostly white. Impact on Satisfaction and Patient-physician Communication Black Americans report higher satisfaction, and receipt of preventive and other medical services with physicians of their own race, and Hispanics were more likely to report being \"very satisfied\" with their health care when seeing Hispanic physicians (Saha et al., 1999). Porter and Beuf (1994) found that African Americans were more positive to concordant physicians and hospital settings. Similarly, Cooper-Patrick and colleagues (1999) found that patients rated race concordant physicians as having a more participatory decision-making style, which was correlated with satisfaction. In contrast, Handler and colleagues (1996) found that the race/ethnicity of the caregiver was the one characteristic that did not appear to affect satis\u00adfaction with prenatal services. Similarly, Rubin (1999) found no effect on satisfaction of racial match be\u00ad tween parents and their children's case managers. Research Considerations More research is needed to document the effects of matching with greater attention to minority oriented programs. Numerous methodological complexities need to be considered when measuring the impact of SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 77 APPENDIX TWO: RACIAL, ETHNIC , AND LINGUISTIC CONCORDANCE LITERATURE racial and ethnic concordance in health services. For example, Sawyer and colleagues (1995) identified conceptual issues for cultural matching in research projects that included: 1) what to match (e.g., ethnicity, geographic area and/or residence, language, social class, social values, gender, etc.), 2) when to match, and 3) feasibility of matching (availability and costs). 78 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE APPENDIX TWO: RACE, ETHNIC Design/Methodology Glover SH, Shi L, Samuels ME To examine the role of community \u008a Community and migrant health Descriptive (1997) and migrant health centers in centers have higher percent- eliminating barriers that typically ages of minorities in top man- limit the professional advance - agement positions than general ment of minority and women management, but do not nec - health care professionals. essarily reflect the minority compositions of the centers' service population.

SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 84 APPENDIX TWO: COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS LITERATURE Community Health Workers There is an abundance of descriptive literature on community health workers. Researchers have also examined the impact of community health workers on service utilization, health status, and satisfaction, although the volume of studies is considerably less. Descriptive The literature described the use of lay health advisors, content and structure of visitations, and how lay health advisors were utilized as part of a corrective strategy to supplement or modify existing programs. Buchanan (1999) described the successful use of promotoras in a teaching program aimed at increasing the number of health promoting behaviors among Hispanic adults. Earp and Flax (1999) reported documenting program process in terms of frequency of meeting times, group/individual encounters, and purpose/focus of meetings. Impact on Utilization of Preventive Services Studies indicated that the use of community health workers or lay health workers have a significant impact on the recruitment and utilization of preventive services. Burhansstipanov and colleagues (2000) reported that trained lay advisors were essential to gaining trust among American Indian women and were successful in increasing mammography screening utilization. Fernandez and colleagues (1999) reported increases in mammography screening among minority women and Weber and Reilly (1997) found the use of culturally sensitive case management increased screening rates nearly threefold. Bird and colleagues (1998) docu\u00admented the increase in recognition, receipt and maintenance of breast and cervical cancer screening activi\u00ad ties among an experimental group of Vietnamese women educated by indigenous lay health workers. The use of bicultural community health workers in the Hispanic population was found to improve completion rates of a diabetes education program as described by Corkery and colleagues (1997). Impact on Health Status Community health workers can impact health status by effectuating change in behavior, service utilization, and adherence, but few studies have examined those effects. For example, Corkery and colleagues (1997) found that although community health workers did not have a statistically significant independent effect on glycohemoglobin levels, they did improve completion rates of a diabetes education program which in turn improved glycemic control. Barnes-Boyd, Norr, and Nacion (1996) found reductions in infant mortality correlated with home visits by teams of trained nurses and community health workers, although the reductions did not achieve statistical significance. Impact on Satisfaction A single study (Rodney et al., 1998) examined community health advocates' (CHA) impact on satisfaction. Researchers evaluated a community health advocacy program from three perspectives; management, health advocates and clients of health advocates. A subjective analysis revealed that all three groups were highly satisfied with the role and impact of CHAs, however, CHAs also described systematic barriers that prevent them from working effectively. The author postulate that the impact of CHAs on utilization and outcomes would be greater if these barriers were addressed. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 85 APPENDIX TWO: COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS LITERATURE Research Considerations Future research needs to assess both program outcomes and health status outcomes, if arguments for incorporating lay worker outreach efforts into programs are to be validated. Process evaluation questions that need to be examined include: What proportion of the targeted population is successfully reached by community health workers? Who is the program failing to reach, and why? Do community health workers bridge gaps between what people in the community know, think, or understand, and what they need to maximize health utilization and outcomes? The strength of scientific evidence linking community health workers directly to health outcomes is limited. Unfortunately, scientific studies linking community health workers to health outcomes will be somewhat difficult to conduct because the changing dynamics of targeted communities can also influence targeted outcomes. Outcome questions that need to be examined include: What components of the community health worker's role are effective in meeting community- based needs? Which of these can be linked with behavioral change? Which changes can be linked to improvements in utilization and health outcomes? 86 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE APPENDIX TWO: COMMUNITY HEALTH Findings Study Design/Methodology Buchanan TJ (1999) To determine the impact of promotoras (lay advisors) on the number of health promoting be - haviors practices by Mexican- American adults. \u008a The promotoras teaching pro- gram was found to have a posi - tive effect on the number of health promoting behaviors practiced by Mexican Ameri - cans.

SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 90 APPENDIX TWO: CULTURALLY COMPETENT HEALTH PROMOTION Culturally Competent Health Promotion In addition to many articles describing various culturally competent health promotion interventions, a number of studies looked at the impact of these interventions on satisfaction, knowledge increase, behavior, utiliza\u00ad tion of preventive services, and health status. These studies, by and large, did not measure the additional impact of implementing a culturally competent health promotion intervention beyond the impact of imple\u00ad menting a health promotion intervention that was not specifically designed to be culturally competent. In\u00ad stead they demonstrated that culturally competent health promotion interventions could be effective with minority populations. Descriptive Studies A number of articles described the process of designing programs and the methods and process of interven\u00ad tions used (Blackford and Street, 1999; Chen et al., 1992; Edwards et al., 1992; Gilliland et al., 1998; Griffin et al., 1999; Jackson et al., 1997; al., Mas et al., 2000; Stillman et al., 1993). These interventions were largely developed in response to research showing a relationship between cultural beliefs and health behavior and service utilization (e.g., Bailey, Erwin and Belin (2000)). Impact on Satisfaction Griffin and colleagues (1999) found that participants responded positively to Native American Diabetes Project's culturally competent education program. Mattson and Lew (1992) found that a majority of clients of the culturally competent Southeast Asian Health Project were satisfied with the prenatal care they received. Neither study employed comparison groups. Rubin (1999) measured parents' satisfaction with their children's case managers and found that parents' perceptions of the case managers' cultural compe\u00ad tence were related to those assessments. Impact on Knowledge Increase Flaskerud and Nyamathi (1990) described the impact of standard health promotion interventions on minority populations, and some evidence that cultural norms need to be taken into account was produced (Flaskerud, Nyamathi, and Uman, 1997). Several articles describing culturally competent health promotion interventions reported increases in knowledge among the target population. Some of them used control or comparison groups to control for secular trends (Alcalay et al., 1999; Dignan et al., 1998; Ferguson, 1996; Litrownik et al., 2000; Marin and Perez-Stable, 1995), while others only conducted pre- and post-tests (Duffy et al., 1994; Marin et al., 1990) or cross-sectional analyses (Marin and Perez-Stable, 1995). Not all studies found evidence of knowledge increases (Flaskerud and Akutsu 1993). Only Stevenson and colleagues (1995) examined the difference in impact between a culturally sensitive and culturally dissimilar intervention, a video education on HIV for African-American teenagers, and found that while both approaches were effective in increasing AIDS knowledge scores, only the culturally sensitive intervention was effective with adolescents who claimed to \"know a lot about AIDS.\" This last study in particular suggests that interventions may need to be highly specific and targeted to subgroups and subcul\u00adtures as well as ethnicity in order to be optimally effective. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 91 APPENDIX TWO: CULTURALLY COMPETENT HEALTH PROMOTION Impact on Behavior Research results on culturally competent health promotion interventions' impact on behavior are mixed. Ferguson (1996) demonstrated that while knowledge increased as a result of peer counseling in a culturally- specific pregnancy program for African-American females, there was no difference between experimental and comparison groups in their use of effective methods of contraception nor delays in initiating sexual intercourse. Marin and colleagues (1990) found that although knowledge of cessation services increased after a media-based community intervention, smoking among Hispanics did not decrease. On the other hand, Davis and colleagues (1995), showed reductions in tobacco use and increases in exercise as a result of cardiovascular education program for Navajo and Pueblo elementary school students. Studies have also found that a culturally competent cancer education program increased breast self-examination (Erwin et al., 1999; Erwin et al., 1996; Sung et al., 1997). One study with no comparison group showed improvements in diet among African-American women who participated in a culturally-sensitive dietary intervention (Barnhart et al., 1998). Another study, also with no comparison group, found increases of breast-feeding among Navajo women after implementation of a cul\u00adturally competent breastfeeding promotion program (Wright et al., 1997). Impact on Utilization of Preventive Services Research has shown that culturally sensitive health promotion can increase utilization preventive services such as mammography and pap smears (Dignan et al., 1998; Erwin et al., 1999; Erwin et al., 1996) and some researchers have gone on to explore what methods are most effective with particular populations. Bell and colleagues (1999) examined the response to different types of interventions to increase breast cancer screening among different ethnic minority women groups, and found that translated literature, a physician endorsement letter, and language support by outreach workers were most beneficial, but Urdu- and Gujarati\u00ad speaking groups were more likely to respond than Bengali and Somali speakers. McAvoy and Raza (1991) compared the effect of different methods of education on cervical cancer screening rates among Asian women and found that personal visits were most effective regardless of the health materials used, but videos may have been most effective with the hardest-to-reach group, Urdu speaking Moslem women. Yancey and colleagues (1995) found that videos shown in a clinic waiting room were also very effective in increasing cervical cancer screening among Blacks and Hispanics in both New York City and Los Angeles, and that similarity of results in both sites suggests that standard Spanish-language tapes may appeal to Latinos of different nationalities. Impact on Health Status Brown and Hanis (1999) described a diabetes education and support program developed with significant focus group and community input that was successful in significantly improving metabolic control in the target population. Jackson and colleagues (2000) described a health-care program culturally adapted to meet the needs of elderly Chinese residents, which resulted in reducing declines in health status. Nevid and Javier (1997) compared a multi-component, culturally-specific smoking cessation intervention with a self- help control group, and found that abstinence rates were significantly higher for the culturally-specific group at post treatment, with gradual declines in abstinence at six- and 12-month follow-ups but no long-term benefit was found for either method. Shintani and colleagues (1994) found that a traditional Hawaiian diet program resulted in weight loss, although long-term impacts need to be studied. Wang and Abbott (1998) showed that a disease management program operated in collaboration with the Chinese community in Ha\u00adwaii resulted in decreases in blood pressure and maintenance of glucose levels by Chinese with hypertension 92 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE APPENDIX TWO: CULTURALLY COMPETENT HEALTH PROMOTION and diabetes. A study in progress of a patient-centered, culturally tailored, education and activation interven\u00ad tion with active follow-up by a depression case manager for African American patients suffering from depression is expected to produce further findings regarding interventions' impact on health status (Cooper, 2001). Other Research Considerations Virtually all studies compared cultural competent health promotion activities with no intervention, rather than comparing them to standard interventions. Research to establish the marginal benefit of modifying standard interventions to diverse populations need to be undertaken, although the sample size required to detest statistically significant differences is very large. Studies to date have also not isolated elements of multi\u00ad component interventions to determine which elements or combinations of elements are responsible for re\u00adsults. Finally, questions remain as how to generalize the successful elements of interventions, both across types of programs, and/or across or among ethnicities.

SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 107 APPENDIX TWO: FAMILY/COMMUNITY INCLUSION LITERATURE Family/Community Inclusion in Health Care Delivery The underlying premise supporting inclusion is that family entities and community networks can act as agents to achieve improved social, behavioral and health outcomes in individuals more effectively than systems. Family/Community Inclusion Related to Clinical Encounters All studies used qualitative methods to inform family/community inclusion practices, but none evaluated the impact of family/community inclusion. Armenta (1993) conducted a descriptive study and found that educat\u00ad ing community-based stakeholders, holding bilingual programs with flexible hours and attendance incentives and supports could increase Latino parents' participation in a parent training program. Shapiro (1999) ana\u00ad lyzed videotaped clinical encounters to describe some of the essential components of a family orientation in the medical interview (e.g., more time, language concordance, clarification, and the provider's patient-centered style). Spiece and colleagues (2000) analyzed the content of focus groups with patients and provid\u00ad ers to isolate issues of family-patient-doctor communication related to cancer, and the challenges related to family inclusion in the clinical encounter. Suarez and colleagues (2000) examined the relationship between social networks and cancer screening practices among different Hispanic groups. Community Involvement in Program Planning Design, Implementation, Training and Research Several studies on community involvement focused on collaborations between local groups and the medical establishment and researchers. One study described the collaboration of community elders with medical residents (Anonymous, 2000). Banner and colleagues (1995) described the collaborative development with the Korean-American community of a survey instrument. The authors concluded that this participation helped assure that the survey was accessible and culturally acceptable to participants in the community, although this acceptability appears to be presumed and not formally measured. Similarly, Amundson and Trotter (1991) attributed a high response rate on an evaluation survey to the community participation throughout a project to develop a network of mental health workers for Pacific Islands. Chen (1997) also described a process to develop a cooperative community intervention to improve cancer screening among Korean women. The study documented several different mechanisms of inclusion (advisory board, staff recruited from the community, and using participatory research methods). Inclusion of the community resulted in high survey response rates and access to information about the community that might not otherwise have been available. 108 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE APPENDIX TWO: FAMILY/COMMUNITY INCLUSION LITERATURE Research Considerations There are several questions that could be studied related to the merits of better integration of family mem\u00ad bers in the health-care encounter, treatment negotiation, and facilitation of adherence to treatment plans. How can providers determine at the beginning of an encounter to what extent family members present or not present should be involved in discussing diagnosis and treatment options? Is there a difference between allowing the passive listening of family members in the encounter and directly involving them by soliciting their insights and commitment to assist? What styles of provider-patient-family interaction can be developed and taught to providers that easily involve all parties without overly lengthening the encounter period? What kinds of instructions can be given to family members and patients by providers that would facilitate patient adherence to treatment plans? Control groups are needed to isolate the effect of inclusion vs. many other dynamics taking place in medical encounters.

SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 112 APPENDIX TWO: TRADITIONAL PRACTICES /HEALERS LITERATURE Coordination of Conventional Medicine and Traditional Practices/Healers In many multicultural communities, illness and disease are often perceived to arise from a variety of causes, and may require the services of a traditional healer. Different terms to describe these healers are cited in the literature including, curandero, native healer, medicine man, shaman, spiritualist, herbal doctor, herbalist, etc. The practices of traditional healers are often categorized as alternative medicine. There is a plethora of published literature describing different alternative medicine practices. However, little scientific evidence exists that measures the impact of integration of traditional and conventional practices on health outcomes. Several common themes were found among studies describing traditional practices in the context of health care: utilization of alternative practices, integration into conventional systems of care, impact on service utilization, and conflict with conventional methods. Utilization of Traditional Practices and Healers Several studies documented that there is substantial use of herbal or folk remedies and some use of tradi\u00ad tional healers, and these are often used in conjunction with conventional medicine but relatively few patients inform their conventional medical practitioners (Bhopal, 1986; Elder, Gillcrist, 1996; Tabora and Flaskerud, 1997). Conflict between Traditional and Conventional Medicine Studies showed that conventional medical practitioners have generally accepted the use of traditional medi\u00ad cine and healers, but not universally or without restriction. Bhopal (1986) reported that at least half of the physicians surveyed felt that alternative practices should be encouraged unless shown to be harmful. Zubek (1994) reported that while family physicians accepted use of traditional treatments for benign illnesses or palliative care, many disagreed with their use for serious illnesses. Furthermore, conventional medical prac\u00ad titioners' limited knowledge of traditional practices and their potential merits or risks (Zubek, 1994) can present an obstacle to supporting or integrating approaches. Studies of patients' perspectives of the compatibility of traditional and conventional medicine produced contradictory results. Marbella and colleagues (1998) found that more than a third of the patients seeing healers received different advice from their physicians and healers. In contrast, Kim and Kwok (1998) reported that perceived conflict between native healer advice and medical provider advice was rare. Integration of Traditional and Conventional Approaches No studies were located that reported on the impact of programs that integrate traditional and conventional medical care. Four descriptions of such programs (Del Castillo, 1999; Foster, 1996; Kahn and Delk, 1973; Reissland and Burghart, 1989) are testimony that such programs can be implemented. Research Considerations Future research needs to examine the service utilization and health outcomes associated with utilization of traditional healers and practices, along with comparisons between conventional and traditional approaches, and measurable outcomes associated with the integration of methodologies.

C ATEGORY B: L ANGUAGE ASSISTANCE Language Barriers, Bilingual Services and Oral Interpretation, and Translated Written Materials A large literature documents the negative impact of language barriers and positive effects of interpreter services on patient comprehension, satisfaction, service utilization. Descriptive Several studies described gathering data to plan for interpreter services programs (Hornberger, Itakura, and Wilson, 1997; Leman, 1997; Meyers, 1992; the programs them\u00adselves (Eytan, Bischoff, and Loutan, 1999), or described the status of interpreter services generally (James, 1998; Woloshin et al., 1995). Patient Comprehension Spanish-speaking patients tended to have poorer comprehension than English speakers. Crane (1997) found that Spanish-speaking patients had poorer understanding of diagnoses and prescribed medication than En\u00ad glish-speaking ones. David and Rhee (1998) found that Spanish speakers reported that side effects of medication were not explained, which was correlated with lower adherence rates. Baker and colleagues (1996) demonstrated that not having an interpreter when one was needed has an effect on a patient's perceived understanding of diagnosis and treatment. Those who needed an interpreter and had one provided rated their understanding of treatment and diagnosis slightly lower than those who did not need an interpreter, but much higher than those who needed an interpreter and did not receive one. It is important to note that responses in the Baker study were affected by the fact that few of the interpreters used had any formal training in interpretation. Cooke and colleagues (2000) described the difficulty of using basic medical terms such as \"unconscious\" with both English and non-English-speaking populations. They pointed out that ethnicity and primary lan\u00ad guage have an impact on understanding such terms that may affect clinical diagnosis. Patient Satisfaction/Perceptions of Care Of the studies comparing satisfaction between English-speaking patients and non-English speaking patients, language barriers consistently have a negative impact on patient satisfaction with health-care encounters. Carrasquillo and colleagues (1999) noted that non-English-speaking patients who visit the emergency (ED) reported more overall problems with care, communication, and testing. Kirkman-Liff and Mondragon (1991) found that language of interview had a significant impact on satisfaction for Hispanic children, although not for adults. Morales and Cunningham (1999) found that Latino Spanish-speaking patients were significantly more dissatisfied with provider communication than Latino English-speaking and white patients. Hu and Covell (1986) found that patients whose primary language was English were more satisfied with care than Spanish-speaking patients. Baker, Hayes, and Fortier (1998) found that patients who needed and did not receive interpreter services were less satisfied with the patient-provider relationship. Xuo and Fagan (1999) examined varying levels of satisfaction of medical residents and Spanish-speaking patients with various methods of interpretation, and found that both patients and residents were happiest with professional interpreters; patients were more satisfied than residents using family members and friends, 120 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE APPENDIX TWO: LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE LITERATURE although both groups agreed that accuracy, accessibility and confidentiality were important characteristics of professional interpreters. Utilization of Health Services and Costs Several researchers looked at the impact of language barriers on utilization of services. In general, they found that when language barriers existed, patients received fewer services. Woloshin and colleagues (1997) found that French-speaking women in Canada received fewer preventive health services. Derose and Baker (2000) found that Latinos with fair-to-poor English had fewer physician visits, although the likelihood of having a visit was unrelated to English proficiency. In contrast, Hu and Covell (1986) found that use of health services correlated to a higher degree of English proficiency. Schur and Albers (1996) found that Spanish- speakers were less likely than English-speaking Hispanics to have a usual source of care. Carrasquillo and colleagues (1999) found that non-English speaking patients were significantly less likely to return to the same emergency department (ED), although Enguidanos and Rosen (1997) found language not to have an effect on keeping ED follow-up appointments. Researchers have also studied the impact of interpreter use on utilization of services, with reviews of the literature suggesting that interpreters increase access (Dias and O'Neill, 1998). In two studies led by Jacobs (Jacobs, Lauderdale, and Meltzer, 2001; Jacobs et al., 2001), and in Lee and Pope's study (2001), research\u00aders found that the introduction of interpreters led to greater usage of preventive and primary care services. Bernstein and colleagues (2000) found that patients without interpreters who needed one received fewer services than those with an interpreter or those who did not need one. Lee and Rosenberg (1998) found that the risk of admission from the ED was greater for those without interpreters and decreased for those who had one. Sarver and Baker (2000) found patients with language barriers were less likely to receive follow- up appointments from the ED than English speakers, regardless of whether or not an interpreter was present. Tocher and Larson (1999), Kravitz and colleagues (2000), Drennan (1996), and Hampers and associates (Hampers and McNulty, 2002; Hampers and colleagues 1999) looked at the impact of interpreter use on clinical processes, which has implications on cost. Tocher and Larson (1999) found that having an inter\u00ad preter did not increase the length of the visit, while Kravitz and colleagues found the exact opposite. Drennan calculated the opportunity costs of using nursing and cleaning staff as interpreters, and found the financial costs small but the impact on working conditions and patient care considerable. Drennan also found that interviews involving a professional interpreter were longer than those utilizing ad hoc interpreters. Two studies by Hampers found that more diagnostic tests were used on patients with language barriers who did not have an interpreter than English-speaking patients, resulting in higher charges. When interpreter services were provided to patients with language barriers, they were no more likely to under diagnostic tests, resulting in a 15 percent reduction in mean costs for diagnostic testing. However, these patients had longer stays in the ED than English-speaking patients. In contrast, Bernstein and colleagues (2000) found that patients who do not receive interpreter services received fewer tests and had shorter ED stays than patients who received interpreter services or spoke English. Health Outcomes One study examined the effect of providing professional interpreters to non-English-speaking patients with Type 2 diabetes. Although the literature would predict worse outcomes for non-English-speaking patients as compared to English-speaking patients, Tocher and Larson (1998) found that outcomes for non-English\u00ad speaking patients , including standardized glycohemoglobin and other laboratory results as well as complica\u00ad tion rates, were as good or better as outcomes for English-speaking patients. SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 121 APPENDIX TWO: LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE LITERATURE Patient-Provider Communication Rivadeneyra and colleagues (2000) found that Spanish-speaking patients using an interpreter made fewer comments to providers in medical encounters, and the ones that did comment were more likely to be ignored by providers than English-speaking patients. Erzinger (1991), using ethnographic and conversational analysis methods to investigate the impact of family practice residents with a range of Spanish-language skills, found that conversational style (active listener v. persistent explainer or abrupt interrupter) had as much impact on the communication as did Spanish lan\u00ad guage proficiency. Wardin (1996) found that compared to English-speaking patients, providers understood the needs of limited- English-proficiency clients less well, and that better understanding of needs was associated with higher levels of English proficiency. Quality of Interpretation Flores and colleagues' study (2003) showed errors in medical interpretation are common, and those commit\u00ad ted by ad hoc interpreters are significantly more likely to have potential clinical consequences than those committed by hospital interpreters. Xuo and Fagan's study (1999) comparing the use of professional and family interpreters has implications for quality based on perceived satisfaction, but is limited by the caveats mentioned regarding the relationship between satisfaction and quality. Marcos' analysis (1979) of inter\u00adpreter-mediated psychiatric interviews suggested that clinically relevant interpreter-related distortions could lead to inaccurate evaluations of a patient's mental status, but noted that pre- and post-interview meetings of clinicians and interpreters can minimize these distortions. Although few studies compared the impact of using different modes of interpretation, Hornberger and colleagues (1996) documented improvements in the number of physician-patient utterances, quality of interpretation and satisfaction when remote-simultaneous interpretation is used compared to proximate (on-site) consecutive interpretation. Bilingual Providers Two studies examined the impact of bilingual providers on mental health treatment rates. Manson (1988) found that Spanish-speaking patients who saw Spanish-speaking physicians were less likely to omit medica\u00ad tion, less likely to miss office appointment, and were slightly less likely to make an emergency room visit than Spanish-speaking patients who saw English-speaking physicians. Flaskerud and Liu (1991), found that while client-therapist language match significantly increased the number of client sessions with the primary therapist, it did not effect on dropout rate or improve health status. A third study (Hampers and McNulty, 2002) found that emergency department resource utilization for Spanish-speaking patients treated by bilin\u00ad gual physicians was the same as for English-speaking patients. Other Spanish-speaking patients who did not receive interpreter services had higher resource utilization, while other Spanish-speaking patients who did receive interpreter services had comparable resource utilization except they had longer stays in the emer\u00ad gency room. Second-Language Acquisition by Providers Both Binder and colleagues (1988) and Mazor and colleagues (2002) found that physicians receiving Span\u00ad ish language instruction made gains in their ability to communicate with patients. Mazor found that physi\u00ad cians were more likely to obtain key elements of the patient's history without the use of an interpreter in mock scenarios; that they were less likely to use interpreters; and families felt that physicians were con\u00adcerned about their children, made them feel comfortable, were respectful, and listened to what they said. 122 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE APPENDIX TWO: LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE LITERATURE Translation Note: A formal literature search for was not undertaken for this topic. Jackson and colleagues's study (1997) of Khmer words for liver disease suggest the difficulty and complex\u00ad ity of attempting to render Western medical concepts into other languages and cultural contexts. Twinn (1997) examined the influence of translation on the reliability and validity of qualitative research involving Cantonese-speaking subjects. Analysis of English transcripts produced by two different translators and one Chinese transcript produced no significant differences in major categories generated, but minor differences were identified in the themes. Research Considerations Because there is no universal definition of interpreter qualifications at this time, simply applying the term interpreter to anyone who provides interpretation services can be a confounding variable on the impact of other outcomes being studied. Professional interpreters are in the process of developing training and certifi\u00adcation standards for medical interpreters. However, their work is experientially and not research based. Significantly more research needs to be done on comparing the quality and effect of using different modes of interpretation, and the effect of different methods and levels of intensity of interpreter training. Work is especially needed on quality with respect to the multidimensional communication process involved in mental health encounters. To further research in this area, reliable and valid tools for measuring satisfaction for non-English speakers are necessary. Hayes and Baker (1998) found that the Spanish translation of a satisfaction instrument performed more poorly than the English version. In conducting research on the effect of language assis\u00adtance on satisfaction, questions involving whether patient satisfaction is a valid indicator of quality will emerge. Most non-English speakers, as well as clinicians, are unable to discern whether important medical information is being accurately communicated to or from the provider when nonprofessional interpreters are used. The consequences of inaccuracy in interpretation are more severe than a lower level of satisfaction. The inability of providers and patients to determine the accuracy and adequacy of communication also has implications for evaluating the success of second-language acquisition as a strategy to serve LEP individuals. Research questions that arise from the literature include: What is the relationship between satisfaction and the use of trained, professional interpreters vs. untrained staff or family member interpreters? Does satisfaction increase when patients are provided with a pre-encounter explanation of the professional interpreter's training, method of interpreting, and ethical standards, and/or when interpreters physically place themselves in the encounter in such a way that providers and patients can look at each other directly during the encounter? Do some institutions behave in a more cautious manner when language barriers are present, ordering more tests and admissions to compensate for not being able to communicate adequately? Do other institutions behave in a more dismissive manner, assuming that patients will return if the problem gets worse, or won't bother to sue if adequate care is not rendered? What length and intensity of training is necessary to produce second-language-speaking clini\u00ad cians who use that language to establish rapport vs. being able to conduct complicated medical encounters? Does translated signage improve patient movement through health care facilities? SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 123 APPENDIX TWO: LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE LITERATURE Do translated written pre-op instructions lead to fewer reschedulings for procedures because of inappropriate patient preparation? Does translated prescription information/instructions lead to fewer patient medication errors/ better compliance? Are verbal (interpreted) instructions more effective than translated written materials for certain patient groups (by age, ethnicity, or education)? Do verbatim translated consent forms vs. summarized consent forms lead to different choices about undertaking high risk procedures? Do translated health insurance member materials lead to more appropriate patient utilization of services (i.e., fewer emergency room visits for non-urgent conditions)? 124 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE APPENDIX Eytan A, Bischoff A, Loutan L To describe the employment of \u008a 94% acknowledged difficulties Survey (1999) interpreters in psychiatric services in communicating with patients in Switzerland who did not speak or spoke Study Participants: poorly the local language.

SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE 141 APPENDIX TWO: ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTS IV. C ATEGORY C: O RGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTS FOR CULTURAL COMPETENCE Little research specifically examines the processes and outcomes of organizational supports for cultural competence, although progress has been made in developing a conceptual framework that can be used to provide a foundation for research efforts. Specific literature searches were not undertaken for all catego\u00ad ries of organizational supports. (See Appendix One for the list of search terms used.) The discussion of the literature separates groups of organizational interventions for which literature was found. For a discussion of community involvement, see Category A: Family/Community Inclusion . Management, Policy and Implementation Strategies to Institutionalize Cultural Competence Activities Several articles, focusing on the incorporation of a traditional system into a mainstream mental health sys\u00ad tem, primarily describe different approaches to implementing cultural competence activities in an organiza\u00ad tion, with very little analysis 2000). Del Castillo (1999) and Agger-Gupta (2001), focusing on implementation of interpreter services in a variety of different health care organizations, both conducted dissertation research examining a variety of different factors and forces that led to success\u00adful and unsuccessful implementation of cultural competence interventions. Two studies found that health care organization policies could be crafted and improved upon when information on program needs and performance is gathered (Giacomelli, 1997; Stolk et al., 1998). One descriptive article (Johnson and Baboila, 1996) was found on developing a cross-cultural health infor\u00ad mation system to support providers and patients with information about the cultural beliefs and practices of different ethnic communities. Design and Use of Surveys and Profile Instruments to Plan for Services and Measure Satisfaction and Quality As noted by Frayne and colleagues (1996), medical research often excludes people who do not speak English. Lack of research instruments that are valid and reliable with various language and cultural groups is frequently blamed. The research in this area includes reports on the testing of tools to see if they are valid and reliable, and the use of quantitative and qualitative methods to gather relevant cultural information for the purposes of survey design, pilot testing and modification of tools (Hartweg and Berbiglia, 1996; Hayes and Baker, 1998; et 1999; Resick et al., 1997; Simpson et al., 1994; Stanton et al., 1995). 142 SETTING THE AGENDA FOR RESEARCH ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE APPENDIX TWO: ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTS Other Organizational/Administrative Supports Not Part of this Literature Review Cultural Competence Self Assessments There are a number of assessment tools for health care organizations to gauge where they are on the cultural competence continuum (Paez, 2002). No studies of the impact of cultural competence assessment could be located, but one on-going study is examining feasibility and effectiveness of implementing cultural competency assessment and training for providers as part of a systems approach to deal with culturally competent health care in a managed care setting (Dimas, 2003). Culturally Appropriate Ethics, Conflict, and Grievance Resolution Processes More descriptive studies are needed about the kinds of cultural issues that arise in clinical ethics, conflict, or grievance situations. Research by Kauffert and associates (1984; 1998) suggests that even well-trained interpreters who are familiar with professional standards of conduct encounter difficult cultural and ethical conflicts in the context of dealing with complex clinical situations. These situations may arise around truth- telling related to terminal diagnoses (unacceptable in many cultures). Studies are also needed on how best to prepare staff for dealing with these situations in a way that minimizes the danger to clinician-provider trust, and what institutional policies work best to support staff and patients, especially in environments where many cultures are being served. Research Considerations In general, considerably more information is needed to document the step-by-step processes of implement\u00ad ing organizational cultural competence interventions, as well as evaluations of what processes are more successful than others. Further work investigating the barriers and supports for successful implementation programs is also necessary. Researchers should also look at whether the existence of explicit plans and strategies for implementation of cultural competence interventions facilitates and improves the delivery of those services over an ad hoc approach. Are there any organizational preconditions or critically necessary management or policy compo\u00ad nents required to accomplish outcomes? More work is needed to determine whether the existence of such information systems results in beneficial utilization by providers and patients, and whether this information is incorporated into practice or behavior change. Process-related considerations include best practices in providing information about cross-cultural health care and cultural competence issues for everyday use by providers and staff. It would be useful to investigate what level of community input, data gathering and testing is necessary to develop valid tools for information gathering, as many health care organizations have neither the time nor resources to engage in complex survey development processes for the purposes of service planning and design. The related question would investigate what kinds of information organizations need in order to develop culturally appropriate programs and systems. Finally, there is the issue of developing valid tools to gather information on patient satisfaction within programs, given the difficulty of reliably measuring satisfaction across ethnic groups.
