What is Naturopathic Medicine? Naturopathic medicine is a healing system that uses natural remedies to help the body heal itself. This includes therapies like herbs, massage, acupuncture, exercise and nutritional advice. The goal of naturopathic medicine is to treat the whole person. This includes their mind, body, and spirit. It also aims to heal the root cause of an illness, not just stop the symptoms you see at first. Naturopathic Medicine focuses on education and prevention. This means that your doctor will most likely offer you diet, exercise & stress management advice. They might also use complementary medicine such as homeopathy, herbal medicine, and acupuncture in addition to naturopathy. They can also use touch to create balance in your body. This is called naturopathic manipulative therapy. At our practice, we provide customized evidence-based treatments that balance the least harmful and most effective approaches in order to help facilitate the body's inherent ability to restore and maintain optimal health. What are the benefits of Naturopathic Medicine? Naturopathy has been on the rise as a holistic form of health care that appeals to a lot of people for a variety of reasons. It can be used as a standalone treatment or alongside traditional healthcare. Here are all the benefits you might enjoy from naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic medicine focuses heavily on prevention. This means that an ND will work with patients to identify the diet and lifestyle that is best for them, tailored to their individual health concerns and conditions. Patients who see naturopathic doctors learn a lot and develop a close relationship with them. It's not just about having someone to do your appointments for you, it's about building an understanding of the whole person and making sure their physical and mental health are in line. A naturopathic doctor's job is not just to treat people, but to educate them as well. This way, the patient will have a better understanding of what treatment and prevention work and how they can take more responsibility for their own health. Naturopathic medical approaches are different to that of conventional medicine since they are more invasive. The naturopathic approach is that \"first, do no harm\", which means the medical treatment will focus on less invasive approaches. Many naturopathic remedies involve dietary and lifestyle changes, herbal supplements, and other gentle treatments that are safe to use alone or in conjunction with conventional medical approaches. It's important to work with a licensed naturopath to get the right treatment. Is Naturopathic Medicine right for you? Do you find yourself consuming different pills to manage your various health concerns? Have you considered changing this for an alternative that can improve your well-being? Have you been thinking about making lifestyle changes but don't know where to start? Naturopathic medicine may provide some relief for your symptoms. Naturopathic medicine will help to tackle your medical condition and encourage the body's natural healing process. Used on its own or alongside other forms of treatment, it can positively affect your recovery. Naturopathic medicine is an approach to health and wellness that starts with the belief in interconnected body health. It focuses on treating you as an individual and not just focusing on specific ailments. Naturopathic medicine takes a proactive approach to health care. They emphasize the importance of prevention like showing how stress is linked to illness. They also teach lifelong coping skills.

The primary difference is in the length and quality of education. Naturopathic doctors complete accredited naturopathic programs typically lasting 4 years following their 4 year undergraduate education. Naturopaths receive education ranging from several weeks to 1 year while some are self taught. Another important distinction is that Naturopathic Doctors that have gone through and completed a program at an accredited Naturopathic Medicine college have the potential to hold a license with the state in which they practice. Currently 24 states and 2 US territories license Naturopathic Doctors. \"In some states with laws regulating naturopathic doctors, the use of the term \"naturopath\" or \"naturopathic physician\" by anyone other than a licensed naturopathic doctor is prohibited. However, not all states regulate naturopathic doctors and not all states that do protect the term \"naturopath.\" Unlicensed naturopaths can have varied levels of education and experience, often from a purely online or correspondence format. Such education is not accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and does not qualify students to take the NPLEX examination or apply for licensure in any regulated jurisdiction in North America\" (https://naturopathic.org/page/FAQ). There is a significant difference between the supplements we offer here at Natural Healthcare and those found on the internet. We offer provider only supplements with high purity, high potency, and traceability. We purchase all of our supplements directly from highly reputable suppliers. Many supplements found on the internet have the potential to be fraudulent in either what they contain or in the quantity of ingredients found in the product. Some supplements may even be counterfeits of reputable brands that contain little or no active ingredients. The links below are 2 articles detailing issues with counterfeit supplements found on internet platforms, such as Amazon. https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-fake-supplements/ https://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/view/combating-counterfeiting-in-the-dietary-supplements-industry Why choose Natural Healthcare Chiropractic as your healthcare provider?
