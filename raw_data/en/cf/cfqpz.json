The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/activities/coordinating-r-and-d-on-antimicrobial-resistance) has more information on the state of the global antibiotic pipeline. Editor's note: On April 5, 2021, this piece was updated to change the drug type of KB109 from \"live biotherapeutic product\" to \"synthetic polymer.\" As of December 2020, an estimated 36 new nontraditional products with the potential to treat or prevent serious bacterial infections were in clinical development.

Such nontraditional approaches encompass a variety of products.

Note: The following drugs have been removed from the pipeline. Removed candidates will be included in future updates if development resumes: - June 2019: S. pneumoniae next generation vaccine (GSK-2189241A) was discontinued, according to a press release from the company. - December 2018: SA4Ag was removed because development was discontinued, according to a press release from the company. - June 2018: ASN100, GEN 004, Group B Streptococcus vaccine, and VLA84 (IC84) were removed because they were no longer included in the research and development pipeline on the company's website. - September 2017: Shigamab and Cdiffense were removed because they were no longer included in the research and development pipeline on the company's website.

Drug-resistant bacteria, or superbugs, present a serious and worsening threat to human health. A majority of doctors have encountered patients with infections that do not respond to available treatments, and when new drugs come to market bacteria can quickly develop resistance. According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2 million Americans acquire serious infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year, and at least 23,000 die as a result. A sustained and robust pipeline of new antibacterial drugs and novel therapies is critical to ensure that new interventions keep pace with these evolving pathogens.
