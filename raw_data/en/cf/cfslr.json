Though I must say I have renewed respect for Senators Manchin (W. Virginia), Jones (Alabama), and Romney (Utah) as it would have been much safer to shrink down to the safe option of voting against impeachment. Bravo Nancy, if I thought one person in a hundred would believe me, I'd swear she was my sister. History will applaud her gumption. To add to these well founded critical observations, It's pitifully ironic how little those who support Trump understand what the long term result of his policies will be. Tonight in the SOTU he will loudly trumpet the \"strong\" economy and Republicans will shower him with applause while at the same time knowing full well that his actions will literally insure our national debt will have to be monetized. Most of the people who voted for him have no idea what that means. It means the federal reserve will just print more money and more government bonds because they're only paper with fancy writing and this means inflation and lots of it. Prices generally speaking don't go up so much as the perceived value of the dollar goes down. I once heard an economist say that and increased money supply that causes a 10 percent rise in inflation has the potential to erase about one trillion dollars of debt. At that rate it would take a 250 percent rise in inflation to totally eliminate our national debt because the debt will be 25 trillion by the time this incompetent impostor leaves office. That means that poor Alabama mother who voted for Trump will have to pay $10.50 for a loaf of bread she currently pays $3.00 to purchase. Of course this will be done gradually and it will never be voted on or likely even discussed by Republicans. The only problem republicans will need to consider is how to plausibly or even implausibly blame it on Hillary or Obama. Monetizing the debt (AND IT WILL BE MONETIZED) won't affect the rich, a ten dollar loaf of bread means nothing to them. The burden will be on the poor and working class, the very same people who are so proud to wear their MAGA hats. The problem is all Americans will feel the loss of purchasing power and yet not one Democratic candidate is talking about this looming threat to our national economy. I don't get it.January 20, 2020 at 15:54 in reply to: [Walmart and more New Age Medicine.](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/walmart-and-more-new-age-medicine/) [#319492](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/walmart-and-more-new-age-medicine/#post-319492) I've listened to Deepak Chopra speak a number of times and never heard him once advise telling a doctor about dreams. What exactly is \"Deepak Chopra crap\"? Lumping herbal supplements and the word \"crap\" is indicative of a woefully uninformed intellect. The science corroborating the efficacy of plant based extracts in treating disease is rock solid. Nutritional science is valid and increasing at a faster pace than traditional medical science.January 19, 2020 at 17:55 in reply to: [No alternatve medicine](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/no-alternatve-medicine/) [#319414](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/no-alternatve-medicine/#post-319414) In response to Mr. Widdershin, I don't know anyone in their right mind who would ever advise the ingestion of chlorine (bleach) which is deadly to all forms of life but to take the example of autism or other neurological conditions a good idea might be to begin a program using agents that slowly pull heavy metals from a child's body like the high levels of copper found in children with behavioral problems, agents that abound in nature like chlorella, medicinal mushrooms, tumeric, milk thistle, resveratrol, olive leaf extract, oil of oregano, and dozens and dozens more plant based extracts that have been clearly shown to halt and reverse disease conditions. I treated my own case of Squamous cell carcinoma and have the before and after pictures to prove how effective natural agents can be. I service pools and one day while pouring acid into one , a drop of muriatic acid splashed on my face beneath my eye. I remembered it clearly. Within 6 months a squamous cell carcinoma bud emerged in the same spot because the acid , a single drop of it that landed there months before had the effect of turning the underlying tissues acidic and that is an open invitation to cancer. I was servicing another pool afterward and the homeowner (a doctor) became alarmed when he saw it and instantly knew what it was. I told him I was not concerned and he though I was being very foolish. For some time I didn't bother with it because I knew my diet being nearly pristine and including a wide variety of plant based supplements would not permit metastasis yet it would also not be enough to eradicate the carcinoma. I treated it with a product called curaderm 44 and within 6 weeks it completely disappeared and to this day over 4 years later it's still gone. I showed the before and after pictures to the doctor who urged me to get treatment and he was dumbfounded. He still is. Many stories of this type have occurred (google \"The Incurables\") I have enormous respect for what modern medicine can do especially diagnostic and trauma medicine. Hospitals and their working medical teams save live lives everyday in this country, but allopathic medicine is way behind the learning curve in the ever advancing field of nutritional science. The National Institute of Health maintains a free to the public website that posts every accredited study on every accepted form of therapy including nutritional. It's no mystery why plant based organic compounds are effective in treating certain conditions. Humans and our prehuman ancestors co-evolved with plants for hundreds of millions of years. Our gut bacteria is exhibit A. All who suffer from chronic degenerative conditions should fully utilize nature's powerful store of plant based compounds to first enhance, repair and fully potentiate their indolent immune systems. It's easy to poke fun at \"snake oil salesmen\" and they are a fraudulent side show but that's just half of the story and by far the least important half. As always I thank the Center for Inquiry for enabling my views to be expressed on this valuable First Amendment platform.January 18, 2020 at 10:12 in reply to: [Genesis Creation v.

For decades skeptics posited the same idea that a \"missing link\" as they called it should establish a lineal connection. \"Lucy\" the name given to a female hominid with clear anatomical connections to modern man was discovered in Africa and clearly shows an unambiguous link. Anthropology has painstakingly amassed an enormous amount of evidence that fully and directly corroborates the inescapable conclusion that we are all evolved from simpler, more primitive forms of life. Your intellectual belief in God is valid and well grounded but not by anything from the bible. Science offers far more compelling evidence for the existence of God than the bible. The bible is poison to the human mind.January 16, 2020 at 14:52 in reply to: [T rump has shown us that we can assassinate oppositional foreign leaders](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/t-rump-has-shown-us-that-we-can-assassinate-oppositional-foreign-leaders/) [#319130](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/t-rump-has-shown-us-that-we-can-assassinate-oppositional-foreign-leaders/page/9/#post-319130) In response to Mr. Lausten's comment on deer populations. Lausten's comments are 100 percent accurate. There is no comparison between those in rural or mountainous areas like Appalachia who occasionally kill deer to supplement their food supply and those who spend thousands like the two whelps whose father occupies the White House who murder endangered animals in foreign countries with corrupt governments. A century ago lion populations were about one million. Today they number less than 20 thousand. I swear by all that's honorable if I could push an invisible button that would make every lion murderer disappear from this world I'd push that button and keep pushing it until I expelled my last living breath. I know this comment might be better placed in a different subject category but I had to voice my opinion on this.January 16, 2020 at 09:19 in reply to: [Worst Commander in Chief Ever?](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/worst-commander-in-chief-ever/) [#319109](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/worst-commander-in-chief-ever/page/5/#post-319109) Well said Tim,January 15, 2020 at 16:55 in reply to: [Worst Commander in Chief Ever?](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/worst-commander-in-chief-ever/) [#319002](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/worst-commander-in-chief-ever/page/5/#post-319002) This forum is part of the answer. Every time someone reads a well considered rationale posted on this site explaining why Trumpism is so dangerous to this country and the world civilization is pushing back even if incrementally on the barbarism and tribal ignorance espoused by Trump. It should be the job of those candidates seeking to displace him and maybe it will come to that but thus far their words seem tepid. In a very real sense, every time a contributor writes and reasons with clarity on this valuable 1st Amendment platform progress is made. If a man walking in the night sees his neighbors barn starting to burn and rings the warning bell over and over again outside his neighbors window but fails to wake him because he most likely went to bed drunk again, he has done all he can do and all he can be reasonably expected to do. What more can he do? Mr. Lausten it's good to read your comments. I value the challenging encounters I've had with your keen intelligence.January 15, 2020 at 09:55 in reply to: [Worst Commander in Chief Ever?](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/worst-commander-in-chief-ever/) [#318960](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/worst-commander-in-chief-ever/page/5/#post-318960) PBS's Frontline aired for the last two nights an in depth profile of Barack Obama and the current specimen in the White House called The Great Divide. In an attempt to explain how our nation has become so bitterly polarized two hours were spent on the prior administration and two hours on the current \"administration.\" There has never been such a starkly contrasting look at the personalities of two men who've become president. After watching this incisive presentation I come away with an even greater respect for Barack Obama and his genuine desire to help this nation heal its self-inflicted wounds. Considering what he inherited from the war criminal who preceded him, and how he was treated by the corrupt Republican Party, Barack Obama should and eventually will be ranked highly for his performance. Then the spotlight was focused on the present occupant of the Oval Office. The difference in men couldn't be more extreme. Seeing Donald Trump and his supporters was a very depressing reminder of the racism, violently intolerant bigotry, and general ignorance of those who fervently support him. I've always avoided comparisons to Nazi Germany in the 1930's and 40's thinking they might be needlessly inflammatory, but I now believe that's the closest and certainly the most accurate historical analogue to what's presently happening in our country. In this American version of the \"cult of personality\" old themes and features of authoritarianism are seen and willfully employed by Donald Trump. I noticed when he gives a speech to the gullible masses he'll occasionally stop, walk a few steps from the podium, look out into the crowd and drink in the enormous adulation. For a malignant narcissist this is like gasoline poured on a fire and for our democracy something very, very dangerous. Exploiting divisions and turning one group against another is a common tactic of demagogues and Donald Trump is masterful at this. His skillful use of hate as a political tool is on display every time he speaks. Adolph Hitler did exactly the same thing. Watching this revealing PBS program called \"The Great Divide\" was sobering and not very reassuring. Our nation is in trouble.January 14, 2020 at 10:09 in reply to: [the dark side of \"saint\" Mother Teresa](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/the-dark-side-of-saint-mother-teresa/) [#318796](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/the-dark-side-of-saint-mother-teresa/#post-318796) This disgusting abuse has been happening for decades and centuries and many in the Catholic Church in positions of authority could've done something about it, instead they ignored the crimes of their fellow priests. What makes this abuse particularly venal is these pedophiles were and incredibly in some cases still are looked up to by parishioners. In places like Latin America and certain parts of Africa Catholic priests are seen as icons of truth and purveyors of spiritual enlightenment because backward, uninformed populations are slavish adherents to their stale doctrines and superstitious customs. There are those who by the twisted psychology of their own perverted mind set desire sexual contact with children but they at least know they're demented and can't seem to help themselves but a pedophile in the Catholic Church is protected even admired and respected by \"good Catholics\" who have learned to keep quiet about such things. The pervert who knows he behaves in disgusting ways and stays furtive and quiet is far less offensive than the priest who is accustomed to being shown respect and deference. There's a huge difference between a businessman who falls into having an affair with his secretary and a preacher at the local church who's screwing his female parishioners. One example is an expression of basic human weakness, but the other is the most repulsive form of hypocrisy. That's why my condemnation of this behavior is so harsh. An individuals genuine belief in God is normal and completely natural. Expressing that belief in a socialized group setting through the stale customs and traditions of organized religion is where problems arise.January 12, 2020 at 14:58 in reply to: [the dark side of \"saint\" Mother Teresa](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/the-dark-side-of-saint-mother-teresa/) [#318718](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/the-dark-side-of-saint-mother-teresa/#post-318718) The Catholic Church is one of the most corrupt institutions on the planet encouraging high birth rates where ever it's ensconced. It loves to see every 15 year old girl with a swelling tummy and that's because it just loves little children, especially plump little boys, yummy, yummy yummy. When Catholic Churches are turned into movie theaters this world will be a better place to live.January 12, 2020 at 11:43 in reply to: [Prediction: be President](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/prediction-hrc-will-be-president/) response to citizenchallenge, You've described the problem succinctly. Most people are intellectually lazy and simply don't want to be challenged to think in new ways. I listen to Cspan every morning during their call in segment and it's often very depressing. Though I believe the program is biased in favor of brain dead conservatives, it still reflects a strong national tendency in this country to blindly ignore the mounting evidence of what will prove to be the most devastating environmental collapse in human history. As far as climate change or more accurately rapid global warming is concerned; it's too late. It's simply too late. Does anyone with more than 50 or 60 working brain cells actually think we can double the amount of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere and not be affected by such a radical change? When huge parts of the U.S. looks like Australia every summer maybe those millions of dumb Americans will finally get the connection. Here's another little sweet surprise the climate tooth fairy is about to leave under our pillow; waiting in the wings for the right time and that time is almost here is the awesome and irresistible power of microbial life. Microbes own this world not vertebrates though our eyes may lead us to think otherwise. This nascent force is now awakening and will express itself in the 21st century through the emergence of super plagues that will kill hundreds of millions. If anyone thinks that medical science will be enough to protect humanity from this coming threat they simply don't understand the deadly power of microbial life. A warmer and wetter world favors the smallest forms of life on planet earth and they won't be shy in teaching humanity a harsh lesson. It's simply too late, but who cares? As long as there's another football game to watch or another episode of \"America's got Talent\" and besides we won't be around to witness the apocalypse, so I guess we can all gas up the two and a half ton SUV and have fun.January 11, 2020 at 17:58 in reply to: [#318629](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/no-alternatve-medicine/#post-318629) I don't know what \"alternative medicine\" is but if the statement is made that integrative medicine that incorporates the wide use of natural agents found primarily in plants has not been proven then those holding such views are uninformed. Go to pubmed.gov and you'll find hundreds and hundreds of accredited studies (not surveys) validating the efficacy of plant based extracts that have been clearly shown to ameliorate a wide variety of human ailments.January 11, 2020 at 14:53 in reply to: [Prediction: HRC will be President](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/prediction-hrc-will-be-president/) [#318621](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/prediction-hrc-will-be-president/page/3/#post-318621) Every time I see or hear the fat impostor in the White House, I say to myself \"thanks a lot Hillary\" you could've saved us all from this national ignominy but instead you played it safe. I voted for you Hillary and if the contest were repeated would do so again. It was Hillary's to lose and that's what she did. Did anyone hear a single passionate or even convincing endorsement for green energy from Mrs Clinton? I didn't. Why is it that she never campaigned in the important state of Michigan? Could it be that Bill (who I voted for twice) told her not to bother because minority voters would show up in droves to support her? \"Don't you remember honey? They called me the first black president?\" How persuasive was it to hear her explanation for voting to authorize an utter incompetent and reckless George Bush to go to war in Iraq by saying it was just a \"mistake\"? A mistake is when you take the wrong exit of the turnpike, a mistake is when you forget to sign the check paying your electric bill. A vote giving the likes of George Bush a pass on waging war is not a mistake. It's a serous breach of judgement that proved catastrophic. Does anyone recall that Oval office photograph when Hillary and now war criminal George Bush gave each other a warm and extended hug in the White House, a photograph suggesting to anyone who sees it that there's no difference between the two respective heads of the Republican and Democratic parties? Does any one remember what her first response was as she heard the news that Khadaffi Libya's long ruling dictator had just been slaughtered? I do. Verbatim it was \"We came, He saw, He died, Ha Ha.\" She said this while the cameras were rolling knowing it would be heard by all. Everyone did hear it including the North Korean dictator that now proves so threatening and intransigent. No we don't need Hillary to run again. The time has come for this nation to elect enlightened and progressive liberals to administer government policies. Hillary Clinton isn't one of them.January 11, 2020 at 12:03 in reply to: [Psychedelic Medicine](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/19944/) [#318607](https://centerforinquiry.org/forums/topic/19944/#post-318607) What an interesting and vitally important subject. Thank you citizenchallenge for commenting on this topic. There is no doubt that the use of psychedelic therapy will become mainstream policy in the future. This approach has been proven to be effective. In the late 1950's in Western Canada a government sponsored program to treat alcoholism was established using LSD as the primary agent of therapy. The results were stunning, 75 percent of patients undergoing this novel form of treatment were cured of this crippling addiction, a phenomenally high rate of success. Follow up studies confirmed they were still alcohol free after one year. A DVD was made called \"Hoffman's Potion\" (commercially available) documented the story. Psychedelic therapy holds the potential for treating a number psychological conditions including opioid addiction, depression, PTSD, rape trauma and more. The reason this promising form of therapy is not practiced is because doctors, pharmaceutical corporations and dumb ass conservatives in congress who take their bribes to keep this form of therapy suppressed care more about lining their pockets then relieving the suffering of those who would benefit from using these miraculous natural agents. I've ingested LSD and other psychedelics hundreds of times and have benefited immensely from the "}
