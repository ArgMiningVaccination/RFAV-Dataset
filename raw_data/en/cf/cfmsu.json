Code 1302, Regulations Governing Hazardous Waste 2020 DRGHW Final Amendmen ts Page 2 of 214 December 2020 Section 122.1 Purpose and scope of Part 122. (a) Coverage. (1) These permit regulations establish provisions for Delaware's Hazardous Waste Permit Program. (2) The regulations in this part cover basic DNREC permitting requirements, such as application requirements, standard permit conditions, and monitoring and reporting requirements. (3)Technical regulations. The RCRA (state hazardous waste) permit program has separate additional regulations that contain technical requirements. These separate regulations are used by DNREC to determine what requirements must be placed in permits if they are issued. These separate regulations are located in Parts 264, 266, and 268 of these regulations. (b) [Reserved] (c) Scope of the hazardous waste permit requirement. DNREC requires a permit for the \"treatment\", \"storage\", and \"disposal\" of any \"hazardous waste\" as identified or listed in Part 261. The terms \"treatment\", \"storage\", \"disposal\", and \"hazardous waste\" are defined in Section 122.2. Owners and operators of hazardous waste management units must have permits during the active life (including the closure period) of the unit. Owners or operators of surface impoundments , landfills, land treatment units, and waste pile units that received wastes after July 26, 1982, or that certified closure (according to Section 265.115) after January 26, 1983, must have post-closure permits, unless they demonstrate closure by removal or decontamination as provided under Section 122.1(c)(5) and (6), or obtain an enforceable document in lieu of a post-closure permit, as required under (c)(7) of this section. If a post- closure permit is required, the permit must address applicable Part 264 groundwater monitoring, unsaturated zone monitoring, corrective action, and post-closure care requirements of these regulations. The denial of a permit for the active life of a hazardous waste management facility or unit does not affect the requirement to obtain a post-closure permit under this section. (1) Specific inclusions. Owners and operators of certain facilities require hazardous waste permits as well as permits under other programs for certain aspects of the facility operation. Hazardous waste permits are required for: (i) [Reserved] (ii) Treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste at facilities requiring an NPDES permit. However, the owner and operator of a publicly owned treatment works receiving hazardous waste will be deemed to have a hazardous waste permit for that waste if they comply with the requirements of Section 122.60(c) (permit -by-rule for POTWs). (iii) Barges or vessels that dispose of hazardous waste by ocean disposal and onshore hazardous waste treatment or storage facilities associated with an ocean disposal operation. However, the owner and operator will be deemed to have a State permit for ocean disposal from the barge or vessel itself if they comply with the requirements of Section 122.60(a) (permit -by-rule for ocean disposal barges and vesse ls). (2) Specific exclusions and exemptions . The following persons are among those who are not required to obtain a State hazardous waste permit: (i) Generators who accumulate hazardous waste on-site for less than the time periods and under the conditions provided in Section 262.34 in compliance with all of the conditions for exemption provided in Sections 262.14, 262.15, 262.16, and 262.17 of these regulations . (ii) Farmers who dispose of hazardous waste pesticides from their own use as provided in Section 262.70 of these regulations; (iii) Persons who own or operate facilities solely for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste excluded from regulations under this part by Section Section 261.4 or 261.5 Sections 261.4 or 262.14 (very small quantity generator exem ption).

(iii) In the case of emergenc y responses involving military munitions, the responding military emergency response specialist's organizational unit must retain records for three years identifying the dates of the response, the responsible persons responding, the type and descri ption of material addressed, and its disposition. (4) Permits for less than an entire facility. DNREC may issue or deny a permit for one or more units at a facility without simultaneously issuing or denying a permit to all of the units at the facility. The interim status of any unit for which a permit has not been issued or denied is not affected by the issuance or denial of a permit to any other unit at the facility. (5) Closure by removal. Owners/operators of surface impoundments, land treatment units, and waste piles closing by removal or decontamination under Part 265 standards must obtain a post- closure permit unless they can demonstrate to the Secretary that the closure met the standards for closure by removal or decontamination in Section Section Sections 264.228, 264.280(e), or 264.258, respectively. The demonstration may be made in the following ways: (i) If the owner/operator has submitted a Part B application for a post-closure permit, the owner/operator may request a determination, based on information contained in the application, that Part 264 closure by removal standards were met. If the Secretary believes that Part 264 standards were met, he/she will notify the public of this proposed decision, allow for public comment, and reach a final determination according to the Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin.

(ii) If the owner/operator has not submitted a Part B application for a post-closure permit, the owner/operator may petition the Secretary for a determination that a post-closure permit is not required becau se the closure met the applicable Part 264 closure standards. (A) The petition must include data demonstrating that closure by removal or decontamination standards were met, or it must demonstrate that the unit closed under State requirements that met or exceeded the applicable 264 closure- by- removal standard. (B) The Secretary shall approve or deny the petition according to the procedures outlined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section. (6) Procedures for closure equivalency determination. (i) If a facility owner/operator seeks an equivalency demonstration under Section 122.1(c)(5), the Secretary will provide the public, through a newspaper notice, the opportunity to submit written comments on the information submitted by the owner/operator within 30 days from the date of the notice. The Secretary will also, in response to a request or at his/her own discretion, hold a public hearing whenever such a hearing might clarify one or more issues concerning the equivalence of the Part 265 closure to a Part 264 closure. The Secretary will give public notice of the hearing at least 30 days before it occurs. (Public notice of the hearing may be given at the same time as notice of the opportunity for the public to submit written comments, and the two notices may be combined.) (ii) The Secreta ry will determine whether the Part 265 closure met 264 closure by removal or decontamination requirements within 90 days of its receipt. If the Secretary finds that the closure did not meet the applicable Part 264 standards, he/she will provide the owner/ operator with a written statement of the reasons why the closure failed to meet Part 264 standards. The owner/operator may submit additional information in support of an equivalency demonstration within 30 days after receiving such written statement. The Secretary will review any additional information submitted and make a final determination within 60 days. (iii) If the Secretary determines that the facility did not close in accordance with Part 264 closure by removal standards, the facility is subject to post-closure permitting requirements. (7) Enforceable documents for post-closure care. At the discretion of the Secretary, an owner or operator may obtain, in lieu of a post-closure permit, an enforceable document imposing the requirements of Section 265.121. \"Enfor ceable document\" means an order, a plan, or other document issued by EPA or by an authorized State under an authority that meets the requirements of 40 CFR, 271.16(e) including, but not limited to, a corrective action order issued by EPA under Section 3008 (h) or DNREC under 7 Del.C., Chapter 63, a CERCLA remedial action, or a closure or post-closure plan.

Pads must provide the same degree of containment afforded by the non-RCRA tanks, containers and buildings eligible for exclusion. (A) The decision -maker must also consider if storage on pads poses the potential for significant releases via groundwater, surface water, and air exposure pathways. Factors to be considered for assessing the groundwater, surface water, air exposure pathways are: The volume and physical and chemical properties of the secondary material, including its potential for migration off the pad; the potential for human or environmental exposure to hazardous constit uents migrating from the pad via each exposure pathway, and the possibility and extent of harm to human and environmental receptors via each exposure pathway. (B) Pads must meet the following minimum standards: Be designed of non- earthen material that is compatible with the chemical nature of the mineral processing spent material, capable of withstanding physical stresses associated with placement and removal, have run on/runoff controls, be operated in a manner which controls fugitive dust, and have integri ty assurance through inspections and maintenance programs. (C) Before making a determination under this paragraph, the Secretary must provide notice and the opportunity for comment to all persons potentially interested in the determination. This can be accompl ished by placing notice of this action in major local newspapers, or broadcasting notice over local radio stations. (v) The owner or operator provides notice to the Secretary providing the following information: The types of materials to be recycled; the type and location of the storage units and recycling processes; and the annual quantities expected to be placed in land- based units. This notification must be updated when there is a change in the type of materials recycled or the location of the recycling process. (vi) For purposes of paragraph (b)(7) of this section, mineral processing spent materials must be the result of mineral processing and may not include any listed hazardous wastes.

A person who generates a solid waste, as defined in \u00a7261.2, must determine if make an accurate determination as to whether that waste is a hazardous waste using the following method: in order to ensure wastes are properly managed according to these regulations. A hazardous waste determination is made by using the following steps: (a) He should first determine if the waste is excluded from regulation under \u00a7261.4. (b) He must then determine if the waste is listed as a hazardous waste in Subpart D of Part 261. Note : Even if the waste is listed, the generator still has an opportunity under Part 260, Subpart C to demonstrate to the Secretary that the waste from his particular facility or operation is not a hazardous waste. (c) For the purpose of compliance with Part 268, or if the waste is not listed in Subpart D of Part 261, the generator must then determine whether the waste is identified in Subpart C of Part 261 by either: (1) Testing the waste according to the methods set forth in Subpart C of Part 261, or according to an equivalent method approved by the Secretary under Part 260, Subpart C, or; (2) Applying knowledge of the hazard characteristic of the waste in light of the materials or the processes used. (d) If the waste is determined to be hazardous, the generator must refer to Parts 261, 264, 265, 266, 268 and 273 of these regulations for possib le exclusions or restrictions pertaining to management of the specific waste. (a) The hazardous waste determination for each solid waste must be made at the point of waste generation, before any dilution, mixing, or other alteration of the waste occurs, and at any time in the course of its management that it has, or may have, changed its properties as a result of exposure to the environment or other factors that may change the properties of the waste such that the hazardous waste classification of the waste may change. (b) A person must determine whether the solid waste is excluded from regulation under \u00a7261.4 of these regulations. (c) If the waste is not excluded under \u00a7261.4 of these regulations, the person must then use knowledge of the waste to determine whether the waste meets any of the listing descriptions under Part 261, Subpart D of these regulations. Acceptable knowledge that may be used in making an accurate determination as to whether the waste is listed may include waste origin, composition, the process producing the waste, feedstock, and other reliable and relevant information. If the waste is listed, the person may file a delisting petition under \u00a7\u00a7260.20 and 260.22 of these regulations to demonstrate to the Secretary that the waste from this particular site or operation is not a hazardous waste. (d) The person then must also determine whether the waste exhibits one or more hazardous characteristics as identified in Part 261, Subpart C of these regulations by following the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, or a combination of both. Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin. Code 1302, Regulations Governing Hazardous Waste 2020 DRGHW Final Amendmen ts Page 46 of 214 December 2020 (1) The person must apply knowledge of the hazard characteristic of the waste in light of the materials or the processes used to generate the waste. Acceptable knowledge may include process knowledge (e.g., information about chemical feedstocks and other inputs to the production process); knowledge of products, by-products, and intermediates produced by the manufacturing process; chemical or physical characterization of wastes; information on the chemical and physical properties of the chemicals used or produced by the process or otherwise contained in the waste; testing that illustrates the properties of the waste; or other reliable and relevant information about the properties of the waste or its constituents. A test other than a test method set forth in Part 261, Subpart C of these regulations, may be used as part of a person's knowledge to determine whether a solid waste exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste. However, such tests do not, by themselves, provide definitive results. Persons testing their waste must obtain a representative sample of the waste for the testing, as defined at \u00a7260.10 of these regulations. (2) When available knowledge is inadequate to make an accurate determination, the person must test the waste according to the applicable methods set forth in Part 261, Subpart C of these regulations and in accordance with the following: (i) Persons testing their waste must obtain a representative sample of the waste for the testing, as defined at \u00a7260.10 of these regulations. (ii) Where a test method is specified in Part 261, Subpart C of these regulations, the results of the regulatory test, when properly performed, are definitive for determining the regulatory status of the waste. (e) If the waste is determined to be hazardous, the generator must refer to Parts 261, 264, 265, 266, 268, and 273 of these regulations for other possible exclusions or restrictions pertaining to management of the specific waste. (f)Recordkeeping for small and large quantity generators. A small or large quantity generator must maintain records supporting its hazardous waste determinations, including records that identify whether a solid waste is a hazardous waste, as defined by \u00a7261.3 of these regulations. Records must be maintained for at least three years from the date that the waste was last sent to on-site or off-site treatment, storage, or disposal. These records must comprise the generator's knowledge of the waste and support the generator's determination, as described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The records must include, but are not limited to, the following types of information: The results of any tests, sampling, waste analyses, or other determinations made in accordance with this section; records documenting the tests, sampling, and analytical methods used to demonstrate the validity and relevance of such tests; records consulted in order to determine the process by which the waste was generated, the composition of the waste, and the properties of the waste; and records which explain the knowledge basis for the generator's determination, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The periods of record retention referred to in this section are extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Secretary. (g) Identifying hazardous waste numbers for small and large quantity generators. If the waste is determined to be hazardous, small quantity generators and large quantity generators must identi fy all applicable EPA hazardous waste numbers (EPA hazardous waste codes) in Subparts C and D of Part 261 of these regulations. Prior to shipping the waste off site, the generator also must mark its containers with all applicable EPA hazardous waste number s (EPA hazardous waste codes) according to \u00a7262.32 of these regulations. ***** Section 262.12 EPA Identification Numbers. [Reserved] (a) A generator must not treat, store, dispose of, transport, or offer for transportation, hazardous waste without having received an EPA identification number from the Secretary. (b) A generator who has not received an EPA identification number may obtain one by applying to the Secretary using \"RCRA Subtitle C Site Identification Form\", EPA Form 8700- 12. Upon receiving the request, the Secretary will assign an EPA identification number to the generator. (c) A generator must not offer his hazardous waste to transporters that have not received an EPA identification number and a Delaware hazardous waste transporter permit or to treatment, storage, or Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin. Code 1302, Regulations Governing Hazardous Waste 2020 DRGHW Final Amendmen ts Page 47 of 214 December 2020 disposal facilities that have not received an EPA identification number. (d) A generator must submit a subsequent \"RCRA Subtitle C Site Identification Form\", EPA Form 8700- 12 whenever there is a change in name, mailing address, contact person, contact address, telephone number, ownership, type of regulated waste activity (for example, generator status), or changes in the description of regulated wastes managed or permanently ceases the regulated waste activity. This subsequent notification must be submitted to the DNREC Secretary no less than 10 days prior to implementation of the change(s). Section 262.13 Generator category determination. A generator must determine its generator category. A generator's category is based on the amount of hazardous waste generated each month and may change from month to month. This section sets forth procedures to determine whether a generator is a very small quantity generator, a small quantity generator, or a large quantity generator for a particular month, as defined in \u00a7260.10 of these regulations. (a) Generators of either acute hazardous waste or non-acute hazardous waste. A generator who either generates acute hazardous waste or non-acute hazardous waste in a calendar month shall determine its generator category for that month by doing the following: (1) Counting the total amount of hazardous waste generated in the calendar month; (2) Subtracting from the total any amounts of waste exempt from counting as described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section; and (3) Determini ng the resulting generator category for the hazardous waste generated using Table 1 of this section. (b) Generators of both acute and non-acute hazardous wastes. A generator who generates both acute hazardous waste and non-acute hazardous waste in the same calendar month shall determine its generator category for that month by doing the following: (1) Counting separately the total amount of acute hazardous waste and the total amount of non- acute hazardous waste generated in the calendar month; (2) Subtracting from each total any amounts of waste exempt from counting as described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section; (3) Determining separately the resulting generator categories for the quantities of acute and non- acute hazardous waste generated using Table 1 of this section; and (4) Comparing the resulting generator categories from paragraph (b)(3) of this section and applying the more stringent generator category to the accumulation and management of both non-acute hazardous waste and acute hazardous waste generated for that month. Table 1 to \u00a7262.13\u2014Generator Categories Based on Quantity of Waste Generated in a Calendar Month Quantity of acute hazardous waste generated in a calendar month Quantity of non-acute hazardous waste generated in a calendar month Quantity of residues from a cleanup of acute hazardous waste generated in a calendar month Generator category [ 1 kilogram > 1 kilogram] Any amount Any amount Large quantity generator.

Exporter means the person under the jurisdiction of the country of export who has, or will have at the time the planned transboundary movement commences, possession or other forms of legal control of the wastes and who proposes transboundary movement of the hazardous wastes for the ultimate purpose of Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin. Code 1302, Regulations Governing Hazardous Waste 2020 DRGHW Final Amendmen ts Page 82 of 214 December 2020 submitting them to recovery operations. When the United States (U.S.) is the country of export, exporter is interpreted to mean a person domiciled in the United States. Importer means the person to whom possession or other form of legal control of the waste is assigned at the time the waste is received in the country of import. OECD area means all land or marine areas under the national jurisdiction of any OECD Member country listed in \u00a7262.58.

Section 262.82 General conditions. (a) Scope. The level of control for exports and imports of waste is indicated by assignment of the waste to either a list of wastes subject to the Green control procedures or a list of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures and by the national procedures of the United States, as defined in \u00a7262.80(a). The OECD Green and Amber lists are incorporated by reference in \u00a7262.89(d). (1) Listed wastes subject to the Green control procedures. (i) Green wastes that are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in \u00a7262.80(a) are subject to existing controls normally applied to commercial transactions. (ii) Green wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in \u00a7262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures set forth in this subpart. (2) Listed wastes subject to the Amber control procedures. (i) Amber wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in \u00a7262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures set forth in this subpart. (ii) Amber wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in \u00a7262.80(a), are subjec t to the Amber control procedures in the United States, even if they are imported to or exported from a designated OECD Member country listed in \u00a7262.58(a)(1) that does not consider the waste to be hazardous. In such an event, the responsibilities of the Amber control procedures shift as provided: (A) For U.S. exports, the United States shall issue an acknowledgement of receipt and assume other responsibilities of the competent authority of the country of import. (B) For U.S. imports, the U.S. recovery facility/imp orter and the United States shall assume the obligations associated with the Amber control procedures that normally apply to the exporter and country of export, respectively. (iii) Amber wastes that are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in \u00a7262.80(a), but are considered hazardous by an OECD Member country are subject to the Amber control procedures in the OECD Member country that considers the waste hazardous. All responsibilities of the Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin. Code 1302, Regulations Governing Hazardous Waste 2020 DRGHW Final Amendmen ts Page 83 of 214 December 2020 U.S. importer/exporter shift to the import er/exporter of the OECD Member country that considers the waste hazardous unless the parties make other arrangements through contracts. Note to Paragraph (a)(2): Some wastes subject to the Amber control procedures are not listed or otherwise identified as hazardous under RCRA, and therefore are not subject to the Amber control procedures of this subpart. Regardless of the status of the waste under RCRA, however, other Federal environmental statutes (e.g., the Toxic Substances Control Act) restrict certain waste imports or exports. Such restrictions continue to apply with regard to this subpart. (3) Procedures for mixtures of wastes. (i) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more other Green wastes such that the resulting mixture is not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in \u00a7262.80(a) shall be subject to the Green control procedures, provided the composition of this mixture does not impair its environmentally sound recovery. Note to Paragraph (a)(3)(i): The regulated community should note that some OECD Member countries may require, by domestic law, that mixtures of different Green wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures. (ii) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more Amber wastes, in any amount, de minimis or otherwise, or a mixtu re of two or more Amber wastes, such that the resulting waste mixture is considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in \u00a7262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures, provided the composition of this mixture does not impair its environmentally sound recovery. Note to Paragraph (a)(3)(ii): The regulated community should note that some OECD Member countries may require, by domestic law, that a mixture of a Green waste and more than a de minimis amount of an Amber waste or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures. (4) Wastes not yet assigned to an OECD waste list are eligible for transboundary movements, as follows: (i) If such wastes are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in \u00a7262.80(a), such wastes are subject to the Amber control procedures. (ii) If such wastes are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in \u00a7262.80(a), such wastes are subject to the Green control procedures. (b) General conditions applicable to transboundary movements of hazardous waste: (1) The waste must be destined for recovery operations at a facility that, under applicable domestic law, is operating or is authorized to operate in the importing country; (2) The transboundary movement must be in compliance with applicable international transport agreements; and Note to Paragraph (b)(2): These international agreements include, but are not limited to, the Chicago Convention (1944), ADR (1957), ADNR (1970), MARPOL Convention (1973/1978), SOLAS Convention (1974), IMDG Code (1985), COTIF (1985), and RID (1985). (3) Any transit of waste through a non-OECD Member country must be conducted in compliance with all applicable international and national laws and regulations. (c)Provisions relating to re-export for recovery to a third country: (1) Re-export of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures from the United States, as the country of import, to a third country listed in \u00a7262.58(a)(1) may occur only after an exporter in the United States provides notification to and obtains consent from the competent authorities in the third country, the original country of export, and any transit countries. The notification must comply with the notice and consent procedures in \u00a7262.83 for all countries concerned and the original country of export. The competent authorities of the original country of export, as well as the competent authorities of all other countries concerned have thirty (30) days to object to the proposed movement. (i) The thirty (30) day period begins once the competent authorities of both the initial country of export and new country of import issue Acknowledgements of Receipt of the notification. (ii) The transboundary movement may commence if no objection has been lodged after the thirty (30) day period has passed or immediately after written consent is received from all relevant OECD importing and transit countries. (2) In the case of re-export of Amber wastes to a country other than those listed in \u00a7 262.58(a)(1), notification to and consent of the competent authorities of the original OECD Member country of export and any OECD Member countries of transit is required as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in addition to compliance with all international agreements and arrangements to which the first importing OECD Member country is a party and all applicable regulatory requirements for exports from the first Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin.

(a) Transboundary movements of hazardous wastes subject to the Amber control procedures are prohibited unless they occur under the terms of a valid written contract, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity). Such contracts or equivalent arrangements must be executed by the exporter and the owner or operator of the recovery facility, and must specify responsibilities for each. Contracts or equivalent arrangements are valid for the purposes of this section only if persons assuming obligations under the contracts or equivalent arrangements have appropriate legal status to conduct the operations specified in the contract or equivalent arrangements. (b) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must specify the name and EPA ID number, where available, of paragraph (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section: (1) The generator of each type of waste; (2) Each person who will have physical custody of the wastes; (3) Each person who will have legal control of the wastes; and (4) The recovery facility. (c) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must specify which party to the contract will assume responsibility for alternate management of the wastes if their disposition cannot be carried out as described in the notification of intent to export. In such cases, contracts must specify that: (1) The person having actual possession or physical control over the wastes will immediately inform the exporter and the competent authorities of the countries of export and import and, if the wastes are located in a country of transit, the competent authorities of that country; and (2) The person specified in the contract will assume responsibility for the adequate management of the wastes in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including, if necessary, arranging the return of wastes and, as the case may be, shall provide the notification for re-export. (d) Contracts must specify that the importer will provide the notification required in \u00a7262.82(c) prior to the re-export of controlled wastes to a third country. (e) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must include provisions for financial guarantees, if required by the competent authorities of any countri es concerned, in accordance with applicable national or international law requirements. Note to Paragraph (e): Financial guarantees so required are intended to provide for alternate recycling, disposal or other means of sound management of the wastes in cases where arrangements for the shipment and the recovery operations cannot be carried out as foreseen. The United States does not require such financial guarantees at this time; however, some OECD Member countries do. It is the responsibility of the export er to ascertain and comply with such requirements; in some cases, transporters or importers may refuse to enter into the necessary contracts absent specific references or certifications to financial guarantees. (f)Contracts or equivalent arrangements must contain provisions requiring each contracting party to comply with all applicable requirements of this subpart. (g) Upon request by EPA, U.S. exporters, importers, or recovery facilities must submit to EPA copies of contracts, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity). Information contained in the contracts or equivalent arrangements for which a claim of confidentiality is asserted in accordance with 40 CFR 2.203(b) will be Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin.

Note to Paragraph (g): Although the United States does not require routine submission of contracts at this time, the OECD Decision allows Member countries to impose such requirements. When other OECD Member countries require submission of partial or complete copies of the contract as a condition to granting consent to proposed movements, EPA will request the required information; absent submission of such information, some OECD Member countries may deny consent for the proposed movement. Section 262.86 Provisions relating to recognized traders. (a) A recognized trader who takes physical custody of a waste and conducts recovery operations (including storage prior to recov ery) is acting as the owner or operator of a recovery facility and must be so authorized in accordance with all applicable Federal and State laws. (b) A recognized trader acting as an exporter or importer for transboundary shipments of waste must comply with all the requirements of this subpart associated with being an exporter or importer.

Section 262.82 General conditions. (a) Scope. The level of control for exports and imports of waste is indicated by assignment of the waste to either a list of wastes subject to the Green control procedures or a list of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures and whether the waste is or is not hazardous waste. The OECD Green and Amber lists are incorporated by reference in \u00a7260.11. (1) Green list wastes. (i) Green wastes that are not hazardous wastes are subject to existing controls normally applied to commercial transactions, and are not subject to the requirements of this subpart. (ii) Green wastes that are hazardous wastes are subject to the requi rements of this subpart. (2) Amber list wastes. (i) Amber wastes that are hazardous wastes are subject to the requirements of this subpart, even if they are imported to or exported from a country that does not consider the waste to be hazardous or control the transboundary shipment as a hazardous waste import or export. (A) For exports, the exporter must comply with \u00a7262.83. (B) For imports, the recovery or disposal facility and the importer must comply with \u00a7262.84. (ii) Amber wastes that are not hazardous wastes, but are cons idered hazardous by the other country are subject to the Amber control procedures in the country that considers the waste hazardous, and are not subject to the requirements of this subpart. All responsibilities of the importer or exporter shift to the foreign importer or foreign exporter in the other country that considers the waste hazardous unless the parties make other arrangements through contracts. [Note to Paragraph (a)(2): Some Amber list wastes are not listed or otherwise identified as hazardous under RCRA, and therefore are not subject to the requirements of this subpart. Regardless of the status of the waste under RCRA, however, other Federal environmental statutes (e.g., the Toxic Substances Control Act) restrict certain waste imports or exports. Such restrictions continue to apply with regard to this subpart.] (3) Mixtures of wastes. (i) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more other Green wastes such that the resulting mixture is not hazardous waste is not subject to the requirements of this subpart. [Note to Paragraph (a)(3)(i): The regulated community should note that some countries may require, by domestic law, that mixtures of different Green wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures.] (ii) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more Amber wastes, in any amount, de minimis or otherwise, or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes, such that the resulting waste mixture is hazardous waste is subject to the requirements of this subpart. [Note to Paragraph (a)(3)(ii): The regulated community should note that some countries may require, by domestic law, that a mixture of a Green waste and more than a de minimis amount of an Amber waste or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures.] (4) Wastes not yet assigned to an OEC D waste list are eligible for transboundary movements, as follows: (i) If such wastes are hazardous wastes, such wastes are subject to the requirements of this subpart. (ii) If such wastes are not hazardous wastes, such wastes are not subject to Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin.

Section 262.255 Required aisle space. The large quantity generator must maintain aisle space to allow the unobstructed movement of personnel, fire protection equipment, spill control equipment, and decontamination equipment to any area of facility operation in an emergency, unless aisle space is not needed for any of these purposes. Section 262.256 Arrangements with local authorities. (a) The large quantity generator must attempt to make arrangements with the local police department, fire department, other emergency response teams, emergency response contractors, equipment suppliers, and local hospitals, taking into account the types and quantities of hazardous wastes handled at the facility. Arrangements may be made with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, if it is determined to be the appropriate organization with which to make arrangements. (1) A large quantity generator attempting to make arrangements with its local fire department must determine the potential need for the services of the local police department, other emergency response teams, emer gency response contractors, equipment suppliers and local hospitals. (2) As part of this coordination, the large quantity generator shall attempt to make arrangements, as necessary, to familiarize the above organizations with the layout of the facility, the properties of the hazardous waste handled at the facility and associated hazards, places where personnel would normally be working, entrances to roads inside the facility, and possible evacuation routes as well as the types of injuries or illnesses which could result from fires, explosions, or releases at the facility. (3) Where more than one police or fire department might respond to an emergency, the large quantity generator shall attempt to make arrangements designating primary emergency authority to a speci fic fire or police department, and arrangements with any others to provide support to the primary emergency authority. (b) The large quantity generator shall maintain records documenting the arrangements with the local fire department as well as any other organization necessary to respond to an emergency. This documentation must include documentation in the operating record that either confirms such arrangements actively exist or, in cases where no arrangements exist, confirms that attempts to make such arrangements were made. These records must be kept for a period of at least 3 years since last being applicable. (c) A facility possessing 24-hour response capabilities may seek a waiver from the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) over the fire code within the facility's state or locality as far as needing to make arrangements with the local fire department as well as any other organization necessary to respond to an emergency, provided that the waiver is documented in the operating record. Sections 262.257 throug h 262.259 [Reserved]. Section 262.260 Purpose and implementation of contingency plan. (a) A large quantity generator must have a contingency plan for the facility.

Section 262.261 Content of contingency plan. (a) The contingency plan must describe the actions facility personnel must take to comply with \u00a7\u00a7262.260 and 262.265 in response to fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water at the facility. (b) If the generator has already prepared a Spill Prevention, Control , and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan in accordance with 40 CFR Part 112, or some other emergency or contingency plan, it need only amend that plan to incorporate hazardous waste management provisions that are sufficient to comply with the standards of this part. The generator may develop one contingency plan that meets all regulatory standards. The Department recommends that the plan be based on the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (\"One Plan\"). (c) The plan must describe arrangements agreed to with the local police department, fire department, other emergency response teams, emergency response contractors, equipment suppliers, local hospitals or, if applicable, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, pursuant to \u00a7262.256. (d) The plan must list names and emergency telephone numbers of all persons qualified to act as emergency coordinator (see \u00a7262.264), and this list must be kept up to date. Where more than one person is listed, one must be named as primary emergency coordinator and others must be listed in the order in which they will assume responsibility as alternates. In situations where the generator facility has an emergency coordinator continuously on duty because it operates 24 hours per day, every day of the year, the plan may list the staffed position (e.g., operations manager, shift coordinator, shift operations supervisor) as well as an emergency telephone number that can be guaranteed to be answered at all times. (e) The plan must include a list of all emergency equipment at the facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill control equipment, communications and alarm systems (internal and external), and decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list must be kept up to date. In addition, the plan must include the location and a physical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its capabilities. (f)The plan must include an evacuation plan for generator personnel where there is a possibility that evacuation could be necessary. This plan must describe signal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation routes, and alternate evacuation routes (in cases where the primary routes could be blocked by releases of hazardous waste or fires). Section 262.262 Copies of contingency plan. A printed copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to the plan must be maintained at the large quantity generator's facility and\u2014 (a) The large quantity generator must submit a copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to all local emergency responders (i.e., police departments, fire departments, hospitals, and State and local emergency response teams that may be called upon to provide emergency services). This document may also be submitted to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, as appropriate. Documentation of written submission and receipt must be maintained at the facility for three (3) years from the requirement last being applicable. (b) A large quantity generator that first becomes subject to these provisions after [[insert effective date of these regula tions] January 21, 2021] or a large quantity generator that is otherwise amending its contingency plan must at that time submit a quick reference guide of the contingency plan to the local emergency responders identified in paragraph (a) of this section or, as appropriate, the Local Emergency Planning Committee. The quick reference guide must include the following elements: (1) The types/names of hazardous wastes in layman's terms and the associated hazard associated with each hazardous waste present at any one time (e.g., toxic paint wastes, spent ignitable solvent, corrosive acid); (2) The estimated maximum amount of each hazardous waste that may be present at any one time; (3) The identification of any hazardous wastes where exposure would require unique or Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin.

(b) Generators must update, if necessary, their quick reference guides, whenever the contingency plan is amended and submit these documents to the local emergency responders identified at paragraph (a) of this section or, as appropriate, the Local Emergency Planning Committee. Section 262.263 Amendment of contingency plan. The contingency plan must be reviewed, and immediately amended, if necessary, whenever: (a) Applicable regulations are revised; (b) The plan fails in an emergency; (c) The generator facility changes \u2014in its design, construction, operation, maintenance, or other circumstances\u2014in a way that materially increases the potential for fires, explosions, or releases of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents, or changes the response necessary in an emergency; (d) The list of emergency coordinators changes; or (e) The list of emergency equipment changes. Section 262.264 Emergency coordinator. At all times, there must be at least one employee either on the generator's premises or on call (i.e., available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures and implementing the necessary emergency procedures outlined in \u00a7262.265. Although responsibilities may vary depending on factors such as type and variety of hazardous waste(s) handled by the facility, as well as type and complexity of the facility, this emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the generator's contingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and characteristics of hazardous waste handled, the location of all records within the facility, and the facility's layout. In addition, this person must have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan. Section 262.265 Emergency procedures. (a) Whenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or his designee when the emergency coordinator is unavailable) must immediately: (1) Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and (2) Notify appropriate state or local agencies with designated response roles if their help is needed. (b) Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency coordinator must immediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any released materials. The emergency coordinator may do this by observation or review of the facility records or manifests and, if necessary, by chemical analysis. (c) Concurrently, the emergency coordinator must assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (e.g., the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-offs from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosi ons). (d) If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, the emergency coordinator must report the findings as follows: Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin. Code 1302, Regulations Governing Hazardous Waste 2020 DRGHW Final Amendmen ts Page 114 of 214 December 2020 (1) If the assessm ent indicates that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, the emergency coordinator must immediately notify appropriate local authorities. The emergency coordinator must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated; and (2) The emergency coordinator must immediately notify either the government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for that geographical area, or the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll free number (800) 424-8802) and the Department's Emergency Response Team at (800) 662-8802 or (302) 739-9401. The report must include: (i) Name and telephone number of reporter; (ii) Name and address of the generator; (iii) Time and type of incident (e.g., release, fire); (iv)Name and quantity of material (s) involved, to the extent known; (v) The extent of injuries, if any; and (vi) The possible hazards to human health, or the environment, outside the facility. (e) During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste at the generator's facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing released hazardous waste, and removing or isolating containers. (f)If the generator stops operations in response to a fire, explosion, or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment , wherever this is appropriate. (g) Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator must provide for treating, storing, or disposing of recovered waste, contaminated soil, or surface water, or any other material that results from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility. Unless the generator can demonstrate, in accordance with \u00a7261.3(c) or (d) of these regulations, that the recovered material is not a hazardous waste, then it is a newly generated hazardous waste that must be managed in accordance with all the applicable requirements and conditions for exemption in Parts 262, 263, and 265 of these regulations. (h) The emergency coordinator must ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility: (1) No hazardous waste that may be incompatible with the released material is treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedures are completed; and (2) All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed. (i) The generator must note in the operating record the time, date, and details of any incident that requires implementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, the generator must submit a written report on the incident to the Secretary. The report must include: (1) Name, address , and telephone number of the generator; (2) Date, time, and type of incident (e.g., fire, explosion); (3) Name and quantity of material(s) involved; (4) The extent of injuries, if any; (5) An assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, where this is applicable; and (6) Estimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the incident. ***** Appendix to Part 262 Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest and Instructions (EPA Forms 8700- 22 and 8700- 22A and Their Instructions) U.S. EPA Form 8700- 22.

(vi) Total organic emissions from all affected process vents at the facility shall be determined by summing the hourly total organic mass emission rates ( , as determined in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section) and by summing the annual total organic mass emission rates ( , as determined in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section) for all affected process vents at the facility. (2) The owner or operator shall record such process information as may be necessary to determine the conditions of the performance tests. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test. (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide, or cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows: (i) Sampling ports adequate for the test methods specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. (ii) Safe sampling platform(s). (iii) Safe access to sampling platform(s). (iv) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment. (4) For the purpose of making compliance determinations, the time-weighted average of the results of the three runs shall apply. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances beyond the owner or operator's control, compliance may, upon the Secretary's approval, be determined using the average of the results of the two other runs. (d) To show that a process vent associated with a hazardous waste distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation is not subject to the requirements of this subpart, the owner or operator must make an initial determination that the time-weighted, annual average total organic concentration of the waste managed by the waste management unit is less than 10 ppmw using one of the following two methods : (1) Direct measurement of the organic concentration of the waste using the following procedures: (i) The owner or operator must take a minimum of four grab samples of waste for each waste stream managed in the affected unit under process conditions expected to cause the maximum waste organic concentration. (ii) For waste generated onsite, the grab samples must be collected at a point before the waste is exposed to the atmosphere such as in an enclosed pipe or other closed system that is used to transfer the waste after generation to the first affected distillation fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation. For waste generated offsite, the grab samples must be collected at the inlet to the first waste management unit that receives the waste provided the waste has been transferred to the facility in a closed system such as a tank truck and the waste is not diluted or mixed with other waste. (iii) Each sample shall be analyzed and the total organic concentration of the sample shall be computed using Method 9060A (incorporated by reference under \u00a7260.11 of these regulations) of \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication SW-846, or analyzed for its individual organic constituents).

Code 1302, Regulations Governing Hazardous Waste 2020 DRGHW Final Amendmen ts Page 162 of 214 December 2020 (iv) The arithmetic mean of the results of the analyses of the four samples shall apply for each waste stream managed in the unit in determining the time-weighted, annual average total organic concentration of the waste. The time- weighted average is to be calculated using the annual quantity of each waste stream processed and the mean organic concentration of each waste stream managed in the unit. (2) Using knowledge of the waste to determine that its total organic concentration is less than 10 ppmw. Documentation of the waste determination is required. Examples of documentation that shall be used to support a determination under this provision include production process information documenting that no organic compounds are used, information that the waste is generated by a process that is identical to a process at the same or another facility that has previously been demonstrated by direct measurement to generate a waste stream having a total organic content less than 10 ppmw, or prior speciation analysis results on the same waste stream where it can also be documented that no process changes have occurred since that analysis that could affect the waste total organic concentration. (e) The determination that distillation fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operations manage hazardous wastes with time- weighted annual average total organic concentrations less than 10 ppmw shall be made as follows: (1) By the effective date that the facility becomes subject to the provisions of this subp art or by the date when the waste is first managed in a waste management unit, whichever is later; and (2) For continuously generated waste, annually; or (3) Whenever there is a change in the waste being managed or a change in the process that generates or treats the waste. (f) When an owner or operator and the Secretary do not agree on whether a distillation, fractionation, thin- film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation manages a hazardous waste with organic concentrations of at least 10 ppmw based on knowledge of the waste, the dispute may be resolved by using direct measurement as specified at paragraph (d)(1) of this section. ***** Section 265.1050 Applicability.

In this method, individual congeners or homologues1 are measured and then summed to yield a total PCDD/PCDF value. No toxicity factors are specified in the method to compute risks from such emissions. 1The term \"congener\" refers to any one particular member of the same chemical family; e.g., there are 75 congeners of chlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins. The term \"homologue\" refers to a group of structurally related Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin.

For example, there are eight homologues of CDs, monochlorinated through octachlorinated. Dibenzo -p-dioxins and dibenzofurans that are chlorinated at the 2,3,7, and 8 positions are denoted as \"2378\" congeners, except 2,3,7,8- 1,2,3,7,8 -PeCDF and - PeCDF are both referred to as \"2378- PeCDFs.\" For the purpose of estimating risks posed by emissions from boilers and industrial furnaces, however, specific congeners and homologues must be measured using the specified method and then multiplied by the assigned toxicity equivalence factors (TEFs), using procedures described in \"Interim Procedures for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures to Mixtures of Chlorinated Dibenzo -p-Dioxins and Dibenzofurans (CDDs and CDFs) -89/016, March 1989. The resulting 2,3,7,8 -TCDD equivalents value is used in the subsequent risk calculations and modeling efforts as discussed in the BIF final rule. The procedure for calcu lating the 2,3,7,8- TCDD equivalent is as follows: 1. Using method 23, determine the concentrations of 2,7,3,8- congeners of various PCDDs and PCDFs in the sample. 2. Multiply the congener concentrations in the sample by the TEF listed in Table 4.0-1 to express the congener concentrations in terms of 2,3,7,8 -TCDD equivalent. Note that congeners not chlorinated at 2,3,7, and 8 positions have a zero toxicity factor in this table. 3. Add the products obtained in step 2, to obtain the total 2,3,7,8 -TCDD equivalent in the sample.

These handlers are subject to regulation under Part 273. (1) Batteries as described in \u00a7273.2 of these regulations; (2) Pesticides as described in \u00a7273.3 of these regulations; (3) Mercury -containing equipment as described in \u00a7273.4 of these regulations; and (4) Lamps as described in \u00a7273.5 of these regulations. regulations; and (5) Aerosol cans as described in \u00a7273.6 of these regulations. ***** Section 268.7 Testing, tracking, and recordkeeping requirements for generators, reverse distributors , treaters, and disposal facilities. (a) Requirements for generators and reverse distributors : (1) A generator of hazardous waste must determine if the waste has to be treated before it can be land disposed. This is done by determining if the hazardous waste meets the treatment standards in \u00a7268.40, 268.45, or \u00a7268.49. This determination can be made concurrently with the hazardous waste determinat ion required in \u00a7262.11 of these regulations, in either of two ways: testing the waste or using knowledge of the waste. If the generator tests the waste, testing would normally determine the total concentration of hazardous constituents, or the concentrati on of hazardous constituents in an extract of the waste obtained using test method 1311 in \"Test Methods of Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication SW-846, (incorporated by reference, see \u00a7260.11 of these regulations), depending on whether the treatment standard for the waste is expressed as a total concentration or concentration of hazardous constituent in the waste's extract. (Alternatively, the generator must send the waste to a RCRA -permitted hazardous waste treatment facility, where the waste treatment facility must comply with the requirements of \u00a7264.13 of these regulations and paragraph (b) of this section.) In addition, some hazardous wastes must be treated by particular treatment methods before they can be land dispose d and some soils are contaminated by such hazardous wastes. These treatment standards are also found in \u00a7268.40, and are described in detail in \u00a7268.42, Table 1. These wastes, and soils contaminated with such wastes, do not need to be tested (however, if they are in a waste mixture, other wastes with concentration level treatment standards would have to be tested). If a generator determines they are managing a waste or soil contaminated with a waste, that displays a hazardous characteristic of ignitabilit y, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity, they must comply with the special requirements of \u00a7268.9 of this part in addition to any applicable requirements in this section. (2) If the waste or contaminated soil does not meet the treatment standards, or if the generator chooses not to make the determination of whether his waste must be treated, with the initial shipment of waste to each treatment or storage facility, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each treatment or storage facility receiving the waste, and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the information in column \"268.7(a)(2)\" of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. (Alternatively, if the generator chooses not to make the determinat ion of whether the waste must be treated, the notification must include the EPA Hazardous Waste Numbers and Manifest Number of the first shipment and must state \"This hazardous waste may or may not be subject to the LDR treatment standards. The treatment facility must make the determination.\") No further notification is necessary until such time that the waste or facility change, in which case a new notification must be sent and a copy placed in the generator's file. (3) If the waste or contaminated soil meets the treatment standard at the original point of generation: (i) With the initial shipment of waste to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility receiving the waste, and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the information indicated in column \"268.7(a)(3)\" of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in \u00a7268.7(a)(4) and the following certification statement, signed by an authorized representat ive: Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin. Code 1302, Regulations Governing Hazardous Waste 2020 DRGHW Final Amendmen ts Page 192 of 214 December 2020 I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste through analysis and testing or through knowledge of the waste to support this certification that the waste complies with the treatment standards specified in Part 268 Subpart D. I believe that the information I submitted is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of a fine and imprisonment. (ii) For contaminated soil, with the initial shipment of wastes to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each facility receiving the waste and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the information in column \"268.7(a)(3)\" of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in \u00a7268.7(a)(4). (iii) If the waste changes, the generator must send a new notice and certification to the receiving facility, and place a copy in their files. Generators of hazardous debris excluded from the definition of hazardous waste under \u00a7261.3(f) of these regulations are not subject to these requirements. (4) For reporting, tracking, and recordkeeping when exceptions allow certain wastes or contaminated soil that do not meet the treatment standards to be land disposed: There are certain exemptions from the requirement that hazardous wastes or contaminated soil meet treatment standards before they can be land disposed. These include, but are not limited to case - by-case extensions under \u00a7268.5, disposal in a no-migration unit under \u00a7268.6, or a national capacity variance or case -by-case capacity variance under Subpart C of this part. If a generator's waste is so exempt, then with the initial shipment of waste, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each land disposal facility receiving the waste. The notice must include the information indicated in column \"268.7(a)(4)\" of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table below. If the waste changes, the generator must send a new notice to the receiving facility, and place a copy in their files. Generator Paperwork Requirements Table Required information \u00a7268.7 (a)(2) \u00a7268.7 (a)(3) \u00a7268.7 (a)(4) Numbers and Manifest Number of first shipment 2. Statement: this waste is not prohibited from land disposal 3. The waste is subject to the LDRs. The constituents of concern for F001- F005, and F039, and underlying hazardous constituents in characteristic wastes, unless the waste will be treated and monitored for all constituents. If all constituents will be treated and monitored, there is no need to put them all on the LDR notice 4. The notice must include the applicable wastewater/ nonwastewater category (see \u00a7\u00a7268.2(d) and (f)) and subdivisions made within a waste code based on waste -specific criteria (such as D003 reactive cyanide) 5. Waste analysis data (when available) 6. Date the waste is subject to the prohibition 7. For hazardous debris, when treating with the alternative treatment technologies provided by \u00a7268.45: the contaminants subject to treatment, as described in \u00a7268.45(b); and an indication that these contaminants are being treated to comply with \u00a7268.45 Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin.

For contaminated soil subject to LDRs as provided in \u00a7268.49(a), the constituents subject to treatment as described in \u00a7268.49(d), and the following statement: This contaminated soil [does/does not] contain listed hazardous waste and [does/does not] exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste and [is subject to/complies with] the soil treatment standards as provided by \u00a7268.49(c) or the universal treatment standards 9. A certification is needed (see applicable section for exact wording) (5) If a generator is managing and treating prohibited waste or contaminated soil in tanks, containers, or containment buildings regulated under \u00a7262.34 \u00a7\u00a7262.15, 262.16, and 262.17 to meet applicable LDR treatment standards found at \u00a7268.40, the generator must develop and follow a written waste analysis plan which describes the procedures they will carry out to comply with the treatment standards. (Generators treating hazardous debris under the alternative treatment standards of Table 1, \u00a7268.45 Table 1 to \u00a7268.45, however, are not subject to these waste analysis requirements.) The plan must be kept on site in the generator's records, and the following requirements must be met: (i) The waste analysis plan must be based on a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative sample of the prohibited waste(s) being treated, and contain all information necessary to treat the waste(s) in accordance with the requirements of this part, including the selected testing frequency. (ii) Such plan must be kept in the facility's on-site files and made available to inspectors. (iii) Wastes shipped off-site pursuant to this paragraph must comply with the notification requirements of \u00a7268.7(a)(3). (6) If a generator determines that the waste or contaminated soil is restricted based solely on his knowledge of the waste, all supporting data used to make this determination must be retained on- site in the generator's files. If a generator determines that the waste is restricted based on testing this waste or an extract developed using the test method 1311 in \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication SW-846, as referenced in \u00a7260.11 of these regulations, and all waste analysis data must be retained on-site in the generator's files. (7) If a generator determines that he is managing a prohibited waste that is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste or is exempted from regulation under \u00a7261.2 through \u00a7261.6 subsequent to the point of generation (including deactivated characteristic hazardous wastes managed in wastewater treatment systems subject to the Clean Water Act (CWA) as specified at \u00a7261.4(a)(2) or that are CWA -equivalent, or are managed in an underground injection well regulated by the SDWA), he must place a one-time notice describing such generation, subsequent exclusion from the definition of hazardous or solid waste or exemption from these regulations, and the disposition of the waste, in the facility' s on-site files. (8) Generators must retain on-site a copy of all notices, certifications, waste analysis data, and other documentation produced pursuant to this section for at least three years from the date that the waste that is the subject of such document ation was last sent to on-site or off-site treatment, storage, or disposal. The three year record retention period is automatically extended during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Secretary. The requirements of this paragraph apply to solid wastes even when the hazardous characteristic is removed prior to disposal, or when the waste is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste under \u00a7261.2 through \u00a7261.6, or exempted from these regulations, subsequent to the point of generation. (9) If a generator is managing a lab pack containing hazardous wastes and wishes to use the alternative treatment standard for lab packs found at \u00a7268.42(c): (i) With the initial shipment of waste to a treatment facility, the generator must submit a notice that provides the information in column \"\u00a7268.7(a)(9)\" in the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and the following certification. The certification, which must be signed by an authorized representative and must be placed in the generator's files, must say the following: Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin.

I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine or imprisonment. (ii) No further notification is necessary until such time that the wastes in the lab pack change, or the receiving facility changes, in which case a new notice and certification must be sent and a copy placed in the generator's file. (iii) If the lab pack contains characteristic hazardous wastes (D001 -D043), underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in \u00a7268.2(i)) need not be determined. (iv) The generator must also comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) of this section. (10) [Reserved]. (b) Treatment facilities must test their wastes according to the frequency specified in their waste analysis plans as required by \u00a7264.13 (for permitted TSDs) or \u00a7265.13 (for interim status facilities) . Such testing must be performed as provided in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. (1) For wastes or contaminated soil with treatment standards expressed in the waste extract (TCLP), the owner or operator of the treatment facility must test an extract of the treatment residues, using test method 1311 (the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, described in \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication SW-846 as incorporated by reference in \u00a7260.11 of these regulations) to assure that the treatment residues extract meet the applicable treatment standards.

A certification is needed (see applicable section for exact wording) (4) The treatment facility must submit a one-time certification signed by an authorized repres entative with the initial shipment of waste or treatment residue of a restricted waste to the land disposal facility. The certification must state: I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the treatment technology and operation of the treatment process used to support this certification. Based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining this information, I believe that the treatment process has been operated and maintained properly so as to comply with the treatment standards specified in \u00a7268.40 without impermissible dilution of the prohibited waste. I am aware there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. A certification is also necessary for contaminated soil and it must state: I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the treatment technology and operation of the treatment process used to support this certification and believe that it has been maintained and operated properly so as to comply with treatment standards specified in \u00a7268.49 without impermissible dilution of the prohibited wastes. I am aware there are significant penalties for submitting a false certificatio n, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. (i) A copy of the certification must be placed in the treatment facility's on-site files. If the waste or treatment residue changes, or the receiving facility changes, a new certification must be sent to the receiving facility, and a copy placed in the file. (ii) Debris excluded from the definition of hazardous waste under \u00a7261.3(f) of these regulations (i.e., debris treated by an extraction or destruction technology provided by Table 1, \u00a7268.45, and debris that the Secretary has determined does not contain hazardous waste), however, is subject to the notification and certification requirements of paragraph (d) of this section rather than the certification requirements of this paragraph. (iii) For wastes with organic constituents having treatment standards expressed as concentration levels, if compliance with the treatment standards is based in whole or in part on the analytical detection limit alternative specified in \u00a7268.40(d), the certification, signed by an authori zed representative, must state the following: I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the treatment technology and operation of the treatment process used to support this certification. Based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining this information, I believe that the nonwastewater organic constituents have been treated by combustion units as specified in \u00a7268.42, Table 1. I have been unable to detect the nonwastewater organic constituents, despite having used best good- faith efforts to analyze for such constituents. I am aware there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. (iv) For characteristic wastes that are subject to the treatment standards in \u00a7268.40 (other than those expressed as a method of treatment), or \u00a7268.49, and that contain underlying hazardous constituents as defined in \u00a7268.2(i); if these wastes are treated on- site to remove the hazardous characteristic; and are then sent off-site for treatment of underlying hazardous constituents, the certification must state the following: I certify under penalty of law that the waste has been treated in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7268.40 or \u00a7268.49 to remove the hazardous characteristic. This decharacterized waste contains underlying hazardous constituents that require further treatment to meet treatment standards. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.

I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. (5) If the waste or treatment residue will be further managed at a different treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the treatment, storage, or disposal facility sending the waste or treatment residue off-site must comply with the notice and certification requirements applicable to generators under this section. (6) Where the wastes are recyclable materials used in a manner constituting disposal subject to the provisions of \u00a7266.20(b) of these regulations regarding treatment standards and prohibiti on levels, the owner or operator of a treatment facility (i.e., the recycler) must, for the initial shipment of waste, prepare a one-time certification described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and a one- time notice which includes the information in paragraph (b)(3) of this section (except the manifest number). The certification and notification must be placed in the facility's on-site files. If the waste or the receiving facility changes, a new certification and notification must be prepared and placed in the on-site files. In addition, the recycling facility must also keep records of the name and location of each entity receiving the hazardous waste- derived product. (c) Except where the owner or operator is disposing of any waste that is a recyclable material used in a manner constituting disposal pursuant to \u00a7266.20(b), the owner or operator of any land disposal facility disposing any waste subject to restrictions under this part must: (1) Have copies of the notice and certifications specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. (2) Test the waste, or an extract of the waste or treatment residue developed using test method 1311 (the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, described in \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication SW-846 as incorporated by reference in \u00a7260.11 of these regulations), to assure that the wastes or treatment residues are in compliance with the applicable treatment standards set forth in Subpart D of this part. Such testing must be performed according to the frequency specified in the facility's waste analysis plan as required by \u00a7264.13 or \u00a7265.13 of these regulations.

(a) Any Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, any person seeking to add a hazardous waste or a category of hazardous waste to this part may petition for a regulatory amendment under this subpart and \u00a7\u00a7 260.20 and 260.23. (b) To be successful, the petitioner must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that regulation under the universal waste regulations of Part 273 is: appropriate for the waste or category of waste; will improve management practices for the waste or category of waste; and will improve implementation of the hazardous waste program. The petition must include the information required by 260.20(b). The petition should also address as many of the factors listed in 273.81 as are appropriate for the waste or waste category addressed in the petition. (c) The Secretary will evaluate petitions using the factors listed in \u00a7273.81. The Secretary will grant or deny a petition using the factors listed in \u00a7273.81. The decision will be based on the weight of evidence showing that regulation under Part 273 is appropriate for the waste or category of waste, will improve management practices for the waste or category of waste, and will improve implementation of the hazardous waste program. (d)Hazardous waste pharmaceuticals are regulated by Part 266 Subpart P and may not be added as a category of hazardous waste for management under this part. ***** Section 273.81 Factors for petitions to include other wastes under Part 273. (a) The waste or category of waste, as generated by a wide variety of generators, is listed in Subpart D of Part 261 of these regulations, or (if not listed) a proportion of the waste stream exhibits one or more characteristics of hazardous waste identified in Subpart C of Part 261 of these regulations. (When a characteristic waste is added to the universal waste regulations of Part 273 by using a generic name to identify the waste category (e.g., batteries), the definition of universal waste in \u00a7260.10 of these regulations and \u00a7273.9 will be amended to include only the hazardous waste portion of the waste category (e.g., hazardous waste batteries).) Thus, only the portion of the waste stream that does exhibit one or more characteristics (i.e., is hazardous waste) is subject to the universal waste regulations of this Part 273; (b) The waste or category of waste is not exclusive to a specific industry or group of industries, is commonly generated by a wide variety of types of establishments (including, for example, households, retail and commercial businesses, office complexes, conditionall y exempt very small quantity generators, small businesses, government organizations, as well as large industrial facilities); (c) The waste or category of waste is generated by a large number of generators (e.g., more than 1,000 nationally) and is frequently generated in relatively small quantities by each generator; (d) Systems to be used for collecting the waste or category of waste (including packaging, marking, and labeling practices) would ensure close stewardship of the waste; (e) The risk posed by the waste or category of waste during accumulation and transport is relatively low compared to other hazardous wastes, and specific management standards proposed or referenced by the petitioner (e.g., waste management requirements appropriate to be added to \u00a7\u00a7 273.13, 273.33, and 273.52; and/or applicable Department of Transportation requirements) would be protective of human Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin.

(g) Regulation of the waste or category of waste under Part 273 will improve implementation of and compliance with the hazardous waste regulatory program; and/or (h) Such other factors as may be appropriate. ***** Section 279.10 Appli cability. This section identifies those materials which are subject to regulation as used oil under this part. This section also identifies some materials that are not subject to regulation as used oil under this part, and indicates whether these material s may be subject to regulation as hazardous waste under Parts 260 through 266, 268, 122, and 124 of these regulations. (a) Used oil. DNREC presumes that used oil is to be recycled unless a used oil handler disposes of used oil, or sends used oil for disposal. For the purposes of this part, in order for used oils to be legitimately recycled via an energy recovery process, the used oils must have a minimum energy value of 5,000 BTU/pound; otherwise, used oils sent for thermal treatment cannot be legitimately recycled and are subject to the requirements of Subpart I. Except as provided in \u00a7279.11, the regulations of this part apply to used oil, and to materials identified in this section as being subject to regulation as used oil, whether or not the used oil or material exhibits any characteristics of hazardous waste identified in Subpart C of Part 261 of these regulations. (b) Mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste (1) Listed hazardous waste. (i) Mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that is listed in Subpart D of Part 261 of these regulations are subject to regulation as hazardous waste under Parts 260 through 266, 268, 122, and 124 of these regulations, rather than as used oil under this part. (ii) Rebuttable presumption for used oil. Used oil containing more than 1,000 ppm total halogens is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in Subpart D of Part 261 of these regulations. Persons may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste (for example, by showing that the used oil does not contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in Appendix VIII of Part 261 of these regulations). (A) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are processed, through a tolling arrangement as described \u00a7279.24(c), to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply to metal working oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other manner, or disposed. (B) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units where the CFCs are destined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils contaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other than refrigeration units. (2) Characteristic hazardous waste. Mixing of used oil and hazardous waste that solely exhibit one or more hazardous waste characteristics identified in Subpart C of Part 261 are prohibited. Such incidental mixtures are subject to regulation as hazardous waste under Parts 260 through 266, 268, 122 and 124 of these regulations. (3) Conditionally exempt Very small quantity generator hazardous waste. Mixing of used oil and conditionally exempt very small quantity generator hazardous waste regulated under [\u00a7261.5 \u00a7262.14] of these regulations is prohibited. Such incidental mixtures are subject to regulation as hazardous waste under Parts 260 through Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin.

(c) Materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil from which the used oil has been properly drained or removed to the extent possible such that no visible signs of free-flowing oil remain in or on the material: (i) Are not used oil and thus not subject to this part, and (ii) If applicable are subject to the hazardous waste regulations of Parts 124, 260 through 266, 268, and 122 of these regulations. (2) Materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil that are burned for energy recovery are subject to regulation as used oil under this part. (3) Used oil drained or removed from materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil is subject to regulation as used oil under this part. (d) Mixtures of used oil with products. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, mixtures of used oil and fuels or other fuel products are subject to regulation as used oil under this part. (2) Mixtures of used oil and diesel fuel mixed on-site by the generator of the used oil for use in the generator's own vehicles are not subject to this part once the used oil and diesel fuel have been mixed. Prior to mixing, the used oil is subject to the requirements of Subpart C of this part. (e) Materials derived from used oil. (1) Materials that are reclaimed from used oil that are used beneficially and are not burned for energy recovery or used in a manner constituting disposal (e.g., re-refined lubricants) are: (i) Not used oil and thus are not subject to this part, and (ii) Not solid wastes and are thus not subject to the hazardous waste regulations of Parts 260 through 266, 268, 122, and 124 of these regulations as provided in \u00a7261.3(c)(2)(i) of these regulations. (2) Materials produced from used oil that are burned for energy recovery (e.g., used oil fuels) are subject to regulation as used oil under this part. (3) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, materials derived from used oil that are disposed of or used in a manner constituting disposal are: (i) Not used oil and thus are not subject to this part, and (ii) Are solid wastes and thus are subject to the hazardous waste regulations of Parts 260 through 266, 268, 122, and 124 of these regulations if the materials are listed or identified as hazardous waste. (4) Used oil re-refining distillation bottoms that are used as feedstock to manufacture asphalt products are not subject to this part. (f) Wastewater. Wastewater, the discharge of which is subject to regulation under either \u00a7402 or \u00a7307(b) of the Clean Water Act (including wastewaters at facilities which have eliminated the discharge of wastewater), contaminated with de minimis quantities of used oil are not subject to the requirements of this part. For purposes of this paragraph, \"de minimis\" quantities of used oils are defined as small spills, leaks, or drippings from pumps, machinery, pipes, and other similar equipment during normal operations or small amounts of oil lost to the wastewater treatment system during washing or draining operations. This exception will not apply if the used oil is discarded as a result of abnormal manufacturing operations resulting in substantial leaks, spills, or other releases, or to used oil recovered from wastewaters. (g) Used oil introduced into crude oil pipelines or a petroleum refining facility. (1) Used oil mixed with crude oil or natural gas liquids (e.g., in a production separator or crude oil stock tank) for insertion into a crude oil pipeline is exempt from the requirements of this part. The used oil is subject to the requirements of this part prior to the mixing of used oil with crude oil or natural gas liquids. (2) Mixtures of used oil and crude oil or natural gas liquids containing less than 1% used oil that are being stored or transported to a crude oil pipeline or petroleum refining facility for insertion into the refining process at a point prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking are exempt from the requirements of this part. (3) Used oil that is inserted into the petroleum refining facility process before crude distillation or catalytic cracking without prior mixing with crude oil is exempt from the requirements of this part provided that the used oil constitutes less than 1% of the crude oil feed to any petroleum refining Delaware Department of Natural Resour ces and Environmental Control Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances Compliance and Permitting Section Statutory Authority: 7 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6010(a) and 6305 7 DE Admin.
