This legislation created the Administration on Agingat the federal level and required that each state establish a state unit on aging to administer programs under theAct. Accordingly, Governor Orville Faubus established the Office on Aging in 1966 under the auspices of theGovernor's office. Since 1965, the Older Americans Act has been amended several times, each time expanding the role of state units on aging. Arkansas legislation also has changed the state unit's name, organization location, and its authority andfunding responsibilities. The state unit was placed within the Department of Social Services in 1971. Act 228 of1977 gave the agency divisional status and the responsibility for adult protective services was added by the GeneralAssembly in 1979. Act 348 of 1985 created the Division of Aging and Adult Services (DAAS) within the reorganizedArkansas Department of Human Services. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGING NETWOR K The federal organization that makes the Older Americans Act a reality is the Administration on Aging (AoA). AoA is directly under the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

Prioritypopulations for DBHS mental health services are individuals found not guilty by reason of mental disease ordefect; individuals assessed as potentially violent, other forensic clients; adults with a serious mental illness;children and adolescents with a serious emotional disturbance; and, others with mental health problems. The Arkansas State Hospital includes 90 adult acute care beds, 80 forensic beds, 16 adolescent acute care beds and 16 adolescent sex offender beds. Admission to acute care beds is through referral by the state'sCMHCs. Admission to forensic beds, for either evaluation and/or treatment, is by circuit court order. TheArkansas Health Center provides skilled nursing home services for individuals with mental health problems thatcannot be effectively managed in other nursing homes. The Center also provides some other specializednursing home care.The Divison of Behavioral Health Services (DBHS), within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for ensuring the provision of public mental health and substance abuse treatment/preventionservices throughout the state of Arkansas.As a consequence of this new system, in many instances, if the values in a row or column are summed, this \"Summed Value\" will be larger than the value entered in the \"Unduplicated Total\" column or row in theaccompanying tables. This is because the \"Unduplicated Total\" has been removed the duplication. In manyinstances the \"Unduplicated Total\" is removing true duplication. For example, one client was served by twodifferent providers, so this person is \"counted twice\" in a \"Summed Total\", once by each provider, however, inthe \"Unduplicated Total\" the person is counted only once. In some instances, however, differences between the \"Summed Value\" and the \"Unduplicated Total\" shown in the table is the result of data entry errors. So, for example, if one provider entered data showing an individualwas male when one service event was reported but was female when another service event was reported, thisperson would get counted under both the \"male\" and \"female\" columns. However, this person would becounted only once in the \"Unduplicated Total\" column. Given that the underlying data set from which this report is generated is based on over 2.7 million service events, a small amount of data entry error is inevitable.However, a certain amount of data error in the current report is the result of this being a new data system andfuture year reports should have progressively less data error. Mental Health ServicesThe Division of Behavioral Health Services (DBHS) instituted a new data reporting system for mental health services for SFY 2006. The data in the accompanying fifteen tables were generated from this new system. Aprimary advantage of the new system is that it includes, for the first time, a system-wide unique client identifierfor each person served. The previous system had only provider-specific unique identifiers. Consequently, withthe previous system it was not possible to determine system-wide the true unduplicated number of individualsserved. If an individual was served by two different Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC), the individualwas counted once in the unduplicated count for each CMHC, but twice in the system-wide total count of thoseserved. Similarly, an individual served by both a CMHC and the Arkansas State Hospital (ASH) was counted once in the unduplicated count of those served by the CMHC and once in the unduplicated count of those served byASH, but was counted twice in the system-wide total. Because duplication is now removed in the system-widecount of those served, the SFY 2006 system-wide total served unduplicated count (65,545) is lower than thepreviously reported SFY 2005 system-wide total served duplicated count (71,946).

DBHS-22DIVISION OF CHILD CARE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION Source: Child Care SystemThe 85thGeneral Assembly appropriated an additional $20 million to Arkansas Better Chance for School Success State Pre-K program to serve additional children. The total funding for ABC and ABCSS is now over$71 million. State Maternal and Child Health Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems Grant - The Arkansas Department of Health applied for the above-mentioned grant, with DCC&ECE named as the sub-grantee and leadconvener. This is a two-year planning grant that will develop with a 10-year plan to fundamentally integratechild development, educational, and medical efforts to support at-risk young children and their families so thatchildren can enter school in optimum social-emotional health and ready to learn. The State Pre-K program, Arkansas Better Chance for School Success, received a score of 9/10 by the National Institute of Early Education Research Annual State of Preschool Yearbook. The yearbook evaluationaddressed three areas of programming: access, quality standards and resources. The Kidcare System was implemented on July 1, 2005. Its purpose is to determine eligibility for Federally subsidized child care services (Child Care Vouchers), maintain waiting lists, authorized services, and reducefraud/overpayments. The system is designed to accurately determine a client's eligibility for child care servicesbased on program specific business requirements for Low Income, Foster Care, Protective Services,Transitional Employment Services, and Extended Support Services. The number of licensed child care centers in Arkansas has grown 15.8% over the past five years. The licensed capacity for all centers and homes in Arkansas has been expanded from 117,507 in 2001 to 162,613in 2006. This represents a growth of 38% over the past five years. The number of Quality Approved facilitiesin Arkansas has increased from 425 in 2004 to 589 in 2006, an increase of 38% during this two-year period.Currently, approximately 30% of all licensed child care centers are Quality Approved. The Arkansas Better Chance program expanded to serve 18,458 preschool children in high quality early childhood settings in 2006. Efforts to support working families, educate parents and ensure high quality early care and education services for Arkansas children continue to direct the activities of the Division of Child Care and Early Childhood Education(DCC&ECE). Highlights and Accomplishments During the Past Year Include: The Arkansas Out of School Network (AOSN) with funding from the National Governor's Association Center for Best Practice co-sponsored a Governor's Summit on Extra Learning Opportunities on March 9, 2006 at theClinton Presidential Library. This kick-off with support from Governor Mike Huckabee focused on the issuesrelated to high quality programs for school age children during out of school times. The AOSN has been fundedby the Mott Foundation for three years to support strategic planning, network building and communicationefforts. The USDA program expenditures grew from $31.5 million to $33.9 million to meet the increasing demand to serve nutritious meals to children in Arkansas. The program expenditures increase was due to growth in theChild and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) . CACFP had 350 contracts in 2005 and 426 contracts in 2006.The Special Nutrition Programs are continuing to identify and target counties with low participation or noparticipation. Over 2.2 million nutritious meals were served to eligible children.

The Unit inspects most licensedcenters and all licensed and registered homes a minimum of three (3) times per year. Some licensed centers suchas those with quality accreditation and high levels of compliance are monitored two times per year. Technicalassistance and consultative services are provided to licensed and registered programs, applicants and parents andto programs who have applied for Quality Approval or are already Quality Approved sites. During 2001, the Child Care Licensing Unit began development of a new computer system in order to update the licensing process, reduce paperwork and duplication of effort and to allow timely access to accurate licensing data.The new system, CLEAN, went on-line December 1, 2002. CLEAN has greatly enhanced the licensing process andhas proven not only to reduce the amount of time spent processing licenses, but also allows quick and accurateaccess to licensing information and reports. All other units within the Division have read only access to the CLEANsystem. The Child Care Licensing Unit is currently converting to the collection of all field data by hand-held \"tablet\"computers to further streamline the data collection process. Licensing specialists in over 50% of the state arecurrently using the tablet computers and the conversion process should be complete before the end of calendaryear 2006. The Unit continues to strive for the reduction in duplication of efforts, to improve both the safety of children in child care and to increase the number quality accredited programs. Source: Child Care LicensingThe Unit investigates complaints of non-compliance on licensed and registered child care facilities. The Unit alsoassists the Crimes Against Children Division, of the Arkansas State Police and the Division of Children and FamilyServices, in the investigation of child maltreatment complaints in these facilities. The Licensing Unit is responsiblefor processing and tracking background checks on all child care owners/operators and employees through the FBI,the State Police and the Arkansas Child Maltreatment Central Registry. Licensing staff members insure thatappropriate corrective action is taken on any persons found to have a record of child maltreatment and that personswho have a conviction of a prohibited offense are removed from child care. The Child Care Licensing Unit was placed with the Division of Child Care and Early Childhood Education following passage of Act 1132 in 1997. The Residential Placement Unit, previously a part of the Licensing Unit, remainedwith the Division of Children and Famil y Services. In 1997 the Child Care Licensing Unit shifted to open-ended licenses and reduced time frames for processing new applications for licensure from sixty (60) to less than thirty (30) days. During 2005 licensing standards for child carecenters, child care family homes and registered child care family homes were reviewed and revised. The revisionprocess was completed in October 2005, and the newly printed requirements were distributed to providers, with afinal publication date of February 2006. DCCECE-191.

The CACD is composed of twosections: 1) the Child Abuse Hotline, and 2) civilian employees who assess child maltreatment reports. TheCACD maintains an around-the-clock statewide intake process (The Child Abuse Hotline) for accepting reports ofalleged child maltreatment. The CACD's civilian employees are responsible for assessing Priority l allegations ofsevere maltreatment, involving severe physical and sexual abuse. They also conduct investigations ofmaltreatment in DCFS foster homes and pre-adoptive homes. CACD completed (24%) investigations inSFY 2006. DCFS staff housed in DHHS county offices assesses allegations of child maltreatment in which the perpetrator is in the home and not the specific responsibility of CACD. DCFS staff in the county office has primaryresponsibility for assessing an allegation of child maltreatment and seeks to ascertain the existence, cause,nature and extent of child maltreatment, the existence of previous injuries and the names and conditions of otherchildren in the home. DCFS remains primarily responsible for ensuring the health and safety of the children, evenif the primary responsibility for the investigation belongs to the CACD. DCFS has the responsibility for theassessment of Priority II reports. The Child Maltreatment Assessment Protocol (PUB-357) is used for screening and prioritizing all allegations of child maltreatment. This protocol is used when a DCFS Family Service Worker (FSW) or the CACD conducts aChild Maltreatment Assessment. It identifies and defines the various types of child maltreatment a FSW/CACDworker may encounter during an assessment. The protocol also identifies when and from whom an allegation ofchild maltreatment may be taken. Finally, it identifies those conditions, which must be met before an allegation ofabuse or neglect can be founded (determined to be true).In addition, DCFS investigates Priority I reports of abandonment, failure to protect, medical neglect of disabled infants, failure to thrive, malnutrition and substantial possibility of severe maltreatment. ARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT THE DIVISION OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES INTRODUCTION SFY 2006 DCFS is committed to protecting children and preserving families. Every child deserves to grow up in a permanent family. The primary and preferred way of achieving this goal is to provide families experiencingturmoil with services to prevent the need to place children outside their home. When a child must be separatedfrom his/her family, DCFS will provide a safe environment and will make efforts to provide services to reunite thefamily or to find the child a permanent home. In State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2006, 25,178 reports of abuse and neglect were investigated. Of these reports of abuse and neglect, 6,277 (25%) were determined to be true, 18,901 (75%) were unsubstantiated. Of thereports accepted for investigation, 19,123 (76%) were assigned to DCFS. When an investigation is determined to be true, DCFS opens a protective service case and works with the child(ren) and family in the home or, if the abuse is severe, DCFS places the child in a safe and home-likesetting. In SFY 2006, DCFS served 21,779 children in 9,792 families in this capacity. The purpose of services isto provide the child with a continuous, safe and stable living environment, promote family autonomy, strengthenfamily life where possible and promote the reunification of the child with the parent, guardian or custodian, whenapplicable. DCFS-1The Children's Reporting System used the following methodology to identify a foster child: Foster Homes Children's Reporting and Information System (CHRIS)Open Removal at any time during the SFY 2006 periodOpen Case at any time during the SFY 2006 perio d Open Removal late rthan adoption legalized date (this captures a child, when he /she goes back into Foster Care after the adoption has been dissolved).All children deserve a permanent home. One option is to terminate parental rights to free a child for adoptive placement when it has been determined to be in the best interest of the child. In SFY 2006, there were 281children placed in ado ptive homes. When a child has been removed and needs a foster home placement, DCFS places the child in an approved foster home. The approval process ensures that a potential foster parent attends training and meets health,safety, and physical requirements and satisfies other standards outlined in the Standards forApproval ofFoster Family Homes . In SFY 2006, there were 272 new foster homes approved, resulting in a total of 941 foster homes in Arkansas.ARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT THE DIVISION OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES The Famil yResource Centers (FRC) are community-based and famil yfocused and offer services directed toward prevention, intervention, and alleviation of community identified problems. Each facility provides educational andsupport services to assist parents, and they are open to all families in their targeted community. The centers aredesigned to work with the Division of Children and Family Services county offices to address the needs of DCFSclients.Preventive and Support Services Central Registry Foster Care Services Adoption ServicesThe school based Human Services Worker program was not funded in SFY 2006. Source: Division of Children and Family ServicesINTRODUCTION SFY 2006 CHRIS was implemented in December 1997 as DCFS' worker-based information system and source of data for state, federal and management reports. Data described in this report was pulled from the CHRIS system.This unit serves as the repository of all child maltreatment reports. The Child Maltreatment Reporting Act requires that a statewide central registry be established within the Department of Health and Human Services(DHHS) for the collection of information relative to the child maltreatment reports. The registry containsidentifying data, dates and circumstances of any persons requesting or receiving information from the registry.There were 46,534 registry checks made in SFY 2006. When there is no abuse or neglec tpresent, but a famil yrequests services, DCFS opens a Supportive Services case. In SFY 2006, DCFS served 1,570 children in 785 families. There are a limited number of situations when children cannot safely remain at home and must be separated from their family. When a child must be separated from the family, DCFS will provide a healthy and safeenvironment and will make appropriate and timely efforts to provide services to reunite the family. In 2006, DCFSplaced 6,835 in substitute care settings: Kinship Care, Foster Care, Therapeutic Foster Care, Residential Care,Shelters , etc. DCFS-2Child Maltreatment Assessment ServicesSource: Division of Children and Family ServicesCHILD MALTREATMENT ASSESSMENT SERVICES The Division of Children and Family Services maintains, via an interagency agreement with the Arkansas State Police an around-the-clock statewide intake process for accepting reports of alleged child maltreatment.

Act 348 of 1985 authorized the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services, and under this change DDS became one of 13 divisions/offices comprising an integrated services system. This Act designatedcontrol and administration of the HDCs under the management and direction of the DDS Board with daily operationauthority extended to the DDS Director, in coordination with the Director of DHHS. To accomplish its mission, DDS, the DDS Board, and its providers are committed to the principle and practices of normalization; least restrictive alternatives; affirmation of individuals' constitutional rights; provision of qualityservices; the interdisciplinary service delivery model; and the positive management of challenging behaviors.Background, Services and Mission DDS also provides an extensive range of services to individuals in community settings. These services are provided through private, not-for-profit programs whose service areas include all 75 counties of the state. There are 92 DDSLicensed Providers and 43 Early Intervention Voucher Providers. Additionally, DDS offers wrap-around services,which include Medicaid Waiver, individual/family supports and adaptive equipment. In 1971, the Governor designated Mental Retardation/Developmental Disabilities Services to administer the provisions of the Developmental Disabilities Services (DDS) and the Facilities Construction Act, or Public Law 91-517, (as amended). This legislation expanded the responsibility of the agency to serve individuals with cerebralpalsy, epilepsy, and autism. In 1981, Act 513 was passed and changed the name and official title of the agency and Board to the Division and the Board of Developmental Disabilities Services. Under this Act, the Arkansas Children's Colonies became theHuman Development Centers (HDCs). There are six HDCs across the state; the first opened in 1959 at Conway,and the last opened in 1978 in Warren. The HDCs are located in Conway, Alexander, Arkadelphia, Jonesboro,Booneville, and Warren. These programs provide services to 1,086 individuals (as of 07/30/06) with developmentaldisabilities who are in need of 24-hour residential, medical, and habilitative services. In 1955, the Arkansas General Assembly created the Arkansas Children's Colony with the passage of Act 6. This act has been revised and extended by numerous statutes, the latest being Act 1165 of 1975. Act 265 of 1969created the Arkansas Department of Mental Retardation. It also expanded the authority of the Children's ColonyBoard to include certain responsibilities for the individuals who, because of other disabilities, show characteristics ofmental retardation. DDS-1Any person or organization may refer a child to Title V for diagnosis and recommendations for treatment. Steps are then taken to secure an application for assistance through the DHHS county office, designatedhospitals or DDS Children's Services community based staff. A case record is then opened and a plan of carefor treatment is made and coordinated by the Title V staff.Title V Children with Special Health Care Needs (formerly known as Children's Medical Services):This is the entry point for children ages birth to 21 and their families seeking services from DDS. Service specialists are located in county offices across the state. They conduct intake interviews, perform eligibility determinations,and make referrals for services based on individual needs. They also complete intake and referral for Home andCommunity Based Waiver. The Children's Services Section also provides developmental disability services to children birth to five years of age. By networking with local community providers, DDS ensures that services comply with Parts B and C ofthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Title V provides specialized medical care and rehabilitation for chronically ill and physically disabled children whose families are partially or wholly unable to provide for such services and who meet the program's criteria.Title V staff determine financial and medical eligibility. A chronically ill/disabled child is defined as a child under18 years of age (under age 21 if funding allows) who has a disabling physical impairment (either congenital oracquired) or who has other conditions known to produce such physical impairments. Services are provided ina community setting by nurses, social workers, service specialists and support staff. Title V provides medical and surgical treatment, therapies, appliances, medications and care coordination. All medical specialty services for children must be prior approved by Title V service teams.Early Intervention/First Connections and Early Childhood Services:Engaging in statewide planning that ensures optimal and innovative growth of the Arkansas service system to meet the needs of persons with developmental disabilities and to assist such persons to achieve independence,productivity, and integration into the community.

These programs are designed to serve Arkansans throughou tthe state. The following pages highligh tthe State Fiscal Year 2006 performance of these programs through financial and utilization data and narrative.The Office of Long Term Care (OLTC) also surveys Adult Day Care, Adult Day Health Care, Post Acute Head Injury Facility, Residential Care Facilities and Assisted Living Facilities. In addition tosurveying facilities, OLTC administers the Nursing Home Administrator Licensure program, CriminalBackground program, Certified Nursing Assistant registry and training program, processes MedicalNeeds Determinations for Nursing Home and Waivers and operates a Complaints Unit.Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides medical assistance for eligible individuals based on financial need and/or health status. Medicaid furnishes medical assistance to those whohave insufficient incomes and resources to meet the costs of necessary medical services. It alsoprovides rehabilitative and other services to help families and individuals become or remainindependent and able to care for themselves. The Department o fHealth & Human Services (DHHS) is the single state agenc yauthorized and responsible for regulating and administering the program. DHHS administers the Medicaid Programthrough the Division of Medical Services (DMS). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services(CMS) administers the Medicaid Program for the U.S. Department of Human Services. CMSauthorizes federal funding levels and approves each state's State Plan, ensuring compliance withfederal regulations. Individuals are certified as eligible for Medicaid services by DHHS Field Stafflocated in DHHS County Offices or by District Social Security Offices. A list of covered services can be found on page DMS-13 of this publication. Mandatory services are required by the federal government. Optional services are those, which the state has elected toprovide. Many of these optional services enable recipients to receive care in less costly home orcommunity-based settings. Optional services are approved in advance by CMS and are funded atthe same level as mandatory services. Each year, more than 21,000 Arkansans who have chronic, long-term medical needs require services in long-term care facilities. These individuals live in the approximately 229 nursing facilitiesand 41 intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded that are licensed to provide long-termcare services in Arkansas.ARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT DIVISION OF MEDICAL SERVICES INTRODUCTION SFY 2006 DMS-1DMS Administration Expenditures 00 - Regular Salaries $11,005,031 01 - Extra Help 44,39002 - Maintenance & Operations 2,665,27903 - Fringe Benefits 3,248,58606 - Overtime 008 - Supplemental Salaries 009 - Conference Fees and Travel 134,09010 - Professional Fees and Services 289,70711 - Capital Outlay 111,86244 - Purchase Data Processing 105,95948 - Respite Care 0 Sub-Total $17,604,904 DMS ProgramsPrivate Nursing Home $490,292,174 Prescription Drugs 362,985,783Pres - Medicare Part D Temporary Program 6,423,472Hospital/Medical 2,029,672,173ARKids 68,011,857Child and Family Institute 0Infant Infirmary 19,950,262Nursing and Cost EvaluationARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES EXPENDITURES SFY 2006 DMS-2Hospital, Inpatient/Outpatient: Expenditure Inpatient Hospital $472,417,341.47 Outpatient Hospital 118,704,764.13 Total $591,122,105.60 Medical, Other: Adults with Physical Disabilities Waiver $27,927,318.39 Ambulatory Surgical Center 2,910,898.97ARKids Immunizations 1,049,742.77 AR Seniors 5,482,234.92 Assisted Living Agency Day Clinic Treatment Services 94,426,233.73Durable Medical Equipment/Oxygen 34,625,482.12Early Periodic Physical) SERVICESARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT SFY 2006 DMS-3Mental Health: Expenditure Community Mental Health Centers (Rehabilitative Services for Persons With Mental Illness)$200,505,642.06 935,085.17 School-Based MH Case Management (Children - Under 21-E) $159,027.50 Ages 21 to 59 12,271.39 $273,358,312.79 Managed Care Fee 13,421,606.89 $286,779,919.68 Special Care: Community Health Centers (Federally Qualified Health Center) $6,985,514.83 Home Health Services 12,975,191.04Hospice 3,899,542.04 Nursing Home Non-profit Transportation Transportation (NET) 19,978,997.02Non-Public Transportation 9,389,070.20 $41,308,419.97 Total Hospital/Medical $2,096,278,693.00MEDICAID EXPENDITURES BY SERVICES SFY 2006ARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT DMS-4Prescription Drugs: Expenditure Prescription Drugs $378,793,928.09 Family Planning Drugs 3,133,462.51Assisted Living Drugs 166,120.12Contracts 2,247,870.85 Total Prescription Dru gs $384,341,381.57 Nursing Home: Nursing Facilities $487,339,787.88 Contracts 2,952,385.98 $490,292,173.86 Private Intermediate Care Facility (ICF) Infant Infirmaries $17,737,259.77 $17,737,259.77 Public Nursing Home Public Nursing Homes $148,643,852.54 $148,643,852.54 Total Lon g Term Care $656,673,286.17 Source: DMS Financial ActivitiesSFY 2006 TOTAL MEDICAID PROGRAM $3,137,293,360.74ARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT MEDICAID EXPENDITURES BY CATEGORY OF SERVICES DMS-5Special Care includes Home Health, Private Duty Nursing, Personal Care, and Hospice Services.

At the end of the State Fiscal Year 2006 (SFY 2006), there were more than 20,790 enrolled providers in the above programs.More than 9,000 of these providers were physicians and physician groups. The Medical Assistance Section alsoresponds to the concerns and questions of providers and recipients of Medicaid and ARKids services. In SFY 2006,68,727 telephone inquiries were handled in all Assistance Sections including the Early Periodic, Screening, Diagnosisand Treatment (EPSDT) program and other Medical Assistance Units with over 12,782 of those inquiries being handledby the Program Communications Unit. The ARKids Program for Arkansas children has become a model for similarprograms in other states. Other areas administered by the Medical Assistance Section are the Dental, Visual, Non-Emergency Transportation (NET), ARKids B and Ambulance programs. SFY 2006 SFY 2005 SFY 2004 Telephone Inquiries One aspect of Medicaid cost containment is the Third-Party Liability Unit of Administrative Support. This unit pursues resources (other than Medicaid) responsible for health care payment to Medicaid recipients. These sources includehealth and liability insurance, court settlements, and absent parents. Federal and state statutes require Medicaidagencies to pursue Third-Party Liability to reduce Medical Assistance payments. The savings for SFY 2006 were asfollows: Other Collections (Health & Casualty Insurance) $16,171,781.00 Cost Avoidance (Health Insurance ) $12,071,628.46 SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT A major responsibility centered in the Systems and Support section is the administration and monitoring of theArkansas Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). This automated claims processing, data, andmanagement reporting system was initially certified in 1975 by Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) nowcurrently known as Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The Arkansas MMIS was one of the firstsystems of its kind to receive federal certification. The MMIS and fiscal agent operation is provided under contract with Electronic Data Systems (EDS), which assumed the contract for Medicaid claims payment processing on October 1, 1985. EDS began its fourth contract with ArkansasMedicaid on January 1, 2005. The latest contract provided for continued enhancements, maintenance and operation ofthe MMIS and related fiscal agent (FA) services through SFY 2011. Included in these were the Electronic cost reportscapability for Long Term Care facilities, Paperless tracking system for TORT for TPL, Provide Spanish versions of allrecipient letters, pamphlets, notices, etc., Design and implement Immunization Registry-Expanding electronic accessand Implement Clinical Edit/Prospective Drug Use Review Program, Fiscal Integrity Edit Program, Arkansas RX,HIPPAA Security and National Provider Identifier (NPI) Standards mandated by Center for Medicare and MedicaidServices (CMS).

Under this program, eligible recipients may obtain prescription medication through any of the 813 enrolled pharmacies in thestate. During SFY 2006, a total of 441,310 Medicaid recipients used their prescription drug benefits. A total of 5.8million prescriptions were reimbursed by Arkansas Medicaid for cost of $382.1 million dollars thus making the averagecost per prescription approximately $66. An average cost for a brand name prescription was $109 dollars, althoughrepresenting 50% of the claims it accounted for 82% of our expenditures. The average cost for a generic prescriptionwas $24 dollars, representing 50% of our claims and accounted for 18% of our expenditures. The Prescription Drug Program restricts each recipient to a maximum of three prescriptions per month, with the capability of getting up to six prescriptions by prior authorization, except for recipients under 21 and certified Long-TermCare recipients who receive unlimited prescriptions per month. Beginning January 1, 2006 full benefit dual eligiblesbegan to receive drug coverage through the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Part D) of the Medicare ModernizationAct of 2003 rather than through Arkansas Medicaid. Persons eligible under the Assisted Living Waiver are allowed upto nine prescriptions per month. Medicaid reimbursement for prescription drugs is based on cost plus a dispensing fee. Drug costs are established and based upon a pharmacy's estimated acquisition cost (EAC), the federally established generic upper limit (GUL) or stateestablished upper limit (SUL). Arkansas Medicaid has a dispensing fee $5.51 as established by the Division of MedicalServices and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). The EAC and dispensing fee are based uponsurveys that determine an average cost for dispensing a prescription and the average ingredient cost. In March of 2002we established a differential fee of $2.00 applied to generic prescriptions for which there is not an upper limit.

The OLTC professional surveyors conduct annual Medicare and Medicaid and State Licensure surveys of Arkansas' 229 Nursing Facilities and inthe state's forty-one (41) Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (ICFs/MR) including six (6) HumanDevelopment Centers. Annual surveys are also conducted in forty one (41) Adult Day Care and Adult Day Health Carefacilities and one (1) Post Acute Head Injury Facility throughout the state. Semi-annual surveys are conducted in theninety-four (94) Residential Care Facilities, twenty-two (22) Assisted Living Facilities and thirteen (13) Alzheimer's SpecialCare Units. In addition, annual Civil Rights surveys are conducted in 112 hospitals. In addition to its role inspecting long-term care facilities, the OLTC provides training and educational opportunities to various health care providers to help ensure that facilities provide the highest level of care possible to long term careresidents. In SFY 06, the Office of Long Term Care devoted nearly 950 hours of staff time to provide training andeducation to facilities throughout the State of Arkansas. OLTC staff members participated in thirty-nine (39) educationalprograms throughout the state to an audience of 8,075 healthcare professionals. In addition, approximately 533 submittedagendas were reviewed to determine 2,160 allowable credits for continuing education hours for nursing home administrators The Nursing Home Administrator Licensure Unit processed renewals for 648 licensed administrators, processed andissued sixty-eight (68) applications for new licenses and issued forty-one (41) temporary licenses. In addition, OLTCadministered the state nursing home administrator examination to fifty-nine (59) individuals. The Criminal Record Check Program applies to all categories of licensed long-term care facilities consisting of over 450 affected facilities. During SFY 06, there were 37,220 \"state\" record checks processed through OLTC with 859disqualifications (2.3%) 14,529 \"federal\" record checks processed with 170 disqualifications (1.2%). At the end of SFY 06, the Registry for Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) contained 24,447 \"active\" and 48,403 \"inactive\" names listed. In addition to maintaining the Registry for CNAs, the OLTC also manages the certification renewal processfor CNAs, approves and monitors nursing assistant training programs, manages the statewide competency testingservices, and processes reciprocity transfers of CNAs coming into and leaving Arkansas. The Medical Need Determination Unit processed approximately 1,062 Medicaid nursing facility applications per month while maintaining approximately 12,745 active cases and processing over 3,700 changes of condition requests during theyear. Also processed were 3,211 applications/reviews for ICFs/MR. In addition, almost 12,400 applications/reviews forother medical programs within DHHS were made during SFY 06. The OLTC Complaint Unit staffs a registered nurse and licensed social worker that record the initial intake of complaints against long-term care facilities. Many times they are able to resolve the issues with immediate satisfaction to the partiesinvolved. When that is not possible, the OLTC performs an on-site complaint investigation. The OLTC received 1,038nursing home complaints during SFY 06 regarding the care or conditions in long term care facilities.

In 1977, the Office was established by Act 865 to assess and recognize theneeds of communities throughout Arkansas and train volunteer coordinators and volunteer organizations in meeting those needs. The division also continues to assist in special projects to meet community needs and to provide greater public awareness and recognition of volunteer efforts. In 1983, the Office of Volunteer Services transferred from the Office of the Governor to the Department of Human Services (DHS). AR Code 25-10-102 officially made the agency a Division of DHS . The mission of the Division of Volunteerism (DOV) is to promote and support national service and volunteering in Arkansas. AR Code \u00a725-10-128 (Act of 1259 of 1997) expanded the duties of the Division of Volunteerism (DOV) to include assistance to the DHS Division of County Operations with welfare reform initiatives. The Economic Impact of Arkansas Volunteers: Each year the DOV publishes the study of \"THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF ARKANSAS VOLUNTEERS\". The results of the most recent study are as follows: Seven hundred and sixty-seven (767) volunteer organizations reported a total of 22,778,540 hours for an estimated total dollar value of $459,265,807 . Had the State of Arkansas paid for the time involved to provide the services donated by volunteers, an additional $10,110,190,995 in personal income would have been required to generate that sum in general revenues.

Maximize the potential contributions made by consumers as citizens and taxpayers.ARKANSAS DHHS STATISTICAL REPORT DIVISION OF SERVICES FOR THE BLIND INTRODUCTION SFY 2006 Arkansas Act 393 of 1975 amended Arkansas Act 38 of 1971 to require that the functions, powers and duties of the Rehabilitation Services for the Blind be located within an Office for the Blind and Visually Impaired in the Division ofRehabilitation Services. Act 393 gave the Office for the Blind and Visually Impaired statutory authority and legalauthority to promulgate rules, and established an Advisory Committee appointed by the Governor. In 1983, a number of consumer, education, and service organizations identified a critical need for specialized services to visually impaired and blind Arkansans. In response to this concern, the Governor and Legislatureestablished the Division of Services for the Blind (DSB) under Act 481. Although Arkansas offered separateservices for blind and visually impaired persons, Act 481 provided that the agency should be governed by a policy-making board, the majority of whom must be blind persons. Within the past decade, DSB has been commended forinnovative programming, consumer responsiveness, and consistently high performance in the rehabilitation ofseverely disabled persons. DSB functions both as a direct service provider and as a consumer agent in locating and purchasing quality services (including medical and educational services; equipment or supplies related to self-sufficiency; jobplacement or employment services; etc.). All direct services are made available to consumers in their owncommunities. DSB serves consumers through three interdependent units: Field Services ,Vending Facility Program , and the DSB Directors Office . These three service units were designed by the DSB Board to offer two advantages to the State of Arkansas:Agency Histor y During the 1940's and early 1950's, rudimentary services for blind people were provided by \"home teachers\" who were employed by the Arkansas Department of Welfare. In 1955, services to blind people were transferred to theArkansas Rehabilitation Services, then in the Department of Education. Arkansas Rehabilitation Services for the Blind was created in 1965 by Arkansas Act 180. This Act established a Division of Rehabilitation Services for the Blind within the State Board for Vocational Education. All services for theblind were transferred to said Division from the Arkansas Rehabilitation Services. Act 38 of 1971 transferred the functions, powers and duties of the Rehabilitation Services for the Blind to the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (now the Department of Health and Human Services) and placedthem in the Division of Rehabilitation Services. DSB-11. 2. 3.Our mission is to work in partnership with these Arkansans by assisting them in obtaining the information they need to make informed choices and by providing them with access to services that increase their opportunities to live asthey choose. Within the constraints o fstate and federal laws and based on available funds, the Division o fServices for the Blind fulfils its mission through the following goals:INTRODUCTION SFY 2006 Philosophy and Goals Source: DSB WebsiteEmployment - To assist Arkansans who are blind or visuall yimpaired to secure or maintain employment and consistent with their skills, abilities, and interests.

Field Services offered vocational rehabilitation and independent living services to blind and severely visually impaired persons in their homes and communities throughout Arkansas. Business and Technology Services provided assessment of technological and job development needs, then prescribed equipment and training plans to meet those needs in a rapidly changing job market and business environment. The DSB Director's Office supported the programs offered above through supplemental administrative services as wellas operating the Radio Reading Services for the Blind Network. DSB FIELD SERVICES Vocational Rehabilitation- The objective of the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program is to ensure that qualified blind and visually impaired persons work in appropriate careers and become as personally and economically independent as possible. The program assesses consumer needs, plans appropriate services based upon informedconsumer choice, and develops and provides cost-effective services for individuals who are blind or severelyvisually impaired. Consumers usually range in age from 14 to 64. The vocational rehabilitation services provided areconsistent with the strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities and informed choice of thedisabled individual. To be eligible for DSB services, the individual must have a visual disability. The visual disability must be a substantial impediment to employment. It must be determined that the individual with the visual disability can benefitfrom vocational rehabilitation services in the achievement of a vocational outcome. Additionally, the individualrequires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, engage in, or retain gainful employment. After anindividual is determined eligible for vocational rehabilitation, services are provided based on the DSB Order ofSelection criteria. Priority is given to the individual with the most significant visual disability. In SFY 2006, DSBserved 1,386 vocational rehabilitation consumers, of which 100% were severely disabled. Of this number, 344 blindor severely visually impaired individuals successfully achieved employment outcomes. 22 VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION (VR) DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN RACE WhiteBlackHispanic980 350 Indian Asian Other 338 15 7 Under the Vocational Rehabilitation Program, DSB also sponsored a special summer transition program in conjunction with the Arkansas School for the Blind (ASB).

DSB BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY SERVICES Consumer Technology- Like their sighted counterparts, blind college students, insurance agents, lawyers, social workers, ministers, physicians, etc., have multiple needs for computers and other technology. Computer systems with prescriptive sensory adaptations are developed by the Consumer Technology Program to enable blind andvisually impaired individuals to access the information needed for success in their chosen professions. During SFY 2006, there were 579 visits made to the Consumer Technology Lab with technology specialists providing consultation and training to 364 individuals . Additionally, numerous public inquiries were made by agencies, businesses, and individuals interested in learning more about adaptive equipment for blind and visually impaired people. The Technology Lab has proven to be valuable in allowing blind individuals to have access tocom puters for the purpose of gainin g experience in usin g adaptive e quipment.The Older Blind Program provides in-home instructions in the activities of daily living to Arkansans, age 55 and older, who are blind, severely visually impaired or have a rapidly progressive visual impairment.

In 2005 and 2006, the primary goal of the ACJJand DYS was disproportionate minority contact, as well as, the removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockupsassuring that those who needed detention were held in appropriate facilities. To accomplish this, the ACJJrecommended and the Division of Youth Services approved Title II Funds to eight agencies/organizations. Of the nine subgrants, two sub grants offer Gender Specific Services (GS). Two subgrants offer Disproportionate Minority Contact Services (DMC) with the goal of reducing over representation of minority youth along the entirecontinuum of the juvenile justice system. Four subgrants provide alternatives to the de-institutionalization of statusoffenders. One subgrant is Mental Health aimed at addressing mental health issues of juvenile. Two GenderSpecific services for girls. These subgrants continued from last fiscal year are listed below.
