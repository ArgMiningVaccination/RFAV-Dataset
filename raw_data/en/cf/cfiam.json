Complementary and alternative health practices, especially natural products, meditation, massage, manipulative therapies, and yoga are widely used by the American public, including children Chronic pain, especially back pain, is the most common reason Media coverage and public interest is strong NIH Research influences the publicNCCAM: Our Research Expertise Studying Real World Health Practices CHALLENGES Need to partner with disease experts Need careful product characterization Need strong preliminary dataPreliminary data needed for major RCT's of CAM interventions: Strong biological hypothesis Well described intervention 'Proof of concept' preliminary clinical data Good chemistry of any natural products (ADME) and marker(s) to verify biological effect in vivo Maximally sensitive outcome measures and t rial designNCCAM: The CAM Research Paradigm How does it work? Basic ScienceDo we have the tools to study it in people? Translational ResearchWhat are the specific effects? Efficacy StudiesIs it better treatment? Effectiveness ResearchBut there are lots of excessive claims NCCAM Research: Areas of promise in mind and body CAM approaches Benefits of mindfulness mediation for stress reduction and quality of life -for examples for Alzheimer care givers Benefits of yoga and Tai chi for balance and avoiding falls in elderly people Insight into of central mechanisms of reassurance and expectancy Contribution of acupuncture and other mind and body practices to pain managementNCCAM: Achievements in natural product research Implementation, in partnership with other IC's, of 6 major high- quality RCTs of widely used natural products Rigorous processes to assess quality and consistency of herbal and other natural products used in NCCAM research (PIWG: Product Integrity Working Group)Autism Spectrum Disorders: CAM for Symptom Management Numerous provider and parent reports suggest that certain CAM practices show promise to contribute to symptom management Limited scientific evidence Children's safety paramount NCCAM: Expertise in studying untested therapies already in use by the public CAM research, as a scientific discipline, has advanced dramatically in the last ten years NCCAM has established a CAM research enterprise at the Nation's premier biomedical research institutions Partnerships with CAM practitioners are critical to our efforts NCCAM has special expertise in applying rigorous scientific inquiry to health and wellness promotion practices already in use Experience has taught us that the evidence base for a particular therapy's use must be developed incrementallyFirst Steps: The road from anecdote to proven efficacy \"The plural of anecdote is not evidence.\" S. Straus Therapies are in current use without scientific proof of safety, efficacy, or effectiveness How do we find out if they work? Investigator -initiated research Collaborations with NIH Institutes and Centers and other Federal agencies with specific expertiseStudy of Omega-3 Fatty Acids for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders Double- blind, placebo- controlled, RCT Comparing omega- 3 fatty acids with placebo to assess effects on Aggression and irritability Functional ability Credit: NLM MedlinePlus PI: Randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled crossover comparison trials in a single patient Patient -centered approach to testing therapeutic efficacy for symptom management Useful in patients with chronic diseases or condi tions to test short term effectsn-of-1 Controlled Trials What are they? How are they designed? Could they be useful in determining the role of CAM in the management of symptoms associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders?n-of-1 Trials: Role in testing CAM therapies for Autism Spectrum Disorders? Develops \"proof of concept\" data required before larger-scale studies are conducted Helps determine if, when (e.g., response variations), and how a therapy might be used effectively for symptom management Encourages provider, parent, patient part nershipsCAM and Autism Complementary and alternative health approaches have substantial promise to contribute to practical management of symptoms and burden of ASD on patients and their families NCCAM welcomes opportunity to partner in t rans- NIH Autism Coordinating CommitteeNational Center for Complementary "}
