Historical Popularity Ginger has a long history, spanning [more than 5,000 years](http://www.indepthinfo.com/ginger/history.shtml) and tracing back to ancient India and China, where it was hailed as a cure-all and became a staple of Asian cuisine.

Marco Polo mentioned even mentioned it in his diaries, and many historians believe that his explorations led to an overall increase in international spice trade during the 1200's. Early merchants discovered that the survival of the root as a commodity depended preservation of the plant from the site of origin to the marketplace. This gave rise to preserved ginger confections. With the age of exploration in the 15th Century, the plants were brought to the New World and planted as crops in the Caribbean and Africa.
