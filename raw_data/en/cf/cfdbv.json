Nearly 900 children are admitted annually as inpatients to the Jim and Colleen Ryan Pediatric Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at Children's Minnesota in Minneapolis, making us the largest program in the upper midwest. And while we're known as a leader and innovator in the field of pediatric cancer and blood disorder treatment, we never forget that each patient is someone's child. Compassion always factors into our approach. We are on the journey with you, because we believe that better journeys lead to better outcomes. We treat children, teens and young adults with serious medical conditions and we're known for aggressive management of pain and side effects through our interdisciplinary pain program. Our vast experience isn't the only thing that helps us to stand apart, though. Here's more on what makes us special: - Convenient care to make you more comfortable. Our [Care Closer to Home](https://www.childrensmn.org/services/care-specialties-departments/cancer-blood-disorders/locations/outreach-locations/)program allows your child to be treated closer to home whenever possible. - Advancing the understanding of rare tumors.
