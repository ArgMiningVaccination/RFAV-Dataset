For instance, both the [Pfizer/BioNTech](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine) and [Moderna](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-primary-efficacy-analysis-phase-3-cove-study) vaccines were primarily evaluated for their ability to prevent symptomatic COVID-19, with the former having a 95% efficacy and the latter having a 94% efficacy in the clinical trial data submitted for the original authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. This [means](http://fc.local/2020/12/a-guide-to-pfizer-biontechs-covid-19-vaccine/) your risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are vaccinated. The final phase 3 data showed an efficacy of [91%](https://www.fda.gov/media/151733/download) for Pfizer/BioNTech and [93%](https://www.fda.gov/media/155931/download) for Moderna. Other vaccines may report efficacy figures for infection or for moderate or severe disease. It's important to note that efficacy is the measure used in a clinical trial, and real-world performance, called effectiveness, [could be somewhat lower](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectivenessqa.htm). That's measured in observational studies. Effectiveness also can differ, depending on the variant of the virus. "}
