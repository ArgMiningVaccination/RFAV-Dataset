Steps Getting the COVID-19 Vaccine - 1Get the COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine is one of the most effective methods of preventing new infections. While you can still get COVID-19 if you're vaccinated, it's much less likely to happen\u2014and your symptoms will be much less severe.

Keep in mind that returning to pre-pandemic life is dependent on the current public health guidelines and restrictions in your region. - COVID-19 vaccines are safe for women in pregnancy. [[2]](#_note-2)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - There are several different kinds of COVID-19 vaccines available. As of July 2021, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the only vaccine currently approved for kids and teens under 18.

Contact your local health authority to see what is recommended and available to you. - Most types of COVID-19 vaccine require you to get 2 doses, about 3 weeks apart. However, if you get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you'll only need 1 dose. - 2Find a local clinic or pharmacy that offers vaccines. In many countries, the COVID-19 vaccine is free for all residents. You may be able to get the vaccine at your local pharmacy, clinic, or public health department. - In the U.S., you can find vaccination providers near you by visiting [https://www.vaccines.gov/](https://www.vaccines.gov/). You can also text your zip code to 438829 or call 1-800-232-0233 for more information.

The COVID-19 vaccine is safe for most people. However, it's common to have some mild side effects or feel a little sick afterwards. This is nothing to worry about\u2014it just means your immune system is learning how to fight the virus! Your healthcare provider may ask you to sit in the waiting room for 15 minutes after getting the shot to make sure you don't have any serious reactions, but severe side effects or allergic reactions are rare. [[5]](#_note-5)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)World Health Organization Health information and news provided by the World Health Organization [Go to source](#) - Common side effects include a soreness, redness, and mild swelling around the site of the shot. Over the next 1-2 days, you might also experience some flu-like symptoms, such as tiredness, a headache, muscle aches, nausea, and a fever or chills. - Call your doctor if you're worried about any of your side effects, or if they get worse or don't go away after 2-3 days. - 4Wait until you're fully vaccinated to go back to regular activities. For 2-dose COVID-19 vaccines, you're considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks after you get the second dose. For single dose vaccines, such as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you're fully protected 2 weeks after your initial dose. According to the CDC, once you're fully vaccinated, you can go back to doing many of the things you did before the pandemic started\u2014such as socializing with others without wearing a mask or social distancing. [[6]](#_note-6)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Until you're fully vaccinated, you'll still need to take precautions, such as wearing a mask and staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from others in public places. You're not fully protected until 2 weeks after your final dose of the vaccine! - Since there's still a small chance you could catch COVID, not all experts agree that you should go back to normal activities after getting the vaccine. The World Health Organization still recommends taking extra precautions, such as wearing a mask, washing your hands frequently, and staying at least 3 feet (0.91 m) away from others in crowded public places.

All forms of the COVID-19 vaccine that are on the market right now have been thoroughly tested, and they are safe for most people. However, your doctor might recommend avoiding it if you have certain health conditions, or if you've ever had a severe allergic reaction to another vaccine. [[8]](#_note-8)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)World Health Organization Health information and news provided by the World Health Organization [Go to source](#) Advertisement - Before you get the vaccine, your healthcare provider will ask you about your health history and any allergies you may have. - Your doctor can help you decide whether the vaccine is safe for you based on your health history.

Slip on a medical mask or face covering before you go to the grocery store or any other public area. If you unknowingly have the virus, a mask can prevent you from spreading the illness to other people. Similarly, masks can protect you from picking up the virus from other people. Board Certified Pulmonologist [[12]](#_note-12)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health [Go to source](#) - Some people with COVID-19 don't show symptoms, so they can accidentally make others sick without knowing they have the virus. Masks can help prevent this from happening. - Cloth masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of more infectious variants of COVID-19, like Delta and Omicron. Use a medical-grade mask to limit the spread and risk of infection from the current dominant variants of the coronavirus.

Don't sneeze or cough into the air\u2014this allows the virus to spread very easily. Instead, cough or sneeze into your elbow, which helps keep the germs contained. Additionally, you can sneeze or cough into a tissue and then throw that tissue out. After you've sneezed or coughed, always wash your hands thoroughly.

Board Certified Pulmonologist [[18]](#_note-18)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health [Go to source](#) - Hand sanitizers are a great alternative if you're in a rush or don't have access to soap and water. Look for products with at least 60% ethanol/ethyl alcohol, which ensures that the germs will be destroyed. - 6Ventilate shared indoor spaces with fresh air. Ventilation is important because COVID-19 spreads through the air. Opening windows at each side of a building creates cross-ventilation, allowing fresh air to come in and stale air to move out efficiently. This can improve indoor air quality and reduce the amount of COVID-19 droplets in the indoor space. - 7Sanitize high-touch surfaces each day. Think about the places in your home that are touched by a lot of people, like doorknobs, sink faucets, countertops, and tables. Each day, sanitize these surfaces with disinfectant, so you won't pick up any unwanted germs.

Your eyes, nose, and mouth are major ways you can get infected with COVID-19, especially if you're rubbing those areas with your hands. If you touch your face often, try out different habits that keep your hands distracted, like knitting, using a fidget spinner, or squeezing a stress ball.

Unfortunately, handshakes, hugs, and high-fives allow germs to spread pretty easily, and aren't the greatest option when you're meeting up with someone. Instead, think of some hands-free ways you can greet your friends and loved ones, like offering a wave. [[28]](#_note-28)X Research sourceAdvertisement Debunking Popular Myths - 1Accept that any person can come down with COVID-19. There are plenty of rumors going around about who can and can't catch the virus.

[[32]](#_note-32)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)World Health Organization Health information and news provided by the World Health Organization [Go to source](#)Instead, follow usual health practices to keep safe, like washing your hands, covering your nose and mouth when you sneeze, and wearing a mask when you go outside.

While sunlight comes with its share of health benefits, it won't give you a get-out-of-jail-free card when it comes to the virus. Instead, practice healthy habits both at home and when you're out and about, which can help reduce your risk of spreading COVID-19.
