This test kit analyses your immune system activity level To Vaccinate or Not to Vaccinate? Having been fighting the Coronavirus pandemic for over a year, COVID-19 vaccines, which have been regarded as the ultimate defence and protection solution, have finally emerged. While the vaccines have been made available to more and more countries, many people may still be pondering over their safety and effectiveness. How does the vaccine work? COVID-19 vaccination commonly consists of two doses inoculated 3-4 weeks apart, to allow time for the body to generate a corresponding immune response. The vaccine utilizes our ability to develop immunological memory to confer immunity. The first dose primes the immune system defence program by introducing \"simulated\" COVID-19 viral parts into the body. The second dose or booster, if administered within the appropriate window, will stimulate memory cells of the immune system to relaunch the programmed defences to deliver a more long-lasting and powerful protection for the individual. Is the vaccine safe for me? Vaccine manufacturers undertake rigorous clinical trials to validate their vaccine's safety and efficacy to meet the standards for granting use authorization set by local regulatory agencies (e.g., the U.S. FDA). Even after approval for use, the vaccines are still continuously being monitored to ensure prompt and appropriate address of any new issues that arise. Despite all the efforts in safety and quality control, individuals should carefully review the safety guidelines and recommendations from the vaccine manufacturers. Patients with known chronic (e.g., coronary artery disease, diabetes) or acute (e.g., fever or other flu like symptoms) health problems should always consult with a physician regarding their suitability of taking a specific vaccine. Moreover, patients should avoid inoculation if their immune system is already pre-occupied by undiagnosed asymptomatic health issues or acute illnesses. Our Pre-Vaccine Test eNano Health offers a Pre-Vaccine Test which consists of two saliva-based tests for users to use three to four days before vaccine administration. Our pre-vaccine test analyses the immune system activity level. A positive result indicates a high level of immunological activity, implying the immune system is already stressed. A stressed immune system will increase the likelihood of health complications. Users may consider deferring the vaccination until the test levels are no longer elevated and their immune system is no longer stressed. If the levels do not return to normal after repeated Pre-Vaccine tests, the user should seek professional medical advice. P4 Test This Test is one of eNano Health's saliva based P4 Test series. The P4 tests can be self-performed easily and frequently at home, empowering individuals to become aware of developing health risks at an early stage and to adapt to a personalised healthier lifestyle. Other P4 Tests targeting diabetes, cardiovascular, stroke, viral infection, stress, and smoking are also available. Please check our website for more details and releases. "}
