This is a review for travel services in Santa Clara, CA: \"Came here because I needed some help verifying my vaccination for the I-693 form. The place was easy to find in a strip mall slightly off El Camino. Plenty of parking, easy to book an appointment. Mostly asian staff, sometimes their english is not perfect but they are all very kind. I was happy they ran antibody tests first, instead of shooting me full of vaccines. They have a nice streamlined process and I had my forms in a few days. "}
