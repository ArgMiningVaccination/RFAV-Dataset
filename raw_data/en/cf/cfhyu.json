Best, MD1 Audrey Young, MD21Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, Washington. 2Evergreen Hospital and Medical Center, Kirkland, Washington. Disclosure: Nothing to report. Homeless patients suffer disproportionately from medical disease and from barriers to healthcare, affecting their likelihood of presentation, severity of disease, long-term outcomes, and mortality. In the hospital, homeless patients are frequently cared for by hospitalists. Homeless patients' unstable social situation may challenge usual systems of inpatient care and discharge. To provide more effective care for this group, it is important to recognize the demographics of the hospitalized homeless patient. We suggest a structured approach to the inpatient care of the unstably housed patient, represented by a simple mnemonic checklist '' A SAFE DC,'' describing evidence-based adaptations of care, where available, and discussing systems-based approaches to discharge.

KEYWORDS: care standardization, continuity of care, practice-based learning and improvement, transition and discharge planning. Homeless patients are admitted to the hospital more fre- quently for both medical and psychiatric conditions as com- pared with domiciled but otherwise similar patients.1-3They are also more likely to be hospitalized for conditions usually managed in the outpatient setting, such as cellulitis and re- spiratory infections.3-5Physicians have reported a lower threshold for admission of patients whose conditions will worsen on the streets.4Homeless inpatients are typically younger and may be hospitalized for longer than compara- ble patients with housing, often at higher cost.4,5These patients suffer from an average of 8 to 9 active medical problems6and markedly increased mortality,7-10with an av- erage life expectancy of 45 years.7Many homeless patients are uninsured or underinsured11,12and receive no ambula- tory medical care.11These patients are often cared for by hospitalists. A general understanding of the unique needs of the homeless population is paramount for the hospitalist who strives to provide high-quality care. The most commonly referenced denition of ''homelessness'' from the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act denes a home- less person as an individual who lacks a xed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence or a person who resides in a shelter, welfare hotel, transitional program, or place not or- dinarily used as regular sleeping accommodations, such as streets, cars, movie theaters, abandoned buildings, or on the streets.13This denition is often extended to include those who are occasionally but unstably housed with family or friends.14Undomiciled and unstably housed patients face many barriers in obtaining healthcare, including cognitive or developmental impairment, cultural or linguistic issues, unreliable means of transportation, inability to pay for med- ications and supplies, and addiction and substance abuse.Systemic barriers include inadequate health insurance, lim- ited access to health services, and provider bias or igno- rance toward the issues of homelessness. A hospitalist working with homeless patients may be dis- couraged by perceived inability to arrange reliable follow-up or may be frustrated by hospital readmission resulting from patient noncompliance. Commonly, crisis management takes precedence over addressing the fundamental issues of homelessness.15,16Managing transitions of care at discharge, a vulnerable time for all hospitalized patients,17is often par- ticularly difcult when a patient has no place to go. We present here a review of selected literature that may inform care of the hospitalized homeless inpatient, providing back- ground information on burden of disease, and supplement- ing this with evidence-based and consensus-based recom- mendations for adaptations of care. Additionally, we propose a simple mnemonic checklist, '' A SAFE DC,'' and discuss systems-based approaches to the challenges of pro- viding care to this population. A SAFE DC: A Conceptual Framework for Care of the Homeless Inpatient The mnemonic checklist '' A SAFE DC'' is an acronym for the 7 parts of a conceptual framework for care of the homeless inpatient (Table 1). A: Assess Housing Situation Hospitals are not required to collect homelessness data. Where such data are collected, they are often inaccurate and internally inconsistent. In 1 survey of inpatients at a public hospital, over 25% of inpatients met strict criteria for homelessness.18Effective discharge planning begins on 2009 Society of Hospital Medicine DOI 10.1002/jhm.568 Published online in wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com). Journal of Hospital Medicine Vol 4 No 6 July/August 2009 375admission.15Hospitalists should ask specically about hous- ing status at the onset of hospitalization.19This should be done in a direct, yet sensitive, manner. Given the recent economic downturn, increasing numbers of individuals and families are marginally housed; these patients may not showoutward signs of homelessness and may not volunteer this information during the initial encounter. Be aware that some patients may become homeless during hospitaliza-tion, 18often as a result of inability to work or attend to - nancial matters during an inpatient stay. Resultant medical debt is a common cause of personal bankruptcy and home-lessness following discharge. Although it is accepted that a patient should be medi- cally stable prior to discharge and that the decision to dis-charge should be based on medical, not nancial considera- tions, 20,21other standards for discharge vary from provider to provider. Hospitalists may be more cautious in discharg-ing a patient without a stable home, 4yet facilitating outpa- tient follow-up care or arranging transfer to a sheltered, structured environment can lengthen the hospital stay.Many cities offer formal medical respite care in a number of forms well described in the literature, including free-stand-ing 22-25or shelter-based units,25,26or skilled nursing facili- ties that contract directly with hospitals for short stays. One innovative model is the ''hoptel,'' or hospital hotel,27a tem- porary housing facility proximate to the hospital to which self-sufcient homeless patients may be discharged for recuperation. Some hospitals distribute motel vouchers atdischarge. 22,25All of these options provide opportunities for rest and recovery. Some facilities are staffed with a nurse who can check vital signs and provide wound care. Respitedischarge may decrease early readmission and death rates 23 and decrease repeat hospitalizations,24particularly in human immunodeciency virus (HIV) patients. The National Health Care for the Homeless Council (NHCHC) maintains a national map and directory of respite care programs and services (see Table 2). Hospital providersshould develop familiarity with all programs offered in a given geographic area and work closely with case managers and social workers to ensure that a homeless patient is con-sidered for all programs for which he or she is eligible. S: Screening and Prevention In addition to treating the presenting condition, a hospitalistshould evaluate homeless patients for disease processes common in indigence. A full physical examination, prefera- bly unclothed, is also recommended. 28Homelessness mark- edly individual's risk of chronic medical condi- tions. Reactive airway disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occur at higher rates as a resultof tobacco and inhalational drug abuse. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic liver and renal disease mayTABLE 1.

Peripheral vascular disease is 10to 15 times more frequent than in the general popula- tion. 16,28,29Tuberculosis, with prevalence rates greater than 30 times the national average,30and other communicable diseases, including HIV , hepatitis B, and hepatitis C,16are exceedingly prevalent and in some cases endemic.12Infesta- tions are also common. One out of 5 Health Care for theHomeless clients has an infectious or communicable dis- ease. 16Up to two-thirds of homeless individuals are HIV- positive, with younger, Hispanic, and black populations athighest risk. 29Systemic infections may be traced to poor dentition, common in this population. Poor vision and skin conditions, also rampant,30are easily overlooked in acute care encounters. The rate of drug and alcohol abuse in the homeless population may be as high as 8 times that of the general population.31In 1 survey of homeless adults, the majority identied substance abuse as a major factor in ongoing homelessness.32Mental illness prevalence in the may be as high as 80% to 95%33and street violence is com- monplace; more than 50% of homeless women have been sexually assaulted.11 There is a paucity of data on the effectiveness of inpa- tient health interventions for the homeless. In a 2005 sys- tematic review of 45 studies evaluating the impact of vari- ous programs on homeless health, only 1 targeted aninpatient population. 34Furthermore, the literature suggests that street-based or shelter-based delivery of preventative services is most effective for undomiciled patients.35Under- standing these limitations, inpatient admission remains an opportunity to offer services that may decrease morbidity. Evidence-based preventative measures (Table 3) include vaccination against hepatitis A and hepatitis B in the intra- venous drug-using homeless population. An acceleratedhepatitis B vaccine administration schedule, with doses at 0, 7, and 21 days and a booster at 12 months, has been shown to increase completion rates. 36Drug users should be advised to utilize needle exchange programs and avoid shar- ing equipment. Sexually active homeless patients should be counseled regarding safe sexual practices and condom use.Consider tuberculosis screening with puried protein deriv- ative (PPD) testing and spot sputum check, which havebeen shown in a shelter-based intervention to detect an infection rate of 3.1%. 37Notably, within that cohort, symp- tom-based screening was not found to be helpful. Influenza, diphtheria, tetanus, and pneumococcal vaccinations are also recommended, but have not been studied in regard to sec-ondary decrease of infection rates in the homeless. Admission to the hospital should be considered a ''treat- able moment'' for substance abuse. In focus groups ofhomeless smokers, 76% of participants expressed intention to quit within 6 months and all were interested in using pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments. 38In another study comparing admitted homeless vs. domiciled sub- stance-using adults, a higher percentage of the homeless patients were found to be in the action stage of change, ascompared with the precontemplative or contemplative stage. 39When ongoing use is likely, recommended strategies include advocating for safer routes or patterns or use andpraising small successes on the continuum to abstinence. 40 Where such services are available, the hospitalist shouldcoordinate with primary care providers (PCPs) and socialworkers to refer patients for drug treatment and rehabilita- tion. Likewise, mental health follow-up should be conrmed and ongoing care coordinated with the patient's mentalhealth case worker, if one exists. A: Address Primary Care Issues The inpatient setting is often a homeless patient's only ongoing source of medical care, but may not meet all of his or her healthcare needs. During an admission for congestiveheart failure (CHF), for example, he or she may receive diu- resis and afterload reduction but not ''outpatient'' interven- tions such lipid and blood pressure management. Chronicdiagnoses, such as malignancy, may be viewed as secondary and remain unaddressed. Questions about extent of a hospi- talist's obligations to provide primary care arise in caseswhere a patient has failed to establish (and the system failed to provide) an outpatient medical home. Just as emergency department physicians have become de facto primary care providers for underserved patients, hospitalists can expect to provide routine care for patients facing homelessness. Some interventions traditionally con-sidered outpatient services, such as pneumococcal vaccina- tion or counseling regarding smoking cessation, are now identied as inpatient core quality measures. Whether sexu-ally transmitted disease or colon cancer screening or evalua- tion of cardiac risk status, for example, should become inpa- tient services for medically indigent patients is open fordebate. Whenever possible, our goal is to facilitate screening and specialty consultations in the inpatient setting when this will not unnecessarily prolong hospitalization. F: Follow-Up Care Ideally, transfer of care occurs smoothly between the hospi-talist and a PCP or specialist who will provide a patient's ongoing medical care. Because many homeless patients lackTABLE 3.

A SAFE DC Best and Young 377or cannot identify a consistent outpatient provider, they may require additional assistance to ensure they receivemedical care after discharge. If the patient has a PCP , the hospitalist should initiate contact with this individual at admission and discharge, forwarding relevant records in atimely fashion, including a faxed or electronic discharge summary. We often provide patients with a hard copy of the discharge summary and ask them to hand-carry it toany follow-up appointments. When a patient has no PCP , the hospitalist should attempt to expedite establishment of primary care. Unfortunately, many communities have lim-ited primary care availability for patients who lack health in- surance, posing challenges for hospital providers and patients. At our institution, follow-up appointments are often made by a clerk or nurse who later relays the appointment date and time to the patient. Some clinics collect contact in-formation and call the patient themselves. There are fre- quent lapses in this scheduling system; some patients never receive a follow-up appointment because they have nomeans of contact. Providing a scheduled follow-up date and time prior to discharge may circumvent this problem. 41 It is also optimal if some options for follow-up care do not require a previously scheduled appointment. At ourinstitution, a postdischarge ''aftercare'' clinic lls this need for patients without an established PCP , until such a rela- tionship can be established. appointments aredesigned to address specic, time-critical, clinical issues (eg, assessing response to antibiotics, follow-up creatinine in patient on diuretics, etc). To the degree that it is possible,selecting a site for follow-up care that minimizes transporta-tion (eg, a shelter-based clinic) may improve the likelihood of follow-up. It is wise to ask the patient when and where he or she would prefer to be seen. Consider that eveningappointments may be best for day workers. 28Some authors have advocated that providers consider dispensing fewer numbers of medications at any given time, in order toenhance compliance with the follow-up appointments, 28 even if this may not reflect optimal medical management. Careful consideration should be given before ordering tests for which results may not be available prior to antici-pated discharge. These may include microbiological cul- tures, pathology reports, or sexually transmitted disease screening, including HIV testing. Note that even when apatient does have an established PCP , the hospitalist's liabil- ity for medical care may persist after hospital discharge. Emergency room physicians, for example, have been found liable for lack of postdischarge communication of radiologic ndings. 42 Timely and thorough documentation is critical. In many cases, a hospitalist is the only physician aware of a home- less patient's active medical issues. On admission, recordsshould be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that pressing con- cerns, even those not traditionally requiring hospitalization, are addressed in a timely fashion. Detailed discharge docu-mentation helps to ensure that ongoing issues are not lostduring follow-up. It may be useful to provide a given patient with a portable summary of his or her medical history forself-reference and facilitation of ongoing care, particularly for those with a history of seeking healthcare at multiple facilities. 28 E: End-of-Life Discussions Given the increased mortality and decreased life expectancyof the homeless population, an acute care hospitalization provides an excellent opportunity to discuss end-of-life pref- erences, particularly if the patient does not have an estab-lished PCP . Focus groups have noted little difference in the range of end-of-life preferences of the homeless as com- pared with the general population, yet a common fearamong the homeless is that of an anonymous death, or a ''life without remembrance.'' 43Many homeless patients believe that physicians would use deceit in withdrawinglife-sustaining support or that their body might be disposed of without consent. They identify advance directives as a way to regain control over their lives. 44It is important to obtain and update emergency contacts for friends and fam- ily on each admission. Notably, homeless people often des- ignate an unrelated friend or associate as their decisionmaker, rather than family, and express that it is less impor- tant to have family present at their death as it is to be cared for compassionately and respectfully by those who arepresent. 44 D: Discharge Instructions Simple and Realistic Health illiteracy profoundly affects homeless patients. In thepredischarge narratives of 21 low-income urban medical inpatients, almost one-half believed it would be impossible to follow medical advice at discharge. 45Healthcare providers may overestimate a patient's ability to understand discharge instructions46and to provide self-care at the time of dis- charge.47Homeless patients are at high risk for disease relapse following discharge, given chaotic living conditions and lack of social support.1The presence of community support has been shown to decrease the likelihood of rehospitalization.48 Medication compliance poses a particular challenge. In 1 study, one-third of homeless patients reported inability to comply with medications.2Cost, storage capability, and complexity of regimen are common obstacles. Side effectsshould be considered when medications are selected, since common side effects like gastrointestinal upset or diarrhea, or desired effects like diuresis, may be intolerable if apatient cannot reliably access a restroom. Physicians should also weigh the possibility that discharge medications and supplies may be abused or stolen on the streets. Difcultyaccessing routine meals can be particularly problematic in homeless patients with diabetes, who must eat on a regular schedule in order to avoid hypoglycemia. Diabetic goalsmay be adjusted accordingly to minimize risk. Diet may also be an issue if a patient must take a medication with 2009 Society of Hospital Medicine DOI 10.1002/jhm.568 Published online in wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com). 378 Journal of Hospital Medicine Vol 4 No 6 July/August 2009food, as with some antiretrovirals. The physician must anticipate an erratic diet and, whenever possible, dose med-ications accordingly. Directly observed therapy for diseases such as tuberculosis is optimal if the ability to comply is in question. 28The NHCHC has developed guidelines for adap- tations of care in homeless patients with a variety of clinical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, HIV , cardiovascular disease, and asthma; these are available for reference anddownload on their website (Table 2). Illiteracy and low educational level also impact compli- ance. In 1 sample of indigent psychiatric patients, 76% readat or below the seventh grade level. 49Aftercare instructions should be easy to understand by those with lower levels of education (fourth grade level or less), written down in sim-ple language, and reviewed verbally by nurse, pharmacist, and physician. Consider initiating projects within your hos- pital to streamline discharge instruction forms. 50The use of pictorial or video-assisted discharge instructions for com- mon diagnoses is an area of promise.17,51,52 Of note, there is no body of literature addressing the extent to which hospitalists or other inpatient physicians al- ter treatment goals at the time of discharge for homeless patients, but this may be a common occurrence and war-rants further study. C: Communication Methods After Discharge Before discharge, clarify how a patient can be contacted for additional test results or information regarding follow-up appointments. Although some homeless patients maintainmobile phones, telephone-based methods used by some hospitalists for postdischarge follow-up 53,54may be unreli- able in this population. Some shelters or respite facilitieswill accept messages for clients who reside there; others will provide clients with access to voicemail or e-mail. For those patients who are technologically savvy, free e-mail accountscan readily be obtained and accessed at public facilities, such as the public library. Contact information for a case manager can also be very useful. We occasionally askpatients to return to the hospital to retrieve test results or a message from their physician at a predetermined time and place. Where safe and appropriate, providing patients withdirect physician contact information (rather than general hospital information) may minimize communication barriers. The Big Picture: Systems-Based Approaches to the Discharge of Homeless Patients The discharge of homeless patients is suited to a compre- hensive, interdisciplinary approach. There are many chal- lenges to effective discharge planning: lack of time, lack ofprocess ownership at the institutional level, nancial con- straints, and perhaps most signicantly, lack of consensus regarding best practices. 19There is growing acknowledge- ment of the need to develop policies and standardize prac- tice in this area. Hospitalists are uniquely situated to con-tribute to the development of new initiatives at the institutional, local, and national level. Interventions (Table 4) may be as simple as the identi- cation of a dedicated social worker for all homeless dis- charges15,21,55or creation of a hospital-wide discharge plan- ning committee or inpatient homeless consultationservice. 15,21The distribution of discharge planning guides for patients and resource lists to providers is also gaining in popularity.21,56Some innovations specically target clini- cians, such as training seminars that teach communication skills and motivational interviewing and build familiarity with safety-net services within the community.21,57Commu- nity-based programs include medical respite care services, previously discussed, and the facilitation of ''preferred pro- vider'' relationships directed by hospitals toward skillednursing facilities willing to accept homeless and other chal- lenging clients. 15 Homelessness has also been identied as an area of focus by state governments, with many states funding initiatives to improve training and assistance to homeless providers, policies for discharge planning from public institutions, andhomeless needs assessments. Some states have gone so far as to determine that discharge to an emergency shelter is ''not appropriate.'' 19On the national level, large advocacy organizations such as the NHCHC and National Coalition for the Homeless have spearheaded ''Housing First'' efforts on behalf of homeless patients and providers throughoutthe country. Such programs have been shown to decrease healthcare expenditures, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations in certain homeless populations. 58,59Check the NHCHC website for consolidated discharge planning program development resources for healthcare institutions (http://www.nhchc.org; see Table 2 for additional links). Commentary Homeless patients frequently require more energy and serv-ices at the time of service in order to achieve standard med-ical care. Optimally, a patient assumes full responsibility for his or her health, but there may be limits to this responsibil- ity for selected patients, 60especially in light of limited access to primary care. Understandably, homeless patients may focus more on immediate physical needs (eg, food,TABLE 4.

In addi- tion, they may experience a sense of ''unwelcomeness'' fromhealthcare providers that they perceive as discrimination; this may dissuade them from seeking care. 61The inpatient physician should aim to build trust with each encounter. Assuggested by 1 author, it is important to ''promise only what can be delivered and deliver what is promised.'' 62Involving the patient in care and decision-making is the most impor-tant rst step in accomplishing this goal. It is important in caring for homeless patients to reframe one's notion of a ''successful outcome.'' 16Ideally, on resolu- tion of his or her acute medical issues, a homeless patient would be discharged to permanent housing with substance abuse and mental health treatment. This scenario isunfortunately rare. The hospitalist often has little ability to arrange stable, on-demand housing at discharge. He or she is best advised to focus on optimizing acute care delivery atthe point of care and maximize opportunities for future health. It has been suggested that the discontinuity inherent in the hospitalist model may confer a special obligation on hospital medicine providers to abide by a more rigorous standard of care 42; one might argue that this obligation becomes even more compelling when applied to this vul- nerable population. In 1 study, a disturbing 27% of an American cohort of homeless adults had no healthcare con-tacts in the year prior to death, underscoring this group's underutilization of health services. Armed with this knowl- edge, hospitalists should seize every healthcare interactionas an opportunity to offer therapies with potential for lon- ger-term benet.
