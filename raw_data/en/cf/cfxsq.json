It can be taken as a research topic by the knowledge seekers. Chemical composition of Brinjal: The eggplant is abundant in phenolic compounds in the fruit (chlorogenic acid) and it is the most common allergen to human beings. Eggplant is high in histamines which is another factor for allergic manifestations. Rationality on the basis of Ayurvedic principles: Brinjal is Kapha-pittavardhaka (increases Kapha in their respective places of occupation(site). Due to this, free movement of the dhatus (tissues) especially in Rasa, Rakta (blood), Mamsa (muscle) and Meda (fat) tissue are obstructed. Hence dhatwagni dushti (altered metabolism at tissue level)is caused. Further in turn it leads low digestion strength at tissue level (dhatu Agnimandya) and dhatu vaishamya - vitiation / imbalance in tissues. This leads to tissue toxicity. This leads to sepsis (dhatwagnimandyajanya vishaktata) and thus becomes the reason for all ailments associated with skin. This acts as a hurdle for the medicine action leading to medicinal toxicity (oushadha Ajeernata). Thus it increases the burden of the skin disease treatment. Probably with this reason the tradition as well as Ayurverdic practice restricts the usage of brinjal in such cases that too in skin diseases or blood borne diseases of any king including blisters, abscess, cysts, boils, itching skin lesions, eczema, allergic dermatitis, tinea infection etc. I will be eagerly waiting to get more explanation in this regard.
