Disruption andhomogenization are achieved through the beating and grinding effect of beads on thesample material as they are shaken together in the grinding vessels. Disruption is critically important in order to release the nucleic acids from the sample material. Homogenization of the material acts to shear the high-molecular-weightcellular proteins and carbohydrates that may otherwise reduce binding of DNA andRNA to silica membranes or magnetic particles. Sample disruption using, for example,a mortar and pestle does not result in efficient homogenization. The TissueLyser bothdisrupts and homogenizes sample material in one simple and reliable step. The TissueLyser is easily programmed to provide variable speeds from 3 to 30 Hz (180-1800 oscillations/minute) and run times from 10 seconds to 99 minutes. Applications The ability to process up to 192 samples per run makes the TissueLyser the ideal front-end solution to access biological information TissueLyser is the disruption instrument of choice. The TissueLyser enables fast and uniform disruption of animal and human tissues, plant tissues, bacteria, and yeast in various sample volumes in several formats. QIAGENoffers adapter sets for 2 x 96 collection microtubes (1.2 ml) or 2 x 24 microcentrifugetubes (2 ml) as well as stainless steel and tungsten carbide beads. For disruption of largesamples, grinding jar sets (10 ml) with stainless steel or Teflon \u00aegrinding balls are also available from QIAGEN. For more details about these and other accessories for theTissueLyser, see Appendix A (page 27). The TissueLyser provides efficient disruption of biological material in each sample vessel for reproducible, high-quality results in downstream applications such as the purificationof total DNA or RNA from a variety of human, animal, and plant tissues. A wide rangeof QIAGEN sample purification kits are compatible with the TissueLyser (see Tables1-6, pages 7-10). Sample purification can be performed manually or can beautomated using the QIAcube \u00ae, QIAsymphonySP, EZ1\u00aeAdvanced, or BioRobot\u00aeor BioSprint\u00aeworkstations. more information Appendix B (page 29).TissueLyser Handbook 10/2010 7This handbook provides guidelines on disrupting and homogenizing various sample materials for subsequent purification of DNA or RNA. Specific details on disruption andhomogenization and nucleic acid purification, such as the amount of starting materialand lysis buffer to use, can be found in the handbook supplied with each QIAGENsample purification kit.

Disruption and homogenizationare 2 distinct steps: I Disruption : Complete disruption of cell walls and plasma membranes of cells and organelles is absolutely required to release all the nucleic acids contained in thesample. Different samples require different methods to achieve completedisruption. Incomplete disruption results in significantly reduced DNA and RNAyields. I Homogenization : Homogenization is necessary to reduce the viscosity of the cell lysates produced by disruption. Homogenization shears the high-molecular-weightcellular proteins and carbohydrates to create a homogeneous lysate. Incompletehomogenization results in inefficient binding of nucleic acids to QIAGEN silicamembranes and magnetic particles and therefore significantly reduced DNA andRNA yields. Cellular disruption is one of the most critical steps in nucleic acid purification. Disruption in lysis buffer alone, without physical shearing, may result in nucleic acid degradationby endogenous DNases nucleases, from contacting nucleic acids within the intact cells.Furthermore, cellular debris that is not disrupted can result in decreased yield andincreases the risk of clogging the purification column. After sample disruption, thereshould be no visible particulates (except when disrupting materials containing hard,noncellular components, such as connective tissue, bone, or woody plant tissue).QIAGEN kits and protocols contain recommendations for the most appropriate methodof sample disruption and homogenization to maximize the yield and quality of yourDNA and RNA preparation. Disruption and homogenization using the TissueLyser In bead-milling, cells and tissues can be disrupted by rapid agitation in the presence ofbeads. Disruption and simultaneous homogenization occur by the shearing andcrushing action of the beads as they collide with the sample. Disruption efficiency isinfluenced by: ISize and composition of beads IRatio of buffer to samples (if buffer is used) IAmount of starting material IConfiguration of TissueLyser (i.e., speed and duration) IConsistency of of disruption vessel14 TissueLyser Handbook 10/2010Disruption and homogenization methods When using the TissueLyser in combination with QIAGEN sample purification kits, one of 2 methods for disruption and homogenization is carried out: samples are eitherdisrupted and homogenized in lysis buffer at room temperature, or precooled and thendisrupted and homogenized without lysis buffer. With the latter method, lysis buffer isadded after disruption and homogenization. The method of precooling samples depends on the TissueLyser accessory used. If using the TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 24 or TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 96, the adapter setshould be stored at -80\u00b0C for at least 2 hours prior to starting disruption andhomogenization, and the tubes containing the samples should be precooled on dry ice.If using a Grinding Jar Set, the jar containing the sample can be frozen in liquid nitrogenprior to starting disruption and homogenization. Important : When using a TissueLyser Adapter Set, do not freeze the adapter set or the sample tubes in liquid nitrogen, as this may result in breakage of the tubes. In special cases (e.g., the disruption of teeth or plant seeds), the sample can be disrupted and homogenized at room temperature without lysis buffer, although thisincreases the risk of nucleic acid degradation by nucleases. Bead selection For disruption of small samples, the optimal beads to use are 0.1-0.6 mm (mean diameter) glass beads for bacteria, 0.5 mm glass beads for yeast and unicellular animalcells, and 3-7 mm stainless steel or tungsten carbide beads for plant andanimal/human tissues. It is essential that glass beads are pretreated use (acid-washed) beads can bepurchased from many vendors of biological supplies (e.g., Sigma, cat. nos. G1145,G1277, and G8772 ). Disruption parameters for samples not addressed in this handbook must be determined empirically. For disruption of large samples, a GrindingJar Set can be used, which is supplied with either stainless steel grinding balls (fordisrupting hard samples such as bone or for disrupting samples in liquid nitrogen) orTeflon grinding balls (for disrupting most samples). Note: Do not use Buffer RLT, Buffer RLT Plus, or QIAzol \u00aeLysis Reagent in conjunction beads. These buffers react chemically with tungsten carbide,causing damage to the bead surface. * When working with chemicals, always wear a suitable lab coat, disposable gloves, and protective goggles. For more information, consult the appropriate material safety data sheets (MSDSs), available fromthe product supplier. This is not a complete list of suppliers and does not include many important vendors of biological supplies.TissueLyser Handbook 10/2010 15Operating the TissueLyser The TissueLyser Adapter Set or Grinding Jar Set should be securely fixed into the clamps (arms) of the TissueLyser. For details, refer to the operating instructions supplied with theTissueLyser. Disruption is carried out in high-speed (20-30 Hz) shaking steps. Disruption for 2 x 3 minutes at 20-30 Hz is usually sufficient to release RNA. If disrupting samples forsubsequent DNA purification, disruption times should be shorter in order to preventDNA shearing. When using a TissueLyser Adapter Set, samples nearer to the TissueLyser move more slowly than samples further away from the TissueLyser. To ensure uniform disruption andhomogenization, 2 shaking steps should be carried out. After the first shaking step, theTissueLyser Adapter Set should be disassembled and the rack of tubes should be rotatedso that the tubes that were nearest to the TissueLyser are now outermost. The TissueLyserAdapter Set should then be reassembled before continuing with the second shakingstep. For optimal operation, the TissueLyser should always be balanced. A balance can be provided by assembling a second TissueLyser Adaptor Set with a rack of tubescontaining only disruption beads, and fixing this adaptor set into the empty clamp. Ifusing grinding jars, the balance should consist of a second grinding jar containing agrinding ball. Disruption and homogenization in Buffer RLT Plus RNeasy Plus Kits and certain AllPrep Kits are supplied with Buffer RLT Plus, a lysis bufferthat provides optimal sample lysis as well as appropriate conditions for DNA bindingto gDNA Eliminator columns or AllPrep DNA columns. When disrupting andhomogenizing tissues in Buffer RLT Plus, excessive foaming may occur. This foaming issubstantially reduced by adding Reagent DX to Buffer RLT Plus at a final concentrationof 0.5% (v/v) before starting disruption and homogenization. Reagent DX has beencarefully tested with RNeasy Plus Kits and AllPrep Kits, and has no effect on RNA purityor on downstream applications such as real-time RT-PCR. Buffer RLT Plus containingReagent DX can be stored at room temperature (15-25\u00b0C) for at least 9 months.Reagent DX is supplied separately; for ordering information, see page 32.Animal/Human Tissues (RNA) 16 TissueLyser Handbook 10/2010Protocol: Purification of RNA or Multiple Analytes from Animal and Human Tissues This protocol provides guidelines on disrupting animal and human tissues for purification of RNA or for simultaneous purification of DNA and RNA or DNA, RNA,and protein. If using a QIAGEN sample purification kit (see Tables 1, 2, and 6 on pages7, 8, and 10), refer to the supplied handbook, which contains a complete protocol forsample disruption and purification. Important points before starting IBefore beginning the procedure, read \"Important Notes\" (page 13). IEnsure that you are familiar with operating the TissueLyser by referring to the operating instructions. IIf using a QIAGEN sample purification kit, read the supplied handbook carefullybefore starting. IAfter storage in RNA laterRNA Stabilization Reagent or Allprotect Tissue Reagent, tissues become slightly hard. If disrupting in Buffer RLT, we recommend increasingthe volume of this buffer according to the protocols in the RNeasy Mini Handbook . In addition, the disruption time may be need to be extended. Procedure 1. Place the tissues in 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes or 1.2 ml collection microtubes containing 1 stainless steel bead (3-7 mm mean diameter). If handling fresh or frozen tissue samples, keep the tubes on dry ice. 2. Place the tubes at room temperature (15-25\u00b0C). Immediately add the appropriate volume of lysis buffer (e.g., Buffer RLT, Buffer RLT Plus, or QIAzol Reagent) or Lysis Reagent with tungsten carbide beads, as these buffers can react with and damage the bead surface. Note: If using Buffer RLT Plus, we recommend adding Reagent DX to prevent excessive foaming. For details, see \"Disruption and homogenization in Buffer RLTPlus\" (page 15). 3. Place the tubes in the TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 24 (if using 2 ml tubes) or the TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 96 (if using 1.2 ml tubes).Animal/Human Tissues (RNA) TissueLyser Handbook 10/2010 174. Operate the TissueLyser for 2 min at 20-30 Hz. Disassemble the adapter set, rotate the rack of tubes so that the tubes nearest to the TissueLyser are now outermost,and reassemble the adapter set. Operate the TissueLyser for another 2 min at20-30 Hz. The duration of disruption and homogenization depends on the tissue being processed and can be extended until no tissue debris is visible. Rearranging the tubes ensures uniform disruption and homogenization.If processing fiber-rich tissues, complete disruption and homogenization may sometimes not be possible. However, small amounts of debris have no effect onsubsequent RNA purification with QIAGEN kits and are usually digested in theproteinase K step. 5. Proceed with RNA, DNA/RNA, or DNA/RNA/protein purification. Do not reuse the stainless steel beads.Plant Tissues (RNA) 18 TissueLyser Handbook 10/2010Protocol: Purification of RNA from Plant Tissues This protocol provides guidelines on disrupting plant tissues for subsequent RNA purification.

IEnsure that you are familiar with operating the TissueLyser by referring to the operating instructions. IIf using a QIAGEN kit for RNA purification, read the supplied handbook carefullybefore starting. ISoft, fresh tissues from plants such as Nicotiana and Arabidopsis can often bedisrupted and homogenized in lysis buffer. Hard tissues (e.g., woody plantmaterials) may require freezing and disruption under frozen conditions. Procedure 1. If handling frozen tissues, precool the TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 24 or TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 96 by storing at -80\u00b0C for at least 2 h. The adapter sets do not need to be precooled if handling fresh tissues. 2. Place the tissues in 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes or 1.2 ml collection microtubes containing 1 stainless steel bead (3-7 mm mean diameter). If handling frozentissues, keep the tubes on dry ice. Note: Do not freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen, as this may lead to breakage of the tubes. 3. Immediately add the appropriate volume of lysis buffer (e.g., Buffer RLT or Buffer RLC) to each tube. If handling frozen tissues, do not add lysis buffer. Note: Do not use Buffer RLT or Buffer RLC with tungsten carbide beads, as these buffers can react with and damage the bead surface. 4. Place the tubes in the TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 24 (if using 2 ml tubes) or the TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 96 (if using 1.2 ml tubes). * If using the RNeasy 96 Kit, refer to supplementary protocol Isolation of total RNA from plants using the RNeasy 96 Kit (RY23).Plant Tissues (RNA) TissueLyser Handbook 10/2010 195. Operate the TissueLyser for 1 min at 30 Hz. Disassemble the adapter set, rotate the rack of tubes so that the tubes nearest to the TissueLyser are now outermost,and reassemble the adapter set. Operate the TissueLyser for another 1 min at30 Hz. The duration of disruption and homogenization depends on the tissue being processed and can be extended until no tissue debris is visible. If necessary, keepthe samples on dry ice for several minutes in between the individual disruptionsteps to avoid thawing of the samples. Rearranging the tubes ensures uniform disruption and homogenization. 6. Proceed with RNA purification. If frozen samples were disrupted, add lysis buffer, and proceed with RNA purification. Do not reuse the stainless steel beads.Bacteria (RNA) 20 TissueLyser Handbook 10/2010Protocol: Purification of RNA from Bacteria This protocol provides guidelines on disrupting bacteria for subsequent RNA purification.

IIf using a QIAGEN kit for DNA purification, read the supplied handbook carefullybefore starting. IFresh, frozen, or lyophilized tissues can be processed. Fresh tissues can bedisrupted in lysis buffer at ambient temperature. Alternatively, fresh or frozentissues can be disrupted without lysis buffer if they are precooled on dry ice andif the adapter sets are precooled at -80\u00b0C for at least 2 h. Lyophilized tissues canbe disrupted without lysis buffer at ambient temperature. Disruption of tissues inlysis buffer yields DNA ideal for PCR, while disruption of tissues in liquid nitrogenyields DNA of a higher molecular weight. We do not recommend disruptingfrozen tissues in lysis buffer as this results in low yields and degraded DNA. Procedure 1. If purifying DNA of higher molecular weight from fresh or frozen tissues, precool the TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 24 or TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 96 by storing at-80\u00b0C for at least 2 h. The adapter sets do not need to be precooled if disrupting fresh tissues in lysis buffer or if disrupting lyophilized tissues. 2. Place the tissues in 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes or 1.2 ml collection microtubes containing 1 tungsten carbide bead (3 mm mean diameter). 3. If purifying DNA of higher molecular weight from fresh or frozen tissues, precool the tubes by storing on dry ice. Note: Do not freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen, as this may lead to breakage of the tubes. The tubes do not need to be precooled if disrupting fresh tissues in lysis buffer or if disrupting lyophilized tissues. Plant Tissues Mini (DNA) 24 TissueLyser Handbook 10/20104. If necessary, add an appropriate volume of lysis buffer (e.g., Buffer AP1) to each tube. Lysis buffer must not be added if disrupting precooled tissues or if disrupting lyophilized tissues. 5. Place the tubes in the TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 24 (if using 2 ml tubes) or TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 96 (if using 1.2 ml tubes). 6. Operate the TissueLyser for 1 min at 25 Hz. Disassemble the adapter set, rotate the rack of tubes so that the tubes nearest to the TissueLyser are now outermost,and reassemble the adapter set. Operate the TissueLyser for another 1 min at25 Hz. Note: If processing precooled tissues, increasing the disruption time may lead to thawing and reduced DNA yield and quality. 7. Add lysis buffer (e.g., Buffer AP1) if necessary, and proceed with DNA purification. The tungsten carbide beads can be reused. For details on recovering and cleaning beads, refer to the DNeasy Plant Handbook .TissueLyser Handbook 10/2010 25Protocol: Purification of DNA from Plant Tissues (Maxi Protocol) This protocol provides guidelines on using a Grinding Jar Set to disrupt plant tissues for subsequent DNA purification. If using the DNeasy Plant Maxi Kit for DNA purification(see Table 5, page 10), refer to the supplied DNeasy Plant Handbook , which contains a complete protocol for sample disruption and DNA purification. Important points before starting IBefore beginning the procedure, read \"Important Notes\" (page 13). IEnsure that you are familiar with operating the TissueLyser by referring to the operating instructions. IIf using the DNeasy Plant Maxi Kit for DNA purification, read the suppliedhandbook carefully before starting. IFresh, frozen, or lyophilized tissues can be processed. Fresh tissues can bedisrupted in lysis buffer at ambient temperature. Alternatively, fresh or frozentissues can be disrupted without lysis buffer if the jar containing the sample isfrozen in liquid nitrogen. Lyophilized tissues can be disrupted without lysis bufferat ambient temperature. Disruption of tissues in lysis buffer yields DNA ideal forPCR, while disruption of tissues frozen in liquid nitrogen yields DNA of a highermolecular weight. We do not recommend disrupting frozen tissues in lysis bufferas this results in low yields and degraded DNA. Procedure 1. Place the tissues in 10 ml grinding jars containing 1 stainless steel grinding ball (20 mm mean diameter). 2. If purifying DNA of higher molecular weight from fresh or frozen tissues, freeze the jars in liquid nitrogen for 1 min. The grinding jars do not need to be frozen if disrupting fresh tissues in lysis buffer or if disrupting lyophilized tissues. 3. If necessary, add an appropriate volume of lysis buffer (e.g., Buffer AP1) to each jar. Lysis buffer must not be added if processing frozen grinding jar sets or if disrupting lyophilized tissues. 4. Operate the TissueLyser for 1 min at 30 Hz. 5. If purifying DNA of higher molecular weight from fresh or frozen tissues, freeze the jars in liquid nitrogen for 1 min. The grinding jars do not need to be frozen if disrupting fresh tissues in lysis buffer or if disrupting lyophilized tissues. Plant Tissues Maxi (DNA)6. Operate the TissueLyser for 1 min at 30 Hz. 7. Add lysis buffer (e.g., Buffer AP1) if necessary, and proceed with DNA purification. The stainless steel grinding balls can be reused.
