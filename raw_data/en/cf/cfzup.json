The majority of the building s were built for commercial use. Exceptions include a county courthouse, municipal buildings, a lodge hall, a library, and a church. In several instances , these non -commercial buildings are located on the edge s of the district and separate commercial areas from residential. New construction in the district is minima l, though a large apartment building was under construction on North Broadway in 2020. Among the distinctions of this compact district is that its bounda ry, more or less , constitute s the extent of commercial development and planning in Watertown by 1888. The size of the district reflects Watertown's rapid and substantial growth within ten year s of its establishment. The result is a district with well -defined edges. The district contains several \"main\" streets, especially Broadway, Kemp, and Maple. Whi le Broadway is the stem for the additional streets, all saw important and early commercial development. This led to a unified appearance throughout the district. The designs of Watertown architect Maurice A. Hockman also contribute to the homogeneity of the streetscape, especially his use of brow n-shaded bricks, brick dentils, Kasota stone trim, and classical motifs. Hockman's contributions coincide with the peak period of construction in the district that occurred from 1898 to 1915 . The most unifying a rchitectural feature of the district is its brick facades , generally in shades of brown. Using color s ranging from pink -tan to golden to very dark brown, almost half of the buildings exhibit some gradation of brown. Regardless of hue or configuration, br own brick facades are especially attractive when paired with contrasting stone trim. Kasota stone, with its rich pink cast, and the more somber Bedford limestone adorn a number of buildings . While the brown brick facades provide a measure of uniformity, a selection of other materials lend diversity to the district. These include terra cotta , Sioux Quartzite , and red brick . Other materials represented included stucco, painted brick, and marble trim . One example has roughly - cast concrete block s and an elaborate nineteenth -century metal facade (11 E Kemp, Mercer Block). Certain design motifs are repeated on the buildings . Classically -inspired designs dominate and reflect styles prominent during the city's turn -of-the-century building boom. Early twentieth - century geometric patterns, generally executed in brick, are also present, often in combination with classical motifs . Several buildings in the district are attributed to Hockman and many more carry Hockman attri butes. Hockman often used bricks to form a prominent course of dentils, a United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form NPS Form 10 -900 OMB Control No. 1024 -0018 Watertown Commercial Historic District Amendment 2020 (Boundary Decrease) Codingt on County, South Dakota Name of Property County and State Section 7 page 6 smooth stone molding near the top of the building, stone or brick outline s frame ing window groupings, outsized keystones, and Kasota stone with a rough finish for lintels, sills, and courses. Distinctive period designs reflect the late nineteenth -century beginnings of Watertown's commercial sector. The Mercer Block at 11 E Kemp , with its Corinthian colonettes, rosettes, and semi -circular arches, is the only remaining metal fa\u00e7ade in the district. The Brizee Block at 15 E Kemp features pressed brick in four patterns. Several other red brick examples have smooth stone lintels that are slightly pedimented or otherwise shaped. With t heir large size and corner locations, the Mellette Block at 1 -11 W Kemp and the Goss Opera House at 10 0 E Kemp are the most prominent examples. Like the multiplicity in materials represented in the district, cornice lines of the streetscapes are varied. Even adjacent buildings dating from the same year display slightly different heights. Most buildings in the district are two -story, though height varies. On e-, one -and-a-half, two-, two-and-a-half, three -, and four -story buildings are represented. Talle r buildings are , with one exception of new construction, found at the corners and do not impede the visual flow of the streetscape. The effect of varying height s is not discordant but provide s variation. Nearly all buildings present a smooth continuous f a\u00e7ade line, and the impression is one of commercial enterprise extending in several directions. The similar scale of buildings contributes to the district's unified appearance. Most first -floor storefronts have been altered. However, some degree of change is expected in a thriving commercial area. Post-World War II infill is generally small -scale, one -story buildings that do not distract from the setting, feel ing, and association of the district. Streets have diagonal parking and attracti ve, modern streetlights in a historical recreation. Sidewalks in front of buildings contain trees, flower planters, sculptures, and benches. Contributing buildings in the district are significant for architecture and commerce. Storefront alterations a re accepted as a natural maturity of the district and unless extremely distracting do not impact a building's integrity and ability to contribute . Many upper floors of contributing buildings in the district have replacement windows and/or wood infill. Th e loss of historic fenestration along with storefront alterations lessen s overall material integrity, but integrity of design, workmanship, location, setting, feeling, and association is strong with many buildings that retain decorative brick work, elabora te cornices, stone lintels and sills, and other ornamentation that add to the architectural cohesion of the district. Noncontributing buildings are generally alter ed one -story buildings and two - or three -story buildings of simple design with extensive mat erial alterations to storefronts and upper -floor windows.

The 2020 amendment retains that numbering system for future cross -reference purposes . The number is listed in parentheses after the address in Section 7. Additionally, well -recognized names associated with a building may be listed after the number. For buildings added to the district since 1989, numbers have been assigned. Building histories have been included below the architectural descriptions. It is organized in this manner to allow changes to be potentially tracked to a specific business, such as a postwar storefront modernization.

Its significance is local . Commerce The banks, professional offices, and retail stores in the district made Watertown the largest trade center in northeastern South Dakota. The commercial strength of the district fueled Watertown's population growth to over 10,000 in the 1930s and augmented residential expansion on the edges of the district. The buildings in the district represent Watertown's evolution from a prairie railroad stop to one of the largest cities in South Dakota. Architecture The district contains a homogenous collection of styled buildings dating primarily from the 1890s to the 1910s. Most buildings are one - and two -part commercial blocks of brown -shaded brick trimmed with Kasota stone quarried in Minnesota. A handful of landmark buildings in the district feature quartzite, Bedford limestone, and terra cotta. The Commerci al style is the dominant theme within the district. However, examples of Classical Revival, Neoclassical Revival, Renaissance Revival, Romanesque, Beaux Arts, Art Deco, and Streamline Moderne style s are found throughout the district . The execution of the se styles gives the district a unified and attractive appearance. The period of significance is 1882 to 193 9. This represents the development of the district from conception to maturity. A major period of construction occurred from 1898 to 1915, and the district was primarily infilled by 1923, but significant buildings in the district were built before and after this period. The POS begins in 1882 with the construction of the Granite Block and ends with the construction of the WPA -built city aud itorium in 193 9. In the original 1989 nomination the POS was 1882 -1936, with the end date based on the auditorium's construction. The auditorium was built in 1939, not 1936, and the POS has been extended accordingly. No new buildings were added to the d istrict until the early 1950s and mid -century storefront alterations have largely been modernized again , leaving no justification to extend the end date of the POS past 1939.

Note : Individual building histories are found in Section 7 below their architectural descriptions. Early History and Commerce of Watertown Peoples of the Oceti Sakowin (aka the Sioux) lived in the area that would become Watertown, South Dakota, prior to white settlement. The Oceti Sakowin was comprised of seven divisions who spoke three dialects - Dakota, Nakota, and Lakota. The four divisions who spoke the Dakota dialect - Mdewakantowan, Wahpekute, Sissetonwan, and Wahpetonwan - occupied the general area of western Minnesota and what wou ld become eastern Dakota Territory. The Dakota moved freely in these areas an d were far enough away from the encroaching white civilization in southeastern Minnesota that no drastic lifestyle changes occurred until the 1850s .55 This dynamic would change, though, and quickly uproot the cultural norms of the Dakota and other band s of the Oceti Sakowin . Settlers began encroaching upon the lands of the Mdewakantowan, Wahpekute, Sissetonwan, and Wahpetonwan , and conflict followed. After the United States/Da kota War of 1862 -65, the Dakota signed treaties with the U.S. government that created two reservations: Spirit Lake (present -day northeast North Dakota) and Lake Traverse (present -day northeast South Dakota). The cessation of conflict in eastern Dakota Te rritory increased immigration dramatically.56 Settlement began soon after the 1867 Treaty but was slow due to a lack of railroads . The Panic of 1873 caused railroad expansion across Minnesota and Iowa to stop short of Dakota Terri tory, but soon there after railroad construction restarted and settlers began pouring into eastern Dakota Territory.57 In 1873, the Winona & St. Peter Rai lroad (a subsidiary of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway) established a depot stop at Lake Kampeska, several miles west of present -day Watertown. When the railroad realized their federal land grant did not extend to Lake Kampeska, they relocated their depot approximately six miles to the east .58 In August of the 1878, a new town was platted and named Watertown because several men involved in the early townsite were from Watertown, New Yor k.59 Productive agricultural land and ample water in the form of glacial lakes surrounded Watertown and boosted its prosperity . Awarded the county seat in 1878, Watertown became an important 55 Elijah Black Thunder, et al., Ehanna Woyakapi: History and Culture of the Sisseton -Wahpeton of South Dakota , (Sisseton, SD: Sisseton -Wahpteton Sioux Jacon, Homesteading and Agricultural Development (Vermillion, SD: South Dakota State Historical Pres ervation Center, 1994) 9. 57 Ibid, 285. 58 Watertown Commercial Historic District National Register Nomination (NRIS#89000834), 8 -2. 59 Donald Dean Parker.

By 1881, its population reached 2,000.60 In the 1880s, significant development occurred in the commercial district. This coincided with the Great Dak ota Boom, a period of immense immigration into eastern Dakota Territory occurring from 1878 -1887. By 1886, two additional rail lines had arrived in the city and the population had doubled to 4,186. The city also added four new business blocks to the commercial district and around 200 houses in the town. By 1888, Sanborn Fire Insurance maps detail commercial development on all streets present in the Watertown Commercial Historic District. Many buildings were wood frame with traditional boomtown false fronts, but a number of significant brick and stone buildings were also present including the Brizee Block (#50) on East Kemp .61 Around 1888, two of the city's most important buildings, the Mellette Block (#8) and the Granite Block (#65), were built. Their construction at Broadway and Kemp established that intersection as the financial sector of early Watertown and aided in the development along and beyond the traditional \"main street\" development emanating south from the railroad tracks. The construc tion of the large brick and stone buildings also signified the optimism and confidence characteristic of Watertown in the early 1880s.62 Winona and St. Peter Railroad officials platted the original town of Watertown. Narrow lots intended for commercial d evelopment along 1st Avenue North ran parallel to the railroad tracks. Five hotels and one boarding house were soon located along this trackside avenue, and 1st Avenue North continued to house hotels into the early twentieth century. Along the tracks on the north side of 1st Avenue was the warehouse district, a clear dividing line for the predominately retail commercial district to the south. In 1888, the warehouse area included trackage and depots for two rail lines, cattle pens, grain and coal storage, beer vaults, and lu mber yards.63 When South Dakota became a state in 1889, Watertown competed to become the state capital but finished in third place behind Huron and Pierre. By 1890, substantial commercial enterprises were firmly entrenched along three blocks of 1st Avenue North, a half block on Kemp from Broadway, and for a full one -and-three -quarter blocks down Broadway towards the courthouse. The 1890s, however, marked the end of the heady developmental period for Watertown. Crop failures and a nationwide financial depression slowed expansion. These problems were somewhat mitigated in northeastern South Dakota when the federal government opened more lands to settlement on the Lake Traverse Indian Reservation. Under the Dawes Severalty Act , one million acres in neighboring Roberts County was removed from the reservation in 1889 and opened to settlement. The act also opened an additional 50,000 acres in Codington County. On the first day the land was available, 1,500 land seekers showed up at the United States Land 60 Watertown Commercial Historic District National Register Nomination (NRIS#89000834), 8 -2. 61 Ibid, 8 -2. 62 Ibid, 8 -2 & 8 -3. 63 Ibid, 8 -3.

The arrival of new settlers bolstered the local economy and encouraged construction along Kemp Avenue. Anchoring Kemp's west end, at 1st Street West, a new City Hall (not extant) was built. Two blocks away, at East Kemp and Maple, the Goss Opera House was constructed.64 At the turn of the century, Watertown's population was just over 3,300. A scant four years later in 1904, the populati on shot up over 5,000. Watertown emerged as the fourth -largest city in the state. Progressive -minded residents sought and gained a Carnegie grant for a new library in 1906 (#111). Additionally, a new post office building was constructed in 1909 (#37) an d two hospitals in 1910. New commercial undertakings were also flourishing in the first decade of the twentieth century. In 1906, businessmen founded the Dakota Mutual Life Insurance Company (renamed the Midland National Life Insurance Company in 1925) i n the Granite Block. By 1910, large new warehouses replaced original ones north of 1st Avenue North. New hotels, including the Peacock (#81), supplemented or replaced those from the 1880s. Broadway saw considerable infill and commercial use now extended for two full blocks.65 Around 1915, commercial development entered its mature phase. The massive Lincoln Hotel (not extant) was in place at Maple in the hotel sector along 1st Avenue North. Also buil t between 1910 and 1915 were Schaller's store (#94), the Dakota Central Telephone Company Building (#110), and the Citizen's National Bank (#47). Businessmen apparently felt that a location in the increasingly built -up commercial district was so critical that they even built in Midway Alley (#98-#101) betw een Broadway and Maple.66 The period from 1898 to 1915 saw substantial construction in the district and infill was essentially complete by 1923. New churches, the Church of the Immaculate Conception (not extant) in 1906 and F irst Congregational Church (# 114), were built at the edges of the commercial sector. The construction of a new and thoroughly modern county courthouse in 1928 capped the maturation of Watertown's commercial district.67 The depressed farm economy after World War I impacted Watertown's economy in the 1920s. Like most communities in South Dakota, the Great Depression in the 1930s further stilled economic growth. Banks closed or merged and new construction stopped with the exception of construction through government programs. The Works Progress Administration built the city auditorium (#24) and the addition to the post office (#37) during the 1930s. Watertown's position as a regional hub helped it weather the depression better than mo st communities. It remained a railroad center, which meant it also acted as a wholesaler center, which kept the local economy afloat. It also remained a retail center for area farmers and continued a relatively strong trade in farm machinery. By 1940, W atertown's population held steady around 10,000 and by the 1950s the economy supported 250 retail establishment and 50 wholesale outlets.

The Chicago school or Commercial Style (c. 1880s -1930) developed through the influence of engineer William L. Jenney and architectural firms like Burnham & Root, Holabird & Roche, and Adler & Sullivan.69 The social context of expanding industrial capitalism prioritized the function of the buildings including their durability, lighting, and space \u2014requiring art to submit to the function of commerce and leading to the name Commercial Style.70 Fenestration is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the Commercial Style and uses regular patterns with large, divided, rectangular windows. Commercial Style architects often further recessed the windows to form pilaster -like columns along the walls that s imultaneously reinforced strong verticality. Smaller -scale buildings area commonly masonry or have masonry cladding, limited decoration on the main walls, and styled detailings. The majority of the buildings in the Watertown Commercial Historic District can be attributed to the general Commercial Style, though some include Classical, Renaissance Revival, and Richardsonian Romanesque motif and characteristics. Building are executed in one - and two -part commercial blocks. One and Two -part Commercial blo cks Commercial architecture styles in large cities have received more attention than modestly -scaled work done in small - to moderate -sized towns. Nonetheless, commercial main streets from the mid-nineteenth century to the mid -twentieth century were signi ficant economic, social, and cultural places. Design of the commercial blocks built during this time period emphasized their street fa\u00e7ades. In a national scope, downtown buildings exhibit more similarities than differences.71 Storeowners' goals to comm unicate prosperity and stability were often the same across the country, and ethnic distinctions were more often suppressed than embraced. In terms of the actual construction, \"itinerant builders and architects contributed to this homogeneity before manufa cturers' catalogs and trade and professional journals helped to codify it.\"72 68 Ibid, 8 -5. 69 Carl W.

The two-part commercial blocks include buildings two to four stor ies high divided horizontally into a lower retail space (the storefront) and an upper private space. On taller buildings, the lower zone often extended to the first two stories. One-part commercial blocks are only one -story high and the composition of th e building was restricted to the storefront and cornice. Such buildings were more frequently built in new communities or in outlying areas of established communities \"as an expedient solution to strong pressure for commercial development.\"74 False -front fa\u00e7ades similarly tried to convey successful commerce for the early phases of the downtown's development or for corner stores in residential neighborhoods.75 Larger -scale buildings were constructed downtown when resources were available. Temp le-front and vault buildings used Classical Revival elements to communicate traditionalism and stability, particularly for financial institutions and public buildings. Non -retail commercial buildings \u2014banks, offices, hotels, theatres \u2014often had a more inte grated fa\u00e7ade design, but they did occasionally host retail space on their first floors as well.76 Regardless of function, traditional design principles on a streetscape attempted to make commercial buildings into \"dignified contributors to a coherent urban landscape.\"77 Colonial Revival , Neoclassicism , Beaux Arts , Italian Renaissance Classically inspired architecture continued to be a popular style for buildings in the early - twentieth century. Classical aesthetics represented stability, eternality, hig h culture, and affluence. Colonial Revival buildings recreated classical buildings and formal design principles. Colonial Revival -inspired buildings in the district include First Congregational Church and its manse. Classical elements are also found on brick commercial buildings across the distric t including brick dentils, consoles, pilasters, and quoins. Buildings associated with architect Maurice A. Hockman are noted for using reserved Classical motifs. Neoclassicism appeared as an architectural trend in waves from 1900 to 1920, and 1925 to 1950.78 Neoclassical buildings took a more flexible interpretation than nineteenth -century Colonial Revival architecture and played on variations for door and window surrounds, window shapes and fenestration, cornices, and porticos.79 Examples of Neoclassical buildings in the 73 Ibid, 20. 74 Ibid., 20. 75 Ibid., 21. 76 Richard Longstreth, The Buildings of Main Street: A Guide to American Commercial Architecture , Updated Edition (Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press, 2000), 31. 77 Ibid, 39. 78 Stephen Rogers and Lynda B.

The Beaux Arts movement, taught through L'\u00c9cole des Beaux Arts in Paris in the late 1880s and publicized through the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition, sought to revive classicism while trending towards \"ceremonial grandeur, monumentality, and formal discipline of the classical orders.\"80 Elements of Beaux Arts buildings include \"exuberant surface ornamentation\" that features heavy masonry enframement, decorative garlands or floral patterns, quoins, pilasters, columns, balustrades, masonry walls, and a rusticated first story.81 Beaux Arts aesthetics communicated conspicuous wealth and traditional high culture, and were more commonly found on landmark, architect -designed building s - such as major public buildings or the homes of industrial magnates. The style was most popular before 1915 but persisted to 1930. As an architectural style, it competed with the American modernist styles being done by Prairie School architects and others. Modernist critics called Bea ux Arts \"snobbish pretention, midwestern cultural insecurity, and the reduction of architects to retailers of imported styles.\"82 Some historians proposed sociological reasons for the popularity of Beaux Arts and included the need for \"new money\" capitali sts to confirm their elite status through European traditionalism or their need to impose order on the changing urban environments of the Progressive Era.83 An example of the Beaux Arts style in the district is the United States Post Office . Art Deco and Streamline Moderne During the 1920s and early 1930s, the Art Deco style exploded in popularity and lingered through the 1940s. Art Deco was \"mediational\" and sought to bridge traditional or ancient forms and symbolism with futuristic style and imagery .84 In 1922, Eliel Saarinen's second -place Art Deco entry for a Chicago design contest was highly publicized throughout the American architectural profession.85 Art Deco took its name from the Exposition internationale des Arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels modernes, held in Paris in 1925 to showcase works of \"new inspiration and real originality.\" The Art Deco style emphasized themes of the machine age using the forms of the past, and so did not break off completely from historical influences.86 Evolved fr om many sources, the building forms were often traditional, but the streamlining of the style recalled modernity and the machine age, while the zigzags, chevrons, and other patterns and icons were taken from the Far East, ancient Greece and Rome, Africa, I ndia, and the Mayan and Aztec cultures. 80 David Brain, \"Discipline & Style: The Ecole des Beaux -Arts and the Social Production of an American Architecture,\" Theory and Society 18(6) (November 198 9), 807. 81 Rogers and Schwan, 10; McAlester, 379. 82 Brain, 809 84 Richard Striner, \"Art Deco: Polemics and Synthesis., Winterthur Portfolio 25(1) (Spring 1990), 22 -24. 85 McAlester, 465. 86 John C.

Buildings had a heavy vertical emphasis created with fa\u00e7ade forms that often used a series of setbacks and columns of windows. Ornamentation varied from using rich metals or colored tiles, to being very subtle and of the same material as the buildings. Concrete, smooth faced stone and metal characterized the exterior of many Art Deco style buildings. Many buildings of this style are decorated with stylized terra cotta motifs and cast aluminum features.87 An example of Art Deco in the district is the WPA -constructed City Auditorium . A related trend, Streamline Moderne , also used smooth surfaces and metals and was inspired by modernist thinking in the 1930s, but is distinguished by rounded features and a horizontal emphasis. In the district , some modernized storefronts feature sign f ronts and rounded windows and canopies that refl ect Streamline Moderne design . Examples include storefronts at 214 -218 East Kemp and 10 E Kemp. Richardsonian Romanesque The Richardsonian Romanesque style is characterized by asymmetry, wide and round arches that sometimes use massive piers over windows and entrances, corner towers, and masonry walls that were often rough -faced.88 In southeastern South Dakota, architects a nd builders frequently used locally -quarried Sioux quartzite for styles like Romanesque. Because it was such an expensive style, Romanesque was primarily used for landmark buildings, mostly commercial or institutional. In the Northeast, H.H. Richardson developed a characteristic American expression of the Romanesque Revival and used influences from many different European traditions. His Trinity Church in Boston was widely known by architects even before it was finished , and \"in 1886 the American Architect and Building News polled seventy -five American architects to determine the ten most admired buildings in the United States. Buildings by Richardson filled five of the ten places.\"89 Although he died in 1886, the styl e was revived through an 1888 monograph on Richardson's life and became widely popular in the 1890s.90 Many warehouses built in the late nineteenth century were Romanesque Revival in style and may have been influenced by the famous Marshall -Field wholesal e store designed by Richardson in Chicago in 1885 -1886. Warehouses tended to use conservative and formal building styles to convey a sense of stability, strength, and reliability to customers. Nationwide, companies often featured their wholesaling buildi ngs in advertising and catalogs. An example of the style in the district is the Granite Block . Maurice A.

Hockman is credited with designing fourteen buildings in the district and is suspected to have been the architect for several more. Of the fourteen Hockman - designed buildings, three have been demolished since the original 1989 National Register nomination. Hockman was very active in Watertown and northeastern South Dakota in the early twentieth century. Hockman designed multiple building types including churches, libraries, hospitals, warehouses, banks, apartment buildings, houses, and mausoleums. Hockman was born in Frankfort, Indiana, in 187 8. He enrolled at Purdue University in 1888 - 1889 and also work ed through the International Correspondence Schools. He moved to Watertown in 1902 and established a solo practice. He later partnered for a time with Fred Schweiger. Hockman was not only an architect, but also served as a bridge engineer for Codington County and as a consulting engineer on plumbing and heating projects. In 1905 -07, he served as a military advisor to Governor Samuel H. Elrod and was commission ed a captain in the South Dakota National Guard in 1910. He entered regular Army service in 1917 during World War I serving stateside as a construction quartermaster for hospitals, barracks, and other Army projects.91 After the war, Hockman remained in the military retiring in 1931. He died in Indiana in 1951.92 Hockman -designed buildings Citizens National Bank #56 Balsiger's Bakery #72 Goss Opera House Annex #80 Smith, Schulner, & Lion Business Block #94 Schallers #111 Carnegie Free Library #113 Watertown Congregational Church Conclusion The Watertown Commercial Historic District has one of the best collections of styled buildings in a commercial setting in the state. The architectural integrity of the district allows it to convey a turn -of-the-century feel and express the commercial development of Watertown.
