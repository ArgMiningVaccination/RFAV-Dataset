It supports natural toxin removal as its natural qualities allow the supplement to penetrate deep into the tissues and organs.

The Dandelions are known for encouraging natural detoxification inside the liver. They also support the natural cleansing of blood and skin. At Athreya, we only select green Dandelions with more soothing properties. Other ingredients in the herbal blend include Kelp. It serves as a natural source of collagen for gut health and promotes GI absorption too. Then there is the Psyllium Husk and Senna. Their combined presence supports natural toxin removal. In contrast, the Papaya Leaf and Plantain Leaf boost gut health with their natural enzymatic action. Our blend also contains other greens for complete gut rejuvenation. Lastly, we included Moringa, an Ayurvedic herb for the healthy elimination of deep-seated toxins. It contains ingredients sourced and processed under the best conditions and formulated according to Ayurvedic traditions for a potent and effective supplement.
