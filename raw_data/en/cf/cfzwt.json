We are forming an alliance in order to bring awareness to the public, to business, and to the government about the power of integrative medicine. Mission: to make healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle the norm and not the exception. Health is about spirit/body/mind and in order to address these things, clinicians need more time with patients. Our health care system needs a structural change and we feel this can be done though disease prevention rather than disease management. "}
