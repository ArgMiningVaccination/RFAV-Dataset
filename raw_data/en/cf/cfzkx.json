Working with her in my early months of recovery, she was exactly who I needed in order to trust that a practitioner was actually on my side and I could be completely honest about my addiction history and subsequent mental and physical health struggles.

This approach to health care recognizes that hormone imbalances, gut health, and autoimmune disorders are often interconnected and require a comprehensive approach to treatment. Integrative medicine practitioners use a variety of techniques to support their patients' health and wellness, including nutrition and lifestyle counseling, mind-body medicine, and herbal medicine. Environmental medicine is also an important component of integrative medicine, as it recognizes the impact of toxins and environmental factors on health and wellbeing. One of the key benefits of integrative medicine is its focus on preventative care. By identifying and addressing potential health issues before they become serious, integrative medicine practitioners can help their patients achieve optimal health and wellness. Complementary medicine techniques, such as acupuncture, massage therapy, and yoga, can also play a valuable role in supporting overall health and wellbeing. If you're interested in exploring integrative medicine and holistic health, it's important to find a practitioner who is experienced and knowledgeable in this area. Look for a naturopathic doctor or integrative medicine practitioner who specializes in chronic disease management and is trained in functional nutrition, hormone imbalances, and gut health.
