Moisturizing regularly, taking lukewarm showers, and speaking with a doctor about treatment can help to manage psoriasis that worsens in winter. Colder weather [may trigger](https://www.psoriasis.org/causes/) psoriasis flares due to lower sunlight and humidity levels, illness, and increased stress. A [2021 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8121268/) However, there are several steps people can take to manage psoriasis symptoms and reduce flare-up severity if their condition typically worsens during colder weather. This article discusses tips for managing psoriasis in the cold and when to contact a doctor. Stress is a [major trigger](https://www.psoriasis.org/causes/) for psoriasis flares. Some people may feel more stressed around the holidays, which could worsen psoriasis symptoms. According to the [National Alliance on Mental Illness](https://namica.org/blog/handling-stress-during-the-holiday-season/), techniques to manage stress during the holidays include: - set boundaries - practice [meditation and mindfulness](/articles/324839) - spend time outside - take breaks from stressful situations, such as during family gatherings - attend [therapy sessions](/articles/talk-therapy) Learn more about [stress and psoriasis](/articles/psoriasis-stress).

Regular moisturizing can help seal skin moisture during drier conditions, such as in winter. Moisturizing may also help to reduce psoriasis symptoms, including lesions and itching. Learn more about [lotions, ointments, and creams for psoriasis](/articles/319693). People may have less exposure to natural sunlight during the winter months, which may lessen UVB exposure. UVB occurs in sunlight and [may help](https://www.psoriasis.org/phototherapy/) slow down skin cell growth to treat psoriasis. Phototherapy targets psoriasis with artificial UVB light. People may have regular treatments, either at a doctor's office or using a phototherapy unit at home. Learn about [light therapy for psoriasis](/articles/323593). Bathing may irritate and dry out psoriasis further, so the [AAD](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/psoriasis/skin-care/baths-showers) recommends that people with psoriasis take short, lukewarm showers or baths and limit them to once a day. Using a fragrance-free, moisturizing cleanser and avoiding harsh scrubs or washcloths can help. After bathing, gently dab the skin dry and apply moisturizer onto slightly damp skin.

Using a humidifier may help to manage psoriasis flares. If the air inside a room feels dry, people can plug in a [humidifier](/articles/322228) to add more moisture to the air. Learn about the [differences between a humidifier and a vaporizer](/articles/327156).
