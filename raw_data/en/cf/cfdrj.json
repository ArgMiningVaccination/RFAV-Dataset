We love our trusty South Korean and Japanese beauty brands, but China offers up some choice buys as well, but is often over-looked. This is unfortunate, given that Chinese medicine has devoted thousands of years to finding solutions to a plethora of skin- and body-care woes.

This \"chi\" energy travels through the meridian system, which is described as an energy highway that runs throughout the body. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) uses procedures like acupuncture, herbal therapy, and massage to stimulate this system. \"It's all about the balance of yin and yang,\" adds Wei Young Brian, founder of [Wei Beauty](https://www.weibeauty.com/), a skin-care line formulated with Chinese medicine in mind. Brian uses Chinese herbs like bitter melon and China rose to bring off-kilter skin to balance. \"I believe that there can be blockages in the microchannels under the skin,\" Brian says. \"We use deep-cleaning and purifying products to increase circulation, so that these blockages can move.\" [Related: 6 Ways To Keep Oily Skin At Bay](http://www.refinery29.com/oily-skin-summer-help?utm_source=yahoobeauty&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=related) So, in honor of this year's Met Gala theme \u2014 \"China: Through the Looking Glass\" \u2014 we've rounded up a few of our own favorites. While not all of the effects of TCM are backed by conclusive evidence, we can attest that these Chinese beauty brands' formulations really work. Here at Refinery, we love [double-masking](http://www.refinery29.com/double-face-masks?utm_source=yahoobeauty&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=main) to keep our skin balanced and pampered. By separating the black purifying mask (step one) and the white nourishing mask (step two) into fool-proof sections, this skin savior does all the thinking for you \u2014 in true yin and yang fashion.

This no-fuss balm has been a fan favorite since its creation in the 1870s, and for good reason: You can use it to relieve almost anything, from muscle tension and headaches to stuffy noses and even bruises. Simply warm the product up in your hands before applying, and you'll instantly be witness to the pain-relieving qualities.

Watermelon Frost has inflammation-calming properties, making it a great spot treatment for any skin issues you may be experiencing. It's most traditionally used for oral care (it works wonders on canker and cold sores), but we like applying it on zits to decrease swelling, too.
