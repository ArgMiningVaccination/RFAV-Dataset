We have developed an EMCCD interface that incorporates a deep neural network (DNN) to achieve higher accuracy than conventio nal thresholding techniques. It is implemented in a field - programmable gate array (FPGA) to accelerate the DNN and achieve low latency.

Since artificial intelligence (AI) is the defining technology of our time, it is natural to ask what role it could play for 6G. The goal o f the project is to demonstrate a 6G vision of a new air interface and end -to-end learning PHY, which is partially designed by AI to enable optimised end -to-end communication schemes for any hardware, radio environment, and application.

Knowledge of hardware design beneficial Project Description: The use of machine learning (ML) across an increasing number of application domains continues to grow. Similarly, we are seeing an increasing number of digital devices throughout society. Embedded devices nowadays have substantial processing capability - but not sufficient to handle the latest ML algorithms. Instead, simplified networks are often deployed on these devices, but these typically come with reduced accuracy. In this project, you will explore how to combine input from multiple embedded devices with independent sensors to produce a more accurate output. Since the embedded devices will have different sensors or different viewpoints, they should be able to outperf orm any single device. The ML algorithms you create will perform some local processing before sharing this with other devices to make final decisions. This means the algorithms must be simple enough to be implemented on embedded hardware, and as such, som e hardware design experience is desirable.

EIE2023 -24/11 Fragility in topological nanophotonic structures Supervisor: Dr. Alex Song Eligibility : - WAM>75 - Undergraduate candidates must have already completed at least 96 credit points towards their undergraduate degree at the time of application. - Basic knowledge of electromagnetics and solid -state physics Project Description: The 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics has further invigorated the enthusiasm for topological phases of matter over the past two decades. In the field of nanophononics, the emergence of non - trivial topology holds great promise for the development of robust photonic devices, including large lasers, quantum emitters, and quantum interconn ects. However, recent studies have yielded surprising results: in photonic structures, non -trivial topological indices like Chern numbers and Z2 may not confer the anticipated robustness against deformations and defects. Although this fragility might be in terpreted as symmetry breaking in certain scenarios, a comprehensive investigation and categorization of disorder are currently lacking. Considering this, our objective is to conduct a systematic study of various types of disorder in topological photonic s tructures to comprehend the reasons behind their evasion of topological protection. Through these studies, we aim to propose genuinely fault -tolerant structures suitable for real - world applications. Requirement to be on campus: Yes * dependent on governmen t's health advice. EIE2023 -24/12 A Digital Twin System for Autonomous Driving and Smart Manufacturing Supervisor: Dr Dong Yuan Eligibility: Good programming skill. Familiar with UE5 and C++ are preferrable. Project Description: Wireless technology as the backbone of mobile applications has become essential in our daily lives. However, signal fluctuations caused by the unpredictable nature of factors such as moving crowds and improvised events in wireless and mobile applications amplify th e complexity of their comprehensive evaluation across diverse real -world environments. To address these challenges, we developed a digital twin system with learning -based calibration and ray -tracing based real -time wireless propagation simulation capabilit ies for WMAs. The system can learn the latent state of the environment from real data for high -precision calibration and accurately simulate wireless systems in realistic 3D environment.

Requirement to be on campus: No 19 EIE2023 -24/13 Efficient Deep Learning Inference with Edge Computing Supervisor : Dr. Dong Yuan Eligibility: WAM>75 and Familiar with PyTorch; programming with Python and C++ Project Description: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially improve the accuracy and speed of video analytics. The maturity of cloud computing, equipped with powerful hardware like GPU, becomes a typical choice for such kind of computation intensive DNN tasks. One obstacle, however, is the large amount of data volume of video streams. For example, a self - driving car can generate up to 750 megabytes of sensed data per second, but the average uplink rate of 4G, fastest existing solution, is only 5.85 Mb ps. To avoid the effects of network delay and put the computing at the proximity of data sources, edge computing emerges. Nevertheless, edge computer itself is limited by its computing capacity and energy constraints, which cannot fully replace cloud compu ting. This project will investigate the efficient parallel algorithms for DNN inference tasks on the edge server that equipped with GPUs.

Project Description: Recent research showed that signal jitte r can be used to deduce secret keys from Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) circuits. AES algorithm is widely used to encrypt data and credit/debit cards. In this project, we aim to detect signal jitter and identify when power consumption information is presented in signal jitter. We will also test whether filtering jitter can be used as a countermeasure to prevent such attacks. How do we do it ? - We will implement an experimental setup on an FPGA board and perform a jitter -based power anal ysis attacks (we have most of the source code). Using an oscilloscope, we will analyse signal jitter when the signal has random jitter vs. when it contains power side - channel information. Finally, we will investigate filtering jitter from the signal as a p ossible countermeasure and test the efficacy of mitigating such attacks. Requirement to be on campus: Yes * dependent on government's health advice. EIE2023 -24/15 Covert Data Channels using Signal Prof. Sri Project Description: Recent research [1] showed signal jitter can reveal power consumption side -channel information. When circuits are operated on FPGAs, the signal jitter is induced due to the power consumption of other circuits running parallel. In this project, we aim to d eploy the FPGA signal jitter to transmit and receive secret data (covert data). Covert channels use different properties such as message delays, temperature differences and operating frequencies to transmit data secretly between isolated entities. Such covert data transmission channels create security vulnerabilities in cloud FPGA services, such as Amazon EC2 F1. How We do it? - We will develop an FPGA hardware program to generate and measure signal jitter to create a novel covert data system and evaluat e data transmit rates. Then, we will integrate the developed covert data transmission system into an HDMI controller to demonstrate a practical security vulnerability. 20 https://tc hes.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/10965/10272 Requirement to be on campus: Yes * dependent on government's health advice. EIE2023 -24/16 Testing on AI -based systems Supervisor s: Dr. Huaming Chen Eligibility: WAM>75 and Undergraduate candidates must have already completed at least 96 credit points towards their undergraduate degree at the time of application. Project Description: Deep learning (DL) has become a new paradigm for solving many real -world problems due to its astonishing performance in different domains such as image analysis, natural language processing and system security. However, DL has also shown latent vulnerabilities leading to different kinds of \"errors\" which makes it challengi ng to develop robust DL software. Sometimes, it may involve the hardware -software codesign issue. Therefore, to improve the reliability of DL software, it is crucial to have a systematic understanding and exploration for the techniques of automatically te sting the robustness of trained DL software. In this project, we will work on the topic to test the trained DL software against various errors and ensure that it meets the required quality standards.

Project Description: Exploiting WiFi signals for indoor localization has been an active topic due to the wide deployment of WiFi infrastructure. However, existing ranging -based methods can achieve meter -level accuracy with strong line -of-sight (LoS) paths. In the scenarios without LoS path, the wireless signals suffer from deep fading, multi -path effects, and packet losses, and thus resulting in low localiz ation accuracy. This project aims to develop a high -accuracy indoor localization system based on existing Wi - Fi infrastructure and mobile devices.

Polar codes have been ado pted in the 5G standard. Beyond 5G and 6G systems need a highly adaptive polar coding scheme that closely adapts to various channel conditions and satisfies KPI requirements such as reliability, throughput, and latency. A flexible channel code structure wi th high error correction capability is needed to achieve high reliability in multi -user interference scenarios. Adaptivity means the opportunity to produce codes with diverse characteristics and select a proper code for given requirements on the FER perfor mance, decoding latency, and computational complexity. To accurately predict the FER performance of polar codes, this project will build a framework that integrates the coding theory and machine learning. This framework will be based on a neural network th at receives essential code features as input.

Project Description : The use of intranasal drug delivery as a means of effective self -vaccination has a lot of interest, but so many questions remain with regards to how aerosol is transported thro ugh the human nasal channels and what the mechanisms of drug transport are once the drug has made contact with human tissue. Similar questions persist in our understanding of more traditional inhaler devices. These inhalers are not only used for treatment of common respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD, but also for delivery of inhaled antibiotics. At the core of controlling the efficacy of these delivery systems, is a need to understand the turbulent fluid mechanics of droplets in complex geometries .

Despite how critical understanding these flows is to our everyday lives, from food production to pollutant control and pharmaceuticals, the physics of these fl ows remains poorly understood. This results in high inefficiency and waste in a range of industrial systems because our ability to physically model the underlying mechanisms is too rudimentary.

MECH 2023 -24/3 Developing aluminium superalloys through nanoscale phase engineering by metal 3D printing Supervisor s: Prof. Simon Ringer & Dr. Suqin Zhu Eligibility: WAM>75 and Undergraduate candidates must have already completed at least 96 credit points towards their undergraduate degree at the time of application. Project Description: Heat-resistant metallic alloys, or superalloys, are essential for our industries and everyday life. They must meet high -performance requirements for working at elevated temperatures, limiting the material options to Ni, Co, Fe or Ti -based alloys which are either expensive or heavy. To meet modern industry's emission -reduction and sustainability requirements, it is necessary to develop lightweight and cost -effective heat -resistant alloys that complement the current alloy systems. Aluminium (Al) is the second most used metal, lightweight and infinitely recyclable. However, Al alloys have relatively poor heat resistance and are typically used below 150 \u00b0C. Additive manuf acturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, has emerged as a disruptive technology in the last decade to produce geometrically complex and lighter metallic products with exceptional microstructure and properties. This pro ject will explore the feasibility of developing Al -based superalloys using AM via phase transformations that create nanoscale heterogeneity to achieve heat resistance at 200 -400 \u00b0C.

MECH 2023 -24/6 Legoing atoms on supercomputers: point defects and impurities in advanced alloys Supervisor s: Prof. Simon Ringer; Dr Carl Cui Eligibility: WAM>75 and Undergraduate candidates must have already completed at least 96 credit points towards their undergraduate degre e at the time of application Project Description: Computational simulation is a valuable approach often likened to \"theoretical experiments on (super)computers\". It is one of the few enabling methodologies that can significantly reduce development cycle times and costs in the material sciences. With continuous advancements in algorithms and computational power, this methodology has played a pivotal role in expediting the design, processing and performance optimisation of technologically important materials and devices. In the realm of alloy mechanics, it has long been known that point defects and impurities play a crucial role in affecting mechanical properties - some are vital, and some are fatal. However, much of the current understanding relies on semi -empirical rules, limiting direct applicability to new alloy designs. By performing accurate first principles (without experimental or empirical parameters) atomistic simulation based on density functional theory, this project aims to delve into the fundamental behaviour (including the distribution, interaction, and diffusion) of defects and impurities in various technologically important alloys, such as titanium and ni ckel. The successful applicant will have access to powerful national computational facilitates, enabling robust and comprehensive simulations. The outcome of this project will provide valuable insights that can inform knowledge -based, rational design for advanced alloys, contributing to the advancement of materials science. Requirement to be on campus: No MECH 2023 -24/7 Mining rare -earth elements at the atomic level Supervisors: Prof. Simon Ringer; Dr Carl Cui Eligibility: WAM>75 and Undergraduate candidates must have already completed at least 96 credit points towards their undergraduate degree at the time of application . Project Description: Computational simulation has emerged as a pivotal tool, expediting the design, processing and performance optimisation of materials and devices, making it increasingly vital in contemporary research. Of particular interest are the rare -earth (RE) elements and their alloys, renowned for their peculiar properties, which hold significant promise for applications in high -tech industries and diverse manufactured products. In steel alloys, RE elements play a crucial role by eliminating impurities (such as oxygen and sulphur) and forming alloy solutions with iron. However, the underlying microscopic mechanism governing these processes remains inadequately understood. Based on the predictive first principle (no experimental or empirical parameter) 24 density functional theory, this computational project seeks to unravel two fundamental aspects: (1) the behaviour of RE elements in iron, and (2) the interaction between RE elements and different impurities (including boron, phosphine and sulphur) in the iron (both bcc and fcc) matrix. The successful applicant will have access to state -of-the-art national computational facilitates. This project offers a great opportunity to gain fundamental knowledge of materials engin eering, particularly in the emerging domain of next -generation steel research. The insights garnered from this endeavour will contribute valuable information for the advancement of next -generation steel, opening new frontiers for exploration in materials science. Requirement to be on campus: No MECH 2023 /8 Additive manufacturing and mechanical behaviour of high -performance multiple -principal element alloys Supervisor: Dr. Xianghai An Eligibility: High achievement in a relevant undergraduate engineering degree (a WAM of 75 or above). This summer project has the option to be combined with an honours project. Project Description: Over millennia, the basic alloying strategy of adding small amounts of secondary atoms into a primary element has re mained unchanged, limiting the total number of alloys and thus the reachable properties. The recently developed multiple -principal element alloys (MPE) alloys, can essentially address this shortfall, presenting a multitude of new opportunities for material s properties due to the vast compositional space previously inaccessible. It has been revealed that the exceptional properties and functionalities of MPE alloys originate from their compositional heterogeneities at the atomic level. In this project, we wil l apply the advanced manufacturing methods to enable the nanostructure engineering of MPE alloys, aiming to intelligently integrate multilevel chemical and structural heterogeneities, from sub -nanoscale and up, into the MPE alloys towards the superior comb inations of properties that are beyond current benchmark ranges . By delicately tailoring the parameters, the local chemical composition and nanostructures can be regulated to enable the rapid construction of complex heterogeneities from the bottom -up manne r. This project will open a new avenue for engineer the multiscale microstructure/chemical heterogeneities to design next -generation, high -performance, and sustainable alloys.

MECH 2023 -24/9 Making Strong Alloy s Ductile and Hydrogen -Tolerant through Engineering hierarchical heterogeneous Nanostructures Supervisor: Dr. Xianghai An Eligibility: High achievement in a relevant undergraduate engineering degree (a WAM of 75 or above). This summer project has the option to be combined with an honours project. Project Description: High-performance alloys are the backbone of decarbonising innovations in manufacturing, infrastructure , energy, and transportation. There is an accelerated demand for high-strength materials to produce lighter, more -reliable structural components. Stronger alloys will substantially improve mechanical and energy efficiencies, which can benefit our economy a nd environment directly. However, high -strength materials typically have low ductility and are more vulnerable to fracture. Furthermore, they are also susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in many service environments for renewable energy applications such as hydrogen transportation and the bearing s of wind turbines. Hydrogen -induced embrittlement can lead to unpredictable and catastrophic failures at relatively low applied stresses . These critical 25 shortcomings cause serious safety concerns but cannot be readily addressed by traditional materials development approaches that generally render materials property trade -offs between strength and ductility/HE resistance. Gradient structures are an emerging material -design paradigm inspired by nature that has great potential to overcome these alloy design trade -offs. This project aims to develop an innovative design strategy of gradient segregation engineering (GSE) to produce high - performance alloys by synergistically introducing a chemical gradient via grain boundary (GB) segregation and a physical gradient by nanostructure control. The novel GSE will entail a synergy of multiscale strengthening mechanisms that offer an exceptional strength -ductility combination and simultaneously enable the hierarchical HE -resisting mechanism s to notably enhance the hydrogen tolerance.

MECH2023 -24/10 by advanced manufacturing Supervisor: Dr. Xianghai An Eligibility: High achievement in a relevant undergraduate engineering degree (a WAM of 75 or above). This summer project has the option to be co mbined with an honours project . Project Description: Materials come with characteristic combinations of mechanical properties . For example, ceramics have high stiffness but break easily; metals have high strength and ductility but limited ability to defor m elastically. A vital requirement for all structural materials is that they possess an exceptional combination of stiffness, strength, ductility, and damage tolerance. However, these characteristics cannot currently be obtained simultaneously . Although ma terials with different combinations of attributes can be designed by forming composites of different materials, it is still scientifically and technologically challenging to harvest desirable combination of properties. To address these issues, in this pro ject, we will propose a multidesign strategy, which encompasses the deliberate modulation of the phase constitution and architecture of metal - ceramic interpenetrating -phase composites that can be enabled by the combination of advanced manufacturing techniques. The newly designed materials will push the boundar ies of materials properties beyond current benchmark ranges. Requirement to be on campus: Yes *dependent on governmen t's health advice. MECH2023 -24/11 Play with small -scale metals: new insights into micro -plasticity Supervisors: Dr. Xianghai An Eligibility: High achievement in a relevant undergraduate engineering degree (a WAM of 75 or above). This summer project has the option to be combined with an honours project. Project Description: The past two decades have witnessed a rapid increase in demand for micr o/nano devices and components, such as micro/nano -electromechanical systems (MEMS)/(NEMS) sensors, micro - engines, connectors, micro -pumps, and medical implants, to push the boundary of property and functionality for many evolving technologies. This essenti al requirement for device miniaturisation promotes an unprecedented advancement in manufacturing techniques and processes, empowering us to fabricate these small structures at micrometer, submicrometer, and even nanometer scales. During practical applicati on and service, these novel systems would ineluctably suffer from external loading and large deformation. Therefore, their robustness and reliability rely primarily on the mechanical performance of small -sized materials. 26 However, when the external geomet ric sizes of materials are diminished into the micro/nanoscale, their mechanical responses are profoundly distinct from those of bulk counterparts. Comprehensively exploring the mechanical behaviour of the micro -/nano -sized materials is not only significan t scientifically to furnish principal insights into their deformation physics to enrich the theory of crystal plasticity, but also crucial technologically to empower us to exert control over the design and development of cutting -edge MEME/NEMS with predict able, reliable, and reproducible performances.

MECH2023 -24/12 Mechanical behaviour of high -performance and sustainable steels Supervisors: Dr. Xianghai An Eligibility: High achievement in a relevant undergraduate engineering degree (a WAM of 75 or above). This summer project has the option to be combined with an honours project. Project Description: As the backbone of decarbonizing innovations in key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, transportation, and safety, high -performance structural steels are urgently required to address the significant economic, energy -efficient, and environmental challenges. Stronger, tougher steels are always needed to reduce weigh and improve safety in transportation, enhance architectural flexibility in construction, and improve performance in heavy machinery. Adjusting steel composition with the addition of an increasing number of elements is the general approach to a chieving desirable properties. Such a strategy requires more energy for alloys production, entails materials development more resource -dependent, and makes materials recycling more difficult, imposing negative impacts on the long -term sustainability of adv anced steel. Recently, we developed several advanced steels with superior mechanical properties and compositional constraints using efficient manufacturing method. Timely exploiting the knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of these advanced steels is impo rtant both scientifically, for the in -depth comprehension of their deformation behaviour, and technologically, for assessing their service utilities in safety -critical structural components and providing mechanistic strategies for future steel design.

This summer project has the option to be combined with an honours project. Project Description: Additive manufacturing (AM) is revolu tionizing manufacturing processes to build 3D parts by progressively adding thin layers of materials guided by digital models, enabling the fabrication of innovative structures, complex shapes, and customised parts. However, various anomalies commonly occu r during manufacturing due to the improper settings of process parameters, and residual and thermal stresses. Insufficient quality assurance will create material waste, increase production time and prevent AM adoption in advanced fields that require qualit y-assured high -performance parts. Current non -destructive defect detection techniques are post -prduction analysis that largely depends on the operator's experience, making the identification of defects inaccurate and inconsistent. To assess the printing condition and product quality efficiently and accurately, in - situ monitoring systems for detecting defects are highly needed. Although novel image processing methods demonstrate promising progress in real -time anomaly detection, they 27 mainly depend on specific problems and cannot identify different types of defects simultaneously. It has increasingly realised t hat machine learning (ML) methods hold great promise in overcoming these problems as they could analyze underlying patterns and features within datasets. In this project, we will establish imaging systems for in -situ monitoring of the fabrication process a nd develop new ML algorithms for solving multiple real -time anomaly detection problems with high accuracy.

MECH2023 -24/14 Improving mechanical properties of metallic materials via combined compositional and structural heterogeneities Supervisor: Prof. Xiaozhou Liao Eligibility: WAM>80 Project Description: Strength and ductility are among the most important mechanical properties of materials. Materials with high strength and high ductility are desirable for many structural applications. However, achieving both high strength and excellent ductility in structu ral materials poses significant challenge because they often exhibit a trade -off relationship. Significant worldwide efforts have been made looking for solutions to overcome the trade -off. One promising approach is to introduce combined structural and comp ositional gradients. This project aims to explore how different gradient structures affect deformation behaviour and mechanical properties. Combined compositional and structural gradients will be introduced using additive manufacturing and surface mechanic al treatment. The digital image correlation technique will be incorporated during tensile mechanical property testing. Electron microscopy will be used for microstructural characterisation. Through this research, we seek to gain valuable insights into how such gradient structures can potentially enhance materials' performance .

HfO 2-based ferroelectrics show promise for future electronic device applications such as non -volatile memories and neuromorphic computing due to their compatibility with silicon technology and stable ferroelectric properties at the nanoscale. To predict their nanos cale properties and performance, it is crucial to understand how external stimuli affect their microstructures, including different phases, strain, and electric field distribution. This project aims to investigate the impact of external mechanical loading on the microstructure of HfO 2-based ferroelectric single crystals. Advanced transmission electron microscopy techniques will be used to capture atomic resolution images, which will then be analysed using Python -based coding methods. The analysis will yield precise measurements of strain, strain gradient, phase distribution, and local electric field. These quantitative findings will provide valuable insights into how mechanical loading affects the microstructure of the crystals.

Project Description: Understanding the dynamic behaviour of solid -liquid interactions is vital across various industries, including inks, paints, food, and pharmaceuticals, as it directly impacts the dispersion and dissolution characteristics of the solid forms. The primary objective of this project is to assess the real -time k inetics of interactions between pharmaceutical tablets or powder bed and liquids using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with high temporal and spatial resolutions. The technique entails bringing the solid form in contact with liquid and employing OCT ima ging to continuously capture high -resolution cross -sectional images of the evolving internal structure of the wetted material. These time -series OCT images will be analysed to facilitate a quantitative assessment of the liquid's penetration and spreading w ithin the solid form. Such real -time OCT monitoring offers a non -destructive and time -efficient way to study the wettability and internal dynamics of pharmaceutical solid forms, thus providing valuable information for optimizing formulations and improving drug delivery systems.

MECHATRONIC ENGINEERING PROJECTS MECHATRON 2023 -24/1 Data Augmentation for Semantic Segmentation for autonomous Vehicles Supervisor : Dr. Stewart Worrall; Dr. Julie Stephany Berrio Perez; Dr. Mao Shan Eligibility : Programming Skills: Basics in Computer Vision and ML Project Description : The main objective of this project is to enhance data augmentation for semantic segmentation in images, specifically for autonomous driving applications. The project involves applying cutting -edge machine learning techniques to modify the appearance of locally annotated images into various domains. One of the core tasks is image translation, which entails training a machine learning model to t ransform an image from one domain to another. For instance, this could involve converting a daytime image to a night -time or rainy condition image. By performing such data augmentation, the project aims to create a more robust and diverse dataset, which can improve the performance and generalization capabilities of semantic segmentation models used in autonomous driving scenarios. This augmentation process will expose the models to different environmental conditions, preparing them to handle various real-world situations effectively.

Experience with machine learning would be an asset Project Description : Working with researchers at the Australian Centre for Field Robotics, this project will develop novel sensing technologies to enable robots to operate in new domains. Monocular depth estimation is estimating the depth of objects in a scene using a single camera. It has critical applicati ons in robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving. You will work on the depth estimation problem using light patterns as an additional cue. A calibrated camera -projector system is assumed where a projector projects light -coded patterns, and a came ra captures the deformed patterns. The deformed light pattern can be fed into a deep -learning model to estimate the depth map of the scene. The deep learning model will be trained using a dataset of images, and corresponding depth maps to learn the mapping between the input image and its depth. You can also contribute to synthetic dataset generation. We will model a virtual camera - projector 3D sensing system to render the ground truth data for deep learning training .
