Figure 1: Schematic diagram of Intelli-PlateTM (Image created by Felicia Vulcu.) Figure 2: Schematic diagram showing 1 row of the Intelli-PlateTM containing the 6 different sections. Please note, each row on the plate is labeled A-D and each section is labeled 1-6. Each section contains 4 wells and 1 reservoir buffer. (Image created by Felicia Vulcu.) [Please click this hyperlink to watch How to set up the Intelli-Plate](https://www.macvideo.ca/media/Protein+crystal+with+information/1_yjckg8p7) Please note that multiple students can utilize one Intelli-PlateTM Intelli-plate section: Ensure you have labeled the plate PRIOR to loading. 1. Add 600 \u00b5L Well Solution to each reservoir. For each section on the plate: 2. Row A will include the positive control protein solution containing Lysozyme. Prepare a mix of 50% lysozyme solution, 50% well solution to a total volume of 40 \u00b5L in a newly labelled microcentrifuge tube. Aliquot 3 \u00b5L into each sample well; 4 wells per section, 12 wells total. 3. Rows B and C will contain the DHFR protein samples you chose to test from your protein purification experiment. Combine 5 \u00b5L DHFR protein sample 1, 5 \u00b5L Buffer A and 10 \u00b5L Well Solution. Aliquot 3 \u00b5L into each sample well, 4 wells total. 4. Row D will contain the provided DHFR sample (4 mg/mL concentrated. Combine 5 \u00b5L DHFR protein sample 1, 5 \u00b5L Buffer A and 10 \u00b5L Well Solution. Aliquot 3 \u00b5L into each sample well, 4 wells total. When all team members have loaded their samples on the plate, your instructor will help you apply the sealing film. Ensure you have labeled the side of the plate for identification next week. Plates will be incubated at room temperature for 1 week. "}
