Weare especially pleased to have been part of an exceptional partnership with Save the Children ChildCare Support Center inAtlanta to address the special needs of children in family day care.We would like to take thisopportunity to commend Save the Children, particularlyPam Tatum and Nancy Travis for all their efforts to bring about this Famiiy Day Cate Providerresource book. Many hours of research, writing, and testing went into theproduction of this comprehensive and informative manual.This book not only provides very sound nutritional information based on many of the new findings of the U.S. Department ofAgriculture, but itgoes further and to give the reader very thorough and personal guidelinesto follow.Nestl\u00e9 is pleased to haveunderwritten this publication. We wish Save the Childrencontinued success in its efforts to look after the children of this nation andaround the world.Sincerely, Trainer's Introduction Designed to accompanyPromotingWellness A Nutrition,Health and Safety Manualfor Family Child Care Providers Page 1This manual was made possible by an educational grant from Nestle USA, Inc. toSave The Children Child Care Support Center.4 This manual was designed for use by sponsor organizations of the Child and Adult Care Food Program in training family child care providers. It is our hope that sponsor organizations will give each provider herown copy when she enrolls in the food program. Although the manual is nota book most providers will want to read from cover to cover, it is a good reference book for them to have on hand. It is a book a provider can turn to when she has a nutrition or health and safety question or when she is looking fora new recipe or fun activity for the children. It is also a book designed to assist providers in making dietary changes. Chapter 4 is designed as a workbook with spaces for providers to evaluate their diets and record their goals and their personal plans for achieving them.Finally, this manual isa resource for trainers. With its wealth of information, the manual provides numerous options for training and workshop topics.Several steps were taken tosee that the manual is trainer friendly as well as provider friendly. Here are some important features of the manual.Information is presented at different levels so that the manualcan be used for training providersnew to the CACFP, as well as those whohave been in the program for many years. There is \"Primary Informa-tion\" (information every provider should know) and \"Supporting Informa- tion\" (for the provider whowants to know more.) Trainers may choose to focus training sessionson the primary information and refer interestedproviders to the supporting information on a topic, or they may wish to go into more depth on a particular topic and therefore use both the Primary andSupporting Information for training sessions.Many sponsor organizations produce provider newsletters and even more would like to if only they hadmore resources. We have included shortarticles that might be appropriate for reprinting in newsletters. These are referred to in the manual as \"Special Issues.\" We invite sponsororganizations to reprint the \"Special Issues,\" as well as any other part of themanual they find appropriate, in their provider newsletters. There is no need to contact Save The Children for permission. We simply ask that you credit this manual. Page 3 This manual is designed tofit in a 3-ring binder. Thiskind of packagingallows sponsors to addinformation related to theirfood program to themanual and makes thematerials easy to update. Inaddition, this givestrainers greater flexibilityis designing their training orworkshops byallowing them to removeselected chapters or pages or even to reorganizethe entire manual. Forexample, Chapters 2 and 3 are organized around thedietary guidelines forAmericans. Chapter 2 explains the dietary guidelinesand Chapter 3 helpsproviders change their diets to meet the dietaryguidelines. Trainers may choose to focus a training session ononly one ofthe dietary guidelines. Inthat case they wouldchoose only the sectionsrelated to that particulardietary guideline from eachof the chapters. A table of contents isprovided for each chapter,and in the case ofChapters 3 and 4, for eachsection of the chapter. Thetables of contentsnot only make it easy tolocate specific information,but as you will see, areworded in such a way as toassist trainers in developingappropriate learningobjectives for that chapter or section of a chapter. All trainers who have w with family child careproviders know thatproviders want informatien that they can use to improvetheir family childcare home. Wehave done oor hest to addressthis need and have includedseveral helpful charts andlists and pages of practicalsuggestions. If youdo not give your providersthe entire manual, please usethese charts, listsand pages containingpractical suggestions ashand-outs during workshopsor home visits.Hand-outs will encourageproviders to see you as an ally intheir efforts to providequality child care to thechildren in their child carehome.Some providers whoparticipated in our focus groups requested hand-outsto teach parents abouttheir Pages\" areinformation sheets providers can copy and give to the parents ofthe childrenin their care. If you are notgiving each provider a copyof the manualcontaining these pages, usethe pages as hand-outsduring workshops orhome visits. They willbe educational forthe providers as well asparents. 6 Pag e 4 Although the major focus of the manual is nutrition, others topics are alsoaddressed. Here is a brief description of each chapter.Chapter 1: Mealtime in the Family Child Care HomeThis chapter addresses how we feed children. It explores the feeding relationship, family styledining and eating behavior in terms of children's physical and social development. It isdesigned to help providers feed children in a way that promotes a healthy and positive atdtudeabout food and dining.Chapter 2: Understanding The Dietary GuidelinesThis chapter adapts the United States Department of Agriculture's dietary guidelines forAmericans to the needs of children. Nutritional information is presented at two differentlevels to address the training needs of providers with no prior nutrition training and thetraining needs of providers who are somewhat knowledgeable about nutrition.Chapter 3: Changing Your Diet: Making the Dietary Guidelines Work for YouFamily child care providers typically cook and serve the same foods for the children in theircare as they do for themselves and their families. Therefore, changing the children's dietsmeans changing their own diets. This chapter, formatted like a workbook, addresses issuesrelated to change and teaches providers how to evaluate their diets, set dietary goals, developa plan for meeting their goals, and monitor their progress.Chapter 4: Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds: Recipes and Learning Activities for ChildrenOne of the best ways to teach children about food and nutrition, and to introduce them to newfoods, is to involve them in food preparation. This chapter presents approximately 100nutritious recipes for children. Each recipe includes suggestions for involving the childrenin preparation. As a bonus this chapter also offers fun arts and crafts activities and gamesdesigned to teach children about food and nutrition.Chapter 5: Protecting Children's Health: Preventing Infectious Disease and FoodborneIllness.This chapter provides basic information about preventing infectious diseases and foodborneillness. It includes instructions for proper handwashing, diaper changing and the sanitationof toys, equipment and surfaces. It also contains guidelines providers can use in developingtheir health policy and tips on purchasing, storing, preparing, and serving food safely.Chapter 6: Healthy Children in Safe EnvironmentsThis chapter provides basic information about child health and safety concerns. Topicscovered include immunizations, exercise, dental health, lead poisoning, and the safe andproper use of car seats. This chapter also includes a health and safety checklist providers canuse to check their family child care home for safety. Page 57 Ultimately, each sponsor organization will makes it's own decision about distributing andusing this manual. For a variety of reasons, some sponsor organizations may not choose todistribute a manual to each of their enrolled providers. If your sponsor organization does notplan to distribute a copy ofthe manual to each provider,consider these alternatives:Organize your training around a section or sections of the manual. Select importantpages from thesesections or use entire sections for hand-outs during the training. Reproduce pages of the manual in your newsletter.Never let your home visitors show up at a provider's home emptyhanded. Have themcopy pages to use ashand-outs when they visit providers' homes. Make copies of the manualavailable on loan to providers though your lending libraryor resource roomsin the communities you serve.Use your newsletters to letproviders know the manual is available. Include an articledescribing the contents of each chapter. Encourage providers to request a copy of themanual or chapter of interest and have home visitors loan or give providers therequested copy.Establish a distribution target for your program. When your staff reads menus, havethem make a note of providers whose menus need improvement and mail or let homevisitors deliver the relevant sections of the manual that will benefit the provider.

Jane Haven, CT.The Georgia Association of Family Day Care ProvidersThe Child and Adult Care Food Program Sponsor's ForumThe Staff of Save The Children Child Care Support Center Page 9 How Adults Learn 1 2Page I I In order to use this manualto design effective training for your providers, it is helpful to understand how adults learn. Here are some characteristics of adult learners that you should keep in mind as you developyour workshop or training program. 1. Studies show that after 60 days, adults remember only 25% of what they hear and only 45% of what they hear andsee. These are not inspiring numbers for an educator or trainer who hopes to have lasting impact. Fortunately, by adding an activity or a \"doing\" component to your training or workshop, youcan increase what adults remember to about 70%. In other words, if you want adults to learn and to remember what they learn, involve them actively in the learning process.2. Adult learners are highly pragmatic. They have a need to apply what they learn to \"real- world\" concerns and situations. Further, they must feel that what they are learning is meaningful and worthwhile and applies to their life situation. This is one of the factors that led to the development ofa nutrition training manual designed especially for family child care providers. Consider this point when you select training materials. If you use materials that are not designed for providers, adapt them to a provider's needs. Don't make it the provider's responsibility to relate the lessons to their particular situation.3. Adults bring knowledge and experience to their learning and are motivated by training materials and methods that refer and relate to the learner's past experiences. Experience seems to be among the best teachers when it comes to child care, and as a trainer, experiencedproviders are among your best training resources. Give providers credit for their knowledge and experience, and an opportunity to share it with other providers.4. The ideal environment for adult learning is one whichencourages group discussion and places emphasis on interactions, processes, and skills development. Have adult learners Eit in circles, in U-shaped seating arrangements or in small groups. This facilitates interaction. Placing adults in rows, sitting one behind the other, with you lecturing from the front of the room is a quick way to /imit group interaction and learning.5. The ideal learning dynamic for adults is one that allows participants to debate, challenge and share ideas. Successful trainers listen to and respect the opinions of learners, encourage learners to be resources to them and to each other, and above all, remember to treat adult learners like adults.From: Zimmerman, et al., \"Qualitative Research for Program Development: A Training Curriculum,\" PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health), Washington, D.C., 1991.

They have a senseof progress towardtheir From: Knowles, M.S.The Adult Learner:A Neglected Species.Houston: Gulf PublishingCompany, 1984. 1 4 Page 14 Even though adult learners share many characteristics, thereare variations in learning styleswithin the group. Some adults learn by reading or listeningto lectures, some learn best by doing, and still others learn best by interacting and sharing thoughts and ideas with others.In individual trainingor training provided through amonitoring visit, personalize the training for the provider'slearning style.In a group trainingor workshop situation, recognizethe variety of learning styles and employ a variety oftechniques and formats in training.The list that follows presentsthe strengths and limita-tions of a variety of trainingtechniques.

It is developing a workshop that holds the providers' interest while sharing useful knowledge and skills that can be a challenge. The list of ingredients that follows will help you to make your workshop a success with family child care providers.1. Choose topics that meet the needs of family child care providers.Providers will be interested in topics that help them deal with the challenges and issuesthey face in their personal and professional lives. They will be motivated to learn creative ways for dealing with any of these basic \"needs.\"2. Incorporate practical, usable information.Although the theoretical information has its place, most providers will be interested ina common sense approach to a topic. They will appreciate ideas that help them meet every day challenges with confidence and expertise.3. Know your subject matter well.\"Faking it\" won't work with providers or any other group of adult learners. They expecttheir instructor to know more about the subject matter than they do. Thoroughly saturateyourself with knowledge ofyour topic before attempting to \"teach\" others about it.4. Prepare to meet a widerange of expectations.Every group of adults will bring different perspectives and expectations to a workshop.Be prepared to answer tough questions and respond to different viewpoints. Flexibility is the key to satisfying the needs of the group.5. Plan to use a multi-media approach.The use of a variety of presentation methods will add interest to any session and increase the potential for all participants to grasp the concepts being presented. Wheneverpossible, incorporate other viewpoints through the use of videos, tape cassettes, etc.6. Use visual learning aids to facilitate learning.Emphasize main concepts through the use of clearly printed, legible visual aids. The use of an overhead projector or flipchart are popular methods of incorporating visual organization into a presentation. Page 191 9 7. Practice Presentationskills.As corny as it sounds,nothing can beat theeffectiveness of practicing your presentationin front of a mirror.Relax, use a pleasant toneof voice, and appropriatebody language.Make adjustments ifcertain parts of thepresentation seem to dragand get an idea of thetime involved in presentingeach concept thoroughly. 8. with chalkboard, andother functionaldetails of Plan tomake as necessary. 9. Validate trainingthrough studentparticipation.Adults learn best are Arrive early set upthe room for training.Adjust chairs and tables asdesired. Set up presentationmaterials so that everything isaccessible and ready tobe used. Check the roomtemperature to be sureit is set at acomfortable level.11. Consider offeringrefreshments.A fresh pot of coffee, apitcher of juice, and aplate of cookies or fruit go along way inhelping adults feel welcomeand comfortable. 12. Greet eachparticipant as they arrive.Adult learners are Make introductionseasier with name tags.Name tags can be theoffice supply store \"Hello, my name is...\" variety or anice extensionof the theme of theworkshop. The use of name tags helps everyone to learneach other'sname withouthaving to repeatedly ask do not getfrustrated waiting for thesession to begin. 15. Start the session ontime.Prompt adherence to theplanned schedule demonstrates respect for the timeparticipantshave devoted to (andsometimes paid for) thelearning experience. Keepin mind that theimpression formed duringthe first three minutesof the session will setthe tone for theentire workshop. Page 20 16. Take time to get acquainted.Adult learners need the opportunity to become part of a group before they will feelcomfortable enough to share their experiences. By introducing themselves and providinginformation about who they are, individuals discover how they fit in to the goup and findways to function together.17. Establish ground rules.Take responsibility for establishing a \"safe\" learning environment. Make it clear thateveryone is welcome to participate, everyone's opinions are valued, and everyone has aright to be there. Ridicule, prejudice, conversat'onal monopolies, or pressure to performhave no place in an adult learning environment.18. Set specific goals and objectives.Get a feel for the needs and expectations of the group. Develop a clear-cut plan for meetingthose needs. Be clear about which objectives must be met and which are flexible.19. Appeal to all 5 senses.The more ways learners receive information, the more likely they are to internalize it. Astraight lecture approach will result in an average of 8% retention for most participants.By providing opportunities to hear, see, touch, feel, and smell, all types of adult learnersare able to respond to their personal learning style in receiving new information.20. Empower students to become active learners.Use a variety of participatory and sensory learning techniques to draw the participantsout of themselves. By providing hands-on learning experiences, the process takes onpersonal meaning and provides an opportunity for participants to tTuly master theconcept.21. Honor individual participation comfort levels.While everyone should feel free to participate, active pardcipation should not be forced.In any group situation there will be those who prefer to sit back and absorb all that ishappening. Everyone should have the right to \"pass\" on any activity they do not feelcomfortable actively participating in.22. Refuse to allow conversational monopolies.Input from all students should be welcomed and encouraged. However, allowing a fewpeople to continually monopolize class time with their \"life story\" is sure way to alienateothers in the group. Keep conversations directed and focused to avoid this embarrassingscenario. Page 2121 23. Be considerate ofphysical needs.There is a lot of truth to the statement \"The mind can only absorb what the seat canendure.\" Remember that most providers will have already put in a 8 - 12 hour day. Allowadequate \"stretch and snack\" breaks.24. Keep interest throughvariety.Keep participants involvedin the workshop by utilizing a variety of techniques.Incorporate lecture, discussion, hand-outs, group activities, and written assignments tokeep the pace lively andentertaining.25. Share resources to encourage growth.Be prepared to supply the names of books and other resourcesthat would offer interestedlearners an opportunity to pursue additional information on a topic. 26. Add a finishing touch toeach session.Adults need the opportunity to feel finished, say good-bye to the group, and gain theirsense of oneness.Prepare a closing exercise that will reiterate major objectives of theworkshop, have clear directions, require total group participation, and celebrate thelearning experience.27. Evaluate the workshopeffectiveness.Provide participants with aforum to honestly evaluate the presentation or workshop.Adult learners need to share the growth and/or frustrations fostered through the learningsituation. Ask candid questions about the strengths andweaknesses of your presentationand be prepared too makeadjustments in future presentations.28. Conclude each session ontime.Prolonging a workshop past the scheduled ending will close the workshop on a negativenote. Honor the adultlearner's need for a predictable schedule and show her respect.Begin and end on time. From: Anita Payne, Directorof Child Care, Frank PorterGraham Child DevelopmentCenter, University of NorthCarolina, Chapel Hill, NorthCarolina, July, 1993. 22 Page 22 About Family ChildCare Providers 23Page 23 In addition to information about how adults learn, there aresome general characteristics of family childcare providers and their work that you should remember when you plana workshop or training event.Although family child care nas been around for a very long time, it has only been withinrecent years that providers have begun to think of themselves as professionals. Some people, a few providers included, still think of family child care as littlemore than \"babysitting.\" This image fails to acknowledge the vast array of skills required in family child care and the important role child care providers play in the lives of young children and their workingparents. In addition, this \"babysitter\" image does not encourage or support professional development and training among providers. Always treat family child care providers as the valuable professionals they are. Do what you can to promote professionalism in family child care.Family child care providerscome from variety ofcultural and educational backgroundsand bring with them a large variety of skills and interests. Some of them received their family child care training from other providers, others have graduate degrees in early childhood education, and still others learned \"on the job.\" Some providers will come to your training with a great interest in nutrition, health and safety, while others may be there primarily to meeta training requirement. Although this diversity within the profession is one of its strengths, it can make training more challenging. As a trainer, remember that family child care providers may reflect more diversity than many other groups you might train and develop your workshops accordingly.Most family child care providers work long hours. In most cases, by the time they reachyour workshop they have put in more than a full day's work. Do what you can to makeproviders comfortable. Provide them with snacks and stretch breaks. Above all, do not waste a provider's time. Always come to your training sessions well prepared and ready to capture providers' interest. Make a habit of starting and ending your sessions on time.Many providers are relatively isolated from other family child care proviezrs. Theyspend their days caring for children and may have little opportunity or energy to formprofessional relationships. Profes!;ional relationships are important for a number ofreasons. They support the image c f the provider as a professional, they give providersa chance to share their knowledge and experience, and they provide a forum for mutual support. Allow some time during your workshops for providers to socialize and get to know one another. Engage in an activity that encourages interaction prior to your workshop breaks. Your workshop may be one of providers' few opportunities to meet other providers and learn of other training opportunitiesor professional organizations in their area.

And actually, no one expects you to. For the mostpart, this manual is a reference book. It is written so that you can browse through it and pick out the section or pages of interest to you. Keep themanual handy and refer to it when you have a question about 'nutrition,health or safety, or whenyou are looking for new recipe or fun activityfor the children.

Page p 9 Special Features ofthe ManualFamily child care providerswere consulted throughout the development of this manual. They were seen asour experts on both what information to include in the manual and how to present it. Here are some important features of the manual thatwere included as a result of provider input.Information is presented at different levels. Providers who want just the basic information about a topic can read the\"Primary Information.\" Providers who would likemore information can also read the \"Supporting Information.\"We have included short articles about related issues thatmay be of interest to providers. Many of themare the result of questions asked by providers during provider reviews of the manual. These articles are called \"Special Issues.\"The manual is designed to fit in a 3-ring binder. This allows you to add your own notes or hand-outs you receive at workshops and to remove recipes or other pages you might want to temporarily separate from the rest of the manual.One of the requestswe heard over and over from providers was \"Give us recipes!\" Chapter 4 of this manual containsmore than 100 recipes andeven tells you how to credit them on your CACFP menu forms.Providers also expressedan interest in teaching children about nutrition in a way that would be fun and entertaining. We included several arts and crafts activities and games in Chapter 4. In addition, with each recipe we suggest ways that children can help. Before you try any of these suggestions, read the introduction to Chapter 4. It will give you information that will helpyou to determine if a particular activity is appropriate for the age of children in your childcare home as well as information that will help you to make the activity safe and successful.To make it easier foryou to locate specific information, a table of contents is provided for each chapter. In thecase of Chapters 2 and 3, a table of contents is provided for each section of the chapters.Providers stressed tous that they wanted useful information and practical suggestions. Where possible they wanted the information presented in the form of charts or lists that they could post in the kitchen if they chose to. We have included several chart and lists and pages of practical suggestions.Many providers we spoke with t xpressed the need to pass on what they learn about nutrition to , .arents. With each manual we have included \"Parents Pages.\" These are information sheets designed for providers to photocopy and give to theparents. With each manual, there is one copy of each of the 5 \"Parent's Pages\". Use these originalsto make your copies. Page 530 Manual OverviewAlthough the major focus of the manual is nutrition, other topicsare also addressed. Here is a brief description of each chapter of the manual.Chapter 1: Mealtime in the Family Child Care HomeThis chapter addresses howwe feed children. It explores the eating relationship, family style dining and eating behaviors in terms of children's physical and social development. It is designed to help you feed children in a way that promotes a healthy and positive attitude about food and dining.Chapter 2: Understanding the Dietary Guidelines. This chapter adapts the United States Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines for Americans to the nutritional needs of children. It contains information that will help you in preparing nutritious meals for the children in your care as well as foryou and your own family.Chapter 3: Changing Your Diet: Making the Dietary Guidelines Work for You For those of you whoprepare foods for the children that you and your families will also eat, following the dietary guidelines for the children in your care means changing your and your family's diet. Making healthful changes in your diet is never easy, but chapter 3 is designed to help you. This chapter is formatted like a workbook and is designed to help you evaluate your diet, set goals for change, develop a planto meet those goals, and monitor your progress. Change is always easier when you have group support. Ask your food program sponsor, or even your professional provider association, for a group workshop using this chapter.Chapter 4: Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds: Recipes and Learning Activities for Children One of the best ways to teach children about food and nutrition, and to introduce them to new foods, is to involve them in food preparation. This chapterpresents over 100 nutritious recipes for children. Each recipe includes suggestions for involving children in preparation. As a bonus, this chapter also contains funarts and crafts activities and games designed to teach children about food and nutrition.Chapter 5: Protecting Children's Health: Preventing Infectious Disease and Foodborne IllnessThis chapter provides basic information about preventing infectious disease and foodborne illness. It includes instructions forproper handyashing, diaper changing, and the sanitation of toys, equipment, and surfaces. It also offers guidelines for you to use in developing a health policy for your child care hone and bps on purchasing, storing, preparing, and serving foods safely.Chapter 6: Healthy Children in Safe EnvironmentsThis chapter contains basic information about child health and safetyconcerns.

However, you may not beaware of all that goes into the program before it reaches your foodprogram sponsor.The Child and Adult Care Food Program is actually a federalprogram. The federal laws governing theprogram are established by Congress.The CACFP operates in each state through a state agency. In some states the Department of Human Resource is responsible for theprogram. In other state the Department of Education is responsible.A non-profit agency/organization in each community thenacts as a sponsor to sponsor family child care homes that wish to participate in theprogram.The program responsibilities of the state agency, thesponsor, and the provider are listed on the following page.

Page 17 CHAPTER 1 MEALTIMEIN THEFAMILY CHILD CARE HOME 3 9 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home In the introduction you will learn about: Page 1your 4 major mealtime tasks 4 0 This manual was made possible by an educational grant from Nestle USA, Inc. toSave The Children Child Care Support Center.page 3 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home Before we address the issue of what to feed children, we need to look at howwe feed them, at mealtimein the family day care home.How we offer children nutritious foods and the mealtimeenvironment we help to create, can impact what foods childreneat, how much they eat, and how they feel about food, eating,themselves, and others.Just as children are not likely to develop a healthy diet unless theyare surrounded by healthyfood choices, children are not likely todevelop a healthy attitude toward food and eating if they do notexperience mealtime as a positive, nurturing time. As a family child care provider you knowthat there is much more to mealtime than satisfy-ing children's appetites. There are 4 major tasksto accomplish during mealtime.1. You want children to get the nutrients andcalories they need for growth and develop-ment. Children have small stomachs andusually can't eat much in one meal. That iswhy it is important that the foods they areoffered are nutritious and that they are alsooffered nutritious snacks between meals.Chapters 2 and 3 focus on nutrition and willhelp you in providing for children's nutri-tional needs.2. You want children to learn about foodsand nutrition. Children need to learn how tomake good food choices for themselves. Theyalso find learning fun. One of the best ways toteach children about food and nutrition isthrough involving them in food preparation.Chapter 4 offers many suggestions of wayschildren can help you to prepare snacks andmeals. It also offers a few special learningactivities you and the children might enjoy.3. You want mealtime, like the other activi-ties children engage in throughout the day,to contribute toward children's self-es-teem. Two important factors in buildingchildren's self-esteem are feelings of controland competency.In order to feel some control, childrenneed to be allowed to choose and make deci-sions for themselves. This is especially im-portant in matters that have to do with theirown bodies, like for example what foods toput in their bodies and when t%eir bodies feelfull. Children should be allowed to choosefrom a nutritious selection of foods, whatand how much they eat. Page 341 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home To develop a sense of competency, chil-dren must be allowed to experiment andmanipulate things in their world. For ex-ample, children should be allowed to servethemselves as soon as they are developmen-tally capable. They must be allowed to maketheir own messes and mistakes and learn torecover from them. As a provider, your roleis to structure the mealtime environmentin a way that allows and facilitateschildren's feelings of control and compe-tency. You will learn more about this inthis chapter.4. You want mealtime to be a pleasant andenjoyable experience for both you and thechildren. Mealtime should be a time of sharedconversation, of social and emotional bond-ing. Children should leave the table satisfiedboth physically and emotionally. They shouldbe relaxed and ready to move to a quietactivity or nap.This chapter focuses on helping you toachieve these last two goals. It helps you tounderstand your role and responsibilities in feed-ing the children and explains how family styledining can assist you in meeting your feedinggoals. Page 442 soMealtime in the Family Child Care Home In this chapter you will learn aboutthe feeding relationship 1page 7and family style diningpage 13 There is also a helpful chart onthe development of mealtime behavior 1 page 16 These is also information on special issues:introducing children to new foods page 18common challenges infeedingpage 19and what to do if a child is choking page 22 Page 54 3 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should KnowAnyone who has ever worked with chil-dren knows that you can put food on the table butyou can not make the children eat it. Still many ofus try. We try bribes- \"If you eat your vegetables,you'll get dessert% threats \"You'll have to sitthere until you clean your plate\", and tricks, {I'lljust hide a few peas in this casserole. Lisa willnever notice. )Food fights are battles we are not likely towin. Even if we do manage to get a child to eat thefood item once, it is doubtful that he or she willhave a good feeling about it and will willingly eatit the next time we offer it. This is why someproviders find feeding children frustrating. Youcan prepare a very nutritious meal only to havesome children refuse to eat part of it. And if, forexample, they choose to only eat the meat, leavingthe vegetables and bread, they are not reallygetting the well-balanced meal you prepared.If these concerns or frustrations soundfamiliar, remember these 3 points:1. While you don't control children's choices,you do control the foods they get to choosefrom. If childrencan only choose fromnutritious offerings, they will make nutri-tious choices.2. In terms of getting a well-balanced meal,\"well-balanced\" refers to their overall diet,the snacks and meals they eat over a periodof a few days. Research has shown that evenchildren who go on food jags in which theyseem to only eat a fewspecific foods, willnaturally eat a balanced diet over time.(Food jags are discussed further on page 20.3. You can offer children foods, and evenencourage them to try foods, but stay out offood fights. As a provider, your energies arebest spent in preparing nutritious snacksand meals for children and providing themwith a positive, nurturing environment inwhich to eat them.In order to make mealtime a self-esteembuilding experience for children, and an enjoy-able experience for everyone, it is important tounderstand what part of mealtime is your respon-sibility and what part is the children's responsibil-ity. In her book How To Get Your Child To Eat...But Not Too Much, Ellyn Satter (1987, BullPublishing Co. Palo Alto, CA.) divided the re-sponsibility of the provider and the responsibilityof the child in the following way.The responsibilities of the provider are:Selecting and buying food. Page 7You are responsible for purchasing foodthat is safe, nutritious, and appetizing. You arealso responsible in part for introducing childrento the wide variety of available foods.Some parents have little time in theirschedules for introducing children to new foodsand experimenting with a variety of ways toprepare them. Instead, theyMay choose foodsthat are easy to prepare and that they know theirchildren will eat. Most of you serve the childrenin your care 2 meals and two snacks, five day aweek. That makes up a large portion of a child' soverall diet. You have many opportunities tointroduce children to new foods and to helpthem to develop heathy eating habits. 4 4 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home Try to disregard your ideas about whatchildren will and will not like and serve them awide variety of foods. (For more informationon introducing children to new foods, see thespecial issue on page 18. You will read moreabout the importance of serving a variety offoods in Chapter 2.)Making and presenting meals.It is the provider's responsibility to givechildren well balanced meals and nutritioussnacks. (Chapters 2,3, and 4 will help you meetthis responsibility.) It is also important that foodbe presented in a way that encourages childrento eat it.The way foods are presented seem tomatter a great deal to some children. Manytimes a child will decide, simply by looking,whether or not they are willing to try a new food.Many children will not eat vegetables that areover-cooked and \"mushy\" looking. For somereason, many 2 year olds like to keep foodsseparate from one another. Not only do they notwant their carrots and peas cooked together, butsome two year olds don't even want them totouch each other on the plate. Some childrenwill eat a sandwich cut diagonally, while theywon't take one bite if the sandwich is cut insquares.When it is possible, consult the childrenabout how they want their foods to look. Alsotry to make foods interesting to children byoffering a variety of colors, shapes and tex-tures. Consider letting the children help youin preparing snacks and meals. (Chapter 4will give you several ideas about ways childrencan participate in making and presenting meals.)Regulating the timing of meals and snacks.Children need regular eating times formeals and snacks so that they can learn toregulate their own eating. Of course, you shouldnot make children eat just because it is lunchtime or punish them for not eating. However,you must set limits. Establish regular eatingtimes and stick to them. Let children knowthat there will not be another opportunity toeat until the next snack time or meal time.Children will soon become accustomed to youreating schedule. As with most rules, there are some excep-tions. Some parents may bring their children toyour home after you have served breakfast.Don't just assume that because you have servedbreakfast, children arriving later have alreadyeaten. Ask them if they have had breakfast. Ifthey have had breakfast, find out what they ateand when. They might have eaten a very smallbreakfast, for example, only a piece of toast, orhave eaten much earlier than the other childrenin your care. They may not be able to wait untilthe morning snack.In some states providers enrolled in theCACFP must offer children food at regularintervals. For some states food must beoffered elvery 4 hours. In other states foodmust be offered every 2 hours. Becomefamiliar with your state's regulations. Postyour feeding schedule with your weeklymenu.Presenting food in a form children can handleand can eat safely.Most children are messy eaters, regardlessof how you present the food. Children youngerthan 18 months will not be able to use utensils.They will eat with their hands. After 18 monthsthey will begin learning to use utensils, but itwill still take them a while to develop the motorskills and coordination needed to use utensilswell. Give children the freedom to be messyeaters so that they have the opportunity tobecome good eaters. Don't make a big deal ofthe messes they make at the table. Just givethem what they need to clean up the messand assist them when and if they need it.Page 845 Toddlers are a special concern when itcomes to eating safely. They gag often whenthey are first learning to eat. It is normal forchildren to gag when they are learning to eat.They have not yet become good at positioningthe food in their mouths. When the food slipsback on their tongue, they automatically gag. Ifa child is coughing forcefully and getting air,let them dislodge the food item on their own.However, if a child is wheezing, gasping,whistling or turning colors, they are chokingand need immediate first aid. (See page 22 inthis chapter for what to do if a child ischoking.)In the box below are suggestions of waysyou can present foods that will increase chil-dren' chances at successful eating. In the box onthe right are steps you can take to preventchoking.Making Foods Easy For a Toddler to EatCut foods into bite-sized pieces, cut meat upfinely.Make some foods soft and moist.Serve foods near to room temperature.Substitute ground beef patties for steaks orchops.Serve salads without dressing as finger food.Make soups thin enough to drink or thickenough to spoon.Give children a plate or bowl with sides topush the food against.Meattime in the Family Child Care Home Preventing ChokingGradually build a child's feeding skills; lf.ther work up slowly to more difficult foal.).For the child under three, avoid foods thatare hard to control in the mouth, chewand swallow. This includes nuts, raw car-rots, gumdrops and jelly beans. Do not servehard candy, raw vegetables and fruits, grapes,raisins, seeds, corn, peanut butter, popcorn,pickles, nuts, olives, or thick sticky cheesefoods to children until after their 2 yearmolars have appeared and they are chewingwith them. If you serve hot dogs, the num-ber one cause of choking in children,quarter them lengthwise to reduce therisk of choking. If you serve a food whichcontains pieces of hot dogs, like Beans andFranks, quarter the pieces so that they are notcircular. Other foods might also be modifiedto reduce the risk of choking. For example,grapes can be quartered and carrots cooked.Always be present during feeding. Neverlet other children supervise.Keep children seated while they are eat-ing. Most choking occurs when children areon the run.Keep things calm at eating time. Whenchildren scream or laugh they catch theirbreath and they could inhale food causingthem to choke. (The information on making foods easy for atoddler to eat and preventing choking comesfrom Ellyn Satter, 1987, How to Get YourKid to Eat... But Not Too Much, p.185-186,Bull Publishing Co., Palo Alto, CA.) Page 9 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home Making mealtime pleasant.There is much you can do to make eatingtime pleasant and relaxed. Consider the sugges-tions below.Have a quiet transition activity to movefrom more active play to dining.If the children have been real active priorto a meal, it might be difficult for them to sit atthe table and focus on eating. Try giving chil-dren a few minutes to look at a book, tell thema story, or let them help you set the table.Give children child-sized utensils, tablesand chairs.Give the children These will be mucheasier for them tomanipulate. Make sure your tables and chairsare also child-sized. It is very important thatchildren, when seated, have support for theirfeet. It is usually uncomfortable and sometimesdifficult for them to stay in their seats when theirlegs are left dangling with nothing to supportthem.Have patience.Learn to be comfortable with the slowpace of children's eating aswell as the inevi-table mess. Children can sense when you are notrelaxed and if you are not relaxed, it will bedifficult for them to relax.Engage in quiet conversation.Join the children at the table and eat withthem. Encourage relaxed conversation. This isa good time to discussthe different foods theyare eating and teachthem about nutrition.Helping the child participate in the meal.Help children to participate in all aspectsof the meal. This includes food preparation,setting the table, eating, engaging in mealtimeconversation, and clean-up. To feel competent,children need to contribute in real ways. Find arole for them whenever you can.Helping the child to attend to his or hereating.Some children become easily distracted.In encouraging pleasant conversation, you alsowant to keep the children focused on eating.Maintaining standards of behavior at thetable.It is important that children enjoy them-selves during the meal, but they also need tolearn that some behaviors are not appropriate atthe table. Some children may want to walk andeat. Let them know that eating is a time foreveryone to gather together at the table. If youare keeping the children at the table, and keep-ing them focused on the task of dining, they willhave few chances to misbehave.When young children put their handsin their food, they are not misbehaving. Chil-dren younger them 18 months will probably eatwith their fingers, and even older children willoften explore food with their hands. This isnormal and acceptable. In fact, if children areallowed to touch foods, they are more likely totaste them.At around 2 or 2 1/2 children will begin tounderstand your instructions not to put theirfingers or hands in serving bowls or in otherpeople's food. It is very important to teachchildren, beginning at a very early age, to washtheir hands before every snack and meal. Notwashing their hands, especially if they touchtheir food before it goes into their mouths, couldmake them ill. (There will be more about this inChapter 5.)The Responsibility of the ChildThe child decides whether he or she eats andhow much he or she eats.Many providers have a difficult timegiving children responsibility for whether theyeat and how much they eat. We worry that somechildren do not eat enough and that other chil-dren eat too much. However, withholding food Page 104 7 from a child or encouraging a child to eat morejust interferes with the child's ability to regulatehis or her own eating.Resist the impulse to interfere in children'sdecisions about eating . Perhaps the child thatsuddenly eats less is not growing as rapidly asbefore. The child who seems to eat a lot may notbe getting enough at home. There could be avariety of reasons for a child's eating behavior.Your interfering could actually make mattersworse. Let your major concern be providingchildren with nutritious food choices and help-ing children develop healthy eating habits andattitudes about food.Mealtime in the Family Child Care HomeThere are rare times when you should beconcerned about whether or not a child is eatingor how much a child iseating. If you have a childwho consistently does not eat well, ask theparent(s) how the child eats at home. If the childalso eats poorly at home, recommend that theparent take the child to see a health care pro-vider. Do not try to solve the problem yourself.Poor eating could be the result of a physicalproblem. Your attempts at getting the child toeat could do more harm than good. 4 8Page 11 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home A ReminderA large piece of any food may cause choking for childrenwho can not yet chew. The foods listed below areespecially dangerous. Do not serve these foods until afterthe 2 year molars have appeared and thechild is chewing on them. Hot Dogs Hard CandyGrapes OlivesSeeds CornPeanut Butter PopcornPickles NutsOlives Thick, sticky cheese foodsNuts RaisinsRaw Vegetables (including Carrots and Celery)Hard Fruits or Fruits With Seeds Some of these foods can be mdoified to reduce the risk of choking.Refer to the information on page 9 orcall your CACFP sponsor if you have a question. 4 9 Page 12 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know Family style dining, where the familygathers together at the table for a meal and quietconversation, is certainly not a new concept. Infact, it is the way many of us grew up eating.Unfortunately, for many young families this styleof dining is a thing of the past. Hectic schedulesand busy life-styles make gathering everyonetogether for a meal almost impossible. Instead,many families seem to eat inshifts and on the run.As you know, meal time for children ismuch more than a time for satisfying nutrient andcalorie requirements. It is a time of.comfort andlearning. Young children not only develop eatingskills and habits and learn about food and nutri-tion, but they also develop socialization skills andlearn about themselves and others. This learningtakes place best in the relaxed, social atmospherecreated by family style dining.The principles of family style dining are:1. Involve the children in preparing the mealand/or setting the table, and cleaning upafterwards. Letting children contribute inways that are meaningfulbuilds their self-esteem. It is also a good way to teach themthings like the names of utensils, how tocount, and right versus left, and help them todevelop motor skills and coordination. (You'llfind more ideas about ways children can helpin Chapter 4. ) Page 132. Gather everyone at the table, and jointhem yourself. Model good table mannersand healthy eating habits. Eat the samefoods that they eat. Be sure you at least tryall of the foods. The children are watchingyou and are more apt to do what you do thanwhat you say. Encourage quiet conversation.Use the opportunity to talk with childrenabout the foods they are eating.3. Create a comfortable place for children toeat and to learn. Use child-sized tables,chairs, serving containers, utensils, pitch-ers etc.4. Place the food in serving containers on thetable. To the extent that children are devel-opmentally ready, let them pass the con-tainers and serve themselves. Some chil-dren may need your help, but restrain yourselffrom helping when it is not really necessary.Expect children to be awkward, slow, andsomewhat messy until they have developedthe coordination and skills needed to useutensils and pass food containers. (The charton page 16 will help you toknow what toexpect from children at different ages. Thereare also suggestions on page 14 for ways youcan help children be successful with familystyle meal service.) Do not put foods hotenough to burn children on the table. 50 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home 5. Offer all of the foods, including a nutri-tious dessert, at the same time. Do not savedessert until last. This recommendation oftensurprises providers and parents. They imme-diately think that children will only eat des-sert. However, research shows that over timechildren will choose foods that provide themwith nutrients and calories they need. If youhave gotten the children accustomed to des-sert coming last, and only after they havefinished the other foods on their plate, then itwill take them a while to learn that dessertfoods are not so special anymore. Holdingdessert back as a treat teaches children thatsome foods are better than others, and thatdessert is something special. If you offerchildren dessert at the same time you offerthem other foods, they may eat it first, but theywill learn not to attach special meaning to it.Some children will still like the dessert foodsbetter than their vegetables, but dessert foodswill be just one part of the meal. Remember,your responsibility is to provide childrenwith nutritious foods to choose from. Thechoice of what and how much to eat istheirs.6. Create a relaxed atmosphere and keepeating at a leisurely pace. Engage the chil-dren in quiet conversation . Keep them fo-cused on the meal, but don't rush them.7. Be patient. Eating neatly takes a lot of skill.Children will have accidents. Don't call toomuch attention to the accident. Simply helpthe children clean up the mess if they need itandcontinue with the meal. Help children be successful at serving themselves and passing foods. Scooping or spooning is easier forchildren when:Spoons are deep and not too large.They are scooping from a container withhigh sides so that they have somethingto push against.The container they are scooping from isplaced at a comfortable distance.The food is not too hot.The food is more solid than liquid. (Ifchildren are serving foods like stew orsoup, try letting them scoop it with aplastic cup with a handle. Ladles aredifficult for children to use.Pouring is easier for children when:They are pouring from a small, clear,plastic pitcher that is less than half full.They are sitting in a comfortable, stableposition.They try to fill their c up or glass no morethan half full.Passing food containers is easier forchildren when:Containers are not too hot, too large,too heavy, or too full.They are encouraged to use bothhands.They pick up the container from thetable rather than taking it from an-other child's hands.Cleaning up messes is easier forchildren when:They are using a sponge rather than acloth.They are not made to feel bad formaking the mess in the first place.They get help if they need it. Page 14 51 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home How do you meet theChild and Adult Care Food Program requirementfor serving size when you allow children to serve themselves? When a children are too young to fully participate in family style meal service, you can putthe required serving size of each meal component on their plates. But once they begin toparticipate in family style meal service, they control thei serving size. They may serve themselvesmore than the CACFP required serving, less than the required serving, or choose not to servethemselves any of a food at all. It is the child's decision which foods to choose and how muchto take from the selection of nutritious foods you offer.The CACFP component requirements are sti Z! very important. They are establishedto provide a well balanced diet that provides chikken with all of the nutrients and caloriesthey need. In addition, you are required to meet these requirements for reimbursement. If a child chooses not to take any of a particular food, do not pressure her. Resist the impulseto say things like \"Just try one bite.\" However, do not take the food off your menus becausea child chooses not to serve him or herself any. The more familiar children become with a food,the more likely they are to eat it. Next time they may try it, and eventually they may like it, andsoon they may choose to eat the required serving size. Try cooking the food a different way, orin the case of vegetables, serving it raw and with a dip.If a child continues to refuse a food after it has been offered several times, replace it in yourmenus with other food items that meets the CACFP component requirements. Try to replace itwith a food that provides similar nutrients. For example, if you serve spinach and childrencontinually refuse it, look for another green leafy vegetable to serve instead. Try broccoli orturnip greens. Children's taste do change however, so don't eliminate spinach forever. Give itanother try in a few months.If you have child who continues to refuse all of the foods that fit one of the componentrequirements, like vegetables for example, consider planning a special activity that mightinterest the child in the food and encourage him/her to try it. With vegetables for example,consider a field trip to a garden or a farmer's market. (There are more ideas in Chapter 4.) If children take less than the required amount of a food item, wait until they have eaten whatthey put on their plate and offer them a second serving. Let them decide if they want the secondserving and how big that second serving should be.Remember: Never bribe, threaten, or trick children into eating. Mealtime is not only aboutchildren getting nutrients and calories, it is also about children developing a positiveattitude about food and mealtime. Page 15 Mealtime in the Family Child Care HomeThe Development of Mealtime BehaviorThis chart provides information on children's appetites, food preferences, independence andability to participate in family style dining. It covers children from age 1 to age 3. Remember that theseare just general guidelines. Do not expect all of your children to fit these descriptions exactly.1 Year OldAppetite:May not eat equally well at all meals.RefusJs and Preferences:May refuse milk from a bottle especially if new nipple style or some other change has been made.Favorite bottle is the evening one. Food preferences are becoming well-defined; usually showa preference for certain cereals and vegetables.Independence and Ability to Participate in Family Style Dining:May finger feed part of meal. A few refuse any help. Many insist on standing to eat. May needtoy or two to hold if being fed. Some children this age can begin to sit in a three-sided chair.Whether in a three-sided chair or high chair, pull them up to the dining table to join the otherchildren. Expect children this age to be very messy eaters. Be prepared with patience and lotsof paper towels.18 Months OldAppetite:May be decreasing. Usually less than that of vigorous infant. Appetite usually best for noon meal.Refusals and Preferences:Changes a lot.Independence and Ability to Participate in Family Style Dining:Enjoys feeding self. May do so for all of the meals with some help in filling spoon. Definitelyshould join the other children at the dining table, preferably sitdng in a three-sided chair. Maywant to eat off other's plates or out of serving bowl. If there is room at the table, seat the 18 monthold so that other children' plates are out of his/her reach. Should be an increase in the amountof time they spend at the table. May be able to pass some foods with your help. Should be ableto give you the empty dish when finished.2 Years OldAppetite:Fair to moderately good. Noon meal usually best.Refusals and Preferences:Two year olds typically show a sharp decrease in appetite as their rate of growth is slower thanthe fust year. They may become discouraged by large servings. Many are fussy, hard to pleaseor go on food jags or refusals. Can name foods and likes and dislikes. Don't like strained foodsor foods mixed together. Like whole pieces of foods. May like certain tastes, shapes, feels, colors,especially red or yellow. 5 3Page 16 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home Independence and Ability to Participate in Family Style Dining:Most two year olds are ready to sit at the table in regular chairs. They are learning to manipulateserving spoons and pour from small pitchers with assistance. They can begin to serve themselvesand some of them may be able to pass bowls or plates of foods. Some 2 year olds can feedthemselves v, ithout help and may not want anyone near by. Others may need help. There tendsto be two extreme groups of eaters: messy and neat. Children this age can scizip, leftover foodoff their plates into the garbage and put their dirty plates, silverware, and cups in the appropriateplaces. They can usually clean up their own spills.2 112 Years OldAppetite:Often varies between very good and very poor. Usually eats one good meal - noon or evening.Refusals and Preferences:More defined than at 2 years of age. Food jags continue. (You will read more about food jagson page 20.) May favor meat, fruit, butter. Feeds self preferred foods. Eats other foods if fed.Totally refuses to eat disliked foods, especially green vegetables. (This does not mean you shouldstop offering green vegetables. Eventually a child may try them and like them.)Independence and Ability to Participate in Family Style Dining:May feed self entire meal or want to eat some and ask for help with the rest. Likes routines.Demands same foods, dishes, or arrangement of dishes. Children this age can pass foods and arebecoming good at manipulating serving spoons.3 Years OldAppetite:Fairly good. Improved appetite from age 2. Less changeable than before. Milk intake may beincreasing.Refusals and Preferences:Less defined than earlier. Meat, fruit, milk, dessert, sweets favored but also eats vegetables. Likesfoods that need chewing. May ask for special foods as meal is prepared. Fluctuating tastes mayappear at this age.Independence and Ability to Participate in Family Style Dining:Feeds self. Eats well. Demands for attention while eating may be excessive. Begins to masterpouring and mastering serving utensils and can scoop and balance. Understands the concept ofquantity better (as in the command \"just take one\"). Begins to understand the concept of sharingand can pass foods.4 and 5 Years OldWhen children reach this age they have mastered the mechanics of eating and have learned theskills needed to participate fully in family style dining. They are usually more interested in colors,textures, and tastes of foods and may be more willing to try new foods. They are also beginningto develop very individual tastes and food preferences. Children this age love to be helpful. Givethem specific duties. Page 1754 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home Special Issue: introducing Children to New FoodsYoung children are not too adventurous when it comes to trying new foods.Research shows that sometimes children have to be offered a food 8 to 10 times beforethey feel comfortable enough to try it. This can be a frustrating experience for bothparents and providers. Preparing foods, only to have children refuse to eat them, can feellike a waste of both time and money.It might be best to consider foods offered to and rejected by children as aninvestment. And like most investments, given time, it may eventually pay off. Inpreparing a new food that a child refuses to eat, you have at least exposed the child tothe food. Perhaps the next time they are offered the food, or maybe the time after that,your investment will pay of. The child may try the food and like it. Here are some thingsthat you can do to help children accept new foods.Introduce only one new food at a time.Serve the new food with familiar foods.If you are serving the child (if the child is too young to serve him/herself),serve only small amounts of the new food.Introduce new foods only when children are hungry.Talk about the new food- it's taste, color, texture etc.Let the children see you eating and enjoying the new food.Encourage children to taste the new food. If they reject it, accept the refusaland try again in a few weeks.Find out what is not liked about the new food. It may be something you canchange, like the way the food is prepared. Sometimes a child will refuse a foodcooked one way, but like it cooked another way.In spite of the frustration you may sometimes feel, it is very important that youcontinue to introduce children to new foods and to offer them foods they reject. If youdo not, children may not have the variety they need in their diets for proper growth anddevelopment. In addition, they will be robbed of the opportunity to experience new tastesand textures and to add new foods to their diet. Source: Healthy Young Children: A Manual For Programs.

Page 1855 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home Special Issue:Common Challenges in Feeding Children111=1111111111,01WThere are many challenges when it comes to feeding children. Fortunately, whenwe see a healthy, happy child eating well and enjoying it, we realize there are also manyrewards. Below are some of the major challenges. In some cases, we offer helpfulsuggestions. In other cases, we simply advise patience.Child Has A Small ApretiteChildren have days when they eat a lot and days when they eat only a little. Thisis because children do not grow at a constant rate. They grow in spurts. During a growthspurt they typically eat more. When the growth spurt ends, their appetites naturallydecrease. In addition to day to day changes in appetite, most children's appetites decreaseat about age 1. At this age the growth rate usually decreases, so it is natural for the appetiteto lessen. If you are feeding a child with a small appetite, do not try to force or trick himor her into eating. There isprobably a good reason for the decrease in appetite. Instead,make sure the foods you offer are nutritious ones so that the calories children do consumewill give them the vitamins and minerals they need.Child Consistently Refuses to EatA child who consistently refuses to eat may have a serious physical or emotionalproblem.Don' t try to force or bribe if ; child to eat. You could actually make thingsworse. Recommend that parents take the child to see a health professional.Child Will Not Eat VegetablesVegetables seem to have a bad reputation among children. In part this may bebecause many people do not expect children to like vegetables. Therefore they do notoffer many vegetable choices. In truth, vegetables may take a little more effort than a hotdog. But a healthy child is worth it.Give children a real chance to like vegetables. Try preparing vegetables indifferent ways. Many children prefer them steamed lightly so that they retain their brightcolors and their texture. Try offering raw vegetables with dip for the afternoon snack.(Make sure children are old enough to safely chew and swallow raw vegetables. Do notgive raw vegetables to children under two.) Give children the opportunity to learn aboutvegetables and to become comfortable with them. Let them select vegetables at the store.Let them help you prepare the vegetables. Most children can do things like tear lettuce,snap fresh green beans or wash vegetables for you. They can also arrange cut vegetableson a snack tray. Talk withchildren about vegetables. Use vegetables to teach them tocount and to teach them their colors . Use vegetables to teach shapes and concepts like Page 19513 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home big and small. Try taking children on a field trip to a garden so that they can see vegetablesgrowing. The more you expose children to vegetables, the bigger the chance they will likethem.Child Goes on Food Jags Demanding the Same Food Over and OverFood jags are common among preschoolers. Often these periods of demandingthe same food over and over are an expression of a preschooler's independence. If youstay calm and treat them casually, they usually pass relatively quickly. As long as the foodthe child is demanding is not just empty calories- (high in sugar with little nutritionalvalue)be patient until the food jag passes.Child Has Food RitualsMany 2-4 year old children develop food rituals. They may be rituals such asalways eating foods in a particular order, or eating from a particular bowl or plate, or evenwearing a bib in a certain way. Be patient. The child is being exposed to a world of newthings. Food rituals can often help them to feel more secure. Let them follow their ritualuntil they decide to give it up.Child Has Food Likes and DislikesWe all have our food likes and dislikes. Children are no different. However, whileyou need to respect their likes and dislikes, you need also to recognize that children's foodpreferences are still developing . Many children will automatically dislike a new food.This does not mean you should assume they will never like it and therefore stop servingit. Wait a week or so and try the food again. You might also try preparing the food itemdifferently. If after many tries the child still chooses not to eat the food, respect the child'sdecision. Try substituting another food from the same food group. Let a few months passand then try again.Child Has Trouble Chewing or SwallowingIf child has trouble chewing or swallowing food it may mean that the child is notdevelopmentally ready to eat solid foods. Remember that not all children develop at thesame rate. Difficulty swallowing or chewing might also be an indication of a physicalproblem. Don' t ever force or bribe the child to eat. You could actually harm the child.Recommend that parents take the child to see a health care professional.A Child is Not Able to Hold Utensils or Cups The Way The Other Children CanAll children develop at their own pace. Developmental milestones are meant asgeneral guidelines, not as hard and fast rules. If you have a child who seems slower todevelop coordination and motor skills than the other children, do not call attention to thedelay. Praise that child for his or her individual accomplishments and efforts. This childmay catch up and eventually even surpass the other children developmentally. However,if you feel there is real cause for concern, suggest that the parents take the child to see ahealth care professional. Page 205 7 Mealtime in the Family Child Care Home Child Has a Food Allergy or Food IntoleranceFood allergies are relatively common among infants and young children.Symptoms of allergic reactions include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash,irritability, breathing problems, and even death. These reacdons may occur immediatelyafter the food is eaten or hours later. Foods that commonly cause allergic reactions includenuts, peanuts, eggs, cow's milk protein, wheat, fish, shellfish, and citrus fruits. To preventthe reaction, one must avoid eating the foods they are allergic to. If you have a child whois allergic to a food, the child's parent should provide you with written information froma health care provider aboutwhat the child can and can not eat. In most cases you cansubstitele another food item in that same food gioup of the food the child is allergic to.A food intolerance results from the absence of some chemical or enzyme neededto digest a particular food. A child with a food intolerance may suffer from abdominalpain, bloating, and diarrhea. Unlike food allergies, a child with a food intolerances doesnot necessarily have to avoid the food. Sometimes the food can be altered in such a waythat the child can digest it.The most common food intolerance results from the inability digest the sugar orlactose in milk. This is referred to as a lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance is verycommon among Africans, Black Americans, Asian Americans, Jews, Arabs, and NativeAmericans from both North and South America. Some children can not tolerate anyamount of lactose, while others can tolerate lactose in small amounts in foods spacedthroughout the day.Children who have lactose intolerance may have a difficult time getting thecalcium they need. As a result, the health care provider might suggest a milk substituteor additive. There is acommercial milk product on the market that has been modified sothat children with lactose intolerance can digest it. It is referred to as hydrolyzed milk.You can also purchase an additive which you can add to regular milk to make it digestibleto children with lactose intolerance. This additive is the enzyme lactase, sold over thecounter as Lact-aid. There are also lactose-free soy-based formulas which can be usedas substitutes for infantformula or cow's milk.As always, follow the health care providers recommendations regarding the dietsof children with food allergies, or lactose and other food intolerances. Do not try any ofthe alternatives listed above unless you have been instructed so by a health care provider.(From Healthy Young Children: A Manual For Programs, Abby Shapiro Kendrick, Roxane Kaufman,and Katherine P. Messenger (Editors), 1988, National Association for The Education of Young Children:Washington, D.C.)Child Eats Too Much or is OverweightOccasionally a parent will ask a provider to restrict the diet of their overweightchild. However, obesity could result from something other than the child's food intake.Research shows that in most cases obesity among children is related more to a lack ofphysical activity. Even if a child does overeat, overeating may be an indication of familyand/or emotional problems that you as a provider are not equipped to handle. Suggestto the parent that they consult a heal th care provider. Never restrict a child's food intakeunless instructed to by a health care provider. Instead, give children nutritiousfood choices and plenty of opportunities for physical exercise.Page 2158 Mealtime in the Family Child Care HomeSpecial Issue: What You Can Do When A Child Is Choking (Source: The American Red Cross.)If a child is choking but CAN BREATHE:Call the rescue squad (911) and until help comes:Keep the child calm.Have the child sit down and cough.Do not slap the child on the back.Do not give the child a drink.Do not hold the child upside down.If a child is choking but CANNOT BREATHE, COUGH,SPEAK, OR CRY, Call the rescue squad (911) and untilhelp comes:For an infant who is conscious: (see picture #1)1. Place the infant face down on your arm, supported by your thigh,and tilt the head towards the floor.2. Give 4 back blows between the shoulder blades with the heel ofyour hand.If the object does not come out: (see picture #2)3. Sandwich the infant between your forearms and hands, and turnthe infant on its back. Place your arm on your thigh for support,tilting the infant's head towards the floor.4. Place two fingers on the infant's chest one finger's width below animaginary line running between the infant's nipples. If you feel thenotch at the end of the ribs you are too low and should move yourfingers up slightly. Do not push on the lower stomach of aninfant.5. Press 4 times on infant's chest.6. Repeat if necessary.For a young child who is conscious: (see picture #3.)1. Lay the child on the floor on its bhck. Kneel at the child's feet.2. Place the heel of your hand on the child's stomach, just above thenavel and well below the rib cage. Do not press your fingers on thechild's ribs.3. Press rapidly in and up 6 to 10 times.4. Repeat if necessary.For an infant or young child who becomesunconscious:1. Open the mouth and look for the object. If you can see it, removeit by doing a finger sweep with your little finger.2. Give two slow breaths to the infant or young child.3. Repeat the steps given above for a conscious infant or young childif necessaryThe infant or young child needs to see a doctor, evenwhen breathing returns.Every provider should learn how to respond when.a child is choking.Call your local American Red Cross chapter for more informationand for first aid training.Page 2259 CHAPTER 2 UNDERSTANDINGTHEDIETARY GUIDELINES II 1Understanding the Dietary Guidelines In the introduction ou will read about:nutrition: one part of a healthy childhoodgood nutrition: not just for childrenthe dietary guidelinesthe food guide pyramidadult serving sizesChild and Adult Care Food Program food chart 1.Page 1This manual was made possible by an educational grant from Nestle USA, Inc. toSave The Children Child Care Support Center.page 2page 2page 3page 4page 6page 7 Understanding the Dietary GuidelinesNutrition: One Part of a HealthyChildhoodChildhood is a time of rapid growth anddevelopment. During this time children need lotsof nutrients. Nutrients include the vitamins,minerals, carbohydrates, protein, fat, andwater that we get from the foods we eat. Chil-dren also need to get the right amount of calories,the energy we get from the foods we eat. Butchildren can only eat so much. This makes it veryimportant that the food choices children receivebe healthy choices, choices that provide themwith all of the right nutrients and plenty of calo-ries.Good nutrition means eatingthe right amounts of the rightcombinations of healthyfoods.Here are some of the reasons why goodnutrition is important.1. Good nutrition helps children feel goodand look good.2. Good nutritionyes childrai the energyto grow, learn and play.3. Good nutrition prevents some diseasesand makes children more resistant toothers. Six out of the 10 major diseasesin the United States, such as heart dis-ease and high blood pressure, are dietrelated.4. Good nutrition helps to prevent dentalproblems.5. Good nutrition provides for the propergrowth and repair of body tissue.6. Healthy eating habits learned and prac-ticed in childhood can form the basis ofa lifetime of good health.The role of family child care providersin making sure children learn healthy eatinghabits and get the nutrition they need is per-haps more important now than ever before.Today most parents work outside the home. Theyoften find themselves too tired at the end of theday, and often in too big a hurry in the mornings,to prepare nutritious meals as they might like.Fast food chains and pre-packaged dinners, notalways the most nutritious foods, are easy to serveand often take the place of home cooked meals.Whether or not some childrenget enough of the nutritiousfoods they need may depend onwhat you offer them in the fam-ily child care home. Good Nutrition:Not Just For ChildrenAlthough the major focus of this trainingmaterial is on providing nutritious meals andsnacks for the children in your care, good nutri-tion is really for everyone. The information pro-vided in these chapters applies just as much to youand your family as it does to the children in yourcare. The information we present is based on thedietary guidelines issued by the United StatesDepartment of Agriculture and the UnitedStates Department of Health and Human Ser-vices.These dietary guidelines were actuallywritten for adults. However, we found that theycould also be used in developing general guide-lines for feeding children. In a few cases ourdietary recommendations for children aresomewhat different from the dietary guide-lines for adults. For example, children under twoneed more fat than older children and adults. Inthese cases we have been careful to note thedifferences.In explaining these dietary guidelines andteaching you how to apply them, we sometimesrefer to the way you eat and sometimes refer to thefoods you offer children.This is because we Page 262 understand that the two are related. We know thatmany of you serve the same foods to your familiesas you serve to the children in your care. Some ofyou cook large evening meals so that you haveenough left for the children's lunch the next day.Others may cook large lunches so that you haveenough for your family's evening meal. Even ifyou do cook different meals for your family thanyou serve to the children in your care, the way youcook is probably basically the same. In otherwords, if you often fry foods for your family, youprobably fry foods for the children. Similarly,when you shop, you are probably buying foryourself and your family, as well as for thechildren in your care. No doubt you have comeup with several ways to manage food shoppingand preparation that save you time and moneywhile providing meals and snacks for everyoneeating in your home.We hope that you will use the informa-tion we provide not only to prepare morenutritious meals and snacks for the children,but to prepare more nutritious meals andsnacks for yourself and your family. Goodnutrition is in everyone' s best interest.We Could All UseA Refresher Course In NutritionThere have been many changes recently inwhat we know about nutrition.We have discovered that many of the foodswe have eaten in the past are not that goodfor us and should not be eaten as often or insuch large quantities. For example, research-ers have found relationships between so-dium and hypertension, fat and heart dis-ease, and fat and cancer.We have discovered that some of thenutrients we get from foods have benefitsnot previously recognized. For example,fiber may reduce a person's risk of gettingsome forms of cancer, and adequate calciumin the diet may prevent osteoporosis.Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Often it is the way we prepare the food, andnot the food itself, that makes it a healthychoice or a not- so -healthy choice. As webecome introduced to new foods we learnnew recipes and new ways to prepare foods,including more healthy ways to preparesome of our old favorites.All of this may seem a little overwhelm-ing, but it is much simpler than it seems. Thechanges in what we should eat are summed up inthe following dietary guidelines developed by theUnited States Department of Agriculture and theUnited States Department of Health and HumanServices.1. Eat a variety of foods.2. Maintain a healthy weight.3. Choose a diet low in fat,saturated fat, and cholesterol.(This does NOT apply tochildren 2 years old oryounger. Read why onpage 41.)4. Choose a diet with plenty ofvegetables,fruits, and grainproducts so that you getadequate starch and fiber.5. Avoid too much sugar.6. Avoid too much salt andsodium.These dietary guidelines were used to constructthe Food Guide Pyramid presented on the follow-ing page. This Pyramid shows the relative amountsof food we need from each of the 5 food groups.It will be used throughout this chapter in explain-ing each of the dietary guidelines.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Human Nutrition Information Service,August 1992, Leaflet No. 57264BEST COPY AVAILABLE Reading The Food Guide PyramidThe smallest part of the pyramid is the tip.This area is labelled \"fats, oils, sweets.\" Eatthese foods sparingly.They are mostlycalories and have very little real nutritionalvalue.The second level of the pyramid is dividedinto two parts. On the left side are dairyproducts like milk, yogurt, and cheese. Eat2-3 servings from this group each day. Onthe right side of the second level is themeats, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs andnuts food group. Eat 2-3 servings from thisgroup each day. Level 3 of the pyramid is also divided intotwo parts. The left side which representsvegetables is a little larger than the rightside, the side representing fruits. Eat 3-5servings of vegetables and 2-4 servings offruit each day.The bottom level of the pyramid is thelargest and shows the food group that shouldprovide us with the biggest portion of ourdaily diet. This group is the grain products:bread, pasta, cereal, and rice. We should eat6-11 servings from this group each day.Understanding the Dietary Guidelines About Serving SizeThe USDA suggests that everyone eat atleast the smaller number of servings recommendedfor each of the food groups in the food pyramid.Adult serving sizes for each of the food groups isprovided on page 6. Use this as a guide for healthyeating for adults.Children need the same variety in theirdiets, but because children are smaller they mayneed smaller servings. They make up for thesmaller serving in part by eating more often thanadults. Remember, snacks are an important com-ponent in a child's diet. Without snacks, childrenmay not get all of the calories and nutrients theyneed.Use the Child and Adult Care Food Pro-gram Food Chart on page 7 to help you determineserving sizes for children. These are the mini-mum amounts that the Child and Adult CareFoodProgram requires you to offer children. Youprobably know better than anyone that while youmay encourage a child to eat, the decision to eator not to eat is ultimately made by the child. Inaddition, not only do different children eat differ-ent amounts, but each child will have times whenhe or she seems to eat a lot, and times when he orshe seems to eat only a little. Use serving sizesand the food pyramid as general guidelines forhealthy eating. 6 5Page 5 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Adult Size Servings For The 5 Food GroupsBread, Cereal, Rice, and Pastaone adult size serving =1 slice of breador1 ounce of ready-to-eat cerealor1/2 cup of cooked cereal, rice, or pastaVegetableone adult size serving =1 cup of raw leafy vegetablesOr1/2 cup of other vegetables, cooked orchopped rawor3/4 cup of vegetable juiceFruitone adult size serving =1 medium apple, banana, orangeOr1/2 cup of chopped, cooked, or canned fruitor3/4 cup of fruit juiceMilk, Yogurt, and Cheeseone adult size serving =1 cup of milk or yogurt(Remember: These are adult serving sizes.Children need 2 cups of milk a day.)or1-1/2 ounces of natural cheeseor2 ounces of processed cheeseMeat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans,Eggs, and Nutsone adult size serving =2-3 ounces of cooked lean meat,poultry, or fish.(1/2 cup of cooked dry beans, 1 large egg,or 2 tablespoons of peanut buttercount as 1 ounce of meat. ) 6 6Page 6 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Child Care Food Program Food ChartAgeAgeAge1 and 23 through 5 6 throughl2BreakfastFluid milkJuice or Ft tit or VegetableBread or Bread AlternateSnack(Supplement.

In order to get all of the nutrients our bodiesneed, we need variety in the foods we eat over a several dayperiod. Our bodies need about 50 different nutri-ents to stay healthy. Ten of these nutrients havebeen identified as key nutrients. This means thatif we eat the foods that supply us with enough ofthese 10 nutrients, we can be fairly certain that wehave enough of the other 40.The 10 key nutrients are:CalciumCarbohydratesFatIronNiacinProteinVitamin AVitamin B1 (Thiamin)Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)Vitamin CWe caget enough of these nutrients byeating a variety of foods. Selecting foods fromeach of the 5 major food groups will assure us weare getting a variety. These5 major food groupsare:1. Fruits: Fruits are a good source of vitaminA,vitamin C, potassium and dietary fiber.2. Vegetables: These foods provide us withvitamins A and C, minerals like iron andmagnesium and dietary fiber.3. Breads, cereals, rice, pastas and otherfoods made from grains: This food groupprovides protein, iron, vitamin B1 andniacin. It is also a good source of complexcarbohydrates which supply us with en-ergy.4. Milk, yogurt and cheese: These foods areour best sources of calcium.They alsoprovide vitamin B2, protein, fat, and othernutrients. Vitamins A and D are added tosome brands of milk. These brands arelabeled \"fortified.\" Because of these ex-tra vitamins, fortified milk is the best tobuy. All children being served by theUSDA Child and Adult Care Food Pro-gram must have fluid milk every day.Yogurt and cheese cannot be served inplace of milk. 5.Dry beans and dry peas, eggs, fish,poultry, and meat: These foods are ourmajor source of protein. They also con-tain vitamin Bl, fat, niacin and iron. Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Some foods are better sources of certainnutrients than others, and not all of the foods inone food group contain the exact same nutrients.So, for example, we cannot just rely on a coupleof different vegetables to provide us with themany nutrients we need from vegetables. Weneed variety. For example, if you served corn asa vegetable on Monday, serve squash on Tuesdayand spinach on Wednesday. Try to serve a newvegetable each day for 2 weeks. Can you do it?The children will probably have theirfavorite foods from each food group, and you mayfeel tempted to serve these favorites over and overto please them. But this is not the best way toprovide for their nutritional needs. It also robschildren of the opportunity to try new foods andexperience new tastes and textures. Remember, achild can dislike a food one week, but like it thenext. And they can dislike it cooked one way, butlike it cooked another. Refer back to the sectionon Introducing New Foods in Chapter 1 of thismanual for information on getting children to trynew foods.Eating a variety of foods may be themost important of the dietary guidelines. Ifyour meals reflect the eating pattern illus-trated in the Food Guide Pyramid, if you areoffering the right amounts of a variety of foods,you will have little problem meeting the other5 dietary guidelines.

Understanding the Dietary Guidelines The 10 Key NutrientsSupporting InformationFor The Provider Who Wants To Know More CARBOHYDRATES:Carbohydrates are our major sources ofenergy.Carbohydrates are supplied by foods inthree forms. These are starches, sugars,and cellulose or fiber.Starch (complexcarbohydrates) and sugars (simple carbo-hydrates) provide energy and support ac-tivity and growth. Cellulose or fiber fur-nishes bulk.(Dietary Guideline #4 ad-dresses the body's need for adequate fiber.For more information about fiber, see thePrimary Information on page 63.)The major portion of our diet should comefrom foods that provide us with complexcarbohydrates. Children especially needthe calories (energy) from complex carbo-hydrates when the fat in their diet is lim-ited.Some of the major sources of carbohy-drates are potatoes, grains, breads, cereals,rice, pastas, vegetables, and fruits.PROTEIN:Protein is necessary to life and growth.Protein helps to build and repair all bodytissues like skin, bone, hair, blood andmuscle.Although lack of protein can cause serioushealth problems, this is very uncommon inthe United States.Most Americans getmore protein than they really need. Page 17Proteins are made up of building blockscalled amino acids. Nine of these aminoacids, such as lysine and tryptophan, areessential for human beings and cannot bemade by the body. We can only get themthrough the foods we eat.Proteins come from two major sources:1. animal proteins: meat, fish, eggs, milkand cheese.2. plant proteins: cereal, pasta, grain,breads, dry peas and dry beans.Proteins vary in quality based on the numberand balance of the amino acids. In order forour body to fully use the protein, all 9 of theessential amino acids must be present inbalanced proportions.Animal proteins contain all of the essentialamino acids that make up protein. They areconsidered the highest quality protein. Yourbody can use them easier and get more fromthem than it can from plant proteins.Plant proteins do not contain all of the aminoacids, the building blocks that make upprotein. They are incomplete proteins un-less they are combined in specific ways withother sources of plant proteins. For ex-ample, by combining peanut butter andbread, or beans and corn tortillas, you havea complete plant protein.(You can readmore about combining foods in the Support-ing Information on page 23.) 75 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines In addition to protein, meats can be high infat. Therefore, it important to learn how tocombine plant proteins, like dry beans andgrains, to create complete proteins and toserve these occasionally as low fat substi-tutes for meat protein.FATS:Fats are our most concentrated sources ofenergy. Remember, in the nutrition field,energy means calories.There are morecalories in fat than in the same amount ofany other source of nutrients. In fact, fatshave more than twice the calories, ounce forounce, as proteins, starches, or sugars. Theyalso take longer to digest, and give you that\"full\" feeling.Fats are vital nutrients. They are involvedin the building of body tissues and supportvital organs, such as the kidneys. Children,especially children under two, need morefat in their diets than adults.Fats are composed of fatty acids. There arethree kinds of fatty acids; polyunsaturated,monounsaturated, and saturated. Vegetablefats, such as corn, cottonseed, safflower,sunflower seed, sesame seed and soybeanoils are generally high in polyunsaturatedfatty acids. Olive oil and peanut oil are richin monounsaturated fatty acids. Animalproducts and coconut oil, cocoa butter, and macadamia nuts are high in satu-rated fatty acids.Diets high in saturated fatty acids have beenlinked to high cholesterol levels, a majorfactor in coronary heart disease and otherchronic diseases. (The section on DietaryGuideline # 3 beginning on page 39 pro-vides information on lowering cholesterol.)VITAMIN A:Vitamin A, also called retinol, is importantfor normal growth, for night vision, and infighting infection.Good sources of vitamin A are dark greenand deep yellow vegetables including bokchoy, broccoli, carrots, greens and spinach,as well as sweet potatoes, tomatoes, peaches,watermelon, mango, and papaya.Vitamins A and C are the two vitamins mostoften lacking in American children's diets.You should choose at least one serving fromhigh vitamin A foods every other day.Because excess vitamin A is toxic, vitaminA supplements may be dangerous. It is bestto get your vitamin A from the foods youeat. Excess vitamin A will not be a concernif you eat a variety of foods.VITAMIN C:Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, helpsin building and repairing tissue, in keepingthe body resistant to infection and in healingwounds. It also helps the body to make useof iron. (To learn more about this, see page24.) Page 18Good sources of vitamin C are CitIlls fruitsand most dark green vegetables. Aspara-gus, strawberries are excel-lent sources.Vitamin C cannot be stored in the body andneeds to be eaten every day. 7 6 VITAMIN Bl:Vitamin Bl, also called thiamin, helps usget energy from carbohydrates, promotes anormal appetite, and is important for ahealthy nervous system.Whole grain or fortified cereals, liver, leanpork, yeast (used in making bread), rawnuts, and lentils are good sources of vitaminBl.VITAMIN B2:Vitamin B2, also called riboflavin, helps usutilize energy and is important for healthyskin, eyes, and clear vision.mu and dairy products, liver, and greenleafy vegetables are all good sOurces ofvitamin B2.NIACIN:Niacin helps us utilize energy, and promoteshealthy skin and nerves and a normal appe-tite. It also helps us with digestion.Whole grain or fortified cereals, peanuts,poultry, fish, liver, and meats are goodsources of niacin.CALCIUM:Calcium is vital to healthy bones and teeth.It also helps with blood clotting, musclecontraction and relaxation, and the func-tioning of nerves.Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Milk is the major source of calcium in theAmerican diet.Cheese and other dairy products, lentils,beans, sardines, dried fruits, collards, kale,mustard and turnip greens are also goodsources of calcium.At certain times in our lives our bodies needextra calcium. Children, teenagers, preg-nant women, nursing mothers, and olderpersons have a greater need for calcium.MON:Iron is necessary for healthy blood. It aidsin the use of energy and increases our resis-tance to infection. Page 19Iron-fortified cereals, prune juice, liver, drybeans and dry peas,some vegetables and redmeat are good sources of iron.Lack of an adequate supply of iron leads toailemia (weak blood) and fatigue. (You canread more about this in the Primary Infor-mation on the next page.)Iron is especially important to young chil-dren and women.Iron deficiency is the single most commonnutritional problem among infants andpreschoolers. 7 7 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines 1Iron Deficiency AnemiaSupporting InformationFor The Provider Who Wants To Know More Iron deficiency anemia is the most com-mon nutritional problem among infants andpreschoolers, especially for those living in pov-erty.Children who are suffering from irondeficiency are often pale, listless, and irritable.They often have little energy or appetite and havefrequent colds. There are two major causes ofiron deficiency.1. Failure to eat enough iron-rich foods.Iron-rich foods include red meats, fish,poultry, leafy green vegetables like spin-ach and mustard greens, raisins and prunes,iron-rich breads and cereals, dry beans anddry peas, and egg yolks. Some children fillup on extra servings of milk and then havelittle appetite for these iron rich foods.Make sure the young children in your careare not filling up on extra servings of millcand select iron-rich snacks to supplementthe iron they get from meals.2. Failure of the body to absorb the iron.Iron is one of the most difficult of allnutrients for the body to absorb. Iron frommeat sources is easier to absorb than ironfrom non-meat sources.However, you can increase the body'sability to use iron from non-meat sources byserving certain combinations of foods. In particu-lar, foods high in vitamin C increase the body'sabsorption of iron. For example, serve a glassof orange juice (source of vitamin C) with ironfortified cereal (non-meat source of iron .) Youcan also increase the iron content of foods bycooking them in a cast iron skillet or pan.See the Supporting Information on page23 for more information on combining foods.Other foods can decrease the body's abil-ity to absorb iron.In particular, foods andbeverages containing caffeine decrease thebody's ability to absorb iron. Drinks containingcaffeine, like tea and soft drinks, are not recom-mended for children. However, if you choose todrink beverages with caffeine and want to get themaximum use of the iron in your diet, do notconsume caffeine during the meal or up to onehour after the meal.NOTE: If you are enrolled in the Child and AdultCare Food Program, it is possible for you to meetthe minimum requirements for foods offered andportion sizes, and still not provide children withadequate iron. The USDA is currently updatingthe requirements and intends to address this issue.Until then, make an effort to exceed the Child andAdult Care Food Program requirements by offer-ing foods high in iron and encouraging extraservings. 78Page 21 Understanding the Dietary GuidelinesIron Content of Selected Foods(A child between the ages of 1 and 6 needs 10 mg. of iron a day.)FoodAmountIron (mg.)Breads and cereals:Enriched or wholegra; ; breads etc. 1/2 cup0.7Iron-enriched cookedor dry cereals1/2-3/4 cup0.7Multi-vitamin and iron supplement cereals .

Here are two examples.1. Combining Foods To CompleteProteinsProteins from plant sources, like driedbeans and peanut butter, are not really completeby themselves. Incomplete proteins do not meetour body's need for protein.In order to makethese proteins complete, these foods need to beserved with other foods.The following combinations of foods cre-ate complete proteins.Beans Served With GrainsExamples include:beans and cornbreadbeans and tortillasbeans and ricepea soup and cornbreadbaked beans and whole wheat biscuitsInformationo Wants To Know More Cheese Or Eggs Served With BeansExamples include:pinto beans and cheesebeans and eggsEggs Or Cheese Or Milk Served With GrainsExamples include:grilled cheese or egg sandwich on wholewheat breadspaghetti or other pasta and cheeseoatmeal and milktoast and eggsrice pudding (contains rice, milk, andeggs)Cheese Or Eggs Served With Dark GreenVegetablesExamples include:broccoli and cheese saucespinach souffle (contains spinach and eggs) Page 23SO Understanding the Dietary Guidelines 2. Combining Foods To Make IronUseableSome vitamins and minerals work bestwith other vitamins and minerals. For example,although grains, cereals, and dried beans and peasand some vegetables contain iron, the iron is notin a form our bodies can easily use. But, if youserve these foods with a food high in vitamin C,the iron becomes usable.The list on the left contains foods whichare non-meat sources of iron.

Keep in mind that cooking destroysalmost all of the vitamin C in food. Therefore,the amount of vitamin C these foods providewill be affected by if you cook them and howyou cook them. For example, the cabbage in coleslaw is a better source of vitamin C than steamedcabbage. The foods on the list which can beserved raw, and therefore may be considered thebest sources of vitamin C, are in bold print. Usethese lists to help you develop menus whichcombine foods to take advantage of iron fromnon-meat sources. Guidelines Special Issue: Are Vitamin Supplements Necessary? Most experts seem to agree that children seldom need vitamin supplementsif they are offered a variety of foods. Children's nutritional needs do vary at differentstages of growth. For example, children under two need more fat than children older thantwo. However, these needs can usually be met through the foods they consume. Thereare a few exceptions, but these are better left to the determination of a health careprovider.If you have a child who eats poorly on a regular basis, discuss the matter with thechild' s parent(s). There are many different reasons why a child might eat poorly. A poorappetite ccould be a sign of illness or could be the result of emotional turmoil. Refusalto eat could also be an indication of a physical problem. Eating might cause the childdiscomfort or pain. If a parent reports that the child eats poorly at home as well, you mightsuggest that they consult their health care provider to determine why the child eats poorly.The health care provider will determine whether or not a vitamin supplement isappropriate for the child.Never give a child a vitamin supplement unless it has been prescribed by ahealth care provider. It is best for you to use your energy in providing good foodchoices. Not only are vitamin supplements rarely needed, but high dosages of somevitamins can be dangerous.Although most adults do not need vitamin supplements, there are someexceptions. These are:Women in their childbearing years may need to take iron supplementsto replace the iron lost through menstrual bleeding.Women who are pregnant or who are breast feeding need more ofnany nutrients. They should consult a health care provider for informa-tion about the right vitamin supplement.Elderly people who eat relatively little food or are on certainmedications may need to take supplements on the advice of their healthcare provider. Understanding the Dietary Guidelines S ecial Issue: \"Fortified\" Foods What is meant by \"fortified foods?\"\"Fortified foods\" are food products that have certain nutrients added tothem during production. In some cases, food products are \"fortified\" in order to replacenutrients that were removed during processing. For example, refined grain products areput through a milling process that partially removes many of the vitamins and minerals.When some of these vitamins and minerals are put back into the product duringproduction, the pi Oducts are labelled \"fortified.\"In other cases, food products are fortified with vitamins that were not present inthe foods originally. Milk is a good example. Vitamins A & D are not found naturallyin milk. But because of the body's need for these nutrients, and the difficulty some peoplehave in getting the required amount, the daisy industry has adopted the policy of addingthem to milk. Some milk cartons will say \"fortified with Vitamins A & D.\" Others maysay \"Vitamin A + D Milk.\" Other may simply include vitamins A & D in the list ofingredients.If we eat fortified grain products, do we still need to include less refined or wholegrain products in our diets?Yes. Even though you may eat fortified grain products, you still need to eat someless refined or whole grain products. There are 2 major reasons for including less refinedor whole grain products in your diet.1. Fortifying refined products replaces some of the vitamin and minerals lost duringprocessing, and in some cases may add more of a nutrient than was present in theoriginal food. However, even in \"fortifying\" the product, it is unlikely that all ofthe different vi*amins and minerals taken out have been replaced.2. Whole grain products supply the body with dietary fiber. Dietary fiber is importantin promoting normal bowel functioning and in preventing and treating constipation.Recent scientific studies suggest that fiber ma4 play a role in preventing colon cancerand reducing cholesterol. (You will learn more about the importance of dietary fiberand how to increase your consumption in the section on dietary guideline #4.) R3Page 26 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Special Issue: Vegetarian Diets Vegetarianism is a widespread practice. In fact, a large part of the world'spopulation subsists on vegetarian diets. In many parts of the world traditional religiousand cultural beliefs promote a vegetarian diet. Vegetarianism has been practiced inAmerican society among a small proportion of the population for a long time. Onlywithin the second half of this century has there been an increase in the popularity ofvegetarianism in the United States.According to the National Academy of Sciences' Food and Nutrition Board,adults who are vegetarians can be well nourished if they select their diets carefullyand give attention to nutrients that may be lacking in vegetarian diets. However,there are studies that report nutrient deficiencies of certain vegetarian diets,especially among infants and young children. In addition, adverse health effect fromstrict and unplanned vegetarian diets have been reported. For these reasons, it isimportant that vegetarians understand the principles necessary to practice safe andhealthy vegetarianism.Types of Vegetarian DietsA vegetarian is a person who does not eat some or any foods of animal origin.A vegetarian primarily eats foods that come from plants. Such foods include grains,legumes, fruits and vegetables. Vegetarians have different dietary practices, but mostcan be categorized into one of the following groups.Semi-vegetarians eat plant foods, milk, mild products, eggs, and more or lesslimited amounts of seafood and poultry. Red meat usually is avoided.Pesco-vegetarians eat plant foods and fish but exclude red meats.Po llo-vegetarians eat plant foods and poultry but exclude red meats.Lacto-ovo-vegetarians eat plant foods, milk, milk products, but avoid eggs andflesh foods.0 vo-vegetarians eat plant foods and eggs, but avoid milk, milk products and fleshfoods.Total vegetarians, also called vegans, eat plant foods only. No foods of animalorigin are consumed. Page 278 4 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Why People Become VegetariansAmericans become vegetarians for a variety of reasons. People generally adoptvegetarian diets for one or more of the following reasons:Health. Many people believe they will be healthier if they are vegetarians. Vegetariandiets tend to be lower in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium than the typicalAmerican diet.Some studies have found that in some people these dietarycharacteristics are associated with reduced risk of heart disease and high bloodpressure. Vegetarian diets tend to be high in fiber. Fiber is beneficial in the dietbecause it rapidly moves food through the intestinal tract. Hence, there may be lesstime for carcinogens (cancer-causing substances) to be absorbed into the body.However, the National Academy of Sciences reports that the caner/fiber link appearsdoubtful at this time.Though there are positive health benefits of vegetarianism, studies have shownthat vegetarians are not necessarily more healthy or less healthy than meat-eaters.Vegetarianism cannot prevent or cure disease and vegetarians should continue toseek necessary medical care.Ecology. Individuals who turn to vegetarianism for ecological reasons feel that one wayto combat world hunger is to eat lower on the food chain. These vegetarians feel thepractice of growing food to feed animals is wasteKr Instead, many more peoplecould be fed if crops were used to feed people rather than animals.Economics. Economic reasons for vegetarianism focus on the fact that it generally isless expensive not to eat meat. It has been estimated that the cost of meat accountfor about one-third of the average food bill. Most plant foods are cheaper than animalfoods. The expense of eating meat may limit the amount people eat. Ethics. Ethical reasons for vegetarianism include philosophies such as nonviolence andreverence for life. Some people are opposed to killing animals for food. Thus, theyabstain from eating meat, poultry and fish.Religion. Some religious groups have traditionally been vegetarian. Several Indianreligious groups include vegetarianism among their tenets of faith. In the UnitedStates Seventh Day Adventists are the largest traditional group following vegetari-anism. Followers of this faith generally are lacto-ovo-vegetarians. Some vegetar-ians are members of new religious groups with diet-related taboos. Though thesegroups vary in beliefs and dietary habits, they tend to believe vegetarianism is a wayof cleansing the body and promoting a proper spiritual balance. Page 28R5 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Planning a Nutritious Vegetarian DietIndividuals consuming vegetarian diets generally receive adequate amounts ofmost nutrients. The nutrients that may be low in vegetarian diets and that require specialattention are protein, calories, riboflavin, vitamins B-12 and D, calcium and iron. Protein is needed for growth and maintenance of body tissues. Protein also is necessaryfor enzymes, hormones, antibodies and milk production in women who are breastfeeding. Protein is required throughout life. Each day protein must be supplied bythe foods people eat.Animal and plant foods supply protein, but the protein in plant foods is of a lowerquality. Protein quality refers to the amino acid composition of a food. Amino acidsare the building blocks thatmake up all proteins. The body needs a total of 20 aminoacids to make protein. Twelve of the amino acids are non-essential amino acids.That is, the body can make these amino acids if they are not present in the foods aperson eats. The other amino acids are essential. The body cannot make these aminoacids., they must be obtained from food.Animal foods, such as milk and meat, are complete proteins. This means theycontain all nine of the indispensable amino acids needed for growth and good health.A person who eats foods of animal origin on a daily basis gets all of the indispensableamino acids. Plant foods, such as grains and legumes, are incomplete proteins.These foods lack one or more of the indispensable amino ;acids. For example, grainsdo not have enough of the amino acid lysine, and legumes lack methionine.Therefore, a vegan who relies only on plant foods for protein may not receive all ofthe indispensable amino acids.A vegan can get all of the essential amino acids in one of two ways. First, twosources of plant protein, when eaten together, may supply all of the indispensableamino acids. This is called protein complementation. The following chart demon-strates how plant foods can be eaten in combination to supply all of the essentialamino acids. 2Ab Understanding the Dietary Guidelines For example, when a peanut butter sandwich is eaten the bread supplies moreof the tnethionine which the peanut butter is low in and the peanut butter suppliesthe lysine which the bread is low in. Some other complementary combinations are:rice-bean casserolecorn tortillas and beanspea soup and rye breadbaked beans and brown breadgarbanzo beans and riceblack-eyed peas and ricepeanut butter on crackerslentil and rice soupsunflower seeds and peanutssesame seeds in bean casserolebean burritos The second way a vegan can get all of the essential amino acids is to use texturedvegetable protein (TVP) and meat analogues. TVP is made from soybeans and isfortified with amino acids so it contains all of the essential amino acids. TVP is soldin a dehydrated form and must be reconstituted with water. TVP is used primarilyin casseroles.Meat analogues are meat-like foods made from vegetable protein, usuallysoybeans. Like TVP, meat analogues are fortified with amino acids so they arecomplete proteins. Meat analogues are purchased either canned or frozen and comein a variety of flavors, such as beef, chicken and bacon.Energy is needed to sustain all body processes and also is needed for physical activity.The energy in food is measured in units called calories. Calories are supplied by fat,carbohydrate and protein in food. Vegetarians tend to consume fewer calories andto be thinner than meat eaters. This is because vegetarians eat plant foods that arebulky and low in calories.Most vegetarians do not have difficulty in eating enough food to meet theirenergy needs. Children also will receive enough calories if they drink milk, eat milkproducts and eggs on a daily basis. However, because infants, young children andpregnant and lactating women have high needs for calories they may have difficultyconsuming enough energy on a vegan diet. Protein also is a potential problem forthese special groups. For this reason vegan diets are not recommended for thesegroups unless the diets are carefully planned and supervised by a registered dietitianor other qualified health professional.Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) helps the body break down carbohydrates, proteins and fatsso that they can be used for energy. Riboflavin also is necessary for healthy skin,eyes and clear vision. The best sources of riboflavin are liver, milk products and redmeats. When these foods are restricted or avoided in the diet, riboflavin must comefrom such other sources as green leafy vegetables and fortified or enriched grains. Page 30 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Vitamin B-12 is needed for normal red blood cell formation and normal nerve function.This vitamin is needed in the body in very small amounts and can be stored in thebody in large amounts. Therefore, a deficiency of vitamin B-12 takes a long timeto develop, maybe several years. Once a deficiency of the vitamin does develop, itresults in irreversible nerve damage. Therefore, vegetarians need to give specialattention to this nutrient.At this time it is believed that vitamin B-12 is found only in animal foods. Foodsof plant origin are not thought to contain any vitamin B-12. There are only threeexceptions.Three different groups of foods may provide varying amounts ofvitamin B-12. These are:fermented soybean products, suet, as tempeh, miso and natio.single cell proteins, such as microalgae and yeasts that are grown in amedium rich in vitamin B-12.sea vegetables, such as kelp, dulse, kombu and arame.It is essential to remember that it is not known how mh vitamin B-12 thesefoods contain. It may be a very small and insignificant amodnt. Therefore, thesefoods should not be relied upon for a single source of vitamin B-12.Vegetarians who eat milk products and eggs on a daily basis will consumeadequate amounts of vitamin B-12 in their diets. Vegans, however, will have littleor no vitamin B-12 in their diets. They must obtain the vitamin through regular useof vitamin B-12 fortified soy milk or yeast or a vitamin B-12 supplement. Vitamin D is required for the absorption of calcium from the digestive tract and for theincorporation of calcium into bones and teeth. Very few foods contain large amountsof vitamin D. The best sources -- fortified milk, egg yokes and liver -- are all ofanimal origin. Therefore, vegetarians, especially vegans, may not consume enoughvitamin D.A second source of vitamin D is sunlight. Sunlight on the skin enables the bodyto make vitamin D. A pefson who is regularly exposed to sunlight can get enoughvitamin D without having any come from food. However, exposure to sunlight canbe limited by several factors. Dark skin, pollution and northerly climates maydecrease sunlight exposure and, therefore, vitamin D production. It is recommendedthat when exposure to sunlight is limited and a diet is devoid of animal products, thata vitamin D supplement betaken.Calcium plays several roles in the body. It is needed for strong bones and teeth and fornormal blood clotting. Calcium also is needed for normal muscle and nerve function.Most calcium in the American diet comes from milk and milk products. When thesefoods are avoided in the diet, calcium must come from other sources. Dark green Page 318 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines leafy vegetables are the plant foods that provide the most calcium. It is often moredifficult for people to eat dark green vegetables in sufficient quantities on a dailybasis to meet the calcium needs. Careful menu planning becomes essential.Iron combines with protein to form hemoglobin, the substance in the blood that carriesoxygen and carbon dioxide. An adequate intake of iron is necessary to preventanemia. Many Americans, both meat-eaters and vegetarians, have a difficult timeconsuming enough iron. Iron is found in animal and plant foods, however, the ironin animal foods is more easily absorbed by the body. Also, the iron in plant foodsmay be less available to the body because of the high fiber content of plant foods.Fiber is not absorbed into the body. It may tie up minerals, such as iron and they toowill not be absorbed. For these reasons vegetarians may be at a higher risk fordeveloping iron deficiency.Because women need more iron than men, theyespecially need to give special attention to consuming adequate iron.Dark green leafy vegetables have the highest iron content. Dried fruits, such asraisins, apricots, peaches and prunes, also are high in iron. It is recommended thata food high in vitamin C (brussel sprouts, strawberries, citrus fruits, broccoli, collardgreens, mustard greens, cantaloupe) and a food high in iron be eaten at the same meal.Vitamin C increases the availability of iron in the intestinal tract. When vitamin Cand iron are eaten together, more iron is absorbed into the body.Zen MacrobioticsThe vegetarians generating the most concern among health professionals are theZen Macrobiotics. Members of macrobiotic groups eat diets based on a philosophy withorigins in the late 19th century. The macrobiotic diet consists of 10 dietary regimens.In the progression from lower to higher regimens, foods are eliminated from the diet.At the highest level only brown rice is eaten. This diet is claimed to help individualsachieve a state of well-being and to prevent all diseases known to humans.The American Medical Association's Council on Foods and Nutrition hasemphasized that the higher macrobiotic dietary regimens are extremely dangerous.Individual who follow the more rigid of the macrobiotic diets are in danger of developingsevere nutrient deficiencies. Cases of scurvy, anemia, starvation and loss of kidneyfunction have been reported, some have resulted in death.Using LegumesVegetarians, as well as meat-eaters, will find that legumes are an excellent foodto either extend or replace meat. Legumes are low in cost and high in nutritive value.They contribute iron and B vitamins to the diet. Although the protein quality of legumesis low, they can be combined with small amounts of animal food, such as milk, eggs orcheese, or with other plant foods to yield high quality proteins.1111 Page 3289 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines The term legumes refers to dry beans, dry peas and lentils. Legumes usually arefound on grocery store shelves in a plastic bag. Look for legumes that are uniform insize and bright in color. Legumes can be stored for six to eight months. Keep them inthe original package. Once opened, store them in a tightly covered container in a cool,dry place.Dry beans are rich in iron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. Many varietiesof dry beanse available, including blackbeans, garbanzo beans (also called chickpeas), kidney beans, lima beans, navy beans aid pinto beans. Unless the beans are slow-cooked all day, they should be soaked before cooking. Soaking reduces cooking timeand makes beans more tender. Beans can be soaked overnight or brought to a boil forthree minutes, removed from heat, covered, and soaked one to four hours. For each cupof beans use two to three cups of water. Test for doneness by piercing with a knife.Cooked beans can be used in many recipes.Dry peas are good sources of protein, iron, potassium and thiamin. Dry peas aregreen or yellow and can be purchased split of whole. Whole peas are prepared similarto beans, as described above. Split peas may be soaked for a shorter period of time.Lentils are disc-shaped legumes similar in size to peas. Lentils are rich inprotein, iron, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus. Lentils do not need to be pre-soakedand they cook faster than beans and whole peas.SummaryA vegetarian diet can meet daily nutrient needs. Vegetarians need to know whichnutrients may be lacking in a vegetarian diet. The fewer animal foods eater, the greaterthe likelihood of nutrient deficiency. Vegetarians need to give special attention toobtaining enough riboflavin, vitamin B-12, vitamin D., calcium and iron. Totalvegetarians or vegans, need to regularly eat vitamin B-12 fortified foods or take avitamin B-12 supplement.In addition, if exposure to sunlight is limited, a vitamin D supplement alsois recommended. To consume high quality protein, vegans need to practice proteincomplementation. Lastly, because it may be difficult for infants, young childrenand pregnant and lactating women to get enough calories, vegan diets are notrecommended for these groups unless the diet is planned and supervised by aqualified health professional.

Page 339 0 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines In this section you will learn about: promoting healthy eating and exercise habits 91Page 35page 37 uoUnderstanding the Dietary Guidelines PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know In applying this dietary requirement tochildren it might be better to say \"promote eatingand exercise habits that will assist the childthroughout his or her life in maintaining adesirable weight.\"The concern for a child's weight can beeither a concern that they weigh too little or aconcern that they weigh too much. The appendixcontains the normal growth charts for boys andgirls. You will notice that there is much variationin what is considered \"normal\" growth. Remem-ber, if a child is on the low end of the normal range,or the high end of the normal range, they are stillnormal. Any place within the normal range is justas good as any other.You are probably more likely to en-counter a parent who is overreacting to achild's weight, than a child whose health isthreatened by being overweight or under-weight. However, if you feel you have a child inyour care who falls in either of these categories,suggest that the parent(s) seek the advice of ahealth care provider.The Child That Weighs Too Little:The child that weighs too little may sufferfrom a failure to thrive. This can be very serious.Do not try to force feed the child. This canactually make the child eat less. Suggest that theparents consult a health care professional.The Child That Weighs Too Much:Overweight children do not necessarilybecome overweight adults. The vast majority ofchildren with weight problems naturally becomemore slender as they grow older. Children are ina phase of rapid growth and development. Theirneed for calories and nutritionally sound mealsand snacks is crucial. Restricting their diet in aneffort to c'ntrol their weight can be much moreharmful to them than being overweight. Neverput a child on a restrictive diet unless you areinstructed to do so by a health care profes-sional.In meeting this dietary requirement, yourresponsibility as a family child care provider is topromote a positive feeding relationship withthe children in your care , provide them withhealthy food choices, and encourage them toexercise. This will help them to form healthyhabits, increasing the odds that they will maintaina desirable weight throughout their lives. Learn-ing these good habits when they are young ismuch easier for them than restricting their diets orchanging bad habits when they are older.(For more information about your role in assist-ing children informing healthy habits, see Chap-ter 1 , Mealtime in the Family Day Care Home .)Remember: If you are concerned about theweight of a child in your care, suggest to. theparents that they consult a health care profes-sional. Page 3T)2 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines AAltAA AAlmkS. This does not apply to children under two years old.Children under two years old have a greater need for fat in theirdiets. Reducing their fat intake could be harmful. In this section you will learn about:limiting fat and cholesterol I page 41reading food labels for fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol contentpage 51 Helpful charts are provided on the fat and cholesterol contents of:dairy foodsbeef, pork and lambpoultry and 50 the supporting information:calculating fat consumption 1page 57 Pag4,33 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines - PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know As you know from the earlier discussionof nutrients, fat is one of the essential nutrients. Itis our most concentrated source of energy. Weneed fat to build body tissue and to support organssuch as the kidneys. The problem is that mostAmericans eat too much fat.Limiting Fat For Healthy AdultsThe American Heart Association recom-mends that healthy adults reduce their fat intake tono more than 30% of their calories. Saturated fatshould make up no more than 10% of calories,monounsaturated fat should make up no morethan 10% of calories, and polyunsaturated fatshould make up no more than 10% of calories.Cholesterol intake should be limited to no morethan 300 milligrams per day.Do Not Limit Fat For Children Under TwoChildren under two need more fat in theirdiets than older children and adults. At this agethey are growing and developing rapidly bothmentally and physically. They need the caloriesthat high fat foods provide. Do not reduce their fatintake. You can begin to reduce the fat in children'sdiets after the age of two.A Warning About Limiting Fat in the Diets ofChildren Over TwoWhen we limit fat, we limit calories. Thisis seldom a problem for adults, but it can robchildren of the calories they need to grow anddevelop properly.Because children need somany calories, we need to make sure that wemake up for the calorie loss due to reducing fatby offering them more of other foods and byoffering them food many times during the day.The best foods to offer them in place of thosefoods high in fats, are those foods high incomplex carbohydrates such as potatoes, grains,breads, cereals, rice and pasta. You may re-member from the information on the food guidepyramid that this food group is located on thelowtst level of the pyramid, the level from whichthe largest portion of our diet should come. (Youwill read more about carbohydrates in the infor-mation on the 4th dietary guideline, page 59.) Ifyou do not replace the calories lost when youlimit the fat in children's diets, you may beplacing their health at risk.In order to understand the recommenda-tion to lower fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol inthe diet, we need to know a little about fat andcholesterol. Page 41CHOLESTEROL:Cholesterol is a fat-like substance foundonly in animal fats and food products thatcome from animals, like meats and dairyproducts. Egg yolks and organ meats suchas liver are very high in cholesterol. Thehuman body can make all of the choles-terol it needs. The cholesterol we get fromanimal fats and other animal products isreally extra. This extra can cause fat tobuild up and block the blood's passagethrough the arteries. This can lead to heartdisease and hardening of the arteries.FATS:Fats are made up of two major kinds offatty acids. These are saturated fatty acidsand unsaturated fatty acids, including poly- 9 4 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines unsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats.All fats actually have both kinds of fattyacids, both saturated and unsaturated.When a food label reads \"saturated fat,\" itactually means that it is mainly saturatedfatty acids. When it says \"unsaturated\" orpolyunsaturated,\" it means it has mainlyunsaturated fatty acids and contains verylittle saturated fatty acids.SATURATED FATS:Saturated fats should be limited becausethey tend to raise the level of cholesterolin the blood and have beenlinked toincreased risk for heart disease. Saturatedfat is the main component of animal prod-ucts but can also be foundin some veg-etable products. These vegetable prod-ucts include coconut oil, cocoa butter,palm oil, and macadamia nuts. Saturatedfats are often solid at room temperature.UNSATURATED FATS:1. Polyunsaturated Fats:Polyunsaturated fats are fats that comefrom plant sources. Some medical re-searchers believe that they help lower thelevel of cholesterol in the blood. Corn oil,cotton seed oil, safflower oil, sunflowerseed oil, sesame seed oil, and soybean oilare high in polyunsaturatedfat.Choosesalad dressings, cooking fats, and marga-rines polyunsaturated list \"liquid corn oil\"or any other polyunsaturatedoil in liquidform, as the first ingredient on the label,are highest in polyunsaturated oils.2. Monounsaturated Fats:These fats do not increase blood choles-terol level and may be beneficial in low-ering cholesterol.Olive oil, peanut oil,canola oil, and margarines with partiallyhydrogenated oil listed on the label as thefirstingredientarehighinmonounsaturated fats.The following diagram shows where dif-ferent kinds of oils fall on a scale going fromliquid to solids. Liquid oils are polyunsaturated.Most vegetable oils are in this category. Solid oilsare saturated. These includebutter, lard, and thefat in meats. Monounsaturated and hydrogenatedoils fall somewhere in between liquid and solid.While researchers don't all agree on whetherpolyunsaturated or monounsaturated oils are bestto include in your diet, they do all tgree that youshould limit your intake of saturatod fat.

Page 429 5 Limiting saturated fat and cholesterol:To limit the amount of saturated fat andcholesterol you consume, decrease your intakeof the following foods: 1.Fat-rich pastries and desserts such asthose made with butter or cream. 2.Fats and oils especially those high insaturated fats such as butter, lard, and lardbased shortenings, heavily hydrogenatedfats (some margarines), and foods contain-ing palm and coconut oils .3. Fat- rich meats like organ meats, sausage,regular ground beef, and heavily marbledcuts of meats.4. High-fat dairy products such as wholemilk, cream, sour cream, and most cheeses.5. Foods that contain fat such as breaded anddeep-fried foods. Instead:1. Choose dry beans or dry peas as proteinsources.2. Choose skim or low-fat milk and milkproducts like yogurt and cheeses exceptwhen serving children under two. Chil-dren under two need the fat in whole milkand whole milk cheeses and yogurts. (Thereare many different kinds of cheeses. Somehave more fat than others. See the SpecialIssue Block on Choosing Cheese Wisely,page 94, for more detailed information onthe fat content of different cheeses.) Page 43Understanding the Dietary Guidelines 3. Choose lean meats like chicken, turkey,fish, lean beef cuts (top round, eye ofround, top loin and sirloin, lean ham-burger) and lean pork cuts (tenderloin,loin, chops, ham). The \"select\" gradecuts are the leanest grade. If \"select\"grade cuts are not available, choose \"choice\"grade. \"Prime\" grade contains the most fat.Avoid it if possible. Trim fat off all meatsand remove skin from chicken and tur-key before cooking.4. Select leaner ground beef. Generally thelower the price and the lighter the color,the more fat has been ground up with themeat. If you prefer not to pay extra forground beef with less fat, remove excess fatafter cooking by draining the meat.5. Use fat-free cooking methods like broil-ing, baking, grilling, poaching, steamingor boiling rather than frying. 6.Choose margarine and vegetable oilslike canola, corn, sunflower, soybean,and olive oils.7. Try angel food cake, frozen fruit bars orlow-fat frozen yogurt in place of richcreamy desserts.8. Use non-stick vegetable sprays to reduceadded fat when cooking.9. Serve vegetable and broth-based soupsor use low fat milk when making creamsoups.10. Serve tuna packed in water, not in oil. Understanding the Dietary Guidelines 11. Skip toppings like butter, margarine,gravy and sour creamwhich add extra fatand calories. Try using grated parmesancheese, herbed cottage cheese or low fatyogurt for toppings instead.12. Read food labels carefully to determineboth amount and type of fat present infoods. Remember: Your major concern isto lower your total fat andcholesterolintake. Limit foods containing animalfats.Choosefoodshigherinunsaturated,polyunsaturated,ormonounsaturated fats rather than insaturated fats.HINT: In most cases you will not need to giveup a favorite high-fatfood item. There areother ways you can reduce your fat intake.Consider: Page 441.Eating or serving a high-fat food lessoften.2. Eating or serving a smaller portion of ahigh-fat food item.

Both typesof labels give you information about the fatcontent of the food product and can help you toselect the product lowest in fat, saturated fat, andcholesterol.Ingredient LabelsMost packaged and processed foods in-clude a label listing the ingredients. Ingredientsare listed by weight, with the item present in thegreatest amount listed first, and the item presentin the least amount listed last. Although amountsof ingredients are not given, the order, number,and types of fats listed can be helpful. The follow-ing lists will help you identify ingredients high insaturated fat and ingredients high in unsaturatedfat.Ingredients High In FatButterCreamLardCocoa ButterCoconut OilPalm Oil Nutrition LabelsNutrition labels provide detailed informa-tion about the nutrients in a food product. Theylist the amount of fat in the product (in grams) perserving and usually give the product's percentageof calories from fat. Most nutrition labels alsogive the amounts of polyunsaturated fat, satu-rated fat, and cholesterol. When using the nutri-tion label to evaluate or compare food itemsaccording to their fat content, it is veryinportant to note the ,_lerving size listed on thelabel. Not all manufacturers of the same foodproduct base their measures of fat content on thesame servings size.In addition, what the foodmanufacturer calls a serving and what you mightcall a serving, are not necessarily the same. Understanding the Dietary GuidelinesExample 1:Comparing Mayonnaise and Imitation (Reduced Calorie) Mayonnaise This example compares labels from mayonnaise and imitation (reduced calorie) mayonnaise.First the ingredient labels are compared; Then the nutrition labels are compared. MAYONNAISEIngredients: Soybean oil, eggs, water, vin-egar, egg yolks, salt, sugar,lemon juice, pa-prika, dehydrated garlic, dehydrated onion,calcium d EDTA to protect flavor, naturalflavor. Both of these food products contain soy-bean oil, an ingredient high in unsaturated fat. Itis the first ingredient and therefore the majoringredient in the regular mayonnaise. Water is themajor ingTedient in the imitation mayonnaisewith soybean oil as the second ingredient. Thistells you that regular mayonnaise has more fat(unsaturated) than the imitation (reduced calorie)mayonnaise. Remember the following: To avoidfat, go easy on products listing fat or oil first,or listing many fat andoil ingredients on theirlabel.What if you werc interested in selectingthe mayonnaise with the least amount of choles-terol? How would you know which product toselect from reading the list of ingredients?IMITATION (REDUCED CALORIE)MAYONNAISEIngredients: Water, soybean oil, food starch-modified, egg yolks, vinegar, salt, eggs, mus-tard, flour, phosphoric acid, dl-x-tocopherylacetate (vitamin E), calcium d EDTA to pro-tect flavor, natural and artificial flavor, oleo-resin, paprika, beta carotene (color). Soybean oil does not contain cholesterol.(Only products of animal origin can containcholesterol.) However, both kinds of mayon-naise list eggs and egg yolks among their ingredi-ents. Eggs, especially the egg yolks, are high incholesterol. The regular mayonnaise lists eggs asthe 2nd ingxedient and egg yolks as the 5thingredient. The imitation mayonnaise lists eggyolks as the 4th ingredient and eggs as the .7thingredient.It is impossible to tell from thisinformation which product contains the leastamount of cholesterol. All we can know from thelist of ingredients is that both the mayonnaise andthe imitation (reduced calorie) mayonnaise con-tain cholesterol. To determine actual cholesterolcontent, it is best to read thenutrition labels. 1 05Page 52 MAYONNAISENutrition information information provided nutri-tion labels,it is easy to compare the fat andcholesterol content of different products. Thenutrition labels of the two kinds of mayonnaisseused in the example show that compared tomayonnaise, an imitation (reduced calorie)mayonnaise may contain only half as muchfat, but about the same amount of cholesterol.If you wanted to limit your overall fat con-sumption, you would choose the imitation(reduced calorie) mayonnaise.Understanding the Dietary Guidelines IMITATION (REDUCED CALORIE)MAYONNAISENutrition information servingServing tablespoon 90mg If your only concern was limiting your choles-terol intake, you would not benefit from usingthe imitation (reduced calorie) mayonnaise. Abetter way for you to reduce your cholesterolintake might be to reduce the amount of may-onnaise you consume, or replace the mayon-naise in your diet with a lower cholesterolalternative. Page 531 n 6 Understanding the Dietary GuidelinesExample 2:Comparing 2 Different Kinds of Yogurt The following example compares labels from two different kinds of yogurt. The first label is froma fruit on the bottom yogurtin which the fat has not been reduced. The second label is from a non-fatyogurt. Nutrition labels arecompared first; then ingredients labels are compared. FRUIT ON THE BOTTOM YOGURTNutrition information grade A milk, skim milk,peaches, sugar, corn sweeteners, pectin,natural flavors and yogurt mixed concentrate, whey protein con-centrate, annatto (for color). The serving sizes are the same (I cup) for both kinds of yogurt. The fruit on the bottom yogurtis made with milk (which means whole milk) and skim milk. It contains 3 grams of fat and 10milligrams of cholesterol. The non-fat yogurt is made with non-fat milk. It has no fat or cholesterol.If you were concerned with lowering the fat and cholesterol in your diet, your best choice would bethe non-fat yogurt. 17 Page 54 Understanding the Dietary GuidelinesExample 3:Comparing Two Different Kinds of Breakfast Cereal In this example, two different breakfast cereals are compared. Note that the first cereal is labeledas \"All Natural Low Fat. \" The label \"all natural\" can mean many things and does not necessarily meanthe product is better for you than a product without the \"all natural\" label. Similarly, labeling a product\"low-fat\" only means that the company has to provide you with the information on fat content.It does not necessarily mean that the product has less fat than a similar product. New labeling lawsestablishing standard definitions for terms like \"low-fat\" and regulating their use are expected to go intoeffect soon. Until then, don't just believe the food manufacturers' claims about fat content or thenutritional content of the food product. Read the labels. BRAND A CEREAL:AllNatural, Low FatNutrition Information (per serving)Serving Size : 1 Information (per serving)Serving size: 1 1/4 55 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines BRAND A CEREALIngredients:Whole wheat, rolled oats, sugar,corn, brown sugar, partially hydrogenatedsoybean andlor oil, malted barley,salt, corn syrup, food coloring(yellow No.5), BHT, MSG. The first thing you might notice when youcompare the nutrition labelsfrom these two cere-als is that their serving sizes differ. The servingsize for Brand A is 1 ounce or about 2/3 cup whilethe serving size for Brand B is 1 1/4 ounce orabout 3/4 cup. An average adult will eat about 2ounces (1 1/3 cup). If youwanted to comparecalories for these two cereals, the differentserving sizes could fool you. Both cereals have110 calories per serving, but because the servingsize is smaller forcereal A, cereal A is the highestin calories.When you compare fat for the two cerealsused in this example, you notice a surprising fact.The cereal labeled low-fat contains more fat than1BRAND B CEREALIngredients: Wheat bran with other parts ofwheat, raisins, sugar, corn syrup, salt, maltflavoring, iron, niacinamide, D. the cereal without the low-fat label. In addition,one serving of the low-fat cereal would provideyou with 10mg of cholesterol. The list of ingre-dients from the low-fat cereal (Brand A) showsthat either soybean oil or coconut oil is used. Thelabel does not specify which one is used, but inlerms of the kind of fat the product contains, itmakes a big difference. Soybean oil is polyun-saturated; coconut oil is saturated.The other cereal used in this example(Brand B) contains no fat, saturated fat or choles-terol. If you were concerned with limiting yourintake of fat, saturated fat and cholesterol, youwould choose Brand B. A Shortcut for Evaluating Food Items by the Grams of Fat Listed On Labels:In making wise food choices it is helpful to have some idea about what is considered a high fatfood item, and what is considered a low fat food item. This will be different depending upon whetherthe food item is an entree, a side dish or dessert. The following chart provides a guideline for evaluatingfood items by the fat content listed on food labels.Fat Grams for Entrees0-9 grams10-15 gramsmore than the Dietary GuidelinesCalculating Fat ConsumptionSupportingirmationFor the Provider Who Wants To Know More The American Heart Association and otherhealth organizations recommend that individu-als over 2 years old limit their fat intake to 30 %of their total calorie intake and limit saturatedfat to no more than 10% of the total fat intake.It would be very time-consuming to keep track ofyour daily calorie intake and calculate the numberof calories you derived from fat. Luckily there isan easier method. While it is not exact it will giveyou a good guideline to follow.Remember: the American Heart Association rec-ommendation does not mean that you should limityour fat to 30% of calorie intake for each meal.This recommendation applies to your diet as awhole, all of your meals over several days. Somemeals will exceed the recommended fat intake,others may be much less . They should average outto comply with the recommendation.big appetite and chooses foods with lots of calo-ries. The next day he/she just doesn't seem veryinterested in eating at all.However, here is ageneral range of daily calorie consumption forchildren 3-6. (Remember, you do not want to limitfat in the diets of children 2 years old or younger.)On the average, children between the ages of 3and 6 will consume between 1,500 and 1,800calories a day. This means that they shouldconsume between 50 and 60 grams of total fatand between 5 and 6 grams of saturated fat.*The average number of calories consumed dailyby women between the ages of 23 and 50 is 2,000.Here is the form& i you can use to calculate therecommended fat consumption. 1. Take the total number of calories consumeddaily and multiply by .3 give an average forthe number of calories consumed daily by chil-dren.In general, we know that boys usuallyconsume a little more than girls, and calorieconsumption increases with age. But, calorieintake for children can change dramaticallyfrom one day to the next. One day a child has aDivide that number by 9. (There are 9calories in each gram of fat.) The answergives you the maximum number of gramsof total fat you should consume daily.3. Divide that number by 10, and you have themaximum number of grams of fat thatshould be saturated fat.number of calories times .3 = XX divided by 9 = grams of total fatgrams of fat divided by 10 =grams of saturated fat Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Example: The recommended fat consumptionfor a child 4 years old who eats apprwimately1,800 calories a day is:1,800 x .3 = 540540/9 = 60 grams of fat60/10 = 6 grams of saturated fat Page 58 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines 4. CHOOSE A DIET VVITH PLENTYOF VEGETABLES, FRUITS,AND GRAIN PRODUCTSSO THAT YOU GET ADEQUATESTARCH AND FIBER.

It is ourmajor source of energy. Complex carbohydratesare supplied by the foods that make up the lowesttwo levels of the food guide pyramid. Thelowest of these levels, the food group fromwhich the largest portion of our diet shouldcome, is the breads, cereals, pastas, and othergrain products. ( This food group is also benefi-cial as an alternative to high-fat animal sources ofprotein.)The next level of the food guidepyramid and our second good source of com-plex carbohydrates or starch is vegetables andfruits. Foods from these two levels of the foodguide pyramid should make up the bulk of ourdiet.Starches or complex carbohydrates playan even more important role in our diets when weare limiting our intake of fat as recommended indietary guideline #3.Fat is high in calories,which means it is a good source of energy. If welimit fat without making up for the calorie losswith other foods, we reduce our energy level. Inorder to maintain the same energy level, when welower the fat in our diet, we should increase ourintake of complex carbohydrates (starch). Thisis vital in children's diets. Children are activeand burn a lot of calories. They must have agood source of energy.Even though carbohydrates are an essen-tial part of the diet, some people still believe theyare to be avoided. The misinformation aboutcarbohydrates may be due to two factors.1. At one time dieters avoided many of thesestarchy foods because they thought that theywere high in calories.However, it is not thestarchy foods themselves that are high in caloriesbut the toppings, like butter, sour cream, or creamsauces, that people sometimes add to starchyfoods. Starches provide only 4 calories per gram,while fat provides 9 calories per gram. Withouthigh fat toppings, or with only moderate amounts,complex carbohydrate foods can be less fatteningthan animal-protein foods that naturally containfat.2. Carbohydrates come in two forms: complexcarbohydrates or starch and simple carbohydratesor sugar. Sugar has little nutritional value beyondthe calories it provides. However, unlike sugar,starches provide us with energy plus manyother essential nutrients. Some Good Sources of Starch Include:Breads, whole grain and whiteBreakfast cereals, cooked and ready-to-eatFlours, whole-grain and whitePastas, like spaghetti and macaroniRice and barleyDry peas, dry beans, and lentilsStarchy vegetables such as potatoes, butter beans, corn, sweet peas, lima beans, and navy beans. Page 61113 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know The same foods which provide us withcomplex carbohydrates also provide us with di-etary fiber, sometimes called \"roughage.\" Di-etary fiber refers to parts of plant foods that aregenerally not digestible by humans. Even thoughdietary fiber is not digestible, it is still importantto include in our diets. Eating foods high in fiberreduces the symptoms of chronic constipation,some intestinal diseases like diverticulardisease, and some types of \"irritable bowel.\"Recent scientific research suggests high fiberdiets may also reduce the risk of colon cancer.The following lists contain commonfoods which are rated as either high fiberfoods (shown on the left) or low fiber foods(shown on the right). HIGH FIBER FOODS INCLUDE:Whole wheat flour and whole grain breadsShredded cereals, creams of wheat andwhite ricerefined (white) flourcooked and canned fruitsmilkcheesemeatseggs Warning About Children and Fiber:Children do not need to eat as muchfiber as adults. Eating too much fiber cancause problems for children.1. Foods containing fiber add bulk and makechildren feel full.Children need somefiber in their diets but too much may fillthem up so they don't have room for theother foods they need to supply them withthe essential nutrients.2. Too much fiber may give a child gas orloose bowels.3. Too much fiber can interfere with thebody's ability to absorb other nutrients.Because too much fiber can cause prob-lems for children, let children get fiber fromthe foods that contain it naturally. For someadults it may be wise to eat cereals and breadswith extra fiber added.These foods are notPage 631 1 4 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines recommended for children. Serving a variety offruits, vegetables, breads, cereals, and grainproducts is sufficient to insure that childrenget adequate but not excessive fiber. There is noneed to serve children foods in which fiber fromsome other source has beenadded.As an adult, you may want to considerincluding foods with added fiber in your diet.To be sure that children get adequate starchand fiber:Choose foods that are good sources of fiberand starch such as whole-grain breads andcereals, fruits, vegetables, and dry beansand peas.Substitute starchy foods for those that havehigh amounts of fat and sugars. Constipation and Children Don't worry if a child in your care does not have a bowel movement every day. Ifthe stool is soft, the child is probably not constipated. Constipation usually causes a hard,dry stool that is hard to pass. If you do think the child is constipated, do not give himor her laxatives or othermedications. Instead, mention your concern to the child'sparents. They may need to take the child to see a health care provider to make sure thereare no other problems.To help prevent constipation, make sure the children in your care drinkplenty of liquids, eat foods rich in fiber like fresh fruits and vegetables and wholegrain breads, and get plenty of exercise. Work with parents to help children establishregular bowel habits. Because eating or drinking often stimulates bowel movements, afterthe meal may be the best time for a child to sit on the toilet. Children need about 10 minutesof unrushed time each day for toileting.

State Dept. of Education, April 1990.Page 65 116 Understanding the Diztary Guidelines Special Issue:Vegetables - Should I Purchase Fresh, Frozen, or Canned ? Most people assume that fresh vegetables are better nutritionally than frozen orcanned. This is not necessarily true. Fresh vegetables do provide more nutrients thancanned vegetables. The high temperatures used in canning destroy some vitamins andminerals. In addition, canned vegetables are usually high in sodium. While cannedvegetables are certainly better t han no vegetables, if you are choosing between freshand canned, fresh is the better choice. However, fresh vegetables are not always betterthan frozen. Frozen vegetables may contain as many or more vitamins and minerals thanthe \"fresh\" product. To a great extent it depends on how fresh the \"fresh\" product is. In today's food market you can get almost any vegetable, \"fresh,\" all year round.Vegetables out-of-season in your area are grown in other areas and shipped to your localgrocery. Unfortunately, vegetables start to lose their nutritional value as soon as theyare picked. So vegetablespicked green and shipped to your grocery store may lack thenutritional quality that we usually associate with \"fresh\" produce.If \"fresh\" meansgrown locally and picked recently, then nutritionally \"fresh\" is probably your bestchoice. The sooner vegetables can be eaten after being picked, the higher theirnutritional value. But if fresh means picked weeks ago and shipped to your localmarket, they may actually be inferior to the frozen product. Producers of frozenvegetables usually select the best, pick them at their peak of ripeness, and freeze themimmediately. This freezing process has little effect on nutritional quality.But what about price? Stretching food dollars is a concern for all of us.It is impossible to identify fresh, frozen, or canned as the most for your money in everycase. However, there are some general rules.(1) Vegetables in season are usually a better dollar value than those not in season.(2) Vegetables in season are usually a better dollar value if purchased fresh, thanthose same vegetables purchased canned or frozen.(3) When choosing between fresh and frozen vegetables not in season, frozth isprobably the better buy. You can usually purchase frozen vegetables in large bags,and there is almost always a price advantage when you buy large quantities.As a general rule- buy fresh vegetables when they are fresh- when they arein season, ripe and appear recently picked. Otherwise, buy the frozen vegetables.When you must use canned vegetables, look for the brands with the lowest sodium.

Too often we areserving foods high in sugar without even realizingit. There ?re two major problems with feedingchildren too much sugar or too many foodshigh in sugar. 1.If children are filling up on sugar orsweet foods, they may not be eatingenough of the more nutritious foodsneeded to meet all of their nutritionalrequirements. Reduce the total amount ofsweets you offer and serve foods that arenaturally sweet, like fresh fruits, whichalso have other nutritional benefits likevitamins A and C and fiber. 2. Sugar causes tooth decay. Tooth decayis not simply a matter of how much sugaris eaten, but how .tften sugar is eaten andwhether or not the food is sticky. The morefrequently you eat foods that contain sugar,the greater the Tisk for tooth decay espe-cially if sweet foods are eaten betweenmeals and if they stick to your teeth. Don't make sugary snacks a habit. In-stead of serving high sugar snacks, make snacktime another chance to meet the children'snutritional needs. Serve snacks like fresh fruitor vegetables,cheese or peanut butter, and crack-ers . Avoid sweet and sticky snacks like candy anddried fruit. When children do consume foods highin sugar, encourage them to brush their teethafterwards.The sugar in our diets comes from threemajor sources.1. We add table sugar, also called sucrose orrefined sugar, to some of the foods we eat.2. Food manufacturers often add sugar tofoods as they are processed. On foodlabels the sugar in foods may be calleddextrose, sucrose, fructose, glucose, mal-tose, lactose, corn syrups, corn sweeteners,natural sweeteners, and invert sugars.3. Sugar is present naturally in some foodslike pears, bananas and corn.To avoid too much sugar: Page 69Use less of all sugars and food containinglarge amounts of sugar, including whitesugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, rawsugar, honey, and syrups.Examples in-clude soft drinks, candies, cakes, and cook-ies.Remember, how often you eat sugar andsugar-containing food is as important ashow much sugar you eat. Try to avoid eatingsweets between meals. Snack on fresh fruitsor vegetables instead.Read food labels for clues on sugar content.Ingredients are listed in order of the amountthe product contains.If name sugar,sucrose, glucose, maltose, dextrose, lac-tose, fructose, or syrups appears first, then 1 1 9 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines there is more sugar in the product than anyother ingredient. (There will be more aboutthis in the special issue block on sugar andcereals.) Choose brands lower in sugar orsearch for other foods to use in their place.Select fresh fruits or fruits canned in theirown juice or in light,rather than he ivy,syrup. If you do serve fruitspacked in heavysyrup, rinse them offbefore serving.Drink water and fruit juice instead of softdrinks, fruit drinks, powdered drinks, andpunches.Fruit drinks, powdered drinks,and punches are usually loaded with sugarand soft drinks and have no nutritionalvalue.Try reducing the amount of sugar you putin unsweetened drinks.Try putting less sugar in your favorite reci-pes. Reduce the amount alittle at a time soyou can decide what amount is right for you.NOTE:1. When serving children, do not useartificial sweeteners or foods or dietdrinks that contain them. Many peoplebelieve that these chemicals are not goodfor children. Though we don't know forsure that they are harmful, we do know thatthere are other ways to safely lower theamount of sugar in children's diets.Choose the safe, healthy ways and avoidartificial sweeteners. 2.Children under 2 should not eathoney or products containing honey,even if the products arebaked. All honeycontains botulism spores, an organism thatcauses food poisoning.For children un-der 1 year old, honey can cause severeillness and even death. Page 791 2 0 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines-.. PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know Ingredient LabelsWhile ingredients labels will not give youthe exact amount of sugar a product contains, theycan give you a rough idea about the sugar content.Ingredients are listed in order by weight from thegreatest to the least. If sugar or one of the namesused for sugar is listed as one of the first threeingredients, or if several names for sugar arelisted on the label, the product is probably highin sugar. In this situation it would be best tosearch for a low sugar alternative.These are some of the names used for sugar.SugarLactoseSucroseMann itolGlucoseHoneyDextroseCorn syrupSorbitolHigh-fructose cornFructosesyrupMaltoseMolassesMaple syrupXylitolWhat does the following ingredient label tellyou about the sugar content of the food prod-uct?Ingredients: Bleached flour, sugar, par-tially hydrogenated vegetable shortening,dextrose, water, corn syrup, carob, wheyblend, cornstarch, salt, sodium bicarbon-ate, lecithin, artificial flavorings, and arti-ficial colors.From the label you can tell that this productcontains three different kinds of sugars: su-ar,dextrose, and corn syrup. These sugars are thesecond, fourth and sixth ingredients listed. Thisindicates that this product is probably high insugar.Nutrition LabelsThis nutrition label from a cereal box lists\"sucrose and other sugars\" under \"CarbohydrateInformation.\" Remember: Sugar is a simple car-bohydrate. What does this label tell you about thesugar content of the cereal?Nutrition Information(Per Serving)Serving size: 2/3 cup (1 ounce 28.3 Box: 181 oz.with 1/2 cup skim than of naturally occurringsugars Page 711 21 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines This cereal is virtually sugar free. If served withmilk there are approximately 6 grams of sugar ina serving. This is becausethe milk contains natu-rally occurring sugars. This sugar is not the kindof sugar that we are concerned about limiting inour diet. Page 72102 1 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Special Issue: Myths About SugarMuch has been written and said about sugar in recent years. Much of it is untrue.This Special Issue Block looks at some of the more common myths about sugar.1. Sugar and Diabetes:There is a common belief that sugar causes diabetes. This is incorrect. Too muchsugar does not cause diabetes. People with diabetes tend to have high levels of blood sugarfor many different reasons. The most common type of diabetes occurs in people who areobese. A family history of diabetes, obesity, and advancing age are among the manycontributing factors to diabetes.2. Sugar and Obesity:It is true that most sweet foods are also high in calories. However, sweet foodsare often high in fat as well. In many cases the majority of the calories in sweet foodscome from the fat they contain rather than the sugar. These foods may contribute to somepeople being overweight; and by eliminating them, these individuals may lose weight.However, one loses weight by reducing total calorie consumption, regardless of thesource of the calories. Please note however, that obesity is very complex and is affectedby a variety of factors. Calorie intake is only one of those factors.3. Sugar and Hyperactive Children:Many people associate sugar with hyperactivity or moodiness. Although someparents and family child care providers insist that this association is real, scientific studiesdo not support the claim. There is no scientific evidence that eating sugar makes childrenhyperactive or moody.4. Sugar Addiction:Some people believe that individuals can become addicted to sugar. This is nottrue. It is true that --e humans have a natural preference for sweet foods, and perhaps somepeople would like to believe that an \"addiction\" explains their over consumption.However, there is no scientific evidence that one can become physically addicted to sugar.5. Raw Sugar:There are some people who believe that raw sugar and brown sugar are morenutritious than white table sugar. This is not true. Like white table sugar, raw sugarand brown sugar have no nutritive value.6. Honey:Some people believe that honey is better for children than table or white sugar.Honey is not a good substitute for sugar. Not only is honey no more nutritious than othersugars, but for some children, honey can be dangerous. All honey contains botulinumspores, an organism that causes food poisoning. For children under 1 year old, honey cancause severe illness and even death. It should not be served raw or used in preparing foodssuch as cookies. Page 7319 .6 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Special Issue: Nutritious Snacks Why are snacks so important for children?Childhood is a time of rapid growth and development. Seeing that children getan adequate amount ofnutrients and calories to support this growth and development isvery important. It is difficult for children to get enough calories and nutrients from theirmeals alone. For this reason, they need nutritious mid-morning and mid-afternoonsnacks.Considerations in Selecting Nutritious Snacks1. Avoid snack foods that are high in sugar.Read the food labels. If sugar is listed first, then the food contains more sugar than anyother item. And remember, sugar goes by many other names, like sucrose, glucose,maltose, dextrose, lactose, fructose, or syrups.Cookies, cakes, candies, and soft drinks are obvious high sugar snacks. They also tendto be expensive.Many cereals are also high in sugar. Check the label on the box. If sugar is the 1st or2nd ingredient, the cereal contains too much sugar.Juices can also be misleading. If the label reads \"fruit drink\" or \"punch,\" avoid it.Choose only juices which say 100% juice on the label, with no sugar added. Labels thatsay \"100% natural\" are notnecessarily 100% juice.If you serve canned fruits, choose ones that are packed in fruit juice, water, or lightsyrup.2. Avoid snack foods high in fat and salt or sodium.Most potato chips and corn chips are high in both.Ice cream is high in fat.Crackers can also be high in both so choose them carefully. Crackers that are low in fatand salt (sodium) and w:ich make good snacks for children include graham crackers,unsalted saltines, melba toast, matzo, rice cakes, wasa, Rye Krisp, bread sticks, andZwieback. (See the Special Issue on Choosing Crackers , page 96, for more informa-tion.) Page 74 194 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines 3. Make sure you serve foods that are safe for children at their age.Some foods may be too hard for younger children to chew or may cause choking.Do not give small, hard, round foods to infants and young children.These foods may cause choking in children.hot dogs nutsseeds chipspopcorn grapesgranola raisins and other small fruitshard round vegetables like carrot sticksThese foods make great nutritious snacks for children.mild cheeses raw vegetablescrackers peanut buttercereal fruit juiceboiled eggs milkfruit applesauceyogurt bread seedless grapes cut in halftomato soup muffinsHere are some serving suggestions.Crackers go well with both peanut butter and cheese. Serve an assortment andlet the children choose.Dry cheerios make a great snack for a toddler learning to feed him or herself.Cut up pieces of fruit and put them in plain yogurt. Serve it as yogurt and fruit, or adda little milk, mix it in the blender, and you have a yogurt fruit shake.Make an open faced sandwich with peanut butter or cheese and bread. Let the childrendecorate it with fruit pieces, raisins or shredded carrots.Use fruit juice to make homemade frozen treats.Melt cheese on a tortilla, cut in quarters, and serve. Make sure the cheese is not too hot.Make small pancakes, spread with peanut butter or applesauce, and roll them up.Make \"dinosaur eggs.\" Boil eggs and crack but do not peel them. Place them in a bowlof water mixed with food coloring (no vinegar) and put them in the refrigeratorovernight.Serve them to the children the next day. Just let them peel and eat. The coloring effectwill surprise and delight them. Page 75 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Cut vegetables and fruits into bite size pieces and serve them plain or serve them with adip or spread. For example:Stuff celery sticks with peanut butter or spread peanut butter on apple slices. Top witha few raisins.Make a dip for vegetables by adding herbs to cottage cheese and mixing it in theblender. Try spreading this dip on a lettuce or spinach leaf and rolling it up. Be creative. Think of your own fun recipes using the foods listed on the previouspage. 0 6 Page 76 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Special Issue: The Sugar Content of Cereals Many cereals contain so much sugar that they might be more appropriately calledcandy. This can be especially true of the cereals marketed to children. For example,refmed sugars make up 40 to 60 percent of cereals such as Cap'n Crunch, Trix, FrootLoops, Fruity Marshmallow Krispies and Ghostbusters.There are many other cereals that are mainly sugar, and new ones are always beingplaced on the market. Check the contents listed on the side panel of the cereal box. Ifsugar is the first ingredient listed, then the product contains more sugar than any otheringredient. And remember, there are many other names for sugar, such as honey,sucrose, glucose, maltose, dextrose, lactose, fructose, corn sweeteners, and cornsyrups. Don't let the names fool you. It is all sugar. These cereals are not recommended.They promote a \"sweet tooth\" and encourage poor eating habits. Further, they areexpensive. Those of you enrolled in the Child and Adult Care Food Program will notbe reimbursed for serving them.It is almost impossible to keep an up-to-date list of the different cereals and howthey rate in terms of sugar content. However, the following \"rule of thumb\" will help youselect a nutritious cereal. There are exceptions to this list. For example, some cereals haveonly two ingredients. Although sugar may be listed as the second ingredient, the sugarcontent may not actually be that high. For a more accurate measure of sugar content, usethe formula presented in the supporting information on Determining the Sugar Contentof Cereal, page 81.Sugar, or one of the other words meaning sugar, listed as the 1st ingredient:Not RecommendedNot Accepted by the Child and Adult Care Food ProgramSugar, or one of the other words meaning sugar, listed as the 2nd ingredient:Not RecommendedAccepted by the Child and Adult Care Food ProgramSugar, or one of the other words meaning sugar, listed as the 3rd ingredient:Accepted by the Child and Adult Care Food ProgramSugar, or one of the other words meaning sugar, listed as the 4th, 5th, etc.ingredient, or not at all.Highly RecommendedAccepted by the Child and Adult Care Food Program Page 771 97 Understanding the Dietary GuidelinesA Guide to BreakfastCereals RECOMMENDED(0-10% sugar by GramsLife 6Crunchy Corn 6Nature Valley Natural Oat 6Quaker Oat Squares 6Quaker Oat Bran 6Kellogg's Oat Bake (Honey Bran) 6Oatmeal Crisp 6Post Oat Flakes 6Kellogg's Raisin Squares 6Kellogg's Oat Bran** 7Kellogg's Buds 7Post Bran 7Nutri-Grain Almond Raisin 7Kellogg's Craklin Oat Bran 7Kellogg's Double Raisin-Nut Bran Mini-Wheats includes high fructose corn syrup, honey, mo-lasses, fructose,glucose,dextrose,malto-dextrin, and levulose.

Page 1 9 9 Understanding the Dietary GuidelinesDetermining the Sugar Content of CerealSupporting InformationFor the Provider Who Wants To Know MoreThe information provided in a precedingspecial issue block gives a general guideline forselecting a low-sugar cereal. It will work in mostcases. Sometimes, however, cereal labels arewritten in a way that seems to hide the amountof sugar in the product. Rather than using onlyone kinds of sugar and listing it on the label onetime, manufacturers use a combination of manydifferent kinds of sugar. These sugars are alllisted on the label separately by their differentnames. For example, the term sugar might be the3rd ingredient listed on the label. But if you wereto read further, you might find several othernames for sugar listed, like maltose, and honey. Ifyou were to add up the amounts of all thedifferent kinds of sugar listed, the sugar con-tent might be much higher than you firstthought.Many of you will want to stick with thesimpler method for judging cereals in terms oftheir sugar content. That method works well incomparing cereals, especially if you keep in mindthe different names for sugar that might appear onthe label.However, if you would like to determinemore accurately the amount of sugar in aparticular cereal, use the following formula.A typical individual serving size is about Iounce. The ingredients listed on the side panelshould tell the number of ounces per serving size.Each ounce has 28 grams.From the list of ingredients, find out how manygrams of sucrose or sugar there are per ounce (orper 28 grams).Then divide the number of grams of sucrose ina serving by 28 grams (the number of grams ofcereal in a serving.) This will give you the per-centage of sugar in the cereal.EXAMPLE: 1 oz. = 28 grams? grams of sucrose per ounce? grams sucrose divided by 28 grams in serv-ing = % of sucrose or sugar in cereal(Corn Bran has 6 grams of sucrose per ounce.)6 grams divided by 28 = .21 = 21% sugar.When you use this formula to determine the sugarcontent of cereals, use the following as a guide-line for evaluating cereals: 1,1Cereals With AddedNot Recommended,May Not Be Reimbursable Understanding the Dietary Guidelines In this section you will learn about:limiting salt and sodiumreading food labels for sodium contentpage 85page 91 There is a helpful chart on:Ithe sodium content of selected foods page 87 To learn more, read the supporting information:understanding terms for reduced sodium 1page 101 There is also information on special issues:seasoning cheese wiselychoosing crackershigh blood pressurepage 89page 102 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines I PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Provider Should Know While it is true that our bodies need so-dium (salt), mostAmericans get too much. Theaverage American adult consumes between8,500 and 13,500 mgs. of salt per day, or 4 to 6teaspoons. The National Research Council of theNational Academy of Sciences suggests that a\"safe and adequate\" amount of sodium foradults is between (mgs.) and3,300 milligrams (mgs.) daily. would beequal to between about 'one-half and one andone-half teaspoons of salt a day. Although thereis no established amount of salt recommended forchildren, we can assume that they should eat evenless than adults.High sodium diets are one of the riskfactors for high blood pressure, and mayaggravate high blood pressure once it exists.Although children seldom suffer from highblood pressure, children do learn food prefer-ences which contribute to high blood pressureas they grow older. A likeness for salty foods isone such habit. It will be much easier for childrento become accustomed to low sod:Im (salt) foodswhen they are younger, than when they are olderand need to reduce sodium because of a healthproblem. In addition, a low sodium diet through-out life can help an individual avoid high bloodpressure altogether.Table salt is composed of two majorcomponents, sodium and chloride. One tea-spoon of salt contains 2,000 milligrams (mgs.)of sodium. Sodium is also found in many of theingredients and additives used in processing foods,like monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavor en-hancer, and sodium benzoate, a preservative.Any food ingredient with sodium in the namecontains sodium. Other sources of sodium in-clude baking soda, baking powder, and sodiumsaccharin, the artificial sweetener more com-monly called saccharin.Salt, or more specifically the salt shaker,is by far the major source of sodium in ourdiets. This is why most of the recommenda-tions for avoiding or limiting sodium, focus onavoiding or limiting salt.To lower your consumption of sodium,use less table salt when you prepare foods, andavoid prepackaged foods with high salt orsodium content. Some prepackaged foods thatare high in sodium, like potato chips, taste salty.Other foods high in sodium, like frankfurters, donot. Sodium occurs naturally in some foods andin others it is added as a preservative or curingagent. Foods with a long shelf life are often highin sodium. You cannot rely on taste to deter-mine the sodium content of foods. Read thefood labels.The lists on pages 87 and 88 give theapproximate sodium content of some foods com-monly found on family child care provider menus. Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Suggestions For Lowering Sodium (Salt) Intake:The following suggestions will help youto lower the sodium in your diet and in the mealsand snacks you serve children.Learn to enjoy the flavors of unsalted foods.Cook without salt or add as little salt aspossible. If you typically use lots of salt, trycutting back gradually. You will becomeaccustomed to less salt over time.If you must add salt, it is best to do so afterthe food is cooked, not during cooking.Food will taste more \"salty\" when salt issprinkled on it, rather than when it is cookedinto it. Try to add as little as possible andtaste food before salting.Don't put the salt shaker on the table. Itmakes it too easy to pour on the salt.Try using herbs, spices, and lemon juiceinstead of salt to add flavor to foods. Page 86Limit your intake of salty foods such aspotato chips, pretzels, salted nuts and pop-corn, condiments (soy sauce, steak sauce,garlic salt), pickled foods, sandwich meats,frankfurters, some cheeses, and some cannedvegetables, soups, and stews.Try the versions of processed foods likesoups, salad dressings, and sauces, that arelabeled \"low sodium.\" (See page 101 forinformation on labels for low sodium prod-ucts.)Read the food labels carefully to deterininethe amounts of sodium. (See page 91 formore on reading food labels for sodiumcontent.) Look for alternatives to foods withlots of sodium, or, if one brand has lesssodium than another, choose it.

Below are recipes forthree seasoning blends that you can make at home. Blend them thoroughly. Put someof the seasoning blend in a shaker to be placed on the table. Store the extra in atightly covered glass container.

One way to limit sodium is tochoose the lower sodium food products from yourgrocery store shelves. In order to do this, you needto know how to determine sodium content fromreading the food labels.Labels from two different products areused to demonstrate how to read labels for sodiumcontent. Example 1 gives the nutrition and ingre-dient labels from a can of vegetable soup. Ex-ample 2 gives the nutrition and ingredient labelsfrom a can of spaghetti in tomato sauce.Nutrition LabelsNutrition labels tell you how many mil-ligrams of sodium the product contains perserving. As is the case anytime you read nutritionlabels, be sure to check the serving size. Servingsize is determined by the food manufacturer andcan vary from one product to another. You willneed to ask yourself how much of the productyou plan to eht or serve. A product that isrelatively low in sodium per serving may provideyou with a lot of sodium if you really consume twoservings.Ingredient LabelsIngredient labels give you the ingredi-ents of the product with the ingredient presentin the largest quantity by weight first, and theingredient present in the smallest quantity byweight last. When you read ingredient labels forsodium content, keep in mind all of the differentingredients that contain sodium. These are:salt, including seasoning salts like onionand garlic salt;any ingredient with sodium as part of itsname, for example, monosodium gluta-mate and sodium benzoate;baking powder, baking soda, and saccha-rin. Page19117 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Exa_ :e 1: Vegetable Soup (made with beef stock) Nutrition Label:Nutrition information per servingServing SOUP (made with beefstock)Ingredients: Beef stock, tomatoes, pota-toes, carrots, peas, green beans, corn, highfructose corn syrup, enriched alphabetmacaroni, onions, celery, salt, potato starch,vegetable oil, yeast extract and hydrolyzedvegetable protein, monosodium garlic, caramel color,natural oleoresin paprika.Canned soups, like this one, are usuallyhigh in sodium. According to the nutrition label,this soup would provide you with 830 mg ofsodium per serving. The serving size is 4 ounces.If mixed with an equal amount of water as thedirections specify, a serving would be 8 ounces (1cup). If you use less water, the sodium content ishigher. How much soup would you eat or serve aspart of a meal. Do you really only have one cup?The ingredient label shows that there aretwo ingredients in this soup which contain so-dium. They are salt and monosodium glutamate.Salt is the 12th ingredient listed; monosodiumglutamate is the 17th ingredient listed. It could besomewhat misleading tojudge the sodium contentof this food item simply from reading the list ofingredients. Neither salt nor monosodium gluta-mate are listed near the top. However, ingredientsare listed by weight. One teaspoon of salt weighsve*y little yet it contains 2,000 milligrams ofsodium. In determining sodium content, it isbest to read the nutrition labels. Page 92 Example 2: Spaghetti in Tomato Sauce: Cholesterol Free!IreNutrition Label:Nutrition information en-riched spaghetti, high fructose corn syrup,salt.Understanding the Dietary Guidelines This food item illustrates one of the diffi-culties in selecting foods that will provide us witha healthy diet. This food item is labelled \"choles-terol free.\" While it is cholesterol free, it is notlow in sodium. Salt is the only ingredient listedwhich contains sodium, and it is the last ingre-dient listed. This could lead you to believe thatthe food product may be low in sodium. How-ever, when you read the nutrition label, youlearn otherwise. One serving of this spaghettiin tomato sauce would give you 900 milligramsof sodium.Always read the labels, especially thenutrition labels. You cannot assume that afood product good for you in some respects, isgood for you in all respects. And you can'tdetermine sodium content from taste. Whether or not you select this product willdepend on the other foods in your diet. If highcholesterol is a problem for you and for the mostpart, you have a diet low in sodium this food maybe a wise selection. Reading the label will helpyou to make the decision that is best for you andthe children you are feeding. V40)3 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Special Issue: ChoosingCheese Wisely There are many different kinds of cheeses. These cheeses not onlydiffer in taste, color, and texture, but they also differ in the amounts offat and sodium they contain. Although virtually all cheeses containsignificant amounts of fat and sodium, some cheeses have more thanothers.In addition, some cheeses may be relatively high in fat butrelatively low in sodium, or vice versa. The cheese that is right for you oryour children will depend upon individual dietary needs and concerns, aswell as the fat and sodium content of the other foods consumed.The chart on the next page ranks cheeses by both their fat andsodium contents. 1 4 0 Page 94 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines A Guide FATo The Fat and Sodiumin was taken from Heart Briefs, The American Heart Association,Almeda County Chapter, Oakland, CA. Page 15 At 1 1 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Special Issue: Choosing Crackers Selecting a cracker can be a real challenge. Some of the lower fat crackers arehigh in sodium, and some of the lower sodium crackers are high in fat. Depending uponyour dietary concerns, you may be searching for a cracker that is low in both.Very few brands of crackers have nutrition labels to tell you how much sodium(salt) or fat a cracker contains. Instead, most brands have ingredient labels that only tellyou whether or not a productcontains sodium (salt) or fat. The chart on the next pageranks different crackers by the grams of fat they contain. The milligrams of sodium theycontain are provided in the column to the right. Use this chart to help you select the bestcracker for you and your family and for the children in your care. Remember these basicguidelines for fat and sodium intake:Recommended fat consumption: No more than 30% of calories over a period of afew days. (Children under 2 need more fat than adults.

As a result, foodmanufacturers are producing food products whichcontain less sodium than before. The food labelsused to distinguish these lower sodium foods canbe misleading and confusing.The Food and Drug Administration hastried to make sodium labels a little easier tounderstand by developing standard meanings forsome of the terms we see on the labels. Here arethose standard definitions for terms used toindicate less sodium.Reduced Sodium:The food item has 75% less sodium than thefood it replaces.Low Sodium:The food item has a maximum of 140 milli-grams (mgs.) of sodium per serving.Very Low Sodium:The food item has no more than 35mg ofsodium per serving.Sodium-Free:The food item has less than 5mg of sodium perserving. Page 101 Understanding the Dietary Guidelines Special Issue: High BloodPressure About one in four adults in the United States will develop high bloodpressure. Currently there is no sure way to predict exactly who these people will be.However, researchers have identified certain factors that increase a person's risk todevelop high blood pressure. High sodium intake, family history, and obesity are threesuch factors. In addition, researchers have found that African-Americans are more likelyto develop high blood pressure than Caucasians.Lowering sodium intake will usually help people at risk avoid developinghigh blood pressure. It may also help lower blood pressure for those who have alreadydeveloped it.Have your blood pressure checked. Many pharmacies and some grocery storesnow have equipment thatwill allow you to check your blood pressure for free. Thisequipment will not only read your blood pressure, but will tell you if it is below normal,normal, or above normal. In addition, the Red Cross and other health organizationsfrequently sponsor health fairs where free blood pressure checks are done. Blood pressurechecks are quick and painless.If you have not recently checked your blood pressure, do so.If your blood pressure is high, consult a doctor about diet and medication.If your blood pressure is normal, help keep it that way:maintain a healthy weight,exercise regularly,use less salt and sodium. 147 Page 102 CHAPTER 3 CHANGING YOUR DIET:MAKINGTHEDIETARY GUIDELINESWORKFORYou Changing Your Diet In the Introduction you will read about:the purpose for changing your diet page 2barriers to changepage 2 149Page 1This manual was made possible by an educational grant from Nestle USA, Inc. toSave The Children Child Care Support Center. Changing Your Diet Now that you have a basic understandingof the dietary guidelines, the next step is to put thatinformation to use by following the dietary guide-lines in preparing meals and snacks. We don'texpect, however, that you remembered every-thing that you learned about each dietary guide-line. When you have questions or are not sureabout a guideline, refer back to the informa-tion provided in the previous chapter.The information in this chapter will helpyou to:1. Evaluate your diet and the foods you servein terms of the dietary guidelines2. Set your goals or decide what changes youwish to make in your diet3. Develop a plan for reachin; your goals ormaking those changes.However, before you begin this process, itis important that you understand the overall pur-pose of changing your diet, as well as some basicinformation about how to be successful in makingchanges.The Purpose of Changing Your DietThe purpose of changing your diet isimprovement, not perfection. As a family daycare provider with many responsibilities and du-ties, it would be not only unwise, but impossiblefor you to focus all your energies on feeding thechildren. Feeding is very important, but there arealso many other important tasks that you mustperform. In addition, perfection is impossible.You may be great but you are still only human.That means that occasionally you will be just tootired, too busy, or too tempted by not-so-nutri-tious foods to serve the most nutritious meals orsnacks. Know ahead of time that you will occa-sionally go back to your old not-as-nutritiousways of eating and cooking. Allow yourself tobackslide a little, but keep aiming towardimprovement. And give yourself credit formaldng the effort.A second point to remember is that thedietary guidelines apply to diets as e whole, notto any particular food or meal, or even to aday's meals. Not every food you serve, or mealor snack you serve, will fit these guidelines. Asone example, think about birthday cakes. Theyare usually high in fat and sugar and offer fewnutrients.There are ways in which you canchange your recipe for birthday cake that willmake it more nutritious, or you could serve a morenutritious food to celebrate a birthday. Both ofthese are good ideas. However, the occasionalbirthday cake is not our biggest concern when weattempt to change our diets. Most of us do not eatbirthday cakes often enough for the more nutri-tious recipe to make a big difference in our overalldiets.The changes that will make the biggestdifference in our diets are usually the smallchanges in the foods served often. Every mealmight .not fit the guidelines perfectly, but ifoverall you are reducing fat, sugar, and salt,serving a larger variety of foods, and servingmore vegetables and fruits, you are makingdietary changes that are nutritionally impor-tant.These are the kinds of changes thatshould be the focus of your energy.Barriers to ChangeIt might just be human nature, but one ofthe first things most of us do when we think aboutchange is to think of all of the reasons why we cannot or should not change. So before we go anyfurther, let's address S common reasons peoplegive for resisting changes in their diets. Oncewe put these excuses to rest, we can move on tothe task of making change successful. Page 21 5 0 Reason Number 1: I have cooked and eatenthis way all my life. Why should I changenow?The Response:We now know that 6 out of the 10 majordiseases in the United States, including heartdisease and high blood pressure, are- dietrelated. Improving your diet may improveyour health or lower your risk of developinga diet related disease. Providing childrenwith a healthy diet not only has a posidveimpact on their health while they are young,but it will also influence their food prefer-ences and eating habits throughout theirlives.Reason Number 2: I'm on a tight budget.Won't this new way of eating cost more?The Response:No. Lefs look briefly at each dietary re-quirement to answer this question.1. Eat a variety of foods.The cost of increasing variety depends onwhat new foods you add to your diet. Thereis certainly no reason why increasing vari-ety means increasing cost.2. Maintain a healthy weight.The major cause of obesity among childrenis lack of exercise. Exercise is free. Specialdiet programs are sometimes expensive, butthey are not usually recommended for chil-dren or adults. The best way to maintain ahealthy weight is to eat a healthy diet and toget plenty of exercise.3. Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat,and cholesterol.There are several ways to limit your fat,saturated fat, and cholesterol intake. Someof them are more costly, but you need notchoose those ways. Eating more non-meatChanging Your Diet sources of protein, like dry beans and grains,is a good way to reduce both the fat in yourdiet and your grocery expenses.4. Eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, andgrain products.Eating more vegetables, fruits, and grainproducts need not be more expensive ei-ther. Most vegetables and fruits are rela-tively inexpensive. Grains also tend to beinexpensive. If you are using grain as aprotein substitute, and therefore using lessmeat, you will save money.5. Avoid too much sugar.Sweet snacks. desserts, and cereals tend tobe expensive.In most cases the morenutritious snacks like fresh fruits and veg-etables, crackers, and cheese are cheaper.6. Avoid too much salt or sodium.Some processed foods that are labeled \"low-sodium\" are more expensive than theirhigher sodium versions. You don't have topurchase these to lower your sodium in-take. In some cases you may choose to; inother cases you may choose from the manyother options for lowering your sodiumintake. For example, rather than buyingcanned vegetables, buy frozen vegetables.These are no more expensive, and if youbuy the larger bags of frozen vegetables,you will probably save *noney.Reason Number 3: It takes too much time toprepare healthful foods.The Response:It should not take any more time to prepare ahealthy meal . You may need to invest a littleextra time initially to learn things like newways to prepare foods andhow to read foodlabels, but we think that the benefits will beworth the investment. Page 31 51 Changing Your Diet Reason Number 4: I don't want to give up myfavorite foods.I doubt my family and thechildren I care for will like this new diet, andI probably won't like it either.The Response:First, you do not have to give up yourfavorite foods to improve your diet. Thereare other options, like eating them less oftenor eating smaller portions. Second, it sel-dom takes a radical change in your diet toimprove its nutritional quality. Some of thechanges you make in recipes and meals willnot even be noticed. However, if you areintroducing noticeable changes in meals orrecipes, these suggestions will help you besuccessful.Introduce new foods or recipe changesslowly. Don't serve a meal in whichevery food is new or prepared differ-ently.Involve children in the selection and/orpreparation of new foods.Don't force diners to eat all of the newfood. Just encourage them to taste it.Don't bribe diners by saying things like\"if you eat all of the new food, you'll getdessert.\" This emphasizes one food overanother.Don't get discouraged. You may haveto offer a food or recipe several timesbefore people begin to like it.You will have to judge for yourself,based on what you know about the individualsyou cook for, how to approach changing reci-pes and introducing new foods. However, ifyou change your diet gradually, few people,including yourself, will reject the change.Reason Number 5: Change is hard. I willprobably fail.The Response:You can change successfully. Change isnot easy for most of us. But then many of us makeit much harder than it has to be. We tend to setunrealistic goals, or adopt someone else's goalswhich may be realistic for them, but are unrealis-tic for us. Then when we fail, we get angry withourselves. Each time we try and fail, we have lessconfidence in our ability to succeed. No wonderchange becomes something we dread. However,with the right approach, change can be excitingand successful. The following guidelines willhelp.1. Make gradual changes. Take small stepsand allow yourself to experience success.If you make dietary changes gradually,you are more likely to succeed at permanentlychanging your diet. If changes are sudden, andespecially if they mean eliminating or changingfavorite recipes while introducing many new onesat once, they will not be well-received by you orthe children in your care. We typically like whatwe are accustomed to best. Rapid change is toodisruptive, too noticeable, too different. If youattempt to change too quickly, you and your kidsmay dislike the new diet and abandon your changeefforts altogether.2. Set reasonable goals.In setting your goals, don't focus just onwhere you ultimately want to be. Consider yourstarting point.Set goals you think you canachieve even if you think they are quite adistance from where you eventually hope to be.Once you make this first step, strive to go further.Make the next step a little more difficult. You'llget there eventually, and with less trouble and abigger chance at staying there. (There will bemore on setting goals later in this section.) Page 41 5 2 3. Develop a plan for reaching your goals.Developing a good plan increases yourchance of success. As you develop a plan, be asspecific as possible about how you will meet yourgoals. Identify the behavior you want to exhibit,and when that behavior is appropriate. If you can,specify how often or how much. Your goals won'tseem so big when you know exactly what behav-ior it will take to reach them. (This will bediscussed in more detail later in this section.)4. Reward yourself, your family, and thechildren in your care - but not with food.Changing Your Diet Success is one of the best rewards for yourchange efforts. You will be encouraged and readyto tty for the next goal. However, extra rewardsfor achievements and for efforts won't hurt. Picksomething other than food as the reward. Forexample, spend extra time at an activity you andthe children find enjoyable. Also pick an extrareward for yourself, perhaps one that does notinvolve the children. Rewards emphasize thatyou and the children have been successful, andthis is always a good feeling. Remember, the goalis improvement, not perfection. With each ac-complishment, no matter how small it mayseem in relation to where you would ultimatelylike to be, you have made an important step.Rewards will be well-deserved.

You must bepersonally committed to achieving your goals.Without this commitment, you have little chancefor success.Look back at your evaluation of yourdiet. What would be good goals for you? Doyou need to lower your cholesterol intake? Doyou need to increase the variety of vegetables youserve? Do you need to serve healthier snacks?Based on your evaluation of your diet,pick at least 4 dietary goals, more if you wouldlike. They may include areas where you need a lotof improvement and areas where you need just alittle improvement. Don't be concerned at thispoint with which goal you will pursue first, or howyou will reach the goal. What matters now isidentifying them. As you identify each goal, listit in the space provided below. My dietary goals are:Goal_ : Goal_ : Goal: Goal: Additional Goals : Page 34 Now that you have identified your goals,it is time to decide which goal or goals you willpursue first. In decidingwhich goal or goals topursue first, consider both where you need themost improvement and where you have thegreatest chance for success. Success is espe-cially important in the beginning so you may wantto select a goal (or goals) that you feel you canachieve.Often the area where you feel you have thegreatest chance at success and the area where youhave the biggest problem are not the same. As anexample, let's say that too much fat, saturated fat,and cholesterol may be your biggest problem, butit may also involve ways of cooking ot. eatinghabits that are the hardest for you to break. On theother hand, you may have found that you also eattoo much salt or sodium.Lowering your salt orsodium intake may seem like an easier goal forChanging Your Diet you to achieve. You may want to begin there andstrive for lowering fat, saturated fat, and choles-terol next. This will give you a better chance toexperience success, and prove to yourself that youcan change your diet.You can choose as many goals as youlike, and if you want to tackle ycar biggestproblem first, even though it may be the mostdifficult to reach, that is your choice. You are thebest judge of your own abilities. But remember,all you are selecting here is a starting point.Eventually you can pursue all of the goals youhave identified for yourself.After you have chosen the goal or goalsyou will pursue first, make a note. Go back toyour list on page 31 and number your goals in theorder you plan to pursue them. Now you areready to develop a plan for meeting your goals. Page 35 Changing Your Diet In this section you will learn how to:develop a plan to meet your personal dietary goals1page 38 1 7 7 Page 37 Changing Your Diet In developing a plan to meet your goals,be as specific as possible. State what you will do,and where appropriate, how often. Perhaps thebest way to explain how to develop a plan, is topresent an example.Let's say you have evaluated your diet,and/or the diets you provide the children andfound that one of your biggest problems is thatyou use too much sodium or salt. As a result, youdecided that your first goal will be to reduce yoursodium or salt. You might want to be morespecific and say how much salt or sodium youwish to consume each day. In this case your goalmight be to reduce your salt or sGzli um intake tono more than 4,500 milligrams per day. (4,500milligrams is above the 1,100 to 3,300 milligramsrecommended in the dietary guidelines. How-ever, if your usual level is approximately 5,500milligrams a day, it is a reduction and a reasonablefirst step. )You may not want to be so concerned withmeasuring and keeping track of your sodiumconsumption. That is OK. Measuring is notsomething you need to do on a regular basis.Once you have an idea of how much sodium orsalt you consume and what foods or whatbehaviors are contributing to the sodium inyour diet, you can develop a plan to reduce itwithout measuring or keeping track.As we have said, we are trying for gradualchange. Drastically reducing your intake to therecommended level could lead to failure. Re-gardless of your goal, you have to start whereyou are and reduce your intake over time.After you have become comfortable with a lowerlevel of salt intake and you no longer have thedesire to add more salt to foods or crave saltyfoods, you can try to reduce it even further.Eventually you will reach the level you desire.Now you need a specific plan for howyou will change your diet to meet this goal. Youmight examine your diet for the past week, orreview the notes you took in evaluating your diet,and identify the foods and behaviors that contrib-ute sodium to your diet. Perhaps you have foundone or more of the following:1. You tend to eat canned vegetables, soupsand stew frequently. They contain highlevels of sodium.2. You add salt to your foods at the table,usually without even tasting them.3. You often cook with seasonings like onionsalt, garlic salt, and bouillon.4. You serve cheese and frankfurters weekly.Based on this evaluation, you may de-velop the following plan for reducing your saltintake. Page 381. You will serve fresh or frozen vegetablesinstead of canned and not serve cannedsoup more than once every other week.2. You will not put the salt shaker on the tableand will always taste before salting.3. You will switch from garlic and onion saltto garlic and onion powder, try to use morefresh onion and garlic, and experimentwith other spices and herbs. You will useless bouillon and will try cooking withjuices and making your own stock. (Whenyou make your own stock, be sure to chillit and skim off the fat before using orfreezing it.) 178 4. You will serve cheese and frankfurters nomore than once every other week and willselect low sodium versions when they areavailable.In this example we have been very spe-cific about the problem and what we intend todo about it. Notice that in most cases, whenfoods items were limited, we were specificabout how many times a week we would eat orserve them. This makes it easy to monitor ourprogress and increases our chance of success.What follows in the next section aremany suggestions of specific things you can doto reach your dietary goals. The suggestionsyou pick from this list, alon2 with those you maythink of on yourown, will become your plan. Youare not expected to adopt all of the suggestions.You are simply to choose from this long list theones that seem reasonable to you. Place a checkmark next to the ones you select so that they willbe easy to spot when you wish to refer back tothem.The suggestions are organized uth:ereach dietary guideline. So, for example, if youare developing a plan for your goal of loweringChanging Your Diet your fat intake, turn to the section with the head-ing \"To lower your fat, saturated fat and choles-terol, choose from these suggestions.\" The sug-gestions are further divided by:1. Suggestions related to selecting foods2. Suggestions related to cooking or prepar-ing foods3. Suggesfions related to changing recipes.Some of you may find one category of sugges-tions more useful and may choose suggestions foryour plan from that category only. Others maychoose useful suggestions from each of the cat-egories.Remember, there are many ways toimprove your diet. And what seems reasonableto one person, may seem unreasonable to another.Choose the suggestions that will work best foryou and add some of your own.Following the list of suggestions, spaceis provided on pages 69 through 77 for you towrite each goal from page 31 and the plan youdevelop for reaching it. 19Page 9 IChanging Your Diet D00 This section contains:Suggestions tor adding varietya story about how oneprovider promotes varietysuggestions for lowering fat, saturated fat and cholesterola story about how oneprovider lowers fat and cholesterolsuggestions for increasing starch and fibera story about how oneprovider increases starch and fibersuggestions for lowering sugara story about how oneprovider lowers sugarsuggestions for lowering salt and sodiuma story about how oneprovider lowers salt and storyspace for information on:modifying recipespage 78cooking to conserve nutrients page 79 Changing Your Diet 01. To add vadety; pick from these s'uggestions: Try some of the flavored pastas, such as spinach noodles or whole-wheat spaghetti.Pasta also comes in a variety of shapes that children enjoy. This can add interest to yourmeals.Try brown rice instead of white rice to add texture, fiber, and flavor to many dishes.When you bake breads from scratch, use enriched or whole-grain flours. Othersubstitutes that will add variety in terms of taste and texture are oatmeal, pumpernickel,rye, and cornmeal products.Add extra vegetables to soups, stews, casseroles and pasta sauces. Try using thisopportunity to introduce new vegetables.Add fruits to baked goods like muffins and breads.Substitute dry beans and dry peas for some or all of the meat in meat dishes likecasseroles and meat sauces.Add vegetables, fruits, and even a small amount of beans, to tossed salads. Trymaking pasta salads and fruit salads.Cut up vegetables and serve them raw either as a snack or with the meal. Try servingthem with a lowfat dip or spread.When you plan menus to increase variety, consider serving both hot and cold foods,creamy and crunchy, spicy and mild.Think about ways you can create variety in color. 1 11, ate 43 Changing Your Diet . . ..,Linda is relatively new to family child care. She has had her own .family child care home for about a year. She began her career as a family childcare provider when she had a difficult time finding quality child care for heryoungest child. Linda has 4 children of her own. In her child care home shecares for 6 children plus an additional 2 in after-school care. Feeding themall can be time-consuming and expensive. According to Linda, it takes goodplanning and imagination. .o eeIt is easy to see the effect of Linda's childhood in the way she feeds and . cares for her child care 'children. Linda grew up on a farm where there wereno convenience foods. Instead, the garden supplied her family with lots offresh vegetables in the summer and a freezer stocked with enough vegetablesto last through the winter. Her mother and grandmother loved to cook. The 'table was always set with pretty dishes and the family gathered to enjoy big .meals with lots ofvariety. As Linda describes it, \"Eating was the family social.hour.\" Linda says her mother and grandmother were not educated, but theywere creative. They may not have intentionally set out to serve Linda anutritious variety of foods, or even realized how important variety was, buther mother and grandmother provided her with a healthy diet and taught herto appreciate it. Now Linda is passing that lesson on to the children in her. family child care home.Linda admits that she was somewhat alarmed by the diets of some ofthe children she cares for when they first began coming to her family child ..t care home. She describes their diets as the \"factory worker's lunchbox,\" los. of sandwiches, and convenience foods, chips, and Little Debbies for dessert.Two of the children had never even tasted an orange or strawberry or melonbefore. The only fruits they had tried were apples and bananas. Two otherswere having coke and cheetos for breakfast until Linda offered to feed thembreakfast each morning. Most of the children Linda cares for are from lowincome families, some of them from single parent homes. One single motherwhose 2 daughters are in Linda's day care, works full time at a factoryjob and.attends night classes at the local college. Linda recognizes the challenges ofworking full-time and trying to meet all of the needs of a family. And thefamilies of the children Linda ;.a.res for appreciate Linda's efforts to providetheir children with the nutrients and calories they need. According to Linda,\"If I don't feed these kids what they need, they may not get it.\"4. Page 441 R 2 Changing Your Diet 9 0OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Linda offered many good ideas about introducing children toa vaeety of foods. Here arethree suggestions from Linda.1. Introduce children to new foods when they are hungry.Linda found that when th , children were hungry they were more. . .willing to try new foods. In Linda's experience, one of the best times to. . . introduce a new food to the children is when lunch is being prepared. ..According to Linda, preparing lunch and watching children is sometimes a . . .two person job. The closer the food is to being ready, the hungrier, moreexcited, and sometimes crankier the children get. And what Linda needs..most during these times is a few minutes of quiet so that she can finis . h the. preparation and get the meal on the table. One way she achieves this is by4.ri.offeng the children nutritious appetizers. For example, sometimes she.4... .serves vegetable and fruitslices, including some they have not tried before. .She prepares the appetizer tray earlier in the day and refrigerates it until a. .. .few minutes before lunch. These appetizers are a nutritious way to keep the . .children busy so she can finish preparing lunch in peace.. . 4, . 2. Make new foods fir--Linda found that some of the children in her care had never tried..pineapple or cantaloupe. When she first offered it to thflra they would venture . .a smell but that wasabout all. When she cut the fruits into bite size pieces, . .had the children sit in a circle cn the floor, presented them with a \"party tray,\" .and invit,ed them to eat with their fingers, she got different results. Pineapple.and cantaloupe became fun. They tried it and liked it. (If you try this, make4, ..4.sure the fruits are cut intothe right size chunks so that the children do not. .choke on them. See the information on Preventing Choking in chapter #1 for. 4. . .more information.) . . .3. Get the children involved. 0Getting the children to try different vegetables can sometimes be a . .problem. Linda found she was more successful when she involved the.4children somehow in food preparation. Some of the ways she gets them . . involved is to let them help wash the vegetables, push the buttons on the food. Oprocessor, or turn the mixerbowl. They even consider it a treat to wash their.plastic dishes. Linda admits that she sometimes has to mop up a little.e e.4, hildr splashed water, and sometimes wipe down the cabinets, but the cen.enjoy helping. It makes them feel like they are important contributors and . . .they are . . Page Diet 0 .hLinda is also fortunate toave a vegetable garden in her backyard. a The children love to help. Their favorite job is shucking the corn, espedallypulling out the silks. One boy called this \"pulling the corn's hair out.\" Lindanoticed that once they saw where foods came from, they were eager to discoverhow they tasted. After one season in the garden, some ofthe children who hadrefused to eat cucumbers decided that they liked them. Linda also lets eachchild have his/her own tomato plant. When they were putting the cagesarotmd the plants, one of the girls asked \"But why do we have to lock them .up?\"Linda cares about the quality of the foods she serves and has manygood ideas. But how does she do it on a tight schedule and a tight budget? Sheoffered these suggestions for saving time and money. .. . 1. When you prepare lunch for the children, cook enough for yourown family's dinner.. .. 2. Make your own convenience foods. Set aside one day E .eek for major.cooking. Put enough food for one meal in a container and freeze it. All you . have to do is thaw it out, warm it up, and it's ready to serve.3. Save what you can to use later. This applies to broths, and leftovervegetables that can be frozen and used later in soups, stews or casseroles.Linda even bones her own chicken breasts and uses the bones to make broth.Before you throw leftovers away consider: can it be safely stored for later use?And what are the ways I might use it? Remember: Food stored improp-erly can be a health hazard. A helpful hint: label and date frozen foods so .you know what is in the freezer and how long it has been there. You might. . also want to date food items you place in the refrigerator. (Read the chapter .. on Protecting Children's Health for more information.) .4. Buy the less expensive store brands when you are not sacrificing .quality. Linda discovered that for some food items, the quality of the store .brand was not as good as the quality of the more expensive major brand. Inthese cases she switched back to the major brand. But when the quality is as.good, Linda chooses to save money.n 1 rA Page 46 Changing Your Did OOOOO0(9 OOOOOilt OOOOOOOOOOOOOO .5. Linda pointed out that when you think about costs, you have toconsider how many servings you can get from a food item. When shebegan figuring costs in this manner, she discovered some things thatsurprised her. For example, a fresh cantaloupe or pineapple can providemany servings and is usuallycheaper per serving than an orange, and it isboth less expensive and more nutritious than canned fruit.Linda knows she has improved the diet of some of her day carechildren. In some cases she has also influenced their family's eating habits.Some mothers report their children requesting foods that they had assuniedthe children would not like, so they had never even offered them. Linda'sfavorite story regarding the way she has influenced family eating patternscomes from the mother of a boy in her day care. Linda never fries foods .anymore. When she serves pork chops, she pan broils them. One child, whosemother batters and fries her pork chops, taught his mother a lesson inlowering fat without even realizing it. As she was preparing pork chops fortheir dinner, the young boy objected to her high fat cooking method. Hewanted his pork chops \"naked like Miss Linda makes them.\". .. Page 47 Changing Your Diet .-I. A. Select foods wisely.Read the food labels carefully to determine both the amount and type of fat presentin foods.Choose lower-fat cheeses such as feta, neufchatel and mozzarella of high-fatones such as Swiss or cheddar.Use plain lowfat or nonfat yogurt seasoned with herbs, grated parmesan cheeseor whipped lowfat cottage cheese with a little lemon juice or herbs as toppings forfoods like potatoes and rice instead of butter, margarine, gravy, and sour cream. Ifyogurt is substituted in a sauce that is to be heated, add 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to1 cup of yogurt to prevent separation.Serve vegetable and broth-based soups instead of cream-based soups.Avoid fat-rich pastries and rich creamy desserts. Try angel food cake, frozen fruitbars, fresh fruit or lowfat frozen yogurt instead.Choose tuna packed in water rather then oil.Limit use of butter, lard and lard based shortenings, heavily hydrogenated fats(some margarines), and foods containing palm and coconut oils. Instead choosemargarine in which liquid vegetable oil is the first ingredient and choose vegetable oilslike canola, corn, sunflower, soybean, safflower and olive oils.Avoid fat rich meats, organ meats and egg yolks. Choose lean meats, fish, poultrywith the skin removed, and dry beans and peas as protein sources.Avoid high-fat dairy products such as whole milk, cream, sour cream, and mostcheeses. Choose skim or 1% milk except when serving children. Never give reducedfat milk to children under two. Substitute plain nonfat or lowfat yogurt for sourcream, and select lowfat cheeses.Avoid the high-fat, breaded and deep fried foods.Select lean meats like chicken, turkey, fish, lean beef cuts (top round, eye of round, Page 49 Changing Your Diet top loin and sirloin, lean hamburger) and lean pork cuts (tenderloin, loin, chops, ham).The \"select\" grade cuts are the leanest grade. If \"select\" grade cuts are not available,choose \"choice\" grade. \"Ptime\" grade is the fattest. Avoid it if possible. Alwaysremove the skin from chicken and turkey.Select leaner ground beef. Generally the lower the price and the lighter the color, themore fat has been ground up with the meat. If you don't want to pay extra for groundbeef with less fat, remove excess fat after cooking by draining the meat.B. Cook and/or prepare foods in ways that reduce fat. Do not add unnecessaryfat.Do not season vegetables with salt pork, bacon drippings or fatback. If thisseasoning is difficult for you to give up completely, try cutting down on the fat whilekeeping the flavor. Make the meat broth ahead of time and refrigerate to chill. The fatwill come to the top and you can easily remove it. This will give you a tasty fat-free,or at least lower-fat, broth to use in cooking vegetables like greens.Do not add butter or margarine to vegetables. Instead try lemon juices, herbs, andspices. Saute or stir-fry with little fat or use water, wine, or broth.Use fat free cooking methods like broiling, baking, grilling, poaching, steaming, orboiling rather then frying.In addition to choosing lean meats, it is important to cook meats in a way that does notadd fat. Bake, broil, or stew, instead of frying. Also, leaner meats may be tougher,and therefore harder for young children to chew. You may need to cook them longeror differently, for example with moist heat or steam, to make them more tender.Trim visible fat from meats before cooking and remove skin from poultry. To keepskinned poultry moist while baking, wrap in aluminum foil.Prepare meat, poultry, or fish without breading or batter. Coatings absorb fat.Brown ground meats without adding fat. Drain off fat before mixing in otheringredients.Place meat on a rack when roasting, broiling, or braising so that the fat can drainaway from the meat.Cook with little or no added fat. Use nonstick pans or nonstick vegetable sprays.Baste with unsalted broth, unsalted tomato juice, or fruit juice rather thandrippings. Page 50 Changing Your Diet To brown rolls without adding fat, brush them with egg white or skim or lowfatmilk instead of butter.Chill drippings and broth and remove fat before making gravies, soups, andsauces.To avoid lumps, mix thickener (flour or cornstarch) with cold liquidingredients (unsalted broth, water, fruit juice) before heating. This mixes best whenyou use an electric blender.Chill soups, gravies and stews, and skim off the hardened fat before reheating toserve.Salt and oil are not necessary when cooking pasta, rice, and hot cereals. Try cookingpasta or rice in unsalted broth or unsalted tomato juice.C. Modify high fat recipes to reduce the fat or try new recipes for lowfat ornonfat substitutes.Make your own lowfat, low-sodium condiments. For example, making your ownsalsa by mixing diced fresh or \"no-salt-added\" canned tomatoes with diced onions,green peppers, and chilies.Make your own salad dressings. Creamy dressings can be made with plain lowfatyogurt rather than sour cream or mayonnaise. Decrease the proportion of oil in home-made oil based salad dressing like Italian dressing. Try 1/3 cup of oil to 2/3 cup ofvinegar. Lowfat cottage cheese or buttermilk seasoned with herbs and spices alsomakes a lowfat dressing.When making casseroles, be moderate in your use of high-fat crumb toppings.Make the meat, poultry, or fish in main dishes and casseroles go farther bycombining them with pasta, rice, and other grains, or vegetables.When making egg dishes, use only one egg yolk per serving. Make larger servingsof dishes like scrambled eggs by adding extra egg whites. When making quickbreads, cookies and c2kes, use two egg whites in place of each whole egg. In somerecipes, simply decrease the twal number of eggs. This is especially true if the fat andsugar also are decreased in the recipe.Try substituting dry beans or dry peas for some or all of the meat, poultry, or fishin some dishes.When making pasta sauces, don't add oil. Fat is not a necessary ingredient. Page sI r). 8 Changing Your Diet When baking chocolate desserts, use 3 tablespoons of cocoa in place of each ounceof baking chocolate. If fat is needed to replace the fat in chocolate in baked goods,use 1 tablespoon or less of a vegetable oil or a margarine in which the fust ingredienton the ingredient label is a liquid oil (as opposed to a hydrogenated fat).In baked products, reduce fat by I/4 to 113. For example, if a recipe calls for 1 cupshortening, try 2/3 cup oil. This works best in quick breads, muffins, and cookies. Theminimum amount of fat for muffins, quick breads, and biscuits is 1 to 2 tablespoons percup of flour. The minimum amount of fat for cakes is 2 tablespoons per cup of flour.Some yeast breads, such as english muffins and french bread, can be made without anyfat.Pureed fruits, especially pureed prunes, can be substituted for the fat (shorteningor butter) in cakes and cookies. You simply replace the fat with an equal amount ofpureed fruit.Use skim or lowfat milk when making cream soups. For extra richness, tryevaporated skim milk.A HINT ABOUT REDUCING FAT AND SUGAR IN REOPES:Sugars and fat affect the tenderness and volume of baked products. Sugars also add to the flavor.It is important to have the right balance of ingredients. You can often use less of both fat and sugar andcan sometimes eliminate them and stir. have a good tasting product. You will find more about this in thesupporting information on Modifying Recipes: Understanding the Purpose of 4 Key Ingredients, page78 in this chapter. Page 52 Changing Your Diet...... .. . One Provider's . .. .e.Maria has been a family child care provider for a long time, but ite. . . .wasn't until recently that she became concerned with the amount of fat and .cholesterol in the foods she prepares for the children in her care. Both her . .. .husband and her 2 children have high-cholesterol which increases their risk . . . for heart disease. In their cases, the condition is partially hereditary and the. . .doctor has put them on medication. Still they can help to reduce their risk of..heart disease by lowering the fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol in their diets. ..The good eating habits Maria is learning as a result of her concerns for her .family's health have also meant healthier diets for the children in her family. .day care home.. . . . .Maria has an important job in meeting the different dietary needs of . . .4.her family and the children in her day care. Her family members have a . .medical condition that requires a very restricted fat, saturated fat, and . . 4,cholesterol intake. However, this kind oflowfat diet would not be good for the . . . children in her day care. They need an adequate amount of fat in their diets4, . .in order to grow and develop properly. In addition, Maria is caring for one 16 . . .. month old. He needs even more fat than the older children. Maria knows that . . . lowering fat in the diets of children under two can be dangerous. Althoughthis sounds like quite a challenge, Maria assured me \"it's not as tough as it. .sounds.\" . . . . . .To Maria, reducing fat, saturated fat and cholesterol is a balancing act. 0 . . .She has a goal for her family's fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol consumption .and she decides where and how to limit fat and cholesterol in order to reach . .. .it. Occasionally Maria serves a food relatively high in fat and cholesterol. For . . example, Maria and her family enjoy steaks on special occasions. But now . instead of having a baked potato covered with butter and sour cream with. . .their steak, they have wild rice and a green salad with low-fat no cholesterolsalad dressing. In other words, if Maria serves a high fat food item, she makes . .. .sure the other foods on the menu are low enough in fat and cholesterol to. .make up for it. . . . . . .In addition to performing this balancing act with her family's diet,. . . Maria says she also makes sure her family's fat grams really count. Maria put .it this way, \"if you only have a certain number of fat grams to consume, you. 4,want them to come from foods you really like.\" Maria gave \"real mayonnaise\". . .as an example. Both she and her husband prefer the taste of the \"real thing,\" . .e Page 5390 Changing Your Diet but they use it selectively. She uses low-cholesterol mayonnaise in her potatosalad and the \"real mayonnaise\" on sandwiches. As Maria explained, if you.use the real mayonnaise in potato salad, you get a lot of fat and cholesterol.And with all of the other ingredients in her potato salad, the taste of the.mayonnaise is hardly noticed. In this case she and her family would rather use . . . .their limited amount of fat and cholesterol for sandwiches. As long as they do . .not exceed their goal for fat and cholesterol consumption, how they limit their.4, .fat and cholesterol is their choice.. . .4.Maria does not limit the fat in her day care children's diet in the same . .way she limits it in her family's diet. She avoids high-fat, high-sugar foods . .like doughnuts which have little nutritional value. She has also stopped . . ..frying foods and has reduced high fat toppings like butter, sour cream and . cream cheese. However, Maria is careful not to limit fat too much in thechildren's diets. For example, while her family eats the reduced fat cheeses. . .and only drinks skim milk, the children in her day care home always get .whole milk and regular cheese. . .Maria realizes that the foods she offers the children she cares for will. . have a big effect on the food preferences they develop. And her family's. ..problem with high cholesterol has made her realize just how important that .. i,is. Some of the parents of the children in her care have long commutes to andfrom work. Maria knows they are usually tired at the end of the day and . .sometimes drive through a fast food restaurant to buy the child dinner. Maria . feels that because they know their child is getting a healthy diet while in her..care, they can be more comfortable making those kind of choices. They canrest assured that she is providing their children a healthy diet and teachir. g.them good eating habits in the process... . Page 54 Changing Your Diet 3. To increase yourintake of starch and f ber,pick from these suggestitms. A. Select good sources of starch and fiber.Choose foods that are good sources of fiber and starch such as whole-grain breadsand cereals, fruits, vegetables, and dry beans and peas.Replace snacks high in fat and sugar with ones high in fiber and starch. Forexample, cut up and serve raw fresh vegetables and fruit for snacks.For added fiber, replace fruit juice with fresh fruit.Processed, refined, or \"instant\" foods have less fiber than their original form.Choose the original, for example, the old-fashioned type of oatmeal, rather than theinstant type. Try using a crock pot with the old-fashioned oatmeal and let it cookovernight. This will save you time, the crock pot will be easy to clean, and breakfastwill be ready when you are.B. Cook or serve in ways that save vitamins and do not destroy fiber. Some methods of preparing vegetables cook many of the vitamins and minerals away.Pounding, grinding, overcooking, or mashing can destroy the fiber in foods. Servefruits raw. Serve vegetables raw when you can, or try steaming either in a pot withlittle water, or in the microwave. Vegetables should be brightly colored and crispafter cooking.Leave the skins or peelings on fruits and vegetables when possible. For example,don't peel apples or pears. When making mashed potatoes, leave the peelings on whenyou cook and mash them. Also try serving the peelings of baked potatoes.C. Modify recipes to add more starch and fiber.Add fruits to muffins, pancakes, salads, and desserts.Add dry beans or dry peas as a protein substitute for part or all of the meat in soups,pasta sauces and other main dishes. Page I q 2 Changing Your Diet Add extra vegetables to stews, soups, casseroles, quiche fillings, salads and pastadishes.Substitute waole-wheat flour for white flour. Whole-wheat flour can usually besubstitutsti for up to 1/2 of the all-purpose flour called for in a recipe. For example,if a recipe calls for 2 cups of all-purpose flour, try 1 cup of all-purpose flour and 1 cupof whole wheat flour. When completely substituting whole-wheat for white flour, use7/8 cup whole-wheat flour for 1 cup of white flour. 1 93Page 56 Changing Your Diet 410OOOOOOOOOOOO555..tOne Provider's Sory . . . .Mary admits that her decision to pursue a career as a family day care .provider surprised everyone, even herself. But as the oldest child of 8, caringh for children was second nature to er.Mary had been a provider for three years when a friend mentioned thatthe community college near her home was offering an associate degree inchild development. The idea of getting an associate degree both excited and . frightened Mary. She looked forward to what she might learn, but at the same. . time she wondered where she would find the time to study. Mary decided toaccept the challenge. She met with the school counselor and worked out a.part-time class schedule that she thought she could handle. In September of1989, Mary began working toward her Associate degree ir child develop- . ment.Maryloved school and discovered that she was learning much more . .than she had anticipated. She also realized what a demanding job she hadbeen doing all these years. Being a family day care provider requires manydifferent skills. One has to know about child development, first aid, healthand safety, bookkeeping, filing income taxes and preparing nutritious snacksand meals. During her third semester, Mary took a nutrition course. What.Mary learned in that course surprised her, and made her take a second lookat her childhood diet..Mary says when she looks back on her childhood, she realizes that herfamily was actually pretty poor. Her father worked long hours in a factoryand her mother stayed home to cook and clean and care for the 8 children.Occasionally her mother would take in sewing. As the oldest child, Mary hadmany responsibilities. She helped with the cooking and cleaning, and as sheput it, practically raised the two youngest children. Even though money was . .tight in her femily, Mary recalls that they always had plenty to eat..ryMa's mother was not only good at stretching the family's food dollar,but as it turns out, also provided nutritious meals for the family. Mary saysthey ate a lot of pasta, bread, potatoes, and her mother's great lentil soup. Her.family could not afford to purchase meat very often, so it was served mainlyon special occasions. . Pagesl4 Changing Your Diet OOOOO .Now Mary is married and she and her husband can afford to eat meatas often as they choose. But as Mary learned in her nutrition class, the highcarbohydrate diet she grew up on is actually a very healthy diet. Eating largeportions of meat at every meal provides more protein than people actually . .4.need. In addition, most diets high in meat and dairy products are also highin saturated fat and cholesterol. Saturated fat arld cholesterol contribute to.the risk of heart disease and some forms of cancer..As a result of her nutrition class, Mary has begun to change both her.diet and the meals and snacks she serves to the children in her daycare home..She serves more pasta, rice, whole grain breads, beans, and vegetables. She.even called her mother to get her recipe for lentil soup..Mary admits that she is actually comforted a little by the return to old,.familiar foods and recipes her mother had prepared for her so often. And she.delights in seeing her childhood favorites become favorites among the.children in her day care home-- and in knowing that in the process, she ishelping the children develop healthy eating habits. 1 (15 Page 58 4. To decrease your sugarintake,chobse from these suggestions.Changing Your Diet A. Select foods that are low in sugar and eat foods witii sugar less often.Avoid eating sweets as snacks between meals. Remember: How often you eat sugarand foods containing sugar is as important as how much sugar you eat.Read the food labels carefully for clues on sugar content. Ingedients are listed inorder of the amount the product contains. If the name sugar, sucrose, glucose, maltose,dextrose, lactose, fructose, or syrups appears first, then there is more sugar in theproduct than any other ingredient. If several of these names for sugar are listed on thelabel then the food is probably high in sugar. Select items lower in total sugar whenpossible.Buy fewer of the foods that are high in sugar such as prepared baked goods, candies,and sweet des ;ens.Select fresh fruits or fruits canned in their own juices or in light syrup rather thanheavy syrup.Drink more water, club soda, skim milk and fruit juice and fewer soft drinks, fruitdrinks, soda pops, and punches. Try making fruit juice coolers with equal parts offruit juice and club soda or seltzer. (If you are enrolled in the Child and Adult Care FoodProgram, remember that you will not be reimbursed for serving soft drinks, fruit drinks,soda pops, and punches, or the fruit juice cooler described above. )Use commercially prepared sauces, such as barbecue sauce and ketchup spar-ingly. These are often high in sugars, sodium, or both.B. Don't use sugar in cooking or preparing foods when it is not necessary.Do not add sugar to vegetables, pasta sauces, fruit or fruit salads.C. Modify recipes to reduce the amount of sugar you use.Try putting less sugar in your favorite recipes. Reduce it a small amount at the timeso you can decide what amount is right for you.Add a small amount of vanilla, cinnamon, or nutmt g to foods you bake to enhancethe flavor when you reduce sugars. Page1 ,59q Changing Your Diet Use as little as 1J2 cup sugar per cup of flour in cakes. (Cakes with less sugar maybe more like quick breads than cakes.)In cookies, bars, and cakes, replace 114 of the sugar called for with an equalproportion of nonfat dry milk. For example, if a recipe calls for 1 cup of sugar, use3/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of nonfat dry milk. This reduces calories and increasescalcium, protein and vitamin B2 (riboflavin).Use 1 tablespoon sugar per cup of flour in muffins and quick breads.Use only 1 teaspoon sugar per cup of flour in yeast breads. I 9 7 Page 60 Changing Your Diet has been a family child care provider for several years. Inaddition to raising 3 children of her own, she has been a second mother tomany of the children inher neighborhood. She has not only earned areputation as an excellent provider but she is also known for her cooking. She.especially enjoys making cakes, cookies, and candy. According to Patricia,the older children in the neighborhood who were in her day care home asyoungsters still stop by to visit, especially if it is around snack time..Patricia learned to cook from her mother who for many years had been .their small towns' only source for birthday and wedding cakes. She tookspecial orders from people in the community and did the baking in her home.. While it wasn't a full timejob she did do a pretty good business and she taughtPatricia a lot about cooking in the process. Pat credits her mother's business,and her experience as her mom's helper, for the sweet tooth she has today..About three years ago T.\" atricia was introduced to the Child and AdultCare Food Program. She thou ght enrolling in the program would be a greatopportunity to increase her income and to meet other providers. In order tobe reimbursed for the snacks and meals she served, Patricia was required toattend 3 nutrition workshops each year. The first workshop she attendedwas entitled \"PreparingNutritious Snacks.\"Three years and many nutrition workshops later, Patricia still points.to the workshop on nutritious snacks as the one which resulted in the biggestchange in the diets of the children she cares for. Before attending theworkshop, Patricia thought of snacks as the special treats you give children. so that they don't get toohungry and cranky between meals. She alwaysmade sure snack time was fun for the children. They loved the sweet, high-fat treats she made for them and it made her feel good to see them enjoy whatshe served. She had never thought much about how nutritious a snack mightbe. At the workshop she learned just how important nutritious snacks werein making sure children got all of the nutrients and calories they needed togrow and develop. It wasdifficult for Patricia to imagine children eatingcarrots with ranch dressing, or apple slices with peanut blItter with the sameenthusiasm they had for chocolate cake and ice cream, or cookies and kool-.aid, or maybe a homemade brownie or pecan praline. That would be a bigchange at her child care home, but she decided to give it a try.. Page 61 Changing Your Diet.Patricia admits that after teaching the children to expect a sugary .snack, it was not a simple thing to switch them to more nutritious snacks. .It took creativity, patience, and persistence, but Patricia did it. She even. described the change as painless. Here are some of the things she did thatmade it easier.1) She began to experiment with some of her recipes. She tried reducing the.. amount of sugar and fat and found that in most cases, sugar and fat couldbe reduced without her or the children even noticing.4, . . .2) She began baking fewer cookies and cakes with icing and more muffins ..and bread-like cakes like zucchini bread and banana bread. She mixed .whole grain flour with white flour, added fruit where she could, and4,skipped the icing. Even though the muffins and breads were less sweet.and more nutritious, the children still loved them. They especially loved .the bite-size muffins Patricia made.. .. . .3) Patricia put aside her ideas about what children would and would not eat,.and began offering them fresh vegetables and dips, fresh fruit, and cheeseand crackers. She was surprised to find that for the most part they notonly ate these foods but they seemed to like them. This was especially true ii ..when she did something different to make eating fun. For example, .. sometimes she would take the children outside and they would have apicnic during snack time. Patricia says there always seems to be one child... 4.who frowns at vegetables, and refuses to eat them, but in time they comearound. ... 4.4) At the workshop, it was suggested to Patricia that she involve the children 45.in preparing the new more nutritious snacks. Helping with preparationmakes children more willing to taste new foods. This seemed to work. In.fact, once they learned that snack time meant they got to help, the . . . children looked forward to snack time even more. Patricia let themparticipate in many ways. They helped wash vegetables and fruits andarranged them on platters. They spread peanut butter on crackers andstuffed celery with pimento cheese. They even helped to make banana 4. bread by stirring the batter and mashing the bananas. Sometimes . Patricia would provide them with slices or chunks of fresh fruit and cheese.and let them arrange it on bread, crackers, or even their plates to make .

It was not time wasted. She used these activities to teach the. .children about counting, colors, shapes and textures.

Page 63,r) 0 Changing Your Diet 5. To decrease your intake of salt and sod um,pick from these suggestons: A. Select low salt or no salt food products.Read the food labels. Any ingredient that includes \"sodium\" as part of its namecontains sodium. Choose the items with the least amount of sodium.Limit the amount of salt you use as seasoning. Try herbs, spices, and lemon juiceinstead.Limit your intake of salty foods such as potato chips, pretzels, salted nuts and popcorn,condiments (soy sauce, steak sauce, garlic salt), pickled foods, sandwich meats andfrankfurters, some cheeses, and some canned vegetables, stews and soups.Try the lower sodium versions of processed foods like soups, salad dressings, andsauces when they are available.Avoid commercially prepared sauces, such as barbecue sauce and ketchup. Theseare often high in sugar, sodium, or both.Use less of high-sodium condiments, such as soy sauce, pickles, and monosodiumglutamate (MSG).B. Cook without salt or add as little as possible.If you typically use lots of salt, try cutting back gradually. You will becomeaccustomed to less salt over time.If you must add salt, it is best to do so after the food is cooked, not during cooking.Food will taste more \"salty\" with salt on it, rather than cooked into it. Try to add as littleas possible. And don't put the shaker on the table.If you must salt uncooked meat, add no more than 1/4 teaspoon per pound.Season meats with herbs and spices or blends of herbs and spices, such as \"ItalianSeasoning.\" Read the label and avoid those with salt as a major ingredient. Salt is not necessary when cooking pasta, rice, and hot cereals. Try cooking pasta orrice in unsalted broth or unsalted tomato juice. Page 659 (1 1 Changing Your Diet C. Modify recipes to reduce the amount of salt or sodium or try new recipes for lowsalt] low sodium substitutes.Make your own lowfat, low-sodium condiments. For example, try maldng your own salsaby mixing diced fresh or \"no-salt-added\" canned tomatoes with diced onions, green peppers,and chilies. Develop a recipe that suits your taste by adding cummin, cilantro, garlic, and/orlime juice.If using ham or other cured meat in a recipe, omit salt and avoid using other ingredientshigh in sodium.Use onion and garlic powder rather than onion salt, garlic salt, and other seasoning salts.Reduce or omit salt when using salted processed foods such as canned vegetables or soupsin recipes. For example, reduce or omit salt from pasta and rice casseroles when using cheese,canned soup, or canned vegetables. Try \"no-salt-added\" canned vegetables.Sodium is a part of salt and most leavening agents like baking powder and baking soda.You can usually reduce the amount of these ingredients and still make a good quality product.Use 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder per cup of flour in biscuits, muffins, or waffles. Use 1teaspoon baking powder per cup of flour in cakes.Use 1/4 teaspoon salt per cup of flour in yeast breads. (In yeast breads, salt helps to controlthe acdon of the yeast.) Use only half the amount of salt called for in baked products other thanyeast breads.Do not reduce the salt in recipes for cured meats or pickled or brined vegetables. In thisinstance salt is acting as a preservative. ( Remember: Home canned or cured foods are notcredible for reimbursement by the Child and Adult Care Food Program.)

Currently Amy caresfor 4 children and is working on filling some . vacancies. .. . . .Amy began limiting salt and sodium for her family long before it. .became a concern to the general public. About 20 years ago her husband was 4. .diagnosed with high blood pressure. The physician recommended a low-. .4,sodium diet as part of the treatment for his condition. For Amy, who did most ... .of the cooking, it was easier to put the entire family on a low-sodium diet than . .to cook two separate meals. In addition, Amy wanted to lower the risk of other . . . .members of the family developing high blood pressure. She changed her. . . .shopping, food preparation, and eating habits. Within a year or two her new. . . healthier habits had become second nature, and her family could hardly. . . .remember when they ate differently. ..4. .According to Amy, the most important thing she learned in terms of.. reducing the sodium in her family's diet was how to read food labels. She. . . .pointed out that unless you really look for sodium in foods, it often goes. . . 4,unnoticed. For example, she was surprised to learn that some cheeses are.high in sodium. If she had relied upon a salty taste to tell her, Amy says she. .. .. .would never have known.. . . ..When I imagined Amy grocery shopping, I pictured her spending hours.. ..going up and down isles reading the label of every food product she selects. ..Amy assured me that that was not an accurate picture. She admitted that for. .. .a while reading labelsdid slow her shopping down some. But now she knows . . .what products to buy without having to read the labels. And it is not as . . complex as it sounds. For example, she never reads food labels for vegetables..4. . She knows that canned vegetables are higher in sodium than frozen, so when.fresh is not available, she automatically buys the frozen. That was a pretty. .. .easy thing for her to remember and it made a big difference in the amount of . .. .. Page 63 Changing Your Diet.sodium her family consumed. Amy knows her grocery store shelves well. She .. . .has learned what products are high in sodium and what products are low in 4. . . .sodium. The only time she needs to read the labels now is when she is . considering purchasing a new food item, or one that she usually does of curiosity, I asked Amy how she seasoned her vegetables. I . . .4,was a little concerned that she be might be substituting more high-fat .. seasonings, like butter, for the salt she was eliminating. She said that. . sometimes she serves vegetables without any seasoning at all. Other times. .y she uses lemon juice and herbs like oregano, dill, basil, and tarragon. Am. . says that she and the children just experiment until they finds a taste thatthey like. In fact, experimenting with herbs has become a favorite activity in ..4.her day care home. . . . . . . . Amy had always wanted a vegetable garden but really did not have the. . time or the space. She decided to plant a few herbs in her flower beds and a.hi.few in pots wch she placed on her patio. If nothing else, she thought the . ... .children might enjoy watching the herbs grow. Now the children have 4, learned to identify most of the herbs she planted. Sometimes Amy pinches off. 4, a leaf, has the children close their eyes and try to identify the herb by its smell.. . Much to her surprise some of the children have gotten pretty good at it..Sometimes Amy allows each child to pick the herb to use in seasoning a .. . . .veg table on their plate. The children not only enjoy this activity, but it seem . that they eat more vegetables as a result. . .. . . 4.4.When Amy reduced the salt and sodium. in the meals she serves she .. . introduced the children to a new world of herbs and spices.

ColoradoState University Cooperative Extension. FortCollins ,Co. PI0 Page 78 Changing Your DietCooking To Conserve NutrientsSupportingFor The Provider WhoThe nutritional value of foods dependsin part on how you cook or prepare them. Thefollowing suggestions will help you to get themost from the foods you serve.Steam vegetables rather then boiling or use aslittle water as possible.Peel vegetables after they are cooked.Do not cut vegetables into small pieces forcooking. Do not cut them at all until you areready to use them. The air destroys vitamin C.Do not overcook vegetables. Vegetables areready when they are tender to the fork and stillsomewhat crisp.Save cooking water from vegetables and meatstocks to use in soups.Serve vegetables and fruits raw when youcan. Keep them chilled until you are ready touse them so that they retain their vitamin C.Try to time meals so that hot foods are notheld for a long time before serving.InformationWants To !Crow MoreWhen possible, cook in a cast iron skillet.Iron skillets release iron which our bodies canuse into the foods that are cooked in them.Don't cook dry beans or dry peas withbaking soda, or use baking soda to improvethe color of vegetables. This creates a condi-tion which destroys B vitamins and adds so-dium.Thaw frozen juices in the refrigerater. Whenjuices are allowed to thaw on the countc.T, theymay get warm. Heat destroys vitamin C.When possible, buy milk in containers thatdon't let in light. In other words, buy milk incartons rather than in clear plastic jugs. Lightcan affect the potency of the B vitamins. Eventhough you are storing your milk in a darkrefrigerator, it was probably exposed to lightwhile being stored in the refrigerated section ofthe grocery store.Store whole grain flours in the refrigerator.Do not wash rice before cooking or rinsecooked pasta. It washes away nutrients. Page1 1 CHAPTER 4 HUNGRY BODIES,HUNGRY MINDS:RECIPESANDLEARNINGACTIVITIESFORCHILDREN Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds In the introduction you will read about:influences on children's eating habits and food preferences page 2and involving children in food preparation page 3 ? 1 '3Page 1This manual was made possible by an educational grant from Nestle USA, Inc. toSave The Children Child Care Support Center. Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds The eating habits and attitudes about food that children developduring their preschool years often last throughout their lives. Researchsuggests that when those eating habits are nutritious and the attitudesare positive, the result maybe healthier adults with a lower incidence ofchronic disease. It is very important for you as a provider to take yourrole in helping children develop healthy eating habits seriously. You maybe the only person in some children's lives who is able to give this aspectof their development special attention. Influences on Children'sEating Habits and Food Preferences AR children have their likes and dis-likes when it comes to food, and there is nodoubt that these food preferences are real. Butthey are also to a large extent learned.Many factors influence children's likesand dislikes. Anyone who has watched even afew minutes of Saturday morning cartoons cantestify to the fact that food manufacturers spendmillions of dollars advertising foods to children.Unfortunately, these foods are often times not thenutritious foods we would like our children to eat.There are also fast food chains which enticechildren by including toys or games with specialchildren's meals.Parents, friends, and olderbrothers and sisters also play a big role in thedevelopment of children's eating preferences.Parents usually show their likes and dislikes bynot offering the foods they don't like. Siblingsand friends can be a little more obvious when itcomes to expressing their likes and dislikes.When an older sibling or an admired friend\"yuk's\" a food, it may be doomed, at least for awhile. On the other hand, if they like the food,their eating it may convince others to try it.There are also a variety of ways thatyou as a child care provider influence the foodpreferences of the children in your care. Oneway is through the message you give when youoffer foods. Unfortunately, many of us are guiltyof making statements like \"I know you probablywon't like this but try one bite.\" or \"Now this issomething new. At least try it.\" Others of us havebeen known to actually try to bribe children bytelling them that if they eat the food they find lessdesirable, often the vegetables, we will I eat themhave the food they find more desirable, often thedessert. This sends the message that one food isbetter than the other and in this case specifically,that we don't really expect them to like veg-etables. Some signals are more subtle than these.For example, we might serve some foods with anexpression of delight, like we know the childrenare going to love it, and other foods with anexpression of dread, like we know it will takesome pleading to get them to even try it. Eventhough these messages are subtle, children learnfrom them.You also influence children's prefer-ences by the example you set when you eat. Inother words, if you don't eat your vegetables, Page 31 4 Hung:y Bodies, Hungry Mindsthey probably won't eat theirs. The old \"Do asI say, not as I do\" just isn't very effective. If thissounds familiar to you, let your role as a familyday care provider be an incentive for your im-proving your own eating habits. Your health alsomatters. Good nutrition is just as important foryou as it is for the children in your care.One of the biggest ways you influencethe food preferences of the children you carefor is by choosing to offer or not to offer certainfoods. How many of you have looked at a recipeand thought \"My children would never eat that,\"or made the statement \"Children just don't likevegetables?\" It is true that children are usuallyreluctant to try foods that are new and different,but that does not mean they won't ever like them.Research shows that many children have to beoffered a food 8 to 10 times before they reallybegin to like it. Many of you would have givenup on the food long before preparing it the 8th or10th time. However, a food has no chance cfbecoming a favorite if you don't give children achance to discover how good it is. Just as anexercise, look at your menus for the past monthand ask yourself what you are not serving. Youhave to suspend your notions of what childrenwill and will not eat and be adventurous inyour food offerings.Remember, when it comes to children andtheir food preferences, if they don't like a foodcooked one way, they may like it cooked anotherway, or, if they don't like it cooked, they may likeit raw; if they did not like it last week, they maylike it this week. It is normal for children to havefood preferences, and you should respect theirpreferences. But you also need to make certainthat you have given them every opportunity todiscover new tastes and develop healthy foodpreferences. There is something you can do thatwill increase their willingness to try new foods.Involving Children in Food Preparation One of the best ways to get children totry new food, is to involve them in the foodpreparation. By increasing their exposure to anew food they are more willing to try it, andtherefore more likely to develop healthy eat-ing habits and positive attitudes toward food.There are a_lso other benefits to involving them inpreparation. One of the most important benefits isthat children enjoy it. It helps to create a relaxedmealtime atmosphere and can be a good way tomove from more active play to quiet dinning.Involving children also gives you good opportu-nities to teach them about nutrition. Even oneyear olds can learn that food gives them energy toplay, helps them to feel good and helps them todevelop healthy bones, teeth, hair, skin andmuscles. Two year olds can begin to identifyfoods by name and explore differences in tasteand smell. Three and 4 year olds can begin tounderstand the concept of food groups, placefoods in their appropriate groups, and construct abalanced meal. Participating in food prepara-tion also teaches children about responsibility,cooperation and sharing. It helps them gain asense of independence and competence.Foods and mealtime activities can alsobe used to help children develop in other ways.If you are like most providers, you spend a largeportion of your day preparing meals or snacks,serving them, or cleaning up afterwards. It takesa big portion of the children's day as well. Makethat time learning time. Consider the followingsuggestions:1. Use mealtime to teach language skills:Increase their vocabulary by teachingthem the names of foods and terms usedin cooking. Page 4 Use foods to teach colors: What foodsare red, green, white, purple, yellow,orange, or brown?Use foods to teach textures: Is this foodcnnichy, smooth, dry, juicy?Use foods to teach flavors: Loes thisfood taste salty, sweet, sour, bit her, spicy,bland?Use foods to teach shapes: Is this foodround, square, oval, rectangular, long,short, flat?Use foods to teach smell: Does the foodhave a strong smeil when it is cooking?Can you identify this food by its odor?2. Use foods and mealtime to teach childrenmath skills:Use foods to help them to understand theconcepts of bigger vs. smaller, more vs.less, same vs. different, heavy vs. light.Use food preparation to help them un-derstand time sequence, before and af-ter, 1st, 2nd, 3rd.Use foods to help them understand sort-ing, matching, measuring and counting.For example, count the number of dif-ferent foods on the table, put all of thefruits on one platter, count the numberof seeds you find in an orange.3. Use food and food preparation to developscience skills:How are foods changed by heat andcold?Where does food comes from? Howdoes it grow? How is it processed andtransported?What are the different parts of plantsthat we eat? What part of the plant is apotato, a bean, a lettuce leaf,broccoli?What are the similarities and differencesbetween foods? How do we dividethem into food groups? Name a foodfrom each group.Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds 4. Use food preparation to help them developsocial skills:Help them learn to share.Teach them about taking turns.Help them to understand the benefits ofteam work and cooperation.5. Use food preparation to help them developtheir motor skills and eye/band coordina-tion.Help them learn to use utensils properly.Provide them with appropriate activi-ties.

Hungry Bodies, Hungry MindsThis chapter is not meant as a completecookbook. However, because the foods youoffer are such a big part of how children learnabout food and develop healthy eating habits,we are providing you with several recipes. Inselecting recipes to include in this chapter we firstlooked at provider menus to get an idea aboutfoods commonly served. Then we looked for themore nutritious versions of those foods. We alsoincluded many recipes aimed at increasing vari-ety and others just because they sounded deli-cious. The Child and Adult Care Food Pro-gram credits are given for each recipe.Activities for teaching children aboutnutrition are also included in this chapter. Wehope that these suggestions will inspire yourcreativity and help you to think of others. Weals\u00b0offer options of ways the children can beinvolved in the preparation of each of therecipes. Refer to the information on \"what canchildren do?\" to help you decide if the activityis right for the children in your home.In order to make involving children infood preparation more fun for you and them,consider the following:1. Make sure the tasks you are giving them areappropriate for their age. Giving childrentasks they are not physically ready for will befrustrating for both of you. If the tasks wesuggest are not right for your children, think ofother ways they can help. (Don't forget settingthe table and cleaning up.)2. Be safe: Establish rules about safety duringchildren's participation in the kitchen. Forexample, you may want to establish a \"nochildren zone\" in the area nearest the stove.Talk about things that could be hot, things thatcould cut, and how to correctly use each utensil.1. Pick an activity appropriate for the numb(' rof children in your care.Some activitiesrequire more supervision than others. Makesure you can supervise all of the children suffi-ciently. Make sure everyone ( al participate inthe activity. Children can get impatient. Planactivities that don't keep them waiting too longfor their chance to help or encourage them topush in order to see what is happening.4. Be prepared. Gather all of the ingredientsand utensils you will need before you gatherthe children. In some cases it will be dangerousfor you to leave children unsupervised. It willbe easier for you to relax and enjoy watching thechildren learn and experience new things if youknow you are prepared.5. Allow extra time. Realize that the children'shelp will not necessarily mean the job will goquicker. It may mean just the opposite. How-ever, this is not just about preparing the snackor meal anymore. It is a learning activity. Thepoint is to learn and enjoy learning whilepreparing the snack or meal.6. Don't demand a perfect product. The ham-burger patties may not be perfectly round, thelettuce torn a little too small, and there may bealmost as much peanut butter on the handle ofthe spoon as there is stuffed in the trough of thecelery. The children will remember the fun theyhad much more than they will remember theappearance of the meal. And the only way theywill get better is through experience.7. Encourage the children to tell their parentsabout what they ate and how they helped toprepare it. This will help the children to de-velop verbal skills and it will help you incommunicating to the parents how well theirchildren are doing .It will also give the parentsan opportunity to praise their child and toreinforce the lessons you teach them. It mayalso encourage the parents to expand their foodofferings at home.8. Begin every activity with hand washing. Page 6217 Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds IMMO/We hope that as a result of this chapter, you will begin to look at the recipesin your recipe file with two questions in mind:1.

When served with french fries, the fat really adds up. Here are some ways to reduce thefat in hamburgers.For a better Basic Burger:1. Select lean ground beef. Generally, the lighter the color, and lower the price, and the morefat has been ground up with the meat. Ground chuck is usually lower in fat than ground beef,and ground round and ground sirloin are even leaner.2. When cooking hamburger patties, place them on a rack sprayed with nonstickvegetable oil spray and broil. (The rack allows the grease to drip away from the patties.) Toremove even more of the grease, allow the cooked patties to drain on paper towels beforeservin g.To make a burger even lower in fat:Use lean ground turkey instead of ground beef'. Not all ground turkeyis lean. Unless the package specifies ground turkey breast, you should assume that theskin and other turkey parts are included. In this case the ground turkey may be leanerthan some gound beef, but not leaner than ground chuck, ground round, ground sirloin,or even ground beef labelled extra lean. If you are buying ground turkey ground freshat your grocery store, ask the butcher what parts of the turkey were used. If you havea food processor, you might want to buy turkey breasts, remove the sldn, and grind ityourself. Turkey can be substituted for ground beef in most recipes .Here are hamburger recipes which use ground turkey. When you make the burger patties,consider doubling the recipe and storing the extra patties in the freezer for next time.TURKEY BURGERS(Makes 4-5 patties.)ground turkey breast 1 poundoat-bran cereal 1/4 cupgarlic clove, minced 1 largeonion, finely chopped 1/4 cupgreen pepper, finely chopped 1/8 cupsalt or sodium-alternative seasoning 1 teaspoonMix all the ingredients together and form into patties.

After thechildren have washed their hands, let them put sandwich bags on theirhands for gloves. Provide them with a clean surface and let them takea bit of the meat or brown rice mixture and make a ball. Then have themflatten the ball into a patty. (Try to remember whose patty is where whenyou cook them. The children will want the patty they made with theirown hands.) Children as young as two should be able to participate inthis activity. This is also a good opportunity to teach children aboutshapes. Let them name other foods that are round and foods that are flat.arranging the garnish tray. Let the children make the garnish tray byarranging the lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pickles and other items.washing and tearing lettuce.

Let the children select their own condimentsand spread them with either a plastic knife or a spoon. What colors arethese condiments? What other foods are these same colors?building their own burger. This activity is a good opportunity to helpchildren understand a variety of concepts. For example, what did younut on top, what did you put on the bottom, what did you put in themiddle. What goes on your burger first, second, third. What food groupsare included in your burger? Name the different vegetables that you usedto make your burger. Identify the different colors of the foods includedin your burger. Let the children decide what ingredients to put on theirburgers. Cut the burgers in half before they garnish them and encouragethem to garnish each side differently and compare the tastes. 907 Page 20 Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds FRENCH FRIESMost providers are familiar with packaged oven fries. Fries prepared in the oven contain lessfat and are casier and less messy to prepare than french fries fried on top of the stove. Oven fries alsoeliminate the danger associated with frying foods while trying to watch and care for children. If youare forced to leave frying foods unattended, even for a minute, to attend to a child, you risk a grease fireor a child somehow being burned by the hot oil. Because of these dangers, we recommend that you notfry foods while you are caring for children. Instead, try these recipes for oven fries and cheesy oven fries. OVEN FRIES(Serves 3-4.)2 large potatoesoil, salt, pepperScrub potato skins well and dry them (do not peel). Cut each potato in halfand then into finger-sized pieces (about 1/2 inch in diameter). Spread ona shallow baking pan and dribble oil over all of the pieces. Turn them sothat all sides are coated, and salt and pepper lightly. Bake in preheated 400oven for 30 to 45 minutes, or until tender. Turn potatoes with a spatulaseveral times during the cooking.(Source: Sharing in the Kitchen, Sharon Cadwallader.)CACFP meal component credit:1 vegetable Children can help by:scrubbing the potato skins.

Show them by sprinkling water on their hands. 9 nif Page 22 Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds More Fun: Food ExperimentsHere are three experiments you can do with items you probablyalready have in your home.Watching Beans SproutSoak a handful of dry beans, at least one bean per child, in waterovernight. The next day let each child pick a bean. Instruct them tofold a wet paper towel, lay the bean on it and then put it in a zip lockbag. Seal the bag and tape it to the window. As long as the paper towelstays moist the beans will sprout and grow. Eventually you will haveto open the bag and give the spi.out more room.Use this experiment to talk with children about the parts of aplant or the way plants grow. Plan a menu that includes both salad anddry beans. Let them put their bean sprouts in their salad. Talk abouthow beans and bean sprouts are different and what they have incommon. Watching Celery Absorb WaterPlants need water just like we do. This experiment showschildren how a plant absorbs water. If the children are old enough tounderstand the parts of a plant, you can use the experiment to showthem how the stem or stalk carries water from the roots of the plant toits leaves.Cut and wash 2 or more celery stalks. For each stalk of celery,partially fill a glass with water. Put about 1 teaspoon of food col, ringin each glass. (For fun, make each glass a different color.) As the celeryabsorbs water, the color will move up the stalk. Pa?eaM Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds Making ButterIn this experiment children use heavy cream to make butter.What animal gives us milk? What other food products do we makefrom milk? To make butter we shake or churn milk. What do we do tomake ice cream?For this experiment you need 1/2 pint of heavy cream, a marblewhich you have sanitized, and a clear pint size plastic container witha tight fitting lid. Put the cream in the jar with the marble and put thelid on tightly and securely. Make sure no leaking can occur. Let thechildren take turns shaking the container. (This is also a goodopportunity to discuss the concepts of teamwork and taking turns.) Atfirst you will hear the marble moving. Then the cream will become sothick that you won't be able to hea the marble moving. Then the butterwill form. Drain the butter from the buttermilk. (Offer the children ataste of the buttermilk.) Wash the butter with cold water to remove anytrapped buttermilk and pack it down. Store the butter in the refrig-erator and serve it later on a cracker. Better yet, spread butter on apiece of toast. What happens when the butter gets hot? Source: Some of these ideas were ,taken from science ExperimentsYou Can Eat by Vicki Cobb, 1972, Scholastic, Inc.; New York. Manyof the experiments in this book are more appropriate for youngerschool age children. However, some of them can easily be adapted forpreschoolers. In addition, the book will probably inspire you to createyour own food experiments.

Letting the children measure ingredientshelps to develop their math skills and their hand-eye coordination. Theyounger children will have an easier time measuring cups than tea-spoons or tablespoons. The smaller utensil is more difficult for them tohandle. You may want to let them measure and pour into a container thatdoes not contain the recipe. Then you can pour the measured ingredientsinto the cooking food. This will safeguard against their adding thewrong amount of something to your recipe and keeps them safely awayfrom the heat source.setting the table.

And once thegrocery stores are created,children can use them in playing manydifferent games. Choose a part of the play area where they can set upthe grocery store and leave it for a few weeks or until they tire of it. Ifyou have bookshelves inthe play area, turn them into grocery storeshelves for a few weeks. Try using shoe boxes or other small boxes,baskets, or even grocery store bags for fruit and vegetable bins.Several items can be used to stock your grocery store.Save food containers like unbreakable jars, boxes, and cartons.Use them to represent the foods they originally contained or gluepictures of a different food on the boxes. Ask parents to contributeby saving their clean food boxes and unbreakable containers.Toy stores carry a variety of plastic fruits and vegetables.Consider purchasing some of these to add to your toy collection.Save bags from frozen vegetables. Wash them out well, let thechildren stuff them with crumpled newspaper, and tape or staplethem shut.Fold cardboard so that it stands up like a tent. Cut pictures offoodout of magazines or seed ca;alogs. Glue a picture of the food thatthe tent will represent to the front of tent.ShelveS can be organized in several different ways. In fact,stocking the shelves is one of the games children will enjoy playingwith their grocery store. Try some of the ideas below and add some ofyour own.Shelves can be organized by food group, with each food groupgetting its own shelf. For example, foods from the bread, cereal,rice and pasta group would be placed on one shelf, foods from themilk, yogurt and cheese group on another, etc.Foods can be grouped by color, using either the color of thepackage or the color of the food it contains.Foods can be grouped by the type or size of the package. Forexample, children can put boxes on one shelf, plastic bags onanother, and plastic jars and bottles on another. They canarrange the items on ashelf from the smallest to the largest. Page 35P41 Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds You might also ask children to put foods they have tried before onone shelf, and foods they have never tried on another. You mightthen decide to try one food from the \"new foods\" shelf each week.There are many different ways that you can use thechildren's grocery store to teach the children about foods and nutri-tion. Here are some suggestions.After a meal, ask the children to pick from the store those foodsyou served.Select all but one item for a meal and let the children select a fooditem to complete the meal. Help them to make a good choice.Have the children take turns selecting foods for lunch one day aweek, or let a birthday child pick his/her birthday meal. You canhelp children choose foods that make a complete meal by firstputting the foods in groups, and then telling the children howmany foods to pick from each group. You may want to let thisbecome a tradition in your family child care home.Ask the children to go to the store and purchase all of the fooditems you would need to make a favorite dish. For example, askthem to purchase the food items needed to make spaghetti andmeatballs or fruit salad or bean burritos.Let one or more children pick foods from the grocery store toprepare a pretend dinner that they will serve to the otherchildren.You can also use the foods in the grocery store to help childrenlearn lessons about things other than foods and nutrition. Use thefoods in the grocery store to teach colors and shapes. Ask children topick out some food items that are green, a food that is round. Use fooditems to teach children how to count. Use grocery games and playmoney or real money to teach older children how to make change.You will probably create many fun ways the children can usethe grocery store and the food items to have fim while learning. Butremember, it is also important to give children plenty of opportunitiesfor free play. Let them arrange the shelves their way and develop somegames of their own. They will spend hours being creative and learningwithout even realizing it. Page 36p 4 p Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds Fried Chicken:Frying chicken in the oven, rather than on top of the stove, is better for a few different reasons.First, the chicken will be lower in fat if fried in the oven rather than in extra oil on top of the stove. Second,oven frying is a safer way to cook, especially with children in the home. Finally, frying on top of the stovecan create quite a mess. Oven frying means easier clean up for you.Here are two recipes for oven fried chicken. You can choose to leave the skin on the chicken ortake the skin off before cooking. We recommend removing the skin before cooking. The skin is thefattiest part of the chicken. Removing the skin allows children to eat the crunchy coating without gettingso much fat. However, even if you choose to leave the skin on your oven fried chicken, it will still belower in fat than chicken fried on top of the stove.

They may notbe able to go and purchase a product for themselves, but they can oftentimes talk an adult into doing it for them. As a result, many companiestarget their commercials to children, especially during those timeswhen they know many children are watching.This activity is a good first step at helping children understandwhat they see on T.V. and become wise consumers. Making commer-cials is also a fun way for children to learn about food and nutrition.Children enjoy dramatic play. It allows them to use their imaginationsand to learn in an active way, the way most children naturally learn.Making commercials helps children develop social skills and languageskills and allows them to burn up some energy. This activity is best forchildren 4 years old and up. However, there are usually ways youngerchildren can participate. Use these suggestions as a starting point andlet the game change to suit your children.There are many different ways children can play at makingcommercials. They can make commercials as a team, a couple, orindividually. They can advertise a favorite food or a new food they havejust learned about or eaten. They might want to advertise a specialmeal, perhaps what they want as their birthday meal, or what theirfamily has on holidays. They may want to make a commercial for afavorite way of preparing a food. For example, one child might talkabout why mashed potatoes are best, another why she prefers bakedpotatoes, and still another child might make a commercial for Frenchfried potatoes.Materials:old clothes for dress-up.Children love to play dress-up, and discarded clothes are usuallypretty easy to get. You may have some old clothes around that thechildren can use. If not, you can usually pick up these items atgarage sales. You might also consider asking parents to donateclothing items the children can use for dress-up. (Old Halloweencostumes are especially prized.) Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds props:It is impossible to say what props children might want to use fortheir commercials. The best idea may be to provide them with avariety of toys and other objects and let their imaginations go towork. If you do not have any food related toys and cooking utensilsin your toy collection, you might want to add a few.Making the commercial.The way you proceed with this activity will depend in part on the agesof your children and how well they understand what you mean by\"making a commercial.\" You may want to start by talking aboutcommercials and helping them to recall commercials they have seen onT.V. You might also demonstrate the activity by acting out a commer-cial yourself or by helping them make the first one. One way to startthe game is to choose a food that everyone seems to like and leteveryone take a turn at making a commercial for it. Another way tostart is by asking everyone to pick their favorite fruit or vegetable andmake a commercial explaining why they like it and why others mightalso like it. Encourage them to \"set the stage\" and \"dress the part.\"Once they catch on to the game it can keep them happy and busy forquite a while. Page 54 Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds Sandwiches:Sandwiches are popular items on provider menus. They are easy to prepare and are especiallygood to serve on busy days when there is little time to cook. Most of us automatically think about somekind of luncheon meat when we think of sandwiches. For some of us it's bologna, for others of us it'scorned beef. Unfortunately, most luncheon meats are high in fat and sodium. More and more we areseeing low-fat, low-sodium luncheon meats in grocery stores, lilce some brands of turkey ham and turkeybologna. Still you have to be cautious and read the labels carefully. Not all of the luncheon meats thatclaim to be \"Low Fat, Low Sodium\" are as low as they would have you believe.You can also make sandwiches without using luncheon meats at all.

PASTAPasta is a good source of complex carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates give children ene-gy.In reviewing provider menus we noticed that there are two very popular pasta dishes. These aremacaroni and cheese and spaghetti with meat sauce. Yet there are a variety of different pastas and avariety of ways to serve them. This section gives recipes for those 2 popular pasta dishes, plus recipesfor other pasta dishes that we encourage you to try. There is also a recipe for spaghetti squash. Try usingspaghetti squash instead of spaghetti noodles with your favorite spaghetti sauce.We also encourage you to be creative with your own pasta or pasta sauce recipes. For example,try experimenting with your spaghetti sauce by adding vegetables like zucchini. Try using a favoritepasta dish as a way to introduce children to vegetables that are new to them. Sometimes children are morewilling to uy a new food when it is served as a part of a favorite or familiar dish. BAKED SPAGHETTI SQUASHTake an average-sized spaghetti squash (3 to 4 pounds), pierce the skin in3 or 4 spots and place in preheated 350 degrees oven. It's best to leaveit in for about 1-1/2 hours.

For those who care forchildren, March, 1991. Englewood, CO.)Make a deck of food picture cards to use in the game of Go Shop.What you and the children do:1. You will need 65 cards for this game This is 13 more than thenumber that comes in a full deck. Perhaps you have someold, incomplete decks around the house that you can com-bine so that you have enough cards. If not, you will need topurchase two decks.2. Cut pictures of food from magazines and seed catalogs. Cutpictures so that only one food group is shown. For example,find a picture of corn all by itself rather than in a combina-tion dish. If the picture does not cover the card completelycut a plain piece of white paper to cover the entire card andthen paste or use double sided tape to attach the food pictureto the card.3. To complete the set of cards you'll need 13 pictures each offoods to represent the 5 food groups. Those food groups are:bread, cereal, rice and pasta groupvegetable groupfruit groupmilk, yogurt and cheese groupdry beans, eggs, nuts, fish, poultry, and meat groupIt may take some time before you and the children have find allof the right pictures to complete your deck.

Put theremaining cards in a stack face down between the players.The players arrange their cards and try to make a set with onecard of each of the 5 food groups.Ha player has a set she can put it down. If she does not havea complete set she asks one of the other players if she has afood group card she needs. For example, a player might askanother \" Do you have a dairy group?\" If that player has thiscard, she must give it to the person requesting it. if thatperson does not have a card in that group, she tells the personrequesting it to \"Go Shop.\" Then the player who had requestedthe card must draw a card from the deck in the center. If thecard from the deck is a card that completes a set for thatplayer, the player places the set down and takes another turn.If the card does not complete a set, her turn is over. It is theother player's turn.Continue playing in this manner until one player has laiddown all of the cards in her hand.

Page 789 Ci toHungry Bodies, Hungry MindsVEGETABLES: Justified or not, children have a reputation for disliking vegetables. Some of us consider ourselveslucky if we can find a few vegetables our children will eat. We stick with those vegetables, serving themover and over and over. Yet of all of the food groups, vegetables may be the food group that gives usthe most choices. There are a wide variety of vegetables to choose from and countless ways to preparethem.Don't give up on your children being vegetable lovers. Keep trying. Offer a variety of vegetablesand try preparing them a variety of different ways. Some of the tastiest ways to prepare vegetables arealso the simplest and most nutritious ways to prepare them. Consider steaming, stir-frying and baking.These cooking methods are explained below.POPULAR COOKING METHODS THAT CONSERVE NUTRIENTSSTEAMINGSteaming is an excellent way to cook vegetables, especially green leafy veg-etables, asparagus, artichokes, broccoli, cauliflower, corn, peas, root vegetables, stringbeans and any of the summer squashes. Some people purchase a vegetable steamer likethe collapsible stainless steel basket that fits in any size pan. In using the basket steamera small amount of water is placed in a pot. The vegetables are placed in the steamer basketwhich sits in the pot above the water. The water never touches the vegetables. They arecooked by the steam. You can also steam vegetables without purchasing a commercial steamer. Simplyput small amount of water in a pan and add the vegetables. Cover the pan with a tight fittinglid and keep on low-medium heat until the vegetables have cooked. (Don't let all of thewater cook away.) Vegetables should be a little crisp and still brightly colored when theyare done. Be careful not to overcook them.On the following pages there are several recipes for preparing vegetables.However, steaming is one of the tastiest, easiest and quickest ways to prepare them. Letyour children try some of the vegetables mentioned above seasoned with a littlemargarine, lemon juice, and/or herbs.STIR-FRYINGStir-frying is another popular cooking method for vegetables. Like steaming, stir-fryingleaves vegetables somewhat crisp and still brightly colored. Stir-frying requires a littleoil, and therefore adds fat while steaming does not. However, both methods are goodways to cook vegetables while conserving nutrients.To stir-fry you first ackismall amount of oil to the pan. When the oil is hot (theflame on your stove should be quite high) you add the vegetables. To prevent thevegetables from burning, stir them continuously until they are done. If you are cookingPage 79 Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds several vegetables in one dish, those that take the longest to cook should be added first.Season with garlic, ginger, or other spices. See the recipe for vegetable stir-fry in thissection of the recipes.BAKINGBaking also conserves the nutrients in vegetables. Baking is a good cookingmethod for winter squashes, onions, tomatoes, leeks, cauliflower, broccoli, eggplants,parsnips, potatoes, and rutabaga. See the recipe for baked cauliflower in this section ofrecipes. 904 Page 80 Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds MASHED POTATO AND CAULIFLOWER(Serves 3 or 4.)potato, peeled and chopped 1 largecauliflower, chopped 1 small headonion, chopped 1/2 smallmilk, warm 1/3 cupmargarine 2 tablespoonssalt and nutmeg to tasteSteam potatoes above water or in very little water for 5 minutes.

Page 909 q Hungry Bodies, Hungry MindsMore Fun: A Food.CollageA collage is more or less a picture made by gluing things to a surface. In thiscase, the children will be gluing various pictures cut out of a magazines and perhapseven dried beans and other dried food items to a piece of cardboard or thick paper.This activity gives children a hands-on chance to use their imagination. It is anactivity that children of all ages can enjoy.Making the food collage is only part of the fun. The collage can be used formany different games and activities that are fun for children and teach them aboutfoods and nutrition. A few ideas for using the collage are provided here. You willno doubt come up with many more games and activities of your own.Materials needed:Old magazines, grocery store advertisements, seed catalogs, any printedmaterials with pictures of foods that the children can cut out or tear out.a piece of cardboard or thick paperscissors with round endsglue or modge-podge (Modge-podge is a non-toxic glue that can also be used as acoating. You brush it over the collage and it dries clear giving the collage a glazed look.You can also use clear contact paper or co-laminating paper to coat the collage.)dried foods like dry beans and dry peas, pastas, oatmeal, rice (optional).(Watch the younger children around these foods. They can easily choke on dry beans ifthey put them in their mouths.)Making the Collage:Most children 3 years old and older can use scissors with round ends to cutout pictures. Younger children can tear out pictures. Let the children glue thepictures to the cardboard or thick paper arranging them in any order. The kinds ofpictures children use will depend on how you plan to use the collage once it is made.You can also use dried foods like dry beans and dry peas, pasta, oatmeal, corn husksand rice in the collage. This makes it 3 dimensional and provides you with goodmaterials for discussing textures and shapes. After the children have completed thecollage, you may want to let them brush over it with modge-podge or a similarproduct. This puts a protective coating on the collage and makes it hold up betterwith frequent use. It can be purchased at most art and crafts stores.Regardless of the way you plan to use the collage, you will probably want itto have a theme. For example, you might want only pictures of vegetables in thecollage, or only foods. You may want to use a color theme, for example pictures thatare primarily red. You may decide to let the children use any pictures they select,as long as there are pictures of foods from each of the food groups. Your theme willdepend on how you plan to use the collage once it is made. You should have a prettygood idea about how you will use it before you get the children started. Here are somesuggestions to consider.Page 91995 Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds Activities Using the Food Collage:There are many fun activities for children using the food collage. Theactivities you choose will depend in part upon the age of the children in your care.For 2 and 3 year olds:If you have both food and non-food pictures in the collage, ask the childrento point to pictures of things that we eat and things that we do not eat.Ask them to point to something they like to eat, or perhaps to a favorite food.You can also use the collage to help children learn colors and shapes. Askthem to point to a red food. How, many pictures of green foods can they find?Can they find a round food?Children this age are also learning the names of foods. Show them twodifferent foods and ask them to name them. Then ask them which food isbigger and which food is smaller. Ask them to find a cherry in the foodcollage, a squash, a slice of bread, or some other food item.If you used dried foods in your food collage, ask them to find a piece of pastaand a picture of a plate of cooked pasta. Did they know how pasta lookedbefore it was cooked? Which one is hard and which one is soft?For 4 and 5 year olds:Four and five year olds may still enjoy the activities above. In addition, you mighttry these suggestions.Four and five year olds are beginning to understand that food can be placedin different categories or groups, like vegetables, fruits, and grains. Askthem to see how many pictures of vegetables they can qnd in the foodcollage. How many pictures of fruits?They should also know many foods by their names. Ask them to see howmany pictures of carrots they can find. How many pictures of apples?Let them use the collage to show you what they had for breakfast, or whatthey had for dinner last night. Let them help you plan tomorrow's lunchmenu by pointing to the foods they would like to have. Did they includefoods from each of the food groups? Is it a well balanced .neal?Try showing them what you have planned for lunch and ask them to pointto a food that would make the meal complete.Four and five year olds are also beginning to understand that some foodsare used to make other foods. Can they point to pictures of the foods usedto make macaroni and cheese? Can the identify the vegetables that youregularly put in your green salads? Can they find pictures of some differentfood products made from tomatoes, for example tomato juice and ketchup.There are many fun variations of the food collage idea. For example, you couldmake a different collage for each food group. In addition, the food collage could bea group project or an individual project with each child making his or her own. Bothare good for children for different reasons. You decide what will be the mostenjoyable for the children in your care.Page 92 Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds BEAN STUFFED TOMATO SALAD(Makes 8 servings of 1/2 stuffed tomato each.)Dry beans, cooked 2 cupsham, diced 1/2 cupgreen pepper, finely chopped 1 cuptart salad dressing 1/3 cupSalad greens 3/4 cuptomatoes 4 wholeonion, cut into thin rings 1/4 cupCombine beans, meat, green pepper and dressing; mix well.

Forexample, one provider reported that she regularly took her children tothe farmer's market during times of the day when the market was nottoo busy. She found that the farmers seemed to enjoy talldng to thechildren and were actually great teachers when it came to teachingchildren about foods. In addition, they frequently gave the childrensamples of the fruits and vegetables they were selling. This providerfound that a trip to the farmer's market was an excellent way tointroduce children to new fruits and vegetables and to get them to tasteones they had been reluctant to try. The children were much morewilling to try new fruits and vegetables when they were offered at thefarmer's market, than when she offered a taste at home.Here are some things to consider when you are planning a fieldtrip for the children in your care.Be sure parents know where you will be going and when you plan tobe there. You need to make sure that parents can locate their child incase of an emergency. In some states you are required to have theparents sign a field trip permission slip. Make sure you know therequirements in your state.Make sure the children travel safely. Follow your state's require-ments regarding seat belts and car seats.Be sure you can properly supervise the children. Children usuallybecome excited on field trips and may be more difficult to keep trackof in a new environment. Depending on the children you care for andwhere you are taking them, you may want some assistance. You maybe able to get a parent or neighbor to volunteer for occasional fieldtrips. If not, perhaps there is an older teen in your neighborhood whocan help during field trips after school hours.When possible, visit field trip sites when they are the least busy. Insome cases you may need to get permission from the person in charge.With enough notice, some field trip sites will arrange special tours andtastings for the children. Page 1052 0 7 Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds Consider meeting another provider with her children at a field tripsite.

You will need to have a redapple and a knife handy to make the story work. (You'll understandwhy after you read the story.)To make the story more fun, involve the children in the telling.Encourage them to recite with you the phrase \"little red house with nowindows and no doors and a chimney on top and the star in themiddle.\" Tell the story rather than reading it. Use lots of movementand vary the tone of your voice.Visuals also make a story more interesting for children. Whenyou are finished telling the story, ask them to guess what the little redhouse is. Show them the red apple. It has no windows and no doors, anda stem for the chimney, but where is the star in the middle? Cut theapple in half so that the top of the apple with the stem is one half, andthe bottom part of the apple without the stem is the other half. Do yousee the star? Use half of the apple to make apple prints. Let thechildren dip the apple half in red food coloring and then stamp a pieceof white paper. It will make a red circle with a star in the middle. Usethe other half of the apple, the half not dipped in the food coloring, fortasting. 7 1 8Page 117 Hungry Bodies, Hungry Minds The Little Red HouseWith No Windows and NoDoors and aChimney on Top and a Star in the MiddleOne day baby bear was bored and tired.

Many parents insistthat it must somehow be the provider's fault. If aprovider does not follow proper sanitation proce-dures, there is room for criticism. However, get-ting sick is, to some extent, just a natural part ofchildhood. But by working together, providersand parents can minimize the risk of disease.Through good sanitation practices a pro-vider can reduce the spread of infectious diseasein her family child care home. There may be timeswhen parents need reassurance that as a profes-sional, caring provider you follow these sanita-tion procedures closely.In addition, you maywant to share theseprocedures with the parents.Parents also play a role in preventing the spread ofdisease in the child care home. Remind them thatthey can do their part by following good sanitationprocedures at home and by not bringing sickchildren to child care.No matter how careful you and the child'sparents are in preventingthe spread of disease,children will get sick and will spread the diseaseto others in the home.Children are easy targets forthe germs that cause infectious diseases. Theiryoung immune systemsjust do not provide themwith much protection. In addition, there are sev-eral characteristics of the child care environmentthat make it easy for infectious diseases to spread.First, child care brings together childrenfrom different families, all with different assort-ments of germs. As aresult, children becomeexposed to some germs for the first timehenthey are in child care. They may get sick moreoften until they have built up an immunity to thesegerms.Secondly, diapers and the process ofchanging diapers provides many opportunitiesfor diseases to spread. If you are caring for severalchildren in diapers, keeping children, their toysand play area, and your diaper changing areasanitary is a big challenge.Thirdly, one of the ways children exploretheir world is by placing things in their mouths.Young children frequently place toys in theirmouths and then share them with other childrenwho also place the toys in their mouths. They arenot only sharing the toy, butthey are also sharinggerms and spreadingdisease.No provider can completely rid her childcare home of germs or prevent the spread ofinfectious disease. However, with good personalhygiene, a clean and sanitary family child carehome, and a sound health policy, she can reducethe spread of infectious diseases.About This ChapterThe first part of this chapter gives addi-tional information about infectious diseases andwhat you can do to prevent their spread in yourchild care home. The second part of this chapterfocuses on foodborne illnesses and how they canbe prevented.If you do not understand something you readin this chapter, or would like more informa-tion, call your county or state health depart-ment.If you find any differences between the recom-mendations we make and those made by yourstate licensing agency, follow the recommen-dations that are the most strict, as long as theydo not violate your state'srequirement. Inmost cases it is better to be too cautious thantoo lax.

Others are moredifficult to spread. In order to understand therecommendations for preventing the spread ofinfectious disease, it is important to first under-stand the different ways diseases spread.How Infectious Diseases SpreadInfectious diseases spread in one of three ways.I. Through the air.Some viruses and bacteria float in the air.In some cases they are spread through cough-ing or sneezing. In other cases, they are spreadsimply by being in the same room with aninfected person and sharing breathing space.Examples of diseases spread through the airinclude the flu, colds, chicken pox, meningi-tis, and tuberculosis. (For more informationon tuberculosis see page 19.)2. From stool to hand to mouth.Many disease, including infectious diar-rhea and hepatitis A, are spread when childrenor adults touch feces from an infected person.For example, a toddler may put her hands inher diaper, and then put her fingers in anotherchild's mouth. These germs can also spreadby touching a contaminated object. For ex-aMple, that same toddler may touch a toy ordoorknob after touching her feces and con-taminate it with the virus. Another toddlermay then place the contaminated toy in hermouth or touch the contaminated doorknoband then place her hand in her mouth. Simi-larly, a provider might touch a changing tablethat was not sanitized properly, and then fixherself a sandwich without first washing herhands.Infants and toddlers under three years ofage are especially likely to spread infectiousdiarrhea and hepatitis B. They are at an agewhen everything seems to go in their mouths.In addition, children this age are in diapers.Diapering and cleaning up afterwards pro-vides plenty of opportunities for spreadingthese diseases. This is why following thehandwashing and diapering procedures out-lined in this chapter are especially important.3. Through direct contact.Some diseases are spread when a persondirectly touches infected skin or secretions, orwhen a person touches an object that has beenhandled by an infected person and then toucheshis or her own eyes, mouth, or nose. Objectsthat are likely to become contaminated in-clude combs, brushes, toys, clothing, towels,and furniture. Young children often becomeinfected this way because they explore theworld by touching and placing their mouthson things.Illnesses spread through direct contactinclude colds, skin diseases like impetigo,conjunctivitis, and ringworm, infestations suchas scabies and lice, and whole body illnessessuch as cytomegalovirus, which is caused bycontact with infected saliva or urine. (There isadditional information on cytomegalovirus inthe Special Issue block on page 17.) Page 54 Protecting Children's Health Stopping the Spread of InfectiousDiseaseNow that you understand the way infec-tious diseases spread, you can see the importanceof good personal hygiene and keeping a sanitarychild care home. Following therecommendationsbelow will help you control the spread of infec-tious disease in your child care home.1. Wash your hands and thechildren's handswith warm soapy water, thoroughly andoften.Proper handwashing is thesinglemost effective way to preventthe spread ofdisease in the family child care home. You should wash your hands:before children arrive for the day andafter you clean.The children should wash their hands :when they arrive.You should all wash your hands:before preparing or eating foodafter diapering/toiletingafter contact with body fluids(blood, mucous, vomit, feces, in from outside playafter touching animals ortheir leashes, toys, or dishes.2. Clean and sanitize toysand surfaces andother areas children touchdaily. (More infor-mation on sanitizing and making your ownsanitizing solution is provided on pages 9 and10.)3. Follow correct procedure when changing achild's diaper. (Detailed instructions forchang-ing diapers are provided on page 11. )4. Keep diaper-changing tables and potty-training and toilet areas clean and sanitaryand located away from foodpreparation andeating areas. Always store soiled diapers,wipes, and other contaminated trash in acovered, lined trash container. Empty trashdaily or if needed, more often. (A foot-pedaloperated container lined with a plastic trash bagis recommended for soiled diapers.)S. Use your space wisely. Open space and goodventilation decrease the opportunity forgerms to spread amongchildren. Considerthese suggestions:Do not concentrate toys and equipment insmall areas.Place cots/cribs at least 3 feet from each otherand alternate foot to head so that the aircirculates freely and the children do not breathedirectly on each other.Unless your family day care home is cooledand heated by central air, air out rooms everyday to circulate fresh air, even in winter.

Page 6 Protecting Children's Health PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Day Care Provider Should Know Our hands may look clean, but chances arethey are covered with germs. They become con-taminated by almost everything we touch. It isvery important that we wash our hands often andin the proper manner. In fact, studies show thatproper handwashing could decrease the rate ofdiarrhea among children in child care by 112.Use the following handwashing procedure.1. Wet hands with warm water.2. Cover hands with liquid soap. (Germs canactually live in bar soap.)3. Rub hands together, using a circular motion andsome friction for 20 to 25 seconds. Be sure torub the backs of your hands, your wrists, be-tween your fingers and around your finger-nails. A hand brush would be helpful for wash-ing under nails.4. Rinse hands well under running water, holdingthem so that water flows from the wrists downthe fingers.5. Dry your hands with a paper towel. (Germs canactually live on cloth towels.)6. Turn the faucet off with the paper towel andthrow the towel away into a lined, covered stepcan.(Taken from Family Child Care Health and SafetyChecklist: A packet for family child care provid-as, Abby Shapiro Kendrick and Joanne Gravell,Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Toys'n Things Press, St. Paul, MN.

Page 8 Protecting Children's HealthMaking Your Own Bleach SolutionsSupporting InformationFor the Provider Who Wants To Know More Sanitizing toys, equipment, and sur-faces children touch is necessary to control thespread of infectious disease. If you use a com-mercial product designed for sanitizing, such aslysol, this can get expensive. As an alternative,consider making your own sanitizing solutionusing household bleach. A properly preparedspray bleach solution will kill germs within 5-10seconds of contact.To make sure your bleach solutions stayeffective:1. Prepare a fresh chlorine bleach spraysolution every day.2. Label your spray bottles containing thebleach solution so that you know thestrength of the solution. (As you will soonread, different strength solutions are requiredfor sanitizing different items in your day carehome.)3. Always clean the surface or item, remov-ing dirt, soil, food messes etc., before usingthe sanitizing solution.4. Store the chlorine bleach in original con-tainers away from heat or direct sunlight(heat, light and \"old\" bleach will effect itsstrength.) Store both bleach and bleachsolutions out of children's reach.Here are formulas for 3 differentstrengths of bleach solution.

Page 10 Protecting Children's Health Special Issue: How to Change a Diaper Changing a child's diapers offers many opportunities for spreading infectiousdiseases. To control the spread of infectious diseases, follow these procedures when youchange a child's diapers.Step 1: Check to be sure the supplies you need are ready. Place a disposable paper on thediaper table. (Inexpensive materials such as wax paper, computer paper, grocerybags, or shelf paper can be used.)Step 2: Lay the child on the diapering table. Never leave the child unattended. eventhough you think they are too young to roll over.Step 3: Remove soiled diaper and any soiled clothing. Soiled diaper goes into a covered,plastic lined diaper pail or trash can. Soiled clothing and cloth diapers go into alabeled, plastic bag to be taken home.Step 4: Clean child's bottom with a moist disposable wipe. Wipe from front to back usingeach wipe only once. Repeat with fresh wipes if necessary. Throw awaydisposable wipe and table paper into plastic lined diaper pail or trash can.Step 5: Clean your hands with a disposable wipe. Throw away into plastic lined diaperpail.Step 6: Diaper or dress the child. Now you can hold him or her close to you.Step 7: Wash the child's hands with soap and water. Return the child to the group.Step 8: Clean and disinfect the diaper area and all contaminated surfaces. Replacesupplies. Wash your hands with soap and water.(Adapted from: Preschool Enrichment Team, Inc., Holyoke, MA. Taken from FamilyChild Care Health and Safety Checklist: A packet for family child care providers.

Page 12 Protecting Children's Health a Ai PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat E4ery Family Child Care Provider Should Know Every family child care home shouldhave a written health policy. This policy shouldbe specific about when or under what circum-stances an ill child should be removed from thechild care home, and when or under whatcircumstances the child can safely return with-out the risk of infecting others. In developingyour health policy, ask yourself the followingquestions:1. What are the needs of the sick child? Can Isatisfy those needs while still fulfilling myusual duties with the other children in thehome?2. Can the other children catch the disease?How do I best protect the other children inmy home from becoming ill?3. Does my health policy satisfy state and localhealth regulations?A written health policy not only givesyou a set of guidelines to follow, but it also helpsyou to communicate with parents about ac-tions you may take to protect the children inyour care from the spread of infectious disease.There may be times when you have to ask a parentto keep a child at home or to temporarily makeother care arrangements. A written policy canserve to caution parents of this possibility andencourage them to be prepared with an alternativeplan.A written health policy also lets parentsknow that you are doing your part to preventthe spread of disease in your home and protectihe health of their child. It also educates parentsabout health issues and helps them to understandthe seriousness of some illnesses and the measuresthey need to take to protect themselves and theirfamilies.Use the guidelines on the following pagein developing a health policy for your childcare home. These health policy guidelines weredeveloped by the American Red Cross, AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics and the National Academyof Sciences. The information was taken from thehealth and safety units of the American Red CrossChild Care training manual.Each state issues its own guidelines forwhen a child should be taken out ofchild care and when that child canreturn.In all cases, make sure youcomply with your state guidelines andthat your health policy meets your state'srequirements, Page 139 A Protecting Children's Health Health Policy GuidelinesFrom the American Red Cross, American Academy of Pediatricsand the National Academy of Sciences.Very few illnesses make it necessary to keep a child at home. If the child hasalready exposed others to the infection and is being treated, the disease usuallycannot be passed. However, children with certain diseases should stay home. Theseinclude:Chicken pox (varicella): The child should stay home for 6 days if the child has not beenin contact with the other children in the group in the day or 2 before the rashappeared; if the child is too ill to participate; or if the child needs more care thanthe caregiver can provide. In general, keeping the child with chicken pox at homewill not stop its spread if the other children already were exposed to the child oneday before the rash developed.Hepatitis A: The child should stay home until all those who should be protected havereceived gamma globulin shots.Impetigo: The child should stay home until treatment starts.Infectious conjunctivitis (pink eye): The child should stay home until the day aftertreatment begins.Infectious diarrhea: The child should stay home until the diarrhea stays in the diapersor the child can get to thetoilet; or until a health provider says the child can return.Lice: The child should stay home until the day after treatment starts. Ringworm: The child should stay home treated for 24 hours, but need not be senthome if the sore can be covered.Scabies: The child should stay home until treatment starts.Strep throat, scarlet fever: The child should stay home until the day after treatmentwith antibiotics.Vaccine-preventable diseases (Diseases prevented by immunizations): The childshould stay home until a health provider says the child may return to the child caresetting. Page 149 43 Protecting Children's Health Symptoms That Indicate A Child Should Stay HomeWhen a child has certain symptoms, he or she should stay home or be caredfor in a special care setting. The child may return when a physician has said that the childdoes not put the other children at risk of getting ill and the child is well enough toparticipate in activities. These symptoms include the following:A fever and the child is feeling or acting ill.Fever is a sign that the body is fighting some problem. Fever is not a disease. Theimportance of a child having a fever depends on what is causing the fever and howthe child is behaving. For example, if nothing else is wrong and the child had adiphtheria-tetanus-pertus (DPT) shot the day before, or had a measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot 7 to 10 days before, fever alone does not mean that the childshould stay home.There are certain times when a fever means a child should stay home. Theseinclude those times when:An infant under 4 months of age has an underarm temperature of 100 degxeesFahrenheit or higher or a rectal temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.Get medical help immediately.A child between the ages of 4 months and 24 months has a rectal temperature of102 degrees Fahrenheit or higher or an underarm temperature of 101 degreesFahrenheit or higher.A child over 24 months has an oral temperature or underarm temperature of 102degrees or higher.Vomiting or upset stomach.A child with repeated vomiting can easily spread germs through the vomit. Thechild will also need a caregiver's attention. Unless you can provide the child withone-to-one attention, a child who vomits repeatedly should be sent home.If the child vomits only once and has no other symptoms, the child probably doesnot have to go home immediately. Some children vomit in the morning when theyhave swallowed mucous the night before.If the child is vomiting and also has other symptoms such as abdominal pain,diarrhea, and significant behavior changes, the child should stay home.Looser and more frequent stools than usual (diarrhea):When a child has a single loose stool, he or she does not need to be at home.However, if the child has very runny stools that cannot be contained in a diaper,or the child can not reach the toilet in time, the stool may contaminate the childcare home. Protecting Children's Health Sometimes children get diarrhea when they take antibiotics. The children feel andact perfectly well and may not require extra caregiver attention.Children may also eat something (for example prunes, too many strawberries, ormelon) that causes loose stools. If they feel well, do not need extra caregiverattention, and are able to participate fully in the child care program activities, theydo not have to stay home.Children with diarrhea who look or feel sick, or have a fever with their diarrhea,need close attention, need help washing up, or need added fluid intake, should stayhome unless the caregiver can pay close attention to them. Runny NoseChildren with constant runny noses that are not caused by allergies may spreadgerms everywhere. They may wipe their noses with their hands, then rub them ontheir own and other people's clothing and on other surfaces.Remove secretions from children's noses with facial tissues. You may also use asuction bulb for infants and younger children. This will help prevent thesecretions from backing up into the child's ears or sinuses, where they can causesecondary bacterial infection.PainWhen a child is in pain, the child needs a parent's attendon. The parent must takecare of whatever iscausing the pain and must comfort the child.Too sick to fully participateCaregivers care for more then one child. When one child cannot participate, thecaregiver must care for both the ill child and the other children. Unless thecaregiver can provide sick-child care, the child should be cared for elsewhere.

It is typical for a personto come into contact with the virus, develop an infection, and have no problems orsymptoms. In fact, most adults and children live with the virus without even knowing theyhave it. However, there are three groups for whom CMV infection can have very serioushealth effects. These are:1. The unborn children of women who catch CMV for the first time during pregnancy.2. Persons whose natural immunity is weakened because they receive certain drugsor medical treatments such as chemotherapy or organ transplants.3. Persons with an immune deficiency disease such as AIDS.Research shows that there is a higher proportion of CMV infection amongchild care workers and others who work with children as compared to the generalpublic. This is because CMV is common among children and spreads rapidly inenvironments where many children are together. Once children are toddling, placing toysin their mouths, ex:thanging toys, and in close contact with other kids, as many as SO%may become infected.CMV is spread through contact with bodily fluids including saliva, feces, urine,semen, and other secretions. A child care worker has many opportunities to becomeexposed to CMV. Exposure could occur while changing diapers or through contact witha child's saliva. CMV poses no health threat to the children or to the child care workerherself. However, if that child care worker is pregnant, CMV does place the healthof the unborn child at risk.Women who are pregnant and become infected with CMV for the first timemay give CMV to their unborn children. This is called \"congenital CMV disease.\"Some infants infected this way never have symptoms or complications. Others maydevelop symptoms including mental retardation, hearing loss, pneumonia, bleedingproblems, infections of the liver and spleen, and smaller-than-normal head size. About4,000 children born each year in the United States are mentally retarded and/orphysically disabled as a result of CMV infection. In fact, CMV is as common a causeof birth defects as the more widely known Down's Syndrome. Protecting Children's Health If you are caring for children, or are the mother of a child who is in a childcare setting with otherchildren, and you are pregnant or could become pregnant,take precautions. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that youwash your hands often with soap and water and limit your contact with body fluidssuch as urine, feces, and saliva. There is no vaccine for CMV available for general useat the present time. But by following these basic hygiene practices, you can limit yourriskof infection and therefore the chance that you might pass CMV to your unborn child.For more information about CMV, contact your state or county healthdepartment, the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention's automated informa-tion line at 1-404-332-4555, ext 236., or Retarded Citizens/Atlanta, 404-321-0877. 9 1 7Page 18 Protecting Children's Health Special Issue: Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection of the lungs caused by the bacteria Mycobac-terium tuberculosis. TB is transmitted when an infected person coughs the bacteria intothe air and another person inhales the bacteria. In most cases TB is not highly contagious.It usually takes prolonged exposure to the air containing the bacteria to cause infection.For many years the number of reported tuberculosis cases declined. TB wasthought of as a disease of the past. Now tuberculosis is on the rise again. And thedevelopment of some drug resistant strains is making tuberculosis even more dangerousand difficult to treat than before.Children ages 0 to 4 are at the highest risk of developing active TB when exposedto the bnteria. TB can be very serious for children. Without proper treatment TB cancause Meningitis and neurological disorders and can result in permanent disabilities orever death. It is estimated that one case of childhood n3 could cost approximately$200,000 to treat.TB is most often transmitted to a child by a parent or other adult living in the home.In the family situation there is both prolonged exposure and a sharing of breathing space.These same factors are present in the family child care setting. In fact, there have beencases of transmission of TB from adults to children in family child care. Only adults canspread TB to others. TB is not transmitted by children to other children or bychildren to adults. Children do not have enough force behind their coughs to put theTB bacteria in the air.Some states, such as New York, California, and Florida, require family child careproviders and others who work in child care to be tested for TB prior to employment.Because of the rise in TB cases, other states are also considering such a requirement.The National Association for the Education of Young Children, the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics, and the American Public Health Association recommendsthat you and other adults living in your home be tested for TB, even if your state doesnot require it. Early detection of TB not only protects the children in your care, butalso insures early treatment to anyone in your home who has active TB.TB tests are simple, quick, painless and inexpensive. Some states provide TBtests free through county health departments. Call your local health department forinformation on TB testing in your area.(Source: Healthy Young Children: A Manual For Programs. Kendrick, Kaufmann,Messenger (Eds.), National Association for the Education of Young Children, Washing-ton, D.C.) Page 191 Protecting Children's HealthSpecial Issue: Caring for Children with H1V or AIDSMany providers have expressed concern about caring for children with HIV/AIDS. What follows are some questions about HIV/AIDS providers frequently ask andthe answers to those questions. If you don't find the answers to your questions here, callyour local HIV or AIDSinformation line or call the National AIDS Hotline at 1-800-342-2437.What is the risk for HIV/AIDS in child care?HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is not easily spread. To date there is no evidencethat it has been spread through normal contact in child care settings. The virus is not spreadthrough contact with saliva, nasal secretions, mucus, tears, vomit, urine or stool. Thereare no documented casesof transmission of the virus from wiping a runny nose orchanging a diaper.The only possibility of the spread of HIV in the child care setting is throughaccidental blood exposure. Still the risk is very small. Even if a provider comes intocontact with infected bloodwhile tending to a child's scrape or cut, or comes in contactwith a bloody stool, their risk of infection is almost zero. To become infected, the bloodof the infected child would have to get into the blood stream of the provider. This requiresblood to blood contact.Can HIV be spread through biting?There has never been a case where the virus has been spread by biting. Even indocumented cases where a child with HIV/ALDS has bitten another child or an adult andbleeding has resulted, the virus was not transmitted. Similarly, it is very unlikely that anuninfected child can get the virus by biting an infected child. The only way HIV couldbe spread through biting is if blood is exchanged. The only way this could happen is ifthe child who is biting has an open, bleeding sore in his or her mouth and infected bloodpasses from the bite to the sore or from the sore to the bite.Can providers get HIV by handling an infected mother's breastmilk?Breastmilk can contain the virus, but there is a very small risk of transmission tothe provider. To reduce your risk even more, limit your exposure to breastmilk. Suggestthat moms bring breastmilk in bottles and wash your hands before and after feeding.Mat if there is an injury on the playground and a child is bleeding? What shouldI do?The risk of infection from tending to an injured child is extremely slight. Theirblood would have to enter your blood stream through a open bleeding sore or cut that youhave. To minimize risk, have latex or vinyl gloves handy and put them on when tendingto an injured child whois bleeding. However, the American Academy of Pediatricsstresses that you not delay urgent care of a bleeding child if gloves are not available. Therisk of transmission you face is simply to slim to warrant it. Page 20 Protecting Children's Health How can I know if I ant caring for a child who has HIV?You may not always know when you are caring for a child with HIV. A child withI-11V can appear healthy and normal. For this reason you should always protect yourselfby following the universal precautions outlined below. These precautions will prevent thespread of HIV and all other communicable diseases.What should I do to minimize the risk of transmission in my family child care home?You should always follow universal precautions. These practices will prevent thespread of all communicable diseases, from colds to HIV. Use these practices will allchildren at all times.1. Minimize contact with blood and body fluids, especially skin lesions and stool.2. Keep all skin wounds and lesions covered with a clean bandage that does not allowblood or other body fluids to pass through.3. Do not share personal items such as pacifiers, toothbrushes, or razors. All items thatare washed between uses, eating utensils, linens , etc. may be shared.4. Handwashing is the best prevention against the spread of all infections from thecommon cold to HIV. Refer back to page 7 in this chapter for more informadonon proper handwashing procedures.5. Latex or vinyl gloves should be used for all contact with blood, bloody stool,wounds, or oozing skin rashes. Keep them with you when children are playingoutside in case a child is injured and bleeding and needs immediate attention.6. Clean all soiled surfaces with disposable paper towels and disinfect with a bleachand water solution. Page 9 of this chapter provides instructions for making yourown sanitizing solution using household bleach and water.7. Dispose of all contaminated items, like paper towels, diapers, gloves and wounddressings, in a covered trash can lined with a disposable plastic bag.8. Soiled clothes and linens should be placed in a covered container lined with adisposable plastic bag. They should be washed as soon as possible in hot water withsoap and bleach, separate from other laundry.Can I refuse to care for a child infected with the virus?No. Children with HIV are protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act.For more information about caring for children with HIV/A1DS or other special needs,call the Action for Better Child Care at 404-634-7110.Is a child with HIV/AIDS likely to die in my care?No. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, makes an infected person sick by weakeningtheir immune system. Eventually the immune system is so weak that the child becomessusceptible to many illnesses that an uninfected child could easily fight off. It is extremelyunlikely that you would be asked to care for a child with such a weakened immune system.Being around other children, and being exposes to the illnesses they might carry, is toorisky for the child with HIV. By the time a child has developed AIDS and may be neardeath, they would not be in your care.

Don't let the warnings about foodbomeillnesses discourage you. Instead, when you review the informa-tion on foodborne illnesses and how to prevent them, rememberthat you will need to pass this information along to your younghelpers. Teaching children how to prevent foodbome illness, liketeaching them about foods and nutrition, is all part of the healtheducation you can provide to the children in your care. Page 24 Protecting Children's Health PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Day Care Provider Should Know Foodborne illnesses are much morecommon than most people believe. The mostcommon symptoms of foodborne illnesses areupset stomachs, abdominal pains, diarrhea,and sometimes headaches. Estimates are that asmany as 2 million cases of foodborne illness ayear are mistaken for the flu or a 24 hour stomachvirus. But not all foodborne illnesses come and goso quickly. Some are much more serious and inextreme cases can be fatal. Foodborne illnessescan be particularly serious for certain groupsof people including infants and children, preg-nant women, and the elderly.There are two major kinds of foodborneillnesses. Both are caused by microorganisms orbacteria and produce similar symptoms. Theseare:1. Food PoisoningFood poisoning is caused by eating foodscontaminated with poison or toxins producedby the microorganisms. The microorganismsthemselves are killed in the cooking, but thepoison that remains makes us ill.2. Food InfectionFood infection is caused by ingestingthe microorganisms themselves. Once eatenthese live bacteria continue to live and grow inour bodies. There are 4 common sources of foodbomeillnesses. These are salmonella, clostridiumperfringens, staphylococcus (known as staph)and clostridium botulinum, the toxin that causesbotulism. (For more information about thesesources of foodborne illness, see the SupportingInformation on page 29.)With proper food handling, you canprevent these microorganisms fromcausing illness in your family day carehome. This includes taking care to pur-chase safe foods, storing them properlyand preparing and serving them safely.

Page 26 Protecting Children's Health PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know Since bacteria grows best in moist, warmconditions, it is no surprise that we find bacteriain our food. Temperature and time are themajor factors that influence the growth ofbacteria.Most foodborne illness is caused bybacteria that multiply rapidly at temperaturesbetween 60 and 125 degrees Fahrenheit. Thelonger foods are left at this temperature, thegreater the opportunity for the growth of bac-teria. Keep hot foods hotandcold foods cold.To control the growth of bacteria thatmay already be present infood, it isimportant to maintain the internal tem-perature of cooked foods that will beserved hot at 140 degrees or hotter.The internal temperature of foods thatwill be served cold should be kept at 40degrees or below. Here are some additional hints about con-trolling bacteria with heat and cold.When foods are boiled, baked, roasted, orfried, they reach temperatures from 160 to212 degrees Fahrenheit.This kills mostbacteria that can cause foodborne illness.Prompt refrigeration at 40 degrees Fahren-heit or below in containers that are less than2 inches deep inhibits the growth of most, butnot all, of these bacteria.Freezing foods at 0 degrees Fahrenheit orbelow essentially stops bacteria from multi-plying. However, freezing will not kill bacte-ria that are already present in food. In orderto kill these bacteria, food must be reheatedthoroughly to an internal temperature of 165degrees Fahrenheit or above.Even with reheating, foods that have beenimproperly stored or otherwise mishandledcannot be made safe. Reheatin g cannot elimi-nate dangerous toxins produced by somebacteria. These foods should be thrown away.Consult the thermometer chart on thefollowing page for more information on control-ling bacteria with heat and cold.(From: Preventing Foodborne Illness: A Guide to SafeFood Handling, Home and Garden Bulletin #247, Septem-ber 1990, United States Department of Agriculture, FoodSafety and Inspection Service.) Protecting Children's Health Temperatures for the Control of Bacteria Canning temperatures for fruits,tomatoes, and pickles in water-bath canner.250240 Warming temperatures preventgrowth but allow some bacteria tosurvive.

Cooking temperatures that destroy mostbacteria. The time required to kill bacte-ria decreases as temperature is increased.In other words, the higher the tempera-ture, the less time the food must becooked to kill the bacteria. The lower thetemperature, the longer the food must becooked to kill the bacteria. Many bacteria survive; some may grow. DANGER ZONE. Temperatures in thiszone allow rapid growthof bacteria andproduction of toxins by some bacteria. Cold temperatures permit slow growth ofsome bacteria that causespoilage. Page 28' r;f3 the Bacteria That CauseFoodborne illnessesSupporting InformationFor the Provider Who Wants To Know More Here is some additional information aboutthe 4 major bacterias that cause foodborne ill-nesses and how you can protect the children inyour child care home.SalmonellaSources:Salmonella bacteria are often found in rawmeats, poultry, eggs, milk, fish, and productsmade from them. They may spread to otherfoods through cross-contamination. Cross-con-tamination takes place when a contaminatedfood comes in contact with and spreads thebacteria to a previously uncontaminated food.For example, let's suppose you were shoppingfor groceries and you loaded your cart in such away that the juices from meats dripped on yourapples. This allows cross-contamination. Thesalmonella bacteria is allowed to spread fromthe meat to the apple. In addition, because youdo not plan to cook the apple the salmonellabacteria will not be killed by heat. Salmonellacan not be detected by taste or odor of food. Youcould ingest or serve contaminated foods with-out knowing it.DiseaseAbout 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are re-ported each year. Salmonella bacteria can liveand grow in anyone's digestive tract once con-taminated food is eaten. Symptoms of infectionoccur within 12 to 36 hours after eating. Theyinclude severe headache, vomiting, diarrhea,stomach cramps, fever and chills. Illness usu-ally appears 6 to 48 hours after eating and lastsfrom two to seven days. Infants and youngchildren,the ill, and the elderly may be seri-ously affected. Illness is rarely fatal exceptamong infants or elderly persons whose resis-tance to illness is low.PreventionHeat destroys the salmonella bacteria. Thor-oughly cook all meat, poultry, fish and eggs.Warm leftovers thoroughly. Bring broths andgravies to a full boil. Do not drink unpasteurizedmilk. Avoid contaminating cooked foods withjuices from raw foods. Avoid cross contamina-tion by immediately cleaning surfaces and equ ip-ment, (including your hands), that have touchedraw or possibly contaminated foods before theyhave a chance to contaminate other foods, sur-faces or equipment. Staphylococcus aureus (Staph)Sources:Staph bacteria are found on our skin, in infectedcuts and pimples, and in our noses and throats.They are spread by improper food handling.Staph can multiply rapidly at warm tempera-tures to produce a toxin that causes illness.Staph bacteria prefer cooked food high in pro-tein. They also grow well in foods high in sugaror salt, which inhibits the growth of moresensitive microorganisms.Disease:Symptoms of staph intoxication include nausea,vomiting, and diarrhea that usually appear 30 Page 297 Protecting Children's Health minutes to 8 hours after eating and may last aday or two. The illness is usually not serious inhealthy people.Prevent ionWash hands and utensils before preparing andserving food. Refrigerate, in shallow, coveredcontainers, cooked foods that will not be servedimmediately. Don't let prepared foods- particu-larly cooked and cured meats and cheese andmeat salads- sit at room temperature more than2 hours. Thorough cooking destroys staph bac-teria, but staph toxin is resistant to heat, refrig-eration and freezing. Therefore, once staph hasbeen allowed to contaminate a food andcreate the toxins, the food can not be madesafe to eat. Contaminated food should not beeaten.Clostridium perfringensSourceClostridium bacteria are more widespread overthe earth than any other disease-causing organ-ism. They are present in the soil, in the intestinesof humans and animals, and in sewage. Clos-tridium perfringens bacteria is called the \"caf-eteria germ\" because it often strikes food servedin quantity and left for long periods on a steamtable or at room temperature. Clostridium bac-teria can be present as a vegetative cell or aspore. The vegetative cellsproduce the toxinsthat cause i\"ness. Thorough cooking will killthe vegetative cells, but will not kill the spores.At temperatures between 70 and 120 degi ees,the spores vegetative and producethe toxin.DiseaseSymptoms of perfringens enteritisinclude diarrhea and gas pains that appear within9 to 15 hours and last about 1 day. Elderlypeople and ulcer patients can be affected moreseriously.PreventionDivide large portions of cooked foods such asbeef, turkey, gravy, dressing, stews, and casse-roles into smaller portions for serving and cool-ing. Keep cooked foods hot (at an internaltemperature of 140 defFees or above) or cold (at40 degrees or below). Reheat leftovers thor-oughly (to an internal temperature of at least165 degrees) before serving and bring leftovergravy to a rolling boil. Keepcold sliced meatsand cold cuts below 40 degrees and serve themcold.Clostridium BotulinumSourceClosthdium botulinum bacteria are present inthe soil and water. Like clostridium, it may bepresent as a vegetative cell or as a spore. Thevegetative cells produce the toxin that causesillness. While thorough cooking will kill thevegetative cells, some of the spores may sur-vive. At temperatures above 38 degrees thespores can become vegetative and produce thetoxin. The risk of botulism has long been asso-ciated with canned foods that are not processedto a high enough temperature to kill all of thespores. More recently, it has been associatedwith cooked foods held at room or warm tern-perature for an extended time under conditionswhere oxygen is limited- mounded cooked on-ions in butter, potatoes wrapped tightly in foil,meat pies and vacuum packed foods. DiseaseBotulism toxin affects the nervous system andcan be fatal if not treated.Symptoms appear 12to 48 hours after eating and include doublevision, droopy eyelids, trouble speaking andswallowing, and difficult breathing. Withouttreatment, a person can die of suffocation be-cause the nerves nolonger stimulate breathing. Page 30 There are antitoxins, which have reduced thenumber of deaths from botulism, but personsmay suffer nerve damage, and recovery is oftenslow.PreventionDivide large portions of cooked foods intosmaller portions for serving and cooling. Keepcooked foods hot (at an internal temperature of140 degrees or above) or cold (at 40 degrees orbelow). Reheat leftovers thoroughly (to an in-ternal temperature of at least 165 degrees) be-fore serving. Outbreaks of botulism are rarelyassociated with commercially canned products.Protecting Children's Health Home canners should follow established guide-lines for canning. Do not taste food from leak-ing, bulging, or damaged cans; from crackedjars or jars with loose or bulging lids; fromcontainers that spurt liquid when opened; or anycanned food that has an abnormal odor orappearance.

Protecting Children's Health PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know SpoilageWhen foods have not been stored properly, orhave simply been kept too long, you begin to seesigns of deterioration caused by microorgan-isms. This is referred to as food spoilage. Ingeneral, it is best to throw away any food thathas begun to spoil and that has an uncharacter-istic color, odor, texture or flavor. For moreinformation about how long foods can safely bestored, see the primary information on page 39.MoldMold does not necessarily mean that you haveto throw away a food item. The density of a foodeffects whether or not the entire item has beencontaminated. If there is only a small area ofmold on a piece of hard block cheese, hardsalami, or a dry cured country ham, the food canbe salvaged. Cut out an inch of the productsurrounding and below the moldy area. Keepthe knife out of the mold itself and re-cover thefood in fresh wrap. Any other visibly moldyfoods-soft cheeses, sour cream, hotdogs, lunchmeats, baked chicken, soft fruits and vegetables,bread, cake, flour, rice, peanut butter, etc.--should be thrown away. To avoid spreading themold spores, gently wrap the food or place it ina bag before discarding. Be sure to examineother items that the moldy food may havecontacted. Clean the refrigerator or containerthat held the item as necessary.(From: Preventing Foodborne Illness: A Guide toSafe Food Handling, Home and Garden Bulletin#247, September 1990, United States Departmentof Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Ser-vice.) a111Protecting Children's Health PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should KnowParasites are organisms that depend onnutrients from a living host to complete their lifecycle. There are several parasites that can infecthumans through the food chain. The two mostcommon illnesses that result from eating foodcontaminated with parasites are trichinosisand toxoplasmosis.TrichinosisHumans may contract trichinosis, causedby Trichinella spiralis, by or game that is infested with trichina larvae.Much progress has been made in reducingtrichinosis in grain fed hogs and human cases areon the decline. Thorough home cooking willdestroy any live trichina larvae that may be presentin pork or other meat. Other proven trichinadestruction methods used by industry under care-fully controlled conditions- include curing, pick-ling, freezing, and cooking and canning.ToioplasmosisToxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasrnosagondii, is a common parasite infection in cats thatcan be transferred directly to humans through catfeces, or indirectly through improperly cookedmeat or poultry. It is a particular risk for pregnantwomen. The consequences of infection are mostsevere for the infant who acquires the parasitefrom an infected mother before birth.To prevent infection, cook meat, par-ticularly lamb and pork, thoroughly. Keepthe cat litter box away from the food prepara-tion and cooking areas and out of the reach ofchildren. If you have a sand box outsick 2 wherechildren play, keep it covered when childrenare not using it. Cats, including those that do riotbelong to you, may see the children's sand box asan especially roomy litter box. Pregnant womenshould limit their exposure to cats that may beinfected, wash their hands after handling cats.and have someone else change the cat litter box.

Protecting Children's Health PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Day Care Provider Should Know Your role in preventing foodborne ill-nesses actually begins with purchasing safefoods and keeping frozen and refrigeratedfoods safe until you can get them home and inthe freezer or refrigerator. Here are somesuggestions that will help.When you're out, grocery shop last. Take foodstraight home to the refrigerator. Never leavefood in a hot car.Don't buy food in damaged containers. Theyare not a good bargain. Cans or glass jars withdents, cracks or bulging lids could be a sign thatthe food is contaminated or spoiled.Buy food from reputable dealers with knownrecords of safe food handling.Buy dated products only if the \"sell by\" or\"use by\" date has not expired and if you planto use them before the use-by date. Keep inmind that these dates are reliable only if the foodhas been kept at the proper temperature duringstorage and handling.Buy products labeled \"keep refrigerated\"only if they are stored in a refrigerated caseand are cold to the touch.Buy frozen products only if they are frozensolid.Do not buy packaged precooked foods withtorn or damaged packages.Always place individual packages of rawmeat and poultry in plastic bags before plac-ing them in your shopping cart and grocerybag with other foods. The juices that drip fromthe meats could contaminate other food prod-ucts, especially foods that will be eaten withoutfurther cooking. Always position packages ofraw meat and poultry so that ifjuices do leak,they will not drip on other food peoducts.Shop for perishables last. Keep refrigeratedand frozen items together so that they willremain cold. Place perishables in the coolestpart of your car during the trip home. Packthem in an ice chest if time from the store tohome will be more than 1 hour.

Protecting Children's Health PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Day Care Provider Should Know After you have purchased safe foods, yournext challenge is to store them properly and keepthem safe until they are cooked and eaten. Thefollowing recommendations will help you.Check the temperature of your refrigerator withan appliance thermometer you can buy at ahardware or variety stor:,. To keep bacteria incheck, the refrigerator should run at 40 de-grees Fahrenheit and the freezer at 0 degreesFa hrenheit. Generally keep your refri gerator ascold as possible without freezing your milk orlettuce.Make sure raw meat and poultry are wrappedsecurely so that they do not leak and contami-nate other foods. Leave the product in the storewrap unless it is torn.Put packages of raw meat, poultry or fish ona plate before refrigerating so their juiceswon't drip on other food. Raw juices oftencontain bacteria.Freeze fresh meat, poultry, or fish immedi-ately if you can't use it within a few days. Ifyou plan to store it in the freezer for more thana couple of months, use freezer wrap, freezer-quality bags, or aluminum foil over commercialwrap so that the product stays fresher.Keep eggs in the carton in which they cameand store them on an inside shelf of therefrigerator. Dli not use the egg trays thatcome mounted on the doors of some refrig-erators. Repeated opening and closing of thedoor causes temperature fluctuations and canresult in breakage. In addition, the egg cartonseggs come in protect eggs from picking upodors and flavors of other foods in your refrig-erator and helps prevent the loss of carbondioxide and moisture from the eggs-- a par-ticularly important factor if you have a frost-free refrigerator. Store eggs with the large endup to keep the yolk centered.Keep canned goods and dry goods like drybeans and flour in a cool, dry place. Usethem within 12 to 18 months.

Page 447 Protecting Children's Health 0PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know The following suggestions will help youto prepare foods safely. They are also importantlessons for the children to learn. When childrenare helping you prepare snacks and meals,always begin with handwashing. Stress theimportance of using clean utensils and equip-ment and be careful that children do not tastefoods containing raw or not fully cooked eggs,meat, poultry or fish.Wash your hands in hot soapy water beforepreparing food and after using the bathroom,changing diapers and handling pets. If childrenare helping you prepare the foods or set the table,make sure they wash their hands also. Alwayswash your hands in the bathroom sink. Thekitchen sink should be reserved for food prepa-ration and should be kept as clean as possible.If there is any kind of cut or infection on yourhands, use rubber or plastic gloves.Do not sneeze or cough on foods.Bacteria can live in kitchen towels, sponges, andcloths. Wash towels and cloths daily. If a spongeis used for dishwashing it should be kept in a dishof soaking solution that is made fresh dai ly. (Seepage 9, #3.)Wash fresh fruits and vegetables wi th plainwater to remove pesticide residues arid otherimpurities like soil particles.Keep raw meat, poultry and fish and their juicesaway from other food. For instance, wash yourhands, cutting board, and knife in hot soapywater after cutting up chicken and before dicingsalad ingredients.Don't taste any food of animal origin when it israw or while it is cooking.Use plastic cutting boards rather than woodenones where bacteria can hide in grooves.Keep your refrigerator clean. Wipe spills imme-diately and keep all surfaces sanitized.Thaw food in the microwave (follow themanufacturer's directions) or refrigerator, noton the kitchen counter. When food thaws on thekitchen counter, bacteria can grow in the outerlayers of the food before the inside thaws.Foods thawed properly, for example in therefrigerator, can be safely refrozen.For faster thawing, put the package of frozenfood in a water tight plastic bag and put it in cold(not hot) water. Change the water every 30minutes. The cold water temperature slows bac-terial growth that may occur on the outer thawedportions while the inner areas are still thawing.Marinate foods in the refrigerator. Do not allowthem to marinate while sitting out on the kitchencounter. Leaving foods on the counter allowsthem to become infected with bacteria.(From: Preventing Foodborne Illness: A Guide to SafeFood Handling, Home and Garden Bulletin #247, Septem-ber 1990, United States Department of Agriculture, FoodSafety and Inspection Service.)Page 45S Protecting Children's Health PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know Bacteria thrive and grow in some tem-peratures and are killed by other tempera-tures. This is why the way that you cook foodshas so much to do with keeping foods safe.Follow these guidelines.Cook foods thoroughly. It takes thoroughcooking to kill harmful bacteria. Do not eatraw or partially cooked meat, poultry, fish, oreggs. This includes hamburger patties that arered in the middle and rare and medium raresteaks and roast beef.Completely cook meat and poultry at onetime. Avoid interrupting the cooking before thefood is done and returning later to finish it.Cook red meat to 160 degrees Fahrenheit.Cook poultry to 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Usea meat thermometer to check that it's cooked allthe way through. For red meat, insert the tip oft le thermometer into the thickest part avoidingb.)ne, fat or gristle. For poultry, insert the tip ofth t thermometer in the thick part of the thigh.When cooking frozen meat or poultry thathas not been defrosted, cook it about 1-1/2times the length of time required for the samecut when it is thawed.To check visually, red meat is done when it isbrown or grey inside. Poultry is done whenits juices run clear. Fish is done when it flakeswith a fork.Cooking temperatures in conventional ovensshould beat least 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Donot use recipes that call for cooking without areliable and continuous heat source.Salmonella, a bacteria that causes food poi-soning, can grow inside fresh, unbroken eggs.To kill salmonella bacteria, cook eggs untilthe yolk and white are firm, not runny.Scramble eggs to a firm texture. Don't userecipes in which eggs remain raw or onlypartially cooked.When using a slow cooker, cook food for atleast 2 hours. It takes that long for slow cookersto heat food to the temperature that kills bacte-ria. Do not fill the cooker more than 2/3 full andalways keep covered with the lid. Check theinternal temperature to be sure food is thor-oughly cooked to at least 160 degrees Fahren-heit.When you cook ahead, divide large portionsof food into small, shallow containers forrefrigeration. This ensures safe, rapid coolingand does not give time for bacteria to grow.

Page 47 9(f) Protecting Children's Health Special Issue: SafeMicrowaving Microwaves are a great timesaver in the kitchen. However, they have one foodsafety disadvantage. They sometimes leave cold spots in food where bacteria can survive.To help prevent this, follow these suggestions. Cover food with a lid or plastic wrap so steam can aid thorough cooking. Vent wrap andmake sure it doesn't touch the food.Stir and rotate your food for even cooking. If your microwave is not equipped with aturntable, rotate the dish 1/4 turn once or twice during cooking. Follow the recipe or packaged foods directions for letting foods stand after cooking.During the standing time, food finishes cooking. Use the oven temperature probe or a meat thermometer to check that food is done. Insertit at several spots.Never use a microwave oven to heat baby bottles or baby food.

Page 48 Protecting Children's Health PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know Foods that are being served can become abreeding ground for bacteria. Follow these sug-gestions to keep foods you are serving safefrom the bacteria that causes foodborne ill-nesses.Wash hands with soap and water for at least20 seconds before preparing, eating or serv-ing food.Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Foodsheld at room temperature for more than 2 hoursduring serving should be thrown away.Never leave perishable food out of the refrig-erator over 2 hours. Bacteria that can causefood poisoning grow quickly at warm tempera-tures. Refrigerate leftovers as soon after eadngas possible.Fresh foods should not be added to a servingdish or platter containing foods that havealready been out for serving.Use clean dishes and utensils to serve food, notthose used in preparat:an. Serve grilled foodon a clean plate, not the one that held the rawmeat, poultry, or fish.Pack lunches in insulated carriers with a coldpack. Caution children never to leave lunchesin the direct sun or near a heat source.When using a thermos for hot food, rinse thethermos with boiling water just before using.Bring the soup or other hot food to as high atemperature as possible before pouring it inthe thermos. The food should be too hot totouch at serving time.Carry picnic food in a cooler with a cold pack.When possible, put the cooler in the shade.Make sure food is cold or frozen before youplace it in the cooler. Keep the lid on thecooler as much as you can.If you c7re picnicking and soap and water arenot available, clean your hands with dispos-able, wet handwipes before and after work-ing with food.When you have a party, keep cold party foodon ice or serve it throughout the party fromplatters from the refrigerator. Likewise, di-vide hot party foods into smaller servingplatters. Keep platters refrigerated until timeto warm them up for serving.Home canned foods, wild game and homeslaughtered meats should not be served today care children and are not creditable bythe Child and Adult Care Food Program.

Page 49(1 P71 Protecting Children's Health PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care P;.ovider Should Know Leftovers can be an important part of yourmenu plan. By using them wisely you can saveboth time and money. However, leftovers that arenot stored or reheated correctly can become in-fected with ihe bacterias that cause foodborneillnesses. To use leftovers safely, follow theseguidelines.Wash hands before handling leftovers anduse clean utensils and surfaces.Divide large amounts of leftovers into small,covered, shallow containers (less than 2 inchesdeep) for quick cooling in the refrigerator.Don't pack the refrigerator- cool air mustcirculate to keep food cool and safe.Date leftovers so that they can be used withina safe time. Avoid tasting old leftovers.With poultry or other stuffed meats, removethe stuffing and refrigerate it in separatecontainers.When reheating sauces, soups and gravy,bring them to a boil. Heat other leftoversthoroughly to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.When microwaving leftovers, cover with a lidor plastic wrap for thorough heating.Never taste food that looks or smells strangeto see if you can use it. If in doubt, throw itout. Dispose of possibly unsafe leftovers in thegarbage disposal or in tightly wrapped or closedpackages so that foods cannot be consumed bypeople or animals.Most moldy foods should be thrown away.The poisons molds can form are found mostlyunder the surface of food. You can sometimessave hard cheese and salamis and firm fruits andvegetables by cutting the mold out. But don'tonly remove the mold you see. To be safe youshould also remove a large area arouna themold.

This sectionprovides additional information on handling some of those \"special care\" foods.Ground Meat and Ground PoultryBecause of the grinding and mixing process, ground meat and ground poultry arehandled more than other cuts of meat. Therefore they are more likely to be contaminatedby bacteria. To destroy any bacteria that might be present in ground meat or groundpoultry, cook it thoroughly. Patties should be cooked until they are hot, steaming, and thejuices run clear, with no evidence of pink color in the center. When preparing a meatloafor casserole, use a meatthermometer to make sure it cooks to at least 160 degreesFahrenheit.HainHam is the meat from the leg or shoulder of the pig. It may be \"fresh\" (uncured),cured, or smoked. Hams are sold plastic-wrapped, vacuum-packaged in plastic, in a can,or country style. Whenpurchasing a ham, read the label carefully. The label will tell youif the ham is cured or smoked, if it is \"fully-cooked,\" and if it must be refrigerated.Hams labeled \"fully cooked\" can be served cold or reheated to an internaltemperature of 140 degreesFahrenheit. All other hams must be cooked to an internaltemperature of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit before serving.Both plastic-wrapped and vacuum-packaged plasdc-wrapped hams must berefrigerated. keep abcut one week. A vacuum-packaged hamshould be consumed by the \"use by\" date or within one week plastic-wrapped and vacuum-packed plastic-wrapped hams can be frozen.To preserve texture and flavor in the freezer, wrap the ham fightly in an extra layer offreezer paper or plastic and use within two months.Canned hams labeled \"keep refrigerated\" require refrigeration and, unopened,will keep 6 to 9 months in the refrigerator. Make sure the can is not showing any bulges,cracks, dents, or rust, or leaking any liquid. A canned ham should not be frozen. Shelf-stable canned hams do not require refrigeration and may be stored in a cool, dry place for2 to 5 years.Country style hams are dry-cured with salt and aged for a distinctive flavor. Somecountry style hams are also smoked. Unopened country style hams can be kept up to 1year without refrigeration. Once the ham is cut, exposing the moist interior, in must bestored in the refrigerator and should be used within 2 to 3 months. After the ham has beensoaked, or soaked and cooked, it should be used within 5 days.Hotdogs and Lunch MeatsHotdogs and lunch meats are processed to last longer than many other meat andpoultry products. However, some bacteria can grow slowly during refrigeration. There-fore, it is important to use, freeze, or throw away these products within the recommended Page 52 Protecting Children's Health length of time.Hotdogs and lunch meats will keep in the original vacuum-sealed pouch for 2weeks. They should never be kept longer than 1 week after the sell-by date, unless frozen.When freezing these products, do so as soon as po ssible after purchase. Freezing may leadto loss of flavor and texture after 1 to 2 months.Watch the liquid that often forms around hotdogs. If it's cloudy, it can be a signthat spoilage bacteria have started growing. Throw away hotdogs with cloudy liquid.Once a package of hotdogs or lunch meat is opened, rewrap it well and plan to usehotdogs in 1 week, lunch meats in 3 to 5 days.Eggs and Egg-Rich FoodsDue to the possibility of contamination with salmonella or other bacteria, it isimportant to handle eggs and egg-rich foods properly. Follow these practices:Buy grade AA or A eggs with clean, uncracked shells.Do not buy unrefrigerated eggs.Refrigerate eggs in the original carton.Cook eggs thoroughly--until the yolk is not runny and the white is firm. Cook scrambledeggs until firm.Avoid foods that contain raw eggs, such as Caesar salad or hnemade mayonnaise, icecream or eggnog.Avoid foods that contain lightly cooked eggs such as chilled chocolate mousse or softmeringues that are only slightly cooked.Eggs and egg-rich foods should never be kept out of the refrigerator for more than 2hours, including serving time.To ensure safe Easter eggs, do not leave hard-cooked dyed eggs at room temperaturefor more than 2 hours. Hard-cooking an egg destroys much of its natural protection andmakes it more susceptible to bacterial growth.MayonnaiseContrary to what many people believe, adding commercial mayonnaise to fooddoes not increase the chances that it will cause foodborne illness. Commercial mayon-naise is made with pasteurized eggs. In addition, most commercially prepared mayon-naise contains ingredients such as vinegar, lemon juice, and salt, which slow the growthof bacteria. Page 534 Protecting Children's Health Shelf-Stable ProductsShelf-stable products packaged in plastic containers, foil packages, waxed parercartons, metal cans, and glass jars have extended shelf lives. However, this does not meanthat they :last forever. There are limits to how long these foods processing methods canpreserve foods. Here are some tips on using these products wisely: Check the labels on unfamiliar products eiat look shelf stable to be sure that they do notrequire refrigeration. Also check the package for a \"sell by\" or \"use by\" date.Store shelf-stable products in a cool (below 85 degrees F), clean, dry place. When storing products in the pantry, place newly purchased packages behind older onesso that each package canbe used within its recommended shelf life. Carefully check package conditions before use. Most foods in plastic, foil, or paper thathas been punctured or torn should be thrown away. An exception to this would be riceor noodles with no visiblecontaminants like pests or mold.In general, high-acid canned foods (for example tomatoes, grapefruit, pineapple) canbe stored in the cabinet for 12-18 months; low-acid canned foods (for example stew,carrots, spinach) will keep 2 tr 5 years, without loosing quality.As a safety precaution, boil all low-acid home-canned foods for at least 10 minutesbefore serving. Add 1 minute of boiling time for every 1,000 feet above sea level. Leaking, bulging, badly dented, or rusted cans; cracked jars or jars with loose bulginglids; foods with a foul odor, or any container that spurts liquid when you open it mayindicate the presence of the bacteria that causes botulism. If possible, avoid openingsuch foods. Never taste them.Report any suspect commercially canned foods to your local health department. Todispose of suspect home-canned products, it is best to enclose the food, in its originalcontainer, in a heavy garbage bag marked \"POISON\" and place the bag in a trashcontainer that is not accessible to homeless people, children, or animals. If a suspect canned food is opened in your kitchen, thoroughly scrub the can opener orother utensil, containers, counters, etc., that might have contacted the food or itscontainer. Throw away any sponges or cloths used in the cleanup. Wash your handsthoroughly. Launder any clothing that might have been splattered upon as soon aspossible.

Screeningsusually include taking measurements of growthand development, checking vision and hearing,testing for lead exposure and tuberculosis. With-out screenings, problems may go unnoticed andmay result in more serious health problems thatcould have been avoided.Ask the parents if they have receivedhealth screenings for their children. If not, recom-mend that they do so. Suggest that they see theirhealth care provider or call the local county healthdepartment. Page 3 Healthy Children in Safe Environments PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know Getting plenty of exercise is importantto a healthy childhood and to the developmentof habits that will help children be healthyadults. Even in cold weather children can bebundled up to play outdoors for a short time.Unfortunately, studies show that childrenget less physical exercise today than ever before.Instead they are spending more and more time infront of the television. The television and videogames can be pretty tough competition for morephysical activities like dodge ball and hide-and-go-seek. However, while you can not make a childexercise, you can make rules that limit their T.V.viewing.Establish a regular time for physicalactivities and give children a safe place inwhich to run and play.Be prepared for rainy days by developingsome indoor activities that get childrenmoving.Make sure that the games or activities areappropriate for children of their age andstage of development and emphasize par-ticipation and effort rather than winningor loosing.Remember: Some children enjoy physi-cal activity more than others. You can notmake them exercise and you should nottry. Your job is to give them the opportu-nity, a little encouragement, and to keepit fun.If you have a yard where children can playsafely, it will be easy for you to provide anopportunity for active play. If not, it may takesome extra effort on your part. Try taking childrenfor a walk, or to a nearby park to play. Considermeeting another provider and her children for anafternoon in the park. There are also games andactivities that can be played safely indoors. Fora few suggestions, see the following page. 279Page 5 Healthy Children in Safe Environments Make sure the children you care for get exercise every day. When you can't go outside, try these indoor activities.Have fun to music. Most children love todance. All you need to do is simply turn on theradio and give them a little encouragement.You can also purchase tapes and records madefor children. Some of these feature musicalgames or instruct children tomake particularmovements to the music.Play games with nerf balls. Nerf balls are softballs made of foam that are safe for indoorplay. Try letting the children takes turns throw-ing the ball into the laundry basket or a papersack. Place the sack on its side and let them tryto roll the nerf ball into thesack.Play \"walk the line.\" Using masking tape,make a straight line on the floor. Can thechildren walk the line without \"falling off?\"Play \"Guess what animal I am?\" Let eachchild have a turn at acting like their favoriteanimal while the other children try to identifythe animal. At first try using only movements.If no one can identify the animal, try addingsounds.Make an obstacle course using items inyour home. For example, make a hill with apile of pillows and have the children lie ontheir sides and roll over it. Use the backs oftwo chairs and a blanket to make a tunnel.Have the children squat down and sitting ontheir heels, waddle like a duck through thetunnel.Play \"follow the leader\" or \"do as I do.\"Lead the children on the first round and keepthem active. This will also give them ideas forthe kinds of moves they can do when it is theirturn as leader. Keep in mind tha children canget exercise by walking in place. They don'thave to literall; move through the house tokeep moving. Remember to move the upperpart of the body as well as the lower part andto use slow, stretching movement as well asquick movements. Make the activities safe, fun,non-competitive, and age appropriate.Praise children for participation and for effort. Page 6 Healthy Children in Safe Environments Special Issue: Obesity Obesity can be a serious problem for a child, both in terms of physical health andin terms of psychological health. Between 1965 and 1985, obesity among children hasincreased by 50%. Fifty percent of hypertension in children is related to obesity and onein 4 children have elevated cholesterol levels.If you care for an overweight or obese child the temptation may be to restrict thatchild' s food intake. At times a parent may ask you to put his or her child on a diet.Regardless of the child's weight, do not restrict the child's food intake unless the childis under the supervision of a physician. Obesity is a very complex issue. Restrictivediets are seldom the answer. For children, a restrictive diet could create serious healthproblems. Restricting a child's diet could lead to a loss of protein and could resultin impaired growth, hair loss, gallstones and other health problems.Follow the dietary guidelines for Americans unless a physician tells youotherwise. In most cases, you will find that overweight children will loose weightnaturally if you lower the fat content of the foods you serve (only for children over 2 yearsold), limit the amount of T.V. viewing and provide opportunity and encouragement forincreased levels of physical activity. If you believe a child's weight problem could beserious, or if the parents continue to express their concern, recommend taking the childto see a health care professional.Never restrict a child's diet unless you have been told to do so by a health careprovider. As a provider., your responsibility in preventing obesity in children is to:reduce the fat intake for children over 2 years old.limit the amount of T.V children vatch.increase their level of physical activity. rl 9 Page 7 Healthy Children in Safe Environments PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know A time for rest or quiet play is importantfor the children and for the provider. Establish aregular rest time. Don't try to force children whoare not sleepy to nap, but let them look at a bookor engage in some other quiet, restful activity. Besure they don't interfere with other children whowish to nap or with your own rest or quiet activity.At times you may have a child who ap-pears to be more tired and sleepy than the otherchildren. Remember that you may not be aware ofall that is going on in the child's home. A tempo-rary pmblem or stress situation in the child's homemay have caused him or her to lose sleep. Beflexible enough to allow the child extra tdme fornapping Children who are not properly immunized run the riskof getting very serious diseases which are 100% pre-ventable through immunization. Their disease couldthen spread to other children who lack immunizations.It is your responsibility, in assuring the health of thechildren in your care, to see that the parents have theirchildren properly immunized and provide you withproof of their immunizations. .011111,Healthy Children in Safe Environments PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know All 50 states and the District of Columbiahave laws requiring immunizations for enteringschool and for attending child care. Still, nation-wide, only about 70 to 80 percent of youngchildren are properly immunized. In some ruraland inner city areas only 50% of young childrenare properly immunized. Most of the young chil-dren who are not properly immunized are pre-school age.Ask parents for proof of their children'simmunization and keep a copy for your files.If children are not immunized, instruct the parenton what to do. Make extra copies of the chart onthe following page to give to the parents ofchildren who are not properly immunized. Sug-gest that they call their health care provider or theCounty Health Department for more informa-tion.

Page 12p 4 Healthy Children in Safe Environments Special Issue: Measles Epidemic Before the measles vaccine received approval in 1963, an average of more than500,000 cases of measles were reported each year, killing 4C2 500 people. In the last fewyears there has been a resurgence of measles in the United States. Some 45,000 cases ofmeasles and approximately 120 deaths were reported for 1989 and 1990. Nearly half ofthese cases occurred in preschool children who were not vaccinated.The biggest cause of the measles epidemic is the failure to immunize youngchildren at an early enough age. Insist on seeing proof of a child's immunizationbefore accepting a child for care. Keep a copy of the proof in your files. r-z5 Page 13 Healthy Children in Safe Environments PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know Poisonous Household Substances:These common household substancesare poisonous.

Protect the children inyour care from exposure to lead. Followthe suggestions on the next page. 1111Healthy Children in Safe Environments 0PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know Lead poisoning is the number one envi-ronmental threat to the health of children inthe United States and is totally preventable.The damage that results from lead exposure canbe a very serious problem for young children.Large amounts of lead can cause serious damageto the brain, kidneys, nervous system, and redblood cells. Even small amounts of lead caninterfere with a child's learning and behavior.Although lead poisoning can be treated medi-cally, the treatment can not correct damage to thebrain or nervous system. Some damage is perma-nent.Children are most often exposed to leadby eating lead-based paint from reeling orflaking walls or window sills. While most paintssold since the mid 1970's are lead free, manyolder homes and public buildings still have layersof lead paint.Lead also gets into children's bodieswhen they put fingers, hands, and toys in theirmouths after playing in an area with leadcontaminated soil or dust. The soil becomescontaminated with iead from paint scrapings frombuildings or from car exhaust when leaded gaso-line was used.Lead was sometimes used in old pipesand plumbing. Water becomes contaminated asit travels through the pipes. Some food cans aremade using lead. In some cases the lead can seepinto the food. 9 0 Page 21 Healthy Children in Safe Environments Protect the children in your care from exposure to lead. Comply fully and promptly with all applicable state and local regulations regarding leadtesting and removal. Call your state or county health departments for more informafion.Have soil tested. Contact your nearest agricultural extension service for information.Never let a child dig in contaminated soil.Remove or cover contaminated soil (pave, sod, or add mulch, gravel, or new topsoil.)Plant bushes close to buildings to discourage play there.Plant gardens and establish play areas away from painted structures and busy roads.Install a fence or bushes as a barrier between busy streets and play areas or gardens.Provide a diet rich in iron and calcium and low in fats.Use the same measures recommended to control the spread of germs, like hand washingand washing surfaces, to help prevent lead dust buildup on hands and surfaces.Clean your own and children's hands frequently, especially before preparing food andeating. Also wash hands after touching pets, shoes, art supplies, and after gardening,crawling or playing in the dirt.Wet-mop floors, window wells, and window sills frequently (every 2 weeks or moreoften) with a high phosphate detergent such as TSP, Spic and Span, or Calgon.Provide clean teething toys to discourage chewing on railings, painted items, or paperproducts.Teach children to throw away any food that falls on the floor.Make sure children keep outdoor toys outside and indoor toys inside. Toys out of doorscollect more lead dust, which should not be brought inside.Use only cold water for drinking and making formula.Let cold water run for 5 minutes the first time the tap is used each day.Do not cook or heat food in its own can.Do not store food in an opened can.Sources: This information was adapted from Healthy Yonne Children: A Manual for Programs.Kendrick, Kaufmann, & Messenger Eds., NAEYC: 1988, p.209-210 and Resource Mothers Handbook,National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, 330 C St., SW, Switzer Building, Room 2014,Washington, D.C., 20201.(For more information call the National Lead Information Center at 1-800-LEAD-FYI or The Allianceto End Childhood lead Poisoning at 202-543-1147.)

In addition, poor oral healthmay contribute to poor eating habits, speechproblems, crooked teeth, damaged adult teeth,and yellow or brown adult teeth. The belief thatbaby teeth don't matter is wrong. Baby teeth domatter.Most of us are familiar with the connec-tion between sweets and cavities. This issue willbe explored in the nutrition section of this manual.We may not be so familiar with what is referredto as Baby Bottle Tooth Decay.Baby Bottle Tooth Decay results fromchildren going to bed with a bottle containingmilk or a sweet drink or carrying the bottle inhis or her mouth throughout the day. Almostany kind of drink except water can cause a baby 'steeth to decay. Prolonged expose to the drink isespecially harmful when a baby falls asleep witha bottle in his or her mouth.To protect children against baby bottle toothdecay:Use a bottle at meal times only. Be sure tohold the baby's bottle yourself.Put the baby to bed without a bottle, or fillthe bottle with water.Suggest to the parent(s) that they clean thebaby's teeth and gums each day with a cleanwashcloth or a small soft toothbrush.Suggest to the partnts that they ask theirdentist about fluoride for their child. Fluo-ride can help protect teeth from decay.Offer a child a cup as soon as he or she cansit up alone. By the time a baby is one yearold, he or she should not be using a bottle.Try these instead of a bottle at nap or bedtime:Offer a blanket, a soft toy, or clean pacifier.Don't dip the pacifier in anything sweet.Sing or play music.Hold or rock the baby.Rub the child's head or back.Put a toy or mobile that plays music near thebed.Read to the child or tell a story.This information on baby bottle tooth decay wastaken from a brochure ptoduced and distributedby:The Dental Health Foundation4286 Redwood Highway, #261San Rafael, Ca. 94903415-499-4648 992Page 23 Healthy Children in Safe Environments -.PRIMARY INFORMATIONWhat Every Family Child Care Provider Should Know All states have requirements about usingcar seats for infants and toddlers. Used correctly,car seats are 71% effective in preventing fatali-ties, 67% effective in reducing the need for hos-pitalization and 50% effective in preventing mi-nor injuries.Become familiar with your state's age require-ments for the use of car seats.When you use car seats, use them correctly.Read and follow the directions and make sureyou are using the right size (by weight) car seatfor each child.Make sure of the following:Infant is positioned correctly.For an infant up to 9 months or 20 pounds,the car seat must face the rear of the vehicle at a30-degree recline. The rear facing, reclined posi-tion allows the baby's back, rather than abdomenand chest, to absorb the force of impact in a crash.For a toddler, the car seat must face forward in anupright position.Harnesses is secured correctlyThe harness straps on the car seat ensurethat the child will remain in the seat during a crash.Harness straps should be snug no more then oneinch of slack - and should be secured over warmand not very bulky clothing for the best protec-tion. If a chest clip is provided, it should secure theshoulder harness straps together to minimize slip-page and should be positioned over the sternum(breastbone) area. Securing the shoulder harnessstraps together will also make it difficult for achild to wiggle out of the car seat.Seat belt is routed correctly and secured to thecar seat.To ensure that the car seat will remainin the proper position during a crash, a car seatmust be secured by a seat belt. The seat belt isoften routed differently on each car seat, even oncar seats that are made by the same company. Aseat belt that is routed incorrectly or not securedto the seat of the car may allow the car seat to comeapart or fly forward during a crash.Tether strap is usedIf a car seat is equipped with a tether strap,the tether strap must be used. A tether will give thecar seat the necessary stability to remain uprightin a crash.Caution: If you buy a used car seat, make sureit is safe. Read the special issue \"Is a Used CarSeat Safe?\" that follows. Page 25 Healthy Children in Safe Environments Special Issue: When Is a Used Car Seat Safe?

Parent's Pages 29s About the Parents' PagesTo the Provider:These pages are for you to copy and give to the parents of the children in yourcare. If possible, and not too much more expensive, copy them on coloredpaper. It makes them easier for parent.; to find and gives them an \"air\" ofimportance.The Parent's Pages perform 3 important functions.1. These handouts will inform parents. They contain important informa-tion that will benefit parents of young children.2. Sharing this information with parents will help you and parents worktGgether as a team to teach their children healthy eating habits.3. These handouts demonstrate your professionalism as a family child careprovider. They show parents your concern, knowledge, and skill in car-ing for their children.Make sure you do not give out your original copy of these pages.You will need them for the new families you recruit. This manual was made possible by an educational grant from Nestle USA, Inc. toSave The Children Child Care Support Center. Parents' Page:Eating Behaviors That Challenge Your PatienceHere are 4 common childhood eating behaviors that can leave parents frus-trated and bewildered and some suggestions for how you might respond to them.I. The messy eater.All children will be messy eaters until they develop the coordination and skillrequired to master eating behavior.What you can do: Don't expect too much from your child. Usually children are notgood at using a fork and spoon until around age three. And even after they beginto use utensils, expect them to put their hands in their food. This is a natural wayfor them to explore the world. Children also need to learn that some behaviors arenot appropriate at the table. However, children will not enjoy the meal if they areconstantly being criticized or corrected. There are 2 major ways to prevent childrenfrom misbehaving at the table. The first is to avoid attempts at making them eatfoods that they refuse to eat. In other words, do not provoke them by starting a foodfight. The second thing you can do is to keep your child focused on the task ofeating. Keep the atmosphere pleasant and relaxed and engage in quiet conversa-tion about the different foods you have served or the day's events.2. The picky eater.While you need to respect children's likes and dislikes, you also need to recognizethat their food preferences are still developing. Many children will automaticallydislike a new food. This does not mean they will never like the food, or that youshould stop serving it.What you can do: Try preparing the food item differently. Wait a week or so andtry it again. Never try to force or bribe a child into trying a food. This just leaves thechild with a bad association with the food. Model good eating behavior yourself byeating the food and allow the child to leave the food they don't want on their plate.Warning: This will be harder than you think.3. The child who goes on a food jag.Many children go on food jags where they demand the same foods over and over.What you can do: Stay cahn and treat the demand casually. As long as the foodthe child is demanding is not empty calories- (high in sugar with little nutritionalvalue) be patient until the food jag passes. He/she will soon grow out of it.4. The child who develops food rituals.Some children develop food rituals, like always wanting to wear a certain bib, usea certain cup, or have their sandwich cut in a particular way.What y ou can do: Be patient. Your child is being exposed to a world of new things.Food rituals can help them feel more secure. Let them have their ritual until theydecide to give them up. '100 ,.arents' Page: Introducing New FoodsWhatever you do, never force or bribe a child to try a new food. Evenif you win that battle, you can bet that the next time the food is offered, yourchild will remember being forced or bribed to eat it, and will dislike the foodeven more.Be patient when introducing new foods. Many children must beoffered a food 8 to 10 times before they decide to try it and discover they likeit. Here are some things that you can do to help your child accept newfoods:Introduce only one new food at a time. Find out what new foodyour provider is introducing and work together.Serve the new food with familiar foods.Serve only small amounts of the new food.Introduce a new food only when your child is hungry.Talk about the new food- its taste, its color, its texture, how itgrows, etc.Let your child see you eating it and enjoying it.Encourage the child to taste the new food. If he or she rejectsit, accept the refusal and try again in a week or so.Find out what is not liked about the new food. It may besomething you can change, like the way the food is prepared.Sometimes a child will refuse a food prepared one way, but likeit prepared another way. In spite of the frustration you may sometimes feel, it is important thatyou continue to offer newfoods, even when your child rejects them. If youdo not, your child may not have the variety in his or her diet needed for propergrowth and development. In addition, your child will be robbed of theopportunity to experience new tastes and textures and to add new favoritesto his or her diet. 1 0 1 Parents' Page:The Most Common Nutritional Problemsfor ChildrenThe biggest dietary concerns for children in the U.S.are iron deficiency anemia and not getting enough of vitamins A and C.Iron Deficiency AnemiaChildren who are suffering from iron deficiency are often pale, listless, andirritable. They may have little energy or appetite and frequent colds. Iron deficiencyanemia results from either the failure to eat enough iron rich foods or the failureof the body to absorb thc iron. Make sure your child gets enough iron by servingplenty of iron rich foods like red meats, fish, green leafy vegetables like spinachand mustard greens, raisins and prunes, iron-rich breads, and dry beans anddry peas. To help the body absorb the iron, serve iron rich foods with foodscontaining vitamin C, like orange juice or tomatoes. Do not serve children foodsand beverages that contain caffeine. Caffeine interferes with the body's absorptionof iron.Vitamin A and Vitamin CVitamins A and C are the two vitamins most lacking in American children'sdiets. Neither of these vitamins are stored by the body. This means that the body'ssupply must be replenished regularly. Offer your child foods that are a goodsource of vitamin C every day. Offer them foods that are a good source ofvitamin A at least every other day.Some Good Sources of Vitamin C SomeBroccoliBrussels sproutscabbageCauliflowerCollardsKaleOkraPeppers (sweet, hot, and chili)Snow peasTomatoesCantaloupeGrapefruitKiwi fruitLemonMangoOrangesPapayaStrawberriesFruit juices vitamin CGood Easy BeNutritious?Yes. Here are a few hints.Fresh Vegetables: Some parents say that the problems they have with offering lots offresh vegetables are the time and effort it takes to wash them, peel them and cut them,and the risk that they will spoil before they are eaten. If these are your complaints, tryfrozen vegetables. They can be just as nutritious, and sornetimes even more nutritiousthan fresh. And most frozen vegetables cook well and even retain more nutrients whencooked in the microwave. Avoid the vegetables packaged with sauces and gravies.Packaged Convenience Foods: A big problem with many packaged foods likemacaroni and cheese, seasoned rice and pasta dishes, bread stuffing, and scalloped andau gratin potatoes is thatthey can be high in fat and sodium. Choose lowfat, low sodiumversions of these products when they are available. If they are not available, try thesesuggestion to lower the fat and sodium.Do not add additional salt, even when the directions call for it.When the directions call for whole milk, use lowfat milk instead.Reduce the amount of margarine called for in the recipe byFast Foods: Almost all of us have occasions when fast food meals are called for. And fastfoods do provide some of the essential vitamins and minerals we need. However, there are2 major drawbacks to eating fast foods. First, few fast food restaurants offer many foodchoices that are rich in calcium, fiber and vitamins A and C. Second:fast food meals areusually high in calories, fat and sodium relative to the amount of nutrients they provide.Use the following tips to help you to make better choices when eating at fast foodrestaurants.The Main Selection: Choose regular sandwiches rather than doubles, and plain typesrather than those with lots of extras like cheese, bacon, and \"special\" sauces. Orderroast beef for a leaner option than most burgers. Breaded, deep-fat-fried fish andchicken sandwiches (especially with cheese or tartar sauce) have more fat and caloriesthan a plain burger. When \"fbzing\" your sandwich, load up on lettuce, tomato, andonion, and go easy on pickles, mustard, catsup, and other sauces. Ifyou're having friedchicken, remove some or all of the breading before eating.On the Side: Skip the fries if you are ordering a sandwich that is deep-fat fried or madewith sauce or cheese. Order a small rather than a large portion, specify no salt, andadd just a small amount yourself. Or choose a plain baked potato, mashed potatoes,or a salad instead offries. Go easy on toppings like butter, sour cream and saladdressings and on creamy salads like potato salad. coleslaw and macaroni salad. Selectcut vegetables and lowfat dressing to use for dip from the salad bar and let the familyshare. When ordering chicken, have a dinner roll instead of a biscuit.Beverages: Choose lowfat or skim milk or ask for water.A final tip: Don't make fastfoods a habit. Instead, make your ownconvenience foods. Plan ahead. When you cook, cook extra. Freeze itin small containers so that it is available for quick, easy,nutritiousmeals. 4 03 Parents Page: The DietaryGuidelinesHealthy eating habits are learned in childhood. Help me to teach yourchild healthy eating habits by following these dietary guidelines establishedby the United States Department of Agriculture and the United StatesDepartment of Health and Human Services.1. Eat a variety of foods.Variety means not only selecting foods from each of the five major foodgroups, but also variety in selection within the food groups. These 5food groups are:1. fruits2. vegetables3. breads, cereal, pastas and other foods made from grains4. milk, yogurt and cheese5. thy beans and dry peas, eggs, fish, poultry, and fish. Tt order to get all of the nutrients our bodies need, we need variety inthe food we eat over a several day period.2. Maintain a Healthy Weight.Some parents worry that their children are too heavy or too thin andthey try to control the amount their child eats. Usually children arethe best judge of how much food they should eat. They know whenthey are full. However, if you feel your child is underweight, offer moresnacks throughout the day. Children can not eat too much food at onetime so these regular snacks are very important. If you have a childwho is overweight, it may be that they do not get enough exercise. Tryturning off the t.v. Encourage your child to play outside and get moreexercise. Find an activity in which the whole family can participate. Ifyou believe your child's weight problem is serious, see your health careprovider. Never try to force feed your child, and never restrict yourchild's diet unless directed to do so by a health professional.3. Avoid too much fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.Children under two have a greater need for fat. Serve them whole milkand do not limit their fat intake. After age two, limit your child's fatintake along with that of the rest of your family. Use smaller amountsof fats and oils including salad dressings, mayonnaise, butter.margarine. Choose liquid vegetable oils instead of solid oils andtropical oils like palm oil and coconut oil. Serve lowfat or skim milkinstead of whole milk, select leaner cuts of meat, serve fewer eggs andoccasionally substitute dry beans and peas for meat. But remember,children burn lots of calories. By limiting fat, you are limiting a majorsource of calories in their diet. Make up for it by offering them morefruits, vegetables, and breads, grains and pastas. 4'14 4. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables so that you get adequate starchand fiber.Children are not known for their love of fruits and vegetables, but thismay be due in part to our failure to give then many chances to likethese foods. There is a great variety of fruits and vegetables to choosefrom. If your child doesn't like one, perhaps they will like another. Ifthey don't like a vegetable cooked one way, they may like it cookedanother way or even served raw with a dip. Many children prefer theirvegetables lightly streamed so that they are still brightly colored anda little bit crisp. Never force or bribe your child into eating their fruitsand vegetables, but don't give up either. Just keep offering them.5. Avoid too much sugar.There are three major problems with sugar. First, many foods high insugar are not very nutritious. For a child who has a high need fornutrients, and a small stomach, filling up on sugary foods is a missedopportunity to get vitamins and minerals they need for proper growthand development. Second, the more frequently children eat foodscontaining sugar the greater their risk for tooth decay-especially ifsweet foods are eaten between meals, and especially if the foods stickto their teeth, like raisins and jelly beans.
