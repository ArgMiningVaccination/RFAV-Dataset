No prescription required. COVID-19 vaccinations The US Food and Drug Administration recently moved to simplify the COVID-19 vaccination schedules for most people. As part of these changes, the current bivalent vaccines (original and omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains) are now used for all doses for anyone 6 months of age and older, including for an additional dose or doses for certain populations. The original monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are no longer authorized for use in the United States. If you have been fully vaccinated and previously received required boosters, you do not need an additional booster at this time. Vaccinations following these new guidelines are available at multiple UK Retail Pharmacy locations as well as the UK Pharmacist Care Clinic at 245 Fountain Court, Room 220. Fountain Court is located just off Man O'War near Richmond Road. Vaccinations for children under 18 are given only at the Fountain Court location, and all minors must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. Flu shots may be received at the same time as the COVID vaccine; just let your pharmacist know.
