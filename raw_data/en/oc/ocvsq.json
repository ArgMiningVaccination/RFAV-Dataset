Our team and other epilepsy experts believe that these vaccines are safe for individuals with epilepsy, TSC, and other neurological conditions associated with epilepsy. No study to date has assessed the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with epilepsy or TSC. However, having epilepsy does not increase one's risk of contracting COVID-19. There are several medical conditions identified by the CDC that may put an individual at higher risk of contracting a severe COVID-19 infection. A severe COVID-19 infection can result in hospitalization and possible death. The CDC does not recognize epilepsy or TSC as one of those medical conditions. However, [according to the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance](https://www.tscalliance.org/), comorbidities, such as lung and kidney disease, that can be associated with TSC, may put an individual at higher risk for contracting a severe case COVID-19. Our team recommends getting the vaccine to prevent severe infection and hospitalization. If you have any questions or concerns please consult your primary care physician. Stay Safe! Frequently Asked Questions Will the vaccine increase my seizures? There have been no trials to date that have studied the effects of the COVID-19 vaccine on patients with epilepsy. Additionally, it is important to note that an elevated temperature (fever) is one of the potential side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines. If you experience seizures that are triggered by a fever you should consult a medical professional. However, [The Epilepsy Foundation suggests](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/covid-19-and-epilepsy/covid-19-vaccination) that \"the data on the risks of COVID and safety of the COVID vaccines still support vaccination.\" When and where can I get the vaccine? Safe, effective and free COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available. Speak with your primary care doctor or visit the [Mass General Brigham vaccine information page](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/covid19/vaccine/) to learn more. Can I contract COVID-19 from the vaccine? No, the vaccines do not contain the live virus. They teach the body how to recognize the SARS-CoV2 virus in our bodies and create an immune response. Can my child get vaccinated? Speak with your primary care doctor or visit the [Mass General Brigham vaccine information page](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/covid19/vaccine/) to check vaccine availability for children.
