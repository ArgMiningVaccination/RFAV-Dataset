ACTION: Removal of rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission is repealing its rule providing an employee exemption from application of the financial conflict of interest prohibition at 18 U.S.C. 208(a). The removal of this rule is in response to publication by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) of a superseding, executive branch-wide rule that describes the circumstances under which the prohibitions contained in 18 U.S.C. 208(a) would be waived. EFFECTIVE DATE : April 17, 1997. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Norman M. Gleichman, General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, 1730 K Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20006; telephone: 202\u00b1 653\u00b15610 (202\u00b1566\u00b12673 for TDD Relay). These are not toll-free numbers. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : I. Background Under the Commission's rule, codified at 29 CFR 2703.3, an employee's ownership of shares of stock, bonds, or other corporate securities and shares in a mutual fund, regulated fund, or regulated investment company was exempted from application of the financial conflict of interest prohibition at 18 U.S.C. 208(a) if the aggregate fair market value of such holdings did not exceed $5,000 in a single enterprise. On December 18, 1996, OGE published a final rule entitled ``Interpretation, Exemptions and Waiver Guidance Concerning 18 U.S.C. 208 (Acts Affecting a PersonalFinancial Interest),'' which superseded the Commission's rule. See 61 FR 66830\u00b166851, Dec. 18, 1996, as corrected at 62 FR 1361, Jan. 9, 1997. OGE's new rule, codified at 5 CFR Part 2640 and made effective January 17, 1997, describes the circumstances under which the prohibitions contained in 18 U.S.C. 208(a) would be waived. The removal of 29 CFR 2703.3 does not affect the Commission's prohibited financial interests rule, codified at 5 CFR 8401.102. See 61 FR 39869\u00b139870, July 31, 1996. II. Matters of Regulatory Procedure The Commission has determined that the removal of 29 CFR 2703.3 is not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. The Commission has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601\u00b1612) that the removal of 29 CFR 2703.3 would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Statement and Analysis has not been prepared. The Commission has determined that the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) does not apply because the removal of 29 CFR 2703.3 does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget. List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 2703 Conflict of interests, Government employees. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission is amending title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: PART 2703\u00d0[AMENDED] 1.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress is adopting final regulations recognizing that satellite master antenna television (SMATV) systems are eligible as cable systems under section 111 of the Copyright Act to obtain a compulsory license to retransmit broadcast signals to their subscribers. The regulations provide guidance as to who should file and how to report distant signals. EFFECTIVE DATE : July 1, 1997. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Nanette Petruzzelli, Acting General Counsel, or Tanya Sandros, Attorney Advisor, Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540, (202\u00b1707\u00b18380) or Telefax (202\u00b1707\u00b1 8366). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Background Section 111 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C., establishes a mechanism by which cable systems may obtain a compulsory license to make secondary transmissions to their subscribers of copyrighted works performed on broadcast stations. A compulsory license is attractive to users of copyrighted material because it gives them guaranteed access to and a guaranteed price for copyrighted works, and avoids the costs of negotiating with each individual copyright owner. As a result, many providers of broadcast signals have sought to qualify as cable systems under section 111, so that they may obtain a cable compulsory license. Consequently, on October 15, 1986, the Copyright Office published a Notice of Inquiry inviting public comment on whether satellite master antenna television systems (SMATV), multichannel multipoint distribution18706 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations 1On January 29, 1992, the Office concluded its inquiry into the definition of a ``cable system'' in Docket No. 86\u00b17B and issued a regulation denying both ``wireless'' cable operators and satellite carriers eligibility for the cable compulsory license. 57 FR 3284 (January 29, 1992). Subsequent to the issuance of this regulation, Congress passed the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994, Public Law 103\u00b1369, which amended the definition of a ``cable system'' in section 111 to include ``wireless'' cable systems, such as the multichannel multipoint distribution systems.systems (MMDS),1or satellite carriers1 qualify as cable systems under section 111 of the Copyright Act. 51 FR 36705 (Oct. 15, 1986). As part of the inquiry, the Office solicited specific comments on how an individual SMATV operation qualifying as a cable system would file statements of account, and on who would be deemed the owner of a SMATV system. The inquiry concerning SMATV systems was based on the following understanding of how a SMATV operates: SMATV systems use TVROs [television receive-only satellite dish] to receive transmissions via satellite, and a master antenna for receipt of over the air television signals. The programming is then combined and distributed by cable to subscribers, primarily in apartment houses and other multi-unit residential buildings. 51 FR 36706 (1986). After analysis of the comments to the Notice of Inquiry, the Copyright Office concluded that SMATV systems could qualify as cable systems and issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing regulations by which SMATV systems could obtain a compulsory license to retransmit broadcast signals. 56 FR 31580 (July 11, 1991). At that time, the Office also acknowledged its practice of accepting filings from SMATV operators, without ruling on their sufficiency or adequacy, during the period that the Office considers whether such filings are appropriate. 56 FR 31596 (1991). The Office further advised those SMATV operators, who had previously filed Statements of Account during prior accounting periods without guidance or knowledge of the new rules, that they need not amend these filings. This understanding, however, does not preclude any facility from amending its prior filings under the new regulations, after they are issued in final form. Comments Responding to the proposed regulations on the eligibility of SMATV systems for the cable compulsory license, the Office received direct comments from: \u00d0Liberty Cable Company, Inc. (Liberty), a SMATV system operator in the New York City area. \u00d0MaxTel Cablevision, a SMATV system owner and operator, Western CableCommunications, Inc., a SMATV system owner and operator, and National Private Cable Association, an association of SMATV systems operators, equipment manufacturers, vendors, and program distributors, jointly (MaxTel et. al.); \u00d0Mid-Atlantic Cable, Stellar Communications, Inc., TeleCom Satellite Systems Corp., Telesat Cablevision, Inc., 21st Century Technology Group, Inc., all SMATV system operators, and National Satellite Programming Network, Inc., a provider of programming and support services to SMATV systems operators, jointly (Mid-Atlantic et. al.); \u00d0the Motion Picture Association of America, Inc. (MPAA), a trade association that represents copyright owner-claimants for section 111 royalties; \u00d0the National Cable Television Association (NCTA), a cable television trade association; \u00d0National CableSystems Associates, (NCSA) owner and operator of 25 SMATV systems in the Atlanta, Georgia area; \u00d0Pepper & Corazzini, a law firm representing independently owned and cable-affiliated SMATV systems; \u00d0Satellite Television of New York Associates, d/b/a Community Home Entertainment, (Community), the SMATV operator of Co-Op City, Bronx, New York; \u00d0Spectradyne, Inc. (Spectradyne), provider of free-to-guest satellite video programming to hotels; and \u00d0Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (TBS), licensee of superstation WTBS, Atlanta, Georgia. The Office also received reply comments from: \u00d0MaxTel, et. al.; \u00d0MPAA; \u00d0Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League (the Professional Sports Leagues); and \u00d0NCTA. Eligibility for the Section 111 Compulsory License The following commentators agree with the Copyright Office's conclusion that SMATV systems qualify as cable systems for section 111 purposes: Community, Liberty, Maxtel et. al., Mid- Atlantic et. al., MPAA, NCSA, Pepper & Corazzini, Spectradyne, and TBS. NCTA takes no position on the question of SMATV eligibility. The Professional Sports Leagues oppose the eligibility of SMATV systems as cable systems because theyargue that Congress intended to draw a distinction between traditional cable and other retransmission media, such as MATV systems (the predecessor systems to SMATVs, similar in all respects to SMATV systems except without the capacity to receive satellite transmissions) when they exempted MATV systems from copyright liability in section 111, so long as they retransmitted only local signals to their subscribers. Professional Sports Leagues, reply comments at 7\u00b18. Thus, having afforded MATV systems such an exemption, the Professional Sports Leagues argue that the remainder of section 111 is intended to apply to traditional cable systems. The Professional Sports Leagues also argue that the section 111 compulsory license was based on economic necessity, and that in 1976, traditional cable systems could not exist without the compulsory license, but such economic necessity was not true of MATV systems then, or SMATV systems now. Reply comments at 8. This argument was raised in the previous round of comments and responded to by the Office in the 1991 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking where the Office said that the section 111(a)(1) exemption was intended merely to ensure that residents of multiple unit dwellings had access to local television signals. 56 FR 31595 (July 11, 1991). The section 111(a)(1) exemption does not prohibit a master antenna television system from importing distant signals nor does it address the consequences of importing distant signals. The Office considered that such a system would have copyright liability. Whether it must meet that liability through negotiation with the copyright owners or could meet it by obtaining a compulsory license is the issue, and the fact that Congress gave MATV systems an exemption for local retransmissions does not affect the analysis. Nor does the Office agree that the analysis should depend on whether SMATV systems would still be economically viable without the compulsory license. As the Professional Sports Leagues themselves point out, many cable systems today would be economically viable without the compulsory license, but nothing in section 111 would render a cable system ineligible because it was economically sound. The viability of a provider of broadcast signals with or without the compulsory license is not the question; the question is whether Congress intended the providers to be included in section 111. TBS agrees that SMATV systems qualify as cable systems, but disagrees18707 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations with certain aspects of the Copyright Office's analysis. It argues that the Office should not look to whether a particular video provider constitutes a ``local medium of limited availability,'' or to whether the FCC has affirmatively approved retransmissions by a particular type of facility, but should confine itself to addressing whether a SMATV system ``retransmits broadcast signals to paying subscribers by wires, cables, or other communications channels.'' TBS, comments at 13\u00b114. In other words, TBS argues that the Copyright Office should only look at the section 111 definition of a cable system. However, as the Office has stated previously, section 111 must be construed in accordance with Congressional intent and as a whole, not just in reference to one particular section. 57 FR 3292 (Jan. 29, 1992). The Office notes that at the time Congress created the cable compulsory license, the FCC regulated the cable industry as a highly localized medium of limited availability, suggesting that Congress, cognizant of the FCC's regulations and the market realities, fashioned a compulsory license with a local rather than a national scope. This being so, the Office retains the position that a provider of broadcast signals be an inherently localized transmission media of limited availability to qualify as a cable system. 56 FR 31595 (July 11, 1991). It is therefore the Office's conclusion, after considering the above comments, that SMATV systems are cable systems for purposes of section 111. Identifying a SMATV System While the Copyright Office has discussed the eligibility of SMATV systems for the cable compulsory license and described how a SMATV system operates in its initial Notice of Inquiry, the Office has chosen not to define a SMATV system in its regulations, although SMATV systems present unique compulsory license reporting issues which require clarification in the Copyright Office's rules. None of the commentators raised the issue, suggesting that the nature and operation of a SMATV system is generally understood within the industry. We note, too, that the Federal Communications Commission, while regulating SMATV systems in various ways, has never defined a SMATV system in its regulations. Yet, all parties must operate with a common understanding as to what is a SMATV system. To this end, the Office believes an examination of the FCC regulatory policy toward SMATV systems is usefulfor determining the characteristics of a SMATV system. Since 1966, the FCC's definition of a cable system excluded those systems serving multiple unit dwellings. See, Second Report and Order on CATV Regulation, 2 FCC 2d 725 (1966). These excluded systems were apparently originally MATVs (Master Antenna Television Systems), but were later thought to include SMATVs. In the 1984 Cable Act, Congress specifically excluded from the definition of a ``cable system'' ``a facility that serves only subscribers in 1 or more multiple unit dwellings under common ownership, control, or management, unless such facility or facilities uses any public right-of-way * **.'' 47 U.S.C. 522(7) (1984). The House Report to the Cable Act described the exemption as applying to ``a facility or combination of facilities that serves only subscribers in one or more multiple unit dwellings (in other words, a satellite master antenna television system), unless such facility or facilities use a public right-of-way.'' H.R. Rep. No. 934, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 44 (1984). Congress modified the section 522(7) exemption in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The section now exempts from the definition of a cable system ``a facility that serves subscribers without using any public right-of-way.'' 47 U.S.C. 522(7) (1996). The new exemption certainly continues to include SMATV systems, but has been broadened to include other types of retransmission facilities such as wireless cable. While the Office believes that the history of communications regulation of SMATV systems is relevant to determining what is a SMATV system, we acknowledge that it is not dispositive for the copyright inquiry. We do not believe that the FCC requirement of not crossing a public right-of-way is important for section 111 purposes because the distinction only determines whether such a facility will be regulated as a cable system for FCC purposes, as opposed to defining what a SMATV system is or does. Consequently, we are identifying as SMATV systems only those facilities which receive television signals from satellites and retransmit them to subscribers residing in multiple unit dwellings, such as apartment complexes and hotels. Party Responsible for Filing the Statement of Account and Remitting Royalties In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Office proposed that the party responsible for filing thestatement of account and remitting royalties on behalf of a SMATV system should be the building owner where the SMATV system is operating, not the entity that provides the signals and maintains the facility. This was proposed for two reasons. First, it was observed that satellite carriers are often the signal providers for a building, and to allow a satellite carrier to designate itself as the owner of the cable system could qualify a satellite carrier as a cable system, a result contrary to the Office's conclusion that satellite carriers are not cable systems. Second, designating the distributors of the broadcast signals as the filer might result in lower reported gross receipts, because the distributor would report the rate it charged the building, but not any add-ons, if there were any, that the building owner might charge the residents or guests. 1. Concerns About Requiring Building Owners To File The Office's question about who should be the filer elicited the greatest amount of discussion from the commentators. Uniformly, the comments state that the filer should not necessarily be the building owner. The commentators' greatest concern is that if the responsibility to file is placed on the building owner, many building owners will be inclined to avoid the responsibility by either replacing the SMATV system with a traditional cable system or ceasing to provide video programming altogether. These concerns were addressed in the comments. See Spectradyne, comments at 3\u00b14; NCSA, comments at 6\u00b17; Mid-Atlantic et. al., comments at 4; and Community, comments at 3\u00b14. 2. Comments Addressing Copyright Office's Concerns Many of the commentators who believe the system operator, not the building owner, should be the filer, sought to allay the Office's concerns about satellite carrier eligibility and the potential for underreporting gross receipts. As to whether satellite carriers that distribute signals to SMATV systems would qualify as cable systems, Pepper and Corazzini assert, The satellite carrier would never be in a position to designate itself as the cable system. Where the owner of a hotel or multi- unit dwelling provides the service itself, it purchases the signals from the satellite carrier or the carrier's distributor. The satellite carrier does not exercise any control or management responsibility over the SMATV system, nor does the carrier have18708 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations any contractual privity with the subscribers. This is true whether the SMATV service is provided by the hotel or an owner of a multi- unit dwelling or by an [sic] SMATV operator. Pepper & Corazzini, comments at 5. Similarly, Maxtel et. al. states, It is not the satellite carrier who is the signal distributor to the customers of the SMATV operator any more than that satellite carrier is the signal distributor to the customers of the traditional franchised cable television operator. The satellite carrier merely distributes signals to the headend facility of either the SMATV operator or the cable franchisee * * * Contrary to the direct transmission between a satellite carrier and an individual single family home TVRO [television receive-only satellite dish], there is always an intermediary retransmitter between the satellite carrier and the subscriber residing within an apartment complex, for example. Thus, the satellite carrier would never be designated as the owner of the cable system for filing purposes and the Copyright Office need not be concerned over any anomaly with its determination that ``satellite carriers do not and cannot qualify for the cable compulsory license.'' MaxTel et. al., comments at 5. Spectradyne addresses the possibility, disputed by Pepper & Corazzini and MaxTel et. al., that a satellite carrier could both deliver the distant signal and be the SMATV system operator. It argues that the Copyright Office's concerns can be met in the case of a satellite carrier which happens also to be a SMATV operator, because ``the [compulsory] license would apply only to the SMATV element of the satellite carrier's business. In order to be free from copyright infringement liability for the remaining portions of its operation (ground to transponder to ground) the satellite carrier would either have to qualify as a passive carrier or negotiate copyright licenses. There is no anomaly in this.'' Spectradyne, comments at 5. The commentators also believe that the potential for underreporting the gross receipts can be avoided. Spectradyne states that ``any fear of revenue under-reporting can be relieved by imposing on system operators the obligation to report not only amounts received by them but the higher of the amounts they receive and any amounts collected by the hotel operator from guests for the privilege of viewing the tier of service at issue.'' Spectradyne, comments at 6\u00b17. MaxTel et. al. posits three possible situations concerning bulk rates that may or may not reflect the total gross receipts. First, most SMATV operators contracting with private property owners do not provide such service on a bulk rate basis, but rather charge individual subscribers directly for theservice. Second, most property owners desiring a bulk rate contract do so to increase occupancy, and thus do not even charge a premium for the cable service. Third, traditional franchised cable television operators also enter into bulk rate contracts with private property owners, in which the owner can charge the residents a higher fee than the property owner paid the cable franchisee for the service. Yet the Copyright Office has not found the cable system owner in that circumstance to be the property owner as opposed to the cable franchisee * * * If the Copyright Office wishes to rectify the fact that the gross receipts figure will necessarily not include any additional charges rendered by a property owner authorizing service under a bulk rate contract, then the Copyright Office should adopt regulations applicable to both SMATV operators and cable franchisees. MaxTel et. al., comments at 7. Mid-Atlantic et. al. argues that the definition of the SMATV system operator can be made flexible enough so that if there is no additional charge by the building owner, the business operating the SMATV system is the SMATV system operator, but if there is an additional charge by the building owner, as reflected in subscription agreements with the individual subscribers in the building, then the building owner would be the one designated in that instance as the SMATV system operator. Mid-Atlantic et. al., comments at 5. 3. Commentators' Recommended Definition of Filer Community recommends that the filer be ``the entity that provides the service to the actual subscriber or to the tenant or unit owner.'' Community, comments at 4. Liberty recommends a definition of the filer that would allow either the building owner or the SMATV system operator to make the filings and the payments, according to whichever arrangement made sense to the SMATV system operator and building operator, provided that the building operator could designate an agent to sign the Statement of Account. Liberty, comments at 1\u00b12. Similarly, Spectradyne recommends ``permitting either the building owner or the system operator to file the statement of account.'' Spectradyne, comments at 4. Mid-Atlantic et. al. recommends that the filer should be the operator of the SMATV system, whether that is the building owner or a third party who has a contract with the building owner to provide the service. Mid-Atlantic et. al., comments at 2. MaxTel et. al. recommends that the filer should be ``the owner of the headend facility and the recipient of the subscriber revenues.'' MaxTel et. al.,comments at 9. MPAA supported this recommendation. MPAA, reply comments at 16. Similarly, NCSA recommends defining the filer as ``that party who both provides the cable TV service to the ultimate subscriber or television viewer and also receives payment from said subscriber or television viewer for the service either directly or indirectly through a third party.'' NCSA, comments at 11. Likewise, Pepper & Corazzini recommends that the filer be ``the entity that is in charge of the operation of the system and the collection of subscriber revenues.'' Pepper and Corazzini, comments at 8. 4. Discussion The Office appreciates the concern expressed by SMATV system operators that if the building owner is required to be the filer, some building owners might refuse to take on that responsibility, to the detriment of the SMATV system operator. Therefore, the Office agrees that the building owner who is uninvolved with the SMATV system operation may not, in that circumstance, be the best one to file the statement of account. In searching for the best solution, the Office is inclined to agree with NCSA, that the filer should be the party that provides the retransmission service and receives the payment, either through a bulk rate charged to the building owner, or by individually billing the subscriber, or by any other billing arrangement. The Office also appreciates the distinction drawn by Spectradyne between a satellite carrier acting in its capacity as a SMATV system operator and a satellite carrier acting in its capacity as the deliverer of the distant signal. The Office agrees that the satellite carrier could also be the SMATV system operator for that portion of the satellite carrier's operation for which it performs the functions of a SMATV system operator, but not for the direct delivery of the distant signals. Similarly, a building owner could also be a SMATV system operator, if the building owner is the one that provides the retransmission service and collects the payments from the subscribers. Furthermore, the Office acknowledges the points raised by MaxTel et al. about bulk rates and the importance of ensuring that any rules adopted for SMATV system are consistent with the Office's policy toward traditional cable systems. Therefore, the gross receipts that shall be reported shall be those collected by the filer, either directly from the subscribers or indirectly through a third party.18709 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations In no case shall gross receipts for the SMATV facility be less than the cost of obtaining the signals of primary broadcast transmitters for subsequent retransmission by the SMATV facility. As a result, if the building owner is the SMATV system operator because he or she provides the retransmission service, but does not charge his or her residents, tenants, or guests, because it is a ``free'' service, the building owner, nonetheless, reports as gross receipts the amount that he or she pays the satellite carrier for the cost of bringing in the broadcast signals. Calculation of Royalties for Form 3 SMATV Systems In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Office stated that SMATV systems that file as Form 3 systems\u00d0those grossing $292,000 or more per semiannual accounting period\u00d0would be required to comply with the signal carriage and market quota regulations applied by the FCC to cable systems when making their royalty calculations, even though SMATV systems that did not use the public rights-of-way were not, in fact, subject to such regulations. This proposal is supported by MPAA and NCTA, who each argued that if SMATV systems are to qualify as cable systems, they should be treated the same way as traditional cable systems. MPAA, reply comments at 16\u00b117; NCTA, comments at 2. This proposal is opposed by Community. Community argues that the Copyright Office is bound to follow the law, and that, under FCC rules, SMATV systems not using the public rights-of- way were not subject to distant signal quotas. Therefore, the Copyright Office may not impose 3.75% rate charges for signals that SMATV systems were permitted to import before 1981. Furthermore, Community states that it received an opinion letter from the General Counsel of the Copyright Office in 1984 confirming Community's interpretation of the law. Community, comments at 2\u00b13, Attachment C. In reply, NCTA argues that the Copyright Office is not so restrained as Community asserts, and that the Office may make common sense responses to problems that arise during the implementation of section 111, so long as those responses are not inconsistent with congressional intent. NCTA believes it is logical for the Office to conclude that since Congress intended new technologies to be eligible for the cable license, it did not intend to treat these new technologies more favorably than traditional cable systems. Finally, NCTA notes that the Copyright Officerequires newly constructed cable systems to pay 3.75% rate royalties even though they were never subject to the FCC's distant signal rules. NCTA, reply comments at 1\u00b13. The Office's main goal in administering section 111 is to implement Congress' intent. Congress recently addressed the issue of how to apply the definition of a cable system to new technologies when it amended section 111(f) to include multichannel multipoint distribution service systems, otherwise known as MMDS or ``wireless cable,'' as cable systems. Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994, Public Law 103\u00b1 369, 108 Stat. 3477. Congressional intent is manifest in both the Senate and House reports. The Senate report stated: The committee intends ``wireless'' cable and traditional wired cable systems to be placed on equal footing with respect to their royalty obligations under the cable compulsory license, so that one not have an unfair advantage over the other due to differences in their regulatory status under FCC rules. The committee expects the Copyright Office, in applying section 111 to ``wireless'' cable systems, should treat ``wireless'' cable systems as if they were subject to the same FCC rules and regulations that are applicable to wired cable systems. Sen. Rep. 407, 103d Cong., 2nd Sess., at 14 (1994). Similarly, the House Report stated, Because the purpose of this legislation is to place wired and wireless cable systems on a level playing field, in calculating the fees payable by wireless systems, reference should be made to the same FCC rules that would be applicable if the system were wired, e.g., the distant signal quota rules for purposes of determining whether the 3.75% of gross receipts rate is applicable. H. R. Rep. 703, 103d Cong., 2nd Sess., at 19 (1994). Any reliance that Community believes should be placed on the 1984 opinion letter from the Office's General Counsel is now clearly superseded by this expression of Congress' intent. Therefore, the Office will require Form 3 SMATV systems to calculate their distant signal royalties on the same basis as traditional cable systems. Commonly Owned or Controlled SMATV Systems in Contiguous Communities and SMATV Systems Operating From the Same Headend Section 111(f) states that for purposes of determining the royalty fee, two or more cable systems in contiguous communities under common ownership or control, or operating from one headend, shall be considered as one system. In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Office stated that it hadreceived a request from NCTA to address its petition to reinterpret section 111(f) to provide that two or more cable systems would have to be in contiguous communities under common ownership and control and operating from one headend before they would be required to file as one individual cable system. The Office responded to NCTA's petition by stating that the issue was being addressed in another rulemaking proceeding and would not be examined here. 56 FR 31596 (July 11, 1991). However, several commentators submitted comments on a related issue asking what constitutes ``contiguous communities'' in the context of SMATV systems. Pepper & Corazzini argues that because most SMATV systems do not use the public rights-of-way, by their very nature, they are stand alone operations and are not contiguous with each other, even when they are in the same community. Pepper & Corazzini believe they should be considered contiguous only when they are physically on adjoining properties or are interconnected by wire or radio. Pepper & Corazzini, comments at 7. These comments are supported by MaxTel et al. MaxTel, reply comments at 3\u00b14. MPAA and NCTA disagree with Pepper & Corazzini and MaxTel et al. They both argue that SMATV systems should be treated the same way as cable systems and that the same interpretation of contiguous communities should apply. NCTA proposes that the Office should require commonly owned or controlled SMATV systems to be considered a single cable system when they are located in the same or contiguous communities, or when they operate from the same headend. NCTA, comments at 2\u00b13. MPAA supports NCTA's proposal. MPAA, reply comments at 16. The Copyright Office agrees with MPAA and NCTA that Congress' intent is to treat new technologies on the same basis as traditional cable systems. It would be inequitable if a SMATV system operator, serving several buildings within a community, were considered to be operating separate cable systems, while a cable operator in that same community serving several non-adjoining households is considered a single system. Therefore, the Office concludes that a SMATV system operator is a single cable system when it serves multiple unit dwellings in the same community or in contiguous communities, using political boundaries to determine when communities are contiguous.18710 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations 1EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216). 2The San Francisco Bay Area was designated as a moderate nonattainment area for ozone, and classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991).Accordingly, the Copyright Office and the Library of Congress adopts the following rules.

ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is taking direct final action on revisions to the CaliforniaState Implementation Plan. The revisions concern rules from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD). This approval action will incorporate five rules into the Federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO X) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The rules control NO X emissions from boilers, steam generators, process heaters, stationary internal combustion engines, stationary gas turbines, and glass melting furnaces in the San Francisco Bay area. EPA has evaluated the rules and is taking direct final action to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA actions on SIP submittals, and SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards. The rules are being approved into the SIP in accordance with the area's ozone maintenance plan for redesignation to attainment. DATES: This action is effective on June 16, 1997 unless adverse or critical comments are received by May 19, 1997. If the effective date is delayed, a timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES : Copies of the rules and EPA's evaluation report for each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region IX office during normal business hours.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Applicability This document addresses EPA's direct final action for the following BAAQMD rules: Regulation 9, Rule 7, NitrogenOxides and Carbon Monoxide from Industrial, Institutional, and Commercial Boilers, Steam Generators, and Process Heaters; Regulation 9, Rule 8, Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Monoxide Emissions from Stationary Internal Combustion Engines; Regulation 9, Rule 9\u00d0Nitrogen Oxides from Stationary Gas Turbines; Regulation 9, Rule 11\u00d0Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Monoxide from Utility Electric Power Generating Boilers; and Regulation 9, Rule 12, Nitrogen Oxides from Glass Melting Furnaces. These BAAQMD rules were adopted on September 15, 1993, January 20, 1993, September 21, 1994, November 15, 1995 and January 19, 1994, respectively. They were submitted by the State of California on July 23, 1996. The rules were found to be complete on January 17, 1997, pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, Appendix V.1EPA is taking direct final action to approve all five rules into the SIP. Background On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. Pub. L. 101\u00b1549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401\u00b17671q. The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of NO Xemissions through reasonably available control technology (RACT) are set out in section 182(f) of the CAA. On November 25, 1992, EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Implementation of Title I; Proposed Rule,'' (the NO XSupplement) which describes the requirements of section 182(f). The November 25, 1992 document should be referred to for further information on the NO X requirements and is incorporated into this document by reference. Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act requires States to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO X (``major'' as defined in section 302 and section 182 (c), (d), and (e)) as are applied to major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in moderate or above ozone nonattainment areas.218711 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations 3See 60 FR 27028 (May 22, 1995). 4Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post-1987 ozone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); and ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988).Section 182(b)(2) requires submittal of RACT rules for major stationary sources of VOC emissions (not covered by a pre- enactment control technique guidelines (CTG) document or a post-enactment CTG document) by November 15, 1992. There were no NO XCTGs issued before enactment and EPA has not issued a CTG document for any NO Xcategory since enactment of the CAA. The RACT rules covering NO Xsources and submitted as SIP revisions are expected to require final installation of the actual NOXcontrols by May 31, 1995 for those sources where installation by that date is practicable. NOXemissions contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The five BAAQMD rules control emissions of NO Xfrom commercial and industrial boilers, steam generators, and process heaters; stationary internal combustion engines; stationary gas turbines; electric power generating boilers; and glass melting furnaces. The rules were adopted as part of the BAAQMD's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone, as well as to satisfy the mandates of the California State Clean Air Act requirements. They were submitted in response to the CAA requirements cited above. However, subsequent to the complete submittal of the BAAQMD NO Xrules pursuant to the CAA, the district applied for an exemption from the NO X RACT requirements pursuant to section 182(f)(3). The BAAQMD's exemption request was submitted along with amendments to the BAAQMD's request for redesignation to attainment of the ozone standard. The basis for the BAAQMD's exemption request was that the area had achieved the ozone standard, as demonstrated by three years of monitoring data, without having implemented the NO Xmeasures. While the BAAQMD had adopted and submitted the measures in response to both the State and Federal requirements, the emission reductions obtained by the rules would not occur until full implementation in the future. The district was able to demonstrate with three years of monitoring data that the Federal ozone standard was reached without having implemented the NO X control measures. Subsequently, EPA evaluated the exemption request and published an approval for the BAAQMD's petition for a NO XRACT exemption on May 22, 1995 (60 FR 27028). While the BAAQMD was no longer required to submit NO XRACT rules pursuant to section 182(b)(2), the BAAQMD incorporated several of the previously submitted NO Xrules ascontingency measures in its ozone maintenance plan as a requirement for redesignation to attainment. Since being redesignated to attainment of the ozone standard,3the Bay Area has recorded violations of the Federal ozone standard, therefore triggering the contingency measures of the maintenance plan. In accordance with the redesignation maintenance plan, and at the request of the BAAQMD, EPA is incorporating the NO Xmeasures into the SIP. The BAAQMD resubmitted the contingency measures being acted on in this document on July 23, 1996. This action encompasses part of the measures identified in the plan as contingency measures. EPA Evaluation and Action In determining the approvability of a NOXrule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110, and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for this action, appears in the NO XSupplement and various EPA policy guidance documents.4Among these provisions is the requirement that a NO Xrule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of NO Xemissions. However, because these measures are being incorporated into the SIP as maintenance measures for the area's redesignation plan, the rules are not being evaluated for meeting the RACT emission limits pursuant to section 182(f) of the CAA. Rather, the rules are being incorporated into the SIP as attainment maintenance measures for ozone. They are therefore being evaluated against the emissions reductions committed to in the maintenance plan, and SIP enforceability guidelines. EPA is approving these measures, although some areas for improvement have been identified. Refer to the technical support document, dated January 24, 1997, for further analysis of the rules and areas identified for improvement. The BAAQMD rules will strengthen and maintain the SIP and together are estimated to achieve 32.4\u00b134 tons per day of NO Xemissions upon full implementation. EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations and EPA policy. Therefore, all five rules are being approved under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the applicable requirements of section 110(a) and part D. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. EPA is publishing this document without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective June 16, 1997, unless, by May 19, 1997, adverse or critical comments are received. If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective June 16, 1997. Regulatory Process Unfunded Mandates Under Sections 202, 203, and 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (``Unfunded Mandates Act''), signed into law on March 22, 1995, EPA must undertake various actions in association with proposed or final rules that include a Federal mandate that may result in estimated costs of $100 million or more to the private sector or to State, local, or tribal governments in the aggregate. Through submission of this State implementation plan revision, the State and any affected local or tribal governments have elected to adopt the program provided for under part D of the Clean Air Act. These rules may bind State, local, and tribal governments to18712 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations perform certain actions and also require the private sector to perform certain duties. The rules being approved by this action will impose no new requirements because affected sources are already subject to these regulations under State law. Therefore, no additional costs to State, local, or tribal governments or to the private sector result from this action. EPA has also determined that this direct final action does not include a mandate that may result in estimated costs of $100 million or more to State, local, or tribal governments in the aggregate or to the private sector. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for- profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on affected small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256\u00b166 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. section 7410(a)(2).

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The EPA is issuing a limited approval, limited disapproval action on State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Rhode Island. The SIP revisions consist of the State's 15 Percent Rate of Progress (ROP) Plan and contingency plan. The 15 percent ROP and contingency plans were submitted to satisfy CAA provisions that require ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate and above to devise plans to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions 15 percent by 1996 when compared to a 1990 baseline. DATES: This rule is effective May 19, 1997. ADDRESSES : Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours, by appointment, at the Office of Ecosystem Protection, Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, One Congress Street, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts, 02203, and at the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, Division of Air Resources, 291 Promenade Street, Providence, Rhode Island, 02908\u00b15767. Persons interested in examining these documents should make an appointment with the appropriate office at least 24 hours before the visiting day. FORFURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Robert F.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : On October 30, 1996 (61 FR 55943), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Rhode Island. One portion of the NPR consisted of a proposed limited approval, limited disapproval of a revision to the Rhode Island SIP establishing a 15 Percent VOC emission reduction plan and contingency plan. The formal SIP revision was submitted by Rhode Island on March 15, 1994 and updated on May 23, 1994. The 15 Percent and Contingency plans submitted by Rhode Island outline18713 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations a strategy to reduce hydrocarbon emissions in the Providence, Rhode Island serious nonattainment area. The specific components of the State's plans and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) was the sole commenter on the NPR. Their comments are contained within a November 26, 1996 letter to Susan Studlien, Deputy Director, Office of Ecosystem Protection. The region has responded fully to the RI\u00b1DEM comments in a response to comments memorandum available in the docket for this action. A summary of these comments and EPA's responses appears below. Comment\u00d0Motor Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M): The DEM acknowledges that implementation of an I/M program has not yet occurred, but points out that much work has occurred over the past several years to initiate such a program. The DEM feels that EPA's recent flexibility in the design of such programs, while laudable, has made it difficult to finalize any particular program. A brief history of the State's efforts in this area is then provided. Response: EPA recognizes the actions taken to date by Rhode Island with regard to the implementation of an I/M program in the State. However, Rhode Island has not complied with the requirements of the Clean Air Act and EPA regulations which required that states start such programs by January 1, 1995. Rhode Island correctly notes that EPA has been modifying requirements to provide greater flexibility to states for I/M programs, and that EPA has allowed time for states to take advantage of these new provisions. The National Highway Systems Designation Act (NHSDA) provided an opportunity with a very short time window for states to submit test-and- repair programs without the penalty previously utilized by EPA for calculating emissions from such programs, and in addition provided time for program startup. The states which took advantage of this opportunity are required to start their programs no later than November 15, 1997 in order for a full two year test cycle to occur by November 15, 1999, the date for 15% plan compliance. (There is one NHSDA program that will not start until 1998, but it has a one year test cycle.) Rhode Island did not submit an I/M program under the NHSDA. Rhode Island is not implementing the program currently authorized in the State andhas not yet proposed a substitute program. It is EPA's understanding that Rhode Island currently envisions starting testing of motor vehicles in late 1998 or early 1999, and will most likely adopt a biennial program. That schedule puts the State about one year behind virtually all other States that need emission reductions from auto emissions testing to meet the 15 percent emission reduction requirement. Since Rhode Island's 15% plan relies heavily upon the emission reductions from a motor vehicle emission testing program, the timeframe for achieving the 15 percent VOC reductions is similarly delayed. In an August 1996 memorandum from John Seitz and Margo Oge to the Regional Air Directors, EPA articulated that emission reductions from revised I/M programs that occur before November, 1999 will be allowed to count towards 15% plan emission reductions. The continued delay by Rhode Island in implementing a motor vehicle emission inspection program will make meeting the November 1999 target date increasingly difficult for the State. Comment\u00d0Other Deficiencies: The DEM notes that EPA's proposal identifies several minor discrepancies between EPA's calculation of appropriate emission reductions and the reductions calculated by the State, as described below: 1. Comment\u00d0Submittal of Drafts, AIM Credit: The RI\u00b1DEM notes that they had submitted the regulations relied upon within the 15% plan, as well as the 15% plan itself, to EPA in draft form. EPA reviewed and commented on the draft regulations and the draft 15% plan, and should have identified these minor problems through that process but did not. Several of the problems cited, for example, the lack of inclusion of windshield wiper fluid in the consumer and commercial products rule, could have easily been addressed at that time. Additionally, EPA changed the amount of credit states could take due to the EPA's pending national rule on architectural and industrial maintenance (AIM) coatings after Rhode Island submitted its 15% plan. The DEM feels that the EPA's delay in proposing approval or disapproval of the State's plan should not be grounds for discounting credit due to a revised estimate of the emission reductions from the pending AIM rule. Response: The DEM's 15% plan, and four VOC control regulations relied upon in the plan to achieve emission reductions were submitted in early 1994. EPA used the best information available at the time drafts of these documents were submitted to reviewand analyze the emission reduction claims made by the state, and made a good faith effort to identify all errors at that time. A minor discrepancy (0.05 tons per day) in the amount of credit claimed from plant shutdowns was not detected at that time, but was noted subsequent to the final submittal by the state. During 1995, EPA finalized a report to Congress on VOC emissions from the consumer and commercial product category. Information contained in that report allowed EPA to perform a detailed analysis of the emission reductions claimed by Rhode Island from its rule on this emission source category. That review disclosed that the State had overestimated the emission reductions likely to result from this rule. EPA agrees that Rhode Island correctly calculated the amount of credit likely to occur from the EPA's pending AIM rule based on EPA guidance available at the time of the State's submittal. However, EPA later revised the emission reduction estimate downward based on a better understanding of what the provisions of the final rule would be. The DEM could have revised its plan in light of the new guidance. EPA believes that the best information available should be used in making determinations on the emission reductions within the 15% plan, and therefore feels that the most recent guidance memorandum on credit from the AIM rule is the appropriate tool to use to analyze the State's credit claim. With regard to delays by EPA in processing the State's SIP, EPA did not feel it was appropriate to move forward with an approval or disapproval of Rhode Island's 15% plan given the uncertain status of the State's auto emission testing program. EPA chose to propose disapproval of the State's plan when it became clear that significant delays were occurring in the implementation of the program. 2. Comment\u00d0Air Toxics and Non- Control Technique Guideline (CTG) Reductions: The DEM's comments reflect that EPA's only reason for not approving the emission reduction credit generated by these programs is that they have not been submitted to EPA as SIP revisions. The DEM notes that since the reductions have occurred, according to the Transportation Conformity Regulation, these deficiencies could be protected by a protective finding and should not trigger the transportation consequences indicated in the proposed disapproval. Response: Section 182(b)(1)(C) of the Clean Air Act requires creditable reductions to be in a State's implementation plan, EPA rules, or18714 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations Title V permits. As discussed within the proposed action, Rhode Island can receive credit from these programs by incorporating the relevant documents into the State's SIP. The DEM's claim that pursuant to the EPA's Transportation Conformity Regulation these deficiencies could be protected by a protective finding is not correct. EPA's rationale for not proposing to institute a protective finding was based on the failure of the state to implement an auto emission testing program, not on the failure to incorporate air toxics and non-CTG orders into the State's SIP. The failure to implement the auto emission testing program has made the State's mobile source emission budget unrealistic, and therefore a protective finding was not proposed. 3. Comment\u00d0Basis for Proposed Disapproval: The DEM notes their understanding that based on conversations with EPA staff, the non- I/M deficiencies noted in the proposed disapproval would not of themselves have led EPA to propose disapproval of the State's 15% plan, and that a recalculation of the State's 15% plan using updated growth assumptions could negate the need for these non- I/ M reductions. DEM requests that EPA's final rule should clearly state that the failure to secure I/M reductions formed the basis of EPA's action, and that the other issues may not be an issue once the ROP calculations are updated. Response: EPA agrees that it based its proposed disapproval action primarily on the failure of the State to secure I/ M reductions. The proposed disapproval notice contained a table outlining the magnitude of the noncreditable emission reductions from which it can clearly be seen that the failure to achieve reductions from I/M caused the majority of the shortfall. EPA also agrees that the other issues may not be of consequence once the State revises its plan. It is possible that the State will design and implement an I/M program that will achieve sufficient reductions to yield an approvable 15% plan without addressing EPA's issues on the non-I/M elements of the plan. But a great deal depends on the design and timing of Rhode Island's I/M program, which is still so uncertain that EPA cannot predict whether Rhode Island will ultimately need to revise the non-I/M elements of its plan. Additionally EPA notes that the State's current intention to revise its 15% plan to incorporate updated growth assumptions presents an opportunity for the State to make these minor corrections and to submit the SIP revisions necessary to make the non-CTG and air toxics emissionreductions creditable towards the 15% reduction. Comment\u00d0Proposed Action, Conformity Lapse: The DEM notes that EPA's proposal stipulates that a conformity lapse will occur 120 days after a final disapproval action, and that after the lapse no new project level conformity determinations may be made. The DEM agrees that this is consistent with EPA's current conformity rule, but points out that under a proposed revision to the EPA's conformity rule published in July of 1996, a lapse would be imposed 2 years after a final disapproval action, and that a conformity freeze rather than a lapse would be imposed 120 days after a final disapproval action. The DEM notes that the 15% plan was submitted in the Spring of 1994, and that EPA, by proposing action on the plan at this point in time, gives the appearance of attempting to rush the action through so that a lapse will occur in the State instead of the less punitive freeze. The DEM feels this is inappropriate, particularly in light of the State's good faith efforts to implement I/M in the State. Accordingly, DEM urges EPA to delay finalizing the disapproval action until the conformity amendments are finalized. DEM, in turn, will continue to move forward with I/M as expeditiously as possible, and will introduce I/M legislation in January of 1997. The DEM also pledges to update its 15% plan and submit a revised plan to the EPA as an SIP revision. Response: EPA did not propose action on Rhode Island's 15% plan in the fall of 1996 in an attempt to ensure that a conformity lapse, rather than a freeze, occur. Contrary to Rhode Island's suggestion that EPA is hurrying this action, EPA has been exceedingly deliberate in its approach to Rhode Island's 15% plan and I/M program. The EPA has delayed action on most 15% plans because most of these plans relied substantially on the reductions from I/ M programs, and most I/M programs have been delayed. In 1995, EPA revised its criteria for acceptable I/M programs. The goal of the revised I/M criteria was to give states flexibility in the design of such programs. The NHSDA of 1995 outlines the EPA's revised I/M criteria, and set a timetable for States to implement the revised criteria. Rhode Island did not meet this timetable, and it was that failure that finally led EPA to propose disapproval of Rhode Island's 15% plan. Although EPA hopes that Rhode Island is committed to implementing I/M, the fact is that the State is significantly behind similar efforts being made by other States.On January 17, 1997, EPA's Regional Administrator sent a letter to Governor Almond addressing the issue of the timing of a conformity lapse. Within that letter, EPA notes that once the proposed revisions to the conformity rule are finalized, Rhode Island will be subject to their provisions, regardless of when the final disapproval action is published for the State's 15% plan. Therefore, if EPA's conformity rule is finalized as it was proposed, and prior to the expiration of the 120 day conformity lapse clock required by the current conformity rule, a conformity freeze rather than a lapse will be imposed on the state. If EPA's conformity rule is finalized after expiration of the 120 day clock, a lapse would go into effect. The lapse, however, would convert to a freeze once EPA's conformity rule is finalized, presuming the final conformity rule reflects the position on this issue articulated in the proposal. Final Action The EPA is issuing a limited approval, limited disapproval of the Rhode Island 15 Percent ROP and Contingency plans. The Rhode Island 15 Percent ROP plan will not achieve enough reductions to meet the requirements of section 182(b)(1) of the CAA. Additionally, the portion of the State's contingency plan consisting of the two VOC control regulations does not meet the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the CAA. These regulations are triggered upon failure of the State to meet ROP requirements, but are not also triggered by failure of the State to attain the NAAQS for ozone by the area's attainment date as required by section 172(c)(9). In light of these deficiencies, the EPA cannot grant full approval of these plan revisions under Section 110(k)(3) and Part D. However, the EPA may grant a limited approval of the submitted plans under section 110(k)(3) and section 301(a) since the rules making up the 15 Percent Plan and the Contingency Plan will result in VOC emission reductions and will strengthen the SIP. Thus, the EPA is issuing a limited approval of the Rhode Island 15 Percent Plan and Contingency Plan under sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the CAA. The EPA is also issuing a limited disapproval of the Rhode Island 15 Percent plan under sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) because the submittal does not fully meet the requirements of section 182(b)(1) of the CAA for the 15 Percent Rate of Progress Plans, and the plan does not achieve the required emission reductions. In addition, the EPA is issuing a limited disapproval of18715 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations 1Protective finding means a determination by EPA that the control strategy contained in a submitted control strategy implementation plan revision would have been considered approvable with respect to requirements for emission reductions if all committed measures had been submitted in enforceable form as required by Clean Air Act section 110(a)(2)(A).the Rhode Island Contingency plan. The plan does not meet the requirements of sections 172(c)(9) and 182(c)(9) for contingency measures because the plan, if implemented, will not achieve the required 3 percent emission reduction. Additionally, the plan does not fully meet the requirements of section 172(c)(9) regarding implementation of contingency measures if the area's attainment date is not met according to the schedule outlined within the CAA. Rhode Island has expressed its intention to submit a revised vehicle I/ M program. The additional reductions from vehicle I/M may serve to correct the shortfall identified in this proposed Federal Register Action. Alternatively, Rhode Island could implement its existing I/M program. To gain full approval of its 15 percent plan, Rhode Island will need to submit a revised plan that documents the necessary enforceable reductions, such as those resulting from a revised I/M program or other enforceable measures, to meet the 15 percent rate of progress requirements and include sufficient contingency measures to achieve a 3 percent reduction. Under section 179(a)(2), if the Administrator disapproves a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated nonattainment based on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, the Administrator must apply one of the sanctions set forth in section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months of such disapproval. Section 179(b) provides two sanctions available to the Administrator: The imposition of emission two for one offset requirements, and loss of certain highway funding. The 18-month period referred to in section 179(a) will begin on the effective date established in the final limited disapproval action. If the deficiency is not corrected within 6 months of the imposition of the first sanction, the second sanction will apply. This sanctions process is set forth at 59 FR 39832 (Aug. 4, 1994), to be codified at 40 CFR 52.31. Moreover, within two years of the final disapproval of a required SIP submission, the EPA shall promulgate a federal implementation plan (FIP) under section 110(c). On January 18, 1995, the EPA made a completeness determination on the Rhode Island 15 percent plans with an approval of the established motor vehicle emission budget for use in transportation conformity determinations. Because the motor vehicle emission budget is based to a significant extent upon an I/M program not being implemented by Rhode Island,EPA has determined that budget is no longer credible. EPA, therefore, is rescinding the protective finding1 through this final disapproval action. EPA is notifying the State, the Metropolitan Planning Organizations, the U.S. Federal Highway Agency, and the U.S. Federal Transit Administration of the effect of a disapproval action on conformity in Rhode Island. Under the current Transportation Conformity Regulations, the conformity status of the transportation plan and transportation improvement program shall lapse 120 days after the effective date of EPA's final disapproval without a protective finding, and no new project-level conformity determinations may be made. Furthermore, no new transportation plan, TIP, or projects may be found to conform until another control strategy implementation plan revision fulfilling the same Clean Air Act requirements is submitted, found complete, and conformity to this submission is determined. The timeframe for the conformity lapse, which as discussed above is 120 days after the effective date of EPA's final disapproval action, could be changed by a revision to EPA's conformity rule. On July 9, 1996, EPA published (61 FR 36112) a proposed rule which would modify the Transportation Conformity rule. A key provision contained in the proposal was a change in the penalty that occurs 120 days after a final disapproval action. Instead of a lapse, a less punitive conformity freeze was proposed to occur in 120 days. In EPA's proposed conformity rule revision, the more restrictive lapse would be imposed 2 years after a final disapproval action. Therefore, if the conformity rule is finalized as proposed, the conformity lapse will take place 2 years from the effective date of the final disapproval action, and a freeze would be imposed in the period between 120 days and 2 years following the effective date of this action. Rhode Island will ultimately be subject to the provisions contained in EPA's final conformity rule. Nothing in this proposed rule should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, andenvironmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Administrative Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214\u00b12225), as revised by a July 10, 1995 memorandum from Mary Nichols, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from review under Executive Order 12866. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for- profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301, and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v U.S. EPA, 427 US 246, 256\u00b166 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). The EPA's limited disapproval of the State request under sections 110 and 301, and subchapter I, Part D of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this limited disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover, the EPA's limited disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, the EPA certifies that this limited disapproval action does not18716 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements, nor does it impose any new Federal requirements. C. Unfunded Mandates Under Sections 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (``Unfunded Mandates Act''), signed into law on March 22, 1995, EPA must prepare a budgetary impact statement to accompany any proposed or final rule that includes a Federal mandate that may result in estimated costs to State, local, or tribal governments in the aggregate; or to the private sector, of $100 million or more. Under Section 205, EPA must select the most cost- effective and least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule and is consistent with statutory requirements. Section 203 requires EPA to establish a plan for informing and advising any small governments that may be significantly or uniquely impacted by the rule. EPA has determined that the approval action promulgated does not include a Federal mandate that may result in estimated costs of $100 million or more to either State, local, or tribal governments in the aggregate, or to the private sector. This Federal action approves pre-existing requirements under State or local law, and imposes no new requirements. Accordingly, no additional costs to State, local, or tribal governments, or to the private sector, result from this action. D.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the Governor of Colorado for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10) in the Denver area. The SIP revisions were submitted to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM 10SIP for Denver and, among other things, contain enforceable control measures. The bulk of the revisions were submitted on March 30, 1995. Revisions to Colorado Regulation No. 13 (oxygenated fuels), which is one of the control measures relied on in the SIP, were adopted by the Air Quality Control Commission18717 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations 1The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Pub. L. No. 101\u00b1549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. 2Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and Subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM 10 nonattainment areas. At times, Subpart 1 and Subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's notice and supporting information.(AQCC) on October 19, 1995 and submitted to EPA on December 22, 1995. EPA proposed to approve the March 30, 1995 submission on October 3, 1996. On December 6, 1996, EPA published a supplemental proposal to approve the Denver PM 10SIP based on the October 19, 1995 version of Regulation No. 13 rather than the prior version. This action supersedes EPA's July 25, 1994, final limited approval of certain control measures found in the State's June 7, 1993 Denver PM 10SIP submittal.

FORFURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Callie Videtich at (303) 312\u00b16434. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : I. Background The Denver, Colorado area was designated nonattainment for PM 10and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.1See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and 40 CFR 81.306 (specifying PM 10nonattainment designation for the Denver metropolitan area). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are set out in Part D, Subparts 1 and 4, of Title I of the Act.2 The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM 10nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of Title I advanced in this action and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action on the Colorado moderate PM 10SIP for the Denver nonattainment area, EPA is applying its interpretations considering the specific factual issues presented. Those States containing initial moderate PM 10nonattainment areas (those areas designated nonattainment under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among other things, the following plan provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. Some provisions were due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a new source review (NSR) permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM 10by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). On January 14, 1993, the State submitted regulation revisions for the construction of new and modified major stationary sources. On August 18, 1994, EPA partially approved the State's NSR program for the Denver PM 10nonattainment area because the State had not yet submitted NSR provisions for sources of PM 10 precursors (i.e., NO Xand SO 2) in theDenver area (see 59 FR 42300). On August 25, 1994, Colorado submitted additional NSR provisions for precursor emissions. EPA took final action on that SIP submittal on January 21, 1997 (62 FR 2910). Thus, the State has a fully- approved NSR permitting program in place for the Denver moderate PM 10 nonattainment area. States were also required to submit contingency measures for PM 10 moderate nonattainment areas by November 15, 1993. The contingency measures for the Denver PM 10 nonattainment area were initially submitted by the Governor on December 9, 1993. However, those control measures were later incorporated into the revised March 30, 1995 PM 10SIP to help demonstrate attainment and maintenance. Thus, the State developed new contingency measures, and on November 17, 1995, the Governor submitted those measures to EPA. EPA took direct final rulemaking action on the contingency measures SIP submittal on September 23, 1996 (61 FR 49682). Because no adverse comments were received for the direct final rulemaking, the rule became effective on December 23, 1996. On June 7, 1993, the Governor submitted a SIP for Denver to EPA which was intended to satisfy those elements due November 15, 1991. On December 20, 1993, EPA proposed to conditionally approve that SIP and also proposed to approve the SIP's control measures for their limited purpose of strengthening the Colorado SIP (58 FR 66326). On July 25, 1994, EPA granted limited approval of the control measures for the limited purpose of strengthening the SIP (59 FR 37698). During review of the technical information supporting the June 1993 SIP, EPA examined information which raised concerns about the accuracy of the SIP's attainment demonstration. The SIP's technical support documentation suggested that the contribution from PM10``precursors'' ( i.e., NOXand SO 2) in the base year winter season may have been underestimated. Since the attainment demonstration provided with that SIP predicted a value of 149.9 \u00b5g/m3over 24 hours, virtually any increase in precursor PM 10levels would result in predicted violations of the 24- hour standard. In the December 20, 1993, proposed rulemaking action, EPA requested public comment on its proposal to grant conditional approval of the SIP in light of the precursor issue. EPA reviewed the information submitted during the public comment period and concluded that precursors were underestimated by 5.4 \u00b5g/m.3Based upon this finding, EPA18718 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations delayed taking final action on the proposed conditional approval to allow the State an opportunity to develop additional controls to offset this increase. EPA never proceeded with the conditional approval. On March 30, 1995, the Governor submitted a SIP revision intended to provide controls to offset the increase in precursor emissions and provide credible attainment and maintenance demonstrations. Based on this SIP revision, EPA proposed approval of the PM10SIP on October 3, 1996 (61 FR 51631). On July 18, 1995, and April 22, 1996, the Governor submitted additional revisions to the SIP which establish mobile source emissions budgets for PM10and NO X. These budgets are used under EPA regulations for making transportation related conformity determinations as required by section 176(c) of the Act. EPA's transportation conformity rule provides that these budgets establish a cap on motor vehicle-related emissions which cannot be exceeded by the predicted transportation system emissions in the future unless the cap is amended by the State and approved by EPA as a SIP revision and attainment and maintenance of the standard can be demonstrated. EPA proposed approval of these emissions budgets on October 3, 1996 along with the Denver PM 10SIP. However, EPA is not taking final action on the two emissions budgets in order to more thoroughly consider comments received during the public comment period. These emissions budgets are not necessary to meet the Act's requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas and, therefore, will be addressed in a separate rulemaking. EPA became aware after proposing approval of the PM 10SIP that the version of Regulation No. 13 (oxygenated fuels) that was one of the control measures relied on in the Denver PM 10SIP had been replaced by the October 19, 1995 version of Regulation No. 13. The Governor submitted this version to EPA as a SIP revision on December 22, 1995. The October 19, 1995 version eliminates the last two weeks from the program and calls for a 3.1% program rather than a 2.7% program. On December 6, 1996 (61 FR 64647) EPA published a supplemental document that, among other things, proposed to approve the Denver PM 10SIP with the October 19, 1995 version of Regulation No. 13 substituted for the prior version. EPA received no comments regarding this aspect of the supplemental document and is proceeding with its approval of the Denver PM 10SIP based on theOctober 19, 1995 version of Regulation No. 13. EPA has already approved the October 19, 1995 version of Regulation No. 13 as part of the Denver carbon monoxide (CO) SIP. The acting Regional Administrator for EPA Region VIII signed a Federal Register document approving the Denver CO SIP on January 31, 1997, but at the time this document was prepared, that approval had not yet been published in the Federal Register . II. Response to Public Comments EPA received numerous comments on its proposed approval of the Denver PM10SIP and the PM 10and NO X emissions budgets. In this document, EPA is addressing only those comments submitted on the Denver PM 10SIP. The comments received regarding the emissions budgets will be addressed in a later rulemaking action. The comments received on the Denver PM 10 SIP and EPA's responses follow. 1. The SIP revision fails to contain control measures to limit motor vehicle emissions from current vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or revised projections of VMT growth and does not provide for attainment. As EPA noted in its approval of the Denver CO SIP, the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) produced revised estimates of daily vehicle miles traveled in the summer and fall of 1996. In early 1996, DRCOG made some improvements to its transportation demand model (used for transportation planning, and to produce estimates of future VMT and speeds for air quality planning purposes) and validated the model with actual 1995 traffic counts recorded in Denver. These adjustments led to revised estimates of approximately 49 million miles per day of traffic in the Denver area (the previous modeled estimate had been approximately 45 million miles per day). The commentor referred to these revised estimates and suggested that EPA should disapprove the SIP on this basis, or conditionally approve the SIP and request that the State submit additional controls. EPA believes that the increases in VMT are not sufficient to warrant revisions to the PM 10SIP or its disapproval. EPA believes that it is reasonable to allow some margin of error for VMT projections in attainment demonstrations. This is because these projections are by their nature inexact. For CO SIPs, EPA has recognized this in the General Preamble and other guidance (see 57 FR 13532 and Section 187 VMT Forecasting and Tracking Guidance, January 1992). EPA appliedthese policies in its approval of the Denver CO SIP and believes it is reasonable to extend them to the Denver PM10SIP. It must be emphasized that only part of the estimated VMT increase is due to actual growth in traffic in the Denver region; the rest is due to use of improved methodologies for traffic counting in the region. For this reason, EPA believes it is more appropriate to consider the impact of actual growth in VMT by examining counts based on a consistent methodology, that is, the HPMS-based VMT Tracking Program. In November 1996, Colorado submitted its 1996 report of 1995 actual annual VMT, as required by section 187 of the Act for CO SIPs. This report showed that actual 1995 VMT were 4.4% greater than the CO SIP projections and 1.3% greater than the most recent revised projection for 1995. These exceedances are within the allowable limits of EPA's VMT Tracking Program guidance for CO SIPs (5.0% and 3.0% for the respective VMT projections). EPA established these tolerances in recognition of the uncertainty inherent in attempting to measure actual VMT in a large urban area. Since the most recent reported actual annual VMT is within these allowable tolerances, EPA is not requiring the State to revise either the CO or PM 10SIPs. One other factor that should be noted is that virtually all of the growth in the metro area has occurred not in the downtown area, where the violations of the NAAQS have been monitored, but in outlying portions of the metro area. Thus, EPA would expect that VMT in the downtown area would increase at a lower rate than VMT for the metro area as a whole. This is supported by traffic counts at locations near downtown, which show that traffic in the central area increased at a rate of approximately 2\u00b13% per year between 1990 and 1995, even though DRCOG estimates that traffic has increased approximately 4.5% per year region wide. 2. Enforceability requirements of the Act are not satisfied for some control measures. EPA and the State lack enforcement authority for woodburning control measures relied on in the SIP. The commentor indicates that although the State's woodburning program requires that certification programs for new or replaced stoves be enforced through local building codes, there is no provision for enforcement by the State in the event the local government fails to adopt the certification requirement or fails to enforce the code. In fact, Regulation No. 4, Section II.A, prohibits the sale of wood stoves that do not meet the18719 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations emission standards of 40 CFR 60.532(b)(1) or (2). There is no exemption in the regulation for areas with local prohibitions. Thus, the State has the ability to directly enforce the certification program for woodburning stoves. And, because this provision will be part of the SIP, EPA and citizens will also be able to enforce it. For new and remodeled woodburning fireplaces, it is true that local building codes and ordinances serve as the primary mechanism for implementation and enforcement. However, Section VIII of Regulation No. 4 requires the local jurisdictions to implement and enforce the local codes and ordinances. The State has the authority to enforce this requirement for implementation and enforcement. (See 25\u00b17\u00b1115(l)(a), C.R.S.) Because this requirement is being approved by EPA, EPA and citizens will also have the ability to enforce it. Also, it appears that because these local codes and ordinances have been adopted as part of the SIP, the State may have the ability to enforce them directly pursuant to 25\u00b17\u00b1128(l), C.R.S. EPA is approving them as part of the SIP, which will enable EPA and citizens to enforce them. For any local jurisdiction that has not adopted the relevant provisions for fireplaces into a building code or ordinance as of January 1, 1993, Section VII.A of Regulation No. 4 prohibits the installation of a fireplace unless it is of a type specified in Section VII.A. The State may enforce this requirement. Because EPA is approving this requirement, EPA and citizens will also have the ability to enforce it. 3. VMT reduction measures are not adopted measures and are not enforceable. One commentor mentioned that several programs and projects administered by the Regional Transportation District (RTD) in Denver were included in the SIP modeling, but were not adopted as transportation control measures and/or made enforceable. These projects include RTD's MAC light rail line, bus service to Denver International Airport, and three discount/free bus pass programs. All of these programs have been implemented, and the SIP's assumption that these activities would continue to be implemented seems reasonable to EPA. The MAC light rail line is a vital transportation link to downtown and serves as the starting point for a second line proceeding down the southwest corridor, which has been approved and is under development, and a proposed third line in the southeast corridor, which is currently being evaluated as part of a Major Investment Study in thatcorridor. Bus service to the airport has been implemented, and there are no current plans to discontinue it. The discount bus pass programs mentioned in the SIP have proven quite popular, helping to ensure their continuation. It seems more reasonable for the SIP to assume that these RTD activities would continue than to assume they would be terminated. States are authorized to base SIP emission inventories on reasonable assumptions regarding the makeup of the transportation network in future years. Most of the inputs to the transportation modeling process represent informed assumptions, including the extent and location of population and employment, speeds, mode choice, and participation in trip- reduction activities. The impacts of these assumptions by their nature are impractical to make enforceable; there are no mechanisms through which the SIP can force population growth to occur in one area and not another, or can force citizens to participate in carpools or ride the bus. Likewise, assumptions about the future transportation network are reflected in the transportation data used to generate the inventory, but are not practical to make enforceable. Each transportation project in the transportation plan and Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) would have to be included in the SIP, and the SIP would have to be revised each time a new plan and TIP were generated. Also, many projects which do not reduce VMT still have a localized benefit for air quality such as the E470 beltway, which reduces CO in the central metro area. However, it would be inappropriate to include a VMT- and emissions-generating project like E470 in an SIP as a control measure. 4. Modeling. One commentor criticized the accuracy of DRCOG's transportation modeling, and cited concerns from Environmental Defense Fund's Michael Replogle. The commentor did not supply a copy of Mr. Replogle's testimony and EPA does not have it in its possession. Thus, EPA has no basis to respond to specific concerns Mr. Replogle might have had. However, EPA believes the transportation modeling for the SIP was adequate and consistent with EPA guidance. EPA's guidance (Procedures for Preparing Emissions Projections, EPA\u00b1450/4\u00b191\u00b1 019, July 1991) establishes minimum criteria for network modeling which DRCOG has met. In fact, DRCOG has exceeded guidance requirements, which would allow the use of less robust methods than network modeling. For example, the New York City CO SIP (which EPA has also approved) was notbased on network modeling. EPA's guidance generally advises states to use the best tools they have available. Neither EPA's inventory nor SIP guidance is written in such a way as to advance the state of the art of VMT modeling in areas required to prepare SIPs or to require these areas to address every identifiable shortcoming with their particular modeling techniques. Regarding the commentor's assertions about VMT growth since the SIP was submitted, the reader should refer to EPA's response, above, regarding this issue. 5. The regional network. One commentor stated that the DRCOG regional transportation network could not be properly used for SIP purposes because of inaccurate assumptions made within the modeling regarding whether certain projects would or would not be built. The commentor specifically noted that the construction of the final segment of E470 was not included in DRCOG's long-range transportation modeling, ostensibly because funding was not available for that project, while several light rail projects were included in the modeling even though funding for those projects is not certain. However, none of these projects were intended to be completed during the timeframe of the SIP's attainment and maintenance demonstrations (i.e., by the end of December 1998) and are not included in the SIP modeling. Thus, EPA's approval of the SIP is not affected in any way by the implementation or delay of these projects. The commentor also states that its ALTLOP\u00d0alternative list of projects\u00d0 would have produced lesser growth in PM10than DRCOG's list of projects. EPA notes that it cannot substitute its judgement for the State's or DRCOG's regarding which projects or controls to implement as long as the Act's requirements are met. The SIP demonstrates attainment and maintenance of the PM 10standard with the mix of projects selected by DRCOG. 6. Monitoring and air sampling. A commentor indicated that further information would be forthcoming relating to continuity of monitoring, siting of monitors and whether tire wear particles are properly accounted for. EPA did not receive any further information on this subject and so has no basis upon which to respond. It should be noted that Colorado's State- wide SIP, which includes the Denver monitoring network, was reviewed and approved by EPA on September 23, 1993 (see 58 FR 49434) as meeting the requirements of 40 CFR Parts 53 and 58, and the appendices to Part 50.18720 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations 3Carbon monoxide is not relevant to the PM 10 SIP. However, EPA is incorporating by reference Section IX of Regulation No. 1 that relates to CO to accurately reflect the reorganization of the regulation.4Permit changes for TRIGEN achieve PM 10SIP precursor emission reductions to accommodate precursor emission increases at the Rocky Mountain Bottle facility (formerly the Coors Glass Plant). While these revisions to the emissions limits are acceptable for meeting RACM/RACT requirements, EPA's action herein regarding these limits does not in any manner relieve these companies of the obligation to comply with any nonattainment NSR permitting requirements that might apply to such changes in emissions limits.7. Conformity. One commentor makes comments under this heading that go to the validity of the SIP. The commentor suggests that a value of 149.9 \u00b5g/m3is too close to the NAAQS of 150 \u00b5g/m3to be considered attainment, particularly when the projections used to effect this razor thin margin are acknowledged to have been ``low''. Regarding the 149.9 \u00b5g/m3value, EPA regulations dictate that this value is considered attainment of the standard. See 40 CFR 50.6 and Part 50, Appendix K. By ``projections'', EPA assumes the commentor is referring to the VMT projections relied on for the attainment and maintenance demonstrations. As explained in response to another comment, above, the difference between estimates of actual VMT and projections of VMT contained in the SIP falls within a reasonable margin of error and does not warrant a revision to or disapproval of the SIP. The reader should refer to the comment and response, above, for a more complete discussion of this issue. The last sentence of the commentor's comment appears to relate to the emissions budgets. EPA is not acting on the budgets in this action and will defer its response until it acts on the budgets. 8. Other. One commentor endorsed EPA's proposed approval of the Denver element of the PM 10SIP, citing air quality monitoring data collected since 1992 that is below the current standard as evidence that the plan is working. This comment requires no response. III. This Action EPA is approving the SIP revisions submitted by the Governor of Colorado for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the NAAQS for PM 10. The revisions were submitted to satisfy certain federal requirements for moderate PM 10nonattainment areas. The bulk of the revisions were adopted by the AQCC on October 20, 1994 with an amendment on December 15, 1994 and were submitted by the Governor on March 30, 1995. However, revisions to Regulation No. 13 (oxygenated fuels) were adopted by the AQCC on October 19, 1995 and submitted to EPA on December 22, 1995. EPA is basing its approval of the PM 10SIP on this October 19, 1995 version of Regulation No. 13 rather than the version relied on in the March 30, 1995 submission. Also, the State submitted a number of technical support documents to EPA after the original June 7, 1993 PM 10SIP submittal that explain or are relied on by the March 30, 1995 submittal and comprise part of the basis for EPA's approval. These documents were submitted on June 8, 1993, June 10, 1993, June 25, 1993, July 19, 1993,August 5, 1993, September 3, 1993, September 21, 1993, October 20, 1993, December 12, 1993, January 19, 1994, December 23, 1994, March 3, 1995, and November 8, 1995. It should be noted that the March 30, 1995 submission, in addition to including new control measures, also relies on control measures to which EPA granted limited approval on July 25, 1994 (59 FR 37698). The current action granting full approval to the PM 10SIP supersedes EPA's limited approval. To avoid confusion, EPA is referencing in the regulatory materials that are part of this document both new provisions and provisions to which EPA gave limited approval in its July 25, 1994 action. These later provisions include portions of Regulation No. 1 and Regulation No. 4 that, through administrative error, EPA inadvertently failed to reference in the incorporation by reference section of the July 1994 action. To correct this clerical error, EPA is now incorporating all of Regulation No. 4, and all of Regulation No. 1 except Section V. As noted in EPA's action of December 3, 1986 (51 FR 43610), the sources subject to Section V of Regulation No. 1 are no longer operating, and thus, there is no reason to act on Section V. EPA is approving the control strategies that are relied upon in the March 30, 1995 submission as well as the attainment and maintenance demonstrations contained therein. EPA views the following measures as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for PM 10emissions reductions in the Denver PM 10nonattainment area: (1) Colorado Regulation No. 4 which regulates residential wood burning; (2) local woodburning ordinances and resolutions; (3) Colorado Regulation No. 16 which establishes street sanding and sweeping requirements; (4) the federal tailpipe standards, which provide an ongoing benefit due to fleet turnover, and Colorado Regulations 11, 12, and 13 which were developed by the State and approved by EPA independently from the PM 10SIP but are included because of their particulate emission reduction benefit; (5) Colorado Regulation No. 1, which provides stationary source emission control regulations for particulates, smokes, carbon monoxide and sulfur oxides3; and (6) individual stationary source permit revisions for Public Service Company Cherokee facility, Purina Mills, Electron Corporation, TRIGEN\u00d0Colorado EnergyCorporation4, Rocky Mountain Bottle Company, Conoco Refinery, and Adolph Coors Brewery. The State's submission demonstrates attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994, with continued maintenance of the standard through December 31, 1997. A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions and their associated control measures (including available control technology) can be found in the Technical Support Document accompanying EPA's October 3, 1996 proposed approval of the Denver moderate PM 10nonattainment area SIP (61 FR 51631). As noted elsewhere in this action, EPA received comments on the proposed action to approve the Denver PM 10SIP. EPA believes that the responses set forth in this action adequately address the comments and is proceeding with the approval as proposed. EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions of the Act. EPA has determined that this action conforms to those requirements. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. IV. Executive Order (EO) 12866 This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214\u00b12225), as revised by a July 10, 1995 memorandum from Mary Nichols, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted these regulatory actions from EO 12866 review. V. Regulatory Flexibility Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify18721 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations that are less than 50,000. SIP revision approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval process does not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that this final rule would not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State actions. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S.E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256\u00b1266 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. section 7410(a)(2). VI. Unfunded Mandates Under section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (``Unfunded Mandates Act''), signed into law on March 22, 1995, EPA must prepare a budgetary impact statement to accompany any proposed or final rule that includes a Federal mandate that may result in estimated costs to State, local, or tribal governments in the aggregate, or to the private sector, of $100 million or more. Under section 205, EPA must select the most cost- effective and least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule and is consistent with statutory requirements. Section 203 requires EPA to establish a plan for informing and advising any small governments that may be significantly or uniquely impacted by the rule. EPA has determined that today's final approval action does not include a Federal mandate that may result in estimated costs of $100 million or more to either State, local or tribal governments in the aggregate, or to the private sector. These Federal actions approve pre-existing requirements under State or local law, and impose no new requirements. Accordingly, no additional costs to State, local or tribal governments, or to the private sector, result from these actions. VII. Submission to Congress and the General Accounting Office Under 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1)(A) as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, EPAsubmitted a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives and the Comptroller of the General Accounting Office prior to publication of the rule in today's Federal Register . This rule is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). VIII. Petitions for Judicial Review Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 16, 1997. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

[FR Doc. 97\u00b19948 Filed 4\u00b116\u00b197; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560\u00b150\u00b1P DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 74\u00b114; Notice 116] RIN 2127\u00b1AG14 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Occupant Crash Protection Child Restraint Systems AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Interim final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This document amends Standard No. 213, ``Child Restraint Systems,'' to modify the air bag warning label which rear-facing child seats are required to bear beginning May 27, 1997. This document responds to a request from Mercedes-Benz, asking that the standard allow for additional wording in the required text of the label. NHTSA by this document makes final on an interim basis the amendment requested by Mercedes, which would clarify the warning and which would not lessen the safety of child restraints. The agency also solicits comments on this amendment. Because this amendment will clarify the required warning label and will relieve a restriction currently imposed by the standard, NHTSA has determined that it is in the public interest to make the changes effective immediately on an interim basis. Assuming that a final ruleis issued, the final rule would respond to any comments and would be effective upon publication in the Federal Register . DATES: Effective April 11, 1997. Comments must be received by June 2, 1997. ADDRESSES : Comments should refer to the docket and notice numbers above and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Docket hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Both can be reached at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh St., S.W., Washington, D.C., 20590. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : This document amends Standard No. 213, ``Child Restraint Systems,'' on an interim basis to modify the air bag warning label which rear-facing child seats are required to bear beginning May 27, 1997. This document also solicits comments on this amendment. The requirement for the label was adopted by a November 27, 1996 final rule (61 FR 60206),1which also adopted new warning label requirements for vehicles with air bags. The labels will help reduce the adverse effects of air bags, especially for children, by increasing the number of people who place child restraints in the rear seat instead of the front. The requirement for the enhanced child seat label is set forth in S5.5.2(k) of Standard 213. The requirement specifies, among other things, the exact content of the message that must be provided by the label. The message of the label must be preceded by a heading (``WARNING''), with an alert symbol, and state the following: DO NOT place rear-facing child seat on front seat with air bag. DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY can occur. The back seat is the safest place for children 12 and under. Also required for the label is a pictogram showing a rear- facing child seat being impacted by an air bag, surrounded by a red circle witha slash across it. Flexibility as to the content of the label is not provided; thus, additional wording is not permitted. On April 2, 1997, Mercedes asked NHTSA to amend the warning label for child restraints that meet certain criteria. Mercedes has developed a rear- facing child restraint system that has a device that automatically cuts off the passenger-side air bag in vehicles designed to respond to such a device. Mercedes intends to market this child restraint initially to customers purchasing vehicles without rear seats, and that are equipped with the cutoff feature. The cutoff feature makes it possible to safely use a child restraint system on the front seat of these vehicles without subjecting the child to risk of injury from an air bag deployment. While NHTSA recommends that any child be in the rear seat of a vehicle equipped with one, if Mercedes later installs the cutoff feature in vehicles with rear seat, the cutoff feature will avoid the risk of injury from an air bag deployment if a rear-facing child seat in used on the front seat. Mercedes believes that the first statement (``DO NOT place rear- facing child seat on front seat with air bag'') is inappropriate for child restraints with a feature to turn off the air bag. It could also be potentially confusing to owners of these vehicles who have such a child restraint, when they have been instructed that the child restraint will automatically deactivate the air bag and thus can be used on the front seat. The amendment requested by Mercedes would amend the sentence stating ``DO NOT place rear-facing child seat on front seat with air bag'' by adding the phrase ``unless air bag is off.'' The statements on the air bag warning label were designed to improve the likelihood that people will read the label, understand its message, and place child restraint systems in the rear seat. The required phrase ``DO NOT place rear-facing child seat on front seat with air bag'' is incomplete and possibly confusing for child restraint systems, such as the Mercedes system, that automatically deactivate the air bag in vehicles, since those child restraints are intended for use on and marketed as appropriate for front seat positions on vehicles equipped with complimentary air bag cutoff devices. Adding the phrase ``unless air bag is off'' at the end of the statement clarifies the message and tailors it more appropriately for a system such as the one offered by Mercedes. Moreover, NHTSA already permits vehicles that have manual cutoff switches for the passenger-side18724 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations air bag to add the phrase ``unless air bag is off'' to the end of a warning about never placing a rear-facing child restraint in the front seat. (S4.5.1(b)(2) of Standard No. 208, as amended November 11, 1996.) Since NHTSA can see no diminution of safety resulting from this change, the agency tentatively amends the standard to accommodate Mercedes' request. The following restrictions would be placed on the ability to add the words. The phrase ``unless air bag is off'' may be added to a label on a child restraint, provided that the restraint is equipped with a device that\u00d0 (a) automatically deactivates the passenger-side air bag; and (b) activates a telltale light in the vehicle that complies with S4.5.4.3 of Standard 208. NHTSA believes these conditions are needed to ensure that a rear-facing child restraint will be safely used on a passenger seat with an air bag. These conditions reduce the likelihood that a child restraint would be used with an active air bag. Because this amendment clarifies a requirement and avoids possible confusion resulting from the required labeling, NHTSA finds for good cause that an immediate amendment of the requirement is in the public interest. Submission of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this rule. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion. If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation. 49 CFR Part 512. All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the notice will be considered, and will be available for examination in the docketat the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments on the notice will be available for inspection in the docket. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material. Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self- addressed, stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return the postcard by mail. Regulatory Analyses and Notices A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' This action has been determined to be ``nonsignificant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. The amendments pertain to optional label changes that are minor in nature. The agency concludes that the impacts of the amendments are so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is not required. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this notice under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule will not impose any new requirements or costs on manufacturers, but instead will permit a manufacturer to use an optional label on its child restraint if conditions on the use of the label are met. Further, since no price increases are associated with the rule, small organizations and small governmental units are not be affected in their capacity as purchasers of child restraints. C. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96\u00b1511), there are no requirements forinformation collection associated with this rule. D. National Environmental Policy Act NHTSA has also analyzed this rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it will not have a significant impact on the human environment. E. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) NHTSA has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined that this rule will not have significant federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. F. Civil Justice Reform This rule has no any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for species that comprise the deep-water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary because the second seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific halibut apportioned to the deep-water species fishery in the GOA has been caught. EFFECTIVE DATE: 1200 hrs, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), April 14, 1997, until 1200 hrs, A.l.t., July 1, 1997. FORFURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Thomas Pearson, 907\u00b1486\u00b16919. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulationsimplementing the FMP at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679. The prohibited species bycatch mortality allowance of Pacific halibut for the GOA trawl deep-water species fishery, which is defined at \u00a7679.21(d)(3)(iii)(B), was established by the Final 1997 Harvest Specifications of Groundfish for the GOA (62 FR 8179, February 24, 1997) for the second season, the period April 1, 1997, through June 30, 1997, as 300 mt. In accordance with \u00a7 679.21(d)(7)(i), the Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the second seasonal apportionment of the 1997 Pacific halibut bycatch mortality allowance specified for the trawl deep- water species fishery in the GOA has been caught. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for the deep-water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA. The species and species groups that comprise the deep-water species fishery are: all rockfish of the genera Sebastes Sebastolobus , turbot, arrowtooth flounder, and sablefish. Maximum retainable bycatch amounts may be found in the regulations at \u00a7679.20(e) and (f). Classification This action is required by 50 CFR 679.21 and is exempt from review U.S.C. 1801 14, 1997.

ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal. SUMMARY: This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking that would have added a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to CFM International (CFMI) CFM56\u00b13 and \u00b13B series turbofan engines. That action proposed to amend an existing AD and would have required the installation of a riveted oil distributor, Part Number (P/ N) 335\u00b1305\u00b1804\u00b10. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the manufacturer has advised the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that the entire CFM56\u00b13 and \u00b13B fleet has been retrofitted with the new riveted oil distributor, P/N 335\u00b1305\u00b1804\u00b10, and that there are no oil distributors, P/N 335\u00b1305\u00b1800\u00b10, presently in service. The FAA has therefore reviewed its position, and has concluded that the proposed actions are unnecessary. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to supersede an airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to CFM International (CFMI) CFM56\u00b13 and \u00b13B engines, was published in the FederalRegister on December 2, 1986 (51 FR 43383). The proposed rule would have amended the existing AD that requires initial and repetitive inspections of the transfer gearbox for radial driveshaft oil distributor looseness and condition of the spirolock. The proposed rule would have required a riveted oil distributor, Part Number (P/N) 335\u00b1305\u00b1804\u00b10, to be installed in accordance with CFMI CFM56\u00b13/\u00b13B Service Bulletin No. 72\u00b1 253, dated June 27, 1986, as a terminating action to the repetitive inspection program. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the manufacturer has advised the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that the entire CFM56\u00b13 and \u00b13B fleet has been retrofitted with the new riveted oil distributor, P/N 335\u00b1305\u00b1804\u00b10, and that there are no oil distributors, P/N 335\u00b1305\u00b1800\u00b10, presently in service, nor does the manufacturer plan to introduce any into service in the future. The installation of the riveted oil distributor provides a permanent fix for oil distributor looseness and eliminates the need for repetitive inspections. The FAA has therefore reviewed its position, and has concluded that the proposed actions are unnecessary. Accordingly, the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. Withdrawal of this final rule constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore, is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

Discussion The FAA has received a report indicating that, during power-up of a Boeing Model 757 series airplane, smoke and fire were coming from the lower left-hand side of the E1\u00b11 rack of the electrical equipment bay.Investigation revealed the source of ignition to be electrical arcing caused by chafing of wire bundles, having part numbers (P/N) W2608 and W4508, at the upper lip of stringer R\u00b123L at approximately station 450. These wire bundles had been improperly routed during incorporation of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 757\u00b124A0025, dated May 10, 1985, and Boeing Service Bulletin 757\u00b124A0025, Revision 1, dated December 17, 1987. Further investigation revealed that the protective grommets on the upper lip of stringer R\u00b123L were missing on several other Model 757 series airplanes that also had been modified in accordance with those service bulletins. These protective grommets are intended to prevent chafing of the wire bundles. These conditions, if not corrected, could result in smoke and fire at the E1\u00b11 rack of the electrical equipment bay. Explanation of Relevant Service Information The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 757\u00b1 24A0025, dated May 10, 1985, and Boeing Service Bulletin 757\u00b124A0025, Revision 1, dated December 17, 1987, which describe, among other things, procedures for replacement of certain grommets with new grommets or installation of a new grommet, if a certain grommet is improperly installed or missing. The FAA has also reviewed and approved Boeing Production Installation Drawing 288N4329, Revision H, which describes procedures for installation of a protective grommet on the upper edge of intercostal R\u00b123L at approximately station 450 between the intercostal and wire bundles having P/N's W2608 and W4508. Explanation of Requirements of Proposed Rule Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require the following: 1. Performing a one-time inspection to verify proper installation and to detect chafing and/or damage of the wire bundles, having P/N's W4508, W2608, and W2604, paying particular attention to the area where the wire bundles are routed through the web supports and the area over the upper edge of intercostal R\u00b123L; 2. Repairing of chafed or damaged rerouted wire bundles; 3. Loosening wire bundle clamps, adjusting wire bundles to achieve proper clearances, and retightening thewire bundle clamps, if the wire bundles are installed improperly; 4. Performing a one-time inspection to verify if certain protective grommets are installed properly and to detect missing grommets, and replacing improperly installed grommets with new grommets or installing new grommets, as applicable; 5. Performing a one-time inspection to determine if a protective grommet is installed on the upper edge between the intercostal and rerouted wire bundles having P/N's W2608 and W4508, at intercostal R\u00b123L at approximately station 450; and 6. Installing a protective grommet between the wire bundles and intercostal, if no protective grommet is installed. Accomplishment of the inspections and re-installation of affected wire bundles and protective grommets will prevent chafing of the wire bundles, which could result in smoke and fire at the E1\u00b11 rack of the electrical equipment bay. The replacement and certain grommet installations would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. Certain other installations would be required to be accomplished in accordance with Boeing Production Installation Drawing 288N4329. The repair would be required to be accomplished in accordance with Boeing Standard Wiring Practices Manual 20\u00b110\u00b113. Cost Impact There are approximately 62 Boeing Model 757 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 28 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. The cost of required parts would be nominal. Based on these figures, the cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,360, or $120 per airplane. The cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. Regulatory Impact The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and18728 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : In the Federal Register of January 3, 1997 (62 FR 552), FDA published a proposed rule that would prohibit the use of protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues in ruminant feeds. The agency took this action due to concerns about the18729 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules possible effects if transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, especially bovine spongiform encephalopathy, were to be spread through animal feed. (See the preamble to the January 3, 1997, proposal for a full discussion of this issue.) After considering the comments on the proposal, given the complex issues involved, the agency has decided to make this draft available to the general public under \u00a7\u00a7 10.40(f) and 10.80(d)(2). These provisions allow the agency to make this draft available for discussion of questions and concerns about the draft. In this instance, FDA is conducting this discussion by inviting written comments with questions and concerns about the draft which will be addressed in any final rule that is published. The agency emphasizes that the draft rule does not represent final agency action or the agency's final decision on this regulation. Interested persons may, on or before April 28, 1997, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this draft rule. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: April 15, 1997. William B. Schultz, Deputy Commissioner for Policy. The text of the draft rule is set forth below: For the reasons discussed in the preamble, FDA hereby issues a draft rule that would amend 21 CFR part 589 as follows: PART 589\u00d0SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED FROM USE IN ANIMAL FOOD OR FEED 1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 589 continues to read as follows: Authority : Secs. 201, 402, 409, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 342, 348, 371). 2. New \u00a7 589.2000 is added to subpart B to read as follows: \u00a7589.2000 Animal proteins prohibited in ruminant feed. (a) Definitions . (1) Protein derived from mammalian tissues means any protein- containing portion of mammalian animals, excluding: Blood and blood products; gelatin (including amino acids and dicalcium phosphate derived from gelatin); inspected and processed meat products which have been cooked and offered for human consumption (plate waste and used cellulosic food casings); milk products (milk and milkproteins); and any product whose only mammalian protein consists entirely of porcine protein. (2) Renderer means any firm or individual that processes slaughter byproducts, animals unfit for human consumption, or meat scraps. The term includes persons who collect such materials and subject them to minimal processing, or distribute them to firms other than renderers (as defined here) whose intended use for the products may include animal feed. The term includes renderers that also blend animal protein products. (3) Blender means any firm or individual which obtains processed animal protein from more than one source or from more than one species, and subsequently mixes (blends) or redistributes an animal protein product. (4) Feed manufacturer includes manufacturers of complete and intermediate feeds intended for animals, and includes on- farm in addition to off-farm feed manufacturing and mixing operations. (5) Nonmammalian protein includes proteins from nonmammalian animals. (6) Distributor includes distributors of complete and intermediate feeds intended for animals. (7) Ruminant means any member of the order of animals which has a stomach with four chambers (rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum) through which feed passes in digestion. The order includes, but is not limited to, cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, deer, elk, and antelopes. (b) Food additive status . The Food and Drug Administration has determined that protein derived from mammalian tissues for use in ruminant feed is a food additive subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). The use or intended use in ruminant feed of any material that contains protein derived from mammalian tissues causes the feed to be adulterated and in violation of the act, unless it is the subject of an effective notice of claimed investigational exemption for a food additive under \u00a7 570.17 of this chapter. (c) Requirements for renderers that are not included in paragraph (e) of this section . (1) Renderers that manufacture products that contain or may contain protein derived from mammalian tissues and that are intended for use in animal feed shall take the following measures to ensure that materials identified in paragraph (b) of this section are not used in the feed of ruminants: (i) Label the materials as follows: ``Do not feed to cattle or other ruminants''; and (ii) Maintain records sufficient to track the materials throughout their receipt, processing, and distribution and make the copies available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration. (2) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be exempted from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section if they: (i) Use exclusively a manufacturing method that has been validated by the Food and Drug Administration to deactivate the agent that causes transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) and whose design has been made available to the public; (ii) Use routinely a test method that has been validated by the Food and DrugAdministration to detect the presence of the agent that causes TSE's and whose design has been made available to the public. Products found to contain the agent that causes TSE's shall be labeled ``Not for Use in Animal Feed.'' Records of the test results shall be made available for inspection by the Food and Drug Administration; or (iii) Use exclusively a method for controlling the manufacturing process that minimizes the risk of the TSE agent entering the product and whose design has been made available to the public and validated by the Food and Drug Administration. (3) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be exempted from the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section if they use a permanent method, approved by FDA, to make a mark indicating the presence of the materials. If the marking is by the use of an agent that cannot be detected on visual inspection, the renderer must use an agent whose presence can be detected by a method that has been validated by the Food and Drug Administration and whose design has been made available to the public. (d) Requirements for protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors that are not included in paragraph (e) of this section . (1) Protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors that manufacture, blend, process, and distribute products that contain or may contain protein derived from mammalian tissues shall comply with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. (2) Protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors, shall be exempt from paragraphs (d)(1) of this section if they: (i) Purchase animal products from renderers that certified compliance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section or purchase such materials from parties that certify that the materials were purchased from renderers that certified compliance with paragraph (c)(2); or (ii) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section where appropriate. (3) Protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors shall be exempt from paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section if they: (i) Purchase animal protein products that are marked in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section or purchase such materials from renderers that certified compliance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or purchase such materials from parties that certify that the materials were purchased from renderers that certified compliance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section; or (ii) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section where appropriate. (4) Pet food products that are sold or are intended for sale at retail are exempt from the labeling requirements in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. However, if the pet food products are sold or are intended for sale as distressed or salvage items for possible use in ruminant feed, then such products shall be labeled in accordance with paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section, as appropriate. (5) Copies of certifications as described in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section,18730 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules shall be made available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration. (e) Requirements for persons that intend to separate mammalian and nonmammalian materials . (1) Renderers, protein blenders, feed manufacturers, distributors, haulers and others that manufacture, process, blend and distribute both protein products derived from mammalian tissues or feeds containing such products, and protein products from other animal tissues or feeds containing such products, and that intend to keep those products separate shall: (i) Comply with paragraphs (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section as appropriate except that the labeling requirement shall apply only to products derived from mammalian (other than pure porcine) tissues or feeds containing such products; (ii) In the case of a renderer, obtain nonmammalian or pure porcine materials only from single-species facilities; (iii) Provide for measures to avoid commingling or cross-contamination: (A) Maintain separate equipment or facilities for the manufacture, processing, or blending of such materials; or (B) Use clean-out procedures or other means adequate to prevent carry-over of protein derived from mammalian tissues into animal protein or feeds that may be used for ruminants; and (iv) Maintain written procedures specifying the clean-out procedures or other means, and specifying the procedures for separating mammalian (other than pure porcine) materials from nonmammalian materials from the time of receipt until the time of shipment. (2) Renderers, blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors will be exempted from appropriate requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if they meet the appropriate criteria for exemption under paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3), and paragraphs (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section. (f) Requirements for establishments and individuals that are responsible for feeding ruminant animals . Establishments and individuals that are responsible for feeding ruminant animals shall maintain copies of purchase invoices and labeling for all feeds containing animal protein products received, and make the copies available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration. (g) Adulteration and misbranding . (1) Animal protein products, and feeds containing such products, that are not in compliance with paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, excluding labeling requirements, will be deemed adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C) or (a)(4) of the act. (2) Animal protein products, and feeds containing such products, that are not in compliance with the labeling requirements of paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section will be deemed misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the act.

ACTION: Notice of amendments to CITES Appendices proposed by foreign countries and public meeting. SUMMARY: The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES or Convention) regulates international trade in certain animals and plants. Species for which trade is controlled are listed in Appendices I, II, and III to CITES. Any country that is a party to CITES may propose amendments to Appendix I or II for consideration by the other Parties. This notice announces the tentative negotiating positions of the United States on proposals submitted by Parties other than the United States and invites information and comments on these proposals in order to develop negotiating positions for the U.S. delegation. The proposals will be considered at the tenth regular Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP10) to be held in Harare, Zimbabwe, June 9\u00b1 20, 1997. DATES: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) will consider all comments received through May 9, 1997, in developing negotiating positions. In addition the public will have opportunity for input at a public meeting to be held on April 25, 1997 (see elsewhere in this notice). The Service plans to publish a notice of its negotiating positions prior to COP10.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Background The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, hereinafter referred to as CITES or the Convention, is an international treaty designed to regulate international trade in certain animal and plant species which are or may become threatened with extinction and are listed in Appendices to the Convention. Currently, 135 countries, including the United States, are CITES Parties. CITES calls for biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties, which review its implementation, make provisions enabling the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland to carry out its functions for the Parties, consider amendments to the list of species in Appendices I and II, consider reports presented by the Secretariat, and make recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the Convention. The tenth regular meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP10) will be held in Harare, Zimbabwe, June 9\u00b120, 1997. This notice is part of a series of notices which, together with public meetings, encourage the public to participate in the development of the U.S. positions for COP10. In a March 1, 1996 Federal Register notice (61 FR 8019), the Service requested public recommendations or draft proposals to amend Appendix I or II that the United States might consider proposing at COP10. That notice described the provisions of CITES for listing species in the Appendices and set forth information requirements for proposals, based on new listing criteria adopted by the Parties at COP9. Federal Register notices on August 28, 1996 (61 FR 44324) and December 20, 1996 (61 FR 67293) requested additional comments from the public on species proposals still being considered after review of materials received in response to the March 1, 1996, notice. On the basis of a thorough review of comments received, the Service identified those proposals that met the listing criteria and presented the most compelling bases for amending the Appendices. These proposals to amend the Appendices were submitted to the CITES Secretariat on January 10, 1997, to be considered and voted upon by the Parties at COP10. The decisions on the various proposals and the rationale for each will be published in another Federal Register notice.18732 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules This notice announces proposals submitted by Parties other than the United States for consideration at the forthcoming meeting of the Parties and sets forth tentative negotiating positions of the United States on foreign proposals. CITES regulates import, export, re-export, and introduction from the sea of certain animal and plant species. Species for which trade is controlled are included in three Appendices. Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction that are or may be affected by trade. Appendix II includes species that although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in them is strictly controlled. It also includes species that must be subject to regulation in order that trade in other currently or potentially threatened species may be brought under effective control (e.g., because of difficulty in distinguishing specimens of currently or potentially threatened species from those of other species). Appendix III includes species that any Party nation identifies as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for purposes of preventing or restricting exploitation, and for which it needs the cooperation of other Parties in controlling trade. Any Party nation may propose amendments to Appendices I and II for consideration at the meetings of the Conference of the Parties. The text of any proposal must be communicated to the CITES Secretariat at least 150 days before the meeting. The Secretariat must then consult the other Parties and appropriate intergovernmental agencies, and communicate their responses and the Secretariat's own findings and recommendations to all Parties no later than 30 days before the meeting. Amendments to the Appendices are adopted by a two-thirds majority of the Parties present and voting. Information Sought The Service solicits comments on tentative negotiating positions for the United States on proposed species amendments submitted by Parties other than the United States. Information is also sought on the biological status of the affected species, on the amount and type of trade in specimens of the species, and on the impact of trade on their populations, especially as it relates to any potential effects on survival of the species in all or parts of its range.Comments that provide this information based on the new criteria for adding or removing species from the Appendices (Resolution Conf. 9.24) would be especially helpful. The Service will solicit comments on tentative U.S. positions for items on the COP10 agenda other than proposed amendments to the Appendices, in another Federal Register notice. The present, tentative negotiating positions for the United States are based mainly on review of information presented in the proposals submitted by proponents and in terms of the criteria in Resolution Conf. 9.24, adopted at COP9. Several proposals have not yet been fully translated into English from the Spanish or French. Because information provided in some of the proposals or otherwise available to the Service is too incomplete to allow a thorough review of their merits, several of the tentative negotiating positions presented may be revised as additional biological and trade data are obtained. Final guidance for the delegation is to be based on the best available biological and trade information, including comments received in response to this notice and discussions at COP10 with other governments, scientists, and technical experts. Proposals In accordance with the provisions of Article XV, paragraph 1(a) of the Convention the following CITES Parties, in addition to the United States, have submitted proposals for changes to Appendices I and II of the Convention: Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Botswana, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Cuba, Denmark, Finland, Germany, India, Japan, Jordan, Madagascar, Mexico, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, South Africa, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. A total of 63 proposals on plant and animal species were submitted by countries other than the United States, including 9 proposals that were submitted based on the ``Periodic Review'' concept first adopted at the 1981 Conference of the Parties in New Delhi, India. The Periodic Review process seeks to correct or clarify the inclusion of species listed at the Plenipotentiary Conference and COP1, before listing criteria were adopted. Some of the proposals submitted bySwitzerland under this process recommend the deletion from the Appendices of those species that have not been reported in trade, unless the species should be included in Appendix II because of similarity in appearance to related taxa that do appear in trade. It is the U.S. position (and has been at earlier COPs) that the lack of reported trade for some species should not be the sole basis for their deletion from the Appendices. The lack of reported trade for some species proposed for deletion from the Appendices may be due to (1) their rarity, (2) effective limits on trade by range States for the benefit of the species in that the range States may determine that trade would be detrimental to the survival of the species, or (3) the lack of proper documentation on the reporting of trade. Consequently, the Service does not believe that lack of appearance in trade is, by itself, a sufficient reason to warrant the removal of a taxon from the Appendices. In establishing a tentative negotiating position on these ``Periodic Review'' delisting proposals, the Service considered the degree of vulnerability of the species and the likelihood of it entering trade, and the net conservation effect of delisting. Proposals submitted by Parties other than the United States are listed in the following table. Tentative negotiating positions and the basis for making them are indicated. These tentative positions were developed largely on the basis of the information contained in the proposals unless the Service has information on the species in its files, particularly from earlier COPs or meetings of permanent CITES committees. If insufficient population and/or trade information was provided, the United States' current position is to either oppose the proposal or consider it still under review, depending upon the particular circumstances, pending receipt of additional information. The complete text of each proposal received is available for public inspection at the Service's Office of Scientific Authority (see ADDRESSES above). The text of any referenced resolution from previous meetings of the Conference of the Parties is available from the Service's Office of Scientific Authority or Office of Management Authority. Proposed amendments and tentative United States negotiating positions are as follows:18733 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules Species Proposed amendment ProponentTentative U.S. posi- tion Mammals Order Diprotodontia: Burramys Cetacea: Eschrichtius robustus (Gray whale) .....Transfer of the Eastern Pacific stock from Appendix I to II .Japan...................................

Although it is clear that the European populations of this species not presently included in Appendix I meet the criteria for Appendix I, the United States is not presently convinced by the proposal or other information that the remaining populations proposed for transfer to Appendix I qualify. Russian populations are subject to a managed sport harvest that appears to be in itself sustainable, but these populations in particular are prone to illegal take for medicinal products. The proposal remains under review, while the United States seeks additional information on the magnitude of the threat of illegal trade in Rus- sian and eastern Asian populations to determine if the proposal is warranted in its entirety. 4The proposal acknowledges that the jaguar population proposed for phased-in trophy-hunting may be the most threatened population in the country. The United States opposes this proposal without (a) a more convincing case that trophy hunting will not add to existing pressure on the jaguar population and (b) a management plan involving comprehensive population monitoring in the affected area. 5Annotated to allow: (a) The direct export of registered stocks of wholeraw tusks of Botswana origin to one trading partner (Japan) subject to annual quotas of 12.68 t. in 1998 and 1999; (b) international trade in hunting trophies; and (c) international trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable destinations. 6The proposal presents biological information that supports the proposed action. 7The Panel of Experts report on this proposal noted deficiencies in the record-keeping system for the ivory stockpile and showed there is no clear plan for use of ivory revenues to benefit elephant conservation. It also noted the existence of some movement of ivory through the country. The United States has concerns about these reported deficiencies and about the adequacy of trade controls in the importing country. 8The United States is consulting other African elephant range states to determine whether adoption of this proposal by the Parties would cause conservation concerns in other portions of the species' range. 9Annotated to allow: (a) The direct export of registered stocks of whole raw tusks of Namibian origin owned by the government of Namibia to one trading partner (Japan) that will not re-export, subject to annual quotas that will not exceed 6900 kg. between September 1997 and August 1998 and between September 1998 and August 1999; (b) international trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable destinations for non- commercial purposes; and (c) international trade in hunting trophies for non-commercial purposes. 10Although noting there is probably some movement of ivory through the country, the Panel of Experts reported satisfactory to excellent inter- nal management controls in Namibia and an excellent legal structure for establishing a conservation fund with ivory stock sale revenues. The Panel concluded that the proposal would likely benefit elephant conservation in Namibia. The United States has concerns about the adequacy of trade controls in the importing country. 11Annotated to allow: (a) The direct export of registered stocks of whole raw tusks to one trading partner (Japan) subject to annual quotas of 10 t. in 1998 and 1999; b) international trade in hunting trophies; c) international trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable destinations; d) international trade in non-commercial shipments of leather articles and ivory carvings; and e) export of hides. 12The Panel of Experts noted deficiencies in trade enforcement controls in Zimbabwe, including failure to prevent illegal exports of large com- mercial shipments of worked ivory, and showed there is no clear plan for use of ivory revenues to benefit elephant conservation. It also noted the existence of significant movement of ivory through the country. The United States has concerns about these reported deficiencies and about the adequacy of trade controls in the importing country. 13While acknowledging the excellent record of the government of South Africa in restoring populations of this species, the United States is concerned about potential detrimental effects of re-opening a legal international trade in rhinoceros horn. The United States has invested consid- erable effort into encouraging use of alternatives to rhinoceros horn derivatives in traditional Asian medicines. 14The proposal does not present sufficient biological information to justify the listing, uplisting, downlisting, or delisting as proposed, based on the criteria in Resolution Conf. 9.24. 15Transfer of the population of the Province of Jujuy and of the semicaptive populations of the Provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Catamarca, La Rioja, and San Juan, Argentina, from Appendix I to II, with an annotation to allow only the international trade in wool sheared from live vicu n\u00c4as, and in cloth and manufactured items made thereof, under the mark, ``VICUN A\u00c4A\u00b1ARGENTINA.'' 16Although the population may no longer meet the biological criteria for Appendix I, more detailed information on population inventory methods for wild herds and on management and transparency of the conservation fund are desirable in light of the precautionary measures of Annex 4 of Resolution Conf. 9.24. The proposal remains under review while the United States seeks clarification. 17Transfer of the populations of the Conservation Units of Mauri-Desaguadero, Ulla Ulla, and Lipez-Chicas, Bolivia, from Appendix I to II, with an annotation to allow only the international trade in cloth and manufactured items made thereof, under the mark, ``VICU N\u00c4\u00b1BOLIVIA.'' 18The proposal presents excellent population data and a well conceived approach to development of management plans and follow-through monitoring of the effectiveness of vicu n\u00c4a management in different socio-economic regimes. 19The United States sees no difficulties with such a change in the labeling of approved products.18737 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules 20Although the United States believes that trade in wood bison presently in captivity would have no negative impact on the wild population, the species, based on information in the proposal, still appears to meet the criteria for retention in Appendix I. The proposal remains under review, while the United States consults with Canada to obtain clarification on the species' status. 21The United States supports the exclusion from this proposal of introduced populations remote from the natural range, e.g., the introduced population of Australia. 22The species does not appear to be subject to international trade. 23Although trade is not recorded, the population is so small that retention in the Appendices would seem advisable as a precautionary meas- ure in the event illegal trade should ever occur. 24Because the subspecies are extremely similar and occur in the same jurisdiction, the proposed split-listing would be practically unenforce- able and would be inconsistent with Annex 3 of Resolution Conf. 9.24. 25Annotated to allow: (a) trade in current registered stocks of shell with one trading partner (Japan) that will not re-export; and b) export in one shipment per year, to the same partner, of shell marked in compliance with Resolution Conf. 5.16, which allows definitive identification of origin, from a traditional harvest (maximum 500 individuals per year) or from an experimental ranching program (anticipated: 50 individuals in the first year; 100 in the second year; and 300 in the third year). 26The transfer of certain populations of crocodilians from Appendix I to II is possible pursuant to Resolution Conf. 3.15, 5.16, and 8.22 (ranch- ing) and 9.24 (export quota). The United States is seeking information on whether (1) annual reports will be filed regularly with the CITES Sec- retariat by the proponent; (2) there is an adequate basis for monitoring the status of wild populations; (3) management plans provide for the re- turn of animals to the wild in numbers as appropriate; and (4) there is an implementable limit on the harvest of wild juveniles and adults. 27The United States believes the recommended language would clarify annotated downlistings, such as that of the South African population of the white rhinoceros, and eliminates the possibility of misinterpretation or abuse of the downlisting provisions. The United States looks forward to a detailed discussion of annotated downlistings from legal and technical perspectives at COP10. 28The current listing includes ``Roots and readily recognizable parts thereof''. The proposed revision is considered to be a minor change, which would clarify and keep the intent of the 1985 proposal (at COP5) to include whole roots and the larger parts thereof, and to exclude minor pieces and processed products. Some importing Parties have found that the current annotation can be interpreted too broadly. 29The United States will recommend standardization of the inclusion of the parts for Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng), Picrorhiza or rootstocks, and specimens recognizable as being parts thereof''. This would keep the intent of the proposal of Switzerland for Panax quinquefolius, and the intent of the proposals of India for the other two species, while accommodating those two species' different morphology of having rhizomes or rootstocks. 30This proposal is considered necessary to assist enforcement of Mexican law that regulates the export of seeds collected in the wild from cacti in Mexico. The Government of Mexico, at the November 1996 meeting of the CITES Plants Committee, presented information on recent violations of Mexican law and over-collection of cactus seeds of various taxa for export to various Party countries. The United States is discuss- ing with Mexico how they intend to administer the differentiation of seeds collected in the wild from seeds produced by artificial propagation in their Production Units (i.e., nurseries). We understand that this proposal only covers the populations of cacti in Mexico; it does not cover popu- lations of Mexican cacti native beyond Mexico, or specimens of Mexican cacti artificially propagated elsewhere than in Mexico. 31These two current listings include ``Saw-logs, sawn wood, and veneers''. The proposed revision is considered to be a minor change, which would correspond to the categories and definitions of HS codes 44.03 (logs), 44.06 and 44.07 (sawn wood), and 44.08 (veneer sheets) in the Harmonized System of the World Customs Organization. The change was recommended by the CITES Timber Working Group. 32There are so few individuals and populations of this species known in the wild, and so few artificially propagated individuals available in cul- tivation, that continued inclusion of the species in Appendix I is considered to be a needed precaution. 33The proposal for this species discusses its rhizomes or rootstocks rather than botanical roots. 34The proposal apparently seeks to establish a new standard exclusion for Appendix II taxa, but does not provide information to show that there presently is an unnecessary regulatory burden on a cut-flower trade in the listed Appendix II taxa (or actual complications in any trading of their hybrids with Appendix I taxa). Furthermore, the proposal did not address the taxa of Nepal in Appendix III, which also have their listings standardized with the current annotation #1. The conservation of species in the wild is considered to be better served with the present standard listing for Appendix II (and Appendix III), to which exceptions could be made if warranted in future proposals for particular taxa (as was done for the Orchidaceae or orchids). 35This proposal is considered to not include all taxa (or hybrids and cultivars) of Schlumbergera, but just those listed in detail in the proposal and in this F EDERALREGISTERnotice. 36The proposal stated that the artificially propagated grafting stocks are mostly specimens of Hylocereus species and Harrisia ``Jusbertii'', but these taxa (and any other cactus taxa that might be used as grafting stock) were not directly presented for similar exclusion. 37Although the stipulated taxa are artificially propagated extensively, the risk either to other taxa in the wild or to pertinent natural taxa needs further consideration. The burden for enforcement may be complicated rather than relieved by excluding these artificially propagated specimens. Nevertheless, minimizing or reducing regulation of artificially propagated specimens, when there is no risk to taxa in the wild, is a worthy goal. 38This proposal is considered not to include Euphorbia hermentiana, which we understand is not a synonym of Euphorbia trigona. Future Actions Prior to COP10, the Service will announce in the Federal Register its negotiating positions for COP10 on proposed amendments to the Appendices by foreign countries. In that notice the Service will solicit comments or recommendations on whether the United States should consider taking a reservation on any of the proposed amendments to the Appendices that are adopted by the Parties. Unless the United States enters a reservation by September 18, 1997, any amendments adopted by the Parties will become effective on that date. The Service will publish a notice of proposed rulemakingthat would implement such amendments. In addition to considering proposed amendments to the Appendices at COP10, the Parties may also consider certain recommendations by the Nomenclature Committee that seek to clarify the current listing status of certain species. A public meeting will be held on Friday, April 25, 1997 from 10:00\u00d01:00 at the Department of the Interior: Room 7000, 18th and C Street, NW, Washington, DC. Please note that this room is accessible to the handicapped. This meeting will provide the public an opportunity to comment on U.S. positions leading up to COP10. In addition to foreign species proposals,the Service will be prepared to discuss U.S. positions on the Agenda for COP10, resolutions submitted by other countries, and any other item of interest to the public in relation to CITES COP10.

Type of Revision of a currently approved collection. Abstract: The FCS\u00b1380\u00b11 is currently an integrated review schedule that was jointly developed by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), and the Food and Consumer Service (FCS). It was designed to collect both quality control (QC) data and case characteristics as well as serving as the comprehensive data entry form for all QC reviews in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Food Stamp (FS) and Medicaid programs. With the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104\u00b1193), the AFDC program is being replaced by the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. Under TANF, ACF will no longer be collecting QC data and will cease participating in the integrated QC system as of Fiscal Year 1998. HCFA ceased participation in the integrated QC system in mid 1996. Because of these changes, the current FCS\u00b1380\u00b11 is being revised to only collect food stamp data. Affected Public: Individuals or households; State or local governments. Estimated Number of Respondents: 57,236. Estimated Time per Response: 1.05 Hours. Estimated Total Annual Burden: 61,499.

The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on April 7, 1997. The refinery complex (1,294 acres, 550 employees) consists of 2 sites in18740 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices Will County, Illinois: Site 1 (1,200 acres)\u00d0refinery complex located at I\u00b155 and Arsenal Road, on the Des Plaines River, 8 miles south of Joliet, some 50 miles southwest of Chicago; Site 2 (94 acres)\u00d0Mokena storage facility (780,000 barrel capacity) located at 183rd St and Wolf Road, some 25 miles southwest of Chicago. The refinery (210,000 BPD) is used to produce fuels and petrochemical feedstocks. Fuel products include include gasoline, jet fuel, distillates, residual fuels, naphthas and motor fuel blendstocks. Petrochemical feedstocks and refinery by-products include methane, ethane, propane, propylene, butane, butadiene, benzene, toluene, xylene, petroleum coke, carbon black oil and sulfur. Some 3.6 percent of the crude oil (90 percent of inputs), and some motor fuel blendstocks are sourced abroad. Zone procedures would exempt the refinery from Customs duty payments on the foreign products used in its exports. On domestic sales, the company would be able to choose the Customs duty rates that apply to certain petrochemical feedstocks and refinery by-products (duty-free) by admitting incoming foreign crude oil and natural gas condensate in non-privileged foreign status. The duty rates on inputs range from 5.25 \u00a2 barrel to 10.5 \u00a2 barrel. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the refinery's international competitiveness. In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is June 16, 1997. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to July 1, 1997).

Scope of Order The products covered by this order are brake rotors made of gray cast iron, whether finished, semifinished, or unfinished, ranging in diameter from 8 to 16 inches (20.32 to 40.64 centimeters) and in weight from 8 to 45 pounds (3.63 to 20.41 kilograms). The size parameters (weight and dimension) of the brake rotors limit their use to the following types of motor vehicles: automobiles, all-terrain vehicles, vans and recreational vehicles under ``one ton and a half,'' and light trucks designated as ``one ton and a half.'' Finished brake rotors are those that are ready for sale and installation without any further operations. Semi- finished rotors are those on which the surface is not entirely smooth, and has undergone some drilling. Unfinished rotors are those which have undergone some grinding or turning. These brake rotors are for motor vehicles, and do not contain in the casting a logo of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) which produces vehicles sold in the United States (e.g., General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Honda, Toyota, Volvo). Brake rotors covered in this investigation are not certified by OEM producers of vehicles sold in the United States.

The Department subsequently amended its final determination to correct clerical errors made in the final determination (62 FR 15655, April 2, 1997). On April 9, 1997, the International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department of its final determination, pursuant to section 735(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, that the brake rotors industry in the United States is materially injured byreason of imports of the subject merchandise from the PRC.1 In accordance with section 736(a)(1) of the Act, we will direct the Customs Service to assess, upon further advice by the administering authority, antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise for all relevant entries of brake rotors from the PRC, except for imports of brake rotors from the PRC made by the following exporter/ producer combinations, which are excluded from the order by virtue of having received zero or de minimis rates in the antidumping duty investigation: Exporter(s) Producer(s) China National Automotive Industry Import & Export or Shandong Laizhou CAPCO Industry (Laizhou CAPCO) .Laizhou CAPCO. Honbase Ltd. (Shenyang) or Lai Zhou Luyuan Automobile Fittings Co., Ltd. (Laizhou) .Shenyang or Laizhou. China National Machinery and Equipment Import & Export (Xinjiang) Corporation, Ltd. (Xinjiang) .Zibo Botai Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Zibo). Accordingly, all bonds may be released and entries of these exporters may be liquidated without regard to antidumping duties. However, if any of the above-referenced exporters sells subject merchandise which is not manufactured by the producer(s) noted above with respect to those exporters,then those entries will be subject to the ``China-wide'' rate. For all other exporters, including non- exporter producers listed above should they later export directly, Customs officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties on this merchandise, acash deposit equal to the estimated weighted-average antidumping duty margins as noted below. The ``China- wide'' rate applies to all exporters of brake rotors not specifically listed below.

On April 9, 1997, the ITC notified the Department of its negative determination regarding critical circumstances. As a result of the ITC's determination, pursuant to section 735(c)(3) of the Act, we shall order Customs to terminate the retroactive suspension of liquidation and to release any bond or other security and refundany cash deposit required under section 733(e)(2) with respect to entries of subject merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption prior to October 10, 1996, which is the date of publication of the preliminary determination. This notice constitutes the antidumping duty order with respect tobrake rotors from the PRC. The Department is excluding from the application of the order products from the PRC that are manufactured and sold to the United States by the PRC exporter/manufacturer combinations noted above; however, the ad valorem weighted-average dumping margin applicable to brake rotors manufactured18742 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices by any other PRC manufacturers and exported by any of these companies is 43.32 percent (the PRC-wide rate).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Background On January 31, 1997, we received a timely request from the petitioners, (the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers; International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine & Furniture Workers, the AFL-CIO; and the Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO) to conduct an administrative review of sales by Mitsubishi Electronics Industries Inc. (Mitsubishi) subject to the antidumping duty order on color picture tubes from Japan. No other interested party requested an administrative review of this order. On March 3, 1997, we published in the Federal Register (62 FR 9413) the notice of initiation of administrative review for the period January 1, 1996 through December 31, 1996. Termination of Review On March 31, 1997, we received a timely request for withdrawal of the request for administrative review from the petitioners. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5) of the Department's regulations, the Department may allow a party that requests an administrative review to withdraw such request not later than 90 days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the administrative review. Because petitioners' request for withdrawal was submitted within the 90-day time limit and there were no requests for review from other interested parties, we are terminating this review. This notice serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility concerning disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with section 353.34(d) of the Department's regulations.

ACTION: Notice of amended final results of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: On January 7, 1997, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on dynamic random access memory semiconductors (DRAMs) from the Republic of Korea (62 FR 964). Subsequent to the publication of these final results, the petitioner, Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) filed suit with the Court of International Trade (CIT) with respect to the Department's methodology used in calculating the dumping margin of one respondent, LG Semicon Co., Ltd. (LGS). No suit was filed by any parties to this proceeding with respect to the dumping calculations pertaining to the other respondent in this review, Hyundai Electronics Industries, Co., Ltd. (Hyundai). We have corrected two ministerial errors with respect to sales of subject merchandise by Hyundai. The errors were present in our final results of review. The review covers the period May 1, 1994, through April 30, 1995. We are publishing this amendment to the final results of review in accordance with 19 CFR 353.28(c). EFFECTIVE DATE : April 17, 1997.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Background The review covers two manufacturers/ exporters of DRAMs from the Republic of Korea (Korea): Hyundai and LGS, and the period May 1, 1994 through April 30, 1995. The Department published the preliminary results of review on July 9, 1996 (61 FR 36029), and the final results of review on January 7, 1997 (62 FR 964).18743 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices Applicable Statute and Regulations Unless otherwise indicated, all citations to the statute are references to the provisions effective January 1, 1995, the effective date of the amendments made to the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Act) by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA). In addition, unless otherwise indicated, all citations to the Department's regulations are to the current regulations, as amended by the interim regulations published in the Federal Register on May 11, 1995 (60 FR 25130). Scope of Review Imports covered by the review are shipments of DRAMs of one megabit and above from the Republic of Korea (Korea). For purposes of this review, DRAMs are all one megabit and above, whether assembled or unassembled. Assembled DRAMs include all package types. Unassembled DRAMs include processed wafers, uncut die and cut die. Processed wafers produced in Korea, but packaged, or assembled into memory modules in a third country, are included in the scope; wafers produced in a third country and assembled or packaged in Korea are not included in the scope of this review. The scope of this review includes memory modules. A memory module is a collection of DRAMs, the sole function of which is memory. Modules include single in-line processing modules (SIPs), single in-line memory modules (SIMMs), or other collections of DRAMs, whether unmounted or mounted on a circuit board. Modules that contain other parts that are needed to support the function of memory are covered. Only those modules which contain additional items which alter the function of the module to something other than memory, such as video graphics adapter (VGA) boards and cards, are not included in the scope. The scope of this review also includes video random access memory semiconductors (VRAMs), as well as any future packaging and assembling of DRAMs. The scope of this review also includes removable memory modules placed on motherboards, with or without a central processing unit (CPU), unless the importer of motherboards certifies with the Customs Service that neither it, nor a party related to it or under contract to it, will remove the modules from the motherboards after importation. The scope of this review does not include DRAMs or memory modules that are reimported for repair or replacement. The DRAMs subject to this review are classifiable under subheadings8542.11.0001, 8542.11.0024, 8542.11.0026, and 8542.11.0034 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Also included in the scope are those removable Korean DRAMs contained on or within products classifiable under subheadings 8471.91.0000 and 8473.30.4000 of the HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, the written description of the scope of this review remains dispositive. The period of review (POR) covers from May 1, 1994 through April 30, 1995 for all respondents. Ministerial Errors in Final Results of Review After reviewing allegations of ministerial errors submitted by Hyundai, the Department determined that it should correct two clerical errors pertaining to Hyundai. The Department corrected the following clerical errors in the final results pertaining to Hyundai: In the margin calculations in the final results of review, we did not correctly revise our final calculations to correct for double counted interest expense in our preliminary calculation of CEP profit. To correct this double counting of interest expense, we intended to deduct U.S. credit expense from total U.S. expenses, but instead inadvertently added U.S. credit expense to Hyundai's U.S. direct selling expenses. We also inadvertently deducted Korean inventory carrying costs from U.S. price. We corrected the final calculations by deducting U.S. credit expense and not Korean inventory carrying costs from U.S. price (see memorandum Dynamic Random Access Memory Semiconductors (DRAMs) from the Republic of Korea (A\u00b1580\u00b1812); Second Administrative Review\u00d0Clerical Errors in the Final Results of Review ). Amended Final Results of Review Upon correction of the ministerial errors listed above, the Department has determined that the following margin exists for the periods indicated: Manufacturer/exporterPercent margin May 1, 1994 through April 30, 1995: Hyundai Electronics Industries ....0.09 The Customs Service shall assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions concerning eachrespondent directly to the U.S. Customs Service. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of these final results of administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for Hyundai will be zero percent; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or in the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) if neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review conducted by the Department, the cash deposit rate will be 3.85%, the all others rate established in the LTFV investigation. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), formerly a respondent in this administrative review, was excluded from the antidumping duty order on DRAMs from Korea on February 8, 1996. See Final Court Decision and Partial Amended Final Determination: Dynamic Random Access Memory Semiconductors of One Megabit and Above From the Republic of Korea , 61 FR 4765 (February 8, 1996). These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice serves as the final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of the APO is a sanctionable violation.18744 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22.

ACTION: Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review; certain hot-rolled lead and bismuth carbon steel products from the United Kingdom. SUMMARY: On December 10, 1996, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain hot-rolled lead and bismuth carbon steel products from the United Kingdom. The review covers one manufacturer/ exporter and the period March 1, 1995 through February 29, 1996. We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on our preliminary results. Based on our analysis of the comments received, and the correction of certain clerical errors, we have changed the results from those presented in the preliminary results of review.

Applicable Statute Unless otherwise indicated, all citations to the statute are references to the provisions effective January 1, 1995, the effective date of the amendments made to the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Act) by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA). In addition, unless otherwise indicated, all citations to theDepartment's regulations are to the current regulations, as amended by the interim regulations published in the Federal Register on May 11, 1995 (60 FR 25130). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Background On December 10, 1996, the Department published in the Federal Register (61 FR 65022) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain hot-rolled lead and bismuth carbon steel products from the United Kingdom (58 FR 15324, March 22, 1993). The Department has now completed the review in accordance with section 751 of the Act. Scope of the Review The products covered by this review are hot-rolled bars and rods of nonalloy or other alloy steel, whether or not descaled, containing by weight 0.03 percent or more of lead or 0.05 percent or more of bismuth, in coils or cut lengths, and in numerous shapes and sizes. Excluded from the scope of this review are other alloy steels (as defined by the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) Chapter 72, note 1(f)), except steels classified as other alloy steels by reason of containing by weight 0.4 percent or more of lead, or 0.1 percent or more of bismuth, tellurium, or selenium. Also excluded are semi-finished steels and flat-rolled products. Most of the products covered in this review are provided for under subheadings 7213.20.00 and 7214.30.00.00 of the HTSUS. Small quantities of these products may also enter the United States under the provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description of the scope of this order remains dispositive. This review covers one manufacturer/ exporter of certain hot-rolled lead and bismuth steel products, British Steel Engineering Steels limited (BSES), formerly United Engineering Steels Limited (UES), and the period March 1, 1995 through February 29, 1996. Duty Absorption As part of this review, we are considering, in accordance with section 751(a)(4) of the Act, whether BSES absorbed antidumping duties. See the preliminary results of this review (61 FR 65022, December 10, 1996). For thesefinal results of review, we find that antidumping duties have been absorbed by BSES. For a further discussion of this issue, see comments 1 and 2 below. Analysis of the Comments Received We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results of review. We received comments and rebuttal comments from the petitioner, Inland Steel Bar Co., and BSES. Comment 1: BSES contends that the Department lacks the authority to conduct a duty absorption inquiry in this, the third administrative review of this case, because the Act only permits such inquiries to be made in the second and fourth administrative reviews after the order is published. Petitioner maintains that the Department was correct in conducting this duty absorption inquiry. Petitioner contends that BSES ignores the fact that, because this order was in effect on January 1, 1995, it is a transition order under the Act. Petitioner argues that the issue date for transition orders, as prescribed by the Act for the interpretation of sunset-related deadlines, is not the date of the original Federal Register publication, but rather the effective date of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement, January 1, 1995. As support for its argument, petitioner cites the URAA, Statement of Administrative Action (SAA) in H.R. Doc. No. 316, 103d Cong., 2nd Sess. (1994) at 882. Petitioner also contends that section 351.213(j) of the Department's proposed antidumping regulations follows this timing interpretation and provides that for transition orders, if requested, the Department will make an absorption inquiry for administrative reviews initiated in 1996. According to petitioner, the preamble to the proposed antidumping regulations states explicitly that, for transition orders, ``reviews initiated in 1996 will be considered initiated in the second year and reviews initiated in 1998 will be considered initiated in the fourth year.'' Department's Position: We disagree with BSES that the Department lacks the authority to conduct a duty absorption inquiry in this review. Because the order for the subject merchandise was in existence as of the date the WTO agreement entered into force with respect to the United States, it is deemed to be a transition order. See section 751(c)(6)(C) of the Act. See also the SAA at 882. With respect to transition orders, section 351.213(j)(2) of the Department's proposed antidumping regulations explains that the Department will conduct a duty18745 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices absorption inquiry, if requested, beginning in the second year of review of such orders. See 61 FR 7307, 7366 (February 27, 1996). The preamble to the proposed antidumping regulations states that, for transition orders, ``reviews initiated in 1996 will be considered initiated in the second year and reviews initiated in 1998 will be considered initiated in the fourth year.'' 61 FR at 7317. (Although these proposed antidumping regulations are not yet binding upon the Department, they do constitute a public statement of how the Department expects to proceed in construing section 751(a)(4) of the amended statute. Because this review was initiated in 1996, the Department's duty absorption is deemed to be undertaken in the second year of review.) Comment 2: BSES maintains that, if the Department declines to terminate the absorption inquiry, it must find that BSES has not absorbed antidumping duties. BSES further maintains that the existence of dumping margins does not necessarily mean that duty absorption has occurred. If this were the case, then the Department's obligation to conduct an absorption review would be meaningless, and there would be no need for a separate inquiry by the Department and the International Trade Commission (ITC). BSES further maintains that the question of liability for antidumping duties is fundamentally different from the question of absorption in that the absorption inquiry involves at least two very distinct concepts that differentiate it from the ordinary dumping analysis. First, the absorption inquiry is intended to provide information to the ITC for consideration in a future sunset review. See sections 751(a)(4) and 752(a)(1)(D) of the Act. Secondly, BSES maintains that the Department should recognize that the small dumping margins that BSES has not yet succeeded in eliminating are not evidence of absorption. BSES contends that, in determining whether a respondent's pricing policies demonstrate an intent to pass on or absorb duties, the Department may and should consider a respondent's sales prices in the aggregate and thus should offset the sale-specific dumping margins found in the review by the negative margins found in the review. BSES notes that the Department's preliminary review results found that BSES had a very low dumping margin and argues that the Department should recognize that BSES's pattern of pricing shows that it has conscientiously raised its prices and reduced its margin and thus has not absorbed antidumping duties.BSES recognizes the Department's traditional methodology of setting negative dumping margins at zero in the calculation of the weighted-average dumping margin, but argues that there is no policy reason to ignore negative margins in duty absorption inquiries, and that there certainly is no such requirement in the statute or regulations. Petitioner maintains that, during the debates over the URAA, the domestic industry pointed out that the full remedial impact of dumping duties was not always reflected in the marketplace. Petitioner argues that, although 19 CFR 353.26 (1994) prohibited an exporter from reimbursing an importer of record for antidumping duties, nothing prohibited a respondent from acting as an importer of record, and thereby absorbing underpayment of duties. As a result, Congress amended the statute to direct the Department to identify these instances of duty absorption because they could be relevant in the Commission's sunset review determination on the likelihood of continuing or recurring material injury if an antidumping order is revoked. Department's Position: We disagree with BSES. An investigation as to whether there is duty absorption does not simply involve reading the margin of the final results. As the Department noted in the preliminary results of this review, the determination that duty absorption exists is also based on the lack of any information on the record that the first unrelated customer will be responsible for paying the duty that is ultimately assessed. Absent such an irrevocable agreement between the affiliated U.S. respondent and the first unrelated customer, there is no basis for the Department to conclude that the duty attributable to the margin is not being absorbed by the respondent. This is an instance where the existence of a margin raises an initial presumption that the respondent is, in fact, absorbing the duty. As such, the burden of producing evidence to the contrary shifts to the respondent. See Creswell Trading Co., Inc. v. United States, 15 F.3d 1054 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Here, the respondent has failed to place evidence on the record in support of its position that it is not absorbing the duties. Further, while the fact that respondent's margin has fallen indicates that the level of dumping has decreased, it does not indicate the absence of duty absorption in this review period, as there is still a positive margin. We disagree with BSES that negative and positive margins should be aggregated. The Department treats so- called ``negative'' margins as beingequal to zero in calculating a weighted- average margin because otherwise exporters would be able to mask their dumped sales with non-dumped sales. See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Professional Electric Cutting Tools and Professional Electric Sanding/Grinding Tools from Japan, 58 FR 30149 (May 26, 1993). It would be inconsistent on one hand to calculate margins using positive margin sales, which is the Department's practice, and then argue, in effect, that there are no margins because credit should be given for nonmargin sales. Thus, those sales which are used to determine whether there are margins should also be used to determine whether there is duty absorption. Whether or not respondents ``intended'' to absorb duties is also irrelevant to the Department's inquiry. The Act does not provide a basis for the Department to render judgements on the intentions of respondents, but instead to make an empirical finding as to whether absorption is occurring. Comment 3: Petitioner claims that some grades of scrap purchased by BSES from its affiliated parties were not at arm's-length transaction prices. If the scrap price from BSES's affiliated supplier is less than the scrap price from its unaffiliated supplier, petitioner claims, it is not an arm's-length transaction. To account for such grades that were not at arm's-length prices, petitioner maintains that the Department should increase BSES's total cost of production by the difference between the price paid to affiliated parties and the price paid to unaffiliated parties. Petitioner contends that the overall average for all grades of scrap does not recognize that individual grades of scrap may not have been purchased from affiliated parties in an arm's-length transaction. As support for its argument, petitioner cites 19 U.S.C.A. 1677b(f)(2) (1996 Supp.); also, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Dynamic Random Access Memory Semiconductors of One Megabit or Above From the Republic of Korea, 61 FR 20216, 20221 (May 6, 1996); Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Tapered Roller Bearings, Four Inches or Less in Outside Diameter, and Certain Components Thereof, from Japan, 56 FR 65228, 65237 (December 16, 1991); and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Certain Granite Products From Italy, 53 FR 27187, 27193 (July 19, 1988). BSES contends that scrap is not a uniform commodity with a single, stable, established price. The market is18746 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices volatile, with prices varying from period to period and from supplier to supplier. BSES claims that each month it and its suppliers assess the market and negotiate the price for each grade of scrap to be purchased in the coming month. The relationship does not affect the negotiated price. BSES further claims that both affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers sell to BSES in a tight cluster of prices that hover closely to theoretical market price, which sometimes is slightly higher than the average and sometimes slightly lower, but always dictated by the going market price. BSES notes that, out of 21 grades supplied by both affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers, affiliated suppliers' average prices were higher for 12 of these grades and unaffiliated suppliers higher for 9 grades. BSES maintains that the affiliated scrap prices for many of the grades are understated, since its most important affiliated suppliers do not include freight to BSES's location in their prices while the unaffiliated suppliers sell on a delivered basis. BSES notes that, where scrap sales were made on an ex-factory basis, BSES included its freight expense in the material cost used in the reporting of the cost of production and constructed value (CV). BSES claims that petitioner has distorted its scrap data, to conclude that the data show affiliated prices to be generally lower than unaffiliated prices. Department's Position: We agree with BSES that scrap purchases from affiliated suppliers were made at arm's- length prices, and that therefore no adjustment to scrap prices is warranted. As BSES notes, the overall weighted- average price for all grades of scrap during the fiscal year is somewhat higher from affiliated suppliers than from unaffiliated suppliers. See memorandum to the file from Leon McNeill, April 9, 1997. Comment 4: Petitioner argues that, for the upcoming administrative review, the Department should require respondent to allocate each individual rebate over only those sales benefitting from the rebate rather than over all sales. BSES contends that no changes should be made to the Department's analysis in either this review or future reviews. Department's Position: Since this comment refers to an upcoming administrative review of this order, it is not relevant to this review. Therefore, for these final results, the Department has not taken any action on this issue. Comment 5: BSES argues that the Department failed to make a circumstance-of-sale (COS) adjustment for home market imputed credit expenses for CV comparisons. BSESnotes that, in the preliminary results, the Department added imputed U.S. credit expenses to the foreign unit prices in dollars (FUPDOL). However, it failed to make a corresponding adjustment for home market credit expenses by subtracting such expenses from the CV. BSES suggests that the Department make this correction by calculating separately a weighted- average imputed home market credit expense in addition to the total actual direct selling expenses, and then deducting the weighted average home market credit expenses from CV. BSES maintains that the Department's normal value calculation methodology recognizes that home market price includes all cost and expenses, including imputed credit expense, since the Department makes a COS adjustment for this expense in price-to- price comparisons. Similarly, a COS adjustment is also required for CV, since imputed credit expenses are included in CV. BSES cites section 773(e) of the Act, which directs the Department to calculate CV as the sum of actual expenses incurred in the manufacture of the product sold in the United States, plus the actual selling expenses from the home market sales file, plus general and administrative expenses (including net interest expense), plus the actual profit realized on home market sales. BSES argues that since the Department added imputed U.S. credit to the FUPDOL, to ensure a fair comparison it must correspondingly deduct home market credit from CV. BSES contends that the Department's Office of Accounting has endorsed the methodology and it is also reflected in the following cases: Final Results of Administrative Review: Certain Welded Carbon Steel Pipe and Tube from Turkey, 61 FR 69067 (December 31, 1996) and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Large Newspaper Printing Presses from Japan (LNPPs from Japan), 61 FR 38139, 38147\u00b148 (July 23, 1996). Petitioner argues that since the Department did not include home market imputed credit in CV, it is not appropriate to deduct a home market credit expense from CV. Petitioner notes that although the Department has reached the opposite conclusion in several recent cases, including LNPPs from Japan, as cited by BSES, it should apply the pre-URAA policy of adjusting CV for imputed credit expenses. Department's Position: We agree with BSES that a COS adjustment should be made for home market imputed credit expenses in CV comparisons. Under the URAA, for both COP and CV, the statute provides that selling, general andadministrative expenses be based on actual amounts incurred by the exporter for production and sale of the foreign like product. Consistent with section 773(a)(6) of the Act, adjustments to normal value are appropriate where CV is the basis of normal value. The Department uses imputed credit expenses to measure the effect of a specific respondent's selling practices in the United States and the comparison market. See Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and the United Kingdom; Final Results of Administrative Reviews, 62 FR 2119\u00b120 (January 15, 1997). Because export price is the basis for United States price in this review, the adjustment entails adding U.S. imputed credit to the CV, and subtracting home market imputed credit from the CV. The U.S. imputed credit was added for the preliminary results; for these final results, we have also subtracted the home market imputed credit. See section 773(a)(6)(c)(iii) of the Act. Comment 6: BSES contends that the Department inadvertently deducted the home market quantity adjustment twice at lines 149 and 321 of the preliminary margin program. Department's Position: We agree with BSES and have revised our computer programming language accordingly for these final results of review. Comment 7: BSES argues that the Department erroneously applied a conversion factor to U.S. credit insurance. BSES claims that, since U.S. credit insurance is denominated in U.S. dollars, applying the conversion factor is incorrect. Department's Position: We agree with BSES and have revised our computer programming language accordingly for these final results of review. Comment 8: BSES maintains that the Department erred in converting U.S. packing from pounds sterling to U.S. dollars twice in calculating the FUPDOL for both price-to-price and CV comparisons. Department's Position: We agree with BSES and have revised our computer programming language accordingly for these final results. Comment 9: BSES claims that the Department misspelled the commission offset variable in the preliminary margin program. As a result, the commission offset was not applied to the FUPDOL for price-to-price comparisons where the U.S. commissions are greater than or equal to the home market indirect selling expenses. Department's Position: We agree with BSES, and have revised our computer18747 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices programming language accordingly for these final results. Comment 10: Petitioner argues that the Department inadvertently used the field MONTHU to establish the year for a concordance entry. Department's Position: We agree with petitioner. Accordingly, for these final results, we have revised our computerprogramming language to make the appropriate clerical error correction. Correction of Clerical Error For the preliminary results, we failed to include direct selling expenses, indirect selling expenses, and U.S. packing expenses in the amount by which the profit ratio was multiplied incalculating CV profit. For these final results, we have included these expenses in the calculation of CV profit. Final Results of Review As a result of our review, we determine that the following weighted- average margin exists: Manufacturer/exporter Period of reviewMargin (per- cent) British Steel Engineering Steels Limited (BSES)(formerly United Engineering Steels Limited) ................................. 3/1/95\u00b12/29/96 4.56 The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between export price and normal value may vary from the percentage stated above. Because there is a concurrent review of the countervailing duty order on the subject merchandise, final assessments for BSES will reflect the final results of the countervailing duty administrative review in accordance with 19 CFR 353.41(d)(iv). The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results of review for all shipments of certain hot-rolled lead and bismuth carbon steel products from the United Kingdom entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be the rate listed above; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) for all other producers and/or exporters of this merchandise, the cash deposit rate shall be 25.82 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the LTFV investigation (58 FR 6207, January 27, 1993). These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement ofantidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. Notification to Interested Parties This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: April 9, 1997. Robert S.

ACTION: Notice of rescission of antidumping duty administrative review.SUMMARY: On September 17, 1996, the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') published in the Federal Register (61 FR 48882) a notice announcing the initiation of an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on oil country tubular goods (``OCTG'') from Argentina. This review covered the period June 29, 1995 through July 31, 1996 (for OCTG other than drill pipe) and August 11, 1995 through July 31, 1996 (for drill pipe). This review has now been rescinded as a result of the absence of entries into the United States of subject merchandise during the period of review. EFFECTIVE DATE : April 17, 1997.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : On August 30, 1996, petitioners requested an administrative review of Siderca S.A.I.C., an Argentine producer and exporter of OCTG, and Siderca Corporation, a U.S. importer and reseller of such merchandise (collectively, ``Siderca''), with respect to the antidumping duty order published in the Federal Register on August 11, 1995 (60 FR 41055). We initiated this review on September 17, 1996 (61 FR 48882). On October 4, 1996, Siderca filed a letter with the Department certifying that it did not export, directly or indirectly, subject merchandise that was entered for consumption into the United States during the period of review (``POR''). Siderca also certified that its U.S. affiliate, Siderca Corporation, did not import for U.S. consumption any of the subject merchandise during the POR.18748 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices On October 25, 1996, petitioners claimed that publicly available import data contradicted Siderca's claims. Petitioners contended these data showed that Siderca was the shipper of a substantial quantity of OCTG (drill pipe and green tubing) during the period August through December, 1995, and that Siderca was listed as the consignee of each entry. Petitioners noted that none of these entries appeared in official U.S. import statistics. Petitioners also claimed those statistics showed that a very small quantity of seamless casing entered the United States from Argentina in December 1995, and requested that Siderca be asked to explain the exact nature, timing, and details of this shipment. On October 30, 1996, we sent a no- shipment inquiry regarding Siderca to the U.S. Customs Service (``Customs''). Customs did not indicate that there were records of any consumption entries of OCTG by Siderca during the POR. On November 13, 1996, Siderca asserted in a letter to the Department that none of the six entries of drill pipe and green tubing referenced by petitioners was a consumption entry; rather, Siderca claimed, two of these entries were temporary importation in- bond (``TIB'') entries and four were entries into a foreign-trade zone (``FTZ''). Siderca argued that none of these entries could serve as the basis for an administrative review since they were not imported into the United States for consumption. Siderca also stated that it had no knowledge of, or involvement with, the very small shipment of seamless casing that allegedly entered the United States in December 1995. Siderca surmised that this shipment involved parties other than itself. There is no evidence on the record that would lead us to question this claim by Siderca. On April 8, 1997, we received official confirmation from Customs that two of the entries of drill pipe and green tubing in question were TIB entries and that the remaining four were FTZ entries. Customs also confirmed that none of these six entries entered the customs territory of the United States during the POR for consumption. Because the only firm for which a review was requested made no entries into the customs territory of the United States during the POR, we are rescinding this review in accordance with the Department's practice. See Antidumping Duties; Countervailing 7317, 7365 (February 27, 1996) (section 351.213(d)(3)).

Scope of Order The merchandise covered by this order is all stock deformed steel concrete reinforcing bars sold in straight lengths and coils. This includes all hot- rolled deformed rebar rolled from billet steel, rail steel, axle steel, or low-alloy steel. It excludes (i) plain round rebar, (ii) rebar that a processor has further worked or fabricated, and (iii) all coated rebar. Deformed rebar is currently classifiable in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) under item numbers 7213.10.000 and 7214.20.000. The HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description of the scope of this order is dispositive. Antidumping Duty Order In accordance with section 735(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), the Department made its final determination that rebar from Turkey is being sold at less than fair value (62 FR 9737, March 4, 1997). On April 10, 1997, the International TradeCommission (ITC) notified the Department of its final determination, pursuant to section 735(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, that a regional industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports of the subject merchandise from Turkey. In accordance with section 736(a)(1) of the Act, the Department will direct Customs officers to assess, upon further advice by the administering authority, antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise for all entries of rebar from Turkey. These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of rebar from Turkey entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after October 10, 1996, the date on which the Department published its preliminary determination in the Federal Register (61 FR 53203). On or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , Customs officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties on this merchandise, a cash deposit equal to the estimated weighted-average antidumping duty margins as noted below. The ``All Others'' rate applies to all exporters of rebar not specifically listed below. The ad valorem weighted-average dumping margins are 16.06 In the final determination, the Department found that critical circumstances exist with respect to exports of rebar from Turkey by all exporters except Colakoglu. However, on April 10, 1997, the ITC notified the Department of its negative determination regarding critical circumstances. As a result of the ITC's determination, pursuant to section 735(c)(3) of the Act, we shall order Customs to terminate the retroactive suspension of liquidation and to release any bond or other security and refund18749 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices any cash deposit required under section 733(e)(2) of the Act with respect to entries of subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption prior to October 10, 1996.

ACTION: Notice of final results of countervailing duty administrative reviews. SUMMARY: On October 7, 1996, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register its preliminary results of administrative reviews of the countervailing duty orders on pure and alloy magnesium from Canada for the period January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994 (see Pure Magnesium and Alloy Magnesium From Canada; Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews (Preliminary Results), 61 FR 52435. We have completed these reviews and determine the net subsidy to be 4.48 percent ad valorem for Norsk Hydro Canada, Inc. (NHCI) and all other producers/exporters except Timminco Limited, which has been excluded from these orders. We will instruct the U.S.18750 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices Customs Service to assess countervailing duties as indicated above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Background Pursuant to 19 CFR 355.22(a), these reviews cover only those producers or exporters of the subject merchandise for which reviews were specifically requested. Accordingly, these reviews cover only NHCI, a producer of the subject merchandise which exported pure and alloy magnesium to the United States during the review period. On October 7, 1996, the Department published in the Federal Register the Preliminary Results of its administrative reviews of the countervailing duty orders on pure and alloy magnesium from Canada (61 FR 52435). We invited interested parties to comment on the Preliminary Results. On November 6 and 13, 1997, case briefs and rebuttals were submitted by NHCI, the Government of Qu e\u00c2bec (GOQ), and the Magnesium Corporation of America (petitioner). At the request of respondents, the Department held a public hearing on December 4, 1996. These reviews cover the period January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994. The reviews involve one company (NHCI) and the following programs: Exemption from Payment of Water Bills, Article 7 Grants from the Qu e\u00c2bec Industrial Development Corporation (SDI), St. Lawrence River Environment Technology Development Program, Program for Export Market Development, the Export Development Corporation, Canada-Qu e\u00c2bec Subsidiary Agreement on the Economic Development of the Regions of Qu e\u00c2bec, Opportunities to Stimulate Technology Programs, Development Assistance Program, Industrial Feasibility Study Assistance Program, Export Promotion Assistance Program, Creation of Scientific Jobs in Industries, Business Investment Assistance Program, Business Financing Program, Research and Innovation Activities Program, Export Assistance Program, Energy Technologies Development Program, and Transportation Research and Development Assistance Program.Applicable Statute Unless otherwise indicated, all citations to the statute are in reference to the provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) effective January 1, 1995 (the Act). The Department is conducting these administrative reviews in accordance with section 751(a) of the Act. Scopes of the Reviews The products covered by these reviews are shipments of pure and alloy magnesium from Canada. Pure magnesium contains at least 99.8 percent magnesium by weight and is sold in various slab and ingot forms and sizes. Magnesium alloys contain less than 99.8 percent magnesium by weight with magnesium being the largest metallic element in the alloy by weight, and are sold in various ingot and billet forms and sizes. Secondary and granular magnesium are not included in the scope of the orders. Pure and alloy magnesium are currently provided for in subheadings 8104.11.0000 and 8104.19.0000, respectively, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``HTS''). Although the HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. Secondary and granular magnesium are not included in the scopes of these orders. Our reasons for excluding granular magnesium are summarized in the Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Pure and Alloy Magnesium from Canada (57 FR 6094, February 20, 1992). Analysis of Programs Based upon our analysis of our questionnaire responses and written comments from the interested parties, we determine the following: I. Programs Conferring Subsidies A. Exemption from Payment of Water Bills In the preliminary results, we found that this program conferred countervailable benefits on the subject merchandise. Our analysis of the comments submitted by the interested parties, summarized below, has not led us to change our findings from the Preliminary Results. On this basis, the net subsidy rate for this program is as follows: Manufacturer/exporterRate (percent) NHCI......................................... 0.65B. Article 7 Grants from the Qu e\u00c2bec Industrial Development Corporation In the preliminary results, we found that this program conferred countervailable benefits on the subject merchandise. Our analysis of the comments submitted by the interested parties, summarized below, has not led us to change our findings from the Preliminary Results. On this basis, the net subsidy for this program is as follows: Manufacturer/exporterRate (percent) NHCI......................................... 3.83 II. Programs Found Not to be Used In the preliminary results, we found that the producers and/or exporters of the subject merchandise did not apply for or receive benefits under the following programs: St. Lawrence River Environment Technology Development Program. Program for Export Market Development. Export Development Corporation. Canada-Que \u00c2bec Subsidiary Agreement on the Economic Development of the Regions of Qu e\u00c2bec. Opportunities to Stimulate Technology Programs. Development Assistance Program. Industrial Feasibility Study Assistance Program. Export Promotion Assistance Program. Creation of Scientific Jobs in Industries. Business Investment Assistance Program. Business Financing Program. Research and Innovation Activities Program. Export Assistance Program. Energy Technologies Development Program. Transportation Research and Development Assistance Program. We received no comments on these programs from the interested parties; therefore, we have not changed our findings from the Preliminary Results. Analysis of Comments Comment 1: Countervailability of the Exemption from Payment of Water Bills Respondents argue that NHCI's contract with its supplier of water, La Societe \u00c2du Parc Industriel et Portuaire de Be \u00c2cancour (``Industrial Park''), was inextricably linked with the credit it received from the GOQ to offset its water bills. If the water credit had not been received, respondents state that a different billing arrangement would18751 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices have been made. Therefore, in determining the amount of the benefit conferred by the credit, the Department should look to what NHCI would have paid absent the water credit and the contract compared to what it paid with the credit and the contract. To calculate what NHCI would have paid absent the credit and the contract, respondents argue that the closest approximation is the amount NHCI would have paid under its present contract based on actual water consumption rather than forecasted consumption. Petitioner states that in these reviews and previous ones the Department has thoroughly analyzed the relevant issues with respect to NHCI's contract with the Industrial Park and has correctly calculated the countervailable benefit in the Preliminary Results. DOC Response We disagree with respondents that we are required to hypothesize what NHCI would have paid for its water in the absence of the credit and the contract it entered into to measure the benefit conferred by the credit. The position put forward by NHCI is analogous to a situation where a company received a low-interest loan from a government and argues to the Department that because of the low interest rate, it borrowed more than it otherwise would have. Therefore, the company would contend, to calculate the benefit conferred by the low-interest loan, the Department should compare the actual amount of interest paid on the low- interest loan with the amount of interest the company would have paid on a smaller loan at a higher benchmark interest rate. In this loan situation, we would not enter into a hypothetical calculation of what amount the company would have borrowed absent the low-interest loan. Instead, consistent with section 771(5)(A)(II)(c) of the Act, we would simply countervail the difference in the two interest rates without regard to what effect the interest rate has on the other terms of the loan, i.e., the amount borrowed. In these reviews, the terms of the contract between NHCI and the Industrial Park unambiguously state that NHCI is required to pay an amount based, in part, on forecasted consumption. To the extent the GOQ's provision of the credit relieved NHCI from paying its water bills, a countervailable benefit existed without regard to whether NHCI would have received different terms under an alternative arrangement. Therefore, we determine that the benefit is the full amount of the credit.Comment 2: Article 7 Assistance under the SDI Act Respondents argue that the Department improperly applied its grant methodology to the Article 7 assistance provided to NHCI. According to respondents, because NHCI knew it would receive interest rebates from SDI prior to taking out loans, the Department should calculate the benefit using its loan methodology and reduce the interest rate charged by the amount of the interest rebated. Respondents state that this would be consistent with the Department's methodology, citing a number of cases (e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; Certain Steel Products From the United Kingdom (UK Steel), 58 FR 37393, 37397 (July 9, 1993)). Respondents further contend that the Preliminary Results were based on significant errors of fact regarding the interest rebates received by NHCI. First, respondents argue that the relationship between the interest rebates and the underlying loans was not indirect. Second, the interest rebates received by NHCI reduced NHCI's costs of borrowing for the construction of its plant, not its costs of purchasing environmental equipment. With respect to the first point, respondents argue that the Department was incorrect in its assertion that the Article 7 assistance was more closely linked to the acquisition of certain assets than the accumulation of interest costs. Moreover, respondents maintain that the SDI assistance was not intended solely for the purchase of environmental protection equipment, but was also intended to facilitate the construction of NHCI's facility in Qu e\u00c2bec. The fact that the Article 7 assistance was intended to achieve more than one objective does not distinguish the Article 7 assistance from other interest rebate programs which the Department has treated under its loan methodology, according to respondents. With respect to the second point, respondents argue that since the Department wrongly assumed that the Article 7 assistance was provided solely for the purchase of environmental equipment, the Department was able to conclude that the interest rebates exceeded the interest that would be in connection with the purchase of the environmental equipment. Hence, the Department concluded that the Article 7 assistance should not be treated as an interest rebate. However, because the Article 7 assistance was intended to reduce the cost of financing for the project as a whole, the assistance wasnot excessive in the sense described by the Department. Petitioner agrees with the Department's treatment of the Article 7 benefits received by NHCI and emphasizes that in these reviews and in prior reviews the Department has addressed the germane issues regarding the Article 7 benefits. DOC Position The issue presented by this case is whether the Article 7 assistance received by NHCI should be treated as an interest rebate or as a grant. If it is treated as an interest rebate, then under the methodology adopted by the Department in the 1993 steel cases, the benefit of the Article 7 assistance would be countervailed according to our loan methodology (Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain Steel Products From Belgium, (Belgium Steel) 58 FR 37273, 37276, July 9, 1993). However, if treated as a grant, the benefits would be allocated over a period corresponding to the life of the company's assets. In their brief, respondents argue that the interest rebate methodology reflects the fact that companies face a choice between debt and equity financing. If a company knows that the government is willing to rebate interest charges before the company takes out a loan, the government is encouraging the company to borrow rather than sell equity. Hence, respondents conclude, the benefit should be measured with reference to the duration of the borrowing for which the rebate is provided. We disagree that the Department's interest rebate methodology was intended to reflect the choice between equity and loan financing. In the 1993 steel cases, (See, e.g., Belgium Steel ), we examined a particular type of subsidy, interest rebates, and determined which of our valuation methodologies was most appropriate. The possible choices were between the grant and loan methodologies. Where the company had knowledge prior to taking the loan out that it would receive an interest rebate, we decided that the loan methodology was most appropriate because there is virtually no difference between the government offering a loan at 5 percent interest (which would be countervailed according to the loan methodology) and offering to rebate half of the interest paid on a 10 percent loan from a commercial bank each time the company makes an interest payment. Hence, we were seeking the closest methodological fit for different types of interest rebates. However, the interest rebate methodology described in the 1993 steel18752 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices cases was never intended to dictate that the Department should apply the loan methodology in every situation in which a government makes contributions toward a company's interest obligations. The appropriate methodology depends on the nature of the subsidy. For example, assume that the government told a company that it would make all interest payments on all construction loans the company took out during the next year up to $6 million. This type of ``interest rebate'' operates essentially like a $6 million grant restricted to a specific purpose. Whether the purpose is to pay interest expenses or buy a piece of equipment does not change the nature of the subsidy. In contrast, the interest rebate methodology is appropriate for the type of interest rebate programs investigated in the 1993 steel cases, i.e., partial interest rebates paid over a period of years on particular long-term loans. As we did in the 1993 steel cases, the Department in these reviews is seeking the most appropriate methodology for the Article 7 assistance. We erred in our Preliminary Results of First Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews: Pure Magnesium and Alloy Magnesium from Canada, 61 FR 11186 (March 19, 1996), in stating that the primary purpose of the Article 7 assistance was to underwrite the purchase of environmental equipment. However, it cannot be disputed that the environmental equipment played a crucial role in the agreement between SDI and NHCI. Most importantly, the aggregate amount of assistance to be provided was determined by reference to the cost of environmental equipment to be purchased. In this respect, the Article 7 assistance is like a grant for capital equipment. Further, the assistance provided by SDI is distinguishable from the interest rebates addressed in the 1993 steel cases in that the interest payments in the steel cases rebated a portion of the interest paid on particular long-term loans. Here, although the disbursement of Article 7 assistance was contingent, inter alia, on NHCI making interest payments, the disbursements were not tied to the amount borrowed, the number of loans taken out or the interest rates charged on those loans. Instead, the disbursements were tied to NHCI meeting specific investment targets and generally to NHCI having incurred interest costs on borrowing related to the construction of its facility. Therefore, while we recognize that NHCI had to borrow and pay interest in order to receive individual disbursements of the Article 7 assistance, we do not agree that this factis dispositive of whether the interest rebate methodology used in the 1993 steel cases is appropriate. We believe this program more closely resembles the scenario described above where the government agrees to pay all interest incurred on construction loans taken out by a company over the next year up to a specified amount. Because, in this case, the amount of assistance is calculated by reference to capital equipment purchases (something extraneous to the interest on the loan) and the reimbursements do not relate to particular loans, we determine that the Article 7 assistance should be treated as a grant. The Department has in past cases classified subsidies according to their characteristics. For example, in the General Issues Appendix (GIA) appended to Final Countervailing Duty Determination; Certain Steel Products from Austria (58 FR 37063, 37226, July 9, 1993), we developed a hierarchy for determining whether so-called ``hybrid instruments'' should be countervailed according to our loan, grant or equity methodologies. In short, we were asking whether the details of particular government ``contributions'' made them more like a loan, a grant or an equity infusion. Similarly, when a company receives a grant, we look to the nature of the grant to determine whether the grant should be treated as recurring or non-recurring. In these reviews, we have undertaken the same type of analysis, i.e., determining an appropriate calculation methodology based on the nature of the subsidy in question. As with hybrid instruments and recurring/ non-recurring grants, it is appropriate to determine which methodology is most appropriate based on the specific facts of the Article 7 assistance. Although the Article 7 assistance exhibits characteristics of both an interest rebate and a grant, based on an overview of the contract under which the assistance was provided, we determine that the weight of the evidence in this case supports our treatment of the Article 7 assistance as a grant. Comment 3: Reexamination of Specificity of the Article 7 Assistance In the event the Department continues to treat the Article 7 assistance as a non- recurring grant, respondents state that the Department is obliged to make a finding that the Article 7 assistance conferred a subsidy to NHCI during the POR. The Department may not, as it has here, rely on a factual finding of disproportionality during a different time period and different amounts of assistance. Respondents state that a finding of de facto specificity requires acase-by-case analysis, citing PPG Industries, Inc. v. United States (928 F.2d 1568, 1577 (Fed.Cir. 1991)), Geneva Steel v. United States (914 F.Supp. 563, 598 (CIT 1996)), and Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain Steel Products from Brazil (58 FR 37295, 37303 (July 9, 1993)) to support their reasoning. Respondents also cite the sixth administrative review of Live Swine from Canada; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (Live Swine ) (59 FR 12243 (March 16, 1994)) as an example where the Department reexamined the countervailability of benefits found to be de facto specific in prior reviews. Respondents maintain that given the Department's responsibility to make a finding of specificity and countervailability based on the information relevant to the POR, the Department should consider any new assistance provided by SDI since the end of the original period of investigation. To this end, the GOQ provided information on the Article 7 assistance extended up to, and including, the POR in a submission dated April 4, 1996. The GOQ also provided information on assistance provided under Article 9 of the SDI Act in that same submission. According to the GOQ, assistance under Article 9 should be included in the Article 7 specificity analysis because Article 9 was the predecessor of Article 7 and the provisions of Article 9 functioned basically the same as those of Article 7. Respondents then present a methodology they believe should be employed whereby the Department would compare the portion of NHCI's original grant allocated to the POR, based on the Department's standard allocation methodology, and the portions of benefits allocated to the POR for all assistance bestowed to all other enterprises receiving SDI assistance under Articles 7 and 9 to determine whether NHCI received a disproportionate share of benefits. Petitioner concurs with the Department's decisions on this issue in these reviews and in prior segments of the proceedings. DOC Position It is the Department's policy not to revisit specificity determinations absent the presentation of new facts or evidence (see, e.g., Carbon Steel Wire Rod From Saudi Arabia; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review and Revocation of Countervailing Duty Order, 59 FR 58814, November 15, 1994). In these reviews, no new facts or evidence have18753 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices been presented which would lead us to question that determination. We address respondents' arguments in favor of making a POR-specific determination and the relevance of the information submitted for consideration below. POR-Specific Determinations Re: De Facto Specificity Respondents refer to the various reviews of the countervailing duty order on live swine from Canada as demonstrating that the Department has, as a matter of course, revisited its de facto specificity determinations from one segment of a proceeding to another. While distinct de facto specificity determinations were made with respect to the Tripartite program in the fourth, fifth and sixth reviews of the order on live swine from Canada, these were not done as a matter of course. The Department reexamined specificity in these reviews of live swine only as a result of an adverse decision by the Binational Panel. Because the Binational Panel overturned the Department's finding of specificity regarding the Tripartite program in the fourth review of live swine for lack of evidence (and eventually rejected its analysis regarding specificity in the fifth review but upheld its decision), the Department continued to collect information in the sixth review, which was running concurrently with the Binational proceedings. In explaining its actions in the sixth review, the Department recognized that it does not routinely revisit specificity determinations, as respondents would have us believe, in stating the following: Although our practice is not to reexamine a specificity determination (affirmative or negative) made in the investigation or in a review absent new facts or evidence of changed circumstances, the record in the prior reviews did not contain all of the information we consider necessary to define the agricultural universe in Canada. (See Live Swine .) As can be seen from the foregoing, the facts surrounding the live swine reviews do not correspond to the situation presented here. In particular, the issue of specificity had not been conclusively settled in the live swine reviews and was in the process of litigation, and different information was available; unlike this case in which a definitive specificity determination had already been established. As for respondents' arguments that de facto specificity determinations should be done on a case-by-case basis, we agree. However, we disagree with respondents as to what ``case-by-case'' means. In each of the citations respondents refer to, ``case'' referred not to a separate segment of the sameproceeding (e.g., the first review of an order distinct from the second review), but to a separate investigation or review of different products (e.g., an investigation of carbon black from Mexico as opposed to an investigation of steel products from Brazil). It is this latter definition of ``case'' we find to be the proper basis for examination of de facto specificity determinations. Since a separate de facto specificity determination was made in the investigations of pure and alloy magnesium, we find that the analysis was properly conducted. In proposing that the Department base a POR-specific de facto specificity finding on the portions of non-recurring grants allocated to the POR, the respondents appear to be confusing the initial specificity determination based on the action of the granting authority at the time of bestowal with the allocation of the benefit over time. These are two separate processes. The portions of grants allocated to periods of time using the Department's standard allocation methodology are irrelevant to an examination of the actual distribution of benefits by the granting government at the time of bestowal. Relevance Of Submitted Information As stated in the preceding section, the proper time period for a specificity determination is the time of bestowal. Therefore, information submitted by the GOQ on assistance provided subsequent to the time of bestowal of the assistance granted to NHCI under Article 7 of the SDI Act is not relevant to the specificity determination. The remaining information presented by the GOQ on the Article 7 assistance granted prior to and including the time of bestowal of NHCI's Article 7 benefits is nearly identical to that utilized by the Department in its original specificity determination. Differences between the updated information on Article 7 provided by the GOQ and information used in the original specificity determination are sufficiently small so as not to compromise the original specificity determination. As for the GOQ's argument that assistance under Article 9 should also be included in the specificity analysis, we note that the GOQ neither alleged that Articles 7 and 9 are integrally linked nor provided information which would allow us to make a determination on integral linkage. Information on the record in these proceedings with respect to Article 9 consists only of the following statement by the GOQ in its original response to the questionnaire: Article 7 replaced Article 9 of the SDI Act in 1986. Article 9 operated almost identicallyto Article 7. Article 9 assistance, like Article 7, required authorization by the Gouvernement du Que \u00c2bec. In order for the Department to treat two programs as one for purposes of its specificity analysis, it must be demonstrated that the two programs are integrally linked. When examining the issue of integral linkage, it has been the Department's practice to examine, among other things, the administration of the programs, evidence of a government policy to treat industries equally, the purposes of the programs as stated in their enabling legislation and the manner of funding the program ( see Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determination and Final Negative Critical Circumstances Determination: Certain Laminated Hardwood Trailer Flooring From Canada 62 FR 5201, 5210 (February 4, 1997)). As can be seen from the foregoing, the GOQ has failed to provide any evidence supporting its implicit claim that Articles 7 and 9 should be treated as one program. Since Articles 7 and 9 are separate programs, information submitted on Article 9 assistance does not call into question the original specificity determination regarding Article 7. Based on all of the arguments above, we find that the GOQ has not provided new information which would cause us to revisit our original specificity determination. As a result, the bases of the original specificity determination and the conclusions of that determination are still valid. We, therefore, maintain that assistance provided to NHCI under Article 7 of the SDI Act is specific and, therefore, countervailable. Comment 4: Appropriate Denominator Respondents state that in the Preliminary Results the Department deviated from its standard practice in determining the denominator for companies with multinational production facilities that fail to rebut the presumption that subsidies are domestically tied. In particular, respondents argue that it is the Department's policy to tie such subsidies to domestic operations, by allocating benefits to sales by the domestic company regardless of country of manufacture, as opposed to tying to domestic production, as was done in the Preliminary Results. Respondents additionally state that the Department both failed to explain its basis for presuming that the subsidies were tied to Canadian production and to respond to NHCI's arguments in favor of allocating the subsidies over sales by NHCI of subject merchandise regardless of country of manufacture. In so doing,18754 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices respondents claim the Department denied NHCI due process by preventing it from rebutting the presumption and from responding to the rationale the Department used to support its decision to tie the subsidies to domestic production. In support of their assertion that the subsidies NHCI received are tied to its domestic operations, respondents state that any funds received benefited all employment- related activities in Canada ( e.g., sales of all products) and that these activities are related to both domestic and foreign production. Respondents elaborate further that the denominator policy used by the Department in this case is a deviation from the fungibility of money principle. Respondents also cite British Steel plc v. United States (British Steel) (479 F. Supp. 1254, 1371) in which the Court reversed and remanded the Department's determinations because it found that the Department should have given plaintiffs due notice of its decision to apply the rebuttable presumption that the subsidies at issue were tied to domestic production in order to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to rebut the Department's presumption. Petitioner agrees with the Department's decisions and analyses of this issue in these reviews and in prior segments of these proceedings. DOC Response: Respondents cite British Steel in an attempt to imply that the Department must inform parties early during the course of each proceeding of its intent to use the rebuttable presumption that subsidies to companies with foreign manufacturing operations are tied to domestic production. However, the facts involved in British Steel are readily distinguishable. Therefore, the holding in that case does not apply to the present situation. In British Steel, the Court was examining the Department's policy of using the rebuttable presumption articulated in the GIA. In particular, the Court took issue with the introduction of the new policy in the final- determination stage of the investigation, because the timing prevented parties from both commenting on the methodology and from presenting evidence rebutting the presumption. It is important to note that the Department's remand determination, as affirmed by the Court, upheld the appropriateness of using the rebuttable presumption. The Department has continued to use the rebuttal presumption and this policy has become accepted Department practice. Unlike British Steel , we are not dealing with theintroduction of a new policy late into the course of a proceeding in this case. Therefore, the Department was not required to forewarn respondents of the use of the rebuttable presumption. We also note that the use of a denominator based only on domestically produced merchandise did not come as a surprise to respondents. To begin, in the original investigations of these cases (which pre-dated the rebuttable presumption) the Department used a denominator based only on sales of domestically produced merchandise (Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Pure Magnesium and Alloy Magnesium From Canada, 57 FR 30946 (July 13, 1992)). Since the investigations in these cases, there has been a changed circumstances review (57 FR 54047 (November 16, 1992)) and a Binational Panel proceeding. In all of the proceedings, the denominators have included only domestically produced merchandise and in no case have respondents objected to those denominators. In addition, the questionnaire for these reviews requested information on sales denominators based on domestically produced merchandise. NHCI provided the requested sales denominator information along with denominators based on total sales by NHCI and arguments why those based on total sales should be used. Moreover, sales of domestically produced merchandise were used as the denominator in the Preliminary Results. As can be seen from the foregoing, respondents were aware as to the possible use of a denominator based on domestically produced merchandise and did indeed have an opportunity to attempt to rebut the presumption. Respondents also argue that the Department must explain the basis of its presumption. However, the idea behind the use of a rebuttable presumption is that the fact presumed\u00d0in this case that subsidies bestowed on companies with foreign manufacturing operations are tied to domestic production\u00d0becomes the default position and does not have to be explained in each case. As the Department stated in the GIA, ``Thus, under the Department's refined ``tied'' analysis, the Department will begin by presuming that a subsidy provided by the government of the country under investigation is tied to domestic production'' (GIA at 37231). It follows that the Department will find that subsidies are tied to domestic production in the absence of evidence to the contrary. As for respondents' complaint that the Department failed to address its arguments that the subsidies received byNHCI benefited all of the company's operations, not just its manufacturing activities, we note that in the GIA it states, ``A party may rebut this presumption by presenting evidence tending to show that the subsidy was not tied to domestic production . . .'' The phrase, ``tending to show'' means that the party attempting to rebut the presumption must provide enough evidence to convince a reasonable fact- finder of the non-existence of the presumed fact\u00d0that subsidies are tied to the recipient firm's domestic production (Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Court Remand on General Issue of Sales Denominator: British Steel plc v. United States, Consol. Ct. No. 93\u00b1 09\u00b100550-CVD, Slip Op. 95\u00b117 and Order (CIT Feb. 9, 1995) at 17). The mere absence of evidence limiting the government's intended scope of the benefit to domestic production is not sufficient. In this case, respondents' arguments have not risen to the level of evidence that would convince us that the GOQ intended that the subsidies it bestowed on NHCI were to benefit more than just domestic production. Therefore, respondents have failed to rebut the presumption that the subsidies received by NHCI were tied to domestic production. The Department's methodology for determining what to include in the denominator when a company has foreign manufacturing operations is explained in the GIA: ``If we determine that the subsidy is tied to domestic production, we will allocate the benefit of the subsidy fully to sales of domestically produced merchandise'' [emphasis added] (GIA at 37231). This quotation makes it clear that sales of foreign-produced merchandise by a respondent company would not be included in the denominator. Even if we were to consider tying the subsidies at issue to domestic operations, using respondents' suggestion of a sales denominator based on total NHCI sales would be improper since such a figure would include sales of foreign-produced merchandise by NHCI and, therefore, value-added from operations in other countries. Based on the foregoing arguments, we have continued to allocate subsidies received by NHCI to the company's merchandise produced in Canada. Final Results of Review In accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(c)(4)(ii), we calculated an individual subsidy rate for each producer/exporter subject to these administrative reviews. For the period January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994, we determine the net subsidy for18755 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices NHCI to be 4.48 percent ad valorem . This rate adjusts the rate of 4.01 percent found in the Preliminary Results to a f.o.b. basis ( see the GIA at 37237). We will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess countervailing duties as indicated above. The Department will also instruct Customs to collect cash deposits of estimated countervailing duties in the percentages detailed above of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of subject merchandise from reviewed companies, except from Timminco Limited (which was excluded from the order in the original investigations), entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final results of these reviews. Because the URAA replaced the general rule in favor of a country-wide rate with a general rule in favor of individual rates for investigated and reviewed companies, the procedures for establishing countervailing duty rates, including those for non-reviewed companies, are now essentially the same as those in antidumping cases, except as provided for in \u00a7 777A(e)(2)(B) of the Act. The requested review will normally cover only those companies specifically named. See 19 CFR 355.22(a). Pursuant to 19 CFR 355.22(g), for all companies for which a review was not requested, duties must be assessed at the cash deposit rate, and cash deposits must continue to be collected at the rate previously ordered. As such the countervailing duty cash deposit rate applicable to a company can no longer change, except pursuant to a request for a review of that company. See Federal- Mogul Corporation and The Torrington Company v. United States , 822 F.Supp. 782 (CIT 1993) and Floral Trade Council v. United States , 822 F.Supp. 766 (CIT 1993) (interpreting 19 CFR 353.22(e), the antidumping regulation on automatic assessment, which is identical to 19 CFR 355.22(g)). Therefore, the cash deposit rates for all companies except those covered by these reviews will be unchanged by the results of these reviews. We will instruct Customs to continue to collect cash deposits for non- reviewed companies at the most recent company-specific or country-wide rate applicable to the company, except from Timminco Limited (which was excluded from the order in the original investigations). Accordingly, the cash deposit rates that will be applied to non- reviewed companies covered by these orders are those established in the most recently completed administrative proceeding, conducted pursuant to the statutory provisions that were in effect prior to the URAA amendments. SeePure and Alloy Magnesium from Canada: Final Results of the First (1992) Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews (62 FR 13857 (March 24, 1997)). These rates shall apply to all non-reviewed companies until a review of a company assigned these rates is requested. In addition, for the period January 1, 1994 through December 1994, the assessment rates applicable to all non-reviewed companies covered by these orders are the cash deposit rates in effect at the time of entry.

ACTION: Notice of availability of draft restoration plan and environmental impact statement (RP/EIS). SUMMARY: NMFS, acting as Administrative Trustee, announces the availability of the New Bedford Harbor Trustee Council's (Council) draft RP/EIS for the restoration of natural resources that have been injured by releases of hazardous substances, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in the New Bedford Harbor Environment.Written comments are requested on the draft RP/EIS. DATES: Written comments are requested by June 2, 1997. ADDRESSES : Written comments on the draft RP/EIS, requests for inclusion on the draft RP/EIS mailing list, and requests for copies of any documents associated with the draft RP/EIS should be directed to: New Bedford Harbor Trustee Council, c/o NMFS, F/NEO2, 1 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Jack Terrill, Coordinator, 508\u00b1281\u00b19136. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : A Notice of Availability will be mailed to all agencies, organizations, and individuals who participated in the scoping process or were identified during the RP/EIS process. Copies of the RP/EIS have been sent to all participants who have already requested copies. A. Background New Bedford Harbor is located in southeastern Massachusetts at the mouth of the Acushnet River on Buzzards Bay. Adjacent to the harbor are the communities of Acushnet, Dartmouth, Fairhaven, and New Bedford. New Bedford Harbor is contaminated with high levels of hazardous substances, including PCBs, and is therefore on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Superfund National Priorities List, as well as being identified as a priority Superfund site by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Hazardous materials containing PCBs were discharged directly into the Acushnet River estuary and Buzzards Bay and indirectly via the municipal wastewater treatment system into the same bodies of water. The sources of these discharges were electronics manufacturers who were major users of PCBs from the time that their operations commenced in the late 1940s until 1977, when EPA banned the use and manufacture of PCBs. B. Cooperating Agencies There are three natural resource trustees on the Council representing the Department of Commerce, the Department of the Interior, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Secretary of Commerce has delegated trustee responsibility to NOAA, with NMFS having responsibility for restoration. The Secretary of the Interior has delegated trustee responsibility to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Governor of Massachusetts has delegated trustee responsibility to the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs.18756 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices C. Funding The source of funding for the Council's actions is a $21 million restoration fund, established as a result of settlements between the Federal government, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the companies responsible for releasing PCBs into New Bedford Harbor. A separate account funds the Harbor cleanup. By law and under the terms of the settlement agreements, the Council must finalize a restoration plan for the New Bedford Harbor Environment before funding restoration projects, although necessary plans and studies may be funded before completion of the plan. D. Development of the Draft RP/EIS The Trustees determined that an EIS was the most appropriate means to ensure public participation in the development of restoration alternatives, and to analyze the environmental impact of those alternatives. A Notice of Intent to prepare the RP/EIS was published in the Federal Register (60 FR 10835, February 28, 1995) and initial scoping meetings were held in February and March 1995. Restoration priorities were determined from the list of resources identified as having a high probability of injury within the New Bedford Harbor environment and which would be likely candidates for restoration. The restoration priorities are: species. E. Request for Ideas A request for restoration ideas was published in the Federal Register (60 FR 52164\u00b152169, October 5, 1995). As a result, 56 restoration ideas were received from citizens, non-profit organizations, municipalities, academic institutions, state and Federal agencies, and private businesses. The ideas received are the alternatives analyzed in the RP/EIS. The ideas were reviewed by the Council's community and technical advisory committees and legal counsel. The Committees provided recommendations on which ideas should be preferred alternatives to the Council. The public was invited to comment and a public hearing was held on April 30, 1996. The Council then selected 12 preferred alternatives after considering the public comment and its committees' recommendation. F. Alternatives Analyzed in the Draft RP/EIS The Council is proposing a combination of near-term, future and emergency actions, and plans andstudies, as appropriate, that together would form the basis of an estuary-wide plan to restore the affected environment. This plan evaluates general restoration alternatives as well as specific restoration actions, and establishes a process for the evaluation, selection, and implementation of future restoration actions. G. Preferred Alternatives From among the 56 ideas, the Council selected 12 preferred alternatives for near-term implementation. These ideas, by restoration priority, are as follows: Marshes or Wetlands - Hydrologic restoration of Padanaram Salt Marsh, Dartmouth - Hydrologic restoration of Nonquitt Marsh, Dartmouth Recreation Areas - Recreation and habitat improvements to Fort Taber Park, New Bedford - Riverside/Belleville Avenue Marine Recreational Park, New Bedford Water Column - Hurricane Barrier Box Culvert, New Bedford/Fairhaven Habitats - Eelgrass habitat restoration, New Bedford Harbor and Clarks Cove - Land acquisition, Sconticut Neck, Fairhaven Living Resources - Restoration and management of the New Bedford area shellfishery - Restoration of the Acushnet River herring run Endangered Species - Buzzards Bay tern restoration and habitat stabilization Plans and Studies - Wetlands restoration planning and implementation - New Bedford/Fairhaven Harbor Master Plan (aspects related to natural resources) On finalization of this plan, the Council will begin implementation of selected near-term alternatives. H. Coordination with Ongoing Cleanup Actions Since the Harbor cleanup is ongoing, restoration actions must be coordinated with that process to maximize environmental benefits while ensuring that neither process negates or interferes with the other. As cleanup of the Harbor proceeds, more restoration options will become practicable. The Council proposes an event-based process of idea solicitation and selection to choose future restoration actions, periodically selecting restoration actions that are practicable, effective, and appropriate in the context of the ongoing cleanup. Full public involvement in Councildecisionmaking will be maintained in all aspects of the process. Authority: 42 U.S.C. 10, 1997. Rolland A.

ACTION: Issuance of modification 1 to permit 991 (P599). SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that NMFS has issued a modification to a permit that authorizes takes of an Endangered Species Act-listed species for the purpose of scientific research, subject to certain conditions set forth therein, to the California Department of Water Resources in Sacramento, CA (CDWR). ADDRESSES : The application and related documents are available for review in the following offices, by appointment: Office of Protected Resources, F/PR3, NMFS, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910\u00b13226 (301-713-1401); and Protected Species Division, NMFS, 777 Sonoma Avenue, Room 325, Santa Rosa, CA 95404\u00b16528 (707\u00b1575\u00b16066). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : The modification to a permit was issued under the authority of section 10 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531\u00b11543) and the NMFS regulations governing ESA-listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217\u00b1 222). Notice was published on December 30, 1996 (61 FR 68721) that an application had been filed by CDWR (P599) for modification 1 to permit 991. Modification 1 to permit 991 was issued to CDWR on March 24, 1997. Permit 991 authorizes CDWR takes of juvenile, endangered, Sacramento River winter- run chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) associated with scientificresearch. For modification 1 to permit 991, CDWR is authorized an annual take of juvenile, ESA-listed fish associated with a fisheries study of the Yolo Bypass, a floodplain adjacent to the Sacramento River where large numbers of salmon are trapped when high flows recede. Study results will be used to provide recommendations for ecosystem restoration options, to identify actions to minimize adverse effects to juvenile salmon, and to make habitat restoration efforts as harmless to fish as possible. Modification 1 is valid for the duration of the permit. Permit 991 expires on June 30, 1999. Issuance of the permit modification, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such action: (1) Was requested in good faith, (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the ESA- listed species that is the subject of the permit, and (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA and the NMFS regulations governing ESA-listed species permits.

In exchange of notes, the Governments of the United States and Malaysia agreed to amend the existing visa arrangement for textile products, produced or manufactured in Malaysia and exported on and after May 1, 1997. The amended arrangement consolidates existing and new provisions of the export visa arrangement, including provisions for the Electronic VisaInformation System (ELVIS). In addition to the ELVIS requirements, shipments will continue to be accompanied by an original visa stamped on the front of the original commercial invoice issued by the Government of Malaysia. Goods which currently require an exempt certificate shall not require an ELVIS transmission, but will continue to require the exempt certificate. In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to amend the existing visa requirements for textile products produced or manufactured in Malaysia and exported on and after May 1, 1997. A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see Federal Register notice 61 FR 66263, published on December 17, 1996). Also see 52 FR 32158, published on August 26, 1987. Interested persons are advised to take all necessary steps to ensure that textile products that are entered into the United States for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, will meet the visa requirements set forth in the letter published below to the Commissioner of Customs. Troy H. Cribb, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements April 11, 1997. Commissioner of Customs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229. Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on August 20, 1987, as amended, by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, that directed you to prohibit entry of certain cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products, produced or manufactured in Malaysia for which the Government of Malaysia has not issued an appropriate export visa or exempt certification. Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854); and pursuant to the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) and the Export Visa Arrangement, effected by exchange of notes between the Governments of the United States and Malaysia; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on May 1, 1997, entry into the Customs territory of the United States (i.e., the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealthof Puerto Rico) for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products in Categories 200\u00b1239, 300\u00b1369, 400\u00b1469, 600\u00b1670 and 831\u00b1859, including part categories and merged categories (see Annex A), produced or manufactured in Malaysia and exported on and after May 1, 1997 for which the Government of Malaysia has not issued an appropriate export visa, exempt certification or Electronic Visa Information System (ELVIS) transmission fully described below. Shipments covering merchandise in Categories 800\u00b1810 and 863\u00b1 899 do not require a visa. Should additional categories, part categories or merged categories become subject to import quota the entire category(s), part category(s) or merged category(s) shall be included in the coverage of this arrangement. A visa must accompany each commercial shipment of the aforementioned textile products. A circular stamped marking in blue ink will appear on the front of the original commercial invoice. The original visa shall not be stamped on duplicate copies of the invoice. The original invoice with the original visa stamp will be required to enter the shipment into the United States. Duplicates of the invoice and/or visa may not be used for this purpose. Each visa stamp shall include the following information: 1.The visa number. The visa number shall be in the standard nine digit letter format, beginning with one numeric digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (the code for Malaysia is ``MY''), and a six digit numerical serial number identifying the shipment; e.g., 7MY123456. 2.The date of issuance. The date of issuance shall be the day, month and year on which the visa was issued. 3.The original signature of the issuing official of the Government of Malaysia. 4.The correct category(s), merged category(s), part category(s), quantity(s) and unit(s) of quantity in the shipment as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Correlation and in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, annotated, shall be reported in the spaces provided within the visa stamp (e.g., ``Cat. 340\u00b1510 DOZ''). Quantities must be stated in whole numbers. Decimals or fractions will not be accepted. Merged category quota merchandise may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa or the correct category visa corresponding to the actual shipment (e.g., Categories 347/348 may be visaed as 347/348 or if the shipment consists solely of Category 347 merchandise, the shipment may be visaed as ``Category 347,'' but not as ``Category 348''). U.S. Customs shall not permit entry if the shipment does not have a visa, or if the visa number, date of issuance, signature, category, quantity or units of quantity are missing, incorrect or illegible, or have been crossed out or altered in any way. If the quantity indicated on the visa is less than that of the18759 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices shipment, entry shall not be permitted. If the quantity indicated on the visa is more than that of the shipment, entry shall be permitted and only the amount entered shall be charged to any applicable quota. If the visa is not acceptable then a new visa must be obtained from the Malaysian Government or a visa waiver may be issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce at the request of the Government of Malaysia and presented to the U.S. Customs Service before any portion of the shipment will be released. The waiver, if used, only waives the requirement to present a visa with the shipment. It does not waive the quota requirement. If the visaed invoice is deficient, the U.S. Customs Service will not return the original document after entry, but will provide a certified copy of that visaed invoice for use in obtaining a new correct original visaed invoice, or a visa waiver. If a shipment from Malaysia has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United States with either an incorrect visa or no visa, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, the shipment will be charged to the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or waiver is provided. ELVIS Requirements: A.Each ELVIS message will include the following information: I.The visa number. The visa number shall be in the standard nine digit letter format, beginning with one numeric digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (the code for Malaysia is ``MY''), and a six digit numerical serial number identifying the shipment; e.g., 7MY123456. II.The date of issuance. The date of issuance shall be the day, month and year on which the visa was issued. III.The correct category(s), merged category(s), part category(s), quantity(s) and unit(s) of quantity in the shipment as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Correlation and in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, annotated or successor documents. IV.The quantity of the shipment in the correct units of quantity. V. The manufacturer ID code. B.Entry of a shipment shall not be permitted: I.if an ELVIS transmission has not been received for the shipment from the country of origin; II.if the ELVIS transmission for that shipment is missing any of the following: a. visa number b. category or part category c. quantity d. unit of measure e. date of issuance f. manufacturer ID numberIII.if the ELVIS transmission for the shipment does not match the information supplied by the importer or the Customs Broker acting as an agent on behalf of the importer, with regard to any of the following: a. visa number b. category or part category c. unit of measure IV.if the quantity being entered is greater than the quantity transmitted. V.if the visa number has previously been used, except in the case of a split shipment, or cancelled, except when an entry has already been made using the visa number. C.A new, correct ELVIS transmission from the country of origin is required before a shipment that has been denied entry for one of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph B.I\u00b1V will be released. Visa waivers will only be considered for legitimate classification purposes, or for paragraph B.I\u00b1V if the shipment qualifies as a one-time special purpose shipment that is not part of an ongoing commercial enterprise. D.A new, correct ELVIS transmission from the country of origin is required for entries made using a visa waiver under the procedures as previously described. E.Shipments will not be released for forty- eight hours in the event of a system failure. If system failure exceeds forty-eight hours, for the remaining period of the system failure the U.S. Customs Service will release shipments on the basis of the paper visaed document. If import quotas are in force, U.S. Customs Service shall charge only the actual quantity in the shipment to the correct category limit. If a shipment from Malaysia has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United States with an incorrect visa, no visa, an incorrect ELVIS transmission, or no ELVIS transmission, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, the shipment will be charged to the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or waiver is provided or a new ELVIS message is transmitted. Exempt certification requirements: Shipments of certified hand printed batik, defined as fabric to which the design has been applied by hand in units of the Malaysian cottage industry, shall be exempt from the quota levels if they are certified prior to leaving Malaysia, by the placing of the original rectangular-shaped stamped marking in blue ink on the front of the original commercial invoice. The original exempt certification shall not be affixed to duplicate copies of the invoice. The original copy of the invoice with the original exempt certification will be required to enter the shipment into the United States. Duplicate copies of the invoice and/or exempt certification may not be used. Textiles and textile articles provided for in the exempt certification system are exempt from the levels of restraint, and visa and ELVIS requirements if they are properlycertified, prior to the shipment leaving Malaysia. Each certification stamp shall include the following information: 1. Date of issuance 2.Signature of issuing official 3.The basis for the exemption, which shall be noted as: a. hand printed batik b.the name of the particular traditional folklore handicraft product (Malaysian item) as cited in a list to be agreed upon by the Government of the United States and Malaysia. Should a shipment be exported from Malaysia with an incorrect exempt certification (i.e., the date of issuance, signature or basis for exemption is missing, incorrect or illegible or has been crossed out or altered in any way), then the exempt certification will not be accepted and entry shall not be permitted until a replacement certification is issued. Should a shipment be exported from Malaysia without an exempt certification being issued prior to the date of exportation or if the merchandise does not qualify for the exemption, then an exempt certification will not be accepted and entry shall not be permitted. In such a case, a visa or a visa waiver must be obtained, and an ELVIS transmission sent, prior to release of any portion of the shipment. If quotas are in force, the shipment will be charged to the apropriate quota level. Other Provisions. Merchandise imported for the personal use of the importer and not for resale, regardless of value, and properly marked commercial sample shipments valued at U.S.$250 or less, do not require a visa, exempt certification, or ELVIS transmission for entry and shall not be charged to agreement levels, if applicable. Any shipment which is not accompanied by a valid and correct visa with an ELVIS transmission or exempt certification in accordance with the foregoing provisions shall be denied entry by the Government of the United States unless the Government of Malaysia authorizes the entry and any charges to the agreement levels. The visa and certification stamps remain unchanged. The actions taken concerning the Government of Malaysia with respect to imports of textiles and textile products in the foregoing categories have been determined by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, these directions to the Commissioner of Customs, which are necessary for the implementation of such actions, fall within the foreign affairs exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).

Take notice that on April 3, 1997, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue, S.E., Charleston, West Virginia 25314\u00b1 1599, filed in Docket No. CP97\u00b1313\u00b1000 a petition pursuant to Section 16 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) and Rule 207(a)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.207(a)(2)), for a declaratory order requesting that an existing facility, located in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, be refunctionalized from gathering to transmission. Further, Columbia, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the NGA, requests authorization that this facility refunctionalized to transmission be certificated as a jurisdictional transmission facility, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Columbia states that as a result of a detailed facility review completed in association with preparation of its spin- off application filed in Docket No. CP97\u00b1127\u00b1000, Columbia determined that its Line 12206, an existing facility which is presently functionalized as gathering, serves a transmission function. Columbia states that Line 12206, consisting of approximately 6,041 feet of 8-inch-diameter pipeline, is located between facilities to be sold to Somerset Exploration Corporation and Columbia's transmission facilities. Columbia states that it noted in its application filed in Docket No. CP97\u00b1 127\u00b1000, that it would spin-off certain of its gathering facilities to various purchasers by public auction, and that it would be filing the instant petition to refunctionalize gathering facilities to transmission. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should on or before May 2, 1997, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 384.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR157.10).

Take notice that on April 4, 1997, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), Post Office Box 1492, El Paso, Texas, 79978, filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission), in Docket No. CP97\u00b1326\u00b1 000, under Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) and Section 157.5, et seq., of the Commission's Regulations, for permission and approval to abandon in place a minor segment of mainline pipeline located in Eddy County, New Mexico, and the related natural gas service from its interstate transmission pipeline system, all as more fully described in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.El Paso states that it has determined that a short segment of the Jal-El Paso ``A'' Line, approximately 1,290 feet in length, is no longer required in the operation of its interstate transmission system. El Paso further states that this segment abuts the length of pipeline abandoned by sale to Leapartners, L. P. El Paso asserts that by keeping this segment of pipeline in service, El Paso would retain a redundant facility and continue to incur unnecessary operating and maintenance expenses. Any person desiring to be heard or make protest with reference to said application should, on or before May 2, 1997, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C., 20426, a protest or motion to intervene in accordance with the requirements of Rule 211 or 214 of the Commissions Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10).

Take notice that on April 9, 1997, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco), P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP96\u00b1758\u00b1001 an application, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, requesting authority to amend its certificate issued March 26, 1997, in Docket No. CP96\u00b1758\u00b1000 so as to reduce the project scale and pipe diameter and to revise its initial rates, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Transco states that it seeks to modify its Southeast Louisiana Gathering System, as approved in the March 26, 1997, order. Transco explains that the order authorized it to construct andoperate the following facilities in two phases: Phase I A platform in Ship Shoal Block 14, including associated piping modifications in Ship Shoal Blocks 14 and 28, offshore Louisiana, to connect the platform facilities to the west leg of the SELGS in Ship Shoal Block 28. Approximately 50.71 miles of 30-inch pipeline extending from the new platform in Ship Shoal Block 14 to a tie-in with the east leg of the SELGS in Ship Shoal Block 214. Phase II A junction platform in South Timbalier Block 301. Approximately 26.87 miles of 30-inch pipeline extending from an interconnection with the Phase I facilities and Transco's Ship Shoal Block 214 junction platform to the new South Timbalier Block 301 junction platform. Transco proposed in-service dates for the Phase I and Phase II facilities of November 1, 1997 and November 1, 1998, respectively. Transco estimated that the cost of the overall project would be $129,054,498. Transco states that the Phase I facilities were designed to create firm transportation capacity of 380,113 Mcf per day and 659, 732 Mcf per day after Phase II. The order also authorized Transco proposals to charge incremental rates for service through the proposed expansion. Transco states that it proposes to amend the March 26, 1996, authorization to reduce the size of the proposed 30-inch pipeline to 24-inch diameter pipeline and also to delete Phase II of the expansion. Transco states that these are the only revisions proposed to the certificated facilities. Transco states that the revised cost of the project is $76,360,516 and that the changes in the project scope will reduce the firm capacity of the project to 331,819 dekatherms per day. Transco states that the proposed in-service date for the project will remain November 1, 1997. The locations and routes of the proposed facilities will also remain unchanged. Transco states that based on the revised cost of the facilities, the rate design and cost of service factors approved by the Commission in the March 26, 1997, order and revised billing determinants under the project of 331,819 dekatherms per day times a 70 percent load factor, it requests approval of a revised initial monthly reservation rate of $5.6223 per dekatherm. Transco states that a 70 percent load factor assumption complies with the Commission's policy with regard to minimum volumes to be used for designing rates for facilities located offshore Louisiana.Transco states that in addition to the incremental monthly reservation charge for firm transportation service, it requests approval of a usage rate of $0.1848 per dekatherm for interruptible transportation service to be rendered through the proposed facilities. This rate is based on the 100 percent load factor equivalent of the revised monthly reservation rate and will be charged only to those shippers specifically requesting interruptible transportation through the proposed facilities. Interruptible service will be provided under Rate Schedule IT and be subject to its terms and conditions. Transco states that approval of the incremental usage rate is critical to the economic viability of the project and whether or not Transco decides to go forward with the project. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before April 18, 1997, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10).

Transco proposes to expand the Grove Meter Station, an existing delivery point to SCPC, by (1) Installing a 16-inch main line tap and approximately 800 feet of new 16-inch pipe to the Grove Meter Station and retiring 800 feet of 10-inch pipe, (2) retiring, replacing, and expanding the Grove Meter Station piping, odorization system, and other appurtenances, and (3) constructing 1,791 feet of 16-inch pipeline loop from the Grove Meter Station outlet to a tie- in with SCPC's pipeline at the North Carolina/South Carolina state border, all located in Cleveland County, North Carolina, to be referred to as the Grove Meter Station Expansion. Transco states it currently delivers up to 70,000 Dth per day to SCPC at the Grove Meter Station. As a result of the expansion proposed herein, Transco declares the capacity of the Grove Meter Station will be increased to 200,000 Dth per day. Transco asserts it has sufficient delivery flexibility to accomplish such additional deliveries without detriment or disadvantage to its other customers.Transco states the estimated cost to construct the Grove Meter Expansion to be $1,056,736, with SCPC reimbursing Transco for all costs associated with the project. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest.

ACTION: Notice.SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is providing draft guidance to the marketers of food plans that are represented as a total diet and that have been formulated so that the dietary intake of various nutrients by those who participate in the plan is controlled. The agency hopes that this guidance, if finalized, will help to minimize any problems that may develop should firms proceed to market with these plans. DATES: Written comments by July 1, 1997. ADDRESSES : Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA\u00b1305), Food and Drug Administration, 12420 Parklawn Dr., rm. 1\u00b123, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Christine J. Lewis, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS\u00b1 451), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202\u00b1205\u00b14168. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : FDA is aware that there is interest in the food industry in offering a food plan in which most of the food in the diet is purchased through the plan. The foods sold in these plans would be formulated so that the total diet of those who comply with the plan provides controlled levels of such nutrients as fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. FDA applauds innovative efforts to help consumers maintain healthy dietary practices. The agency notes that one of the main purposes of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (the 1990 amendments) was to encourage such practices, and, thus, such plans can be seen, at least conceptually, as consistent with that statute. The agency also recognizes that diets can be structured to be useful in the management of certain chronic conditions. The agency has no desire to do anything that would discourage efforts to achieve these innovative goals. While these plans have the potential to be useful, they also have the potential to create a number of significant concerns under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). The purveyors of such programs will need to take care to ensure that, in presenting these programs to the American consumer, they do not run afoul of any of the provisions of the act. Given this need for care, FDA has concluded that it would be useful to companies that either have decided, or who may decide, to offer such programs, and that it would help to prevent regulatory problems, if the agency outlined the statutory concerns that it can foresee could be created by these programs. Theagency is also setting out its thoughts on these concerns. The agency would welcome comments on these preliminary views from interested persons. The major concerns that FDA has at least preliminarily identified follow. A. Health Claims Under section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(B)) and 21 CFR 101.14(a)(1), a health claim is: * * * any claim made on the label or in labeling of a food, including a dietary supplement, that expressly or by implication, including ``third party'' references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term such as ``heart''), symbols (e.g., a heart symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition. Implied health claims include those statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between the presence or level of a substance in the food and a disease or health-related condition. Thus, for a claim to be a health claim, one of the essential elements is that it be, expressly or by implication, about a particular substance and not about the total diet. The agency points out that, in adopting the health claim final rule, it said that: * * * phrases on labeling such as ``eat a variety of foods to /emlowln/emlowln/emlowln/emlowln/emlowln ,'' ``eat a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables to /emlowln/emlowln/emlowln/emlowln/emlowln ,'' or ``follow the food pyramid to /emlowln/emlowln/emlowln/emlowln/emlowln ,'' without any reference, either express or implied, to a substance that might be in the foods, would not satisfy this element. The latter types of claims would not be subject to regulation as health claims. (58 FR 2478 at 2480, January 6, 1993). The agency thus recognizes that claims about the effects of a diet plan, depending on how the claim is made, would arguably not be subject to regulation as a health claim. FDA advises that it will carefully scrutinize any claims that are made for a diet plan to determine whether they are health claims. For example, a claim that the diet has been designed to provide high levels of vitamin A to reduce the risk of cancer would be a health claim because the statement links the two basic components of a health claim, a food substance and a disease or health-related condition. Any claims that are made that are health claims must be made in accordance with FDA's authorizing regulations, or they will misbrand the products under section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act. B. Nutrient Content Claims A claim that expressly or by implication characterizes the level of a nutrient in a food is a nutrient content18775 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices claim (21 CFR 101.13(b)). Such claims must be made in accordance with FDA's regulations defining the claim (section 403(r)(1)(A) of the act). FDA cautions that care must be taken in how claims are made about diet plans to ensure that the foods in the plan are not represented as having lower, or higher, nutrient levels than they actually contain. For example, a claim that a plan has been formulated to provide low fat foods, as compared to a claim that the plan has been formulated to provide a diet that is low in fat, would imply that the foods in the plan are low fat. Thus, every food in the plan would have to meet the definition for ``low fat'' in 21 CFR 101.62(b)(2) to avoid being misbranded. C. Foods for Special Dietary Use Foods that purport or are represented as to be used to supply a special dietary need that exists by reason of a physical, physiological, pathological, or other condition are foods for special dietary use under section 411(c)(3)(A) of the act (21 U.S.C. 350(c)(3)(A)). There is a substantial possibility that a diet plan may be represented in a way that subjects the foods in the plan to regulation as foods for special dietary use. For example, a claim that the diet plan provides a modified diet, formulated for those who must restrict their sodium intake, would present the foods in the plan as foods for special dietary use. Under section 403(j) of the act, FDA has authority to require, on the label of such foods, information concerning their dietary properties that it finds necessary to fully inform purchasers about their value for special dietary use. FDA advises that, if these diet plans appear on the market, FDA will carefully scrutinize the labeling and advertising for such plans to see whether it is necessary for the agency to invoke its authority under section 403(j) of the act. D. False or Misleading Claims Under section 403(a)(1) of the act, food is deemed to be misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. FDA would expect that any firm that markets a diet plan will have evidence about the effects of following the plan, and that that evidence would establish that any claims that are made about that plan and the food that makes up the plan are truthful and not misleading. FDA also would expect that the firm will share that evidence with FDA. For example, if there is a claim that a plan has been clinically proven to have a certain effect, FDA will expect that at least one properly designed clinical study has been done with theparticular diet plan, that the results of the study or studies fully support the claims that are made, and that the results of the studies will be shared with FDA. E. Drug Claims FDA is concerned that claims made about a diet plan could evidence an intent that the plan is to be used as a drug. Under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)), articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or other animals are deemed to be drugs. Thus, for example, a claim that a diet plan is a ``therapeutic diet'' could subject the plan to regulation under the provisions of the act that apply to drugs and, in particular, new drugs. FDA therefore cautions that manufacturers who decide to market diet plans with claims that subject the plans to regulation as drugs must be prepared to satisfy the applicable statutory requirements. F. Meat and Poultry Products FDA advises that diet plans that include meat or poultry products are also subject to regulation by the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, under the Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act. G. Conclusion In conclusion, FDA advises that this document's discussion of the regulatory requirements that apply to diet plans is not intended to discourage such plans. It is intended to ensure that manufacturers who decide to go forward with such plans do so with an understanding of the act and FDA's regulations. The agency hopes that, by laying out its concerns and expectations, it will help to minimize the problems that will develop should firms proceed to market with these plans and thus to maximize the likelihood that consumers will fully appreciate the benefits that they offer. This draft guidance represents the agency's current thinking on food plans that are marketed as a total diet. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Brian J. Malkin, Office of Health Affairs (HFY\u00b120), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301\u00b1443\u00b11382. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98\u00b1417) and the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100\u00b1670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive, or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive. A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: A testing phase and18776 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices an approval phase. For human drug products, the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B). FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product OXILANTM (loxilan). OXILANTMis indicated for visceral angiography, aortography, and peripheral arteriography. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for OXILANTM(U.S. Patent No. 4,954,348) from Cook Imaging Corp., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated May 28, 1996, FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval of OXILANTMrepresented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period. FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for OXILANTMis 2,757 days. Of this time, 1,644 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 1,113 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates: 1. The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) became effective : June 5, 1988. The applicant claims April 29, 1988, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND) became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was June 5, 1988, which was 30 days after FDA receipt of the IND. 2. The date the application was initially submitted with respect to thehuman drug product under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act : December 4, 1992. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the new drug application (NDA) for OXILANTM(NDA 20\u00b1316) was initially submitted on December 4, 1992. 3. The date the application was approved : December 21, 1995. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20\u00b1316 was approved on December 21, 1995. This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 737 days of patent term extension. Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before June 16, 1997, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested person may petition FDA, on or before October 14, 1997, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41\u00b142, 1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30. Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: April 4, 1997. Allen B.

FORFURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Susan Anderson (410) 786\u00b13996. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : I. Background Under section 1115 of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may consider and approve research and demonstration proposals with a broad range of policy objectives. These demonstrations can lead to improvements in achieving the purposes of the Act. In exercising her discretionary authority, the Secretary has developed a number of policies and procedures for reviewing proposals. On September 27, 1994, we published a notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 49249) that specified (1) the principles that we ordinarily will consider when approving or disapproving demonstration projects under the18777 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices authority in section 1115(a) of the Act; (2) the procedures we expect States to use in involving the public in the development of proposed demonstration projects under section 1115; and (3) the procedures we ordinarily will follow in reviewing demonstration proposals. We are committed to a thorough and expeditious review of State requests to conduct such demonstrations. As part of our procedures, we publish a notice in the Federal Register with a monthly listing of all new submissions, pending proposals, approvals, disapprovals, and withdrawn proposals. Proposals submitted in response to a grant solicitation or other competitive process are reported as received during the month that grant or bid is awarded, so as to prevent interference with the awards process. II. Listing of New, Pending, Approved, Disapproved, and Withdrawn Proposals for the Month of February 1997 A. Comprehensive Health Reform Programs 1. New, Pending, Approved, Disapproved, and Withdrawn Proposals We did not receive any new proposals or approve or disapprove any proposals during the month of February nor were any proposals withdrawn during that month. Therefore, pending proposals for the month of January 1997 published in the Federal Register of March 31, 1997, 62 FR 15187, remain unchanged. B. Other Section 1115 Demonstration Proposals 1. New, Pending, Approved, Disapproved, and Withdrawn Proposals We did not receive any new proposals or approve or disapprove any Other Section 1115 Demonstration Proposals during the month of February nor were any proposals withdrawn during that month. Pending proposals for the month of January 1997 found in the Federal Register of March 31, 1997, 62 FR 15187 remain unchanged, except for the addition of the Minnesota Long Term Care Facility Waiver (a new proposal that was received in January). III. Requests for Copies of a Proposal Requests for copies of a specific Medicaid proposal should be made to the State contact listed for the specific proposal. If further help or information is needed, inquiries should be directed to HCFA at the address above.

This meeting will provide the public an opportunity to comment on U.S. positions leading up to COP10. The Service will discuss U.S. positions on the Agenda for COP10, as well as resolutions and species listing proposals by other countries, and any other itemof interest to the public in relation to CITES COP10. Electronic Access Comments may also be sent via E-mail to: r9oma /emlowlncites@mail.fws.gov. Background The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, hereinafter referred to as CITES or the Convention, is an international treaty designed to monitor and regulate international trade in certain animal and plant species which are or may become threatened with extinction, and are listed in Appendices to the treaty. Currently 135 countries, including the United States, are CITES Parties. CITES calls for biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties which review its implementation, make provisions enabling the CITES Secretariat (in Switzerland) to carry out its functions, consider amending the lists of species in Appendices I and II, consider reports presented by the Secretariat, and make recommendations for the improved effectiveness of the Convention. The tenth regular meeting of the Conferences of the Parties to CITES (COP10) will be held in Harare, Zimbabwe, June 9\u00b120, 1997. A series of Federal Register notices, a public meeting already held, and the public meeting scheduled April 25, 1997 provide the public with an opportunity to participate in the development of U.S. positions for COP10. A Federal Register notice concerning possible U.S. submissions of species amendments and resolutions for consideration at COP10 (with a request for public comments) was published on March 1, 1996 (61 FR 8019). A Federal Register notice announcing a public meeting to discuss an international study of the effectiveness of CITES was published on June 14, 1996 (61 FR 30255). A Federal Register notice requesting information on the Service's consideration of amendments to the Appendices was published on August 28, 1996 (61 FR 44324). A Federal Register notice concerning the provisional agenda of COP10 as well as proposed resolutions and agenda items being considered was also published on August 28, 1996 (61 FR 44332). A public meeting held October 3, 1996 solicited comments on proposed U.S. submissions of species amendments, resolutions, and agenda items for consideration at COP10. A public meeting will be held on April 25, 1997 to discuss U.S. positions on species amendments and resolutions submittedby other CITES Parties, and agenda items leading up to COP10. Proposed Negotiating Positions In this notice, the Service summarizes the proposed U.S. positions on agenda items and resolutions for COP10 (other than proposals to amend the Appendices, which are presented in this edition of the Federal Register as a separate notice) which have been submitted by other countries and the CITES Secretariat. A separate Federal Register notice will be published shortly announcing proposed U.S. positions on species listing proposals submitted by other countries. A Federal Register notice was published on March 27, 1997 (62 FR 14689) outlining rationales for resolutions and discussion documents submitted by the United States. Those issues will not be discussed here. Interested members of the public should refer to those notices for discussion of relevant issues. Numerals next to each agenda item or resolution correspond to the numbers used in the provisional agenda [COP10 Doc. 10.1 (Rev.)] received from the CITES Secretariat. However, documents for a number of the agenda items and resolutions have not yet been received from the Secretariat: they will be available on request from the Office of Management Authority after they have been received from the Secretariat. Some documents may not be received until the meeting of the COP itself. A list of documents received by the Service to date is available on request from the Service's Office of Management Authority (see ADDRESSES , above). In the discussion that follows, the description of each proposed resolution is followed by a brief rationale explaining the basis of the U.S. position. The Service will endeavor to publish a Federal Register notice in early June 1997 that details final negotiating positions on all issues (resolutions, species amendments, and other agenda items) pertaining to COP10, with the understanding that new information that becomes available during discussions at COP10 can often lead to modifications of these positions. The U.S. delegation will fully disclose any and all position changes and the rationale(s) explaining them through daily public briefings at COP10. Agenda (Provisional) [Doc. 10.1 (Rev.)] I. Opening Ceremony by the Authorities of Zimbabwe No document will be prepared by the Secretariat on this item. It is traditional that the host country conduct an opening ceremony at a CITES COP.18779 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices II. Welcoming Addresses No document will be prepared by the Secretariat on this item. It is traditional that the host country make welcoming remarks at the opening of a CITES COP. III. Adoption of the Rules of Procedure (this item consists of two subitems) 1. Voting before credentials have been accepted [Doc. 10.4] No document has yet been received from the Secretariat on this issue. The United States believes that delegations to international treaty conferences should be able to obtain credentials from their government prior to attending the meeting, and as such should not be entitled to vote until their credentials are approved. However, some flexibility is acceptable in certain circumstances. The United States does not believe that delegates whose credentials are pending should be denied access to meetings or the ability to speak, but decisions on such issues should go through the Credentials Committee at the COP. 2. Adoption of the Rules of Procedure [Doc. 10.3] A provisional version of the Rules of Procedure, which describe the manner in which a COP is conducted, are distributed prior to all CITES COPs by the Secretariat. The United States proposes to support the provisional version of the Rules of Procedure as received from the Secretariat. The United States is not aware of any changes from previously adopted Rules of Procedure that will be proposed. The United States notes that the Rules of Procedure were modified at COP9 to allow for a simplified procedure for approving secret ballots. The United States notes that the changes were handled smoothly, and does not believe that this provision should be altered. However, at COP9 many country delegates had problems with the procedure by which the Secretariat issued secret ballots. The United States will work through the Bureau at the COP to simplify this process (which would not involve any modification of the Rules of Procedure), in order to be prepared for any secret ballot vote(s). IV. Election of Chairman and Vice- Chairman of the Meeting and of Chairman of Committees I and II and of the Budget Committee No document will be prepared for this item by the Secretariat. The United States will support the election of a Conference Chair from Zimbabwe, and a highly qualified Vice-Chair of the Conference and Committee Chairsrepresenting the geographic diversity of CITES. The Chair of the CITES Standing Committee (Japan) will serve as temporary Chair of the COP until a permanent Conference Chair is elected. It is traditional for the host country to provide the Conference Chair. The Conference Chair will serve as Presiding Officer of the Conference and also of the Conference Bureau, the executive body which manages the business of the Conference: other members of the Conference Bureau include the Committee Chairs (discussed below), the members of the Standing Committee, and the Secretary General. The major technical work of the CITES is done in the two contemporaneous Committees, and thus Committee Chairs must have great technical knowledge and skill. In addition, CITES benefits from active participation and leadership of representatives of every region of the world. The United States will support the election of Committee Chairs and a Vice-Chair of the Conference having requisite technical knowledge and skills and also reflecting the geographic and cultural diversity of CITES Parties. V. Adoption of the Agenda and Working Programme [Doc. 10.1 (Rev.); Doc. 10.2; Doc. 10.2.1; Doc. 10.2.2] Provisional versions of the Agenda and the Working Programme for COP10 have been received from the Secretariat. The United States supports the provisional version of both documents as received from the Secretariat, but continues to review whether some issues currently allocated to Committee I (scientific issues) should be moved to Committee II (management and other technical issues), due to subject matter, workload and time. VI. Establishment of the Credentials Committee No document will be prepared by the CITES Secretariat on this agenda item. The United States will support the establishment of the Credentials Committee. The establishment of the Credentials Committee is a pro forma matter. The Credentials Committee approves the credentials of delegates to the COP by confirming that they are official representatives of their governments, thereby affording them the right to vote in Committee and Plenary sessions. The United States was a member of the Credentials Committee at COP9. VII. Report of the Credentials Committee No document will be prepared by the Secretariat on this agenda item. TheUnited States supports adoption of the report of the Credentials Committee if it does not recommend the exclusion of legitimate representatives of countries that are Parties to CITES. The United States will encourage timely production of Credentials Committee reports at the COP. Adoption of the report is generally a pro forma exercise. Representatives whose credentials are not in order should be afforded observer status as provided for under Article XI of the Convention. If there is evidence that credentials are forthcoming but have been delayed, representatives can be allowed to vote on a provisional basis. A liberal interpretation of the Rules of Procedure on credentials should be adhered to in order to permit clearly legitimate representatives to participate. Exclusion of Party representatives whose credentials are not in order could undermine essential cooperation among Parties. Greater vigilance is necessary however in cases of close votes, or decisions to be made by secret ballot. VIII. Admission of Observers [Doc. 10.5] Support admission to the meeting of all technically qualified non- governmental organizations and oppose unreasonable limitations on their full participation at COP10. Non-governmental organizations representing a broad range of viewpoints and perspectives play a vital and important role in CITES activities and have much to offer to the debates and negotiations at a COP. Their participation is specifically provided by Article XI of the Convention. The United States supports the opportunity for all technically qualified observers to fully participate at COPs, as is standard CITES practice. The United States also supports flexibility and openness in approval of documents produced by non-governmental organizations, and the dissemination of these documents to delegates; such information sharing is vital to decision-making and scientific and technical understanding at a CITES meeting. IX. Matters Related to the Standing Committee (This Item Consists of Three Subitems) 1. Report of the Chairman [Doc. 10.6] No document has yet been received. The United States fully supports the presentation of a report by the Chairman of the Standing Committee (Japan) regarding the execution of the Committee's responsibilities and its activities that accurately reflects the discussions and decisions of the18780 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices Committee. A position on that report is pending receipt of the document. 2. Regional Representation [Doc. 10.7] No document has yet been received. At COP9 membership in the Standing Committee was increased for those CITES regions with a large number of Parties. Current membership on the Standing Committee is as follows: Chair (Japan), two representatives for Asia (Japan and Thailand), three representatives for Africa (Namibia, Senegal, and Sudan), two representatives for Europe (Russian Federation and United Kingdom), one representative for North America (Mexico), one representative for Oceania (Papua New Guinea), two representatives for Central, South America, and the Caribbean (Argentina and Trinidad and Tobago), Depositary Government (Switzerland), Previous Host Country (United States), and Next Host Country (Zimbabwe). There have been further discussions in the Standing Committee since COP9 on the division of responsibilities among regional representatives. Discussions focused on the question of which subregions and topical areas each Regional representative would speak on and officially represent. The issue of clarifying the responsibilities of the Regional representatives has also been discussed at meetings of the Animals and Plants Committees. The United States proposes to support a division of responsibilities as decided independently by each Region. 3. Election of New Regional and Alternate Regional Members The United States encourages membership which will continue the active role of the Standing Committee. The Regional Representative for North America from COP9 until the present has been Mexico. Discussions will take place at the beginning of COP10 among the three North American CITES Parties (United States, Mexico, and Canada) on which country should be the regional representative between COP10 and COP11. X. Reports of the Secretariat (This Item Consists of Three Subitems) The United States considers the issues which the documents cover essential and important matters. However, no documents have yet been received. Positions on these matters are pending receipt of documents. 1. Secretariat Report [Doc. 10.8] 2. Strategic Plan [Doc. 10.9] The United States notes that the strategic plan of the Secretariat adoptedat COP9 was a beginning, but was in need of much improvement. In order to improve the effectiveness of strategic planning for CITES, the United States supports the recommendation of the ``Study of the Effectiveness of the Convention'' (see item , XIII.1., below) that the Secretariat should develop a strategic plan to guide its work. As stated in the Study of the Effectiveness of the Convention, produced by Environmental Resources Management (ERM), the ``...plan should include programme and policy requirements with a priority set of actions to be undertaken by the Parties, Standing Committee and Secretariat.'' The United States believes that a strategic plan must be developed in consultation with the Standing Committee and the Parties, and as such anything submitted by the Secretariat for consideration at COP10 will need close scrutiny by the Parties. The United States has no objection in principle to the Secretariat seeking or contracting with outside organizations or persons for assistance in drafting this plan, but any action by the Secretariat, including candidates and the final selection should be openly and completely discussed in the Standing Committee, and final approval of any outside entities to perform work in this regard should rest with the Standing Committee in consultation with the Secretariat. 3. Working Plan [Doc. 10.10] The United States looks forward to a detailed analysis of the working plan of the Secretariat. The Secretariat must be guided by the Conference of the Parties in its work plan for the period between COP10 and COP11, and as such it is up to the COP to review the draft working plan and decide on the work and structure of the Secretariat that it deems most appropriate, in line with the priorities of the Parties. The United States believes that discussion of the working plan and strategic plan must be in concert with discussions in the Budget Committee, and in full recognition of any budgetary implications. XI. Financing and Budgeting of the Secretariat and of Meetings of the Conference of the Parties (This Item Consists of Four Subitems) No document has yet been received. The United States advocates fiscal responsibility and accountability on the part of the Secretariat and the Conference of the Parties. The United States plans to be an active participant in discussions in the Budget Committee at COP10.1. Financial Report for 1994, 1995 and 1996 [Doc. 10.11] No document has yet been received. Issues associated with the financial report of the Secretariat will be fully discussed at COP10 and the United States will closely scrutinize and analyze the relevant documents. 2. Anticipated Expenditures for 1997 [Doc. 10.12] No document has yet been received. Issues associated with anticipated 1997 expenditures of the Secretariat will be fully discussed at COP10 and the United States will closely scrutinize and analyze the relevant documents. 3. Budget for 1998\u00b12000 and Medium- term Plan for 1998\u00b12002 [Doc. 10.13] No document has yet been received. The United States will closely scrutinize and analyze the document(s) when received. The United States believes that it is important to coordinate Budget Committee discussions with discussions in Committees I and II that may have budgetary implications. For example, when a resolution with budgetary implications is approved by Committee I or II (and then sent to Plenary for adoption), it should be conveyed to the Budget Committee in time for it to be factored into the budget. There have been cases at previous meetings of the COP where the Budget is already approved, and the Committees are making decisions that may have financial implications. The United States will work through the Bureau at the COP to deal with this issue. 4. External Funding [Doc. 10.14] External funding refers to the financial support by Party governments and non-governmental organizations for projects that have been approved as priorities for CITES by the Standing Committee under a previously established procedure. This procedure is designed to avoid any conflicts of interest or even the appearance of a conflict when approving projects and channeling funds between the provider and recipient. These externally funded projects are outside of the CITES Trust Fund. It has been decided by the Standing Committee that under no circumstances are the UNEP overhead costs to be assessed on these projects. The United States, through the Department of the Interior, and the Department of State, continues to contribute external funding to Standing Committee-approved projects including delegate travel to the COP, support for committee meetings, CITES enforcement and implementation training, and18781 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices biological studies of significantly traded species. XII. Committee Reports and Recommendations (This Item Consists of Four Subitems) 1. Animals Committee (a) Report of the Chairman [Doc. 10.15] No document has yet been received. The United States fully supports the presentation of a report by the Chairman of the Animals Committee regarding the execution of the Committee's responsibilities and its activities that accurately reflect the discussions and decisions of the Committee. A position on that report is pending receipt of the document. (b) Regional Representation [Doc. 10.17] The United States supports the active role of the Animals Committee in scientific and management issues pertaining to animal species listed in the CITES Appendices. We encourage membership which will continue the active role of the Animals Committee, and selection of a Chair with a strong commitment to a proactive Animals Committee committed to conservation. The United States has always participated actively in the work of the Animals Committee, and will continue to be an active participant in all Committee functions. At COP9 membership on the Animals Committee was increased for those regions with a larger number of Parties. Current membership includes: Africa (two representatives), Asia (two representatives), Europe (one representative), North America (one representative), Oceania (one representative), Central, South America, and the Caribbean (two representatives). The Regional representatives are selected by their respective regional caucuses at the COP. The Chair and Vice-Chair will be selected by the new Animals Committee, during a meeting to be held at the close of COP10. During recent discussions in the Animals Committee the issue of increased representation for the European Region was discussed, since the Region now has 31 countries and was not given additional representation at COP9. Consequently, at COP10, there may be a recommendation to increase the number of representatives for the European Region to two. The United States proposes to support an increase of one additional representative for the European Region. The United States has submitted a resolution ``Establishment of Committees'' (Doc. 10.27) for the purpose of amending Res. Conf. 9.1,Annexes 2 and 3. This resolution discusses the designation of members of the Animals and Plants Committees. It recommends that membership should be for Parties only, and cannot be awarded to individuals. The United States strongly believes that Party countries, not individuals, are members of CITES, and therefore proposed this change to be consistent with standard international practices, and to avoid potential, perceived, or real conflicts of interest. (c) Election of New Regional and Alternate Regional Members Currently, Dr. Charles Dauphine of Canada is the North American regional representative on the Animals Committee. The United States anticipates adoption of our proposed resolution that will change the regional representative to a country rather than an individual (as discussed above). At COP10, the United States, Canada, and Mexico will meet to decide which country should be the regional Animals Committee representative between COP10 and COP11. At that time, the country will nominate an individual to serve as contact point. If that individual cannot continue serving for any reason, the country selected will nominate another individual. The other CITES geographic regions will also meet and decide on their Animals Committee representatives. Those decisions are made by the individual regions. The United States position will be to encourage regions to nominate countries that are committed to full participation in the work of the committees. 2. Plants Committee (a) Report of the Chairman [Doc. 10.16] No document has yet been received. The United States welcomes the presentation of a report by the Chair of the Plants Committee regarding the execution of the Committee's responsibilities and its activities, that accurately reflects the discussions and decisions of the Committee. A position on that report is pending receipt of the document. (b) Regional Representation [Doc. 10.7] At COP9, as with the Animals Committee, membership on the Plants Committee was increased for those regions with a larger number of Parties. Current membership includes: Africa (two representatives), Asia (two representatives), Europe (one representative), North America (one representative), Oceania (one representative), and Central, South America, and the Caribbean (tworepresentatives). The Regional representatives are selected by their respective Regional caucuses at COP10, and a Chair and Vice-Chair will be selected by the new Plants Committee, during a meeting to be held at the close of COP10. (c) Election of New Regional and Alternate Members Currently, Dr. Bruce MacBryde of the Service's Office of Scientific Authority is the North American Regional representative to the Plants Committee. The United States anticipates adoption of our proposed resolution that will change the regional representative to a country rather than an individual (as discussed above under Animals Committee). At COP10, the United States, Canada, and Mexico will meet to decide which country should be the regional Plants Committee representative between COP10 and COP11. At that time, the selected country will nominate an individual to serve as its contact point. If that individual cannot continue serving for any reason, the country selected will nominate another individual. The other CITES geographic regions will also meet and decide on their Plants Committee representatives. Those decisions are made by the individual regions. The United States position will be to encourage regions to nominate countries that are committed to full participation in the work of the committees. 3. Identification Manual Committee [Doc. 10.17] No document has yet been received. The United States will continue to support the continuing development of animal and plant identification manuals for use by port and border enforcement authorities, in providing a standard of reference for the identification of CITES species, within available resources and priorities. The United States particularly applauds the United Kingdom's efforts in developing the general CITES guide to plants in trade. The United States plans to assess all alternatives presented by the Secretariat for updating animal sections of the Identification Manual, and encourages and will consider all comments from other Parties as to the value of the Identification Manual. The United States also believes that the posting of the Identification Manual on the Internet to facilitate access by all CITES Parties should be explored and discussed, considering all the costs and benefits of so doing. The United States believes that enforcement officers of the Parties must be equipped with guides which are18782 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices accurate, realistic, and helpful in the identification of the many CITES species and products found in trade throughout the world. Toward this end, the United States supported the efforts of the Canadian government in producing a series of extremely useful and highly professional identification manuals for CITES species in international trade. 4. Nomenclature Committee No document has yet been received. The United States will examine any documents received from the Secretariat on this agenda item, and formulate any further necessary position(s) at that time. (a) Report of the Chairman [Doc. 10.18] b) Recommendations of the Committee [Doc. 10.19] XIII. Evolution of the Convention (This Item Consists of Two Subitems) 1. How to Improve the Effectiveness of the Convention (a) Comments from the Parties and Organizations on the Study [Doc. 10.20] At the Ninth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 1994 (COP9), the Conference of the Parties decided to assign the CITES Standing Committee the task of conducting a review of the effectiveness of the provisions and implementation of the Convention, and to report its findings to the next meeting of the Conference of the Parties. The terms of reference are found in COP9 document number Com. 9.10 which is a draft decision of the COP, later directed to the Standing Committee as a final decision of the COP. The CITES Standing Committee appointed a team to undertake the review including an independent consultant and two individuals chosen by the Committee for the information gathering portion of the project. On December 21, 1994, the CITES Secretariat published Notification to the Parties No. 831, which contained a call for proposals from prospective consultants to conduct the study on the effectiveness and implementation of the Convention. The firm of Environmental Resources Management (ERM), based in London, United Kingdom, was ultimately selected for the task. That selection was made by a Monitoring Committee of CITES Parties, including several representatives to the CITES Standing Committee. The Monitoring Committee, which was selected by the Standing Committee, was made up of representatives of the followinggovernments: Argentina, Canada, Japan, Namibia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The study itself and the report that was produced were reviewed by the same Monitoring Committee, and the report was presented to the December 1996 meeting of the CITES Standing Committee. The CITES Standing Committee selected Jaques Berney (retired Deputy Secretary General of CITES) and Marshall Jones (Assistant Director for International Affairs, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) or Dr. Susan Lieberman (Chief, CITES Operations Branch, Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), as the technical advisors on the project. The initial phase of this review was designed to collate information including but not necessarily limited to the following: the stated and implied objectives of the Convention and their continued relevance to the conservation of wild fauna and flora; the degree of effectiveness of conservation for representative species listed in the three Appendices of CITES and the extent of this degree of conservation that can be attributed to the implementation of the Convention; the relationship of the Convention to other global or regional conservation treaties or agreements and how the objectives of the Convention may be enhanced or hindered by the existence and implementation of these treaties or agreements; the ease and effectiveness of implementation, including enforcement, of the Convention in Party states; and the anticipated and actual roles of various participants in the implementation of the Convention, including Party states, non-Party states, national and international conservation organizations, and national and international trade and development organizations. ERM, the contractor on the study, transmitted a questionnaire to all CITES Parties (132 countries at the time), as well as international non-governmental organizations. In addition, representatives of ERM met in person with several governments, in order to obtain more detailed responses to the questionnaire and in order to assist ERM in preparing its report on the effectiveness of the Convention. ERM was not able to meet with all Parties to the Convention while preparing their report, due primarily to time constraints inherent in the project. Therefore, ERM invited other countries in the region of the Party it was visiting to attend the meetings in question for group as well as private consultations (discussed in greater detail, below).Each country that was visited was asked by ERM to independently decide how to consult with neighboring countries, as well as with non- governmental organizations; the questionnaire sent to the Parties recommends broad consultation. The United States supported an exceedingly broad, transparent, and consultative process, with active input from all non- governmental organizations interested in the effectiveness of CITES and the conservation of species subject to international trade. ERM stated that it was limited in the countries it planed to visit, based on time and funding constraints. The Monitoring Committee mentioned above worked with ERM to plan the country visits. As outlined in the ERM Study, national consultations, headed by either ``core team members'' of the ERM Study or ERM regional office staff, were held in the following regions and countries (the consultations in question were variable in levels of contact and depth as indicated in the ERM Study): Africa (Egypt, Kenya, Namibia, Senegal, South Africa and Zimbabwe); Asia (India, Japan and Thailand); Europe (separate consultations with members of the European CITES Committee and the Russian Federation); North America (Canada, Mexico and the United States); Oceania (Australia); and South America, Central America and the Caribbean (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Trinidad and Tobago). In addition to these consultations, ERM held meetings with CITES Secretariat staff and international non- governmental organizations (the World Conservation Union-IUCN, the World Wide Fund For Nature/World Wildlife Fund-WWF, Trade Records Analysis of Fauna and Flora In Commerce- TRAFFIC, and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre-WCMC). ERM also indicated that they consulted with the Secretariats of the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling (IWC), and the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). The United States appreciates that ERM produced a final report within the allotted time constraints, and met and consulted with many governments, non- governmental organizations, and other bodies during preparation of the study. Although the views of countries were obtained from questionnaire responses and the in-country meetings arranged by18783 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices ERM, the United States regrets that the time constraints placed on ERM in conducting this study precluded substantive, detailed discussions with the majority of the Parties. In addition, the United States is concerned that the ERM questionnaire did not specifically pose questions which directly addressed issues related to enforcement issues of the Convention. Nevertheless, ERM has produced a highly professional report despite these problems. (b) Consideration of the Recommendations Arising From the Study [Doc. 10.21] The United States believes that the ERM study has produced a great quantity of meaningful recommendations and findings, but concurrently believes that some of these could prove controversial. Nevertheless, some of the recommendations of the ERM study could be implemented either directly by the Secretariat or Standing Committee, or adopted by the Conference of the Parties with little controversy. Therefore, we believe that the Parties must take direct but cautious steps to properly review the recommendations and findings of the report, and act deliberately to advance the interests of the Convention. The United States recommends that the Parties adopt the report and use it as a valuable reference in future decision-making. The ERM report provides a useful perspective on the views of the Parties on a number of issues. The report is to be commended for focusing on majority versus minority viewpoints, which should be used by the Parties in assessing priorities for action that could result from the study. The United States notes that the findings of the ERM report demonstrated quite conclusively that the majority of the Parties of the Convention believe that the text of the Convention should not be amended. This perspective is complemented by ERM highlighting the high monetary costs and logistical requirements which would be incurred in attempting to conduct any such textural amendments. The United States strongly concurs with this view, and hopes that this will discourage efforts to amend the treaty or alter its fundamental objectives. The United States notes that according to the report, the majority of the Parties (including the United States) and international organizations believe there is no reason why the application of CITES should exclude any taxonomic group. The study goes on to say that a minority of the Parties oppose inclusion of commercial fish in the CITES Appendices on the grounds that it ispremature to consider such listing until consultations have been held with the relevant inter-governmental bodies charged with managing these species and that there is often insufficient information available to allow adequate listing proposals to be developed. While the United States supports many of the ERM recommendations, the United States disagrees with others and find some unclear for a variety of reasons. Other recommendations could be acted on by the Secretariat, Standing Committee, or the meeting of the Conference of the Parties. Many of the recommendations in the ERM report could be acted on without the introduction of resolutions. In response to a request from the CITES Standing Committee and a Notification to the Parties, the United States submitted detailed comments on the ERM report on March 14, 1997, including comments on all recommendations in the report; those comments are available by contacting the Service's Office of Management Authority (see ADDRESSES , above). (c) Co-operation/Synergy With Other Conservation Conventions and Agencies The United States intends to support the concept and practice of cooperation between CITES and other conservation entities, and to support cooperation with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as being potentially useful and relevant to CITES. Representatives of other conservation conventions and agencies should be invited to attend CITES COPs as observers, including; the CBD, Convention on Migratory Species, Ramsar, World Heritage Convention, Convention on Desertification and Drought, Convention on the Law of the Sea and regional agreements as appropriate. The United States agrees that cooperation with the CBD is potentially useful and relevant to the purposes of CITES. It is not clear that it is necessary to negotiate a comprehensive agreement between the Secretariats. Cooperation between Conventions will be most effective if it evolves out of recognition of the contribution each can make to the other. It may be best to let the relationship between the two conventions evolve as the CBD matures, rather than to mandate cooperation. Mandated cooperation without a clear sense of how each Convention will benefit may result in more work for each Secretariat and less focus on the goals central to the interests of the Parties to each Convention. It is up to governments to consider the integrationof their obligations under respective Conventions. 2. Relationship Between CITES and UNEP [Doc. 10.23] The United States believes that the current state of the relationship between UNEP and CITES is not only unclear, but potentially quite damaging to the Convention. The United States strongly supports the examination of this relationship, and the renegotiation of the 1992 Agreement between the CITES Standing Committee and UNEP. The United States is actively involved with the Working Group of the Standing Committee that is charged with examining this Agreement. A report of the Working Group will be presented to the Parties at COP10. XIV. Interpretation and Implementation of the Convention (This Item Consists of Forty-eight Subitems) 1. Review of the Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties (a) Consolidation of Valid Resolutions [Doc. 10.24] No document has yet been received. The United States has been supportive of the process of consolidation of valid resolutions, since its inception after COP8 as a Standing Committee project. At the 36th meeting of the Standing Committee the United States provided comments on proposed consolidations of resolutions regarding cetaceans. At the 37th meeting of the Standing Committee the United States supported the Secretariat's efforts to consolidate the resolutions pertaining to cetaceans. The United States recognizes these extant resolutions as current and valid. The Standing Committee agreed to this consolidation. The Committee was presented a draft consolidation on ranching resolutions by the Secretariat. The United States supported the consolidation, with the exception of the Secretariat's proposal to include marine turtle ranching (Resolution Conf. 9.20) in the consolidation. The Standing Committee agreed with the United States, and it is the U.S. position for COP10 that the consolidated ranching resolution should not include the marine turtle ranching resolution from COP9 (Conf. 9.20). At the 37th meeting of the Standing Committee the Secretariat noted that it would produce additional draft resolutions consolidating previous resolutions for COP10. These drafts have not yet been received from the Secretariat. The United States expressed support for the consolidation process, and continues to do so. These consolidations are procedural, and do18784 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices not involve renegotiation of any previously adopted text. The tentative position of the United States is to fully support the continuing effort to consolidate existing Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties provided that the consolidation process provides a more ``user-friendly'' product and does not create consolidated resolutions which impinge on the validity of resolutions which are still sound. (b) Index of Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties [Doc. 10.25] This resolution, submitted by Australia, recommends and proposes an alphabetical index of resolutions of the Conference of the Parties from Res. Conf. 1.1 to Res. Conf. 9.26 (all resolutions adopted from the first CITES COP, through COP9 held in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida). The United States considers the Index of Resolutions to be a very good idea that could be an effective tool to assist Parties in administrating their responsibilities under the Convention. The index could serve as a guide to all Resolutions and a historical record of Resolutions in force, repealed, and amended. However, the United States proposes not to support the document as drafted. Considerable work needs to be done on the index and input from the Parties gained during its development. The index needs to be revised to reference all resolutions that pertain to a subject and reviewed to ensure that the information is accurate. In addition, the index would be more useful with some format changes, such as alphabetizing categories under each major heading and converting lengthy phrases to key words. The United States is contacting Australia to discuss our proposed position and suggest we would work with them and other interested Parties between this Conference of the Parties and the next to complete the document. If the Parties agree to this approach at COP10, the document once completed could be forwarded to the Standing Committee for review and, if accepted, to the Secretariat for distribution to the Parties and interested non-governmental organizations (prior to COP11). 2. Report on National Reports Under Article VIII, Paragraph 7, of the Convention [Doc. 10.26] No document has yet been received. The United States proposes to support efforts to encourage all Parties to submit annual reports, for all species of fauna and flora, consistent with their domestic legislation. Each Party is required by the Convention to submit an annual reportcontaining a summary of the permits it has granted, and the types and numbers of specimens of species in the CITES Appendices that it has imported and exported. Accurate report data are essential to measure the impact of international trade on species, and can be a useful enforcement tool, particularly when comparing imports into a given country, contrasted with export quotas from other countries. The United States is current in its Annual Report obligations. 3. Amendment to Resolution Conf. 9.1 on Establishment of Committees [Doc. 10.27] This is a U.S.-sponsored resolution. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the U.S. submission of this resolution. 4. Enforcement (a) Review of Alleged Infractions and Other Problems of Implementation of the Convention [Doc. 10.28] Article XIII of the Convention provides for COP review of alleged infractions. The Secretariat prepares an Infractions Report for each COP, which details instances that the Convention is not being effectively implemented, or where trade is adversely affecting a species. The United States proposes to support the Secretariat's biennial review of alleged infractions by the Parties, and necessary and appropriate recommendations to obtain wider compliance with the terms of the Convention. The United States also proposes to support an open discussion at COP10 of major infractions, and the enforcement of the laws and regulations implementing the Convention. The United States received a draft copy of the Infractions Report to be presented at COP10 from the Secretariat and made comments on all matters concerning the United States. A final version of the report has not been received. When it is received from the Secretariat, it will be closely scrutinized by the United States, and comments provided to the Secretariat if necessary. The United States supports the hard work of the Secretariat in assembling the Infractions Report. However, the United States is concerned that the draft report did not demonstrate a special focus on high priority infractions and violations of the Convention. For example, some cases of technical errors or document irregularities received more attention than major criminal cases involving smuggling of Appendix I species and cooperation among the enforcement agencies of several governments. For example, one case inthe draft report refers to the sentencing of a major parrot smuggler in the United States to almost 7 years in prison and a significant fine; this case involved excellent cooperation with several other governments, and the crimes involved caused serious potential harm to macaw populations in South America. Many other countries have also prosecuted significant violators since COP9, and the United States has urged the Secretariat to highlight such cases in the final Infractions Report. The first draft of the Infractions Report contained numerous such alleged infractions, including some related to U.S. implementation of the Convention. As with previous Infraction Reports prepared by the Secretariat, there is a great difference in the depth of reporting of different alleged infractions, due to what appear to be a variety of reasons, but primarily because Parties to the Convention have not communicated sufficient information to the Secretariat regarding these matters. It appears that, as with previous infraction reports, a large number of alleged infractions may be caused by a lack of training, personnel or knowledge on the workings of CITES. These are matters that can be addressed and significantly improved. The majority of the alleged infractions highlighted in the draft Infractions Report for COP10 should be issues of major concern to the Parties as they have serious consequences for the effectiveness of the Convention, and for conservation. (b) Working Group on Illegal Trade in CITES Specimens [Doc. 10.29] This is a U.S.-sponsored resolution. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997 for a rationale explaining the U.S. submission of this resolution. (c) Inspection of Wildlife Shipments [Doc. 10.30] This is a U.S.-sponsored resolution. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the U.S. submission of this resolution. 5. National Laws for Implementation of the Convention [Doc. 10.31] (a) Analysis of the National Legislation of Parties (b) Measures Taken by Parties to Improve Their Legislation (c) Measures to be Taken With Regard to Parties Without National Legislation (d) Technical Assistance Provided to Parties No documentation has been received on any of the listed topics under this sub-item. The United States will18785 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices examine any documents received from the Secretariat on these topics, and then formulate any further necessary position(s). Generally, the U.S. is strongly supportive of the COP8-initiated review of national laws for the implementation of the Convention; such laws are required of Parties under Article VIII of CITES. The Service has in the past provided funding for this Secretariat- sponsored activity, and has received reviews of national legislation for several countries. The U.S. strongly believes that the Convention's effectiveness is undermined when Party states do not have national laws and regulations in place for implementing CITES, including laws and regulations which authorize the seizure and/or forfeiture of specimens imported or exported in contravention of the Convention, as well as penalties for such violations. The project, which was approved by the Parties at COP8, will identify deficiencies and highlight those Parties in need of improvements in their national CITES implementing legislation. Parties which are identified as not having adequate legislation are required under a decision reached at COP9 to have initiated efforts to enact such laws. At the 37th meeting of the Standing Committee Doc. SC.37.10 on this topic was discussed, as the current project has categorized the adequacy of Parties' national CITES legislation with numerical assignments of 1, 2, and 3 (3 representing the most inadequate legislation). The U.S. noted at this meeting that action is needed at COP10 to address those countries that have made no progress enacting relevant laws, and have not even communicated with the Secretariat or initiated any efforts towards that end. 6. Training [Doc. 10.32] No document has yet been received. The United States has provided training on CITES enforcement and/or implementation since COP9 in: Bangladesh, China, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nepal, the Philippines, Russia, and Taiwan. The United States is currently planning several more training programs for the coming years, and considers this a very high priority activity. The United States supports all efforts by the Secretariat and other Parties to the Convention to provide training in CITES implementation and enforcement to other Parties who are in need of such. The Parties concur that training is of the highest priority, as evidenced in the ERM Report on the Effectiveness of the Convention. United States will endeavorto ensure that this high priority on training will be reflected in the CITES Budget adopted at COP10. 7. Implementation of the Convention in Small Island Developing Nations [Doc. 10.33] No document has yet been received. Some small island developing nations, particularly those in Oceania, have been unable to accede to CITES because of the substantial resources which they feel are needed to fully implement and enforce the Convention. Of particular concern is the need to name Management and Scientific Authorities. Therefore, under a plan supported by the government of New Zealand, those countries would be permitted to share the services of a multi-national Management and/or Scientific Authority. The United States supports full international membership in CITES and proposes to continue supporting the plan advanced by New Zealand, and believes it is an excellent avenue towards helping small island developing nations accede to the Convention. 8. Relationship with the International Whaling Commission [Doc. 10.34] This resolution, submitted by Japan, calls for the repeal of Res. Conf. 2.9; that resolution recommends that ``the Parties agree not to issue any import or export permit or certificate'' for introduction from the sea under CITES for primarily commercial purposes ``for any specimen of a species or stock protected from commercial whaling by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.'' In 1978 the International Whaling Commission [IWC] passed a resolution requesting that CITES ``take all possible measures to support the International Whaling Commission ban on commercial whaling for certain species and stocks of whales as provided in the Schedule to the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling .'' At the time the 1978 IWC Resolution was passed, some populations of whales were listed in Appendix I and some in Appendix II. From 1979 to 1983, as zero catch limits were set in the ICRW Schedule for additional populations of whales, the CITES Conference of Parties added those populations of whales to Appendix I. Most importantly, at the Fourth Conference of the Parties in 1983, CITES decided that ``All cetaceans for which the catches are regulated by the IWC and for which the Commission has set catch limits for commercial whaling (except for the West Greenland population of minke whales) and not already on Appendix I would betransferred to that Appendix in 1986, when the IWC decision to implement a pause in commercial whaling comes into effect.'' This action by CITES COP4 established a strong relationship between the two organizations whereby CITES has agreed to reflect IWC decisions in its Appendices. At the most recent meeting (37th) of the CITES Standing Committee, Res. Conf. 2.9 was incorporated into a proposed consolidated resolution for consideration by COP10, although one Party in attendance at the Standing Committee meeting objected to this. The IWC has not lifted the moratorium, although some nations, such as Japan and Norway, call for the lifting of the IWC moratorium. The IWC continues to work on activities that the United States believes must be completed before any consideration can be given to a resumption of commercial whaling. These elements include development of a scientific scheme for setting quotas and division of an observation and monitoring program to ensure that quotas are not exceeded. Japan continues to circumvent the letter of the Treaty by allowing increasing high catches of whales for ``research'' purposes in the Antarctic, and more recently, in the North Pacific. Norway, has since 1993, openly defied the moratorium, by setting its own quota for the take of whales in the North Atlantic. In consideration of the process related to this issue to date, the United States opposes this resolution. 9. Revision of Resolution Conf. 9.3 on Permits and Certificates [Doc. 10.35] This is a U.S. sponsored resolution. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the U.S. submission of this resolution. 10. Interpretation of Article II, Paragraph 2(b), and Article IV, Paragraph 3 [Doc. 10.36] This resolution, submitted by France, recommends (a) that Parties be exempt from the requirements in Article IV, paragraph 3 of the Convention, to monitor exports of species listed in Appendix II for reasons of similarity of appearance, in order to control the trade in other listed species, and (b) to mark such specimens in trade with a special identification tag. The United States proposes to oppose this resolution for several reasons. Listing under Article II.2.b. of the CITES treaty is a very important tool to provide the necessary protection to other species listed in Appendices I and II. The listing in Appendix II for similarity-of- appearance purposes allows for the detection of shifts in the market toward18786 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices species listed for reasons of similarity of appearance (which could put those species at risk as well). In the case of species listed for reasons of similarity of appearance, it is important to sufficiently monitor their international trade to obtain data which could indicate increased levels of trade in them. 11. Interpretation of Article XIV, Paragraph 1 [Doc. 10.37] This resolution, submitted by France, recommends that Parties to the Convention not adopt stricter domestic measures for non-native species, and only institute such steps for indigenous taxa when illegal trade is present. The resolution also recommends that Parties increase their consultation with other range states if enacting stricter domestic measures for non-native species. The United States intends to strongly oppose adoption of this resolution on the grounds that it is contrary to the text of the Convention and represents an infringement on state sovereignty. As Article XIV, paragraph 1 of CITES states: ``The provisions of the present Convention shall in no way affect the right of parties to adopt: (a) stricter domestic measures regarding the conditions for trade, taking possession or transport of specimens of species included in Appendices I, II and III, or the complete prohibition thereof; or (b) domestic measures restricting or prohibiting trade, taking possession, or transport of species not included in Appendices I, II or III.'' The resolution submitted by France ignores the series of resolutions adopted at previous COPs, as well as numerous decisions of the Standing Committee, calling for CITES Parties to adopt stricter domestic measures to improve the effective implementation of the Convention for the conservation of species of global concern, regardless of whether the taxa in question were native or non-native to any particular country. It should also be noted that consultations with range states do occur when Parties are considering listing non-native species in the CITES Appendices. Therefore, range states are consulted and their views and data considered prior to any listing of species in the Appendices. Many countries have adopted a large number of laws and regulations which are stricter domestic measures with regard to imports and exports of CITES- listed species and non-CITES species. Such laws in the United States include the Wild Bird Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 4901 et seq. ), the African Elephant Conservation Act (16 U.S.C.4201 et seq. ), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq. ), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 73 et seq. ), and the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531\u00b11544). The United States has also adopted stricter domestic measures under authority of the Pelly Amendment to the Fisherman's Protective Act (22 U.S.C. 1978). 12. Revision of the Definition of ``Primarily Commercial Purposes'' [Doc. 10.38] This resolution, submitted by Namibia, would amend portions of Conf. 5.10, thus revising the Parties' interpretation of the term ``primarily commercial purposes'' in CITES. Conf. 5.10 was developed to help countries apply the terms ``primarily commercial purposes'', ``commercial purposes'', and ``non-commercial''. The Parties recognized that interpretation of the provisions of Article III, paragraphs 3(c) and 5(c) varied significantly between Parties. Several examples were provided in order to help the Parties address situations that could arise when evaluating whether an import could be considered ``primarily commercial'' or not. The key to understanding both the treaty and Conf. 5.10 however is the fact that the decision on whether or not an import permit is contingent upon the finding of the importing country that the import is for non-commercial purposes. Under this proposed resolution, the ``primarily commercial purposes'' decision would be based on activities in the exporting country, rather than the importing country (as specified in the treaty and Conf. 5.10), such that transactions with Appendix I specimens or derivatives would not be interpreted as being for ``primarily commercial purposes'' despite commercial components if the following conditions are met: (1) the specimens and derivatives result from routine conservation and management programs, including the recovery of natural populations, which are owned and controlled by a government of a Party and (2) the transaction is (a) conducted under the direct and full control of both the importing and exporting governments and is open to inspection by the CITES Secretariat or any body agreed to by both governments and the CITES Secretariat; (b) the exporting country allocates all net income from the transaction to conservation and management programs for the species concerned, its habitat, education and awareness programs, and to the development of communities directly involved in the management and conservation programs; (c) the importing country certifies that theimported specimens will be used in a cultural and traditional manner and will not be re-exported; (d) the exporting government certifies that the export will not be prejudicial to the species, but will enhance the status of the species; and (e) the transaction receives prior approval by the Standing Committee. The United States proposes to oppose this resolution as written, conditions notwithstanding, as it potentially could create loopholes for trade in specimens of Appendix I species, resulting in commercialization that could lead to the extirpation or extinction of a species. It would also weaken the intent of CITES, which was to strictly regulate trade in specimens of Appendix I species (Article II, paragraph 1). The resolution as drafted is not in accordance with the treaty. The United States is sympathetic to the concerns of the proponent country and its conservation efforts; however, the resolution, as written, is inconsistent with the intent of the Convention and could open up loopholes for trade in Appendix I species, that are at a higher risk of exploitation. The draft resolution inappropriately focuses on the purpose of the take of the animal, versus the ultimate use of the animal or specimen. 13. Criteria for Granting Export Permits in Accordance with Article V, Paragraph 2 [Doc. 10.39] No document has yet been received. This agenda item refers to the decision of COP9 directing the Standing Committee to prepare a draft resolution containing criteria for granting export permits in accordance with Article V, paragraph 2 of the Convention. The United States has previously held the position, in agreement with the Secretariat, that such criteria are not necessary, particularly in light of the adoption of Resolutions Conf. 9.3 and 9.25. This position advocated and advanced by the United States was adopted by the Standing Committee at its 37th meeting. The United States will examine any documents received from the Secretariat on this agenda item, and formulate any further necessary position(s) at that time. 14. Illegal Trade in Whale Meat [Doc. 10.40] This is a United States sponsored discussion paper. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the U.S. submission of this resolution.18787 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 15. Illegal Trade in Bear Specimens [Doc. 10.41] No document has yet been received. Discussions at COP10 of the illegal trade in bear specimens will most likely follow from previous discussions held at the last meetings for the Animals and Standing Committees. In response to the serious problems of conservation of bear populations throughout the world caused by the illegal trade in bear parts and products of Appendix I species, the United States placed this issue on the agenda of the Animals and Standing Committees. One important decision of the Animals Committee recognizes that ``bears are native to Asia, Europe, North America, and South America, and as such the problem of conservation of bears caused by illegal trade in their parts and products is a global one.'' The United States believes that this decision is important in that it reflects an awareness that problems of illegal trade are not limited to one region of the world, but affect all populations and all geographic regions. Again, this points to the need for both domestic and multilateral solutions to these problems. Under a request from the Animals Committee, the CITES Secretariat issued Notification to the Parties #946 which stressed the serious problems of bear conservation and illegal trade, and requested that Parties submit for discussion at COP10 information on wild bear populations, trade, threats, legislative and/or regulatory controls on bear harvesting, enforcement, interdiction, and prosecution efforts related to illegal trade, the kinds of bear derivatives and products available on the open market, efforts to promote the use of substitutes in traditional medicines, and information on public education and outreach efforts. The purpose for this notification, and the compilation of information, was to ascertain what the real problems are, what efforts have been made by countries, and what solutions could benefit bear conservation. The United States has responded to this notification and provided information on its bear populations, and trade and enforcement activities. (Copies of this response are available from the Service's Office of Management Authority.) The Secretariat will be compiling and reviewing the responses received from the Parties in response to this notification, and preparing a report for discussion at COP10. Upon receiving this report, the United States will review it closely and develop a policy position. The United States intends tostay deeply engaged with CITES efforts to protect bear populations. 16. Exports of Leopard Hunting Trophies and Skins [Doc. 10.42] No document has yet been received. When relevant documentation is received from the Secretariat, the United States will evaluate it and formulate a policy position. 17. Trade in Tiger Specimens [Doc. 10.43] No document has yet been received. When relevant documentation is received from the Secretariat, the United States will evaluate it and formulate a policy position. At the 36th meeting of the Standing Committee, all Parties were asked to provide information at the Committee's 37th meeting on their efforts to end trade in tiger parts and products, reduce poaching of wild tigers, and implement Conf. 9.13 (Conservation of and Trade in Tigers) passed at COP9. The United States provided such documents to the Secretariat for the 36th and 37th meetings of the Standing Committee. At the 37th meeting of the Committee the United States reported on the following issues: efforts to interdict illegal shipments coming into the United States; training in Asia on CITES enforcement and implementation; progress made by the Service's National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory (Division of Law Enforcement, Ashland, Oregon), including analysis of levels of arsenic, mercury, and other chemicals found in patented traditional Asian medicinal products; the Service's education and outreach program with the United States Asian community and a similar outreach program with the United States traditional Asian medicine practitioner community; the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act passed by the United States Congress and the Service's review of grant proposals under the Act; and funding through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for such grants. (Copies of this document are available through the Service's Office of Management Authority.) On March 13, 1997, the Service announced the awarding of the first-ever grants issued under authority of the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994. The Act provides monies to fund projects that will enhance sustainable development programs to ensure effective long-term rhino and tiger conservation. Congress had authorized $200,000 in funding for fiscal year 1996 and $400,000 for fiscal year 1997. Ten projects receiving funding were announced, includingthree specifically targeted on tiger conservation efforts in India, Indonesia, and Nepal, while two additional projects benefiting both tigers and Asian rhinos were funded in India and Indonesia. Combined awards for these projects total $96,300. Additional monies were allocated to grants for rhino conservation projects (see discussion under item 19). The National Fish & Wildlife Foundation also administers the Save The Tiger Fund, a program funded by Exxon to assist with the conservation of tigers by providing grants to a wide variety of applicants. 18. Trade in African Elephant Specimens (a) Revision of Resolution Conf. 9.16 [Doc. 10.44] No document has yet been received. When relevant documents are received from the Secretariat the United States will review them and develop a policy position. (b) Revision of Resolution Conf. 7.9 [Doc. 10.45] At the 37th meeting of the Standing Committee discussions were held pertaining to the implementation of Conf. 7.9, which establishes the Panel of Experts process for review of proposals to transfer African elephant populations from Appendix I to II. At that meeting the Secretariat recommended repeal of Conf. 7.9 for several reasons, including the view that the new CITES listing criteria (Conf. 9.24) are sufficient. The United States continues to believe that the Panel of Experts review is important and provides an independent assessment that should be retained. The United States recalls that several African elephant range states at the last meeting of the Standing Committee supported continuation of the Panel of Experts process. The United States continues to advocate that the panel review should be expanded to include review of specific ivory importing countries, if so identified in a proposal. The United States believes that the Standing Committee should not make a recommendation to the COP on repeal of Conf. 7.9, but rather should leave that discussion and decision up to the COP. The United States fully intends to evaluate the analyses in the most recent Panel of Experts report, and to take those analyses into consideration in the development of its positions on proposed transfers of certain African elephant populations to Appendix II. (c) Stockpiles of Ivory [Doc. 10.46] No document has yet been received. At COP9, the Conference of the Parties asked the Standing Committee to18788 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices evaluate issues pertaining to ivory stockpiles, and make recommendations to the Parties. At the 37th meeting of the Standing Committee, representatives of Africa reported on a meeting held in Dakar, Senegal of African elephant range states (the United States provided financial assistance for the meeting). At that meeting, several options were presented and agreed upon by the range states. The United States position at the Standing Committee meeting was that no single option should be endorsed by the Standing Committee, as long as the options are fully in accordance with the provisions of the CITES treaty, since countries should be able to evaluate all options. The United States continues to support that position. The United States will evaluate the document being prepared by the Secretariat, and develop its position on it subsequently. 19. Trade in and Conservation of Rhinoceroses No document has yet been received. When relevant documents are received from the Secretariat the United States will review them and develop a policy position. At the 37th meeting of the Standing Committee, the Committee agreed to support the continued efforts of the IUCN/SSC African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) (Doc. SC.37.17), and agreed to endorse efforts by that group to develop indicators to measure the impact(s) of the CITES listing of the species. While endorsing the efforts, the document prepared by the AfRSG was not adopted by the Committee. The United States agreed with the Standing Committee's endorsement of the efforts of the AfRSG, but supported the position of the Committee in not adopting the document. As discussed above, on March 13, 1997, the Service announced the awarding of the first-ever grants issued under authority of the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994. The Act provides monies to fund projects that will enhance sustainable development programs to ensure effective long-term rhino and tiger conservation. Congress had authorized $200,000 in funding for fiscal year 1996 and $400,000 for fiscal year 1997. Four projects were funded, which directly benefit African rhino conservation, two in Kenya, and one each in South Africa and Zaire. An additional five projects were funded, which directly benefit Asian rhinos: two projects are in India and three in Indonesia. Two projects were funded which will benefit both tiger and Asian rhino conservation. Combined awards for these projects totaled $154,221.(a) Implementation of Resolution Conf. 9.14 [Doc. 10.47] (b) Trade in Live Rhinoceroses from South Africa [Doc. 10.48] No document has been received on this issue. At COP9, South Africa's population of the white rhinoceros was transferred to Appendix II, with an annotation to allow only trade in live rhinoceroses and sport-hunted trophies. South Africa is expected to submit a report to COP10 on its implementation of this down listing. The United States interpretation of the proceedings at COP9 was that there would be a proposal from the Depositary Government (Switzerland) to transfer the population back to Appendix I, submitted to COP10, as well as a proposal from South Africa to retain the population back to Appendix II (if it wanted to do so). The Secretariat's interpretation differed, and the Secretariat has informed the United States that no such procedure is necessary. The United States notes that South Africa has submitted a proposal to ``amend'' its annotation for this species. The United States believes that this proposal constitutes a new species proposal, one which would transfer the population to Appendix II, and as such must be evaluated in the context of the CITES listing criteria in Resolution Conf. 9.24. The United States believes that these annotations bring up important issues that will be addressed once a document is received on this agenda item. 20. Exports of Vicu n\u00c4a Cloth [Doc. 10.49] No document has yet been received. The United States will develop its position after the document is received. 21. Conservation of Edible-Nest Swiftlets of the Genus Collocalia [Doc. 10.50] This document has not yet been received from the Secretariat. At COP9, in response to submission of a proposal to include these species in CITES Appendix II, a decision was adopted to convene an international scientific and management workshop on the conservation of edible-nest swiftlets in the genus Collocalia. This agenda item will discuss the results of that workshop, held in Indonesia in 1996. The United States did not attend the workshop, and will develop its position after the document is received. 22. Biological and Trade Status of Sharks [Doc. 10.51] No document has yet been received. The United States has actively participated in the implementation ofConf. 9.17 which directs the Animals Committee to report to COP10 on the biological and trade status of sharks. The Animals Committee prepared a discussion paper in this regard. Conf. 9.17 also requested that the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) and international fisheries management organizations establish programs to collect and assemble the necessary biological and trade data on sharks species, and that such information be distributed to the Parties at COP10. The recommendations contained in the Animals Committee discussion paper call for continued cooperation between the FAO, international fisheries organizations, and CITES. In addition, many questions were raised concerning technical and practical aspects of implementation concerns associated with inclusion of marine fish species which are subject to large-scale commercial harvesting and international trade, and also listed on the CITES Appendices. In order to provide a framework for this and other activities that CITES will undertake to implement Conf. 9.17, the United States has introduced a resolution for consideration at COP10 concerning the formation of a Marine Fishes Working Group. See the Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the United States submission of this resolution. 23. Trade in Plant Specimens No document has yet been received. The United States will develop its position after the document is received. (a) Implementation of the Convention for Timber Species [Doc. 10.52] At the 37th meeting of the Standing Committee, the Deputy Secretary General of CITES, acting as Chair of the Timber Working Group (TWG), introduced document Doc. SC.37.13, which sought the direction of the Committee on recommendations to be made to the Parties at COP10. (As noted at this meeting, the Secretariat planned to re-introduce this document, unchanged, to COP10 for consideration by the Parties.) At the Standing Committee meeting, the United States noted the positive, productive, and cooperative tone which characterized the TWG meetings. The United States also noted that the document submitted by the TWG (Doc. SC.37.13) was assembled by the technical experts who attended the Group's meetings. The United States agreed that the resolutions drafted by the TWG should be submitted to COP10, except the one entitled Regarding Appendix III Listings (TWG.02.Concl.04 (Rev.)). The United18789 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices States strongly opposed this recommended amendment of Conf. 9.25, and proposes to continue to do so at COP10. That draft resolution concludes that limiting an Appendix III listing to geographically separate populations would not necessarily result in enforcement difficulties for Parties; the U.S. disagrees. The draft does not take into account implementation and enforcement concerns, especially for species other than timber tree species. The United States believes that the draft resolution is a misinterpretation of Appendix III. The topic of extending the term of the TWG was also discussed by the Group itself and reported at the Standing Committee meeting. The TWG recommended that extending the term of the working group be considered, if technical issues need to be addressed, with the same membership, but be convened only at the request of the Standing Committee, to discuss specific issues. The United States supported that recommendation, with the caveat that the Terms of Reference of the TWG remain the same. With regards to United States financial support for future TWG meetings, the United States position is that any such funding is dependent on Federal agency budgets, about which information is not currently available. However, continued financial support from the United States for future TWG meetings should not be considered likely given expected budgetary pressures. (b) Amendment to the Definition of ``Artificially Propagated'' [Doc. 10.53] No document has yet been received. The United States will develop its position after the document is received. (c) Disposal of Confiscated Live Plants [Doc. 10.54] No document has yet been received. The United States will develop its position after the document is received. The United States has established a system of Plant Rescue Centers (PRC) for the placement of confiscated live plants. The Service's Office of Management Authority and the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) work together closely on the implementation of this rescue center program. 24. Significant Trade in Appendix II Species (a) Animals [Doc. 10.55] No document has yet been received. When relevant documents are received from the Secretariat the United Stateswill review them and develop further policy positions as warranted. At the 12th meeting of the Animals Committee, the review of species slated for examination in 1995 under the Significant Trade Review process (Conf. 8.9) was discussed at length and recommendations to the Secretariat from each of the CITES Regions were made through the Committee Chair. Prior to the 13th meeting of the Committee it was not clear whether the Secretariat had fully followed through with primary and secondary recommendations made to range States which are developed in this process. In reviewing the species slated for examination in 1996, the United States recommended that an assessment of the progress made to date by IUCN on developing a target list be conducted, and the United States advocated a rapid completion of the task if it were not yet complete. In addition, the United States delegation stressed the need for field projects to study significantly traded species in the wild, rather than extensive revision of lists in the Significant Trade Review process. There was considerable discussion about the Significant Trade Review process, particularly regarding concerns that recommendations made to the Secretariat for transmission to the range states are neither specific enough or sufficiently ``action-oriented.'' (The United States endorsed this point.) Concerns were also discussed regarding consultation with range states in lieu of forwarding specific primary or secondary recommendations to the Secretariat, as this was believed to be a misuse of the Significant Trade Review process. Except for corals and queen conch (both species under review in this process), the Secretariat has transmitted primary and secondary recommendations on the 1995 species significant trade review to range States. During discussion at the 13th meeting of the Animals Committee of the 1996 review of taxa in the Significant Trade Review process, there was confusion about the timing of the review cycles used in this process. It was clarified that each cycle should correspond to an interval between meetings of the CITES Conference of the Parties. The United States supported an agreement not to initiate another round of reviews (the 1996 reviews), but to complete the 1995 cycle between that meeting and COP10, and then devote efforts to evaluating the outcomes of previously reviewed species, especially involving Parties receiving primary recommendations from the review process. It was also agreed, and the United States supported the concern, that insufficient resourceswere being applied to field studies and that this aspect of the Significant Trade Review process suffers if new species are reviewed before adequate follow-up, such as field studies, have been implemented for previously reviewed species. The United States introduced a draft resolution on reporting and identification of corals in trade, at the request of the 12th meeting of the Animals Committee. As this is a United States sponsored resolution, see Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the United States submission of this resolution. (b) Plants [Doc. 10.56] The United States proposes to support the recommendations of the working group on significant trade of the Plants Committee. The recommendations are non-controversial, and accomplish a fine-tuning of the process for plants that is already underway for animals. Such an adjustment is needed to accommodate the greater number of higher-taxon listings of plants in Appendix II of the Convention. The United States believes that this process is a generally effective approach, as has been demonstrated for example, with tree ferns, where entire families are listed. 25. Sale of Tourist Items of Appendix I Species at International Airports, Seaports, and Border Crossings [Doc. 10.57] This is a United States sponsored resolution. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the United States submission of this resolution. 26. Trade in Specimens of Species Transferred to Appendix II Subject to Annual Export Quotas [Doc. 10.58] No document has yet been received from the Secretariat. The United States will develop its position after the document is received. 27. Trade in Alien Species [Doc. 10.59] This topic is addressed in an issue document co-sponsored by the United States and New Zealand. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the United States submission of this document. 28. Establishment of a Working Group for Marine Fish Species [Doc. 10.60] This is a United States sponsored resolution. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the United States submission of this resolution.18790 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 29. Scientific Justification for National Export Quotas [Doc. 10.61] This resolution, submitted by Israel, discusses the publication and distribution of CITES export quotas by the Secretariat and recommends the provision of relevant scientific evidence and non-detriment findings by Parties when transmitting their own national export quotas for Appendix II species to the Secretariat. The resolution raises many concerns which the United States shares and provides for interesting points in need of additional consideration and study by the Parties. It brings forth a valid point with respect to the need for non- detriment findings in support of export quotas submitted by many Parties. Since the CITES Convention requires Parties to make a non-detriment finding when issuing an export permit, providing that finding or the documentation of such finding to the CITES Secretariat should not be burdensome to Parties that are effectively implementing the Convention. There have been problems with the quota system where quotas were established and implemented without a scientific justification. The United States supports the preparation of scientific non-detriment findings and justifications by all Parties for the export of indigenous Appendix II species before authorizing or otherwise issuing export permits, as required by the Convention. Quotas submitted to the Secretariat should be supported by scientific documentation in the exporting country, and the Secretariat and Parties should be active in utilizing the Significant Trade Process of review by the Animals Committee to make determinations as to whether Parties are appropriately addressing the scientific needs inherent in issuing realistic and appropriate non- detriment findings. However, this resolution however refers to those quotas that are determined by individual exporting countries, and not those quotas that are approved by the Conference of the Parties. At present, the United States is studying the issue of whether the draft resolution submitted by Israel is needed in order to interpret the Convention. 30. Disposal of Stocks of Dead Specimens of Appendix I Species [Doc. 10.62] The draft resolution would modify Conf. 9.10 in that it recommends that confiscated dead specimens of Appendix I species not be destroyed, but utilized for all useful purposes in accordance with the Convention, in particular for educational, research orscientific activities, but also for ``the cultural and artistic heritage'' (translation provided by the Embassy of France). The resolution makes no reference to the enforcement obligation of Parties to CITES as enumerated in Article VIII, but instead CITES economic and social development provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The United States intends to oppose this resolution and believes that Conf. 9.10 as adopted by the Parties is effective as written. The United States believes that this draft resolution, if adopted, would create a number of enforcement problems, not the least of which would involve the large stockpiles of African elephant ivory currently maintained in a number of range states. By opening the door to the cultural and artistic utilization of stockpiles of Appendix I species, there would be a serious problem of distinguishing between illegal trade and ``cultural'' trade. The United States is concerned that the use of these specimens for cultural or artistic purposes could result in increased consumer demand for other such specimens. In addition, the United States believes that this resolution, if adopted, would detrimentally impact controls on seized Appendix I plants and plant materials. The United States recognizes that there may exist many appropriate cultural or artistic uses of accumulated dead specimens of Appendix I animals and plants. However, the United States also recognizes that establishing appropriate mechanisms to ensure that these specimens are only used in the proper context will be very difficult to achieve. In addition, Conf. 9.10 makes a specific reference to the disposition of accumulated dead specimens of Appendix I plant species. The proposed resolution addresses the disposition of specimens of Appendix I species, making no distinction between animal and plant species. This element of the proposed resolution increases the United States' concern regarding the establishment of appropriate mechanisms to ensure that these specimens are only used in the proper context, and fully in accordance with the Convention. 31. Marking of CITES Specimens [Doc. 10.63] This document was submitted by the CITES Secretariat on behalf of the Animals Committee. The Animals Committee held discussion related to problems of implementation of Conf. 5.16 which lays out the requirements for trade in ranched specimens listed in theAppendices to the Convention. The proposed resolution submitted by the Secretariat seeks to amend the marking requirements to reflect uniform marking only of items of primary economic importance. The resolution also recommends that any ranching proposal include details of the marking system, a list of all specimens of primary economic importance and a current inventory of such stocks. The resolution was submitted due to the general belief that the previously designed marking requirements were overly burdensome to commercial traders, unenforceable by national authorities, and otherwise impractical. The United States proposes to support this resolution to create a marking regime which is not only practical and enforceable, but institutes necessary marking controls to implement the ranching requirements that are implemented under the authority of the Convention. 32. Universal Tagging System for the Identification of Crocodilian Skins [Doc. 10.64] No document has yet been received. The United States believes this document will discuss implementation of the resolution on the universal tagging of crocodilian skins, which the United States generally supports. However, the United States will not formulate a final policy position on this issue until the documents are received from the Secretariat. 33. Identification of Corals and Reporting of Coral Trade [Doc. 10.65] This is a United States sponsored resolution. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the United States submission of this resolution. 34. Implementation of Article VII, Paragraph 2: Pre-Convention Specimens [Doc. 10.66] This is a United States sponsored resolution. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997 for a rationale explaining the United States submission of this resolution. 35. Captive Breeding (a) Implementation of Article VII, paragraphs 4 and 5 [Doc. 10.67; Doc. 10.68; Doc. 10.69] The United States submitted documents on captive breeding, and these documents are discussed in the March 27, 1997, Federal Register notice. No additional documents have yet been received. At COP9, the Parties directed the Secretariat, working with the Animals Committee, to prepare a18791 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices new resolution consolidating the various extant resolutions dealing with the determination of whether a specimen is bred-in-captivity, and captive breeding of Appendix I animals for commercial purposes. When relevant documents are received from the Secretariat, the United States will review them and develop further policy positions as warranted. (b) Proposals to Register the First Commercial Captive-Breeding Operation for an Appendix I Animal Species No document has yet been received. Under Conf. 8.15, Parties must submit proposals for inclusion of operations breeding Appendix I species in captivity for commercial purposes. The Secretariat maintains a register of those facilities. Proposals are submitted to the Secretariat, which circulates them to the Parties. When a Party objects to inclusion of a facility in the Secretariat's register, and the objection cannot be resolved by the interested Parties, the proposal is discussed and voted upon by the COP (if the proponent country so wishes). This agenda item will include discussion of pending proposals. 36. Hybrids (a) Amendment to Resolution Conf. 2.13 [Doc. 10.70] This resolution was submitted by Australia and seeks to clarify the position of animal hybrids. In accordance with Conf. 2.13, some hybrids may be subject to CITES provisions, even though they may not be specifically included in the Appendices to the Convention, if one or more of the parent's taxa are listed. Accordingly, if the parents are included on different Appendices, then the requirements of the more restrictive appendix apply. The proposed resolution would modify this system substantially, by noting that a hybridized specimen would only be considered as an Appendix I species if it was the progeny of one or more wild- caught Appendix I specimens. Hybridized specimens which do not meet the criteria would be treated as Appendix II species, and progeny from hybridized parental stock would be treated as if they were not included on any Appendix to the Convention. The United States proposes to oppose this resolution. The United States believes that Conf. 2.13 is effective as written, well balanced in scope, effect, and intent, and needs no revision. By modifying Conf. 2.13 in the manner outlined in this resolution, additional layers of complexity and confusion would be added to the issue of trade in hybrid animal species. In addition,some other important conservation concerns arise from modifying Conf. 2.13 pursuant to the proposed resolution. First, full species in trade could erroneously be declared as hybrids by traders, in which case, effective law enforcement could be difficult. This could be especially significant regarding the trade in birds because of plumage that is highly variable, which may not accurately reflect the parentage of a particular specimen. Second, it is apparent that a hybrid captive-breeding facility may require supplementation of wild-caught parental stock in order to maintain a given level of hybrid specimen productivity. Third, the demand for pure Appendix I specimens will still require the acquisition of wild-caught stock, which may promote the laundering of wild-caught specimens under the guise of being captive-born or captive-bred hybrids. Lastly, if hybrids are not protected by the more restrictive Appendix, deliberate hybridization could increase and serve to dilute available blood lines, thereby increasing pressure on wild populations to provide additional genetic material. Australia, the author of the pending resolution proposal, has concerns over specific species in that country and feels this issue could be satisfactorily addressed with a modification to Conf. 2.13. The United States believes that such concerns could be addressed in a specific listing proposal. b) Regulation of Trade in Animal Hybrids [Doc. 10.71] No document has yet been received. When relevant documentation is received from the Secretariat, the United States will evaluate it and formulate a policy position. 37. Shipments Covered by Customs Carnets [Doc. 10.72] This is a United States sponsored resolution. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the United States submission of this resolution. 38. Frequent Transborder Movements of Personally Owned Live Animals [Doc. 10.73] This resolution, jointly submitted by Switzerland and Germany, calls for the creation of a certificate of ownership to accompany CITES-listed animals frequently crossing international borders. The United States interprets the term personal or household effects in Article VII, paragraph 3, to include personally owned live animals that were acquired in the owner's state of usual residence. Other countries have notincluded live animals in their interpretation of this exemption, and the Secretariat maintains that position based on Conf. 4.12. The issuance of separate permits to people with personally owned live animals that cross international borders frequently (i.e., falconry practitioners, pet owners who travel, etc.) poses technical and administrative burdens. In addition, the Service is concerned with the number of retroactive permits we have had to issue since the United States recognizes the exemption while other countries do not. The United States intends to support the provisions of this resolution. Adoption of this resolution will reduce the administrative burdens to the animal owner and the countries to which the owner enters and exits, while ensuring marking and monitoring of movement to prevent illegal activities. However, despite general support for the provisions of this resolution, the United States believes that there remains a need to clarify the following elements in the resolution: (a) the animals must be accompanied by the owner; (b) the certificate of ownership must be validated by a Party's Customs or other appropriate authorities on import and re-export, and (c) the information on the transit of the animals in question must be recorded in each Party's annual report. In addition, the United States supports adoption of this resolution only if paragraph n) is adopted. This provision is to ensure that the owner not sell or transfer a live animal while outside the owner's usual state of residence under the certificate of ownership. 39. Live Animals in Traveling Circuses [Doc. 10.74] Under CITES Article VII, paragraph 7, a Management Authority may waive the permit requirements for the movement of live animals that are part of a traveling live animal exhibition if the exporter or importer is registered, the animals qualify as pre-Convention or captive-bred, and the animals are humanely transported and maintained. At the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, the Parties adopted Conf. 8.16 to correct technical problems and prevent fraud in the movement of animals that are part of traveling exhibitions. This resolution recommends that Parties issue a pre- Convention or captive-bred certificate for each animal as proof that the animal was registered. The certificates could be issued for three years and would not be collected at the border to allow for multiple shipments. Parties need to mark or identify each specimen.18792 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices This proposed resolution, submitted by the Russian Federation, considers a circus a part of a nation's culture which does not use its animals for primarily commercial purposes. The resolution would grant circuses which are owned or funded by governments a ``Certificate of Circus Animal.'' This certificate could not be issued to private or commercial circuses. The Certificate of Circus Animal would be proof that the circus is registered; that its specimens had been acquired in accordance with CITES; and that an Appendix I specimen that is born to the circus or for an animal acquired by the circus before transfer from Appendix II to Appendix I are of legal origin. This Certificate would be valid for all legal specimens, not just for pre-Convention or captive- bred specimens. The resolution is an attempt to resolve a number of technical problems encountered by circuses. Currently, circuses can obtain certificates for three years under Conf 8.16 for pre- Convention or captive-bred animals. But they need to obtain other permits and certificates under Articles IV and V for Appendix II and III wildlife when pre- Convention or captive-bred requirements are not met. These documents are valid only for six months and cannot be used for multiple shipments, requiring a circus to obtain new re-export documents upon exit from each country. The second problem concerns progeny born to circuses that strictly do not meet Conf. 2.12. This is of particular concern for traditional circus species, such as the Asian elephant, that are long-lived and slow- maturing which have not had time to achieve many F2 specimens. The third problem is the continued use of animals that were owned by circuses when a species is listed in Appendix II and then the species is transferred to Appendix I as happened with the African elephant. These animals that are in the possession of a circus do not qualify as pre- Convention under Conf. 5.11 and so may no longer be used by circuses when traveling to other countries. The United States proposes to oppose the basic premises of this resolution. The United States does not believe that the CITES Parties should treat circuses owned or funded by a country's government differently from circuses that are privately owned. Although the United States recognizes that animals being moved by circuses are to stay in their possession and are not to be sold while the circus is outside its state of usual residence, the United States considers circuses to be conducting activities that are primarily commercial. The United States also does not agreethat circuses should be exempted from the requirements of CITES as long as the Management Authority finds that the animals were legally acquired. This broad general exemption from the provisions of CITES could have serious implications for the conservation of some species. On the other hand, the United States supports the use of a passport-type certificate similar to the Annex presented in the proposed resolution. The United States also recognizes (61 FR 44332) that there are additional technical issues in Conf. 8.16 that could be clarified and looks forward to opportunities to explore these various issues. 40. Transport of Live Specimens [Doc. 10.75] This is a United States sponsored resolution on behalf of the Animals Committee. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the United States submission of this resolution. 41. Designation of Scientific Authorities [Doc. 10.76] This is a United States sponsored resolution. See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the United States submission of this resolution. 42. Standard Nomenclature [Doc. 10.77] No document has yet been received. When relevant documents are received from the Secretariat, the United States will review them and develop a policy position. 43. Information on the Population Status and Threats to Ovis vignei [Doc. 10.78] This is an information document submitted by the Government of Germany discussing the population status and threats to Ovis vignei . The United States proposes to support the effort to resolve the listing status of Ovis vignei and thanks the Government of Germany for presenting this document. 44. Traditional Medicines and CITES [Doc. 10.79 and Doc. 10.80] One of the two documents in this item is a United States submitted discussion paper, ``Flora, Fauna and the Traditional Medicine Community: Working With People To Conserve Wildlife.'' See Federal Register notice of March 27, 1997, for a rationale explaining the United States submission of this document. The other discussion paper, ``Traditional Medicine and CITES: A Discussion of Traditional East AsianMedicine,'' was submitted by the United Kingdom. The United States supports the United Kingdom's discussion points as adjuncts to its own. It is uncertain, however, that a resolution on trade in traditional medicines containing wild species is necessary at this time. The United States agrees with the recommendation advocating traditional medicine community participation in CITES both nationally and internationally. The United States specifically endorses the involvement of traditional medicine communities at the national level in discussions pertinent to traditional practices. The United States also endorses the items which support effective enforcement, research and use of substitutes and alternatives, development of authentication tools for semi-processed and processed medicines, conservation awareness programs, and international commitment to conservation, regulatory and ethical issues. Likewise, the United States supports the United Kingdom's positions on (1) encouraging more effective implementation of Conf. 9.13 and 9.14, (2) encouraging donor support for these issues, and (3) including under Conf. 8.4 the review of measures taken by Parties in their national legislation to control the import, export, possession, sale and use of medicinal products containing animal and plant species. The United States, however, does not intend to support the recommendation of this resolution calling for the convening of a technical workshop to establish priority actions for addressing CITES-species use within the context of traditional medicine. The United States believes that priorities should first be identified at a national level between representatives of traditional medicine communities and animal and plant enforcement and CITES authorities. After the identification of national priorities, identified concerns could then be elevated for discussion within the context of the Conference of the Parties. 45. Financing of the Conservation of Biodiversity and Development of Sustainable Use of Natural Resources [Doc. 10.81] In order to ensure the sustainable use of wildlife resources and to conserve biodiversity, this draft resolution would mandate that the Standing Committee, in liaison with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), the World Conservation Union (IUCN), and each Party, study the terms and conditions under which the establishment of a tax on wildlife specimens could be18793 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices implemented and the allocation of such taxes. It recommends that the issuance of labels on wildlife and its products be subjected to the payment of such a tax. While being supportive of biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of wildlife, the United States intends to oppose adoption of this resolution. The United States opposes the establishment of an international tax on wildlife use. The text of CITES neither obligates or authorizes Parties to levy any tax, whether direct or indirect, on the trade in animal or plant species that are included in the Appendices to the Convention. Nor is there a mechanism provided in CITES that would administer any funds generated from a tax on trade in a manner that would ensure sustainable trade and habitat conservation. Because the text of the Convention does not address the issue of taxation, the United States must oppose the draft resolution on Constitutional grounds. The Congress of the United States, which has exclusive jurisdiction over the passage of any legislation that would levy taxes on United States entities engaged in international trade, has not authorized such taxes to be imposed as part of the implementation of CITES. 46. Development of an Information Management Strategy [Doc. 10.82] The development of an information management strategy by the Secretariat was an item of discussion at the 37th meeting of the Standing Committee. The Secretariat presented a document for consideration by the Committee and described its proposal which involved the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC). The United States supported the Secretariat's efforts to develop a better communication system between its offices and the Parties to facilitate the distribution of Notifications to the Parties and other pertinent information. At the Standing Committee meeting, the United States requested that the Secretariat prepare a list of Parties and their computer needs to assist developing countries in obtaining the necessary computer equipment for an information management system to be put in place. No documents have yet been received from the Secretariat. However, the Secretariat has indicated that it will be preparing a document for COP10 which will include the financial implications of putting this system into place. 47. Inclusion of Higher Taxa [Doc. 10.83] This resolution, submitted by Namibia, recommends that the listing ofhigher taxa on the Appendices to the Convention not be made without considering negative consequences to geographically distinct populations. It also recommends the use of annotations on the Appendices to the Convention so that generalized indicators would be presented according to the conservation status and most appropriate management program for each listed species. The United States proposes to oppose this resolution, but hopes that some of the issues raised can be addressed in the Nomenclature Committee. The United States believes that this resolution presents a system which would lead to a proliferation of confusing split- listings, a provision which is only occasionally appropriate for CITES species. There is already adequate flexibility in the Convention for Parties to make decisions as to how they manage populations of native species listed on the Appendices. In addition Conf. 9.24, Annex 3 (the new listing criteria) already adequately addresses the issues associated with split-listings, and in general, discourages their use. This subject was addressed at COP9 through this resolution, and the submission of this newer resolution does not allow for a fair amount of time for the Parties to implement the terms of 9.24. The subject should not be reconsidered so soon, as the Parties agreed at COP9 that reconsideration of the listing criteria should not occur until COP12, so that there is adequate experience gained with the use of the new listing criteria in 9.24. 48. Proposals Concerning Export Quotas for Specimens of Appendix I or II Species [Doc. 10.84] No document has yet been received. When relevant documentation is received from the Secretariat, the United States will evaluate it and formulate a policy position. XV. Consideration of Proposals for Amendment of Appendices I and II (This Item Consists of Four Subitems) 1. Proposals Submitted Pursuant to Resolution on Ranching [Doc. 10.85] 2. Proposals Resulting from Reviews by the Animals and Plants Committees [Doc. 10.86] 3. Proposals Concerning Export Quotas for Specimens of Appendix I or II Species [Doc. 10.87] 4. Other Proposals [Doc. 10.88] Proposal to amend the appendices have been received, and tentative U.S. negotiating positions on these proposalsare presented in a separate Federal Register notice. XVI. Conclusion of the Meeting 1. Determination of the Time and Venue of the Next Regular Meeting of the Conference of the Parties [Doc. 10.89] No documents have been received from the Secretariat regarding candidates as host government for COP11. The United States favors holding COP11 in a country where all Parties and observers will be admitted without political difficulties. The United States proposes to support the holding of COPs on a biennial basis, or, as in the case of COP10, after an interval of approximately two and one half years. 2.

ACTION: Request for comments. SUMMARY: The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) requires the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and other Federal agencies to set strategic goals, measure performance, and report on results. It requires development, no later than the end of fiscal year 1997, of a 5-year strategic plan, to include the organization's mission statement, identify its long-term strategic goals, and describe how it intends to achieve its goals. The Act also requires that in developing its Strategic Plan, that Reclamation solicit and consider the ideas of those potentially affected by or interested in the Strategic Plan. This notice asks for public comment concerning the development of the Bureau of Reclamation's Strategic Plan for the years 1997\u00b12002. DATES: Comments must be received by May 9, 1997. ADDRESSES : Written comments should be directed to Karen Pedone, GPRA Program Manager, W\u00b16300, Bureau of Reclamation, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Karen Pedone, (202) 208\u00b14972. Copies may be obtained by contacting your local Reclamation office or by calling Karen Pedone. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Statutory Background The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, Public Law 103\u00b162 was enacted to make Federal programs more effective and publicly accountable by targeting results, service quality, and customer satisfaction. Other statutory goals were to improve Congressional decisionmaking and to improve internal management of the Federal Government. Section 306 of title 5, United States Code, requires that Reclamation submitto the Director, Office of Management and Budget, and to the Congress a strategic plan for program activities no later than September 30, 1997. The plan is to contain: (1) A comprehensive mission statement covering the major functions and operations of the agency; (2) General goals and objectives, including outcome-related goals objectives, for the major functions and operations of the agency; (3) A description of how the goals and objectives are to be achieved, including a description of the operational processes, skills and technology, and the human, capital, information, and other resources required to meet those goals and objectives; (4) A description of how the performance goals included in the plan required by section 1115(a) of title 31 shall be related to the general goals and objectives in the strategic plan; (5) An identification of those key factors external to the agency and beyond its control that could significantly affect the achievement of the general goals and objectives; and (6) a description of the program evaluations used in establishing or revising general goals and objectives, with a schedule for future program evaluations. Strategic Plan Summary The Bureau of Reclamation Strategic Plan also provides the framework for Reclamation's implementation of the other parts of the Act, including development of annual performance plans, and annual program performance reports that compare actual performance to the annual goals. Reclamation is the largest water resources management agency in the West, administering or operating 348 reservoirs (with a total storage capacity of 245 million acre-feet), 58 hydroelectric powerplants, and more than 300 recreation sites. With these facilities, Reclamation delivers water to over 31 million people and about 10 million acres of irrigated land or about one-third of the irrigated acreage in the West; generates more than 40 billion kilowatt hours of energy each year, making it the Nation's second largest producer of hydroelectric power and the fifth largest electric producer (based on generating capacity) in the West; provides water-based recreation activities for about 90 million visitors a year; provides water supplies to support habitat for wildlife refuges, migratory waterfowl, anadramous and resident fish, and endangered and threatened species; and provides flood control including $414 million in 1995 in floodcontrol benefits. This number reflects the amount of damages from flooding predicted to have occurred if Reclamation facilities had not been in place. Reclamation projects stimulate an estimated $24 billion in economic activity each year. Benefits in agriculture, recreation, power dependent industries, municipal and industrial water service, and other related areas, including the construction industry, are the direct result of Reclamation management of a finite, but variable natural yearly water supply. These multipurpose benefits generate about $5 billion in State and Federal tax revenues. An estimated 700,000 person- years of employment are produced each year as a result of the Reclamation program. The Reclamation program was created by the Reclamation Act of 1902 to reclaim the arid West and to provide economic stability in the 17 western states by developing irrigation projects. Over time, these single purpose projects gave way to the development and construction of multipurpose water resources projects. Over the past 90 plus years, the Federal Government has invested more than $16 billion in Reclamation projects, 80 percent of which is subject to repayment to the U.S. Treasury (although often without interest). Project beneficiaries pay for annual operation and maintenance costs. In addition, Reclamation is responsible for securing the safety of its dams and ensuring that Reclamation facilities are maintained, operated, and repaired in a manner that assures project purposes are reliably met. With a major network of water supply and power generation facilities in place and settlement of the West accomplished, public interest has shifted to concern for the efficient use of already developed water supplies, the protection of social and environmental values, and the protection of the Federal investment and infrastructure. As a corollary, Reclamation's emphasis has evolved from narrowly focused project development to the broadest aspects of contemporary water and related resources management and protection. The transition from a development emphasis to a resources management orientation has involved several years of introspection and change. In the mid- 1980's, Reclamation undertook an agency-wide assessment and published the findings in a public document: ``Assessment '87 * ** A New Direction for the Bureau of Reclamation.'' That document concluded that Reclamation's18798 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices * * * mission must change from one based on Federally supported construction to one based on effective and environmentally sensitive resource management. Based upon that conclusion and further introspection over the next 4 years, Reclamation adopted a new mission statement in 1992\u00d0a mission statement which will lead us into our second century of service to the Nation. In 1993, Reclamation's ``Blueprint for Reform'' solidified this change in mission by establishing contemporary program priorities, functional realignments, and streamlined operating processes throughout Reclamation. Specifically, the ``Blueprint for Reform'' called for the delegation of decision- making authority to the lowest practical organizational level, reductions in organizational layering and the number of supervisory personnel, streamlining regulations, and revision of program and budget execution processes to reflect the current mission and programs. Collectively, the implementation of these changes would enable Reclamation to become a more efficient and effective agency, that is more responsive to its modern mission and its customers. Strategic Planning Process The Strategic Plan has been developed around a framework of Reclamation's three essential mission objectives, desired long-term outcomes, and 5-year strategic goals linked to more tactical strategies to guide the agency in attaining mission objectives. These strategies will enable Reclamation to implement measurable and demonstrable annual program performance goals. Accomplishments will be measured through the use of 5- year strategic goals and strategies as program measures. Both the 5-year strategic goals and the annual goals will be described in the annual plans. With sufficient resources and the ability to effectively deal with factors beyond the agency's control, the annual goals will be accomplished leading ultimately to the achievement of the progressive levels of 5-year, outcome, and mission goals set forth in the Strategic Plan. In forthcoming annual plans, Reclamation's performance indicators will be used for assessing the results of program activities. They will help Reclamation determine whether it has met its objectives and achieved desired results. Measures may be expressed in the form of outputs\u00d0the more traditional quantitative and qualitative ways of describing work products\u00d0or they may be in the form of outcomes\u00d0 measures designed to show a program'sachievements in light of intended results. In addition to objective, tangible measures of Reclamation-wide performance, the agency will report on selected activities that demonstrate progress. Because much of the on-the- ground mission is focused on managing a finite but highly variable water supply across the 17 western states, Reclamation must consider individual situations as well as the overall picture to understand how well it is managing a finite water supply among competing demands, multiple project purposes, and national and international policies and priorities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : The San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Bay-Delta system) is a critically important part of California's natural environment and economy. In recognition of the serious problems facing the region and the complex resource management decisions that must be made, the state of California and the Federal government are working together to stabilize, protect, restore, and enhance the Bay-Delta system. The State and Federal agencies with management and regulatory18799 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices responsibilities in the Bay-Delta system are working together as CALFED to provide policy direction and oversight for the process. One area of Bay-Delta management includes the establishment of a joint State-Federal process to develop long- term solutions to problems in the Bay- Delta system related to fish and wildlife, water supply reliability, natural disasters, and water quality. The intent is to develop a comprehensive and balanced plan which addresses all of the resource problems. This effort, the CALFED Bay-Delta Program (Program), is being carried out under the policy direction of CALFED. The CALFED Bay- Delta Program is exploring and developing a long-term solution for a cooperative planning process that will determine the most appropriate strategy and actions necessary to improve water quality, restore health to the Bay-Delta ecosystem, provide for a variety of beneficial uses, and minimize Bay-Delta system vulnerability. A group of citizen advisors representing California's agricultural, environmental, urban, business, fishing, and other interests who have a stake in finding long term solutions for the problems affecting the Bay-Delta system has been chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) as the Bay-Delta Advisory Council (BDAC) to advise CALFED on the program mission, problems to be addressed, and objectives for the CALFED Bay-Delta Program. BDAC provides a forum to help ensure public participation, will review reports and other materials prepared by CALFED staff. BDAC has established a subcommittee called the Ecosystem Roundtable to provide input on annual workplans to implement ecosystem restoration projects and programs. Minutes of the meeting will be maintained by the CALFED Bay-Delta Program, Suite 1155, 1416 Ninth Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, and will be available for public inspection during regular business hours, Monday through Friday within 30 days following the meeting.

The notice describes the scope of the grant program and provides information about how to get detailed grant application instructions. Applications should not be submitted without the applicant first obtaining the detailed grant application instructions mentioned later in the notice. Authority for this program may be found in section 21(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 670). DATES: Applications must be received by June 13, 1997. ADDRESSES : Grant applications may be submitted to the OSHA Office of Training and Education, Division of Training and Educational Programs, 1555 Times Drive, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018. FORFURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Ronald Mouw, Chief, Division of Training and Educational Programs, or Helen Beall, Training Specialist, OSHA Office of Training and Education, 1555 Times Drive, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018, telephone (847) 297\u00b14810, e-mail helen.beall@oti.osha.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : The program previously known as the Targeted Training Program is being renamed the Susan Harwood Training Grant Program in memory of Susan Harwood, an OSHA employee who died in 1996. Ms. Harwood, who had a Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology, was an outstanding figure in the world of workplace safety and health. She was a dedicated OSHA employee from 1979 until her death. She spent her last eight years as Director of the Office of Risk Assessment in the Directorate of Health Standards Programs. Ms. Harwood's leadership role in developing standardsto protect the health of workers resulted in the implementation of many requirements that significantly reduced occupational diseases in the workplace. Among others, she was responsible for developing the standards for bloodborne pathogens, cotton dust, benzene, formaldehyde, asbestos and lead in construction, and the guidelines for tuberculosis, all of which have had lasting impact on the health of workers. The Susan Harwood Training Grant Program commemorates her exceptional services to occupational health. What is the Purpose of the Program? Susan Harwood Training Grants provide funds to train workers and employers to recognize, avoid, and prevent safety and health hazards in their workplaces. The program emphasizes three areas. Educating workers and employers in small businesses. A small business has 250 or fewer workers. Training workers and employers about new OSHA standards. Training workers and employers about high risk activities identified by OSHA or as part of an OSHA special emphasis program. Grantees are expected to develop training and/or educational programs that address one of the targets named by OSHA (see below), recruit workers and employers for the training, and conduct the training. Grantees will also be expected to follow-up with people who have been trained to find out what, if any, changes were made to reduce hazards in their workplaces as a result of the training. What are the Training Topics this Year? The purpose of this notice is to announce that funds are available for grants. Each grant application must address one of the following target areas. 1. Safety and health programs for small businesses. OSHA is interested not only in training small businesses about safety and health, but in assisting them to implement safety and health programs. Applications addressing this target should include provisions for following up with trainees to help them put what they have learned to use in their workplaces. A small business is a firm with 250 or fewer employees. 2. Ergonomics. This training should be designed to inform workers and employers about ergonomic hazards, how to recognize them, and how to abate them. 3. Scaffolding. Applications for this topic should provide training in the hazards of scaffolding on construction sites and how to abate them. Training18800 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices should be based on OSHA's scaffolding standard (29 CFR 1926 Subpart L) published on August 30, 1996. 4. Workplace violence. This training should address the prevention of violence in the workplace. In selecting applications for grant award, OSHA will give preference to those that provide training for workers and employers of commercial establishments at risk at night, particularly 24-hour workplaces such as retail stores, gas stations, and restaurants. Who is Eligible to Apply for a Grant? Any nonprofit organization that is not an agency of a State or local government is eligible to apply. However, State or local government supported institutions of higher education are eligible to apply in accordance with 29 CFR 97.4(a)(1). Applicants other than State or local government supported institutions of higher education will be required to submit evidence of nonprofit status, preferably from the IRS. A consortium of two or more eligible applicants is also eligible to apply. Each consortium must have a written agreement that spells out roles and responsibilities for each consortium member and names one member as the lead agency. The lead agency will receive the grant and be responsible for grant administration. What Can Grant Funds be Spent On? Grant funds can be spent on the following. Conducting training. Conducting other activities that reach and inform workers and employers about occupational safety and health hazards and hazard abatement. Developing educational materials for use in the training. Sharing educational materials with others in the industry to which the materials apply. Are There Restrictions on How Grant Funds Can be Spent? OSHA will not provide funding for the following activities. 1. Any activity that is inconsistent with the goals and objectives of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. 2. Training involving workplaces that are not covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Examples include state and local government workers in non-State Plan States and workers covered by section 4(b)(1) of the Act. 3. Production, publication, reproduction or use of training and educational materials, includingnewsletters and instructional programs, that have not been reviewed by OSHA for technical accuracy. 4. Activities that address issues other than recognition, avoidance, and prevention of unsafe or unhealthy working conditions. Examples include workers' compensation, first aid, and publication of materials prejudicial to labor or management. 5. Activities that provide assistance to workers in arbitration cases or other actions against employers, or that provide assistance to employers and/or workers in the prosecution of claims against Federal, State or local governments. 6. Activities that directly duplicate services offered by OSHA, a State under a State Plan, or consultation programs provided by State designated agencies under section 7(c)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. 7. Activities intended to generate membership in the grantee's organization. This includes activities to acquaint nonmembers with the benefits of membership, inclusion of membership appeals in materials produced with grant funds, and membership drives. What Other Grant Requirements are There? 1. OSHA review of educational materials. Educational materials produced by the grantee will be reviewed by OSHA for technical accuracy during development and before final publication. OSHA will also review curriculums and purchased training materials for accuracy before they are used. When grant recipients produce training materials, they will provide copies of completed materials to OSHA before the end of the grant period. OSHA has a lending program that circulates grant-produced audiovisual materials. Grant recipients' audiovisual materials will be included in this lending program. 2. OMB and regulatory requirements. Grantees will be required to comply with the following documents. 29 CFR part 95, which covers grant requirements for nonprofit organizations, including universities and hospitals. These are the Department of Labor regulations implementing OMB Circular A\u00b1110. OMB Circular A\u00b121, which describes allowable and unallowable costs for educational institutions. OMB Circular A\u00b1122, which describes allowable and unallowable costs for other nonprofit organizations.29 CFR part 96 and OMB Circular A\u00b1133, which provide information about audit requirements. 3. Certifications. All applicants will be required to certify to a drug-free workplace in accordance with 29 CFR part 98, to comply with the New Restrictions on Lobbying published at 29 CFR part 93, to make a certification regarding the debarment rules at 29 CFR part 98, and to complete a special lobbying certification. 4. Matching share. The program requires the grantee to provide a matching share. Grant recipients are to provide a minimum of 20% of the total grant budget. This match may be in- kind, rather than a cash contribution. For example, if the Federal share of the grant is $80,000 (80% of the grant), then the matching share will be $20,000 (20% of the grant), for a total grant of $100,000. The matching share may exceed 20%. How are Applications Reviewed and Rated? Grant applications will be reviewed by OSHA staff and the review results presented to the Assistant Secretary who will make the selection of organizations to be awarded grants. Preference will be given to applications that plan to conduct train- the-trainer programs. Applicants are encouraged to include managers and/or supervisors in their training. In general, applications that propose to serve a single employer will not be selected, since OSHA is interested in reaching multiple employers with each grant awarded. The following factors will be considered in evaluating grant applications. 1. Program Design a. The proposed training and education program addresses one of the following targets. i. Safety and health programs for small businesses. ii. Ergonomics. iii. Scaffolding. iv. Workplace violence. b. The proposal plans to train workers and/or employers and clearly states the numbers to be trained. c. The proposal contains a train-the- trainer program, and the numbers to be trained by these trainers are clearly stated. d. The planned activities are appropriate for the workers and/or employers to be trained. e. There is a plan to recruit trainees for the program. f. If the proposal includes developing educational materials, there is a plan for18801 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices making these materials available in the industry to which they apply. g. There is a plan to evaluate the program's effectiveness and this includes plans to follow-up with trainees to see if the training resulted in workplace change. h. The planned work can be accomplished in one year. 2. Program Experience a. The organization applying for the grant has experience with occupational safety and health. b. The organization applying for the grant has experience training adults in work-related subjects. c. The staff to be assigned to the project have experience in (1) occupational safety and health, (2) the specific target chosen, and (3) training adults. d. The organization applying for the grant has experience in recruiting and training the population it proposes to serve under the grant. 3. Administrative Capability a. The applicant organization has had experience managing a variety of programs. b. The applicant organization has administered a number of different Federal and/or State grants over the past five years. c. The application is complete, including forms, budget detail, narrative and workplan, and required attachments. 4. Budget a. The budgeted costs are reasonable. b. The proposed non-Federal share is at least 20% of the total budget. c. The budget complies with Federal cost principles (which can be found in applicable OMB Circulars) and with OSHA budget requirements contained in the grant application instructions. d. The cost per trainee is less than $500 and the cost per training hour is reasonable. In addition to the factors listed above, the Assistant Secretary will take other items into consideration, such as the geographical distribution of the grant programs and the coverage of populations at risk. How much money is available for grants? There is approximately $1,900,000 available for this program. The average Federal award will be $100,000. How Long Are Grants Awarded For? Grants are awarded for twelve-month periods. Grants may be renewed for additional twelve-month periodsdepending on whether there are funds available, there is still a need for the training, and the grantee has performed satisfactorily. How Do I Get a Grant Application Package? Grant application instructions may be obtained from the OSHA Office of Training and Education, Division of Training and Educational Programs, 1555 Times Drive, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018. The application instructions are also available at http://www.osha.gov/ training/. When and Where are Applications to be Sent? The application deadline is 4:30 p.m. Central Time, June 13, 1997. Applications can be mailed to the Division of Training and Educational Programs, OSHA Office of Training and Education, 1555 Times Drive, Des Plaines, IL 60018. Applications will not be accepted by fax. How Will I be Told if My Application Was Selected? Organizations selected as grant recipients will be notified by a representative of the Assistant Secretary, usually from an OSHA Regional Office. An applicant whose proposal is not selected will be notified in writing. Notice that an organization has been selected as a grant recipient does not constitute approval of the grant application as submitted. Before the actual grant award, OSHA will enter into negotiations concerning such items as program components, funding levels, and administrative systems. If the negotiations do not result in an acceptable submittal, the Assistant Secretary reserves the right to terminate the negotiation and decline to fund the proposal.

General Information The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: (1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; (2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/ or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and (3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease to apply as of the date of such change.

Operating Engineers Local 150 Apprenticeship Fund (the Fund), Located in Plainfield, Illinois [Exemption Application No. L\u00b110280] Proposed Exemption The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32826, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the restrictions of section 406(a) and 406(b)(1) and (2) shall not apply to the proposed sale (the Sale) of a certain parcel of improved real property (the Property) from the Fund to International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 150 (Local 150), a party in interest with respect to the Plan provided that the following conditions are met:(1) The fair market value of the Property is established by a qualified and independent real estate appraiser; (2) Local 150 pays the greater of $180,000 or the current fair market value of the Property as of the date of the transaction; (3) The Sale is a one time transaction for cash; and (4) The Fund pays no fees or commissions related to the Sale. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Fund is a welfare plan which is an apprenticeship and training plan with approximately 600 apprentices and 5,494 journeymen. The Fund was established on June 1, 1967. As of December 31, 1995, the fair market value of the Fund's assets was $6,492,242. The Fund sponsors include the Local 150 and other employer associations. 2. The Fund acquired the Property as part of a merger with the Operating Engineers Local 537 Apprenticeship and Re-training Fund on or about October 28, 1992. During this time, the Operating Engineers Local 537 terminated and transferred all of its assets to the Fund. The Property is located in Rock Island, Illinois and consists of an office building on approximately 53 acres of land. The applicant represents that the Property has been leased by the Fund to Local 150 pursuant to Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 76\u00b11 (41 FR 1270, March 26, 1976).1Since 1992, the Fund has received net income from the Property in the amount of $33,461. 3. In March 1993, the Property was appraised at a value of $180,000 by Baecke Appraisers, a qualified independent real estate appraisal firm. The value of the Property was determined by using the market value approach which is defined in the appraisal as the most probable price a property should bring on requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. In April 15, 1996, Mr. Robert Baecke of Baecke Appraisers, updated the appraisal and recertified the value of the Property to be $180,000. Mr. Baecke researched sales of comparable properties in the Property's market area that have occurred since the time of the original appraisal. His analysis consisted of research of data from the multiple listing service, county records, exterior inspections of the properties and conversations with individuals18804 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 2The Department expresses no opinion as to whether the Union Lease satisfied the conditions of PTE 76\u00b11 or PTE 77\u00b110, or whether such lease of office space by the Plan to the Union was exempt from the prohibitions of section 406 of the Act.involved in the transactions. Additionally, Mr. Baecke analyzed the valuation approaches used in the original appraisal, taking into consideration all current data. Mr. Baecke concluded that the Property's appraised value remains $180,000. In this regard, Mr. Baecke represented that the value of the Property at time the Fund acquired the Property was $180,000. The Fund will pay no commissions or fees associated with the Sale. 4. The Fund proposes to sell the Property to Local 150. The Trustees of the Fund have determined that the Fund no longer needs the Property, and wish to sell the Property. Local 150 has offered to purchase the Property for cash at the appraised value of $180,000. 6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (1) The Sale is a one- time transaction for cash, and no commissions will be paid upon the Sale; (2) the Fund will be receiving at least fair market value for the Property as determined by an independent qualified real estate appraiser; and (3) the Fund pays no commissions or fees associated with the Sale.

Joint Apprenticeship Committee of Plumbers Local No. 27 (the Plan), Located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [Application No. L\u00b110366] Proposed Exemption The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 C.F.R. Part 2570, Subpart B (55 F.R. 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act shall not apply to the proposed sale by the Plan of certain improved real property located in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (the Property) to the Local Union No. 27 (the Plumbers Local) of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada, a party in interest with respect to the Plan; provided that the following conditions are met: (A) The Plan does not incur any expenses or suffer any loss with respect to the transaction; and (B) The Plan receives a cash purchase price for the Property of no less than thegreater of (1) the Plan's cost basis in the Property as of the date of the sale, or (2) the fair market value of the Property as of the date of the sale, as determined by an independent, qualified appraiser, and in no event less than $265,597. Summary of Facts and Representations Introduction The Plan's operations are conducted in the Pipe Trades Training Center (the Property), which is owned by the Plan. The Trustees of the Plan have determined that it is no longer economically feasible for the Plan to maintain and operate its own facility, and that the Plan can be operated more efficiently as a tenant in the Property. The Trustees propose to sell the Property to the Union, the members of which are participants in the Plan, and to arrange for the Plan to lease space in the Property from the Union. An exemption is requested to allow the sale transaction under the terms and conditions described herein. 1. The Plan is an apprenticeship training plan providing educational and occupational training for apprentices and journeymen plumbers who are members of the Union. The Plan was created and is maintained pursuant to collective bargaining agreements between the Union and the Mechanical Contractors Association of Western Pennsylvania (the Association), which represents employers of plumbers who are members of the Union. The Plan is administered by a board of six trustees (the Trustees), three of whom are representatives of the Union and three of whom are representatives of the Association and other employers in signed agreements with the Union. As of October 1, 1996, approximately 610 members of the Union were participants in the Plan, which had total assets of approximately $360,080 as of December 31, 1995. 2. Among the assets of the Plan is the Property, a parcel of improved real property located at 104 Montour West Industrial Park in North Fayette Township near Pittsburgh in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The Property consists of 1.29 acres of land improved with a one-story structure (the Building) occupied by the Plan and operated by the Trustees as the Pipe Trades Training Center and ancillary office facility. The Building, which is constructed of cement block on reinforced concrete slab, has a total interior area of 6,948 square feet, consisting of 984 square feet of office space (the Office Space) and the remainder utilized as classrooms, shop, computer, and file room areas. The Office Space is occupied by theUnion, which has leased the Office Space from the Plan since 1987 (the Union Lease). The Trustees and the Union represent that the Union Lease satisfies the requirements of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 76\u00b11 (PTE 76\u00b11, 41, FR 12740, March 26, 1976) Class Exemption 77\u00b110 (PTE 77\u00b110, 42 FR 33918, July 1, 1977), relating to, among other things, a lease of office space by a multiemployer plan to a participating employee organization.2 3. The Property is described legally as lot 113R of the Montour West Industrial Park (the Industrial Park) as recorded with the Recorder's Office of Allegheny County, and it consists of a parcel originally described in the county legal records as lot 113 and one third of an adjacent parcel originally described as lot 112. The Trustees represent that the Plan purchased the original lot 113 from an unrelated party on August 22, 1974, and on December 17, 1975 the Plan sold a one-half interest in original lot 113 to the Joint Apprenticeship Committee of Steamfitters Local Union No. 449 (the Steamfitters Plan), an apprenticeship training plan providing benefits to members of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada, Local Union No. 449 (the Steamfitters Local). Thereafter, the original lot 112 was acquired jointly by the Plan and the Steamfitters Plan from an unrelated party on December 29, 1991. Although the Plumbers Local and the Steamfitters Local are components of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada, the Trustees represent that the Steamfitters Local and the Steamfitters Plan are not parties in interest with respect to the Plan, within the meaning of section 3(14) of the Act, and that the trustees of each plan are independent of and unrelated to each other. The Trustees explain that in many jurisdictions plumbers and steamfitters are members of the same local union, with referrals for work based on a determination of whether water or steam pipes are involved. In the Pittsburgh/Western Pennsylvania area, however, the Trustees maintain that there was historically substantial employment in the steel mills and factories for steamfitters, and consequently, two separate local unions18805 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 3In this proposed exemption the Department expresses no opinion as to whether the Plan Lease will meet the requirements of PTE 78\u00b16.emerged, one representing steamfitters and one representing plumbers. Because the training for apprentices in each local union is similar, and because each local union had similar needs in a training facility, the trustees of the apprenticeship plans of each local union agreed to share the same training facility for their apprenticeship programs. In this context, the two plans jointly owned the original lot 113, on which the Building is situated, and the adjacent original lot 112, an unimproved lot utilized for parking space. In 1987, the trustees of the Steamfitters Plan determined to commence arrangements for a movement of the operations of that plan to a separate training facility in Pittsburgh. The trustees of the Steamfitters Plan then transferred that plan's one-half interest in lots 113 and 112 to the Plan, by deed dated January 9, 1987. (The Steamfitters Plan continued to utilize facilities on the Property as a tenant until that plan acquired its own building in 1993.) Subsequently, on June 1990, the legal records for the Industrial Park were revised to provide that two thirds of lot 112 was redesignated as lot 111R and the remaining one third of lot 112 was combined with lot 113 and redesignated as lot 113R. The Trustees sold lot 111R to an unrelated party in 1990, and lot 113R remains the legal designation of the Property. According to Daniel F. Smith, IFA (Smith), a professional independent real estate appraiser in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Property had a fair market value of $246,000 as of June 13, 1996. The Plan's actual cost basis in the Property is $265,597, as determined as of May 14, 1996 by the certified public accounting firm of R.S. Cumberledge & Associates (Cumberledge) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 4. The Trustees represent that it is not economically feasible for the Plan to continue maintaining the Property while continuing to provide a quality training program for the Union's members. The Trustees state that recent financial statements indicate a declining balance of reserves in the assets of the Plan, which is operating at a deficit due to increasing Building maintenance and related expenses. The Trustees represent that employer contributions to the Plan and rents paid by the Union to the Plan are not sufficient to cover escalating costs of maintaining the Property, even though such employer contributions have increased pursuant to collective bargaining and the Trustees represent that the rentals paid by the Union are in excess of the Building's fair marketrental value as indicated by Smith's appraisal. The Trustees are concerned that the Plan's continued ownership of the Property will threaten the availability of funds for instructor salaries, equipment, and training program operations. The Trustees represent that they have determined that the Plan would be able to operate its training program more economically as a tenant, rather than an owner, in the Property. 5. Accordingly, the Trustees and representatives of the Union propose that the Union purchase the Property from the Plan and are requesting an exemption for such transaction under the terms and conditions described herein. The Union will pay the Plan a cash purchase price for the Property in the amount of no less than the greater of (a) the Plan's cost basis in the Property as of the date of the sale, or (b) the Property's fair market value as of the sale date as determined by Smith in an update of his appraisal of June 13, 1996, and in no event less than $265,597, which was the Plan's cost basis in the Property as determined by Cumberledge as of May 14, 1996. The Plan will incur no costs related to the transaction. 6. Commencing with the Union's purchase of the Property, it is proposed that the Plan will continue to utilize the Property as its training facility by leasing from the Union the same space in the Property which the Plan has utilized prior to the purchase transaction. The Union and the Trustees represent that this lease of space in the Property from the Union (the Plan Lease) will meet the requirements of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 78\u00b16 (PTE 78\u00b16, 43 FR 23024, May 30, 1978), relating to, among other things, a lease of real property by an employee organization to a related apprenticeship training plan.3In addition to other requirements, the conditions of PTE 78\u00b1 6 require the Plan Lease to be on terms at least as favorable to the plan as an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party would be, and the Plan Lease must be appropriate and helpful in carrying out the purposes for which the plan is established or maintained. The Trustees represent that the Plan Lease will satisfy these and all other conditions of PTE 78\u00b16 and that the Plan Lease will enable the Plan to terminate the lease arrangement with sixty days written notice to the Union. The Trustees represent that if the exemption is granted, the Plan Lease will be executed between the Plan andthe Union immediately after the sale transaction is consummated and the Plan's use of the Property will continue uninterrupted. 7. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (1) The transaction will be a one-time transaction for cash; (2) The Plan will receive a purchase price for the Property which is no less than the greater of the Plan's cost basis in the Property or the Property's fair market value as of the date of the transaction; (3) The Plan will incur no expenses with respect to the transaction; and (4) The transaction will enable the Plan to reduce its total expenses and to operate more efficiently.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the Plan), Located in Curwensville, Pennsylvania [Application No. D\u00b110385] Proposed Exemption The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed sale by the Plan of an individual life insurance policy (the Policy) to the Howes Leather Company, Inc. (the Employer), the sponsor of the Plan; provided that the following conditions are satisfied: (A) All terms and conditions of the transaction are at least as favorable to the Plan as those which the Plan could obtain in arm's-length transactions with unrelated parties; (B) The Plan receives a purchase price for the Policy of no less than the greater of (1) the fair market value of the Policy as of the sale date, or (2) Policy's cash surrender value (as described below) as of the sale date; (C) The Plan does not incur any expenses or suffer any loss with respect to the transaction; and (D) In the event the Employer recovers with respect to the Policy a total amount in excess of the purchase price paid to the Plan for the Policy, such excess18806 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 4The Department expresses no opinion as to whether the Loan satisfied the conditions of class exemption PTE 80\u00b126.amount shall be distributed prorata among the participants of the Plan. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plan is a defined contribution employee stock ownership plan with 32 participants and total assets of approximately $465,168 as of February 16, 1996. The Plan is sponsored by the Employer, Howes Leather Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation engaged in the business of leather processing in the city of Curwensville, Pennsylvania. The trustees of the Plan are James M. Fitzgibbons and Barry I. Getto, each of whom is an officer, director and shareholder of the Employer. The Plan invests primarily in common stock of the Employer, which constituted approximately 92 percent of the Plan's assets as of February 16, 1996. 2. The Employer represents that the Plan has been terminated and that distribution of Plan assets was completed in April 1996. Although the Plan is an individual-account employee stock ownership plan, at the time of the Plan's termination date there remained in the Plan one general asset in which all Plan participants held undivided pro-rata interests: the Policy. The Policy is an individual life insurance policy issued by the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company (the Insurer) on the life of Harry J. Widney, a former participant in the Plan who had terminated participation in the Plan and received full payment of Plan benefits many years prior to the Plan termination. The Employer represents that Mr. Widney had been a shareholder of the Employer and that the Plan had acquired the Policy to provide the Plan with assets to purchase Employer stock from his estate in the event of his death. When Mr. Widney left the Employer's business and terminated his participation in the Plan during the Plan year commencing July 1, 1982, his account balance in the Plan was distributed to him in the form of Employer stock. The Employer represents that Mr. Widney was offered the Policy but refused to accept it. As a result, the Policy was retained as a general asset of the Plan. With an original face value of $50,000 and paid-up additions totaling $7,998, the Policy has a total face value of $57,998. The Employer represents that upon termination of the Plan, the Trustees were unable to liquidate the Policy, by surrendering it for its cash surrender value, because the Insurer is in rehabilitation proceedings (the Rehabilitation) which have rendered the Policy frozen and inaccessible. The Employer represents that it is uncertain when the Rehabilitation will be resolvedto enable the cash surrender of the Policy by the Plan and that, due to the current status of the Insurer, the ability of the Insurer to pay the full value of the Policy is in question. 3. The Employer represents that upon termination of the Plan, the Trustees undertook to make prompt distributions to all Plan participants of their respective benefits from the Plan, and that they did not wish to delay distribution until resolution of the Rehabilitation. Accordingly, in order to enable the Plan to proceed with complete distributions, the Employer represents that it made an interest-free loan to the Plan (the Loan) in the amount of cash which the Plan would have realized from a cash surrender of the Policy on the Termination Date. The Loan proceeds were distributed pro rata among all participants in the Plan as of the Termination Date. The Loan was in the amount of $34,044.77, which was the cash surrender value of the Policy upon the termination of the Plan as determined by the Insurer. The Employer represents that the Loan satisfied the requirements of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 80\u00b126 (PTE 80\u00b126, 45 FR 35040, May 23, 1980), relating to interest-free loans to a plan for, among other things, the payment of benefits.4The Policy remains an asset in the Plan's trust even though distribution to Plan participants has been completed. 4. In order to complete the liquidation of the Plan, the Employer now proposes to purchase the Policy from the Plan so that the last remaining Plan asset may be liquidated and the Plan's trust may be dissolved, and the Employer is requesting an exemption for such transaction under the terms and conditions described herein. The Employer proposes to purchase the Policy from the Plan for a purchase price in the amount of the Loan, and to consummate the purchase transaction by means of canceling the Loan in exchange for the Policy. Accordingly, the purchase price for the Policy will be $34,044.77, the Policy's cash surrender value as of the date of Plan termination, which was the same amount of cash which the Plan would have realized from a cash surrender of the Policy if the Rehabilitation proceedings had not prevented the cash surrender of the Policy upon the Plan termination. The Plan will not incur any expenses with respect to the transaction. 5. Upon cancellation of the Loan, the Policy will be transferred to theEmployer, and thereafter the Employer will be entitled to amounts due the holder of the Policy under its terms and conditions. The Employer represents that due to the Rehabilitation and the financial condition of the Insurer, it is questionable whether the Employer will ever recover the cash surrender value of the Policy, and it is unlikely the Employer will ever recover any amounts in excess of the amount the Employer is paying the Plan for the Policy. Nonetheless, the Employer has agreed that in the event it receives total proceeds from the Policy in excess of the amounts paid the Plan as purchase price for the Policy, such additional amounts will be distributed pro rata among Plan participants with active accounts in the Plan as of the date of the Plan termination. 6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (a) The transaction will enable the completed termination of the Plan and dissolution of the Plan trust; (b) The Plan will not incur any expenses with respect to the transaction; (c) The purchase price of the Policy will be its cash surrender value as of the date of Plan termination as determined by the Insurer; (d) The transaction will include the Employer's cancellation of the Plan's obligations under the Loan; and (e) Any proceeds from the Policy received by the Employer in excess of the purchase price will be distributed among the Plan's participants with active accounts as of the Termination Date.

Pension Plan for Salaried Employees (the Plan), Located in Keokuk, Iowa [Application No. D\u00b110390] Proposed Exemption The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of section 406(a) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code, shall not apply to (1) the proposed loan to the Plan by Aon Consulting, Inc. (Aon Consulting), in connection with certain excess18807 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 5PTCE 80\u00b126 provides an exemption, under certain conditions, from section 406(a)(1) (B) and (D) and section 406(b)(2) of the Act and the taxes imposed by section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (B) and (D) of the Code, for interest-free loans by a party in interest or disqualified person to an employee benefit plan. 6The Department notes the applicant's representation that the figure of $50,640 is based upon an assumed 18.8% return, which was the Plan's actual investment experience for the period from March 18, 1994 to December 31, 1995. 7The Department notes the applicant's representation that the Plan's lost opportunity costs for the period from January 1, 1996 to the effective date of this exemption will be calculated based upon an assumed rate of return which is equal to the Plan's actual investment experience for that period.distributions (the Overpayments) that Aon Consulting inadvertently caused to be made under the Plan, and (2) the potential repayment of the loan by the Plan to Aon Consulting. This proposed exemption is subject to the following conditions: (1) The Plan pays no interest nor incurs any other expense relating to the loan; (2) The loan amount covers the Overpayments, plus lost opportunity costs attributable to the Overpayments; (3) Any repayment of the loan is restricted solely to the amount, if any, recovered by the Plan with respect to the Overpayments in litigation or otherwise; and (4) A qualified, independent fiduciary for the Plan has reviewed the terms and conditions of the loan on behalf of the Plan and determined that such terms and conditions are in the best interests of and appropriate for the Plan. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plan is a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by Roquette America, Inc. (the Employer). The Employer, a Delaware corporation, is engaged in the production of corn sweeteners for use in foods. As of December 29, 1995, the Plan had total assets of approximately $14,203,379.29. As of July 18, 1996, the Plan had approximately 334 participants and beneficiaries. The trustee of the Plan is the Northern Trust Company (Northern Trust). 2. Aon Consulting, a Pennsylvania corporation, performs actuarial and recordkeeping services for the Plan and other services for the Employer. In 1994, Aon Consulting actuaries miscalculated the value of the accrued benefits of two Plan participants (the Participants), both former officers of the Employer, and, as a consequence, caused the Plan to overpay the Participants upon the termination of their employment. One Participant's lump sum payment was calculated at $412,719.32 instead of $238,843.17 (overstated by $173,876.15). The other Participant's lump sum payment was calculated at $222,722.31 instead of $127,419.26 (overstated by $95,303.05). The applicant represents that the Plan's benefit formula was one of extraordinary complexity and that the errors were not noticed before the inflated benefit payments were made to the Participants on March 18, 1994. Aon Consulting discovered the errors in May, 1994, and reported them to Northern Trust in June, 1994. In August, 1994, the Employer informed each of the Participants of the errors by registered mail and requestedimmediate return of the Overpayments. Separately, each Participant has refused. Repeated subsequent requests, both in writing and by telephone, for return of the Overpayments have yielded no result. 3. Aon Consulting proposes to make the Plan whole by making an interest- free loan to the Plan for $269,179, the amount of the Overpayments, plus lost opportunity costs attributable to the Overpayments. Among other reasons, because the loan is to be secured by the possible recovery of the Overpayments by the Plan, the loan is outside the scope of relief provided by Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 80\u00b126 (PTCE 80\u00b126, 45 FR 28545, April 29, 1980).5 The loan amount will include an additional $50,640 to make up for the Plan's lost opportunity costs for the period from March 18, 1994, the date of occurrence of the Overpayments, to December 31, 1995, for a subtotal of $319,819.6The loan amount will also include an amount yet to be determined to provide the Plan with a rate of investment return on the $319,819, for the period from January 1, 1996 to the effective date of this exemption.7The loan will be evidenced by a promissory note and the loan proceeds paid to the Plan within 30 days of publication in the Federal Register of the notice of the grant of this exemption. The loan will be repaid only to the extent of any amount recovered by the Plan with respect to the Overpayments. Northern Trust will continue to cooperate with Aon Consulting in pursuing recovery of the Overpayments, including, if necessary, the commencement of litigation against the Participants and their respective heirs, estates, executors, administrators, or other personal representatives, in the name of the Plan. Aon Consulting will fund all activities relating to recovery of the Overpayments. In consideration for the loan, the Employer, Northern Trust, and the Plan will release AonConsulting from any further claims that they may have arising from the Overpayments. The costs of this exemption application will be borne by Aon Consulting. 5. The interests of the Plan with respect to the loan are represented by Northern Trust, acting as an independent fiduciary for the Plan. In a letter from Richard W. Long, Trust Officer, dated March 17, 1997, Northern Trust represents that it is unrelated to and independent of both Aon Consulting and the Employer. Northern Trust further represents that it has extensive experience as a fiduciary under the Act, that it is knowledgeable as to the subject transactions, and that it has reviewed the terms and conditions of the loan on behalf of the Plan and determined that such terms and conditions are in the best interests of and appropriate for the Plan. Specifically, Northern Trust notes that the Plan is guaranteed to be made whole by Aon Consulting by virtue of the interest-free loan (which covers the full amount of the Overpayments, plus interest), and is thus able to avoid the legal costs and uncertainties associated with recouping the Overpayments through alternate means. The potential repayment obligation on the part of the Plan serves the legitimate purpose of preventing a ``double recovery'' by the Plan. 6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (1) The Plan will pay no interest nor incur any other expense relating to the loan; (2) the loan will enable the Plan to immediately recover the amount of the Overpayments, including appropriate interest; (3) any repayment of the loan will be restricted solely to the amount, if any, recovered by the Plan with respect to the Overpayments in litigation or otherwise; and (4) Northern Trust, acting as an independent fiduciary for the Plan, has reviewed the terms and conditions of the loan on behalf of the Plan and determined that such terms and conditions are in the best interests of and appropriate for the Plan.

II. General Conditions A. The relief provided under Part I is available only if the following conditions are met: (1) The acquisition of certificates by a plan is on terms (including the certificate price) that are at least as favorable to the plan as they would be in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (2) The rights and interests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced by other certificates of the same trust; (3) The certificates acquired by the plan have received a rating at the time of such acquisition that is in one of the three highest generic rating categories from either Standard & Poor's18809 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 11It is the Department's view that the definition of ``trust'' contained in III.B. includes a two-tier structure under which certificates issued by the first trust, which contains a pool of receivables described above, are transferred to a second trust which issues securities that are sold to plans. However, the Department is of the further view that, since the exemption provides relief for the direct or indirect acquisition or disposition of certificates that are not subordinated, no relief would be available if the certificates held by the second trust were subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced by other certificates issued by the first trust.Structured Rating Group (S&P's), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. (D & P) or Fitch Investors Service, L.P. (Fitch); (4) The trustee is not an affiliate of any member of the Restricted Group. However, the trustee shall not be considered to be an affiliate of a servicer solely because the trustee has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the servicer pursuant to the terms of a pooling and servicing agreement providing for such succession upon the occurrence of one or more events of default by the servicer; (5) The sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters in connection with the distribution or placement of certificates represents not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting or placing the certificates; the sum of all payments made to and retained by the sponsor pursuant to the assignment of obligations (or interests therein) to the trust represents not more than the fair market value of such obligations (or interests); and the sum of all payments made to and retained by the servicer represents not more than reasonable compensation for the servicer's services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement of the servicer's reasonable expenses in connection therewith; and (6) The plan investing in such certificates is an ``accredited investor'' as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. B. Neither any underwriter, sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer, nor any obligor, unless it or any of its affiliates has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the plan assets used by a plan to acquire certificates, shall be denied the relief provided under Part I, if the provision of subsection II.A.(6) above is not satisfied with respect to acquisition or holding by a plan of such certificates, provided that (1) such condition is disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum; and (2) in the case of a private placement of certificates, the trustee obtains a representation from each initial purchaser which is a plan that it is in compliance with such condition, and obtains a covenant from each initial purchaser to the effect that, so long as such initial purchaser (or any transferee of such initial purchaser's certificates) is required to obtain from its transferee a representation regarding compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, any such transferees will be required tomake a written representation regarding compliance with the condition set forth in subsection II.A.(6) above. III. Definitions For purposes of this exemption: A. Certificate means: (1) a certificate\u00d0 (a) that represents a beneficial ownership interest in the assets of a trust; and (b) that entitles the holder to pass- through payments of principal, interest, and/or other payments made with respect to the assets of such trust; or (2) a certificate denominated as a debt instrument\u00d0 (a) that represents an interest in a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (REMIC) within the meaning of section 860D(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and (b) that is issued by and is an obligation of a trust; with respect to certificates defined in (1) and (2) above for which NISI or any of its affiliates is either (i) the sole underwriter or the manager or co-manager of the underwriting syndicate, or (ii) a selling or placement agent. For purposes of this exemption, references to ``certificates representing an interest in a trust'' include certificates denominated as debt which are issued by a trust. B. Trust means an investment pool, the corpus of which is held in trust and consists solely of: (1) either (a) secured consumer receivables that bear interest or are purchased at a discount (including, but not limited to, home equity loans and obligations secured by shares issued by a cooperative housing association); (b) secured credit instruments that bear interest or are purchased at a discount in transactions by or between business entities (including, but not limited to, qualified equipment notes secured by leases, as defined in section III.T); (c) obligations that bear interest or are purchased at a discount and which are secured by single-family residential, multi-family residential and commercial real property (including obligations secured by leasehold interests on commercial real property); (d) obligations that bear interest or are purchased at a discount and which are secured by motor vehicles or equipment, or qualified motor vehicle leases (as defined in section III.U); (e) guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates, as defined in 29 CFR 2510.3\u00b1101(i)(2);(f) fractional undivided interests in any of the obligations described in clauses (a)\u00b1(e) of this section B.(1);11 (2) property which had secured any of the obligations described in subsection B.(1); (3) undistributed cash or temporary investments made therewith maturing no later than the next date on which distributions are to made to certificateholders; and (4) rights of the trustee under the pooling and servicing agreement, and rights under any insurance policies, third-party guarantees, contracts of suretyship and other credit support arrangements with respect to any obligations described in subsection B.(1).

C. Underwriter means: (1) NISI; (2) any person directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by or under common control with NISI; or (3) any member of an underwriting syndicate or selling group of which NISI or a person described in (2) is a manager or co-manager with respect to the certificates.

F. Subservicer means an entity which, under the supervision of and on behalf of the master servicer, services loans contained in the trust, but is not a party to the pooling and servicing agreement. G. Servicer means any entity which services loans contained in the trust, including the master servicer and any subservicer. H. Trustee means the trustee of the trust, and in the case of certificates which are denominated as debt instruments, also means the trustee of the indenture trust. I. Insurer means the insurer or guarantor of, or provider of other credit support for, a trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person is not an insurer solely because it holds securities representing an interest in a trust which are of a class subordinated to certificates representing an interest in the same trust. J. Obligor means any person, other than the insurer, that is obligated to make payments with respect to any obligation or receivable included in the trust. Where a trust contains qualified motor vehicle leases or qualified equipment notes secured by leases, ``obligor'' shall also include any owner of property subject to any lease included in the trust, or subject to any lease securing an obligation included in the trust.

M. Affiliate of another person includes: (1) Any person directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such other person; (2) Any officer, director, partner, employee, relative (as defined in section3(15) of the Act), a brother, a sister, or a spouse of a brother or sister of such other person; and (3) Any corporation or partnership of which such other person is an officer, director or partner. N. Control means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a person other than an individual. O. A person will be ``independent'' of another person only if: (1) such person is not an affiliate of that other person; and (2) the other person, or an affiliate thereof, is not a fiduciary who has investment management authority or renders investment advice with respect to any assets of such person. P. Sale includes the entrance into a forward delivery commitment (as defined in section Q below), provided: (1) The terms of the forward delivery commitment (including any fee paid to the investing plan) are no less favorable to the plan than they would be in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (2) The prospectus or private placement memorandum is provided to an investing plan prior to the time the plan enters into the forward delivery commitment; and (3) At the time of the delivery, all conditions of this exemption applicable to sales are met. Q. Forward delivery commitment means a contract for the purchase or sale of one or more certificates to be delivered at an agreed future settlement date. The term includes both mandatory contracts (which contemplate obligatory delivery and acceptance of the certificates) and optional contracts (which give one party the right but not the obligation to deliver certificates to, or demand delivery of certificates from, the other party). R. Reasonable compensation has the same meaning as that term is defined in 29 CFR 2550.408c\u00b12. S. Qualified Administrative Fee means a fee which meets the following criteria: (1) the fee is triggered by an act or failure to act by the obligor other than the normal timely payment of amounts owing in respect of the obligations; (2) the servicer may not charge the fee absent the act or failure to act referred to in (1); (3) the ability to charge the fee, the circumstances in which the fee may be charged, and an explanation of how the fee is calculated are set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement; and (4) the amount paid to investors in the trust will not be reduced by the amount of any such fee waived by the servicer.T. Qualified Equipment Note Secured By A Lease means an equipment note: (1) which is secured by equipment which is leased; (2) which is secured by the obligation of the lessee to pay rent under the equipment lease; and (3) with respect to which the trust's security interest in the equipment is at least as protective of the rights of the trust as would be the case if the equipment note were secured only by the equipment and not the lease. U. Qualified Motor Vehicle Lease means a lease of a motor vehicle where: (1) The trust holds a security interest in the lease; (2) The trust holds a security interest in the leased motor vehicle; and (3) The trust's security interest in the leased motor vehicle is at least as protective of the trust's rights as would be the case if the trust consisted of motor vehicle installment loan contracts. V. Pooling and Servicing Agreement means the agreement or agreements among a sponsor, a servicer and the trustee establishing a trust. In the case of certificates which are denominated as debt instruments, ``Pooling and Servicing Agreement'' also includes the indenture entered into by the trustee of the trust issuing such certificates and the indenture trustee. W. NISI means Norwest Investment Services, Inc. and its affiliates. The Department notes that this proposed exemption is included within the meaning of the term ``Underwriter Exemption'' as it is defined in section V(h) of Prohibited Transaction Exemption 95\u00b160 (60 FR 35925, July 12, 1995), the Class Exemption for Certain Transactions Involving Insurance Company General Accounts at 35932. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. NISI is the wholly-owned, separately capitalized investment banking subsidiary of Norwest Corporation (Norwest), a diversified financial services company which was incorporated in Delaware and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. On September 30, 1996 Norwest's consolidated assets were approximately $78 billion. The principal executive offices of Norwest are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As of September 30, 1996, Norwest had subsidiary banks located in 16 states. In addition, non-bank subsidiaries of Norwest offer insurance, securities brokerage services, investment banking and venture capital investment, and mortgage banking and consumer finance.18811 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, /Notices 12The Department notes that PTE 83\u00b11 [48 FR 895, January 7, 1983], a class exemption for mortgage pool investment trusts, would generally apply to trusts containing single-family residential mortgages, provided that the applicable conditions of PTE 83-1 are met. NISI requests relief for single- family residential mortgages in this exemption because it would prefer one exemption for all trusts of similar structure. However, NISI has stated that it may still avail itself of the exemptive relief provided by PTE 83\u00b11. 13Guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates are mortgage-backed securities with respect to which interest and principal payable is guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), or the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). The Department's regulation relating to the definition of plan assets (29 CFR 2510.3\u00b1101(i)) provides that where a plan acquires a guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificate, the plan's assets include the certificate and all of its rights with respect to such certificate under applicable law, but do not, solely by reason of the plan's holding of such certificate, include any of the mortgages underlying such certificate. The applicant is requesting exemptive relief for trusts containing guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates because the certificates in the trusts may be plan assets. 14Trust assets may also include obligations that are secured by leasehold interests on residential real property. See PTE 90\u00b132 involving Prudential- Bache Securities, Inc. (55 FR 23147, June 6, 1990 at 23150).15It is the view of the Department that section III.B.(4) includes within the definition of the term ``trust'' rights under any yield supplement or similar arrangement which obligates the sponsor or master servicer, or another party specified in the relevant pooling and servicing agreement, to supplement the interest rates otherwise payable on the obligations described in section III.B.(1), in accordance with the terms of a yield supplement arrangement described in the pooling and servicing agreement, provided that such arrangements do not involve swap agreement or other notional principal contracts.Norwest Mortgage, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Norwest headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, is one of the largest mortgage banking originators in the United States, with offices in all 50 states. Norwest Financial Services, Inc. (NFI) and its subsidiaries engage in consumer finance activities in each of the 50 states, the Caribbean and Central America and Canada. NFI is also an indirect wholly- owned subsidiary of Norwest. Subsidiaries of NFI also engage in data processing activities for other consumer finance companies. Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. (the Bank), a separate wholly-owned subsidiary of Norwest, is engaged in banking and related activities and is the largest bank in the banking group. At September 30, 1996, the Bank had total assets of $17.1 billion. The principal executive offices of the Bank are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The banking group also includes ten other commercial banks and one federal savings bank, located in 10 states, exceeded $2 billion dollars in total assets as of September 30, 1996. NISI was incorporated in 1984. It maintains its principal place of business in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and has branches in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming, as well as the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area. NISI is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers and a primary dealer in U.S. Treasury securities. NISI underwrites and deals in corporate debt securities, municipal securities, high-yield securities and asset-backed securities, provides private placement and corporate finance advisory services, including merger and acquisition advisory services, publishes research on a wide range of securities and issuers, and engages in syndication, arranging and trading of bank loans. NISI has experience in asset securitizations. NISI's participation in securitization transactions includes the underwriting of public offerings and serving as private placement agent or commercial paper conduit agent/dealer for transactions backed by retail auto receivables and bank and retail credit cards receivables. NISI represents that in 1989 it received Federal Reserve Board authorization to underwrite and deal in commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds, residential mortgage-related securities and consumer receivable- related securities. This order is currently subject to the condition that NISI does not derive more than 10% ofits total gross revenues from such activities. In addition, NISI's affiliates have the power to sell interests in their own assets in the form of asset-backed securities. Trust Assets 2. NISI seeks exemptive relief to permit plans to invest in pass-through certificates representing undivided interests in the following categories of trusts: (1) Single and multi-family residential or commercial mortgage investment trusts;12(2) motor vehicle receivable investment trusts; (3) consumer or commercial receivables investment trusts; and (4) guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificate investment trusts.13 3. Commercial mortgage investment trusts may include mortgages on ground leases of real property. Commercial mortgages are frequently secured by ground leases on the underlying property, rather than by fee simple interests. The separation of the fee simple interest and the ground lease interest is generally done for tax reasons. Properly structured, the pledge of the ground lease to secure a mortgage provides a lender with the same level of security as would be provided by a pledge of the related fee simple interest. The terms of the ground leases pledged to secure leasehold mortgages will in all cases be at least ten years longer than the term of such mortgages.14Trust Structure 4. Each trust is established under a pooling and servicing agreement between a sponsor, a servicer and a trustee. The sponsor or servicer of a trust selects assets to be included in the trust. These assets are receivables which may have been originated by a sponsor or servicer of the trust, an affiliate of the sponsor or servicer, or by an unrelated lender and subsequently acquired by the trust sponsor or servicer.15 On or prior to the closing date, the sponsor acquires legal title to all assets selected for the trust, establishes the trust and designates an independent entity as trustee. On the closing date, the sponsor conveys to the trust legal title to the assets, and the trustee issues certificates representing fractional undivided interests in the trust assets. NISI, alone or together with other broker-dealers, acts as underwriter or placement agent with respect to the sale of the certificates. All of the public offerings of certificates presently contemplated are to be underwritten by NISI on a firm commitment basis. In addition, NISI anticipates that it may privately place certificates on both a firm commitment and an agency basis. NISI may also act as the lead underwriter for a syndicate of securities underwriters. Certificateholders will be entitled to receive monthly, quarterly or semi- annual installments of principal and/or interest, or lease payments due on the receivables, adjusted, in the case of payments of interest, to a specified rate\u00d0the pass-through rate\u00d0which may be fixed or variable. When installments or payments are made on a semi-annual basis, funds are not permitted to be commingled with the servicer's assets for longer than would be permitted for a monthly-pay security. A segregated account is established in the name of the trustee (on behalf of certificateholders) to hold funds received between distribution dates. The account is under the sole control of the trustee, who invests the account's assets in short-term securities which have received a rating comparable to the rating assigned to the certificates. In some cases, the servicer18812 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 16It is the Department's understanding that where a plan invests in REMIC ``residual'' interest certificates to which this exemption applies, some of the income received by the plan as a result of such investment may be considered unrelated business taxable income to the plan, which is subject to income tax under the Code. The Department emphasizes that the prudence requirement of section 404(a)(l)(B) of the Act would require plan fiduciaries to carefully consider this and other tax consequences prior to causing plan assets to be invested in certificates pursuant to this exemption.17If a trust issues subordinated certificates, holders of such subordinated certificates may not share in the amount distributed on a pro rata basis with the senior certificateholders. The Department notes that the exemption does not provide relief for plan investment in such subordinated certificates.may be permitted to make a single deposit into the account once a month. When the servicer makes such monthly deposits, payments received from obligors by the servicer may be commingled with the servicer's assets during the month prior to deposit. Usually, the period of time between receipt of funds by the servicer and deposit of these funds in a segregated account does not exceed one month. Furthermore, in those cases where distributions are made semi-annually, the servicer will furnish a report on the operation of the trust to the trustee on a monthly basis. At or about the time this report is delivered to the trustee, it will be made available to certificateholders and delivered to or made available to each rating agency that has rated the certificates. 5. Some of the certificates will be multi-class certificates. NISI requests exemptive relief for two types of multi- class certificates: ``strip'' certificates and ``fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates. Strip certificates are a type of security in which the stream of interest payments on receivables is split from the flow of principal payments and separate classes of certificates are established, each representing rights to disproportionate payments of principal and interest.16 ``Fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates involve the issuance of classes of certificates having different stated maturities or the same maturities with different payment schedules. Interest and/or principal payments received on the underlying receivables are distributed first to the class of certificates having the earliest stated maturity of principal, and/or earlier payment schedule, and only when that class of certificates has been paid in full (or has received a specified amount) will distributions be made with respect to the second class of certificates. Distributions on certificates having later stated maturities will proceed in like manner until all the certificateholders have been paid in full. The only difference between this multi-class pass- through arrangement and a single-class pass-through arrangement is the order in which distributions are made to certificateholders. In each case,certificateholders will have a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying assets. In neither case will the rights of a plan purchasing a certificate be subordinated to the rights of another certificateholder in the event of default on any of the underlying obligations. In particular, if the amount available for distribution to certificateholders is less than the amount required to be so distributed, all senior certificateholders then entitled to receive distributions will share in the amount distributed on a pro rata basis.17 6. The trust will be maintained as an essentially passive entity. Therefore, both the sponsor's discretion and the servicer's discretion with respect to assets included in a trust are severely limited. Pooling and servicing agreements provide for the substitution of receivables by the sponsor only in the event of defects in documentation discovered within a short time after the issuance of trust certificates (within 120 days, except in the case of obligations having an original term of 30 years, in which case the period will not exceed two years). Any receivable so substituted is required to have characteristics substantially similar to the replaced receivable and will be at least as creditworthy as the replaced receivable. In some cases, the affected receivable would be repurchased, with the purchase price applied as a payment on the affected receivable and passed through to certificateholders. Parties to Transactions 7. The originator of a receivable is the entity that initially lends money to a borrower (obligor), such as a home owner or automobile purchaser, or leases property to a lessee. The originator may either retain a receivable in its portfolio or sell it to a purchaser, such as a trust sponsor. Originators of receivables included in the trusts will be entities that originate receivables in the ordinary course of their business, including finance companies for whom such origination constitutes the bulk of their operations, financial institutions for whom such origination constitutes a substantial part of their operations, and any kind of manufacturer, merchant, or service enterprise for whom such origination is an incidental part of its operations. Each trust may contain assets of one or more originators. The originator of thereceivables may also function as the trust sponsor or servicer. 8. The sponsor will be one of three entities: (i) A special-purpose or other corporation unaffiliated with the servicer, (ii) a special-purpose or other corporation affiliated with the servicer, or (iii) the servicer itself. Where the sponsor is not also the servicer, the sponsor's role will generally be limited to acquiring the receivables to be included in the trust, establishing the trust, designating the trustee, and assigning the receivables to the trust. 9. The trustee of a trust is the legal owner of the obligations in the trust. The trustee is also a party to or beneficiary of all the documents and instruments deposited in the trust, and as such is responsible for enforcing all the rights created thereby in favor of certificateholders. The trustee will be an independent entity, and therefore will be unrelated to NISI, the trust sponsor or the servicer. NISI represents that the trustee will be a substantial financial institution or trust company experienced in trust activities. The trustee receives a fee for its services, which will be paid by the servicer or sponsor. The method of compensating the trustee which is specified in the pooling and servicing agreement will be disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the offering of the certificates. 10. The servicer of a trust administers the receivables on behalf of the certificateholders. The servicer's functions typically involve, among other things, notifying borrowers of amounts due on receivables, maintaining records of payments received on receivables and instituting foreclosure or similar proceedings in the event of default. In cases where a pool of receivables has been purchased from a number of different originators and deposited in a trust, the receivables may be ``subserviced'' by their respective originators and a single entity may ``master service'' the pool of receivables on behalf of the owners of the related series of certificates. Where this arrangement is adopted, a receivable continues to be serviced from the perspective of the borrower by the local subservicer, while the investor's perspective is that the entire pool of receivables is serviced by a single, central master servicer who collects payments from the local subservicers and passes them through to certificateholders. Receivables of the type suitable for inclusion in a trust invariably are serviced with the assistance of a computer. After the sale, the servicer18813 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 18The pass-through rate on certificates representing interests in trusts holding leases is determined by breaking down lease payments into ``principal'' and ``interest'' components based on an implicit interest rate.keeps the sold receivables on the computer system in order to continue monitoring the accounts. Although the records relating to sold receivables are kept in the same master file as receivables retained by the originator, the sold receivables are flagged as having been sold. To protect the investor's interest, the servicer ordinarily covenants that this ``sold flag'' will be included in all records relating to the sold receivables, including the master file, archives, tape extracts and printouts. The sold flags are invisible to the obligor and do not affect the manner in which the servicer performs the billing, posting and collection procedures related to the sold receivables. However, the servicer uses the sold flag to identify the receivables for the purpose of reporting all activity on those receivables after their sale to investors. Depending on the type of receivable and the details of the servicer's computer system, in some cases the servicer's internal reports can be adapted for investor reporting with little or no modification. In other cases, the servicer may have to perform special calculations to fulfill the investor reporting responsibilities. These calculations can be performed on the servicer's main computer, or on a small computer with data supplied by the main system. In all cases, the numbers produced for the investors are reconciled to the servicer's books and reviewed by public accountants. The underwriter will be a registered broker-dealer that acts as underwriter or placement agent with respect to the sale of the certificates. Public offerings of certificates are generally made on a firm commitment basis. Private placement of certificates may be made on a firm commitment or agency basis. It is anticipated that the lead and co- managing underwriters will make a market in certificates offered to the public. In some cases, the originator and servicer of receivables to be included in a trust and the sponsor of the trust (although they may themselves be related) will be unrelated to NISI. In other cases, however, affiliates of NISI may originate or service receivables included in a trust or may sponsor a trust. Certificate Price, Pass-Through Rate and Fees 11. In some cases, the sponsor will obtain the receivables from various originators pursuant to existing contracts with such originators under which the sponsor continually buys receivables. In other cases, the sponsorwill purchase the receivables at fair market value from the originator or a third party pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement related to the specific offering of certificates. In other cases, the sponsor will originate the receivables itself. As compensation for the receivables transferred to the trust, the sponsor receives certificates representing the entire beneficial interest in the trust, or the cash proceeds of the sale of such certificates. If the sponsor receives certificates from the trust, the sponsor sells all or a portion of these certificates for cash to investors or securities underwriters. 12. The price of the certificates, both in the initial offering and in the secondary market, is affected by market forces, including investor demand, the pass-through interest rate on the certificates in relation to the rate payable on investments of similar types and quality, expectations as to the effect on yield resulting from prepayment of underlying receivables, and expectations as to the likelihood of timely payment. The pass-through rate for certificates is equal to the interest rate on receivables included in the trust minus a specified servicing fee.18This rate is generally determined by the same market forces that determine the price of a certificate. The price of a certificate and its pass-through, or coupon, rate together determine the yield to investors. If an investor purchases a certificate at less than par, that discount augments the stated pass-through rate; conversely, a certificate purchased at a premium yields less than the stated coupon. 13. As compensation for performing its servicing duties, the servicer (who may also be the sponsor or an affiliate thereof, and receive fees for acting in that capacity) will retain the difference between payments received on the receivables in the trust and payments payable (at the pass-through rate) to certificateholders, except that in some cases a portion of the payments on receivables may be paid to a third party, such as a fee paid to a provider of credit support. The servicer may receive additional compensation by having the use of the amounts paid on the receivables between the time they are received by the servicer and the time they are due to the trust (which time is set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement). The servicer typically willbe required to pay the administrative expenses of servicing the trust, including in some cases the trustee's fee, out of its servicing compensation. The servicer is also compensated to the extent it may provide credit enhancement to the trust or otherwise arrange to obtain credit support from another party. This ``credit support fee'' may be aggregated with other servicing fees, and is either paid out of the interest income received on the receivables in excess of the pass-through rate or paid in a lump sum at the time the trust is established. 14. The servicer may be entitled to retain certain administrative fees paid by a third party, usually the obligor. These administrative fees fall into three categories: (a) prepayment fees; (b) late payment and payment extension fees; and (c) expenses, fees and charges associated with foreclosure or repossession, or other conversion of a secured position into cash proceeds, upon default of an obligation. Compensation payable to the servicer will be set forth or referred to in the pooling and servicing agreement and described in reasonable detail in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the certificates. 15. Payments on receivables may be made by obligors to the servicer at various times during the period preceding any date on which pass- through payments to the trust are due. In some cases, the pooling and servicing agreement may permit the servicer to place these payments in non-interest bearing accounts maintained with itself or to commingle such payments with its own funds prior to the distribution dates. In these cases, the servicer would be entitled to the benefit derived from the use of the funds between the date of payment on a receivable and the pass- through date. Commingled payments may not be protected from the creditors of the servicer in the event of the servicer's bankruptcy or receivership. In those instances when payments on receivables are held in non-interest bearing accounts or are commingled with the servicer's own funds, the servicer is required to deposit these payments by a date specified in the pooling and servicing agreement into an account from which the trustee makes payments to certificateholders. 16. The underwriter will receive a fee in connection with the securities underwriting or private placement of certificates. In a firm commitment underwriting, this fee would consist of the difference between what the underwriter receives for the certificates that it distributes and what it pays the sponsor for those certificates. In a18814 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices private placement, the fee normally takes the form of an agency commission paid by the sponsor. In a best efforts underwriting in which the underwriter would sell certificates in a public offering on an agency basis, the underwriter would receive an agency commission rather than a fee based on the difference between the price at which the certificates are sold to the public and what it pays the sponsor. In some private placements, the underwriter may buy certificates as principal, in which case its compensation would be the difference between what it receives for the certificates that it sells and what it pays the sponsor for these certificates. Purchase of Receivables by the Servicer 17. The applicant represents that as the principal amount of the receivables in a trust is reduced by payments, the cost of administering the trust generally increases, making the servicing of the trust prohibitively expensive at some point. Consequently, the pooling and servicing agreement generally provides that the servicer may purchase the receivables remaining in the trust when the aggregate unpaid balance payable on the receivables is reduced to a specified percentage (usually 5 to 10 percent) of the initial aggregate unpaid balance. The purchase price of a receivable is specified in the pooling and servicing agreement and will be at least equal to: (1) the unpaid principal balance on the receivable plus accrued interest, less any unreimbursed advances of principal made by the servicer; or (2) the greater of (a) the amount in (1) or (b) the fair market value of such obligations in the case of a REMIC, or the fair market value of the receivables in the case of a trust that is not a REMIC. Certificate Ratings 18. The certificates will have received one of the three highest ratings available from either S&P's, Moody's, D&P or Fitch. Insurance or other credit support (such as surety bonds, letters of credit, guarantees, or overcollateralization) will be obtained by the trust sponsor to the extent necessary for the certificates to attain the desired rating. The amount of this credit support is set by the rating agencies at a level that is a multiple of the worst historical net credit loss experience for the type of obligations included in the issuing trust. Provision of Credit Support 19. In some cases, the master servicer, or an affiliate of the master servicer, may provide credit support to the trust (i.e. act as an insurer). In these cases, themaster servicer, in its capacity as servicer, will first advance funds to the full extent that it determines that such advances will be recoverable (a) Out of late payments by the obligors, (b) from the credit support provider (which may be the master servicer or an affiliate thereof) or, (c) in the case of a trust that issues subordinated certificates, from amounts otherwise distributable to holders of subordinated certificates, and the master servicer will advance such funds in a timely manner. When the servicer is the provider of the credit support and provides its own funds to cover defaulted payments, it will do so either on the initiative of the trustee, or on its own initiative on behalf of the trustee, but in either event it will provide such funds to cover payments to the full extent of its obligations under the credit support mechanism. In some cases, however, the master servicer may not be obligated to advance funds but instead would be called upon to provide funds to cover defaulted payments to the full extent of its obligations as insurer. Moreover, a master servicer typically can recover advances either from the provider of credit support or from future payments on the affected assets. If the master servicer fails to advance funds, fails to call upon the credit support mechanism to provide funds to cover delinquent payments, or otherwise fails in its duties, the trustee would be required and would be able to enforce the certificateholders' rights, as both a party to the pooling and servicing agreement and the owner of the trust estate, including rights under the credit support mechanism. Therefore, the trustee, who is independent of the servicer, will have the ultimate right to enforce the credit support arrangement. When a master servicer advances funds, the amount so advanced is recoverable by the master servicer out of future payments on receivables held by the trust to the extent not covered by credit support. However, where the master servicer provides credit support to the trust, there are protections in place to guard against a delay in calling upon the credit support to take advantage of the fact that the credit support declines proportionally with the decrease in the principal amount of the obligations in the trust as payments on receivables are passed through to investors. These safeguards include: (a) There is often a disincentive to postponing credit losses because the sooner repossession or foreclosure activities are commenced, the more value that can be realized on the security for the obligation;(b) The master servicer has servicing guidelines which include a general policy as to the allowable delinquency period after which an obligation ordinarily will be deemed uncollectible. The pooling and servicing agreement will require the master servicer to follow its normal servicing guidelines and will set forth the master servicer's general policy as to the period of time after which delinquent obligations ordinarily will be considered uncollectible; (c) As frequently as payments are due on the receivables included in the trust (monthly, quarterly or semi-annually, as set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement), the master servicer is required to report to the independent trustee the amount of all past-due payments and the amount of all servicer advances, along with other current information as to collections on the receivables and draws upon the credit support. Further, the master servicer is required to deliver to the trustee annually a certificate of an executive officer of the master servicer stating that a review of the servicing activities has been made under such officer's supervision, and either stating that the master servicer has fulfilled all of its obligations under the pooling and servicing agreement or, if the master servicer has defaulted under any of its obligations, specifying any such default. The master servicer's reports are reviewed at least annually by independent accountants to ensure that the master servicer is following its normal servicing standards and that the master servicer's reports conform to the master servicer's internal accounting records. The results of the independent accountants' review are delivered to the trustee; and (d) The credit support has a ``floor'' dollar amount that protects investors against the possibility that a large number of credit losses might occur towards the end of the life of the trust, whether due to servicer advances or any other cause. Once the floor amount has been reached, the servicer lacks an incentive to postpone the recognition of credit losses because the credit support amount thereafter is subject to reduction only for actual draws. From the time that the floor amount is effective until the end of the life of the trust, there are no proportionate reductions in the credit support amount caused by reductions in the pool principal balance. Indeed, since the floor is a fixed dollar amount, the amount of credit support ordinarily increases as a percentage of the pool principal balance during the period that the floor is in effect.18815 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices Disclosure 20. In connection with the original issuance of certificates, the prospectus or private placement memorandum will be furnished to investing plans. The prospectus or private placement memorandum will contain information material to a fiduciary's decision to invest in the certificates, including: (a) Information concerning the payment terms of the certificates, the rating of the certificates, and any material risk factors with respect to the certificates; (b) A description of the trust as a legal entity and a description of how the trust was formed by the seller/servicer or other sponsor of the transaction; (c) Identification of the independent trustee for the trust; (d) A description of the receivables contained in the trust, including the types of receivables, the diversification of the receivables, their principal terms, and their material legal aspects; (e) A description of the sponsor and servicer; (f) A description of the pooling and servicing agreement, including a description of the seller's principal representations and warranties as to the trust assets and the trustee's remedy for any breach thereof; a description of the procedures for collection of payments on receivables and for making distributions to investors, and a description of the accounts into which such payments are deposited and from which such distributions are made; identification of the servicing compensation and any fees for credit enhancement that are deducted from payments on receivables before distributions are made to investors; a description of periodic statements provided to the trustee, and provided to or made available to investors by the trustee; and a description of the events that constitute events of default under the pooling and servicing contract and a description of the trustee's and the investors' remedies incident thereto; (g) A description of the credit support; (h) A general discussion of the principal federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the pass- through securities by a typical investor; (i) A description of the underwriters' plan for distributing the pass-through securities to investors; and (j) Information about the scope and nature of the secondary market, if any, for the certificates. 21. Reports indicating the amount of payments of principal and interest are provided to certificateholders at least as frequently as distributions are made tocertificateholders. Certificateholders will also be provided with periodic information statements setting forth material information concerning the underlying assets, including, where applicable, information as to the amount and number of delinquent and defaulted loans or receivables. 22. In the case of a trust that offers and sells certificates in a registered public offering, the trustee, the servicer or the sponsor will file such periodic reports as may be required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although some trusts that offer certificates in a public offering will file quarterly reports on Form 10\u00b1Q and Annual Reports on Form 10\u00b1K, many trusts obtain, by application to the Securities and Exchange Commission, a complete exemption from the requirement to file quarterly reports on Form 10\u00b1Q and a modification of the disclosure requirements for annual reports on Form 10\u00b1K. If such an exemption is obtained, these trusts normally would continue to have the obligation to file current reports on Form 8\u00b1K to report material developments concerning the trust and the certificates. While the Securities and Exchange Commission's interpretation of the periodic reporting requirements is subject to change, periodic reports concerning a trust will be filed to the extent required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 23. At or about the time distributions are made to certificateholders, a report will be delivered to the trustee as to the status of the trust and its assets, including underlying obligations. Such report will typically contain information regarding the trust's assets, payments received or collected by the servicer, the amount of prepayments, delinquencies, servicer advances, defaults and foreclosures, the amount of any payments made pursuant to any credit support, and the amount of compensation payable to the servicer. Such report also will be delivered to or made available to the rating agency or agencies that have rated the trust's certificates. In addition, promptly after each distribution date, certificateholders will receive a statement prepared by the servicer, paying agent or trustee summarizing information regarding the trust and its assets. Such statement will include information regarding the trust and its assets, including underlying receivables. Such statement will typically contain information regarding payments and prepayments, delinquencies, the remaining amount of the guaranty or other credit support anda breakdown of payments between principal and interest. Forward Delivery Commitments 24. To date, no forward delivery commitments have been entered into by NISI in connection with the offering of any certificates, but NISI may contemplate entering into such commitments. The utility of forward delivery commitments has been recognized with respect to offering similar certificates backed by pools of residential mortgages, and NISI may find it desirable in the future to enter into such commitments for the purchase of certificates. Secondary Market Transactions 25. It is NISI's normal policy to attempt to make a market for securities for which it is lead or co-managing underwriter. NISI anticipates that it will make a market in certificates, although it will have no obligation to do so. Retroactive Relief 26. NISI represents that it has not assumed that retroactive relief would be granted prior to the date of its application, and therefore has not engaged in transactions related to mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities based on such an assumption. However, NISI requests the exemptive relief granted to be retroactive to February 12, 1997, the date of its application, and would like to rely on such retroactive relief for transactions entered into prior to the date exemptive relief may be granted. Summary 27. In summary, the applicant represents that the transactions for which exemptive relief is requested satisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act due to the following: (a) The trusts contain ``fixed pools'' of assets. There is little discretion on the part of the trust sponsor to substitute receivables contained in the trust once the trust has been formed; (b) Certificates in which plans invest will have been rated in one of the three highest rating categories by S&P's, Moody's, D&P or Fitch. Credit support will be obtained to the extent necessary to attain the desired rating; (c) All transactions for which NISI seeks exemptive relief will be governed by the pooling and servicing agreement, which is made available to plan fiduciaries for their review prior to the plan's investment in certificates; (d) Exemptive relief from sections 406(b) and 407 for sales to plans is substantially limited; and18816 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 19In referring to different ``types'' of asset- NISIcked securities, the Department means certificates representing interests in trusts containing different ``types'' of receivables, such as single family residential mortgages, multi-family residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, home equity loans, auto loan receivables, installment obligations for consumer durables secured by purchase money security interests, etc. The Department intends this condition to require that certificates in which a plan invests are of the type that have been rated (in one of the three highest generic rating categories by S&P's, D&P, Fitch or Moody's) and purchased by investors other than plans for at least one year prior to the plan's investment pursuant to the proposed exemption. In this regard, the Department does not intend to require that the particular assets contained in a trustmust have been ``seasoned'' (e.g., originated at least one year prior to the plan's investment in the trust). 20In this regard, we note that the exemptive relief proposed herein is limited to certificates with respect to which NISI or any of its affiliates is either (a) the sole underwriter or manager or co-manager of the underwriting syndicate, or (b) a selling or placement agent. 21The applicant represents that where a trust sponsor is an affiliate of NISI, sales to plans by the sponsor may be exempt under PTE 75\u00b11, Part II (relating to purchases and sales of securities by broker-dealers and their affiliates), if NISI is not a fiduciary with respect to plan assets to be invested in certificates.(e) NISI anticipates that it will make a secondary market in certificates. Discussion of Proposed Exemption I. Differences Between Proposed Exemption and Class Exemption PTE 83\u00b11 The exemptive relief proposed herein is similar provided in PTE 81\u00b1 7 [46 FR 7520, January 23, 1981], Class Exemption for Certain Transactions Involving Mortgage Pool Investment Trusts, amended and restated as PTE 83\u00b11 [48 FR 895, January 7, 1983]. PTE 83\u00b11 applies to mortgage pool investment trusts consisting of interest- bearing obligations secured by first or second mortgages or deeds of trust on single-family residential property. The exemption provides relief from sections 406(a) and 407 for the sale, exchange or transfer in the initial issuance of mortgage pool certificates between the trust sponsor and a plan, when the sponsor, trustee or insurer of the trust is a party-in-interest with respect to the plan, and the continued holding of such certificates, provided that the conditions set forth in the exemption are met. PTE 83\u00b11 also provides exemptive relief from section 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act for the above-described transactions when the sponsor, trustee or insurer of the trust is a fiduciary with respect to the plan assets invested in such certificates, provided that additional conditions set forth in the exemption are met. In particular, section 406(b) relief is conditioned upon the approval of the transaction by an independent fiduciary. Moreover, the total value of certificates purchased by a plan must not exceed 25 percent of the amount of the issue, and at least 50 percent of the aggregate amount of the issue must be acquired by persons independent of the trust sponsor, trustee or insurer. Finally, PTE 83\u00b11 provides conditional exemptive relief from section 406(a) and (b) of the Act for transactions in connection with the servicing and operation of the mortgage trust. Under PTE 83\u00b11, exemptive relief for the above transactions is conditioned upon the sponsor and the trustee of the mortgage trust maintaining a system for insuring or otherwise protecting the pooled mortgage loans and the property securing such loans, and for indemnifying certificateholders against reductions in pass-through payments due to defaults in loan payments or property damage. This system must provide such protection and indemnification up to an amount not less than the greater of one percent of the aggregate principal balance of alltrust mortgages or the principal balance of the largest mortgage. The exemptive relief proposed herein differs from that provided by PTE 83\u00b1 1 in the following major respects: (1) The proposed exemption provides individual exemptive relief rather than class relief; (2) The proposed exemption covers transactions involving trusts containing a broader range of assets than single-family residential mortgages; (3) Instead of requiring a system for insuring the pooled receivables, the proposed exemption conditions relief upon the certificates having received one of the three highest ratings available from S&P's, Moody's, D&P or Fitch (insurance or other credit support would be obtained only to the extent necessary for the certificates to attain the desired rating); and (4) The proposed exemption provides more limited section 406(b) and section 407 relief for sales transactions. II. Ratings of Certificates After consideration of the representations of the applicant and information provided by S&P's, Moody's, D&P and Fitch, the Department has decided to condition exemptive relief upon the certificates having attained a rating in one of the three highest generic rating categories from S&P's, Moody's, D&P or Fitch. The Department believes that the rating condition will permit the applicant flexibility in structuring trusts containing a variety of mortgages and other receivables while ensuring that the interests of plans investing in certificates are protected. The Department also believes that the ratings are indicative of the relative safety of investments in trusts containing secured receivables. The Department is conditioning the proposed exemptive relief upon each particular type of asset- backed security having been rated in one of the three highest rating categories for at least one year and having been sold to investors other than plans for at least one year.19III. Limited Section 406(b) and Section 407(a) Relief for Sales NISI represents that in some cases a trust sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer, and obligor with respect to receivables contained in a trust, or an underwriter of certificates may be a pre-existing party in interest with respect to an investing plan.20In these cases, a direct or indirect sale of certificates by that party in interest to the plan would be a prohibited sale or exchange of property under section 406(a)(1)(A) of the Act.21 Likewise, issues are raised under section 406(a)(1)(D) of the Act where a plan fiduciary causes a plan to purchase certificates where trust funds will be used to benefit a party in interest. Additionally, NISI represents that a trust sponsor, servicer, trustee, insurer, and obligor with respect to receivables contained in a trust, or an underwriter of certificates representing an interest in a trust may be a fiduciary with respect to an investing plan. NISI represents that the exercise of fiduciary authority by any of these parties to cause the plan to invest in certificates representing an interest in the trust would violate section 406(b)(1), and in some cases section 406(b)(2), of the Act. Moreover, NISI represents that to the extent there is a plan asset ``look through'' to the underlying assets of a trust, the investment in certificates by a plan covering employees of an obligor under receivables contained in a trust may be prohibited by sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act. After consideration of the issues involved, the Department has determined to provide the limited sections 406(b) and 407(a) relief as specified in the proposed exemption. Notice to Interested Persons The applicant represents that because those potentially interested participants and beneficiaries cannot all be identified, the only practical means of notifying such participants and beneficiaries of this proposed exemption is by the publication of this notice in the Federal Register . Comments and requests for a hearing18817 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices must be received by the Department not later than 30 days from the date of publication of this notice of proposed exemption in the Federal Register . For Further Information Contact: Gary Lefkowitz of the Department, telephone (202) 219\u00b18881. (This is not a toll-free number.) General Information The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: (1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; (2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; (3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and (4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a newexemption may be made to the Department. Signed at Washington, DC, this 14th day of April, 1997.

ACTION: Notice of Technical Correction. On March 5, 1997, the Department of Labor (the Department) published in the Federal Register (62 FR 10080) an individual exemption which permits: (1) Effective as of May 31, 1996, the in- kind transfer to any diversified open- end investment company (the Fund or Funds) registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 to which US Trust serves as investment adviser and may provide other services (i.e. ``Secondary Services'' as defined in therein), of the assets of various employee benefit plans (the Plans) that are either held in certain collective investment funds (CIFs) maintained by US Trust or otherwise held by US Trust as trustee, investment manager, or in any other capacity as fiduciary on behalf of the Plans, in exchange for shares of such Funds; and (2) effective as of June 30, 1996, the receipt of fees by US Trust from the Funds for acting as the investment adviser for the Funds as well as for acting as the custodian, transfer agent, sub-administrator or for providing other ``Secondary Services'' to the Funds in connection with the investment in the Funds by Plans for which US Trust acts as a fiduciary, other than Plans established and maintained by US Trust for the benefit of its employees and their beneficiaries. In the March 5th Federal Register publication, there was an error in the numerical sequence of the exemptions published on that date. In this regard, the subject exemption was erroneously designated as ``* * * Prohibited Transaction Exemption 97\u00b117'', rather than Prohibited Transaction Exemption 97\u00b116 as intended by the Department. Therefore, the Department hereby corrects such error by designating theexemption as Prohibited Transaction Exemption 97\u00b116. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Mr. E. F.

Background: National Skill Standards Board The National Skill Standards Board was created by The National Skill Standards Act of 1994 (108 Stat 192,20 U.S.C. 5933), signed into law by President Clinton on March 31, 1994. The Board's purpose as stated in the Act is ``to serve as a catalyst in stimulating the development and adoption of a voluntary national system of skill standards and of assessment and certification of attainment of skill standards: (1) that will serve as a cornerstone of the national strategy to enhance workforce skills; (2) that will result in increased productivity, economic growth, and American economic competitiveness; and (3) that can be used consistent with civil rights laws'' by the stakeholders enumerated in the Act: the nation, industries, employers, labor organizations, workers, students, entry-level workers, training providers, educators and government. This hearing is one in a series of activities conducted by the NSSB to engage in extensive public consultation as it deliberates the creation of a national voluntary skill standards system. At prior public hearings held in 1996 at numerous locations throughout the country, the Board gathered input from employers, professional associations, trade associations, unions, educators, parents, community organizations, state government agencies, and others. Their views provided a framework for the Board's development of a voluntary system of skill standards. The National Skill Standards Board will continue to develop its policies and approaches by sharing its preliminary thinking with the public before the Board's final adoption of policies. The Board also published in the December 19, 1996 Federal Register its Proposal to Establish a Voluntary National Skill Standard System and requested comments from the public. The Proposal described the grouping of jobs for the purpose of creating skill standards, as required by the National Skill Standards Act, and the framework to guide the establishment of a skill standards system. Background: Voluntary Partnerships To create these skill standards, the enabling legislation charges the NSSB with the encouragement of the establishment of voluntary Partnerships within each cluster. These Voluntary Partnerships will establish the18820 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices standards, subject to NSSB approval, for basic skill certificates. They will also review and endorse the standards for specialty certificates established for more narrowly defined occupations within the occupational cluster by groups other than the voluntary Partnership. The enabling legislation requires representation of all key stakeholders groups as described herein: Excerpted from the National Skill Standards Act of 1994 Establishment of Voluntary Partnerships to Develop Standards.\u00d0 (1) In General\u00d0For each of the occupational clusters identified pursuant to subsection (a), the National Board shall encourage and facilitate the establishment of voluntary partnerships to develop a skill standards system in accordance with subsection (d). (2) Representatives\u00d0Such voluntary partnerships shall include the full and balanced participation of\u00d0 (A)(i) representatives of business (including representatives of large employers and representatives of small employers) who have expertise in the area of workforce skill requirements, and who are recommended by national business organizations or trade associations representing employers in the occupation or industry for which a standard is being developed; and (ii) representatives of trade associations that have received grants from the Department of Labor or the Department of Education to establish skill standards prior to the date of enactment of this title; (B) employee representatives who have expertise in the area of workforce skill requirements and who shall be\u00d0 (i) individuals recommended by recognized national labor organizations representing employees in the occupation or industry for which a standard is being developed; and (ii) such other individuals who are nonmanagerial employees with significant experience and tenure in such occupation or industry as are appropriate given the nature and structure of employment in the occupation or industry; (C) representatives of\u00d0 (i) educational institutions; (ii) community-based organizations; (iii) State and local agencies with administrative control or direction over education, vocational-technical education, or employment and training; (iv) other policy development organizations with expertise in the area of workforce skill requirements; and (v) non-governmental organizations with a demonstrated history ofsuccessfully protecting the rights of racial, ethnic, or religious minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, or older persons; and (D) individuals with expertise in measurement and assessment, including relevant experience in designing unbiased assessments and performance- based assessments. (3) Experts\u00d0The partnerships described in paragraph (1) may also include such other individuals who are independent, qualified experts in their fields. The NSSB Proposed Criteria in Addition to Statutory Criteria Necessary for Recognition as a Voluntary Partnership The NSSB proposes that there will be two levels of participation in the Voluntary Partnerships; (1) general membership; and (2) voting membership. General membership will be open to all individuals interested in participating in the discussion and receiving communications about the development of a voluntary skill standards system for the cluster. Representatives from the trade associations that have received grants from the Department of Labor or the Department of Education to establish skill standards prior to the date of enactment of the National Skill Standards Act of 1994 are specifically invited to participate at this level, and may participate in the voting membership as well. Voting membership will be determined by the general membership through a democratic process. The voting membership will make decisions regarding the cluster's skill standards systems. The voting leadership must reflect, to the extent possible, the criteria defined below. The NSSB mission statement indicates that ``voluntary skill standards will be developed by industry in full partnership with education, labor and community stakeholders.'' The NSSB expects that, in keeping with its mission statement, the Voluntary Partnerships will demonstrate employer leadership, but will make every effort to include equal numbers from each of the following three broadly defined groups of stakeholders in the voting leadership: (1) Employer representatives from large, medium, small companies, public and private employers, and trade associations. (2) Worker representatives from recognized national labor organizations and expert workers who are representatives of employee associations.(3) Community representatives from education and training institutions, community-based organizations, relevant state and local agencies, other policy development organizations with expertise in the area of workforce skill requirements, individuals with expertise in measurement and assessment, and non-governmental organizations with a demonstrated history of successfully protecting the rights of women, individuals with disabilities, older persons, and racial, ethnic or religious minorities. Specific representation from community members and institutions will be determined as is logical for the cluster, e.g. if training is primarily delivered in community and career colleges, then representation should include individuals from that community. The voting members of the Voluntary Partnerships shall also, to the extent feasible, be geographically representative of the United States and reflect the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of the United States. A copy of the authorizing legislation will be available at the hearing. Interested parties may access a copy on the National Skill Standards Board web site, www.nssb.org or call (202) 254\u00b1 8628 to request a copy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : I. Background II. The Commission Policy I. Background Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (Public Law 93\u00b1438, 42 U.S.C. 5848), as amended, required the Commission to submit to Congress each quarter a report listing for that period any AOs at or associated with any facility which is licensed or otherwise regulated pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or pursuant to this Act. In a letter to the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, dated October 1, 1993, the NRC recommended to Congress a change in the AO report publication frequency from quarterly to yearly. As a result, Senate 790, ``Reports Elimination Act,'' Public Law 104\u00b166, was signed by President Clinton on December 21, 1995, changing the AO report to a yearly publication. For the purposes of Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, an AO is an unscheduled incident or event which the Commission has determined to be significant from the standpoint of public health and safety. Each such report shall contain: (1) The date and place of each occurrence; (2) The nature and probable consequence of each occurrence; (3) The cause or causes of each occurrence; and (4) Any action taken to prevent recurrence. The Commission also shall provide as wide dissemination to the public of theinformation specified in clauses (1) and (2) of this section as reasonably possible within 15 days of its receiving information of each AO and shall provide as wide dissemination to the public as reasonably possible of the information specified in clauses (3) and (4) as soon as such information becomes available. In July 1975, in the exercise of the authority conferred upon the Commission by Congress to determine which unscheduled incidents or events are significant from the standpoint of public health and safety and are reportable to Congress as AOs, the Commission developed interim criteria for evaluating licensee incidents or events. On the basis of these interim criteria and as required by Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, the Commission began issuing quarterly reports to Congress on AOs. These reports,1 ``Report to Congress on Abnormal Occurrences,'' have been issued in NUREG\u00b175/090 and NUREG\u00b10090\u00b11 through 5 for the period from January 1975 through September 1976. On the basis of its experience in the preparation and issuance of AO reports, the Commission issued a general statement of policy that described the manner in which it would, as part of the routine conduct of its business, carry out its responsibilities under Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, for identifying AOs and making the requisite information concerning each occurrence available to Congress and the public in a timely manner. This general statement of policy was published in the Federal Register on February 24, 1977 (42 FR 10950) and provided criteria and examples of types of events that the Commission would use in determining whether a particular event is reportable to Congress as an AO. The Commission has since refined this statement of policy on a number of occasions to reflect changes in regulation and policy. On the basis of these criteria, and as required by Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, the Commission has issued quarterly reports to Congress on AOs since March 1977. These reports, ``Report to Congress on Abnormal Occurrences,'' have been issued inNUREG\u00b10090\u00b16 through 10 and NUREG\u00b10090, Volumes 1 through 18. The Commission published a further revision to the AO policy statement and criteria in the Federal Register on December 19, 1996 (61 FR 67072) to reflect changes in the Commission's policy and changes to the regulations. In the Staff Requirements Memorandum dated November 7, 1996, SECY\u00b196\u00b1193, approving this most recent revision to the AO criteria the Commission directed the NRC staff to determine whether modifications to criteria III., ``For Fuel Cycle Licensees,'' were necessary to explicitly include fuel cycle facilities that are not licensed but are otherwise regulated by NRC such as the gaseous diffusion plants. The NRC staff evaluated the criteria applicable to fuel cycle facilities and has revised the criteria as follows: A. AO criteria published December 19, 1996: III. For Fuel Cycle Licensees. 1. A required plant shutdown as a result of violating a license condition or other safety limit. 2. A major condition not specifically considered in the license that requires immediate remedial action. 3. An event that seriously compromises the ability of a confinement system to perform its designated function. B. Revised AO criteria to include gaseous diffusion plants: IV. For Fuel Cycle Facilities. 1. A shutdown of the plant or portion of the plant resulting from a significant event and/or violation of a law, regulation, or a license/certificate condition. 2. A major condition or significant event not considered in the license/ certificate that requires immediate remedial action. 3. A major condition or significant event that seriously compromises the ability of a safety system to perform its designated function that requires immediate remedial action to prevent a criticality, radiological or chemical process hazard. It is expected that as additional experience is gained, further changes in the criteria may be required. Abnormal Occurrence Reporting The AO statement of policy has been developed to comply with the legislative intent of Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, to keep Congress and the public informed of unscheduled incidents or events which the Commission considers significant from the standpoint of public health and safety. The policy reflects a range of18822 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 2In addition to the criteria listed in Appendix A, section III, ``For Fuel Cycle Facilities,'' which are applicable to licensees and certificate holders, such as the gaseous diffusion plants (GDPs), other criteria of the policy statement which reference ``licensees'' or ``licensed facility'' or ``licensed material'' may also be applied to events at certified facilities such as the GDPs.health and safety concerns and is applicable to incidents and events involving a single occupational worker as well as those having an overall impact on the general public. The policy statement contains criteria that include the reporting thresholds for determining those incidents and events that are reportable by NRC for the purposes of Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended. The Commission has established the reporting thresholds at a level that will ensure that all events that should be considered for reporting to Congress will be identified. At the same time, the thresholds are generally above the normal level of reporting to NRC to exclude those events that involve some variance from regulatory limits, but are not significant from the standpoint of public health and safety. Licensee Reports This general statement of policy will not change the reporting requirements imposed on NRC licensees by Commission regulations, license conditions, or technical specifications (TS). NRC licensees will continue to submit required reports on a wide spectrum of events, including events such as instrument malfunctions and deviations from normal operating procedures that are not significant from the standpoint of the public health and safety, but do provide data useful to the Commission in monitoring operating trends of licensed facilities and in comparing the actual performance of these facilities with the potential performance for which the facilities were designed and/or licensed. Information pertaining to all events reported to the NRC will continue to be made available and placed in the public document rooms for public perusal. In addition, the NRC publishes annual reports on events (NUREG\u00b11272 series). Information can also be obtained by writing to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level) Washington, DC 20555\u00b10001. In addition, the Commission will continue to issue news announcements on events that seem to be newsworthy whether or not they are reported as AOs. II. The Commission Policy\u00d0General Statement of Policy on Implementation of Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as Amended 1. Applicability. Implementation of Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, Abnormal Occurrence Reports, involves the conduct ofCommission business and does not impose requirements on licensees2or certified facilities. Reports will cover certain unscheduled incidents or events related to the manufacture, construction, or operation of a facility or conduct of an activity subject to the requirements of Parts 20, 30 through 36, 39, 40, 50, 61, 70, 71, or 72 of Chapter I, Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR). Through an exchange of information, Agreement States provide information to the NRC on incidents and events involving applicable nuclear materials that have occurred in their States. Those events reported by Agreement States that reach the threshold for reporting as an AO are also published in the ``Report to Congress on Abnormal Occurrences.'' 2. Definition of terms. As used in this policy statement: (a) An ``abnormal occurrence'' means an unscheduled incident or event at a facility or associated with an activity that is licensed or otherwise regulated, pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, that the Commission determines to be significant from the standpoint of public health and safety; and (b) An ``unintended radiation exposure'' includes any occupational exposure, exposure to the general public, or exposure as a result of a medical misadministration (as defined in \u00a735.2) involving the wrong individual that exceeds the reporting values established in the regulations. All other reported medical misadministrations will be considered for reporting as an AO under the criteria for medical licensees. In addition, unintended radiation exposures include any exposure to a nursing child, fetus, or embryo as a result of an exposure (other than an occupational exposure to an undeclared pregnant woman) to a nursing mother or pregnant woman above specified values. 3. Abnormal occurrence general statement of policy. The Commission will apply the following policy in determining whether an incident or event at a facility or involving an activity that is licensed or otherwise regulated by the Commission is an AO within the purview of Section 208 of theEnergy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended. An incident or event will be considered an AO if it involves a major reduction in the degree of protection of the public health or safety. This type of incident or event would have a moderate or more severe impact on the public health or safety and could include, but need not be limited to the following: (1) Moderate exposure to, or release of, radioactive material licensed by or otherwise regulated by the Commission; (2) Major degradation of essential safety-related equipment; or (3) Major deficiencies in design, construction, use of, or management controls for facilities or radioactive material licensed by or otherwise regulated by the Commission. Criteria by type of event used to determine which incidents or events will be considered for reporting as AOs are set out in Appendix A of this policy statement. 4. Commission dissemination of AO information. (a) The Commission will provide as wide a dissemination of information to the public as reasonably possible. Information on potential AOs (events that may meet the AO criteria) will be sent to the NRC Public Document Room and all local public document rooms as soon as possible after the staff determines that the incident is a potential AO. A Federal Register notice will be issued on each AO report with copies distributed to the NRC Public Document Room and all local public document rooms. When additional information is anticipated, the notice will state that the information can be obtained at the NRC Public Document Room and in all local public document rooms. (b) Each year, the Commission will submit a report to Congress listing for that period any AOs at or associated with any facility or activity which is licensed or otherwise regulated pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended. This report will contain the date, place, nature, and probable consequence of each AO, the cause or causes of each AO, and any action taken to prevent recurrence. Appendix A\u00d0Abnormal Occurrence Criteria Criteria by types of events used to determine which incidents or events will be considered for reporting as AOs are as follows:18823 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices 3Information pertaining to certain incidents may be either classified or under consideration for classification because of national security implications. Classified information will be withheld when formally reporting these incidents in accordance with Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended. Any classified details regarding these incidents would be available to the Congress, upon request, under appropriate security arrangements.4The wrong radiopharmaceutical as used in the AO criterion for medical misadministrations refers to any radiopharmaceutical other than the one listed in the written directive or in the clinical procedures manual.I. For All Licensees A. Human Exposure to Radiation From Licensed Material 1. Any unintended radiation exposure to an adult (any individual 18 years of age or older) resulting in an annual total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) of 250 millisievert (mSv) (25 rem) or more; or an annual sum of the deep dose equivalent (external dose) and committed dose equivalent (intake of radioactive material) to any individual organ or tissue other than the lens of the eye, bone marrow and the gonads, of 2500 mSv (250 rem) or more; or an annual dose equivalent to the lens of the eye, of 1 Sv (100 rem) or more; or an annual sum of the deep dose equivalent and committed dose equivalent to the bone marrow, and the gonads, of 1 Sv (100 rem) or more; or an annual shallow-dose equivalent to the skin or extremities of 2500 mSv (250 rem) or more. 2.

V. Guidelines for ``Other Events of Interest'' The Commission may determine that events other than AOs may be of interest to Congress and the public and be included in an Appendix to the AO report as ``Other Events of Interest.'' Guidelines for events to be included in the AO report for this purpose are items that may possibly be perceived by the public to be of health or safety significance. Such items would not involve a major reduction in the level of protection provided for public health or safety; therefore, they would not be reported as abnormal occurrences. An example is an event where upon final evaluation by an NRC Incident Investigation Team, or an Agreement State equivalent response, a determination is made that the event does18824 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices not meet the criteria for an abnormal occurrence. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 11th day of April, 1997. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Annette Vietti-Cook, Acting Secretary of the Commission. [FR Doc. 97\u00b19912 Filed 4\u00b116\u00b197; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590\u00b101\u00b1P NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket Nos. 50\u00b1387 and 50\u00b1388] Pennsylvania Power & Light Company; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating License; Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF\u00b1 14 and NPF\u00b122, issued to Pennsylvania Power & Light Company (PP&L) (the licensee) for operation of the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station Units 1 and 2, located in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The proposed amendment would clarify the scope of the surveillance requirements for response time testing of instrumentation in the reactor protection system, isolation actuation system, and emergency core cooling system in the Technical Specifications (TSs) for each unit (Sections 4.3.1.3, 4.3.2.3, and 4.3.3.3). PP&L's request for a license amendment for each unit under exigent circumstances resulted from its recent discovery that the wording of the TS surveillance was not reconciled with the initiative to eliminate selected response time testing from the TSs. Accordingly, the licensee determined that this condition was a TS noncompliance and that prompt action to correct this situation was necessary because failure to satisfy TS surveillance requirements for response time requires that the various instruments and systems be declared inoperable, resulting in the TS required entry into cold shutdown for Unit 1 (shutdown from 100% power) and the prevention of fuel movement and the imposition of additional restrictions for Unit 2 currently in a refueling outage. The staff finds that it would be more prudent to permit the licensee to rely upon the existing response time testing for Unit 1 in lieu of testing at power, and forcing an unnecessary plant challenge by shutting down this plant, and also in lieu of restricting refueling and other activitiesat Unit 2. Further the staff finds the above sufficient justification for the licensee's exigent request for the license amendments. Before issuance of the proposed license amendments, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change only reconciles the scope of response time testing described in the surveillance requirements with the elimination of selected response time testing, performed in accordance with the NRC-approved methodology delineated in the BWROG [Boiling Water Reactor Owners Group] Licensing Topical Report (LTR) NEDO\u00b132291, 'System Analyses for Elimination of Selected Response Time Testing Requirements,' dated January 1994. Implementation of the LTR (i.e., elimination of response time testing for selected instrumentation in the Reactor Protection System, Isolation Actuation System and Emergency Core Cooling System) does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety as previously evaluated in the FSAR. All SSES component model numbers were analyzed for the failure mode of a sluggish response. As documented in the LTR, each component's sluggish response can be detected by other Technical Specification required tests (functional tests, calibrations and logic system functional tests). This supports the contention that the use of such ``qualitative'' testing does not affect the capability of the associated systems to perform their intended function within their required response time. Based upon the analysis presented above, PP&L concludes that the proposed actiondoes not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. This proposal does not create the probability of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change only reconciles the scope of response time testing described in the surveillance requirements with the elimination of selected response time testing, performed in accordance with the NRC-approved methodology delineated in the LTR. Implementation of the LTR methodology for eliminating selected response time testing also does not create the probability of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. A review of the failure modes of the affected plant equipment indicates that sluggish response of the instruments and relays can be detected by other Technical Specification surveillances. A review of SSES response time testing history revealed one response time test failure. This failure would have been detectable by the logic system functional test for this channel. Redundancy and diversity of the affected channels provide additional assurance that all affected functions will operate within the acceptance limits assumed in the plant safety analyses. PP&L's adherence to the conditions listed in the NRC SER [Safety Evaluation Report] for the LTR provides additional assurance that sluggish response of instruments and relays will be detected by the other required Technical Specification tests. A review of various safety analyses performed as part of PP&L's 10 CFR 50.59 safety evaluation revealed that the five-second delay did not adversely affect the assumptions in the respective analyses. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change only reconciles the scope of response time testing described in the surveillance requirements with the elimination of selected response time testing, performed in accordance with the NRC- approved methodology delineated in the LTR. Implementation of the LTR methodology for eliminating selected response time testing also does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The current response times are based on the maximum allowable values assumed in the plant safety analyses. The analyses conservatively establish the margin of safety. As described above, the elimination of selected response time testing does not affect the capability of the associated systems to perform their intended function within the allowed response time used as the basis for the plant safety analyses. Plant and system response to an initiating18825 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices event will remain in compliance within the assumptions of the safety analyses, and therefore the margin of safety is not affected. This is based upon the sluggish response of an instrument or relay being detected by the other required Technical Specification tests, component reliability, and redundancy and diversity of the affected functions. A review of the five-second delay of each function confirms that margin exists in the design basis for the technician to detect a sluggish response within five seconds. PP&L's adherence to the conditions listed in the NRC SER for the LTR provides additional assurance that sluggish response of instruments and relays will be detected by the other required Technical Specification tests. As described above, a review of various safety analyses performed as part of PP&L's 10 CFR 50.59 safety evaluation revealed that the five-second delay did not adversely affect the assumptions in the respective analyses. Thus, PP&L concludes that the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 14 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 14-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 14-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Chief, Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555\u00b10001, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also bedelivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. By May 19, 1997, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room located at the Osterhout Free Library, Reference Department, 71 South Franklin Street, Wilkes-Barre, PA 18701. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any18826 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555\u00b10001, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1\u00b1(800) 248\u00b15100 (in Missouri 1\u00b1(800) 342\u00b16700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to John F.

ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation intends to request that the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') extend the approval for a collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act. The information collection relates to the opportunity the PBGC gives companies maintaining single-employer pension plans with significant underfunding to correct data that the PBGC has on their plans' underfunding. The effect of this notice is to solicit public comment on this collection of information prior to the PBGC's request for an extension of approval. DATES: Comments should be submitted to the PBGC by June 16, 1997. ADDRESSES : All written comments should be addressed to: The Office of the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Suite 340, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005. The comments will be available for public inspection at the PBGC Communications and Public Affairs Department, Suite 240, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Copies of the materials may be obtained free of charge by writing to the PBGC Communications and Public Affairs Department at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : James L. Beller, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Suite 340, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005, 202\u00b1326\u00b14024 (202\u00b1326\u00b14179 for TTY and TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : The PBGC administers the pension plan termination insurance programs under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. ). To address concerns about the potential vulnerability of the single-employer insurance program to large claims, the PBGC needs current information on the funded status of plans with large amounts of underfunding. Information otherwise available to the PBGC is either not current enough (Form 5500 filings), not complete enough (PBGC Form 1 filings), or not public (filings under ERISA section 4010).Since 1990, the PBGC has collected information on the companies whose underfunded plans present the largest potential claims against the PBGC by taking data from public corporate annual reports and the PBGC premium filings and adjusting that information to a standard interest rate and mortality table. Because the annual report data often includes foreign and other non- PBGC covered plans and the premium filings are not complete enough for this purpose, companies (and the PBGC) were concerned about the accuracy and completeness of the data. After the first public use of this data, companies suggested that the PBGC give them a chance to review the data. As a result, the PBGC now annually contacts companies with the largest underfunding and requests that they verify (or correct) and, if they wish, supplement PBGC information on the amount of accumulated and vested benefits, the amount of plan assets, and the interest and mortality assumptions they used to value benefits in their covered plans. Respondents also may choose to recalculate accumulated, vested, and guaranteed benefits, and administrative expense loading charges, as well as to provide information on additional contributions made to the plans. The PBGC provides two simple response forms (which are not required to be used). In response to requests from companies, the PBGC also provides sample enrolled actuary certifications. These certifications are required for companies that elect to recalculate benefits or administrative expenses. The PBGC uses the responses to improve the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of information obtained from other sources. The data is used in various agency efforts, including estimating the potential exposure of the single-employer termination insurance program, legislative and other policy analyses, selecting plans for monitoring, responding to congressional requests for information on companies whose plans are significantly underfunded, and identifying for the public those companies with large levels of underfunding (including the amount of underfunding by company) or poor funding ratios. The PBGC expects to contact about 400 companies annually (more if the interest rate is low; fewer if the interest rate is high) whose underfunding for vested benefits is greater than $25 million. Based on prior experience, the PBGC assumes that 90% of those contacted (360 responses) will choose to respond (even though this collection of information is voluntary). The PBGC estimates that the total annual hour18827 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices burden that will result from this collection is 1,440 hours and that the total annual cost burden is $216,000. The PBGC is soliciting public comments to: (i) Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility; (ii) Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (iii) Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (iv) Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses.

SUMMARY: The Commission has adopted a Second Report and Order (Second R&O) in PR Docket No. 92\u00b1235 which continues its efforts to develop a strategy for encouraging more efficient use of private land mobile radio (PLMR) spectrum below 800 MHz. In the Report and Order (R&O ) in this docket, the Commission concluded that the PLMR bands below 800 MHz should be consolidated and competition should be introduced into the frequency coordination process. This Second R&O consolidates the twenty existing PLMR services into two broad service pools\u00d0 Public Safety and Industrial/Business\u00d0 with appropriate provisions for ensuring that the safety of the public will not be compromised. Additionally, the Commission adopts rules to allow centralized trunking, under certain conditions, in the shared bands below 800 MHz and implements a plan for protecting current low power operations in the 450\u00b1470 MHz band. Finally, the Commission addresses a Request for Temporary Relief filed by several public safety frequency coordinators.

Summary of Second Report and Order 1. Our primary goal in this proceeding has been to address the increasing communications requirements of the private land mobile radio (PLMR)community by developing a strategy for encouraging more efficient use of PLMR spectrum below 800 MHz\u00d0 i.e., those and Order (60 FR 37152, July 19, 1995) in this docket served as a critical first step toward achieving this goal. In that decision, we adopted extensive rule changes to promote highly effective and efficient use of the PLMR spectrum and to facilitate the introduction of advanced technologies into the private mobile services. We also concluded that the PLMR Services must be consolidated and that competition should be introduced into the coordinator services for each service group. We stated that consolidation of the twenty PLMR service groups below 800 MHz would ``provide for more efficient allocation of the increased capacity created by the introduction of more efficient technology.'' 2. By this Second Report and Order, we consolidate the twenty PLMR Services into two broad service pools, with appropriate provision for ensuring that the safety of the public will not be compromised. In addition, we resolve two other issues raised in conjunction with consolidation: (a) Whether to permit centralized trunking, and (b) how to implement the decision in the R&O to provide protection for current low power operations in the 450\u00b1470 MHz band. Additionally, we address a Request for Temporary Relief filed by several public safety coordinators. We have, generally, delayed the effective date of these rules until six months after publication in the Federal Register in order to provide coordinators sufficient time to implement consolidation. Today's action is the next critical step toward providing a regulatory framework which promotes efficient use of PLMR spectrum below 800 MHz. 3. This proceeding concerns PLMR frequencies in the bands below 800 MHz administered under part 90 of the Commission's rules (47 CFR part 90). The our current rules, these frequencies are divided into twenty separate radio services, grouped in four general categories: (1) Public Safety Radio Services (Local Government, Police, Fire, Highway Maintenance, Forestry-Conservation, and Emergency Medical Radio Services); (2) Special Emergency Radio Service; (3) Industrial Radio Services (Power, Petroleum, Forest Products, Film & Video Production, Relay Press, Special Industrial, Business, Manufacturers, and TelephoneMaintenance Radio Services); and (4) Land Transportation Radio Services (Motor Carrier, Railroad, Taxicab, and Automobile Emergency Radio Services). The Radiolocation Service (47 CFR part 90, subpart F) is not listed, even though it has frequencies below 800 MHz, because it is not considered a PLMR Service. 4. In determining that consolidation of the twenty PLMR Services would best serve the public interest, we stressed that the intended purpose of consolidating radio services ``is to distribute assignments between low-use and high-use groups more evenly, to simplify interservice sharing procedures, to organize channel allocations that will enable licensees to more easily utilize advanced technologies, and to organize the services in such manner to achieve more efficient and flexible spectrum use.'' We also recognized the importance of different services, particularly Public Safety, and encouraged commenters to develop a plan that included a Public Safety pool. We further recommended that such a plan contain clear guidelines regarding the requirements for inclusion in such a Public Safety pool. We considered these guidelines necessary to prevent overcrowding and to maintain the integrity of critical functions of the users included within this pool. While we indicated that two to four broad categories, including one for Public Safety licensees, appeared reasonable, we deferred a final decision on the precise contours of consolidation to provide members of the PLMR community, including users, manufacturers, and frequency coordinators, with an opportunity to negotiate and submit a consensus consolidation proposal to the Commission. In providing this opportunity, we stated that if a consensus could not be reached, we would adopt a plan based on the record. That contingency has come to pass; no consensus was reached. 5. We also recommended that the PLMR community address other related issues, such as how to effectively introduce competition among frequency coordinators, whether a single coordinator or multiple coordinators should be authorized for public safety users, how the existing databases can be shared to ensure fair competition among all of the frequency coordinators, whether a national real-time data base to reflect frequency assignments can be created and used, and what approach should be taken to designate frequencies for low power use on a primary basis. We received twenty-eight comments, fourteen reply comments, and two18835 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday /April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations 1See Final Report of the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee, September 1996, Volume 1, Section 1.18.supplemental comments recommending or supporting a variety of consolidation plans and a number of ex parte submissions. In addition, the Industrial Telecommunications Association (ITA) submitted a proposed technical blueprint for consolidation (Blueprint). We placed this on Public Notice and received forty comments and nine reply comments in response. 6. The Commission also received a number of petitions for reconsideration requesting that we reconsider or clarify various rule changes adopted in the R&O. Several of the petitions raised issues related to consolidation. In our recent Memorandum Opinion and Order (MO&O ) (62 FR 2027, January 15, 1997) addressing these petitions, we stated that we would address the issues related to consolidation when we adopted a specific consolidation plan. Finally, the Commission received a Request for Temporary Relief to permit the frequency coordinators for the Fire, Highway Maintenance, and Forestry- Conservation Radio Services to continue to coordinate frequencies that were formerly assigned to their respective pools as low power offset channels. 7. Number of pools. We received a wide range of recommendations in response to our call for a consensus plan on consolidation. The comments contain a range of choices, proposing consolidation of the PLMR Services into two to five pools. Those who propose specific plans all agree that there should be a separate pool for public safety services. Additionally, a number of commenters oppose consolidation in general, arguing that the current system should be retained. 8. After careful analysis, we have determined that a modified two-pool approach will best achieve the benefits of consolidation without compromising safety of the general public. A consolidation of all twenty PLMR services will significantly increase licensee flexibility to manage the spectrum more efficiently through access to additional spectrum and accommodation of advanced technologies. An additional benefit of PLMR service consolidation is that it should reduce administrative burdens on users as well as the Commission. We believe that the safeguards we are adopting for safety-related communications combined with the modifications to the frequency coordination process will adequately address the concerns raised by the proponents of three or more service pools. 9. This two-pool structure is also best in terms of increasing flexibility and spectrum efficiency by giving usersaccess to a larger pool of frequencies. Further, the increased flexibility provided by a two-pool structure enhances the use of advanced technologies, such as trunking. For example, making additional spectrum available to licensees will allow public safety entities to more easily implement and use trunked systems to perform a number of their public safety functions. We believe that such a result is in the public interest because it will help improve public safety communication capabilities and reduce the costs of building and operating public safety communication systems. 10. A two-pool structure also reduces administrative and financial burdens on applicants. For example, this consolidation approach will eliminate the need to go through interservice sharing procedures in order to obtain authorization to operate on frequencies available in other radio services. This in turn allows users to get on the air sooner as well as saves them from having to pay more than one coordination fee. 11. Accordingly, we are adopting two pools\u00d0Public Safety and Industrial/ Business\u00d0as the basic framework for the PLMR bands below 800 MHz. Frequencies that were in any of the Public Safety Radio Services will be combined in the new Public Safety Pool. Similarly, frequencies that were in any of the Industrial or Land Transportation Radio Services will be combined in the new Industrial/Business Pool. Further, we put frequencies in the 421\u00b1430 MHz band allocated for public safety use in three cities in the Public Safety Pool and those frequencies allocated for business and industrial/land transportation use in three cities in the Industrial/Business Pool. Frequencies in each of the two pools will be available to all eligibles in that pool, unless reserved for a specific function. We have listed the 470\u00b1512 MHz band in each pool rather than divide up the frequencies between the two pools. The Commission already consolidated the various pools in this band into one pool\u00d0the General Access Pool. Further, unlike our current approach to the other bands, where frequencies are allocated to a specific service or group of services, frequencies in the 470\u00b1512 MHz band are available to all eligibles on a first come, first served basis. Thus, it would be impossible to divide these frequencies into different pools. 12. Finally, we recognize that the fundamental changes to the PLMR Services below 800 MHz adopted herein cannot be implemented without a reasonable transition time. Accordingly, we will delay the effective date of the new pools and associated rules adoptedin this proceeding until October 17, 1997. 13. Eligibility\u00d0Public Safety Pool. We believe that all of the six current Public Safety Radio Services, as well as the Special Emergency Radio Service, should be included in the Public Safety Pool. Any governmental entity will be eligible to use any Public Safety Pool frequency. Additionally, non- governmental entities that apply for frequencies that were previously available solely for public safety services shall obtain a statement of support from the governmental entity having legal jurisdiction over the area to be served. Including all the Public Safety Radio Services and the Special Emergency Radio Service in one pool will promote the development of wide- area (state and regional) trunked systems that, in turn, will save scarce resources. Further, it will promote interoperability by allowing all governmental entities as well as non- governmental entities involved in ensuring the safety of life ( e.g., hospitals, ambulance companies) to communicate with one another. To further promote interoperability, we suggest coordinators in this pool examine the benefits of using the consensus plan approach discussed herein for low power operations as a way to reserve channels for universal mutual aid. Finally, defining eligibility in this way is consistent with (1) the Commission's definition of public safety services in GEN Docket No. 87\u00b1112 (53 FR 1022, January 15, 1988), which established the Public Safety National Plan in the 821\u00b1824/866\u00b1869 MHz bands, and (2) the PSWAC's definition of public safety as specified in its Final Report1as well as the Commission's proposals in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making in WT Docket No. 96\u00b186 (61 FR 25185, May 20, 1996). 14. An additional issue was raised by several public safety frequency coordinators with respect to entities in the Public Safety Pool. These coordinators are concerned that the reallocation of former low power offset channels in the R&O from the Fire, Forestry-Conservation, and Highway Maintenance Radio services to the Local Government Radio Service adversely affects the ability of users to access these channels and restricts the coordinators' abilities to recommend suitable channels. Specifically, non- governmental entities, such as volunteer fire departments and nature conservatories, who are currently18836 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday /April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations 2See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103\u00b166, Title VI, section 6002(b)(2)(A), 6002(b)(2)(B), 107 Stat. 312, 392 (1993).eligible in the Fire and Forestry- Conservation Radio Services respectively, are not eligible in the Local Government Radio Service and may suffer harm due to this reduction in available channels. 15. Pursuant to the rules adopted herein concerning consolidation, these non-governmental entities will be eligible for all frequencies in the public safety pool, including the low power offsets transferred from the Fire and Forestry-Conservation Radio Services to the Local Government Radio Service. However, since the rule amendments being adopted in this Second R&O will not take effect for six months, we are concerned that the identified entities could suffer harm if the Commission does not take more immediate action. Therefore, effective immediately, we are amending the eligibility requirements of the Local Government Radio Service to include non-governmental entities who are currently eligible in the Fire and Forestry-Conservation Radio Services. As under the previous rules, these non- government entities must obtain a statement of support from the governmental entity having legal jurisdiction over the area to be served. Such action will provide these non- governmental entities access to the spectrum they need to ensure the integrity of their communications systems. 16. This action is taken pursuant to section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(d)) which permits an agency to implement a rule prior to thirty days after publication when the rule ``* * * relieves a restriction.'' Here, we find that this rule amendment will provide certain non- governmental entities the ability to access spectrum that they were able to prior to the effectiveness of the rules adopted in the Refarming R&O. Additionally, we note that pursuant to the consolidation rules being adopted herein, these non-governmental entities will be eligible for licensing on any frequency in the Public Safety Pool, upon the effective date of the consolidation rules, subject to a statement of support from the governmental entity having legal jurisdiction over the area to be served. 17. Eligibility\u00d0Industrial/Business Pool. The Industrial/Business Pool will be comprised of frequencies that were previously allotted to any of the Industrial or Land Transportation Radio Services, including the Business Radio Service. Anyone eligible in one of these radio services will be eligible in the new Industrial/Business Pool for any frequency in that pool unless specifically precluded. In this regard,we have adopted the eligibility criteria from the old Business Radio Service. Accordingly, anyone engaged in a commercial activity is eligible. Also, educational, philanthropic and ecclesiastical institutions are eligible. 18. We note that our consolidation of the Industrial and Land Transportation Services, including the Business Radio Service, into one pool\u00d0the Industrial/ Business Pool, potentially may affect the current regulatory classification of the licensees in this pool. In the Second Report and Order in GN Docket No. 93\u00b1 252 (59 FR 18493, April 19, 1994) (CMRS Second Report and Order ), we examined the regulatory status of all existing mobile services to determine whether they were commercial mobile radio services (CMRS) or private mobile radio services (PMRS) under section 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act).2In the CMRS Second Report and Order , we concluded that with the exception of the Business Radio Service, all Industrial and Land Transportation Services would be classified as PMRS under section 332(d)(3) of the Act. In the case of the Business Radio Service, however, we determined that the eligibility rules are sufficiently broad to render this service effectively available to a substantial portion of the public. Consequently, classification of Business Radio Service licensees depends on whether they meet the other two elements of the CMRS definition\u00d0 operating a for-profit service and interconnected with the public switched network. As a result, we are concerned that by defining the eligibility for this consolidated pool in the same fashion as we did for the Business Radio Service, licensees (both current and future) on the old Industrial and Land Transportation frequencies (Industrial/ Business Pool frequencies under consolidation) may now be deemed to offer service to a substantial portion of the public. Consequently, such licensees offering for-profit, interconnected service arguably could be classified as CMRS. Given that the rules we adopt today will not be effective for six months, we believe that the most prudent course of action is to defer resolution of this issue and fully address it in a future proceeding. In the context of this future proceeding, we will also examine the negative impact, if any, of such regulatory classification on the availability of frequencies to satisfy the communications needs of PLMR users.19. Interservice sharing. Under the existing rules, there are provisions that allow entities establishing eligibility under one radio service to obtain a license for a frequency in another radio service under certain conditions (interservice sharing). Because we are eliminating the individual radio service categories and consolidating the PLMR Services into two pools, interservice sharing rules will no longer be necessary. Under consolidation, applicants will have the opportunity to apply directly for in-pool frequencies that were previously allocated to radio services other than their own. Accordingly, we will delete \u00a7 90.176. 20. The existing interservice sharing rules allow for sharing between radio services in the Public Safety Radio Services (group 1). The rules also permit sharing between the Special Emergency Radio Service and radio services in the Industrial and Land Transportation Radio Services (group 2). Sharing has not been permitted, however, between radio services in group 1 and group 2. While we believe that such sharing could increase flexibility, we do not think that it is appropriate to introduce interpool sharing at this time. Given the difficult logistics of consolidating twenty radio services into two pools, introducing additional requirements on the frequency coordinators could put undue pressures on the new two-pool system. Therefore, we will prohibit sharing between the Public Safety Pool and the Industrial/Business Pool, at least for the present time. We may revisit this issue once the consolidated system is running smoothly. 21. Frequency Coordination. In stating our intention to consolidate the PLMR Services, the Commission recognized that changes may have to be made in the current frequency coordination process. In the paragraphs below, we discuss changes in the coordination process in light of our decision to consolidate the PLMR Services into two pools. We recognize that additional changes may be necessary as we gain more experience with consolidation or if additional responsibilities are given to coordinators. 22. Coordinators. Allowing existing certified coordinators to continue their coordination functions will reduce confusion and help ensure that the public continues to receive access to vital services. Therefore, we certify current coordinators for the Public Safety Radio Services and the Special Emergency Radio Service as coordinators in the new Public Safety Pool. Similarly, we certify current coordinators in the Industrial and Land Transportation Radio Services as18837 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday /April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations coordinators in the new Industrial/ Business Pool. 23. With respect to the Public Safety Pool, we generally agree with the commenters that at the present time, except as indicated below, applicants for a frequency in the new Public Safety Pool should be required to obtain coordination from the current recognized frequency coordinator for the specified frequencies. 24. We are taking a slightly different approach regarding frequencies that are currently assigned to the Local Government Radio Service. We will allow any coordinator currently certified in the Public Safety Radio Services to coordinate frequencies in the Local Government Radio Service. This action is taken for several reasons. Frequencies in the Local Government Radio service are used routinely by Police, Fire, Highway Maintenance, Forestry Conservation and Emergency Medical (governmental entities) eligibles for both non-emergency and emergency communications. For example, in many communities Local Government frequencies may be the principal fire or highway maintenance frequencies and part of a public safety communications plan for these services. Therefore, it would seem appropriate for the fire or highway maintenance coordinator (or other public safety coordinator if those frequencies are being used in another context) to be able to provide coordination for these frequencies if they are being used in a fire or highway maintenance communications system. Further, there are a large number of 450\u00b1470 MHz frequencies allocated to all the Public Safety Radio Services. Since these frequencies are available to all public safety entities (just like Local Government frequencies) any of the certified public safety coordinators may provide coordination. Thus, there is a coordination mechanism already in place to accommodate multiple coordinators where public safety frequencies are shared between public safety eligibles. Finally, this will introduce competition, to the extent possible, into this pool which, in turn, should result in lower coordination costs and better service to the public. 25. The integrity of the public safety services must be maintained without fail. Having each public safety coordinator continue to manage the same frequencies and have access to all of the current Local Government frequencies, will preserve much of the status quo, provide coordinators access to a greater number of frequencies with which to accommodate applicants, and permit applicants to apply directly forfrequencies that were previously available only through interservice sharing procedures. Also, preserving the jurisdiction of the individual coordinators over their current spectrum, while expanding access to Local Government frequencies, will help ensure consistency with local, regional, and state public safety communications plans. This issue could be revisited in the future if a more integrated coordination system could be designed that would not impair public safety interests. 26. The Industrial/Business Pool does not present the same concerns as the Public Safety Pool. Therefore, except as discussed below, we will allow any in- pool coordinator to coordinate any frequency in the pool. As a direct result of this action, we believe that further competition will be introduced into the frequency coordination process. This, in turn, should result in lower coordination costs and better service to the public. For example, we believe market forces will reduce the time it takes to obtain a coordination thereby allowing users to get on-the-air quicker. Further, the concept of allowing applicants the opportunity to select among multiple coordinators is not unique among Part 90 users. Before the band was reallocated, applicants for conventional and trunked systems on General Category frequencies had the option of seeking frequency coordination from any of three frequency coordinators certified to recommend 800 MHz frequencies. 27.We recognize that within the Industrial/Business Pool, some types of radio users employ radio not just for day-to-day business needs but also to respond to emergencies that could be extremely dangerous to the general public. We believe maintaining the integrity of spectrum used for such public safety purposes is extremely important and using coordinators who are knowledgeable with such special communication needs is the best way to protect these systems. 28. Therefore, for the time being, entities who apply for frequencies which are currently allocated solely to the Railroad, Power, or Petroleum Radio Services must obtain coordination from the current certified frequency coordinator for the respective service. We expect, however, that these coordinators will make every effort to accommodate all applicants on these frequencies, regardless of the type of business they conduct. We believe that using coordinators who are knowledgeable with such special communication needs is the best way to protect these operations, which involvesafety-related communications, and outweighs any potential benefits that may be gained through a competitive frequency coordination process. For frequencies in the Railroad, Power, or Petroleum Radio Services that are also allocated to another radio service, however, entities may utilize the services of any certified frequency coordinator in the Industrial/Business Pool. The alternative would be to require entities in the radio services where the frequencies are shared to go through a different coordinator than they do now. We may revisit this issue once we obtain more experience with the new coordination system or when we address the issue of exclusivity raised in the Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (60 FR 37148, July 19, 1995) in this docket. 29. Technical Coordination Procedures. The consolidation of the PLMR services and the introduction of multiple coordinators raise concerns of unfair coordinations and coordinator shopping. We believe that a minimum set of technical coordination procedures to which all frequency coordinators must adhere is the least burdensome method of providing all members of the PLMR community with confidence that all new and existing radio systems will be adequately protected from interference. A minimum set of coordination procedures will also alleviate concerns of coordinator shopping. Rather than establish specific procedures at this time, however, we believe that the coordinators should attempt to reach consensus themselves on the applicable coordination procedures. We understand that this process takes time. In this regard, we note the efforts of Telecommunications Industry Associations (TIA) Working Group 8.8 (WG 8.8), which has been developing technical procedures for the frequency coordination process. Given the progress of the TIA WG 8.8 and the potential harm that could befall clients' systems from a lack of technical coordination procedures we are confident that the frequency coordinators will reach an agreement on such procedures quickly. 30. Data exchange. Under the current PLMR Service structure, there has been little need for frequency coordinators to share detailed information about applicants' systems with other coordinators. Under the consolidated pool approach, however, commenters have indicated a need to establish a system for information exchange, but disagree on how this should best be achieved. For example, UTC recommends that coordinators in each pool devise a means of exchanging data18838 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday /April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations either through a real-time method, using a shared database, or by providing notice, by facsimile or E-Mail, with a limited opportunity for response provided. Other coordinators state that a common database has to be established and maintained to ensure that applications, once submitted, are not in conflict with other applications being submitted at the same time. The Joint Pool, however, also expresses opposition to developing a national database noting that the complexity of such an undertaking would involve coordinating a substantial number of parties in order to include information that is necessary and relevant to the coordination process. It contends that electronic transmitting and receiving of frequency notifications is preferable to establishing a national coordinators' database. 31. We agree with the commenters that a real-time common coordinator database may be desirable. Such a resource could be an ideal method for coordinators to share data and maintain up-to-date records of all frequency recommendations so that they can avoid coordinating multiple applications for the same channel, in the same area, at approximately the same time. We also recognize, however, that implementing a real-time common database would require extensive time, expense, and testing to perfect and that there may be other less costly and less complex methods to ensure that all necessary data is exchanged in a timely manner. Therefore, at this time, we will leave the issue of whether to use a real-time common database to perform their coordination duties to the coordinators' discretion. We believe that they are in the better position of determining what will allow them to perform such duties in an efficient effective, and expeditious manner. Coordinators may select to develop their own common database to make frequency recommendations, use the Commission's data base, or use the services of a third party. We note that copies of the Commission's database are available through the National Technical Information Service. Further, the Commission provides on-line access to its PLMR Service database through a third party contractor and puts license grant information on the Internet. Any disputes that arise due to inconsistencies or discrepancies in the records of different coordinators, however, will be resolved using the Commission's database. 32. Although we are not requiring that a common database be implemented at this time, the need to share accurate and timely coordination information with all in-pool coordinators still exists. Withoutsuch information, frequency coordinators would not know what other in-pool coordinators are doing and could make conflicting coordinations. Therefore, coordinators must provide notification of all frequency recommendations within one business day of making such recommendations to every certified in-pool coordinator that is also certified to coordinate that frequency. Additionally, on frequencies that are shared between both the Public Safety and Industrial/Business Pools, coordinators must notify all coordinators of frequency recommendations. We believe this notification requirement is extremely important to the consolidation process. Notification will not only improve the speed and quality of recommendations, but it will also encourage and facilitate the cooperation between in-pool coordinators that is so important to the success of the overall coordination process. We believe a one-day notification period is a good compromise between the need to provide information to coordinators quickly to minimize the chance of conflicting coordinations and the need to minimize burdens on the coordinators. Additionally, notification must be made to all in-pool coordinators at approximately the same time. At a minimum, each notification must include: name of applicant, frequency or frequencies recommended, antenna height, antenna locations, type of emissions, effective radiated power, a description of the service area, and the time the recommendation was made. To safeguard this system, we will require that each coordinator communicate at least once each business day with each other in-pool coordinator. Therefore, on days in which no coordinations are made, notification is still required. Coordinators, if they desire, are free to include additional information such as more data or a list of rejected coordination requests with their notifications. 33. In addition to notification of basic information on frequency recommendations, coordinators, in certain cases, may need more detailed information in order to perform engineering analyses. Therefore, each coordinator must supply, upon request, within one business day, any additional information requested regarding a pending coordination that it processed. Of course, coordinators are free to provide this information in their routine notifications if they so desire. 34. Another issue raised in the comments was the question of concurrence. Given the requirement to establish standard coordinationprocedures, we believe requiring concurrence would be redundant. Further, it could have a negative impact on our efforts to increase the quality of customer service through competition. Nevertheless, we are concerned that under the approach described herein applicants could start transmitting prior to other in-pool coordinators being notified. While we want the licensing process to be as quick as possible and believe that such situations will rarely occur, we believe all affected coordinators should be aware of a proposed operation before the entity can start transmitting. Therefore, we will amend \u00a7 90.159 to institute a mandatory waiting period of ten business days before applicants can begin transmitting pursuant to temporary and conditional authorization. 35. We believe that the procedures outlined above will prevent the filing of conflicting applications. However, we realize that the one-day period between when a frequency recommendation is made and other coordinators are notified could still result in a small number of conflicting applications. In these instances, it is the joint responsibility of the applicable coordinators to take action necessary to resolve the conflict, up to and including notifying the Commission that an application may need to be returned. The coordinators are in the best position to recognize and expediently resolve such conflicts. Additionally, we believe that each coordinator should have some responsibility to help resolve problems related to their recommendations. The Commission will become involved only if the coordinators cannot agree to a solution. 36. As discussed above, coordinators will be responsible for providing other coordinators certain information within a specified time frame. We are confident, based on past experience, that coordinators will meet these requirements. However, as we have noted in the past when giving responsibility to coordinators, the Commission may, on its own motion, or at the public's request conduct an inquiry into a particular coordinator's performance. After any such investigation we will determine whether decertification or other action is warranted. 37. Coordinator authority. Currently, frequency coordinators have the authority to request additional information from applicants requesting coordination if they believe that such information is needed to make proper frequency recommendations. The Land Mobile Communications Council (LMCC) in its petition for18839 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday /April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations reconsideration requests that we (1) amend \u00a7 90.175 to provide specific authority for coordinators to request all appropriate technical information, system requirements, and justification for requested station parameters from applicants; (2) indicate that applicants bear the burden of proof in overturning the recommendations of a certified frequency coordinator; and (3) state that frequency coordinators may recommend appropriate changes to the parameters of previously licensed stations, or take other appropriate measures that will help to minimize harmful interference or remedy incompatible adjacent channel or co-channel operations. 38. In the R&O, the Commission stated that coordinators may request additional information from the applicant when such information is needed for the coordinator to make a proper frequency recommendation. The Commission also noted in that same proceeding that, in the event of a dispute between the coordinator and an applicant, the applicant will have the burden of proof and persuasion in overturning the coordinator's recommendation. While we consider this to be our present policy, in order to eliminate any confusion we will amend \u00a790.175 to specify this authority. With respect to LMCC's other suggestion, coordinators, as well as anyone else for that matter, can always make recommendations concerning minimizing interference. We see no reason to state this explicitly in our rules. 39. Trunking in the PLMR Bands Below 800 MHz. In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (56 FR 31097, July 9, 1991) in this proceeding we proposed to allow centralized trunking (``trunking'') in the 150\u00b1174 MHz and 421\u00b1512 MHz bands in those areas where exclusivity is recognized by the Commission, or where all co-channel licensees concur. Although the comments on this issue supported allowing centralized trunking, we did not adopt rules since the Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Further NPRM) (60 FR 37148, July 18, 1995) in this docket addressed the issue of exclusivity. 40. Trunked systems will allow PLMR licensees to construct systems which are more efficient than conventional systems, thereby allowing licensees to use fewer channels to provide the same communications capability. Therefore, rather than defer the issue until we reach a decision on exclusivity, we believe the public will benefit by allowing trunking on frequencies below 800 MHz now, provided certain conditions are met.41. To allow trunking to work effectively and efficiently in the PLMR shared bands, we are adopting rules similar to those adopted for interconnection of PLMR stations with the Public Switched Network. We will permit licensees to implement centralized trunked systems in and 470\u00b1512 MHz bands, provided that they (1) obtain the consent of all licensees whose service areas overlap a circle with a radius of 113 km (70 mi) from the trunked system's base station and whose operating frequency is 15 kHz or less removed from the operating frequency of a trunked system designed to operate on 25 kHz channels or 7.5 kHz or less removed from a 12.5 kHz trunked system or 3.75 kHz or less removed from a 6.25 kHz trunked system; and (2) comply with all frequency coordination requirements. Statements stipulating the terms of such agreements must be forwarded to the applicable frequency coordinator and the Commission as an attachment to the license application or modification. In the Further NPRM, we proposed that PLMR licensees be able to obtain some form of exclusivity in their respective service areas. If such rules are adopted, licensees would be able to implement trunked systems in these exclusive areas, provided that they modify their license to show such operation. 42. In areas where licensees implement trunking, new licensees can be assigned the same channel(s) as the trunked system if the new licensee reaches a mutual agreement with the licensee(s) operating the trunked system. If a licensee who previously consented or agreed to participate in a trunked system later decides against this use, and that licensee is unable to negotiate a mutual agreement with the operator(s) of the trunked system, that licensee may request that the Commission reassign it to another channel. This approach provides licensees with maximum flexibility in the operation of their systems while assuring that the use of centralized trunking will not detrimentally impact the operation of another licensee's system. 43. Low Power Frequencies. To encourage more efficient use of the available spectrum, the Commission permitted all eligible users in the 450\u00b1 470 MHz band to be licensed for low power operations ( i.e., not to exceed 2 watts) on a secondary non-interference basis on frequencies offset 12.5 kHz from regularly assignable frequencies (``offset channels''). Since that time, these channels have been heavily used for certain low power operations such asmedical telemetry and remote operation of heavy machinery. Under the new channel plan adopted in the R&O, these channels are no longer considered offset channels. Rather, they are regularly assignable channels available for high power operations on a primary basis. We have previously recognized, however, that there is a continuing need for low power operation and provided frequency coordinators with the authority to designate specific channels for low power use. Additionally, we suggested that frequency coordinators exercise this authority in conjunction with the formulation of a consolidation plan. Finally, the Commission provided low power licensees with the option of staying on their currently licensed channel or moving to a coordinator- designated low power frequency and obtaining primary status. Due to the uncertainty surrounding consolidation of the PLMR Services, coordinators have been reluctant to designate any channels specifically for low power use before a Commission decision on consolidation. On August 11, 1995, at the request of HP, the Commission froze applications requesting power in excess of that previously permitted on the offsets until such time as the issues relative to consolidation and/or the designation of low power frequencies are resolved. 44. Designated Channels. We understand the reluctance, to date, of coordinators to designate specific channels for low power use. At the same time, however, we believe it is vitally important for the PLMR community to address the issue of low power channels as soon as possible. Would-be licensees of offset channels cannot apply to use these channels for high power operations because of the current licensing freeze, and low power users want assurance that they will be protected from interference by high powered operations before switching channels. Accommodating these competing interests while establishing a workable low power frequency plan is not a trivial matter. In major metropolitan areas, the demand for both high power and low power operations exceeds the number of frequencies available. Moreover, it is highly likely that such high power and low power needs will vary based on geographic location. In this connection, we believe that the coordinators will need some time to analyze the current use patterns of these offset channels and determine a compromise solution between the two types of operations. Therefore, in accordance with the recommendation of LMCC, we will give the coordinators in each of the two pools six months from18840 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday /April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations publication of this Second Report and Order in the Federal Register to develop a consensus plan for low power operations in their respective pools. 45. HP recommended that we codify the basic aspects of the plan fashioned by the coordinators. In the R&O, we delegated to the frequency coordinators the authority to designate low power frequencies; our decision was not to specify such frequencies in the rules. We continue to believe that this approach provides the frequency coordinators, who have knowledge of user requirements and local conditions, with maximum flexibility in the management of the PLMR spectrum. Further, this allows frequencies to be easily added or subtracted from the designated list as may be warranted. We find nothing in the record at this time that persuades us to change this approach. Further, consistent with this approach, we will leave it up to the coordinators whether to designate contiguous spectrum or to specify individual channels (non-contiguous spectrum) for low power operations. Low power operation on the designated channels will be protected through coordination and the Commission's licensing process. As specified in the R&O, frequency coordinators will be required to maintain a list of low power channels and make it available to the public upon request. We encourage the frequency coordinators to periodically review the low power channel plan and modify it when appropriate. If a consensus regarding the establishment of a low power channel plan cannot be reached, we will revisit this issue. 46. Time Frame for Migration. In addition to its recommendation that the frequency coordinators be given six months to determine which channels should be designated for low power use, LMCC recommends several steps to ensure that the migration of low power users from their current channels to these new designated channels occurs smoothly. These suggested measures include (1) low power offset licensees being given six months to declare their intent to convert to primary status by either registering their coordinates or by modifying their license to operate on the designated low power channels; and (2) providing seven months for offset licensees to migrate to the designated channels. We agree with LMCC that low power users should be able to attain primary status on these offset channels if they so desire by modifying their licenses to specify transmitter coordinates so that frequency coordinators know the location of such systems and can take them into account when making frequencyrecommendations. In this connection, we will confer primary status on licensees operating on the former low power offset channels that already have provided their coordinates to the Commission. These licensees should notify the Commission at the time of their license renewal that they are operating in this manner. This will give offset licensees the flexibility to remain on their current licensed frequency or change to a new low power frequency. Because these channels are available for high power operation, however, licensees that remain on their current licensed frequency may have to share it with a new high power user. Therefore, we expect that the majority of low power users will be inclined to migrate to the new low power channels once they are identified in order to reduce the chance of interference from co-channel high powered operations. 47. Further, contrary to LMCC's contention, we do not believe that low power users should be required to declare their intent to migrate to low power channels or modify their license to obtain primary status within a certain time frame. We believe the decision whether or not to migrate or obtain primary status is a business decision and best left up to individual licensees to make within their own time frame according to their individual requirements. Additionally, because the designated channels, in some cases, may be the same channels that many low power users are already using, licensees would not be able to make informed decisions regarding migration until channels are designated. Therefore, we decline to require current low power users to declare their intent to migrate to dedicated low power channels or modify their license to obtain primary status by a certain date. 48. We do agree, however, with LMCC's suggestion to give licensees on the low power channels a chance to migrate before licensing high power operations on these channels. The PLMR community believes seven months is a reasonable amount of time for offset licensees to decide whether to switch to new low power channels. Therefore, in this connection, we will provide a period of seven months for low power users to migrate to new low power frequencies. Additionally, concurrent with the end of this migration period we note our intention to lift the current licensing freeze in the 450\u00b1470 MHz band and allow new high power systems to be licensed on any former 12.5 kHz offset channel not specifically designated for low power use. We will not lift the freeze, however, if a consensus plan has not beenestablished. In the interim, we will grant partial relief and permit the licensing of high power systems on these channels, provided that the license applications are accompanied by a statement from the frequency coordinator attesting that operation of a new high powered system will not impact any currently operating co-channel low power system. If interference to a low power system from a high power operator using the offset frequencies does occur prior to the end of the migration period, the high power licensee will be expected to remedy the situation through any means possible, including shutting its system down. 49. In a related matter, PCIA, in its petition for reconsideration, recommends that we allow a six-month transition period for low power licensees to migrate to new low power channels before accepting any new low power applications on the designated channels. We will not adopt such a policy. We believe that it is not in the public interest to keep applicants, especially those who propose to operate in a highly efficient manner ( i.e., with low power), from obtaining licenses on designated low power channels. Additionally, because low power systems have small operating areas, we believe that there should be enough frequencies to accommodate all current and prospective low power licensees. 50. Finally, in its petition for reconsideration, Florida predicts a windfall for frequency coordinators and asks the Commission to reconsider the financial impact of this migration on existing licensees. We acknowledge that coordinators will collect fees from low power licensees when they apply to modify their systems to operate on the dedicated low power frequencies. In light of this, we encourage the coordinators to develop a reasonable fee schedule to reflect the relative ease of this type of coordination as compared to coordinating new high power stations. 51. Conclusion. This Second Report and Order represents a significant step in the evolution of the private land mobile radio services. With its adoption, we are consolidating the PLMR services into two service pools\u00d0Public Safety and Industrial/Business\u00d0while protecting critical safety related communications and providing benefits that are not realizable under the current system. We are also incorporating regulatory changes to the frequency coordination process to provide PLMR users with increased choices and flexibility. These changes reflect a comprehensive restructuring of the PLMR regulatory environment and will promote the highly effective and efficient use of PLMR spectrum and18841 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday /April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations 3Replacement of part 90 by part 88 to Revise the Private Land Mobile Radio Services and Modify the Policies Governing Them, PR Docket 92\u00b1235, Notice of Proposed Rule Making, 7 FCC Rcd 8105 (1992) ( Refarming NPRM ); Replacement of part 90 by part 88 to Revise the Private Land Mobile Radio Services and Modify the Policies Governing Them and Examination of Exclusivity and Frequency Assignments Policies of the Private Land Mobile Radio Services, PR Docket No. 92\u00b1235, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making, 10 FCC Rcd 10076 (1995) ( Report and Order or Further NPRM ). 4Pub.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 52. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603 (RFA), Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analyses (IRFA) were incorporated in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making and the Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in PR Docket 92\u00b1235.3The Commission sought written public comments on the proposals in the Refarming Notice and Further Notice , including on the IRFA. The Commission's Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis ( FRFA) in this Second Report and Order (Second R&O) conforms to the RFA, as amended by the Contract With America Advancement Act of 1996.4 I. Need for and Objective of the Proposed Rule 53. Our objective is to increase spectrum efficiency and facilitate the introduction of advanced technologies into the 150\u00b1174 MHz, 421\u00b1430 MHz, mobile radio (PLMR) bands. The Report and Order in this proceeding modified the Commission's rules to resolve many of the technical issues which inhibited the use of spectrally efficient technologies in these frequency bands. It also stated the Commission's intent to consolidate the twenty existing radio service pools. The Further Notice in this proceeding proposed several methods of introducing market based incentives into the PLMR bands, including exclusivity. This Second R&O consolidates the radio service frequency pools, and addresses related issues such as frequency coordination, trunking, and low power frequencies. 54. We find that the potential benefits to the PLMR community exceed any negative effects that may result from the promulgation of rules for this purpose. Thus, we conclude that the public interest is served by modifying our rules to consolidate the PLMR services andincrease the spectral efficiency of the PLMR bands. II. Summary of Significant Issues Raised by the Public Comments in Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 55. No comments were submitted in direct response to the IRFA. We have, however, reviewed general comments that may impact small businesses. 56. Much of the impact on small businesses arises from the central decision in this proceeding\u00d0the number of frequency pools. Commenters submitted proposals which ranged from keeping the current system in place to consolidating to two pools. This affects small businesses in the following way. A smaller number of pools provides a greater number of frequencies available for small business to use to meet their coordination needs. Additionally, by creating fewer pools, frequency coordinators will now have to compete, thus small business that use PLMR systems could expect to pay lower prices for frequency coordination and receive better service. Finally, consolidating the PLMR services provides each frequency coordinator, who currently only provides service for a narrowly defined type of user, with the ability to expand its business base. III. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities Subject to Which the Rules Apply 57. The rules adopted in this Second Report and Order will apply to small businesses that choose to use radios that operate in the PLMR bands below 512 MHz and to small businesses that are designated as certified frequency coordinators in these bands. There are no Commission imposed requirements, however, for any entity to use these products. Estimates for PLMR Licensees 58. Private land mobile radio system serve an essential role in a vast range of industrial, business, land transportation, and public safety activities. These radios are used by companies of all sizes operating in all U.S. business categories. Because of the vast array of PLMR users, the Commission has not developed nor would it be possible to develop a definition of small entities specifically applicable to PLMR users. For the purpose of determining whether a licensee is a small business as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA), each licensee would need to be evaluated within its own business area. 59. Because the Regulatory Flexibility Act amendments were not in effect until the record in this proceeding wasclosed, the Commission was unable to request information regarding the number of small entities that are private land mobile radio licensees. Therefore, the Commission is unable at this time to determine the number of small businesses which could be impacted by the rules. However, the Commission's fiscal year 1994 annual report indicates that at the end of fiscal year 1994 there were 1,101,711 licensees operating 12,882,623 transmitters in the PLMR bands below 512 MHz.5Further, because any entity engaged in a commercial activity is eligible to hold a PLMR license, these rules could potentially impact every small business in the U.S. 60. The RFA also includes small governmental entities as a part of the regulatory flexibility analysis.6The definition of a small governmental entity is one with a population of less than 50,000.7There are 85,006 governmental entities in the nation.8 This number includes such entities as states, counties, cities, utility districts, and school districts. There are no figures available on what portion of this number has populations of fewer than 50,000. However, this number includes 38,978 counties, cities, and towns, and of those, 37,566, or 96 percent, have populations of fewer than 50,000.9The Census Bureau estimates that this ratio is approximately accurate for all governmental entities. Thus, of the 85,006 governmental entities, we estimate that 96 percent, or 81,600 are small entities that may be affected by our rules. Estimates for Frequency Coordinators 61. Neither the Commission nor the SBA have developed a definition of small entities specifically applicable to spectrum frequency coordinators. Therefore, we conclude that the closest applicable definition under SBA rules is Business Associations (SIC 8611). The SBA defines a small business association as an entity with $5.0 million or less in annual receipts. There are 18 entities certified to perform frequency coordination functions under Part 90 of our rules. However, we are unable to ascertain how many of these frequency coordinators are classified as small entities under the SBA definition. The Census Bureau indicates that 97%18842 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday /April 17, 1997 /Rules and Regulations 10See Coalition ex parte filing of December 20, 1996 in which it states that a concurrence period of ten to twenty days is necessary for in-pool coordinators to object to a specific frequency recommendation. This view is supported by several other commenters. See, e.g., UTC Comments to Blueprint at 13. 11See PCIA Comments to Blueprint at 7\u00b18; ITA ex parte filing of January 6, 1997. 12ITA supports this ten day waiting period. See ITA Reply Comments to Blueprint at 11\u00b112.13See 47 CFR 90.176. 14See, e.g., Joint Pool Comments at 10\u00b111; UTC Comments at 12.of business associations have annual receipts of $4.999 million or less and would be classified as small entities. The Census Bureau category is very broad, and does not include specific figures for firms that are engaged in the coordination of spectrum frequencies. Therefore, for the purposes of this regulatory flexibility analysis, we estimate that almost all of the 18 spectrum frequency coordinators are small as defined by the SBA. IV. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements of the Rules 62. The rules adopted in this Second R&O do not have any general reporting or recordkeeping requirements for PLMR licensees. There is, however, one compliance requirement. Applicants for new or modified PLMR stations will be required to wait ten days prior to commencing operation pursuant to conditional authority. Such a waiting period is necessary to ensure that all in- pool frequency coordinators are notified regarding the proposed system before the applicant starts transmitting. While we want the licensing process to be as quick as possible, we believe all affected coordinators should be aware of a proposed operation before an applicant commences transmitting. Regarding this issue, many commenters identify a need for a mandatory concurrence period.10 Other commenters argue that a mandatory concurrence period is unnecessary.11Rather than a mandatory concurrence period, which we believe could prolong the licensing process, thereby affecting small businesses, we believe the adopted waiting period will accomplish the same goal of providing a method for coordinators to ensure that existing radio systems will not suffer harmful interference from new or modified systems.12 63. Additionally, in the specific instances where licensees want to construct a centralized trunking rather than a traditional system, they must obtain concurrence from nearby affected users and forward such agreements to the applicable frequency coordinator and the Commission as an attachment to the license application form, FCC Form 600. Because of the fundamental differences between trunked andtraditional systems, such action is necessary in order to avoid a licensee from causing harmful interference to other nearby licensees, many of which may be small businesses. 64. There are several reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance requirements applicable to the Commission certified PLMR frequency coordinators. These new requirements are necessary to ensure that each frequency coordinator has access to the information necessary to perform competent frequency coordinations for their customers. (1) Because several frequency coordinators will now be able to recommend frequencies within a common frequency pool, each needs to know the recommendations of each of the other frequency coordinators. Such information is necessary to avoid situations where harmful interference is created because two or more coordinators recommend the same frequency in the same area at approximately the same time to different applicants. Therefore, we are requiring each frequency coordinator to provide, within one business day, a listing of their frequency recommendations to all other frequency coordinators in their respective pool. In this connection, we believe that the importance and need for a current and accurate accounting of frequency recommendations outweighs the burden, if any, on small coordinators. Because coordinators are already required to share information when invoking the interservice sharing rules of our current rules,13each should already have a system in place for such data exchange. Additionally, we believe that the greater harm could occur to small business that are PLMR licensees. Without such data exchange, these licensees' systems could be in danger of receiving harmful interference which would endanger their business operations. The Commission did not receive any specific comments regarding the one-day notification requirement. However, the Commission did receive comments regarding the need for notification.14 (2) In some instances, frequency coordinators need to perform engineering analyses to determine if an applicant's proposed radio system is feasible. A coordinator may need detailed information on systems coordinated by other coordinators in order to perform such an analysis. Therefore, we are requiring that eachcoordinator provide, upon request, within one business day, information requested by another coordinator regarding a pending coordination. (3) To ensure that applicants have access to reliable and competent frequency coordination services regardless of which coordinator they choose to use, we have determined that some minimum technical standards to which each coordinator must adhere need to be established. We are requiring the coordinators to achieve a consensus on such standards within six months of the publication of this Second R&O in the Federal Register . (4) In the Report and Order , the Commission provided frequency coordinators with the authority to designate channels for the exclusive use of low power systems. Coordinators have been reluctant to designate such channels due to uncertainty regarding consolidation. Now that the framework for the frequency pools has been established, we are providing six months from the publication of this Second R&O in the Federal Register for the frequency coordinators to achieve a consensus plan for low power channels. V. Steps Taken by Agency to Minimize Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities Consistent With Stated Objectives 65. The Commission provided the PLMR community with an opportunity to meet and develop a consensus position on this issue as an alternative to the Commission's adoption of final rules for consolidation of the PLMR radio services. Unfortunately, a consensus was not reached, therefore this Report and Order balances the competing interests. 66. The Commission, in this Second R&O , has considered comments regarding its plans to consolidate the PLMR radio services below 512 MHz and those related comments filed pursuant to proposals discussed in the Further NPRM. In doing so, the Commission has adopted several proposals which minimize burdens placed on small entities. First, the Commission has adopted a two pool consolidation plan which will provide more frequency options to entities than the current frequency pool structure and structures based on more than two pools. The increase in frequency choices will provide a greater likelihood that licensees, including small entities, will share frequencies with fewer systems enabling them to achieve more efficiency in their radio systems. Second, by adopting a two pool approach, we are able to eliminate the interservice sharing rules in \u00a7 90.176 of18843 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 1997 /Rules and Regulations 15See 5. U.S.C. 801(a)(1)(A).our rules. Currently, entities who want to use frequencies in a pool other than the one in which they are eligible must invoke these rules and usually are required to pay a frequency coordination fee to the coordinator for their pool and a fee to the coordinator for the pool in which they want to share a frequency. Because entities will now have direct access to all frequencies in their respective pool, this Second R&O eliminates the need for an entity to pay more than one frequency coordination fee for any radio system. Third, because this Second R&O provides for competitive frequency coordination in the Industrial/Business Pool, license applicants should expect a reduction in frequency coordination fees and/or an increase in the level of service. Fourth, under the adopted frequency pool structure, all frequency coordinators will be certified to coordinate frequencies in the pool in which the pool that they previously coordinated is placed. This will minimize confusion and ease the transition process from the current radio service structure to the new consolidated frequency pool structure. Fifth, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the consolidated frequency pools, we are providing a period of six months for entities to implement the rule changes adopted in the Second R&O. Sixth, rather than requiring the frequency coordinators to establish and maintain a common real time database, we are only requiring that they share certain information among themselves. Requiring the development of a common database would be a complex, costly, and time consuming endeavor. Seventh, while we are requiring the sharing of certain data, we are not specifying the method by which this data should be shared. Each frequency coordinator may choose any method that fulfills its requirements with respect to speed, cost, and quality. Eighth, we are providing a method by which licensees can implement a centralized trunking system. Because such systems are more efficient than traditional systems, licensees who implement centralized trunking may be able to achieve the same amount of communications as they currently do with fewer channels.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to clarify the criteria for exempting the use of a substance in human food or in animal feed from the premarket approval requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) because such use is generally recognized as safe (GRAS). FDA is also proposing to replace the current GRAS affirmation process with a notification procedure whereby any person may notify FDA of a determination that a particular use of a substance is GRAS. Under the proposed notification procedure, the agency intends to evaluate whether the submitted notice provides a sufficient basis for a GRAS determination and whether information in the notice or otherwise available to FDA raises issues that lead the agency to question whether use of the substance is GRAS. This proposal reflects FDA's commitment to achieving the goals for the Reinventing Food Regulations part of the President's National Performance Review (hereinafter referred to as Reinventing Food Regulations). The proposed notification procedure would allow FDA to direct its resources to questions about GRAS status that are a priority with respect to public health protection. DATES: Written comments by July 16, 1997, except that comments regarding information collection should be submitted by May 19, 1997. The agency proposes that any final rule that may issue based on this proposal become effective 60 days after its date of publication.

The 1958 Amendment In 1958, in response to public concern about the increased use of chemicals in foods and food processing and with the support of the food industry, Congress enacted the Food Additives Amendment (the 1958 amendment) to the act. The basic thrust of the 1958 amendment was to require that, before a new additive could be used in food, its producer demonstrate the safety of the additive to FDA. The 1958 amendment defined the terms ``food additive'' (section 201(s) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(s))) and ``unsafe food additive'' (section 409(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 348(a))), established a premarket approval process for food additives (section 409(b) through (h)), and amended the food adulteration provisions of the act to deem adulterated any food that is, or bears or contains, any food additive that is unsafe within the meaning of section 409 (section 402(a)(2)(C) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C))). Congress recognized that, under this scheme, the safety of an additive could not be established with absolute certainty, and thus provided for a science-based safety standard that requires producers of food additives to demonstrate to a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the intended use of an additive (Ref. 1). FDA has incorporated this safety standard into its regulations (\u00a7 170.3(i) (21 CFR 170.3(i))). If FDA finds an additive to be safe, based ordinarily on data submitted by the producer to the agency in a food additive petition (FAP), the agency issues a regulation specifying the conditions under which the additive may be safely used. In enacting the 1958 amendment, Congress recognized that many substances intentionally added to food would not require a formal premarket review by FDA to assure their safety, either because their safety had been established by a long history of use in18939 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules food or by virtue of the nature of the substances, their customary or projected conditions of use, and the information generally available to scientists about the substances. Congress thus adopted, in section 201(s) of the act, a two-step definition of ``food additive.'' The first step broadly includes any substance, the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food. The second step, however, excludes from the definition of ``food additive'' substances that are generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate their safety (``qualified experts''), as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures (or, in the case of a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, through either scientific procedures or through experience based on common use in food) to be safe under the conditions of their intended use. Importantly, under section 201(s) of the act, it is the use of a substance, rather than the substance itself, that is eligible for the GRAS exemption. In addition, it is well settled that a mere showing that use of a substance is ``safe'' is not sufficient to exempt the substance from the act's definition of ``food additive'' ( United States v. An Article of Food * ** Coco Rico, Inc. , 752 F.2d 11, 15 n. 4 (1st Cir. 1985)). Instead, the substance must be shown to be ``generally recognized'' as safe under the conditions of its intended use ( Id.; United States v. Articles of Food and Drug * * * Coli-Trol 80 , 518 F.2d 743, 745 (5th Cir. 1975)). The proponent of the exemption has the burden of proving that the use of the substance is ``generally recognized'' as safe ( Id). To establish such recognition, the proponent must show that there is a consensus of expert opinion regarding the safety of the use of the substance. (See United States v. Western Serum Co., Inc. , 666 F.2d 335, 338 (9th Cir. 1982); United States v. Articles of Drug * * * Promise Toothpaste , 624 F.Supp. 776, 778 (N.D. Ill. 1985), aff'd 826 F.2d 564 (7th Cir. 1987); United States v. Articles of Drug * * * Hormonin , 498 F.Supp.2d 424, 435 (D.N.J. 1980).) Unanimity among experts regarding safety of a substance is not required. (See United States v. Articles of Drug * * * 5,906 boxes , 745 F.2d 105, 119 n. 22 (1st Cir. 1984); United States v. An Article of Drug * ** 4,680 Pails , 725 F.2d at 782.)However, the existence of a severe conflict among experts regarding the safety of the use of a substance precludes a finding of general recognition , F.2d supra , 518 F.2d at 746 (mere conflict among experts is not enough to preclude a finding of general recognition)). It is on the basis of the GRAS exemption to the food additive definition that many substances (such as vinegar, vegetable oil, baking powder, and many salts, spices, flavors, gums, and preservatives) are lawfully marketed today without a food additive regulation. Under the 1958 amendment, a substance that is GRAS for a particular use may be marketed for that use without agency review and approval. However, when a use of a substance does not qualify for the GRAS exemption or other exemptions provided under section 201(s) of the act, that use of the substance is a food additive use subject to the premarket approval mandated by the act. In such circumstances, the agency can take enforcement action to stop distribution of the food substance and foods containing it on the grounds that such foods are or contain an unlawful food additive. Importantly, under section 201(s) of the act, the GRAS exemption applies to the premarket approval requirements for food additives only. There is no corresponding exemption to the premarket approval requirements for color additives, which are defined in section 201(t) of the act. B. History of FDA's Approach to the GRAS Exemption 1. The GRAS List Shortly after passage of the 1958 amendment, FDA clarified the regulatory status of a multitude of food substances that were used in food prior to 1958 and amended its regulations to include a list of food substances that, when used for the purposes indicated and in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, are GRAS. This list was incorporated into the agency's regulations as \u00a7 121.101(d) (now parts 182 and 582 (21 CFR parts 182 and 582)) (24 FR 9368, November 20, 1959). As part of that rulemaking, however, FDA acknowledged that it would be impracticable to list all substances that are GRAS for their intended use (formerly \u00a7 121.101(a); current \u00a7 182.1(a)). Section 121.101(d) became commonly referred to as ``the GRAS list.'' FDAadded other categories of substances (e.g., spices, seasonings, and flavorings) to the GRAS list in subsequent rulemakings (25 FR 404, January 19, 1960; and 26 FR 3991, May 9, 1961). 2. Opinion Letters Many substances that were considered GRAS by the food industry were not included in the agency's GRAS list. Under the 1958 amendment, a substance that is GRAS for a particular use may be marketed for that use without agency review and approval. Nonetheless, as a practical matter, manufacturers who determined on their own initiative that use of a substance qualified for the GRAS exemption frequently decided to obtain the agency's opinion on whether their determination was justified. Many manufacturers wrote to FDA and requested an ``opinion letter,'' in which agency officials would render an informal opinion on the GRAS status of use of a substance. Although convenient and expedient, these opinion letters were often available only to the requestor. Moreover, these opinion letters were not binding on the agency at the time they were issued and were in fact formally revoked in 1970 (21 CFR 170.6, 35 FR 5810, April 9, 1970). 3. Agency-Initiated GRAS Review In 1969 (34 FR 17063, October 21, 1969), FDA removed various cyclamate salts, a family of nonnutritive sweeteners, from the GRAS list because they were implicated in the formation of bladder tumors in rats (Ref. 2). In response to the concerns raised by the new information on cyclamates, then- President Nixon directed FDA to reexamine the safety of GRAS substances (Ref. 3), and FDA announced that the agency was conducting a comprehensive study of substances presumed to be GRAS (35 FR 18623, December 8, 1970). The purpose of the study was to evaluate, by contemporary standards, the available safety information regarding substances presumed to be GRAS and to issue each item in a new (i.e., affirmed) GRAS list, a food additive regulation, or an interim food additive regulation pending completion of additional studies. 4. GRAS Criteria and the GRAS Affirmation Process In the notice announcing the comprehensive agency review of presumed GRAS substances, FDA proposed criteria that could be used to establish whether these substances should be listed as GRAS, become the subject of a food additive regulation, or be listed in an interim food additive18940 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules 1In issuing a food additive regulation, the agency considers technical evidence of safety but does not address the GRAS standard of general recognition. Thus, in most cases, the agency's issuance of a food additive regulation means that FDA did not consider the possible GRAS status of that substance. In a few cases (e.g., 21 CFR 173.357, cellulose triacetate used as a fixing agent in the immobilization of lactase enzyme preparation), FDA concluded, in evaluating the GRAS status of a substance, that the safety of a use of a substance was not generally recognized and authorized its use as a food additive rather than affirm it as GRAS (59 FR 36935, July 20, 1994).regulation pending completion of additional studies (35 FR 18623). These criteria were incorporated into the agency's regulations as \u00a7 121.3 (precursor CFR 170.30)) (36 FR 12093, June 25, 1971). FDA made a second announcement that it was conducting a study of presumed GRAS substances (36 FR 20546, October 23, 1971) and subsequently instituted a rulemaking to establish procedures that the agency could use, on its own initiative, to affirm the GRAS status of substances that were the subject of that review and were found to satisfy the criteria established in \u00a7 121.3 (proposed rule, 37 FR 6207, March 25, 1972; final rule, 37 FR 25705, December 2, 1972). These procedures were subsequently codified at \u00a7170.35 (a) and (b) (21 CFR 170.35 (a) and (b)). Because the GRAS review did not cover all GRAS substances (e.g., it did not cover many substances that were marketed based on a manufacturer's independent GRAS determination), that rulemaking included a mechanism (the current GRAS petition process; \u00a7 170.35(c)) whereby an individual could petition FDA to review the GRAS status of substances not being considered as part of the agency's GRAS review. In 1974, the agency proposed to clarify the criteria for GRAS status, the differences between GRAS status and food additive status, and the procedures being used to conduct the current review of food substances (39 FR 34194, September 23, 1974). The final regulations based on this proposal amended \u00a7 121.3 (current \u00a7 170.30) to distinguish a determination of GRAS status through scientific procedures (scientific procedures GRAS determination; current \u00a7 170.30(b)) from a determination of GRAS status through experience based on common use in food (common use GRAS determination; current \u00a7 170.30(c)) (41 FR 53600, December 7, 1976). Those final regulations also established definitions for ``common use in food'' (current \u00a7170.3(f)) and ``scientific 170.3(h)). FDA subsequently added criteria (\u00a7 170.30(c)(2)) for the determination of GRAS status through experience based on common use in food when that use occurred exclusively or primarily outside of the United States (53 FR 16544, May 10, 1988). 5. The Plant Policy Statement FDA's ``Statement of Policy: Foods Derived From New Plant Varieties'' (the plant policy statement) (57 FR 22984, May 29, 1992) is an example of a recent agency policy announcement regarding agency priorities in reviewing the GRASstatus of substances added to food. In the plant policy statement, FDA reviewed its position on the applicability of the food additive definition and section 409 of the act to foods derived from new plant varieties in light of the intended changes in the composition of foods that might result from the newer techniques of genetic modification such as recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) techniques: The statutory definition of ``food additive'' makes clear that it is the intended or expected introduction of a substance into food that makes the substance potentially subject to food additive regulation. Thus, in the case of foods derived from new plant varieties, it is the transferred genetic material and the intended expression product or products that could be subject to food additive regulation, if such material or expression products are not GRAS. (57 FR 22984 at 22990) In the plant policy statement, FDA provided extensive guidance, including criteria and analytical steps that producers could follow, on situations in which producers should consult with FDA to determine whether an FAP is appropriate. FDA also stated its intent to use its food additive authority in regulating foods and their byproducts derived from new plant varieties to the extent necessary to protect public health. C. Elements of the GRAS Standard Under section 201(s) of the act, a substance is exempt from the definition of food additive and thus, from premarket approval requirements, if its safety is generally recognized by qualified experts. Accordingly, a determination that a particular use of a substance is GRAS requires both technical evidence of safety and a basis to conclude that this technical evidence of safety is generally known and accepted. In contrast, a determination that a food additive is safe requires only technical evidence of safety.1Thus, a GRAS substance is distinguished from a food additive on the basis of the common knowledge about the safety of the substance for its intended use rather than on the basis of what the substanceis or the types of data and information that are necessary to establish its safety. To emphasize this distinction between a GRAS substance and a food additive, and to simplify discussion about the standard for general recognition of safety, in this document, FDA uses the term ``technical element'' when discussing technical evidence of safety and ``common knowledge element'' when discussing general knowledge and acceptance of safety. The technical element of the GRAS standard requires that information about the substance establish that the intended use of the substance is safe. As discussed in section I.A of this document, FDA has defined ``safe'' (\u00a7170.3(i)) as a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under its intended conditions of use. Current \u00a7170.30(b) provides that general recognition of safety through scientific procedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive. Similarly, current \u00a7 170.30(c)(1) provides that general recognition of safety through experience based on common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, may be determined without the quantity or quality of scientific procedures required for approval of a food additive regulation and must be based solely on food use of the substance prior to that date. Current \u00a7 170.3(f) defines ``common use in food'' as a substantial history of consumption for food use by a significant number of consumers. The common knowledge element of the GRAS standard includes two facets: (1) The data and information relied on to establish the technical element must be generally available; and (2) there must be a basis to conclude that there is consensus among qualified experts about the safety of the substance for its intended use. Neither facet is, by itself, sufficient to satisfy the common knowledge element of the GRAS standard. The usual mechanism to establish that scientific information is generally available is to show that the information is published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. However, mechanisms to establish the basis for concluding that there is expert consensus about the safety of a substance are more varied. In some cases, publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal of data (such as toxicity studies) on a test substance has been used to establish expert consensus in addition to general availability. In other cases, such publication of data and information in the primary18941 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules scientific literature has been supplemented by: (1) Publication of data and information in the secondary scientific literature, such as scientific review articles, textbooks, and compendia; (2) documentation of the opinion of an ``expert panel'' that is specifically convened for this purpose; or (3) the opinion or recommendation of an authoritative body such as the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) or the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics (CON/ AAP) on a broad or specific issue that is related to a GRAS determination. In this document, FDA is using the term ``consensus'' in discussing the common knowledge element of the GRAS standard. Such consensus does not require unanimity among qualified experts ( 5,906 boxes, supra, 745 F.2d 624 F.Supp. at 782). For example, FDA would evaluate a single published report questioning the safety of use of a substance in food in the context of all the publicly available and corroborative information rather than conclude that such a report automatically disqualifies the substance from satisfying the GRAS standard ( Cf. Coli-Trol 80, supra, 518 F.2d at 746). D. The GRAS Petition Process The rulemaking process in \u00a7 170.35(c) whereby manufacturers may petition FDA to affirm that a substance is GRAS under certain conditions of use was designed as a voluntary administrative process whose purpose was to provide a mechanism for official recognition of lawfully made GRAS determinations. To the extent that a person elected to submit a GRAS petition, the process could facilitate an awareness, by the agency as well as the domestic and international food industry, of independent GRAS determinations. However, GRAS affirmation involves the resource-intensive rulemaking process, including: (1) Publishing a filing notice in the Federal Register ; (2) requesting comment on the petitioned request; (3) conducting a comprehensive review of the petition's data and information and comments received to the filing notice to determine whether the evidence establishes that the petitioned use of the substance is GRAS; (4) drafting a detailed explanation of why the use is GRAS (as opposed to simply being safe); and (5) publishing that explanation in the Federal Register . FDA believes that, in practice, this resource-intensive process deters many persons from petitioning the agency toaffirm their independent GRAS determinations. II. Scope of the Proposed Regulations Based on its experience applying the provisions of \u00a7 170.30, FDA is proposing to clarify when use of a substance is exempt from the act's premarket approval requirements because such use is GRAS. In proposing these changes, FDA is: (1) Emphasizing that a GRAS substance is distinguished from a food additive by the common knowledge about the safety of the substance for its intended use rather than by what the substance is, or on the basis of the types of data and information that are necessary to establish its safety; (2) identifying the types of technical evidence of safety that could form the basis of a GRAS determination; and (3) clarifying the role of publication in satisfying the general recognition standard. For consistency with the proposed changes to \u00a7 170.30, FDA is also proposing to amend the definition in \u00a7170.3(h) of ``scientific procedures.'' In addition, in keeping with the Reinventing Food Regulations, FDA is proposing to replace the current GRAS affirmation petition process (\u00a7 170.35(c)) with a notification procedure (proposed \u00a7170.36) whereby any person may notify FDA of a determination that a particular use of a substance is GRAS. The submitted notice would include a ``GRAS exemption claim'' that would provide specific information about a GRAS determination in a consistent format. This GRAS exemption claim would include a succinct description of the ``notified substance'' (i.e., the substance that is the subject of the notice), the applicable conditions of use, and the basis for the GRAS determination (i.e., through scientific procedures or through experience based on common use in food) and would be dated and signed by the notifier. The GRAS exemption claim also would include a statement that the information supporting the GRAS determination was available for FDA review and copying or would be sent to FDA upon request. In addition to the GRAS exemption claim, the notice would include detailed information about the identity and properties of the notified substance and a detailed discussion of the basis for the notifier's GRAS determination. Under the proposed notification procedure, the agency intends to evaluate whether the notice provides a sufficient basis for a GRAS determination and whether information in the notice or otherwise available to FDA raises issues that lead the agency to question whether use of the substance is GRAS. Within 90 days of receipt ofthe notice, FDA would respond to the notifier in writing and could advise the notifier that the agency has identified a problem with the notice. Although information in a notice would be publicly available consistent with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), FDA would make readily accessible to the public the notice's GRAS exemption claim, as well as the agency's response to the notice. However, FDA does not intend to conduct its own detailed evaluation of the data that the notifier relies on to support a determination that a use of a substance is GRAS or to affirm that a substance is GRAS for its intended use. FDA has tentatively concluded that the proposed notification procedure has advantages over the current petition process because the resource-intensive rulemaking that is associated with a petition would be eliminated. This streamlining would allow FDA to redirect its resources to questions about GRAS status that are a priority with respect to public health protection. In addition, the proposed notice is simpler than a GRAS affirmation petition and therefore conceivably would provide an incentive for manufacturers to inform FDA of their GRAS determinations. This would result in increased agency awareness of the composition of the nation's food supply and the cumulative dietary exposure to GRAS substances. FDA has also tentatively concluded that the public health would be better served if some resources that are currently directed to the GRAS petition process were redirected to the preparation of documents that would provide the industry with guidance on certain food safety issues for complex substances (e.g., macroingredients or biological polymers, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats and oils). Finally, the reduction in resources devoted to the evaluation of GRAS substances would allow FDA to shift resources to its statutorily mandated task of reviewing food and color additive petitions. In light of its experience in reviewing GRAS petitions, FDA believes that the substitution of the proposed notification procedure for the current GRAS petition process would not adversely affect the public health because the agency would be replacing one voluntary administrative process with a different voluntary administrative procedure that would utilize FDA's resources more effectively and efficiently. Under both the current and the proposed procedures, a manufacturer may market a substance that the manufacturer determines is GRAS without informing the agency or, if the agency is so18942 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules informed, while the agency is reviewing that information. Thus, from a legal and regulatory perspective, this substitution is neutral. FDA is also proposing to remove \u00a7170.30(f), which expresses the agency's intent to review the GRAS status of certain food substances, because \u00a7 170.30(f) is redundant with the provisions of \u00a7 170.35 (a) and (b) that the agency may, on its own initiative, affirm the GRAS status of substances that directly or indirectly become components of food (\u00a7170.35(a)) or publish a notice announcing its conclusion that there is a lack of convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS and that it should be considered a food additive (\u00a7 170.35(b)). FDA's regulations regarding the eligibility of substances used in animal food or feeds for classification as GRAS, and the procedures for affirmation of GRAS status for such substances, are codified at \u00a7\u00a7 570.30 and 570.35 (21 CFR 570.30 and 570.35), respectively. FDA is proposing the following: (1) To amend the provisions of \u00a7 570.30 that are parallel to the provisions of current \u00a7170.30 (i.e., \u00a7 570.30 (a) and (b)); (2) to eliminate the GRAS affirmation petition process provided for in \u00a7 570.35 (a) and (c); and (3) to provide the option of a GRAS notification procedure for animal food or feeds that would be parallel to proposed \u00a7 170.36. FDA is proposing these changes because the regulations in part 570 (21 CFR part 570) implement the same statutory provisions as the regulations in part 170 (21 CFR part 170). Finally, FDA is proposing to make certain conforming amendments to \u00a7\u00a7170.38, 184.1, 186.1, and 570.38. As FDA gains experience with the questions raised by industry in preparing notices, FDA expects, from time to time, to prepare guidance documents on issues of particular interest. However, such guidance documents are not a subject of this proposal. III. Proposed Revisions to \u00a7 170.30\u00d0 Eligibility for Classification as GRAS A. General Criteria FDA is proposing to expand the description of the general criteria provided in current \u00a7 170.30(a) for a GRAS determination. FDA is not proposing any changes to the first two sentences of current \u00a7 170.30(a), which reflect the language of the GRAS exemption as set out in section 201(s) of the act. The final sentence of current \u00a7170.30(a) provides that general recognition of safety requires that therebe common knowledge about the substance throughout the scientific community knowledgeable about the safety of substances directly or indirectly added to food. FDA is proposing to amend this provision to define what that common knowledge is (i.e., that there is reasonable certainty that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use). In other words, proposed \u00a7 170.30(a) would clarify that the safety standard for a GRAS substance is identical to the safety standard in \u00a7 170.3(i) and that a GRAS substance is neither more safe nor less safe than an approved food additive. Rather, the distinction between a GRAS substance and an approved food additive is that, for a GRAS substance, there is common knowledge of safety within the expert community. B. Scientific Procedures GRAS Determination 1. Establishing General Recognition of Safety Current \u00a7 170.30(b) describes the technical element of a scientific procedures GRAS determination (i.e., that it requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive). Current \u00a7170.30(b) also describes the common knowledge element of a scientific procedures GRAS determination (i.e., that it ordinarily is based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information). FDA is proposing two changes to the description of the common knowledge element in current \u00a7 170.30(b). First, FDA is proposing to broaden this description to clarify the types of technical evidence of safety (currently described only as ``studies'') that could form the basis of a GRAS determination. FDA is proposing this change because the quantity and quality of scientific evidence required to obtain approval of a substance as a food additive vary considerably depending upon the estimated dietary exposure to the substance and the chemical, physical, and physiological properties of the substance; there can likewise be a comparable variation in the scientific evidence that forms the basis of a GRAS determination. Second, FDA is proposing to amend this description to clarify the role of publication in satisfying the common knowledge element. FDA is proposing this change because publication is ordinarily required, but may not always be sufficient, to satisfy the commonknowledge element of the GRAS standard. Specifically, FDA is proposing to revise \u00a7 170.30(b) to provide that general recognition of safety through scientific procedures be based upon generally available and accepted scientific data, information, methods, or principles, which ordinarily are published. Thus, under proposed \u00a7 170.30(b), ``studies'' would be one of several types of scientific ``data and information'' that could support the technical element of a scientific procedures GRAS determination. However, depending on the circumstances, other scientific data and scientific information such as that relating to chemical identity or characteristic properties of a substance, as well as methods of manufacture, could support, and in some cases be sufficient to satisfy that element. In addition, under this proposed revision of \u00a7 170.30(b), generally available and accepted scientific principles could be applied to, and relied on as part of, the technical element of a scientific procedures GRAS determination. Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language defines a ``principle'' as ``a fundamental truth, law, doctrine or motivating force upon which others are based.'' For example, the common scientific principle ``the dose makes the poison,'' underlies a determination that a substance is safe for use in food at certain levels even if it exhibits toxicity when present at higher levels. A related scientific principle is that the toxicity of a substance may vary between animal species. FDA relies on both of these scientific principles when determining whether the proposed use of a substance added to food is safe within the meaning of section 409 of the act. For consistency with this proposed amendment, FDA is also proposing to amend the current definition of ``scientific procedures'' in \u00a7 170.3(h). Under the current definition, scientific procedures include those human, animal, analytical, and other scientific studies, whether published or unpublished, appropriate to establish the safety of a substance. FDA is proposing to amend \u00a7 170.3(h) by broadening it so that scientific procedures would include scientific data (such as human, animal, analytical, and other scientific studies), information, methods, or principles, whether published or unpublished, appropriate to establish the safety of a substance. In both this proposed definition and the proposed amendment to \u00a7170.30(b), the descriptor ``scientific'' applies equally to ``data,''18943 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules ``information,'' ``methods,'' and ``principles.'' FDA is proposing to clarify the role of publication in satisfying the common knowledge element of the GRAS standard by adding the phrases ``generally available and accepted'' and ``which ordinarily are published'' as descriptors of ``scientific data, information, methods, or principles'' in proposed \u00a7 170.30(b). Thus, under proposed \u00a7 170.30(b), publication of data and information about a GRAS substance is usually necessary, but may not always be sufficient, to satisfy the common knowledge element of the GRAS standard. The descriptor ``which ordinarily are published'' reflects that the usual mechanism to establish that scientific information is generally available is to show that the information is published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. This descriptor maintains the explicit emphasis of current \u00a7 170.30(b) on the importance of publication in satisfying the common knowledge element. However, current \u00a7 170.30(b) does not explicitly emphasize the second facet of the common knowledge element (i.e., that there is a basis to conclude that there is the requisite expert consensus that the generally available data and information establish the safety of the substance for its intended use). For example, there could be a basis to conclude that there is expert consensus that the published results of a particular safety study (i.e., the primary scientific literature) establish the safety of a substance for its intended use if the study raises no safety questions that experts would need to interpret and resolve. On the other hand, the published results of a particular safety study may not be sufficient to satisfy the common knowledge element if the study raises safety questions that require additional data to be resolved. In such cases, the general recognition standard usually requires more than a publication in the primary scientific literature. As mentioned, the basis for concluding that there is expert consensus historically has included publication in secondary sources, convening an expert panel, or relying on an opinion or recommendation of an authoritative body. The body of information published in secondary sources (such as review articles, articles describing scientific methods, general reference materials, and textbooks) can be more useful than the primary scientific literature for showing a basis for a conclusion that the necessary expert consensus exists because the existence of the secondary sources implies that the primaryscientific literature has been evaluated after its publication. For example, FDA sometimes relies on generally available and accepted compendia such as Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (Ref. 4) when evaluating the common knowledge element of the GRAS standard for food substances derived from a bacterial source. The opinion of a specially-convened expert panel can provide a basis for showing expert consensus when an individual published study raises safety questions. The opinion of an expert panel is also useful when multiple studies bearing on the safety of a substance are published but there are no secondary sources that evaluate these studies and draw general conclusions based on this comprehensive body of knowledge. For example, during the agency-initiated GRAS review, FDA commissioned, through the Life Sciences Research Office of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, the ``Select Committee on GRAS Substances'' (the Select Committee). The charge to the Select Committee was to summarize the available scientific literature and to provide a recommendation as to what restrictions, if any, on the use of the substance would be needed to ensure its safe use in food. In FDA's view, the common knowledge element of the GRAS standard precludes a GRAS determination if the data and information evaluated by such an expert panel are only available in files that are not publicly accessible, such as in confidential industry files. For example, in response to GRAS petitions requesting that FDA affirm the GRAS status of lactase from Kluyveromyces lactis entrapped in cellulose triacetate fibers for use in reducing the lactose content of milk, FDA affirmed that the lactase enzyme was GRAS (49 FR 47384, December 4, 1984) but issued a food additive regulation authorizing the secondary direct food additive use of cellulose triacetate as an immobilizing agent because the information that the petitioner relied on to establish the safety of the cellulose triacetate was not generally available (59 FR 36935, July 20, 1994). The opinions or recommendations of an authoritative body such as NAS or CON/AAP frequently bear on an issue that is related to a GRAS determination. For example, CON/AAP may recommend the use in infant formula of a food substance whose regulatory status is not explicitly identified in FDA's regulations. Similarly, NAS's Recommended Dietary Allowances (Ref. 5) are useful in establishing the safelevel of an added nutrient source in foods, particularly when the safe level of intake is a narrow range because the difference between the recommended dietary intake and the intake at which the substance exhibits toxic properties is small. In cases such as these, the opinions or recommendations of the authoritative body may provide a basis for concluding that there is expert consensus regarding the safety of a substance for its intended use in food. 2. Corroboration of Safety FDA is proposing to retain the concept in current \u00a7 170.30(b) that unpublished data and information that bear on safety may be used to corroborate published data and information that establish general recognition of safety. FDA is proposing to amend current \u00a7 170.30(b) by removing the phrase ``unpublished studies and other data and information'' and substituting the phrase ``unpublished scientific data, information, or methods.'' This proposed revision is comparable to the proposed broadening of the description of the common knowledge element of the GRAS standard and likewise reflects the variation in the nature of the scientific evidence that would be required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive. C. Common Use GRAS Determination FDA is not proposing any changes to current \u00a7 170.30(c)(1), which sets out criteria for a common use GRAS determination. However, FDA is proposing to amend current \u00a7170.30(c)(2), which sets out these criteria in the more narrow circumstance of that use occurring exclusively or primarily outside of the United States. FDA is proposing to revise the final sentence of current \u00a7170.30(c)(2) by replacing the recommendation that persons who claim GRAS status on such basis obtain FDA concurrence that the use of the substance is GRAS ( i.e., through submission of a GRAS affirmation petition) with a recommendation that persons who assert such a claim for a substance notify FDA of that claim in accordance with proposed \u00a7 170.36. This revision is a necessary conforming amendment because, as discussed in sections V and VI of this document, FDA is proposing to replace the current affirmation process in \u00a7 170.35(c)(1) with a notification procedure (proposed \u00a7170.36). The recommendation in proposed \u00a7 170.30(c)(2) is appropriate because notice will facilitate the lawful entry of GRAS substances into the United States. FDA will be aware that a18944 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules substance offered for import is the subject of a GRAS exemption claim and will also be aware of the basis for such claim. Absent notice, the substance may appear to be adulterated and thus, be detained under section 801(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)). Therefore, it is prudent for an individual who claims that a substance is GRAS through experience based on its common use in food outside of the United States to notify FDA of that claim. The language of proposed \u00a7 170.30(c)(2) is comparable to the language of current \u00a7 170.30(c)(2) in that it is not a requirement. D. Other Provisions of Current \u00a7 170.30 FDA is not proposing any changes to the remainder of current \u00a7 170.30, except \u00a7 170.30(f) as discussed below, because the changes that the agency is proposing in this document require no conforming amendments to those sections. Current \u00a7 170.30(f) was issued under the auspices of the agency-initiated GRAS review (36 FR 12093, June 25, 1971) and expresses the agency's intent to review the GRAS status of certain food substances. As discussed in section V of this document), FDA is proposing to remove the provision in \u00a7 170.35(a) that the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner), on the petition of an interested person, may affirm the GRAS status of substances that directly or indirectly become components of food. The agency is proposing to retain, however, the provision in \u00a7 170.35(a) that the Commissioner, on his/her own initiative, may affirm the GRAS status of such substances. In addition, the agency is proposing no changes to the provision in \u00a7170.35(b) that if the Commissioner concludes that there is a lack of convincing evidence that a substance is GRAS and that it should be considered a food additive, he/she shall publish a notice thereof in the Federal Register in accordance with \u00a7 170.38. Therefore, \u00a7170.30(f) is redundant with \u00a7 170.35 (a) and (b). Accordingly, in keeping with the agency's goals for the Reinventing Food Regulations, FDA is proposing to remove current \u00a7 170.30(f). IV. The Technical Element of a GRAS Determination Through Scientific Procedures A GRAS substance is distinguished from a food additive on the basis of the common knowledge about the safety of the substance for its intended use rather than on the basis of what the substance is or the types of data and information that are necessary to establish its safety. Nonetheless, FDA is frequently asked about the types of data and informationthat are appropriate to establish the safety of a GRAS substance. Accordingly, FDA discusses below two topics that pertain to the technical element of a scientific procedures GRAS determination: (1) The importance of dietary exposure; and (2) the role of substantial equivalence. A. Consideration of Dietary Exposure Section 409(c)(5) of the act requires that, in evaluating the proposed use of a food additive, FDA consider the probable consumption of the substance and of any substance formed in or on food because of its use, as well as the cumulative effect of the substance in the diet, taking into account any chemically or pharmacologically related substance or substances in such diet. FDA has incorporated this requirement into the definition of ``safe'' and ``safety'' with respect to substances added to food (\u00a7170.3(i)). Thus, the technical element of a scientific procedures GRAS determination must consider the probable consumption and cumulative effect of the substance in the diet because a scientific procedures GRAS determination requires the same quantity and quality of evidence as is required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive. If the dietary exposure to the substance under the intended conditions of use presents a basis for concern about the safety of its use, data or information addressing those concerns are necessary to satisfy the technical element. As with other data and information that support a GRAS determination, data or information addressing a safety question raised by dietary exposure must also satisfy the common knowledge element by being generally available to, and accepted by, qualified experts. In some cases, dietary exposure is unlikely to present a basis for a safety concern. For example, dietary exposure to an enzyme preparation that is derived from a controlled fermentation of a nonpathogenic, nontoxigenic microorganism that does not produce antibiotics, and that is processed using substances that are acceptable for use in foods generally, would not ordinarily present a basis for a safety concern. On the other hand, consumption of a component of a commonly consumed food may present a basis for a safety concern if the dietary exposure to the isolated component under its intended conditions of use is many times greater than its dietary exposure when consumed as a component of food. For example, a fiber may be extracted from a vegetable that has a relatively low dietary exposure (such as beets) and added, at the same level, to other foodsthat have a relatively high dietary exposure. The probable cumulative intake of the fiber likely will be many times higher from the consumption of the foods to which it is added than from the consumption of beets. The probable intake of the fiber from consumption of foods to which it is added may present a basis for a safety concern, especially if the foods containing the added beet fiber will not replace beets in the diet. Likewise, in the case of a chemically synthesized substance that is structurally identical to a naturally occurring substance in commonly consumed food, technical evidence of safety would include consideration of whether the cumulative exposure to both the synthetic and the natural substance exceeds the exposure to the natural substance and whether the combined exposure presents a basis for a safety concern. B. Substantial Equivalence to a GRAS Substance A report of a joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) consultation (the 1996 FAO/WHO report) recommended that ``[s]afety assessment based on the concept of substantial equivalence * * * be applied in establishing the safety of foods and food components derived from genetically modified organisms'' (Ref. 6). The 1996 FAO/WHO report stated that: [s]ubstantial equivalence embodies the concept that if a new food or food component is found to be substantially equivalent to an existing food or food component, it can be treated in the same manner with respect to safety (i.e. the food or food component can be concluded to be as safe as the conventional food or food component). Account should be taken of any processing that the food or food component may undergo as well as the intended use and the intake by the population. The 1996 FAO/WHO report relied, in part, on previous expert reports that had discussed the concept of substantial equivalence, including the 1990 joint FAO/WHO consultation, ``[s]trategies for assessing the safety of foods produced by biotechnology'' (Ref. 7); a report prepared by an expert group of the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD), ``[s]afety evaluation of foods produced by modern biotechnology: Concepts and principles'' (Ref. 8); and a report of a WHO workshop, ``[a]pplication of the principles of substantial equivalence to the safety evaluation of foods or food components from plants derived by modern biotechnology'' (Ref. 9).18945 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules 2In the plant policy statement, FDA used the term ``substantial similarity,'' rather than ``substantial equivalence,'' to avoid possible confusion with the agency's use of the concept of ``substantial equivalence'' with respect to the premarket notification process for medical devices. For consistency with current thinking from international expert groups such as the FAO/WHO and OECD consultation groups, FDA is now using the term ``substantial equivalence'' with respect to food products.FDA believes that in certain instances the concept of substantial equivalence may have applicability to the technical element of a GRAS determination, and the agency has already applied this concept when evaluating the safety of new or modified food substances. For example, the agency's approach (57 FR 22984 and Ref. 10) to assessing the safety of foods derived from new plant varieties, including the safety of newly introduced substances in the food (primarily proteins, carbohydrates, and fatty acids) and unintended changes in the food's composition, is similar to the concept of substantial equivalence posited by FAO, WHO, and OECD.2As another example, FDA has applied this concept in affirming the GRAS status of several microbially-derived chymosin (i.e., rennet) enzyme preparations 1992; 58 May enzyme preparations (60 FR 32904 at 32911, June 26, 1995). However, the concept of substantial equivalence may be of minimal relevance in circumstances where the differences between two substances outweigh the similarities. Thus, a critical factor that must be considered when applying the concept of substantial equivalence is any difference in composition or characteristic properties between the substances being compared. In the example of a microbially-derived enzyme preparation, its principal enzyme component may show substantial equivalence in structure and function to that of a GRAS enzyme preparation derived from an animal source but exhibit different properties such as specific activity (i.e., the rate at which the enzyme catalyzes a reaction) or optimum reaction conditions of pH and temperature because of changes, either through natural selection or through selective chemical modification, in the particular amino acid sequence of the enzyme's active site. Such differences, which are common when comparing enzyme preparations derived from different sources, generally do not outweigh the similarities between the enzyme preparations.On the other hand, the product resulting from the chemical reaction of two or more GRAS substances is a discrete new substance that may have properties that are distinctly different from the individual GRAS substances from which it is synthesized or from a simple mixture of those GRAS substances. The concept of substantial equivalence may not be relevant here unless the reaction product is widely recognized to be metabolized in the same way as the individual components from which it is synthesized. Likewise, in the case of a chemically synthesized substance that is structurally identical to a naturally occurring substance in commonly consumed food, compositional differences between the synthesized and naturally occurring substance may include the presence of any residues of potentially harmful chemicals carried over to the synthetic substance from the manufacturing process. FDA invites comment on the applicability of the concept of substantial equivalence to the technical element of a GRAS determination. V. Proposed Revisions to \u00a7 170.35\u00d0 Affirmation of GRAS Status As a result of the agency's experience in processing FAP's and GRAS affirmation petitions, FDA has tentatively concluded that the petition process, which is the statutorily mandated process for food additives, should no longer be applied to GRAS substances, where the conditions of safe use of a substance have already been recognized by qualified experts. FDA believes that the lengthy rulemaking associated with the GRAS petition process deters many persons who independently determine that use of a substance is GRAS from informing the agency of such determinations. Moreover, FDA believes that the current commitment of its resources to the GRAS petition process provides limited public health benefit because manufacturers who submit an affirmation petition frequently market the substance at issue before FDA reaches a decision on the GRAS status of its intended use. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to amend current \u00a7 170.35(a) to remove the provision that FDA may review the GRAS status of a substance added to food in response to a petition from an interested party. FDA has tentatively concluded that the elimination of the GRAS petition process would not adversely affect public health because the agency is simultaneously proposing to establish a notification procedure for GRAS substances. FDA has alsotentatively concluded that the proposed notification procedure, discussed more fully in section VI of this document, would allow the agency to direct its resources to the more significant questions about GRAS status. Proposed \u00a7 170.35(a) would continue to provide a mechanism whereby FDA, on its own initiative, may affirm the GRAS status of the use of a substance that directly or indirectly becomes a component of food. FDA proposes to retain the option of agency-initiated affirmations for those circumstances where such action is necessary or useful. For example, FDA may propose to revise an existing regulation affirming the GRAS status of a use of a substance if the agency determines that the current regulation is confusing or unnecessarily restrictive. In addition, the agency may choose to complete a rulemaking already begun as part of the agency- initiated GRAS review. Proposed \u00a7 170.35(a) includes a technical revision that amends current \u00a7170.35(a) to place it in the singular. For consistency with the language of the statute, proposed \u00a7 170.35(a) also has been revised to clarify that the Commissioner might affirm the GRAS status of a use of a substance, rather than the substance itself. In light of the increasing complexity of the food supply, FDA recognizes that members of the food industry may wish to engage in discussions with the agency concerning novel issues that accompany the technical element of some GRAS determinations. FDA believes that the elimination of the GRAS petition process will not constrain industry from consulting with the agency about such novel issues. Rather, FDA believes that the substitution of the proposed notification procedure for the current petition process will encourage industry to consult with FDA early in development of food substances to identify the critical aspects of the safety determination that would need general recognition to qualify for a GRAS exemption. FDA is also proposing to remove current \u00a7 170.35(c), which prescribes the procedure for the submission of a GRAS affirmation petition. Under proposed \u00a7170.35(a), FDA will no longer be bound to review such a petition. Therefore, if proposed \u00a7 170.35(a) becomes final, current \u00a7 170.35(c) will become obsolete. VI. Proposed Establishment of a Notification Procedure A. General Requirements Proposed \u00a7 170.36(a)(1) provides that any person may notify FDA of a claim18946 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules 3FDA considers that the current voluntary procedure whereby developers of new plant varieties modified through the use of rDNA techniques notify the agency about food derived from the plant is parallel to, and has some overlapping provisions with, the proposed GRAS notification procedure but is nonetheless distinct from this proposed procedure. For example, current notices to the agency concerning new plant varieties generally are broader in scope than the regulatory status of substances introduced into the new plant variety and usually include a safety and nutritional assessment of food derived from the new plant variety in addition to a basis for the notifier's determination that an FAP is not required for any of the substances introduced into that food.that a particular use of a substance is exempt from the statutory premarket approval requirements based on the notifier's determination that such use is GRAS. The agency encourages manufacturers and developers of food substances and of new processes for producing food substances to use this notification procedure to inform FDA if such manufacturers or developers conclude that there is general recognition that use of a substance is safe.3 Current agency regulations concerning the eligibility of a substance for a health claim (\u00a7 101.14(b)(3)(ii)) (21 CFR 101.14(b)(3)(ii)) require that a substance that is to be consumed as a component of conventional food at other than decreased dietary levels be a food, food ingredient, or a component of a food ingredient, whose use, at the levels necessary to justify a claim, be demonstrated by the proponent of the claim, to FDA's satisfaction, to be safe and lawful under the applicable food safety provisions of the act. In the final rule establishing \u00a7 101.14(b)(3)(ii) (58 FR 2478 at 2502, January 6, 1993), FDA explained that the preliminary requirement that a substance be safe and lawful was necessary in the health claim regulation because FDA's authorization of a health claim places the agency's imprimatur on the claim. FDA further stated that it would be a violation of the agency's responsibility under the act to authorize a health claim for a substance without the agency being satisfied that the particular use of the substance is safe. As discussed in detail in section VI.D of this document, an agency response to a GRAS notice would not be equivalent to an agency affirmation of GRAS status. Therefore, if adopted, the GRAS notification procedure proposed in this notice will not satisfy a health claim petitioner's responsibilities under \u00a7101.14(b)(3)(ii). In addition, FDA recently proposed that good manufacturing practice for infant formula requires that only substances whose use in infant formula is safe and suitable under the applicable food safety provisions of the act be usedto make this product; that is, that the substance be GRAS for such use, used in accordance with the agency's food additive regulations, or authorized for such use by a prior sanction (proposed \u00a7106.40(a); 61 FR 36154 at 36212, July 9, 1996). FDA also proposed that a ``new infant formula'' submission required under section 412 (c) and (d) of the act (21 U.S.C. 350a (c) and (d)) include the basis on which each ingredient meets the requirements of proposed \u00a7106.40(a), and that any claim that an ingredient is GRAS be supported by a citation to the agency's regulations or by an explanation as to why there is general recognition of the safety of the use of the ingredient in infant formula (proposed \u00a7 106.120(b)(6)(ii); 61 FR 36154 at 36217). Again, as discussed in detail in section VI.D of this document, an agency response to a GRAS notice would not be equivalent to an agency affirmation of GRAS status or place an agency imprimatur on the substance that is the subject of the notice. Therefore, if adopted, this proposed GRAS notification program will not substitute for the requirements proposed for new infant formula submissions. The fact that the proposed GRAS notification program will not satisfy the requirements of either \u00a7 101.14(b)(3)(ii) or proposed \u00a7 106.120(b)(6)(ii) is reflected in proposed \u00a7 170.36(a)(2). Under proposed \u00a7 170.36(a)(2)(i), any person who submits a health claim petition under \u00a7 101.14 must comply in full with \u00a7 101.14(b)(3)(ii), regardless of whether the agency has been notified under proposed \u00a7 170.36 about a relevant GRAS determination and regardless of the nature of the agency's response to that notice. Similarly, proposed \u00a7 170.36(a)(2)(ii) provides that any person who makes a new infant formula submission under \u00a7 106.120 must comply in full with \u00a7106.120(b)(6)(ii), regardless of whether the agency has been notified under proposed \u00a7 170.36 about a relevant GRAS determination and regardless of the nature of the agency's response to that notice. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(b) requires that notice of a GRAS exemption claim be submitted in triplicate and provides the address for such a submission. FDA plans to use one copy of the notice for the agency's administrative record. FDA anticipates that at least two agency scientists, with food safety expertise relating to identity, dietary exposure and health effects, will evaluate most notices. Thus, for efficient administration of the notification procedure, FDA is stipulating that three copies of a notice be submitted.FDA is aware that there is increasing interest in submitting an electronic copy of information prepared for regulatory purposes. FDA requests comment on whether it would be appropriate to require or recommend that the submission include an electronic copy in addition to the three paper copies required under proposed \u00a7 170.36(b). B. Specific Requirements Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c) provides details on information that must be included in a notice. FDA recognizes that a decision to submit a notice is voluntary. However, as discussed (see discussion of proposed \u00a7 170.36(e)), under the proposed notification procedure, FDA would respond to a notice within 90 days. In order for the agency to meet this timeframe, the information in the notice needs to be presented in an orderly and consistent fashion. Moreover, FDA believes that a prescribed format and a description of information that the agency considers important in supporting a GRAS determination would simplify the notifier's task of preparing the notice. 1. GRAS Exemption Claim A GRAS determination must comply with the provisions of \u00a7 170.30 and the person making such determination is responsible for ensuring such compliance, regardless of whether that person notifies the agency about the determination. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(1) requires that the notice include a claim (hereinafter referred to as the ``GRAS exemption claim''), dated and signed by the notifier, that a particular use of a substance is exempt from the premarket approval requirements of the act because the notifier has determined that such use is GRAS. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1) would distinguish the notification procedure, in which the notifier explicitly accepts responsibility for the GRAS determination, from the GRAS petition process, in which the notifier is requesting that the agency affirm the GRAS status of use of a substance. Proposed \u00a7 170.36 (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) identify specific information required in a GRAS exemption claim in a prescribed format. This requirement will simplify the notifier's task of preparing this section of a notice and will enable the agency to use this section of a notice to effectively and efficiently inform the public about received notices (see discussion of proposed \u00a7 170.36(f)(2)). FDA has requested comment on whether proposed \u00a7 170.36(b) should require or recommend that an electronic copy of the entire notice be submitted18947 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules in addition to three paper copies. In particular, receiving electronic copies of the GRAS exemption claim may make FDA's administration of the GRAS notification procedure more efficient, especially if the agency uses an electronic means to make those claims readily accessible to the public. Accordingly, FDA specifically requests comment on whether the regulation should include a recommendation or requirement that the notice include an electronic copy of the GRAS exemption claim required by proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(1). a. Notifier. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1)(i) requires that the GRAS exemption claim include the name and address of the notifier. This is necessary for full identification of the person who accepts responsibility for the claim. This is also necessary so that the agency can both acknowledge receipt of the notice (proposed \u00a7 170.36(d)) and inform the notifier of the agency's response to the notice (proposed \u00a7 170.36(e)). b. Name of notified substance. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1)(ii) requires that the GRAS exemption claim include the common or usual name of the notified substance. This is necessary to identify the notified substance as well as to identify whether there are any labeling issues that need to be addressed. The notifier may include in the GRAS exemption claim additional information, such as that described in proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(2), concerning the identity of the substance if such information is appropriate or necessary to fully and unambiguously describe it. The agency recognizes that notifiers may have questions concerning the common or usual name for a notified substance. FDA advises that in such circumstances, a notifier should consult with the Office of Food Labeling in FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). c. Conditions of use. Proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(1)(iii) requires that the GRAS exemption claim identify the applicable conditions of use of the notified substance, including the foods in which the substance is to be used, levels of use in such foods, and the purposes for which the substance is used, including, when appropriate, a description of the population expected to consume the substance (e.g., if the substance is intended for use in a limited population, such as ingredients used mainly in infant formula, medical foods, or in specially designed food products typically consumed as a sole source of the diet by persons who are unable to consume food in conventional form). Information describing the conditions of use is necessary to delineate theboundaries of the GRAS exemption claim consistent with section 201(s) of the act, which states that a GRAS substance must be generally recognized as safe ``under the conditions of its intended use.'' This information is also necessary to determine whether dietary exposure to the substance presents a basis for concern about the safety of its use. d. Basis for the GRAS determination. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1)(iv) requires that the GRAS exemption claim identify the basis for the GRAS determination as either scientific procedures or experience based on common use in food. The act differentiates between these two bases for GRAS determination and, under \u00a7 170.30, the requirements for a scientific procedures GRAS determination are different from the requirements for a common use GRAS determination. The basis for a GRAS determination is thus fundamental to the GRAS exemption claim. e. Availability of information. A GRAS determination must comply with the provisions of \u00a7 170.30 and the person making such determination is responsible for ensuring such compliance, regardless of whether that person notifies the agency about the determination. As discussed more fully below (see discussion of proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(4)), and in keeping with the agency's commitment to achieving the goals for Reinventing Food Regulations, FDA is proposing to require that a notifier supply a detailed summary of the information that is the basis for a GRAS determination rather than the information itself. Proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(1)(v) provides a mechanism for FDA to verify the information that supports a GRAS determination by requiring that the GRAS exemption claim include a statement that the data and information that are the basis for the determination are available for review and copying by FDA or will be sent to FDA upon request. Notifiers who voluntarily choose to notify FDA of a GRAS determination receive as a benefit a response that documents the agency's awareness of the determination. As a condition of that benefit, the notifier must consent to grant FDA access to the data and information that are the basis of the GRAS determination. There is no burden on the notifier for developing the data and information that are the basis for the GRAS determination because such data and information must already be generally available in order to satisfy the common knowledge element of a GRAS determination. Additionally, any person who determines that a substance is GRAS should have assembled andevaluated the evidence that forms the basis of such a determination, regardless of whether the person subsequently notifies the agency about the claim. Therefore, FDA believes that the burden to the notifier of the proposed rule is the minimal burden of maintaining the information. Such preservation of the data and information that are the basis for the GRAS determination also represents prudent practice for those who claim an exemption from a statutory requirement. The new procedure that FDA is proposing to establish will involve the submission of a detailed summary of the information that forms the basis for an exemption from a statutory requirement rather than the submission of the information itself. It therefore is prudent that FDA monitor compliance with the essence of the statutory requirement (i.e., that there is common knowledge among qualified experts that there is reasonable certainty that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use). Accordingly, FDA intends to conduct random audits of data and information maintained by the notifier. Moreover, because the proposed substitution of a notification procedure for the current petition process would allow FDA to direct its resources to priority questions about GRAS status, FDA might conduct an audit on a broad issue or class of products if the issue or use of a class of products raises important public health issues. 2. Identity and Specifications Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(2) requires that the notice include detailed information about the identity of the notified substance, including, as applicable, the chemical name, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry number, Enzyme Commission (EC) number, empirical formula, structural formula, quantitative composition, method of manufacture (excluding any trade secret information), characteristic properties, any potential human toxicants, and specifications for food-grade material. This detailed information, which would be in addition to the substance's common or usual name that would be included under proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(1)(ii), is necessary to describe accurately the notified substance using commonly accepted scientific nomenclature and practice. For some substances, such as calcium acetate (21 CFR 184.1185), the most relevant information concerning identity may be chemical information such as its CAS registry number and empirical formula. For other substances, such as whey (21 CFR 184.1979), a18948 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules chemical formula cannot be used for identification; instead, source and quantitative composition (e.g., percent of protein, fat, ash, lactose, and moisture) appropriately describe the substance. In many cases, the method of manufacture provides important identity information. For example, an enzyme preparation that is derived from an animal source and contains the enzyme chymosin as its principal enzyme component (\u00a7 184.1685(a)(1) (21 CFR 184.1685(a)(1))) is chemically different from an enzyme preparation that is derived from a microbial source and contains the enzyme chymosin as its principal enzyme component (\u00a7184.1685(a)(2)) because the components and contaminants derived from the source material are distinctly different. In some cases, the characteristic properties of a substance may be important when defining the conditions under which the substance may safely be used. For example, if an isolated or chemically processed fiber is intended for use as a replacement for part of the flour used in baked goods, information about its physicochemical properties, such as its ability to swell due to high water absorption or to bind physiologically important ions, may be important in establishing a safe level of the fiber in baked goods. The proposed requirement that information relating to identity include any potential human toxicants in the notified substance derives from the known presence of such toxicants in substances of natural biological origin. For example, it is well known that potatoes contain the naturally occurring toxicant, solanine. In the plant policy statement (57 FR 22984 at 22987), FDA discussed the importance of ensuring that new plant varieties do not contain significantly higher levels of toxicants than are present in other edible varieties of the same species. This consideration applies to all food products that derive from a source known to contain naturally occurring toxicants. Specifications are an important factor in establishing food-grade quality for any substance intended for use in food. Substances that do not meet the specifications may not be suitable for use in food. Specifications may be general or particular and may relate to identity, purity, or both. General specifications governing both identity and purity are common for GRAS substances. For example, the regulations for microbially-derived GRAS substances usually stipulate, as a general identity specification, that the source microorganism be a nontoxigenic, nonpathogenic strain.Similarly, the regulations for many GRAS substances stipulate, as a general purity specification, the maximum permissible level of a heavy metal toxicant such as lead. In addition, GRAS substances frequently require a particular identity specification to adequately define the substance whose safety is generally recognized. For example, in affirming that canola oil (i.e., low erucic acid rapeseed oil) is GRAS for use as an edible fat and oil, FDA only considered the GRAS status of oil that contains levels of a specific fatty acid (erucic acid) that are no more than 2 percent of the component fatty acids. Therefore, the identity specification for low erucic acid rapeseed oil (21 CFR 184.1555(c)(1)) stipulates that, chemically, the oil is a mixture of triglycerides, composed of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, with an erucic acid content of no more than 2 percent of the component fatty acids. In some cases, FDA expects that the specifications for a notified substance may be generally available in a standard reference such as the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC), which contains general and specific requirements for more than 900 substances used in food. In other cases, the specifications for the notified substance may be the same as, or similar to, specifications in the agency's GRAS regulations but not available in any other standard reference. For example, the specifications for an oil that is substantially similar to hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated menhaden oil, which FDA has affirmed as GRAS for use as an edible fat or oil, could be based on the specifications in 21 CFR 184.1472. 3. Self-limiting Levels of Use Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(3) requires that the notice include any self-limiting levels of use of the substance. If a substance is added to food above its technologically self-limiting level, the food becomes unpalatable, unappealing or otherwise unfit for consumption. Information on a technologically self- limiting level of use of a substance would be important in addressing concerns about the level of use of the substance as a food component. For example, it is generally known that the taste associated with many GRAS synthetic flavoring substances limits the levels at which the flavoring substances can be used to levels below those known to exhibit toxic properties. 4. Scientific Procedures GRAS Determination The technical element of a scientific procedures GRAS determinationrequires that information about the substance show that there is reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use. The nature of the information that the notifier relies on to establish the technical element of the GRAS standard may vary from substance to substance. Such information may include, but is not limited to, the identity, characteristic properties, and methods of manufacture of the notified substance, applicable toxicological studies, and information relating to dietary exposure. The common knowledge element requires both that the information relied on be generally available and that there be a basis to conclude that there is expert consensus about the safety of the substance for its intended use. A notice summary that fully describes the technical evidence of safety, but does not provide a basis to conclude that the technical evidence is generally available and accepted, would be incomplete. The common knowledge element applies to all of the evidence that is the basis for the safety determination. a. Technical evidence of safety. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(4)(i)(A) requires that the notice include a detailed summary of the basis for the notifier's determination that a particular use of the substance is GRAS through scientific procedures. This summary would include a comprehensive discussion of, and citations to, generally available and accepted scientific data, information, methods, or principles that the notifier relies on to establish safety. Proposed \u00a7 170.36 (c)(2) and (c)(3) of the notice would require that information relating to the identity, characteristic properties, and methods of manufacture of the notified substance be described in detail; therefore, the comprehensive discussion in the notice summary should focus on how that information is relevant to the GRAS determination. Under proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(4), the comprehensive discussion in the notice summary of any applicable toxicological studies should fully describe such studies, identify the conclusions drawn from such studies, and explain how these conclusions are relevant to the GRAS determination. FDA is not proposing to require that the notice include the raw data supporting the conclusions of applicable toxicological studies because the agency does not intend, in most cases, to conduct its own detailed evaluation of those data.18949 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules 4For example, ``Recommendations for Submission of Chemical and Technological Data for Direct Food Additive and GRAS Food Ingredient Petitions'' (1993); ``Estimating Exposure to Direct Food Additives and Chemical Contaminants in the Diet'' (1995); and ``Recommendations for Chemistry Data for Indirect Food Additive Petitions'' (1995).Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(4)(i)(A) specifies that the discussion in the notice summary include a consideration of the probable consumption of the substance and the cumulative effect of the substance in the diet, taking into account any chemically or pharmacologically related substances in such diet. This consideration of dietary exposure is mandated for food additives by section 409(c)(5) of the act; \u00a7170.30(b) further provides that a scientific procedures GRAS determination requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as would be required to approve a food additive. Thus, such information should be included in the notice summary. Several technical documents that discuss the practical details of estimating consumer exposure to a food substance are available from the agency.4 The notice summary may also include a comprehensive discussion of scientific data, information, and methods that, in the notifier's view, corroborate the GRAS determination. For example, for a substance whose safety is established based on its identity, method of manufacture, and characteristic properties, a notifier may describe a toxicological study and rely on these data as corroborative. However, as with studies that are relied on to support a GRAS determination, the comprehensive discussion should fully describe such studies, identify the conclusions drawn from such studies, and explain how these conclusions are relevant to the GRAS determination. b. General availability of information supporting safety. The inclusion of citations to published articles is customary scientific practice and is the simplest way to demonstrate the general availability of the information on which the notifier relies. Proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(4)(i)(A) does not require that a notifier submit copies of published information identified in the notice summary because, in most cases, the agency does not intend to conduct its own detailed evaluation of the data that the notifier relies on to support a determination that a use of a substance is GRAS. Rather, the agency intends to evaluate whether the notice summary establishes a basis to conclude that there is expert consensus regarding the safety of use of the substance.Under proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(4)(i)(A), notifiers should limit published information citations to those that the notifier discusses and relies on to support a GRAS determination or that are appropriately discussed and explained because they may appear to be inconsistent with a GRAS determination (see discussion of proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(4)(i)(B)). Accordingly, the notifier should not cite published information unless the cited information bears directly on the GRAS determination. For example, a bibliography describing an exhaustive literature search about a notified substance is of limited or no value in supporting the common knowledge element of a GRAS determination if the relevance of the cited literature is not readily apparent or fully discussed. Moreover, such a bibliography would not, absent a discussion of the relevance of the material cited to the GRAS determination in question, fulfill the technical element of a GRAS determination. c. Unfavorable information. Proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(4)(i)(B) requires that the notice summary of a scientific procedures GRAS determination include a comprehensive discussion of any reports of investigations or other information (e.g., adverse event reports and consumer complaints) that may appear to be inconsistent with the GRAS determination. FDA is proposing this requirement as a prelude to proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(4)(i)(C), which would require that the notice summary include a basis to conclude that there is expert consensus regarding the safety of use of the substance. In other words, in order to meet the act's general recognition standard, all information, both favorable and unfavorable, that bears on the safety of the substance for its intended use must be considered. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(4)(i)(B) is consistent with the provision in current \u00a7170.35(c)(1)(iv) and (c)(1)(v) (which are proposed for deletion) that a GRAS affirmation petition include adverse information or consumer complaints and be a representative and balanced submission that includes known information, both favorable and unfavorable. Proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(4)(i)(B) is also consistent with a similar provision (\u00a7 171.1(c) (21 CFR 171.1(c))) in the FAP regulations, which requires that the petition must not omit without explanation any reports of investigations that would bias an evaluation of the safety of the food additive. Thus, the requirement in proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(4)(i)(B) is appropriate because general recognition of safety based upon scientificprocedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive. d. Basis for concluding expert consensus. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(4)(i)(C) requires that the notice summary of a scientific procedures GRAS determination include the basis for concluding, in light of the data and information described in the notice, that there is a consensus among qualified experts that there is reasonable certainty that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use. Thus, the notice summary must consider the totality of the publicly available and corroborative evidence about the safety of the substance for its intended use, including both favorable and potentially unfavorable information. As discussed in section I.C of this document, the bases for concluding that there is the requisite expert consensus may be quite varied. For example, there could be a basis to conclude that the necessary expert consensus exists if data published in the primary scientific literature establish the safety of a substance for its intended use and such data raise no safety questions that experts would need to resolve. On the other hand, data published in the primary scientific literature may not provide a basis for expert consensus if those data raise unresolved safety questions. Alternatively, the opinions of a specially convened expert panel or of an authoritative body such as NAS may provide a basis for expert consensus. However, an ongoing scientific discussion or controversy about safety concerns raised by available data would make it difficult to provide a basis for expert consensus about the safety of a substance for its intended use. 5. Common Use GRAS Determination a. Technical evidence of safety. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(4)(ii)(A) requires that the notice summary of a common use GRAS determination include a comprehensive discussion of, and citations to, generally available data and information that the notifier relies on to establish safety, including evidence of a substantial history of consumption of the substance by a significant number of consumers. Under current \u00a7170.30(c)(1), in evaluating whether use of a substance is GRAS through experience based on common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, FDA relies on information documenting that the ``common use in food'' of a substance satisfies the definition in \u00a7 170.3(f) such that adverse health effects, if they occurred, could be noted. In other words, a substance is not eligible for the18950 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules 5For example, subsequent to the 1958 amendment, FDA required that food additive petitions be submitted for several substances, such as polysorbates (25 FR 1727, February 27, 1960), even though those substances had been used in food prior to January 1, 1958, because the pre-1958 consumption alone was not sufficient to establish safety (24 FR 11079, December 31, 1959).6An exception is the use of a food substance in a limited population such as infants, where such limited use may be part of a demonstration of the safety of the substance for use by the limited population (e.g., as an ingredient in an infant formula).GRAS exemption merely because it was used in food before January 1, 1958, if such use were not sufficiently widespread.5 The fact that GRAS status is determined through experience based on common use in food does not preclude, in addition to information documenting that a substance has a substantial history of consumption for food use by a significant number of consumers, a discussion of relevant data or information that bears on the safety of the substance under its intended conditions of use. Thus, the notice summary may also include a comprehensive discussion of scientific data or information that, in the notifier's view, corroborates the common use GRAS determination. With respect to toxicological studies that are viewed as corroborative, the comprehensive discussion should fully describe the studies, identify the conclusions drawn from such studies, and explain how these conclusions are relevant to the GRAS determination. As discussed in section I.A of this document, it is the use of a substance, rather than the substance itself, that is eligible for the GRAS exemption. In addition, section 201(s) of the act makes a clear distinction between qualifying for the GRAS exemption through scientific procedures and qualifying for the GRAS exemption through common use in food. Many substances that are GRAS for a specific use through a common use GRAS determination could become the subject of GRAS determinations for additional uses. It is important to note, however, that an evaluation of whether an additional use of a substance that is GRAS through experience based on common use in food is also GRAS requires a scientific procedures GRAS determination when the use in question was not common prior to January 1, 1958. b. General availability. As discussed for notifiers of a scientific procedures GRAS determination, notifiers of a common use GRAS determination should limit citations to published information to those that the notifier discusses and relies on to support a GRAS determination or that are appropriately discussed and explained because they appear to be inconsistent with the GRAS determination.c. Unfavorable information. Proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(3)(ii)(B) requires that the notice summary of a common use GRAS determination include a comprehensive discussion of any reports of investigations or other information that may appear to be inconsistent with the GRAS determination. The legislative history of the 1958 amendment demonstrates that Congress believed that there was no reason to conduct specific tests to establish the safety of substances commonly used in food because their history of common use established a presumption of such safety (Ref. 1). However, nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended that subsequent reports of adverse effects associated with the use of a substance in food be ignored in the safety evaluation. A notice summary of a common use GRAS determination should also address whether use was/is sufficiently widespread that any substance-related adverse effects would be observed and recorded. Where a substance has been used by a limited population,6for a limited period of time, or under circumstances that do not lend themselves to the observation and recording of adverse effects, the lack of reported adverse effects may not be meaningful. d. Basis for concluding expert consensus. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(4)(ii)(C) requires that the notice summary of a common use GRAS determination include the basis for concluding, in light of the data and information described in the notice, that there is a consensus among qualified experts and that there is reasonable certainty that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use. Thus, the notice summary must consider the totality of the publicly available and corroborative evidence about the safety of the substance for its intended use, including both favorable information and potentially unfavorable information. FDA has previously discussed the common knowledge element as it applies to a common use GRAS determination which reads as follows: For a substance to be GRAS on the basis of a history of common use in food, there must be a consensus among the community of qualified experts that the use of the substance is safe. For such a consensus to be possible, information about the use of the substance must be generally available. General availability is the result ofdocumentation of the information, usually by publication. (50 FR 27294 at 27295, July 2, 1985) In addition, under \u00a7 170.30(c)(2), when the common use in food occurred exclusively or primarily outside of the United States, a common use GRAS determination requires that such use be documented by published or other information and be corroborated by information from a second, independent, source that confirms the history and circumstances of use of the substance. Such information must be widely available in the country in which the use occurred and readily accessible to interested qualified experts in the United States. C. Agency Response 1. Acknowledgment of Receipt Proposed \u00a7 170.36(d) requires that, within 30 days of receipt of a notice, FDA acknowledge receipt of the notice by informing the notifier in writing of the date on which the notice was received. This acknowledgment would serve as a means to establish the date of receipt, which FDA is proposing to couple with certain aspects of the agency response (see discussion of proposed \u00a7 170.36 (d), (e), and (f) of this document). 2. 90-Day Response Letter Under the proposed notification procedure, FDA would not receive the detailed data and information that support a GRAS determination. Therefore, FDA would not be in a position to affirm a notifier's conclusion that a use of a substance is GRAS, and the rulemaking part of the GRAS affirmation process would not be necessary or appropriate. Rather, FDA would evaluate whether the notice provides a sufficient basis for the notifier's GRAS determination. For example, FDA may question the GRAS status of use of a substance if the information provided in a notice: (1) Does not adequately establish technical evidence of safety; (2) is not generally available; (3) does not convince the agency that there is the requisite expert consensus about the safety of the substance for its intended use; or (4) is so poorly presented that the basis for the GRAS determination is not clear. FDA also may be aware of information that is not included in the notice but raises important public health issues that lead the agency to question GRAS status of use of the substance. FDA believes that this narrow agency evaluation would not have a negative impact on public health because the agency is replacing a voluntary18951 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules administrative process that was developed to provide official recognition of a lawfully made GRAS determination with a different voluntary administrative procedure. From a legal and regulatory perspective, this substitution is neutral. This narrow evaluation would facilitate FDA's rapid response to the notifier. Accordingly, under proposed \u00a7170.36(e), FDA would respond to the notifier in writing within 90 days of receipt of the notice. In some circumstances, the agency's response would not question the GRAS determination. This response, however, would not be equivalent to an agency affirmation of GRAS status because FDA would neither receive nor review the detailed data and information that support the GRAS determination. In addition, consistent with proposed \u00a7170.36(a)(2), any response from FDA would not constitute compliance with \u00a7101.14(b)(3)(ii) or with the requirements that the agency has proposed (61 FR 36154) for new infant formula submissions. In other circumstances, the agency's response could include identification of a problem with the notice. However, whether FDA chooses to advise a notifier that the agency has identified a problem with the notice, where the notice raises no important public health issues, is a matter committed to the agency's discretion. FDA is proposing to respond in writing to a notifier in all circumstances for the following reasons. First, a written response would make clear that the agency's evaluation of a notice has come to closure. Second, as discussed more fully in section X of this document, FDA believes that a written response would facilitate international trade. Third, as discussed more fully in section VI.F of this document, FDA believes that a written response would be a useful element of any file that the agency makes publicly accessible or any inventory that the agency prepares of notices received under proposed \u00a7 170.36. However, under a notification procedure, an agency response is not imperative in those circumstances in which the agency chooses to raise no question about the GRAS status of the intended use of the substance. As discussed in sections I.A and II of this document, a manufacturer may market a substance that the manufacturer determines is GRAS without informing the agency or, if the agency were so informed, while the agency is reviewing that information. Thus, FDA's proposal to respond to a notifier in all circumstances does not alter a notifier'sprerogative under the statute to market a GRAS substance. Nonetheless, as an alternative approach, the notification program could be structured so that FDA responds to the notifier only when the agency questions the GRAS status of the intended use of the substance. FDA specifically requests comment on whether the agency should, in all cases, provide a notifier with a letter at the conclusion of the agency's evaluation of a notice. Such comments may result in a modification to proposed \u00a7 170.36(e). FDA has also considered whether the time for the agency's response should be longer than 90 days, and specifically requests comment on whether the proposed 90-day timeframe for an agency response should be lengthened, e.g., to 120 days or 150 days. FDA's proposal to respond within 90 days reflects both a commitment to operational efficiency and a belief that the agency's evaluation of whether a notice provides a sufficient basis for a GRAS determination could likely be accomplished in such a period. However, FDA's expectation that it could respond within 90 days is in part predicated on its estimate, which is discussed more fully in the agency's analysis of the information collection requirements of this document, that the agency would receive approximately 50 notices per year. Accordingly, although comments on the information collection requirements of this document are submitted directly to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, the agency also requests comment directly to FDA on the number of notices that manufacturers anticipate submitting on an annual basis. Such information may result in a modified timeframe for the agency's response. 3. Subsequent Agency Action FDA is continuously evaluating the safety of substances in the food supply. In some cases, FDA may consider whether an emerging body of scientific knowledge raises questions about the continued safe use of a food additive or of a substance whose use was listed as GRAS, affirmed as GRAS, or commonly considered to be GRAS by the food industry. Likewise, FDA may consider whether specific information brought to the agency's attention (e.g., through routine correspondence from interested parties or through a citizen petition) raises such safety questions. In most cases, the information that comes to FDA's attention does not demonstrate a health hazard, and the scientific issues are resolved upon consideration by the agency. Thus, the agency does not routinely publicize safety issues that it is considering, or reconsidering,concerning the safety of a substance or class of substances that is used in food unless action by the agency is necessary for public health protection. Similarly, FDA may direct resources to exploring issues raised by a GRAS notice even though such issues do not, on their face, appear to be significant public health issues. Alternatively, FDA may, at some point after its 90-day response to the notifier, receive additional information about a notified substance that raises questions about the safety of that substance. If, after issuing a 90-day response letter, questions develop for the agency regarding the GRAS status of a use of a substance, FDA may subsequently advise the notifier and other interested parties of those questions. In such circumstances, FDA ordinarily expects to advise a notifier by letter that the agency has subsequently identified a problem with the notice. As discussed more fully in section VI.F of this document, such a letter would be placed in a publicly accessible file so that other interested parties would become aware of the agency's position. Alternatively, FDA may, in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 170.35(b)(4) and 170.38, publish a notice in the Federal Register determining that use of a substance is not GRAS and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act. Importantly, however, when faced with a public health hazard, the existence of such rulemaking authority would not preclude other agency action, including seizure and injunction, to remove from the market a product that is an unapproved food additive. As discussed in section VI.A of this document, FDA has recently proposed that a ``new infant formula'' submission required under section 412 (c) and (d) of the act include the basis on which each ingredient is determined to be safe and suitable under the food safety provisions of the act (proposed \u00a7106.120(b)(6)(ii); 61 FR 36154 at 36217). The agency could receive a notice under proposed \u00a7 170.36 concerning a GRAS determination for a broad use of a substance in foods and subsequently receive a new infant formula submission that lists the substance as an ingredient in a new infant formula and asserts that the use of the substance in infant formula is GRAS. In such circumstances, FDA could choose to reexamine the notice previously received under proposed \u00a7170.36. If, following such reexamination, the agency questions whether use of the substance in infant formula is GRAS, the agency could so inform the person who submitted the GRAS notice under proposed \u00a7 170.36.18952 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules D. Appeals FDA recognizes that in some cases a notifier may disagree with the agency if the notifier receives a response advising that FDA has identified a problem with the notice. FDA has recently reviewed the vehicles, provided in part 10 (21 CFR part 10) of its regulations, that any person or firm may use to appeal an agency employee's decision (61 FR 9181 at 9184, March 7, 1996). Although an agency response to a notice under proposed \u00a7 170.36 does not constitute an agency decision on the GRAS status of a substance, FDA is advising that it will consider any of the existing appeals processes that are described below as an appropriate vehicle to engage the agency in cases where a notifier disagrees with a response received under proposed \u00a7 170.36. Under \u00a7 10.75, an interested person may request internal agency review of an agency decision made by anyone other than the Commissioner. Such review ordinarily would be by the employee's supervisor, but may move up the management ranks to the Center Director or to the Office of the Commissioner if the issue cannot be resolved, important policy matters are present, or it would be in the public interest. Sections 10.25 and 10.33 permit an interested person to petition the Commissioner to review any administrative action. The regulations also include less formal methods of appeal. For example, under \u00a7 10.65, an interested person may correspond or meet with FDA about any matter under FDA's jurisdiction. Finally, any person with concerns about an agency response to a notice received under proposed \u00a7170.36 may contact FDA's Office of the Chief Mediator and Ombudsman (the Ombudsman's Office). The Ombudsman's Office, which reports directly to the Commissioner, works on resolving issues and conflicts that arise in any FDA component. The Ombudsman's staff is available to discuss options, explain FDA's practices and procedures, and suggest approaches for resolution. When appropriate, the staff of the Ombudsman's Office may contact FDA's staff involved in the issue and mediate a dispute. E. Public Disclosure and Accessibility 1. Public Disclosure Proposed \u00a7 170.36(f)(1) provides that any GRAS exemption claim submitted under proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1) of this section be immediately available for public disclosure on the date the notice is received. As discussed in section VI.B.1 of this document, any person who makes a GRAS determination isresponsible for ensuring that the determination complies with the provisions of \u00a7 170.30, regardless of whether that person notifies the agency about the determination. Further, the common knowledge element of a GRAS determination signifies that neither the common or usual name of the substance, the intended use of the substance, nor the basis for the GRAS determination can be confidential. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(f)(1) further provides that all remaining data and information in a notice be available for public disclosure, in accordance with part 20 (21 CFR part 20), on the date the notice is received. The common knowledge element of a GRAS determination signifies that neither the detailed information about the identity of the substance nor the information needed to establish technical evidence of safety can be confidential. Therefore, FDA assumes that a notice will not contain any information that is protected from public disclosure. Moreover, because a GRAS substance may be marketed without prior approval, FDA assumes that, in most cases, submission of a notice will not reflect the notifier's plans about the timing of commercialization, which is arguably confidential commercial information (\u00a7 20.61(b)). A notifier who considers that certain information in a submission should not be available for public disclosure should identify as confidential the relevant portions of the submission for FDA consideration. FDA will review the identified information, determine whether that information is exempt from public disclosure under part 20, and release or protect the information in accordance with that determination. FDA advises that, in most cases, the agency is likely to determine that all information submitted to support a GRAS determination is available for public disclosure. 2. Public Accessibility The food industry's basic need to know whether a food substance is in compliance with applicable provisions of the act originally persuaded the agency to clarify the regulatory status of a multitude of food substances by publishing the GRAS list. Under this proposal, the current GRAS list (i.e., current part 182) and the regulations listing uses of a substance that FDA has affirmed as GRAS (i.e., current parts 184 and 186 (21 CFR parts 184 and 186)) would remain in the agency's codified regulations. In addition, FDA is retaining the process whereby the agency may, on its initiative, review the GRAS status of a substance and, ifappropriate, establish a regulation in part 184 or part 186 affirming such use as GRAS. However, if this proposal becomes final, the existing process whereby an interested person may petition FDA to affirm the GRAS status of use of a substance and list such affirmed uses in part 184 or part 186 would be eliminated. FDA believes that there would be considerable interest, from a broad segment of the public, including members of the regulated industry, other Federal, State, and local government agencies, international government agencies, and public interest groups, in notices received under proposed \u00a7 170.36. Such groups likely would want to know whether FDA is aware that a substance is being used in food on the basis of the GRAS exemption and whether FDA has advised the notifier that it has identified a problem with the notice. Therefore, FDA is proposing to establish a procedure whereby all members of the public could readily access such information. Moreover, such a procedure would be in keeping with the agency's goals in meeting the Reinventing Food Regulations. All GRAS petitions are currently on public display at the Dockets Management Branch (DMB) because the petition process includes informal rulemaking and DMB is the usual repository for information that is publicly available during informal rulemaking. However, FDA sees no need to place the entire GRAS notice on public display at DMB because, under the proposed notification procedure, the agency will no longer be engaged in rulemaking. Moreover, a process of maintaining a copy of all notices at DMB would require that an additional copy be submitted and that an administrative copy be maintained at two locations (i.e., CFSAN as well as DMB). Such a process would be administratively inefficient. Nonetheless, FDA has considered the best way to make the information from the proposed notification procedure readily accessible to the public. FDA has tentatively concluded that making both the GRAS exemption claim provided under proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1) and all letters issued by the agency relevant to each claim easily accessible to the public is the most direct and administratively efficient way of meeting the needs of the public. Accordingly, under proposed \u00a7170.36(f)(2), the following information would be readily accessible for public review and copying: (1) A copy of all GRAS exemption claims received under proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1); (2) a copy of all18953 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules letters issued by the agency under proposed \u00a7 170.36(e); and (3) a copy of any subsequent letter issued by the agency. FDA considered whether the agency should only make a GRAS exemption claim readily accessible if the agency has not advised a notifier that it has identified a problem with the notice. The agency decided to make all claims and responses readily accessible because such a system will properly underscore the notifier's acceptance of responsibility for the determination. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(f)(2) makes explicit to notifiers that their notice to the agency about a GRAS determination is a public claim. Initially, FDA intends to prepare a file containing the information specified by proposed \u00a7 170.36(f)(2) and to place that file on public display at DMB. FDA is planning this approach because DMB is a common repository for publicly available files. Alternatively, FDA could make the file accessible for inspection at the agency's Freedom of Information Office or, in keeping with the current procedures for public inspection of the information FDA considered and relied on to reach a decision on an FAP, at CFSAN. Although FDA has tentatively concluded that it would be best to provide for public accessibility at DMB because the public is already accustomed to obtaining information relating to GRAS substances at that location, the agency requests comment on this matter. FDA is not proposing to codify how or where the information prescribed by proposed \u00a7 170.36(f)(2) would be made accessible because any mechanism that appears in the agency's regulations will bind the agency to its provisions. In keeping with the agency's goals in meeting the Reinventing Food Regulations, FDA wishes to maintain flexibility to improve the process for public accessibility, particularly as the agency gains experience with electronic modes of information dissemination. FDA is aware that the public review of hard copy (i.e., paper) files in a public reading room may become obsolete as electronic technology for public dissemination of information advances. FDA requests comment on whether proposed \u00a7 170.36(f)(2) is an effective and efficient means to provide the public with ready access to information from the proposed notification procedure. F. Inventory Proposed \u00a7 170.36(f)(2) would not require that FDA maintain an inventory of the information retained in the publicly accessible file. Consequently,such an inventory would be a new record within the meaning of \u00a7 20.24 and FDA would not be required to prepare such an inventory in response to a FOIA request. However, FDA recognizes the utility and importance of an inventory of notices received under proposed \u00a7 170.36 and of the agency's response to those notices, particularly for persons without ready access to the agency's DMB. FDA also recognizes that many members of the public would prefer to access basic information relevant to GRAS notices in a streamlined format. FDA further recognizes that the agency itself can most efficiently carry out its own responsibilities (e.g., with respect to monitoring imports of food products) by having basic information relevant to GRAS notices available in such a format. Therefore, FDA intends to maintain an inventory of notices received, the agency's response, and any subsequent relevant agency correspondence. Such an inventory would be an administratively efficient mechanism of accounting for the information residing in the publicly accessible file. Such an inventory also would complement the current agency regulations tabulating substances that are listed (part 182) or affirmed (parts 184 and 186) as GRAS. FDA has tentatively concluded that any inventory of notices received should be an adjunct to proposed \u00a7170.36(f)(2), rather than the sole means of distributing the information available from the notification procedure, because the agency could place the GRAS exemption claims and the letters issued by the agency in the publicly accessible file faster than it could amend an inventory. However, FDA is not proposing to codify the inventory as an adjunct to proposed \u00a7 170.36(f)(2) because such an inventory would require continuous amendment and the administrative procedures required to amend a codified inventory would be too cumbersome to meet the needs of the public and the agency efficiently. FDA is also not proposing to mention the availability of the inventory in its codified regulations. In keeping with the agency's goals in meeting Reinventing Food Regulations, FDA believes that refraining from codifying any aspect of the inventory will provide the agency with maximum flexibility to improve the process by which the inventory is updated and maintained. Initially, FDA intends that such an inventory would be publicly accessible in any file maintained in accordance with proposed \u00a7 170.36(f)(2), e.g., at DMB. FDA could also make such an inventory available through prevailingpublicly accessible electronic modes, such as the agency's home page on the contemporary World Wide Web. FDA requests comment on making any inventory prepared by the agency available through such electronic modes. VII. Effect of the Proposed Notification Procedure on Existing GRAS Petitions Under the current GRAS affirmation process, the agency conducts a preliminary examination of the data and information submitted in the petition. If FDA finds that the submitted information conforms to the requirements established under \u00a7\u00a7170.30 and 170.35, FDA makes an administrative decision to file the petition and publishes a notice in the Federal Register to that effect. At this time, approximately 60 filed GRAS affirmation petitions are pending at FDA. These petitions were filed with the agency under an administrative process that the agency is proposing to remove. Therefore, if this proposal becomes final, the administrative process that FDA would use to bring these petitions to closure will no longer be operative. Moreover, FDA is proposing to eliminate the GRAS affirmation process in order to increase effectiveness and efficiency. The continued commitment of agency resources to complete the GRAS petition process for pending petitions would be contrary to one of the agency's goals in this rulemaking. FDA recognizes that persons who have a pending GRAS affirmation petition have invested time and resources in those petitions. Therefore, proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(1) stipulates that any GRAS affirmation petition filed under \u00a7 170.35 prior to the date that a final rule based on this proposal becomes effective, and still pending as of such effective date, will be presumptively converted to a GRAS notice under proposed \u00a7 170.36. This conversion will allow the agency to bring filed GRAS affirmation petitions to closure, albeit under a different process than the one to which they were submitted. However, the proposed notification procedure has certain requirements that have no specific counterpart in the petition process. In particular, under the notification procedure a notifier explicitly accepts full responsibility for the GRAS determination by signing a GRAS exemption claim (under proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(1)). In contrast, under the petition process a petitioner requests that FDA attest to a GRAS determination. Thus, FDA cannot assume that all persons who submitted18954 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules a GRAS petition would in fact be willing to accept full responsibility for the determination. Moreover, the GRAS exemption claim in proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1) would be a complete and separate section of a GRAS notice that could stand alone and would contain basic information in a consistent format. As discussed, under proposed \u00a7 170.36(f)(2) the agency would use the GRAS exemption claim to effectively and efficiently inform the public about received notices. Thus, logic compels that a GRAS exemption claim filed under proposed \u00a7 170.36(g) include all elements of the claim required under proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1), rather than only those elements that have no counterpart in the GRAS affirmation petition process. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(2) provides that any person who submitted a GRAS affirmation petition that is converted to a notice under the provisions of proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(1) may amend such converted petition to satisfy the requirements of proposed \u00a7170.36 by submitting to the agency a claim, dated and signed by the notifier (i.e., the former petitioner), that a particular use of a substance is exempt from the premarket approval requirements of the act because the notifier has determined that such use is GRAS. Proposed \u00a7 170.36 (g)(2)(i) through (g)(2)(vi) describe the format of the GRAS exemption claim that would amend a converted GRAS affirmation petition to satisfy the requirements of a notice under proposed \u00a7 170.36. This claim format is similar to that required under proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1) but has been modified in two particulars (i.e., proposed \u00a7 170.36 (g)(2)(ii) and (g)(2)(vi)) to take into account the fact that the data and information to support the GRAS determination have already been submitted to the agency in the applicable GRAS petition. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(2)(i) requires that the GRAS exemption claim include the name and address of the notifier. As with proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1)(i), this is necessary for full identification of the person who accepts responsibility for the claim. This also is necessary so that the agency can administer the amendment to the converted petition according to the provisions of proposed \u00a7170.36 (d) and (e) (see proposed \u00a7170.36(g)(3)(i)). Proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(2)(ii) requires that the GRAS exemption claim include the applicable GRAS affirmation petition number. The petition number is the simplest way to identify the converted petition that is being amended.Proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(2)(iii) requires that the GRAS exemption claim include the common or usual name of the substance that was the subject of the converted GRAS affirmation petition (i.e., the notified substance). As with proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1)(ii), this is necessary to identify the notified substance as well as to identify whether there are any labeling issues that need to be addressed. FDA is satisfied that detailed identity information, such as that described in proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(2), will be present in the referenced petition because, under current \u00a7 170.35(c)(1)(i), FDA requires that a GRAS petition contain such information as a prerequisite to filing the petition. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(2)(iv) requires that the GRAS exemption claim include the applicable conditions of use that are supported by data and information in the referenced GRAS petition, including the foods in which the notified substance is to be used, levels of use in such foods, and the purposes for which the notified substance is used, including, when appropriate, a description of the population expected to consume the substance. As with proposed \u00a7 170.36(c)(1)(iii), this information describing the conditions of use is necessary to delineate the boundaries of the GRAS exemption claim consistent with section 201(s) of the act, which states that a GRAS substance must be generally recognized as safe ``under the conditions of its intended use.'' Importantly, a petitioner who amends a converted GRAS affirmation petition to satisfy the requirements of a notice may do so only for the intended use that was the subject of the GRAS affirmation petition. Any additional use(s) would be the subject of a separate notice under proposed \u00a7 170.36(c). Proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(2)(v) requires that the GRAS exemption claim identify the basis for the GRAS determination as scientific procedures or experience based on common use in food. As discussed in section I.B.4 of this document, under \u00a7 170.30, the requirements for a scientific procedures GRAS determination are different from those for a common use GRAS determination. The basis for a GRAS determination is thus fundamental to the GRAS exemption claim. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(2)(vi) requires that the GRAS exemption claim include either a statement that the complete record that supports the GRAS determination has already been submitted to the agency in the relevant GRAS petition (proposed \u00a7170.36(g)(2)(vi)(A)) or a statement thatall data and information that are the basis for the GRAS determination are available for FDA review and copying or will be sent to FDA upon request (proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(2)(vi)(B)). Proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(2)(vi) takes into account the fact that, in many cases, a petitioner has already submitted the complete record that supports the GRAS determination. Alternatively, proposed \u00a7170.36(g)(2)(vi) provides to the person who submitted a GRAS petition the option of agreeing to provide upon request any additional information that supports the GRAS determination but was not included in the GRAS petition. As discussed with respect to proposed \u00a7170.36(c)(1)(v), FDA might conduct random audits of such data and information or conduct an audit on a broad issue or class of products if the issue or use of a class of products raises important public health issues. FDA requests comment on proposed \u00a7170.36(g) as a mechanism for administering pending GRAS affirmation petitions if the proposed notification procedure becomes final. Proposed \u00a7 170.36(g) would not preclude any person who had a filed GRAS petition prior to the effective date of a final GRAS notification rule from submitting a notice of a claim for exemption according to the provisions of proposed \u00a7 170.36(c) or from submitting an FAP under \u00a7 171.1 and requesting that FDA cross reference the information contained in the filed GRAS petition in accordance with \u00a7 171.1(b). VIII. Interim Policy Between the time of publication of this proposal and any final rule based on this proposal, FDA invites interested persons who determine that a use of a substance is GRAS to notify FDA of such GRAS determinations as described in proposed \u00a7 170.36 (b) and (c). In general, the agency would administer the notices as described in proposed \u00a7170.36 (d) through (f) (i.e., FDA would acknowledge receipt of the notice, respond in writing to the notifier, and make publicly accessible a copy of all GRAS exemption claims and the agency's response). However, although FDA would make a good faith effort to respond within the proposed 90-day timeframe, the agency would not be bound by such a timeframe. FDA will determine whether its experience in administering such notices suggests modifications to the proposed procedure. FDA realizes that some individuals who have a filed GRAS affirmation petition pending at the agency may be interested in converting such petition to a notice under proposed \u00a7 170.36(g) or18955 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules in submitting a complete notice for the petitioned use under proposed \u00a7 170.36 (b) and (c). FDA invites such petitioners to submit an amendment in accordance with proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(2) or to submit a complete notice for the petitioned use in accordance with proposed \u00a7 170.36 (b) and (c). FDA would administer such notice or amendment as described in proposed \u00a7170.36 (d) through (f). However, during the interim period FDA would not continue to commit resources to review of a GRAS affirmation petition if the agency receives an amendment in accordance with proposed \u00a7 170.36(g)(2) or receives a complete notice concerning the petitioned use. FDA will consult upon request with interested persons who seek additional guidance in preparing a notice because such consultation may identify sections of the proposed procedure that may require clarification in any final rule based on the proposal. IX. Conforming Amendments This proposal would eliminate the GRAS petition process set out in \u00a7170.35(c). Therefore, FDA is proposing conforming amendments to revise current \u00a7\u00a7 184.1(b)(1) and 186.1(b)(1) by removing the last sentence of each paragraph. These sentences provide that persons seeking FDA approval of an independent determination that a use of a food substance is GRAS may submit a petition in accordance with \u00a7 170.35. Consistent with the proposed elimination of the GRAS petition process set out in \u00a7 170.35(c), FDA is also proposing a conforming amendment to revise current \u00a7 170.38(a) to: (1) Remove the provision that the Commissioner may, in accordance with \u00a7170.35(c)(5), publish a notice in the Federal Register determining that a substance is not GRAS and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act and (2) retain the provision in \u00a7170.38(a) that the Commissioner may, in accordance with \u00a7 170.35(b)(4) (i.e., on his/her own initiative), publish such a notice in the Federal Register . Importantly, however, when faced with a public health hazard, the existence of such rulemaking authority would not preclude other agency action, including seizure and injunction, to remove from the market a product that is an unapproved food additive. X. International Harmonization FDA is committed to international harmonization of regulatory requirements and guidelines that preserve and enhance the agency's ability to accomplish its public health mission, enhance regulatoryeffectiveness by providing more consumer protection with scarce government resources, and increase worldwide access to safe and high quality food products (60 FR 53078, October 11, 1995). FDA is not aware of a provision in the laws of any other country that is equivalent to the GRAS exemption. On the other hand, the laws of other countries provide exemptions (e.g., for ``natural'' products) that have no equivalent under the act. Thus, the international community is already accustomed to operating in accordance with a variety of regulatory approaches for substances added to food. FDA's proposed substitution of a GRAS notification procedure for the current GRAS petition process would not impose any new requirements that would affect imported food products. Under the current petition process, FDA makes a public announcement that a petition has been filed and incorporates an affirmed use of a substance into a codified list. Under the proposed notification procedure, FDA would make readily accessible to the public, including international agencies and firms, the notice's ``GRAS exemption claim,'' which would include a succinct description of the notified substance, the applicable conditions of use, and the basis for the GRAS determination (i.e., through scientific procedures or through experience based on common use in food). FDA would also make readily accessible to the public the agency's response to the notice. Further, under the act, a variety of substances that must be declared on the food label are exempt from premarket approval on the basis of the GRAS exemption and are not included on any government list or inventory of substances that are used lawfully in the U.S. food supply. Operation of either the petition process or the proposed notification procedure does not change that fact. FDA recognizes that interested persons may want to know the official regulatory status of a food substance in the United States prior to using that substance in foods that will enter international commerce. FDA also recognizes that the proposed agency response to a GRAS notice may have less weight in the international community than the agency's affirmation of GRAS status. However, as a practical matter, FDA has announced only approximately 30 GRAS affirmations in the 10 years preceding this proposed rule. This small number of GRAS affirmations has a minimal impact on considerations of international trade.For these reasons, FDA does not anticipate that the proposed substitution of a GRAS notification procedure for the GRAS petition process will have any impact on international trade. Nevertheless, the agency invites comment on this matter from the international community and from firms who import food products into the United States or who export U.S. made food products. XI. Food Substances Used in Animal Feed FDA's regulations regarding the eligibility of substances used in animal food or feeds for classification as GRAS, and the procedures for affirmation of GRAS status for such substances, are codified at \u00a7\u00a7 570.30 and 570.35, respectively. The requirements described in these regulations are parallel to the requirements for GRAS substances that are used in human food, although some requirements of \u00a7 170.30 have no corresponding requirement in \u00a7570.30. As an example relevant to this rulemaking, the requirements of \u00a7570.30(c) are identical to the requirements of \u00a7 170.30(c)(1), but \u00a7570.30(c) has not been amended to describe the requirements for a common use GRAS determination based on history of use when that history of use occurred primarily or exclusively outside the United States. In addition, the agency's GRAS review did not extend to the use of food substances in animal food or feeds. Thus, \u00a7 570.30 does not contain provisions analogous to \u00a7170.30 (e) and (f). The general provisions in subpart A of part 184 were issued under the auspices of the agency's comprehensive review of GRAS substances. Because this agency review did not extend to the use of food substances in animal food or feeds, the agency did not issue a corresponding subpart A in part 584 (21 CFR part 584). Therefore, any proposed rule to modify \u00a7\u00a7570.30 and 570.35 would require no conforming amendments in part 584. FDA is also proposing to amend the provisions of \u00a7 570.30 that are parallel to the provisions of current \u00a7 170.30 (i.e., \u00a7 570.30 (a) and (b)) because \u00a7\u00a7170.30 and 570.30 implement the same statutory provisions. Therefore, it is important for the agency's standards concerning GRAS substances to be consistent with respect to substances used in human food and substances used in animal food or feeds. FDA is also proposing to eliminate the GRAS affirmation petition process provided for in \u00a7 570.35 (a) and (c) because the corresponding process for substances used in human food is being eliminated. Although the GRAS18956 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules affirmation process has rarely been employed for substances used in animal food or feeds, FDA believes that it is appropriate to provide the option of a GRAS notification procedure for animal food or feeds that would be parallel to proposed \u00a7 170.36. Therefore, in proposed \u00a7 570.36 the agency is proposing a GRAS notification procedure for substances used in animal food or feeds. Finally, FDA is proposing to revise current \u00a7 570.38(a) as a conforming amendment required by removing the current GRAS affirmation petition process for substances used in animal food or feeds. With regard to the notification procedure, FDA's proposal for substances that would be used in animal food or feeds is for practical purposes identical to FDA's proposal for substances that would be used in human food. As discussed in more detail throughout this document, FDA is specifically requesting comment on the following issues concerning the proposed regulations for substances that would be used in human food: (1) Whether it would be appropriate to require or recommend that the submission include an electronic copy, in addition to three paper copies, of some or all of the notice; (2) the proposed requirement that, in all cases, FDA respond to the notifier; (3) whether the agency should be permitted more than 90 days to respond to a GRAS notice; (4) the number of notices that notifiers anticipate submitting on an annual basis; (5) the agency's proposal to provide the public with ready access to information from the proposed notification procedure and the location for such information; (6) whether any inventory prepared by the agency should be available through electronic modes; (7) its proposal for administering pending GRAS affirmation petitions if the proposed notification procedure becomes final; and (8) whether the proposed substitution of a GRAS notification procedure for the GRAS petition process would have any impact on international trade. FDA specifically requests comments on these same issues for the proposed regulations concerning substances that would be used in animal foods or feed. In the case of substances that would be used in animal feed, FDA is particularly concerned about the practical implications of a 90-day response period, because, to date, the agency has received fewer than 10 GRAS affirmation petitions for substances that would be used solely in animal food or feed. Should the number of notices received under a GRAS notification program exceed more thana few notices per year, agency resources devoted to the animal feed program likely would be insufficient to evaluate, within the proposed 90-day timeframe, whether the notice provides a sufficient basis for a GRAS determination. Thus, comments to the proposal may justify that the agency adopt, in a final rule, a longer timeframe for notifications concerning substances used in animal feed. The agency recognizes that notifiers may have questions concerning the common or usual name for a substance that would be used in animal feeds. FDA advises that, in such circumstances, a notifier should consult with the Division of Animal Feeds in FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine. XII. Summary of the Proposal FDA is proposing to clarify current \u00a7170.30 regarding the eligibility of the use of a substance for exemption from the act's premarket approval requirements based on a GRAS determination. Specifically, FDA is proposing to amend current \u00a7 170.30(a) to clarify that general recognition of safety requires that there be common knowledge among the qualified expert community that there is reasonable certainty that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use. This amendment would also clarify that a GRAS substance is neither more safe nor less safe than an approved food additive, and that the distinction between a GRAS substance and an approved food additive is in the common knowledge of, and expert consensus about, that safety. In addition, FDA is proposing two changes to current \u00a7 170.30(b). First, FDA is proposing to clarify the types of technical evidence of safety that ordinarily would constitute common knowledge about a substance that is GRAS through scientific procedures. FDA is proposing this change because the quantity and quality of scientific evidence required to obtain approval of a substance as a food additive vary considerably depending upon the estimated dietary exposure to the substance and the chemical, physical, and physiological properties of the substance. Second, FDA is proposing to clarify the role of publication in satisfying the common knowledge element of the GRAS standard because publication is ordinarily required, but may not always be sufficient, to satisfy this element. For consistency with these proposed amendments, FDA is also proposing to amend the definition of ``scientific procedures'' in \u00a7 170.3(h). In keeping with the Reinventing Food Regulations, FDA is proposing toreplace the current voluntary GRAS affirmation process with a voluntary procedure whereby any person may notify FDA of a GRAS determination. The notice would include a ``GRAS exemption claim,'' dated and signed by the notifier, that would provide, in a consistent format, specific information about a GRAS determination. This claim would include a succinct description of the notified substance, the applicable conditions of use, and the basis for the GRAS determination. The GRAS exemption claim would also include a statement that the information supporting the GRAS determination was available for FDA review and copying or would be sent to FDA upon request. In addition to the GRAS exemption claim, the notice would include detailed information about the identity of the notified substance and a detailed discussion of the basis for the notifier's GRAS determination. FDA would evaluate whether the notice provides a sufficient basis for a GRAS determination and whether information in the notice or otherwise available to FDA raises issues that lead the agency to question whether use of the substance is GRAS. Within 90 days from the date of receipt of the notice, FDA would respond to the notifier in writing and could advise the notifier that the agency has identified a problem with the notice. A response that does not advise that the agency has identified a problem with the notice would not be equivalent to an affirmation of GRAS status by the agency. For each notice received, FDA would make readily accessible to the public the GRAS exemption claim and the agency's response. Although FDA would maintain a readily accessible inventory of notices received and the agency's response to them, this inventory would be neither codified nor referenced in the agency's regulations. Under the proposal, all GRAS affirmation petitions that were filed by FDA under \u00a7 170.35 prior to the effective date of a GRAS notification final rule and still pending as of that date would be presumptively converted to a notice on that date. Any person who had submitted a GRAS affirmation petition that is converted to a notice could: (1) Amend such converted petition to satisfy the requirements of the notification procedure by submitting to the agency a modified GRAS exemption claim; (2) submit an FAP for the substance and request that FDA cross reference the information in the GRAS affirmation petition; or (3) submit a complete notice in accordance with the notification procedure.18957 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules FDA's regulations in part 570 concerning GRAS substances for use in animal food or feeds implement the same statutory provisions as the regulations in part 170 concerning GRAS substances for use in human food. Accordingly, FDA is proposing: (1) To amend the provisions of \u00a7 570.30 that are parallel to the provisions of current \u00a7 170.30 ( i.e., \u00a7570.30(a) and (b)); (2) to eliminate the GRAS affirmation petition process provided for in \u00a7 570.35(a) and (c); and (3) to provide the option of a GRAS notification procedure for substances used in animal food or feeds that would be parallel to proposed \u00a7 170.36. FDA is also proposing several amendments to parts 170, 184, 186, and 570 of its regulations as conforming amendments. XIII. Paperwork Reduction This proposed rule contains information that is subject to review by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104\u00b113). Therefore, in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B) and 5 CFR part 1320, FDA is providing below the title, description, and respondent descriptions for the information collections contained inthis proposal, along with an estimate of the resulting annual information collection burden. Included in the estimate is the time needed to review instructions, to gather the required information, and to disclose the information. FDA invites comments on the following: (1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of automated collection techniques, where appropriate, or other forms of information technology. Title: Notice of a Claim for GRAS Exemption Based on a GRAS Determination Description: Section 409 of the act establishes a premarket approval requirement for ``food additives;''section 201(s) of that act provides an exemption from the definition of ``food additive'' and thus from the premarket approval requirement, for uses of substances that are GRAS by qualified experts. FDA is proposing a voluntary procedure whereby members of the food industry who determine that use of a substance satisfies the statutory exemption may notify FDA of that determination. The notice would include a detailed summary of the data and information that support the GRAS determination, and the notifier would maintain a record of such data and information. FDA would make the information describing the GRAS claim, and the agency's response to the notice, available in a publicly accessible file; the entire GRAS notice would be publicly available consistent with the FOIA and other Federal disclosure statutes. Description of Respondents: Manufacturers of Substances Used in Food and Feed FDA estimates the total annual burden for this information collection to be 9,900 hours.

FDA tentatively concludes that there are no anticipated capital costs or operating and maintenance costs associated with the proposed information collection requirements. However, the agency welcomes comments on any such anticipated costs. The agency has submitted copies of the proposed rule to OMB for review of the portions of the proposal that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1995. Interested persons are requested to send comments regarding information collection by May 19, 1997 to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB (address above). XIV. Analysis of Impacts FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601\u00b1612). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation isnecessary, to select the regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects; other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). Executive Order 12866 classifies a rule as significant if it meets any one of a number of specified conditions, including having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or adversely affecting in a material way a sector of the economy, competition, or jobs, or if it raises novel legal or policy issues. If a rule has a significant economic impact on a18958 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules substantial number of small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize the economic impact of that rule on small entities. FDA finds that this proposed rule is not a significant rule as defined by Executive Order 12866, and finds under the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Finally, FDA, in conjunction with the Administrator of OMB, finds that this proposed rule is not a major rule for the purpose of congressional review (Pub. L. 104\u00b1121). A. Regulatory Options FDA has the following primary options: (1) Take no action; (2) Adopt proposed GRAS notification procedure; (3) Adopt a GRAS notification procedure allowing FDA feedback on independent GRAS determinations of either a higher or lower level of authoritativeness than the proposed notification system; and (4) Eliminate agency participation in independent GRAS determinations. B. Costs and Benefits 1. Option One: Take No Action Neither costs nor benefits are associated with taking no action. This option is the baseline case in comparison with which the costs and benefits of the other options are determined. The existing GRAS petition process is a government service provided to industry by which firms may voluntarily submit information to FDA for agency review and affirmation of the GRAS status of the use of a substance in food. Although FDA does not charge a fee to review material submitted under the GRAS petition process, participation in that process is not without cost because the required information must either be generated or gathered, and submitted to FDA. The fact that some firms participate in this voluntary process implies that for some firms, the benefit of participation must be greater than the cost of participation, and also that the net benefit of participation must be greater than the net benefit of existing alternatives, such as private third-party review of independent GRAS determinations. However, the fact that the cost of participation does not reflect the costs involved in actually administering the GRAS petition process means that participation in that process cannot support inferences regarding the net social benefits of the petition process.The benefit firms receive from participation in the existing GRAS petition process appears to involve a reduction in the cost of marketing foods containing substances independently determined to be GRAS because FDA affirmation of GRAS status would likely facilitate marketing of such substances. Manufacturers of these foods and retail establishments buying these foods for subsequent resale to consumers may be reluctant to offer them for sale in the absence of assurance that FDA will not subsequently conclude that ingredients independently determined to be GRAS are unapproved food additives. If these substances were subsequently found not to be GRAS, any ensuing seizure of foods containing the unapproved food additive might damage the credibility of those manufacturers and retail establishments, and might lead to economic losses. If there were no process for agency GRAS affirmation, firms making independent GRAS determinations may attempt to substitute for GRAS affirmations by doing additional research, contracting with third party research organizations, or taking other steps to provide adequate assurances to other firms that FDA will probably not subsequently challenge their independent GRAS determinations. In addition to providing a desired good or service, the GRAS petition process may result in some benefit in terms of reducing the health risks from substances independently determined to be GRAS if FDA review of the information supporting independent GRAS determinations uncovers an erroneous determination which, if undetected, could lead to health risks. 2. Option Two: Adopt Proposed GRAS Notification Procedure The chief benefit of eliminating the existing GRAS petition process and replacing it with the proposed GRAS notification procedure is that the notification procedure will enable industry to obtain a limited degree of FDA feedback on independent GRAS determinations more quickly and at lower cost, to both industry and FDA, than the GRAS petition process. Under the proposed notification procedure, FDA will determine whether the notice provides a sufficient basis for a GRAS determination or whether information in the notice, or otherwise available to FDA, raises issues that lead the agency to question whether use of the substance is GRAS. The proposed notification procedure will come to closure more quickly and generate less uncertainty than the GRAS petition process because the notificationprocedure is based on a 90-day review period rather than on the open-ended review period of the GRAS petition process. In some cases, the GRAS petition process involves a number of iterative steps in which FDA asks for and receives additional supporting information. Under the notification procedure, FDA will base its response on the notifier's initial submission. In addition to the time advantage, the cost of participation in the proposed notification procedure will probably be less than the cost of participation in the GRAS petition process because the notification procedure will require the submission of only a summary of the information used to support the independent GRAS determination, rather than the full supporting information required under the GRAS petition process. For example, the notification procedure will not require the submission of references or material relating to methods of detection in foods, which are required under the GRAS petition process. Submissions under the notification procedure will probably be about 25 to 30 pages, while submissions under the current GRAS petition process can have hundreds or even thousands of pages. On the other hand, the same underlying information will be required under the notification procedure as under the GRAS petition process, so the potential cost savings will be confined to the relatively modest costs of assembling, copying, and mailing information. The more significant cost of generating or locating the requisite underlying information will not be affected. In addition, the summary required under the proposed notification procedure may fairly be viewed as a step beyond simply providing the supporting information as required under the GRAS petition process. Therefore, although participation in the proposed notification procedure will probably be somewhat less costly than participation in the GRAS petition process, the cost reduction is likely to be relatively modest. The primary cost of replacing the existing GRAS petition process with the proposed notification procedure is that it reduces the options available to industry for obtaining FDA feedback on independent GRAS determinations at a level of authoritativeness comparable to that currently offered under the GRAS petition process. Currently, feedback at this level of authoritativeness is available through both the GRAS petition process and the FAP process. The fact that FDA receives both GRAS petitions and FAP's suggests that some18959 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules firms find participation in the GRAS petition process less costly than participation in the FAP process. However, this difference in cost is probably relatively modest because the systems are quite similar. For example, substances that are GRAS may be marketed without prior agency approval and thus may be marketed during the period in which either a GRAS petition or an FAP on that substance is under review. The net benefit or cost of the proposed notification procedure will depend largely on whether the value of participation in the proposed notification procedure is or is not comparable to that of participation in the GRAS petition process. If the value of participation in the two systems is roughly comparable, then the time and cost advantages of the proposed notification procedure will probably lead to modest net benefits. However, if participation in the proposed notification procedure is significantly less valuable than participation in the GRAS petition process because of the lower level of authoritativeness of FDA feedback available through the notification procedure, then the proposed procedure could lead to net costs because firms may submit relatively more costly FAP's or take other steps to compensate for the lack of more authoritative FDA feedback on independent GRAS determinations. 3. Option Three: Adopt a GRAS Notification Procedure Allowing FDA Feedback on Independent GRAS Determinations of Either a Higher or Lower Level of Authoritativeness Than the Proposed Notification System The benefits and costs of replacing the existing GRAS petition process with notification procedures allowing FDA feedback on independent GRAS determinations at either higher or lower levels of authoritativeness than the proposed notification procedure are qualitatively similar to the benefits and costs of adopting the proposed notification procedure. The net benefits or costs of notification procedures allowing more or less authoritative FDA feedback depend largely on the cost of participation in those systems and the value of the feedback provided to participating firms under those systems. The value of FDA feedback to participating firms involves the degree to which that feedback facilitates the marketing of substances that have been subject to independent GRAS determinations. A system providing more authoritative feedback than the proposed GRAS notification procedurewould either require submission of more information or more detailed information, or would involve more detailed agency review of the same amount of information. Thus, participation in such a system would arguably provide more valuable feedback than participation in the proposed notification procedure but would also be more costly than participation in the proposed notification procedure. A system providing less authoritative feedback than the proposed GRAS notification procedure would either require submission of less information or less detailed information, or would involve less detailed agency review of the same amount of information. Thus, participation in such a system would arguably provide less valuable feedback than participation in the proposed notification procedure but would probably also be less costly than participation in the proposed notification procedure. In both cases, it is difficult to determine whether the resulting changes in the value of FDA feedback available through the notification procedure would compensate firms for the resulting changes in the cost of participation in such procedures, or to compare the net social benefits of offering such procedures with the net benefits of the existing GRAS petition process. 4. Option Four: Eliminate Agency Participation in Independent GRAS Determinations The costs and benefits of this option are qualitatively similar to those of adopting a notification procedure allowing FDA feedback of only a minimal level of authoritativeness. In general, the same results will occur if the value of participation in a notification procedure drops below the costs involved in participation, or if a notification procedure is not available. In both cases, industry will either submit relatively costly FAP's or take other steps to compensate for the lack of a GRAS notification procedure or petition process, or simply forgo government oversight of their independent GRAS determinations. If FDA no longer participates in independent GRAS determinations, FDA will not be aware of substances that have been the subject of independent GRAS determinations unless firms choose to submit FAP's for those substances. Any public health benefits associated with FDA awareness of these substances will be lost. However, if firms take other steps to confirm independent GRASdeterminations, then these other steps will be associated with countervailing public health benefits. Again, it is difficult to determine whether this option would result in net social costs or benefits because of the difficulty of estimating the value of various levels of FDA and non FDA feedback on independent GRAS determinations. However, the distinctive role of FDA in GRAS issues suggests that FDA feedback may be more valuable to industry than other, equally costly, activity designed to confirm independent GRAS determinations. Therefore, it is likely that the availability of some type of notification procedure will lead to greater net benefits than no notification procedure. C. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The proposed action will affect any firm that may have chosen to participate in the existing GRAS petition process or may choose to participate in the proposed GRAS notification process, including manufacturers of both human and animal food, food additives, and feed additives. The Dun's Market Identifiers database lists 27,989 firms in Standard Industry Code (SIC) 20, Food and Kindred Products. This includes dog and cat food, and prepared feeds not elsewhere classified. In addition, this database lists 113 firms in SIC 2869, Industrial Organic Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified, the SIC code that includes manufacturers of food additives. Therefore, a total of 28,102 firms will potentially be affected by this proposed rule. The Small Business Administration (SBA) guidelines on the definition of a small business for SIC 20 identify a small business as being a business having no more than 1,000, 750, or 500 employees, depending on the more precise four-digit SIC code associated with the firm in question. However, there is no easy way to distribute the total number of firms in SIC 20 into the appropriate four-digit SIC categories because more than one primary four- digit SIC code may be associated with any given firm. To avoid missing any small firms, the least restrictive size definition of 1,000 or fewer employees was used for all firms. The SBA definition of a small business in SIC 2869 is a business with 1,000 or fewer employees. Based on these definitions, and assuming that the distribution of employment for firms for which no employee data are available is the same as the distribution for firms for which data are available, a total of 27,531 firms could potentially be affected by this proposed rule.18960 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules Although this proposal may affect a substantial number of firms that manufacture food or food additives, many of which are small firms, this proposal will not have a significant impact on these firms for two reasons. First, this proposal replaces one voluntary program with another voluntary program. Therefore, small firms will not be required to undertake any additional activity or bear any additional costs. Second, participation in the proposed GRAS notification procedure should be somewhat less costly than participation in the GRAS petition process. Therefore, small firms should be better able to participate in the notification procedure than the petition process. D. Conclusions In accordance with Executive Order 12866, FDA has analyzed this proposed rule and finds that this proposed rule is neither economically significant nor a significant action, as defined by that order. FDA has also analyzed this proposed rule in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act and finds that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. Accordingly, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The net costs and benefits of replacing the GRAS petition process with the proposed GRAS notification procedure are indeterminate. However, any increase in net costs or benefits relative to the current system will probably be modest. FDA requests comments on the costs and benefits of replacing the GRAS petition process with the proposed GRAS notification procedure. XV. Environmental Impact The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. XVI.

ACTION: Announcement of financial assistance to be competitively awarded to public and non-profit private entities\u00d0including Head Start grantees, Parent and Child Centers and Comprehensive Child Development Programs\u00d0to provide child and family development services for low-income families with children under age three and pregnant women. SUMMARY: Section 645A of the Head Start Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 9801 et seq. , requires that, beginning in fiscal year 1995, the Secretary of Health and Human Services award grants competitively to agencies and organizations to implement programs which we call ``Early Head Start.'' These programs provide early, continuous, intensive, and comprehensive child development and family support services on a year-round basis to low- income families with children under age three and pregnant women. The purpose of the program is to enhance children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development; to support parents' efforts to fulfill their parental roles; and to help parents move toward self-sufficiency. Thus, the goals for Early Head Start are to: Promote the physical, cognitive, social and emotional growth of infants and toddlers and prepare them for future growth and development; Support parents\u00d0mothers, fathers, and guardians\u00d0in their role as the primary caregivers and educators of their children, and in meeting family goals and achieving self-sufficiency across a wide variety of domains; Strengthen community supports for families with young children; and Develop highly-trained, caring and adequately compensated program staff, because the quality of staff and their relationships with children and parents are critical to achieving all the other goals.

Program Purpose With the reauthorization of the Head Start Act in 1994, Congress established a new program for low-income families with infants and toddlers and pregnant women which is called Early Head Start. Beginning in fiscal year 1995, 68 grants were awarded and, in fiscal year 1996, an additional 75 grants were selected from among competing18967 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices agencies and organizations to implement Early Head Start programs which provide early, continuous, intensive, and comprehensive child development and family support services. In creating this program, the Congress acted upon evidence from research and practice which illustrates that early intervention through high quality programs enhances children's physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development; enables parents to be better caregivers and teachers to their children; and helps parents meet their own goals, including economic independence. Such programs answer an undeniable need. As pointed out in ``The Report of the Carnegie Task Force on Meeting The Needs of Young Children,'' many of the 12 million children under three and their families in the United States today face a ``quiet crisis.'' The numerous indicators of this crisis include: one in four infants and toddlers live in families with incomes below the poverty line; nine out of every thousand infants die before the age of one; and, more than five million children under three receive child care from other adults while their parents work, much of that care being of poor quality. The Early Head Start program provides resources to community programs to address such needs and to achieve the purposes set forth by Congress. The local programs funded through Early Head Start operate as a national laboratory to demonstrate the impact that can be gained when early, continuous, intensive and comprehensive services are provided to pregnant women and very young children and their families. Programs participating in this demonstration effort will: Ensure quality by meeting the requirements in the Head Start Program Performance Standards and other applicable regulations; Provide early, individualized child development and parent education services to low-income infants and toddlers and their families according to a plan developed jointly by the parents and staff; Provide these services through an appropriate mix of home visits, experiences at the Early Head Start center, and experiences in other settings such as family-or center-based child care; Provide early opportunities for infants and toddlers with and without disabilities to grow and develop together in nurturing and inclusive settings;Ensure that the Early Head Start program is supportive and nurturing of families; Respond to the needs of families, including the need for full-time child care for working families; Connect with other service providers at the local level to ensure that a comprehensive array of health, nutrition, and other services is provided to the program's pregnant women, very young children, and their families; Recruit, train, and supervise high quality staff to ensure the kind of warm and continuous relationships between caregivers and children that are crucial to learning and development for infants and toddlers; Ensure parent involvement in policy and decision making; and Coordinate with local Head Start and other child development programs in order to ensure continuity of services for these children and families. C. History and Background 1. Legislation In May 1994, the President signed into law the bipartisan Head Start Reauthorization Act of 1994. This reauthorization established within the Head Start Bureau a new program for low-income pregnant women and families with infants and toddlers. The reauthorization sets aside funds from the total Head Start budget for the subsequent four years at a rate of three percent in FY 1995; four percent in FY 1996 and 1997; and five percent in FY 1998. Consolidated into the new initiative were the Parent and Child Centers Program and the Comprehensive Child Development Program. This section of the legislation had a number of sources, including the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Head Start Quality and Expansion, as well as recent lessons from research and practice. 2. The Advisory Committee on Head Start Quality and Expansion In June 1993, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services formed an Advisory Committee to look at Head Start quality and expansion. The recommendations of that Committee centered around: Striving for excellence in staffing, management, oversight, facilities, and research; Expanding to better meet the needs of children and families; and Forging new partnerships with communities, schools, the private sector, and other national initiatives. Included in the report was a recommendation that the Departmentdevelop a new initiative for expanded Head Start supports to families with infants and toddlers, as well as convene a high-level committee charged with developing guidelines for this new effort. This recommendation was fueled by relevant research findings and recognition in the field that much more could be accomplished with earlier, more sustained support for very young children and their families. 3. Relevant Research Findings from more than three decades of research in child and family development illustrate that the time from conception to age three is critical for human development. The basic cognitive, social, and emotional foundation is established in these early years. The research also indicates that, to develop optimally, infants and toddlers must have healthy beginnings and the continuity of responsive and caring relationships. Together, these supports help promote optimal cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and language development. When these supports are missing, the immediate and future development of the child may be compromised. Recent research identifies the characteristics of effective programs that enhance both child and family development. This growing body of knowledge provides a foundation upon which the Early Head Start program is based. A more detailed discussion about the research in maternal and infant health, child-caregiver relationships, and the characteristics of successful programs can be found in the Statement of the Advisory Committee on Services for Families with Infants and Toddlers, which is included as Appendix C. In FY 1995 a contract was awarded to Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. to conduct a cross-site evaluation of Early Head Start. In FY 1996, 16 university partners of the initial 68 Early Head Start grantees were selected to conduct site-specific research. Thus, those 16 sites became the participants in the national cross-site evaluation conducted by Mathematica. Results are not yet available. Because the evaluation of Early Head Start is already underway, the FY 1997\u00b11998 Cohort of Early Head Start grantees will not participate in the cross-site evaluation. 4. Precursor Program Experiences In enacting Early Head Start, Congress was building on lessons learned through Federal, State, and community programs that serve some of our country's very young children and their families. Most notable among the early Federal efforts include the following:18968 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant has its roots in Title V of the Social Security Act, which was enacted in 1935. It is administered by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) of the Health Resources and Services Administration in HHS which provides leadership for building the infrastructure for health care services delivery to all mothers and children in the U.S., with particular responsibility for serving those low- income or isolated populations who would otherwise have limited access to care. The Parent and Child Centers Program (PCC) was established in 1967 to provide an array of services for pregnant women, infants/toddlers, parents, and families as a whole. Services include health, education, personal and interpersonal development, and family assistance. There are currently 58 PCCs across the country. Thirty-four others have been competitively selected and converted into Early Head Start programs. The Migrant Head Start program was established in 1969 to meet the needs of mobile farmworker children and their families. The program provides age-appropriate infant, toddler and preschool programming, full-day services (8 to 12 hours per day), and full week services (five to seven days per week) based on the needs of working families. These services are offered in center-based and family child care settings during peak agricultural seasons. There are currently 25 Migrant Head Start grantees and 42 delegate agencies operating in 39 States. Infants and toddlers comprise over 40 percent of the children served annually. The Child and Family Resource Program (CFRP) operated as a demonstration from 1973 to 1983. Ten CFRP programs linked community resources in efforts to enhance families' abilities to provide safe, stable, nurturing environments for their children. Part H of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was initiated in 1986 as an early intervention program for children birth to age three who have or are at risk for developmental disability. Part H supports comprehensive, statewide programs which identify and coordinate needed services within the context of a family- centered services delivery model. The Comprehensive Child Development Program (CCDP) was enacted in 1988 to provide and coordinate a wide range of services to children and families including child development, health care, education, economic self-sufficiency, mentalhealth, substance abuse treatment and prevention and other services to strengthen the home and family. There are currently 19 CCDPs in communities throughout the country. Eighteen others have been competitively selected to become Early Head Start programs. The Even Start Literacy Program, administered by the Department of Education, integrates early childhood education and adult education for parents into a unified program. The Healthy Start Initiative, administered by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau in HHS, started in 1991 as a demonstration program to combat infant mortality through community coalitions. In addition to these Federal efforts, many States and foundations are focusing on the special needs of very young children and their families. Carnegie and Ford are among the foundations addressing the needs of pregnant women and families with infants and toddlers. D. Consultation In the statute establishing the new program called Early Head Start, Congress called on the Secretary to develop program guidelines in consultation with experts in early childhood development, health, and family services; and take into consideration the knowledge and experience gained from other early childhood programs that serve large numbers of infants and toddlers including the Comprehensive Child Development Program, Head Start Parent and Child Centers and the Migrant Head Start program. As a result, the Secretary formed the Advisory Committee on Services for Families with Infants and Toddlers. The Committee was charged with advising the Department on the development of program approaches for the Early Head Start initiative. In September 1994, the Advisory Committee unanimously agreed to a statement that sets forth the vision, goals, principles, and program cornerstones for Early Head Start (the Statement, which includes the Advisory Committee membership list, is included as Appendix C). In addition, Federal staff conducted approximately 30 focus groups during the summer of 1994 to hear from parents, practitioners, researchers, advocates, and representatives of professional organizations. Federal staff also met with or received materials and recommendations from a number of other parents, practitioners, and researchers. The suggestions, guidance, and information received through this consultation process helped shape thedevelopment of the original fiscal year 1995 program announcement as well as this announcement. The results of this consultation contributed significantly to the recently revised Head Start Program Performance Standards (45 CFR Part 1304), which address services to infants, toddlers, and pregnant women as well as to preschool children and their families. E. Principles Recommended by the Field The Advisory Committee on Services for Families with Infants and Toddlers identified nine principles that are characteristic of successful programs for families with very young children. These principles are consistent with the themes that emerged from the broader consultation conducted by the Department. Therefore, applicants are expected to take into consideration these principles in designing their programs. 1. High Quality: Programs will ensure high quality in both the services provided to children and families directly, and the services provided through referrals. Programs will recognize that the conception-to-three age period is unique both in the rate of development and in the way young children's physical and mental growth reflects and absorbs experiences with caregivers and the surroundings. Because of this, the experiences and environments provided need to be of highest quality to promote child development. 2. Prevention and Promotion: Recognizing that windows of opportunity open and close quickly for very young children and their families, programs will seek out opportunities to promote the physical, social, emotional, cognitive and language development of young children and families before conception, prenatally, upon birth, and during the early years. Program staff will seek to prevent and detect problems at their earliest stages, rallying the services needed to help the child and family anticipate and overcome problems before they interfere with healthy development. 3. Positive Relationships and Continuity: Programs will support and enhance strong, caring, continuous relationships among the child, parents, family, and caregiving staff. Programs will support the mother-child, father- child bond by recognizing each parent as his or her child's first and primary source of love, nurturance and guidance. Programs will ensure that relationships between caregiving staff and young children support infant and toddler attachment to a limited number of skilled and caring individuals, thus18969 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices maintaining relationships with caregivers over time and avoiding the trauma of loss experienced with frequent turnover of key people in the child's life. 4. Parent Involvement: Programs will ensure the highest level of partnership with parents, both mothers and fathers. Programs will support parents as primary nurturers, educators, and advocates for their children; assure that each parent has opportunities for experiences that support his or her own growth and goals, including that of parenting; encourage independence and self-sufficiency for parents; and provide a policy-making and decision-making role in the program for parents. 5. Inclusion: Programs will develop services and create an environment which builds upon and responds to the unique strengths and needs of each child and family. Further, programs will support participation in community life by young children with disabilities and their families; and families of very young children with significant disabilities will be fully included in all program services. 6. Culture: Programs will demonstrate an understanding of, respect for, and responsiveness to the home culture of children and families as culture is the context for healthy identity development in the first years of life. 7. Comprehensiveness, Flexibility, Responsiveness, and Intensity: Programs will respond in flexible ways to the unique strengths, abilities, and needs of the children, families and communities they serve. Developmental opportunities provided to each infant and toddler will address the whole child and be continually adapted to keep pace with his or her developmental growth. Programs also need to be responsive to the distinct needs and experiences of parents whose children are disabled and those parents who have disabilities. 8. Transition: Programs will be responsible for ensuring the smooth transition of children and their families into Head Start or other preschool or child development programs which are of high quality and provide consistent and responsive caregiving. 9. Collaboration: Recognizing that no one program will be able to meet all of a child's and family's needs, programs will build strong connections to other service providers and to community sources of support for families. These efforts will foster a caring, comprehensive and integrated community-wide response to families with young children, maximize scarce financial resources, and avoid duplication of agency effort.These principles are explained in more detail in the Statement of the Advisory Committee on Services for Families with Infants and Toddlers, which is attached as Appendix C. F. Program Description In addition to the principles outlined above, a description of the Early Head Start program also emerged during consultation with the field. The Advisory Committee members conceptualized the program as having four cornerstones: child development; family development; community building; and staff development. 1. Child Development To develop fully, children need individualized support that honors the unique characteristics and pace of their physical, social, emotional, cognitive and language development. Critical to this development are the promotion of child health; positive relationships between the child and parents and other significant caregivers; opportunities for children's active involvement in appropriately stimulating environments; and enhancement of each parent's knowledge about the development of their child within healthy, safe environments. The services that programs must provide to support the child development cornerstone include: High quality early education services provided both in and out of the home in a range of developmentally appropriate settings for infants and toddlers; Home visits (especially for families with newborns and other infants, as needed); Parent education, including parent- child activities; Comprehensive health and mental health services for children; and Part-and full-day child care services, as needed by children and families. In addition, Early Head Start programs will be responsible for helping the family identify and access the services of a consistent health professional who can provide ongoing care for the family, child and pregnant woman. Further, Early Head Start programs will be responsible for coordinating with programs providing services in accordance with Part H of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act so that children and families served by these two programs can experience a seamless system of services. 2. Family Development Healthy child development depends on the ability of parents and families tosupport and nurture children while, at the same time, meeting other critical social and economic needs. Therefore, programs must work to help parents set and achieve goals for themselves and their children through individualized family development plans, which are collaboratively designed and updated by families and staff, and are responsive to the goals and ideals of the families. When families are served by additional programs which also require an individualized family development or service plan, such as a family employability plan or a plan under Part H of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, then a single coordinated plan should be developed so families experience a seamless system of services. The types of services that programs must provide directly or through referrals include: Ongoing support to parents through case management, peer support groups, or other approaches; Child development information and services; Health services, including services for women prior to, during, and after pregnancy; Mental health services; Services to improve health behavior such as smoking cessation and substance abuse treatment; Services to adults to support progress towards economic independence, such as adult education and basic literacy skills, job training, job placement services, assistance in obtaining income support, child support or related assistance, food, and decent, safe housing, and emergency cash or in- kind assistance; and Transportation to program services. Programs also must directly provide opportunities for parent involvement in the program so that parents can be involved as decision-makers, volunteers, and/or employees. Additional services not listed above, but identified by families through community assessments and mappings, may be provided either directly or through referral at local option. 3. Community Building Children develop within the context of the family and the family develops within the context of the community. Therefore, to support children's development, Early Head Start programs must establish collaborative relationships with other community providers to create an environment that shares responsibility for the healthy development of its children and their families.18970 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices The goal of these community relationships is three-fold: increasing access to high quality services for program families; assuring that the program's approach to serving pregnant women and families with infants and toddlers fits into the existing constellation of services in the community so that there is a coherent, integrated approach to supporting families with very young children; and encouraging systemic improvements in service delivery for all the families in a community. All programs will be required to conduct an in-depth assessment of existing community resources and needs and engage in an ongoing collaborative planning process with a range of stakeholders, including parents and residents of the community. If the community recently conducted such an assessment, the program would be able to use the results from that study and then proceed with the collaborative planning process. 4. Staff Development Programs are only as good as the individuals who staff them. Thus, staff development is a key element of Early Head Start programs. To ensure the recruitment and development of high quality staff, all programs will be required to: Select staff who, together, cover the spectrum of skills, knowledge and professional competencies necessary to provide high quality, comprehensive, inclusive, culturally appropriate, and family-centered services to young children and their families; Select staff who are capable of entering into one-to-one caregiving relationships with infants and toddlers, and caring, respectful and empowering relationships with families and other coworkers; Select program directors who possess the above characteristics and are highly skilled administrators who exemplify leadership qualities such as integrity, warmth, intuition and holistic thinking; Provide ongoing staff training, supervision and mentoring for both line staff and supervisors that reflects an interdisciplinary approach and an emphasis on relationship building and employs techniques and opportunities for practice, feedback and reflection; Provide training so that staff are ``cross-trained'' in the areas of child development, family development and community building in addition to the areas of home visiting, caregiving relationships, effective communication with parents, family literacy, healthy/ safe environments and caregivingpractices, early identification of unhealthy behaviors or health problems, service coordination, and the provision of services and support to diverse populations, including families and children with disabilities and developmental delays; and Recognize that high quality performance and development occur when they are linked to rewards such as salary, compensation, and career advancement. These cornerstones are explained in more detail in the Statement of the Advisory Committee on Services for Families with Infants and Toddlers, which is attached as Appendix C. Applicants are expected to take into consideration these four cornerstones, the Head Start Program Performance Standards and other applicable regulations when designing their programs. Part II. Program Information and Requirements A. Statutory Authority The Head Start Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 9801 et seq. B. Grant Competition The funds available for Early Head Start grants in fiscal years 1997\u00b11998 will be awarded through competitions in two categories: 1. Category One\u00d0New Awards to Unserved Areas Grants will be competitively awarded to eligible applicants to operate Early Head Start programs in geographic areas not currently served by Head Start Parent and Child Centers (PCC) and existing Early Head Start (EHS) programs. See Appendix D for a list of the geographic areas not open to competition under Category One. Applicants in Category One will compete on a national basis with all other organizations that apply to serve currently unserved areas. In awarding grants in this category, ACYF shall ensure an equitable geographic distribution of the grants. ACYF will consider the benefit to communities of funding new providers. 2. Category Two\u00d0New Awards to Communities Served by PCCs Grants will be competitively awarded to operate Early Head Start programs in geographic areas currently served by existing Head Start Parent and Child Centers (PCCs). See Appendix E for a list of the geographic areas. In awarding grants in this category, ACYF is interested in assuring that communities currently served by PCCs will have an opportunity to continue receivingservices to low-income families with infants and toddlers through Early Head Start programs after the authority for funding the PCCs expires in FY 1997. Applicants in each geographic area will compete for funds against other applicants wishing to serve the same geographic area. There are 58 such competitive areas (see Appendix E). C. Eligible Applicants Applicants eligible to apply to become an Early Head Start program are public agencies and private non-profit agencies. Eligible applicants include agencies that operate Comprehensive Child Development Programs (CCDPs). Before applications are reviewed, each application will be screened to determine whether the applicant organization is eligible as specified under this section. Applications from organizations which do not meet eligibility requirements will not be considered or reviewed in this competition and the applicant will be so informed. In addition, inadequate preparation or omission of essential components of the application or failure to comply with format specifications as described in Parts III and IV will result in applications being withdrawn from further consideration. On all applications developed jointly by more than one organization, the application must identify only one organization as the lead organization and official applicant. The lead organization must meet the criteria of an ``Eligible Applicant.'' The other participating agencies and organizations can be included as co-participants such as contractors or delegate agencies. Only organizations, not individuals, are eligible to apply under this announcement. D. Eligible Participants Persons who may participate in the Early Head Start program include pregnant women and families with children under age three who have incomes at or below the poverty line. Head Start regulations permit, however, up to 10 percent of children in local programs to be from families which do not meet these low-income criteria. Head Start regulations also require that a minimum of 10 percent of enrollment opportunities in each program be made available to children with disabilities. Such children are expected to be enrolled in the full range of services and activities in inclusive settings with their non-disabled peers and to receive individualized services as needed. The report from Congress discussing the creation of this program encouraged that participants in programs funded18971 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices through this initiative be identified while pregnant or while their children are infants. E. Target Populations Target populations are those that are specified in Part II, Section D. Within these categories, applicants may choose to focus on special populations, such as teen parents, or to design a program linked to welfare reform initiatives if they wish. F. Project Period, Funding and Project Sizes We estimate that a total of approximately $25,800,000 in ACYF funds will be available for funding new Early Head Start programs in fiscal year l997. A considerable amount of additional funds may be available in FY 1998 because the Head Start Act increases funding for Early Head Start projects from four percent of total Head Start funding in FY 1997 to five percent in FY 1998. If the Administration's FY 1998 budget requests were appropriated, a total of approximately $89,000,000 in funds for Early Head Start would be available. As previously noted, the selecting official may decide to select some or all of the awardees of FY 1998 funds from among the applicants to this announcement. The amount that will be awarded will be dependent on the amount of funds available and the nature and quality of applications received. Applicants are encouraged to apply for projects that will serve between 32 and 120 infants, toddlers and pregnant women. It is felt that projects serving fewer than 32 children and pregnant women would have difficulty providing high quality services while being cost effective. The recommended upper limit is intended to ensure that projects are of a manageable size and will also allow funds to be distributed among more communities. Applicants may propose projects outside of these recommended sizes, but must justify doing so. Examples of such justifications might be a project to serve an isolated or sparsely populated community with a small number of eligible families. Conversely, a project from a high population area that can demonstrate that it has the capacity to serve a larger number of children and pregnant women would be considered. There are no pre-determined cost per child amounts for which applicants must apply. It is expected that there may be considerable variation in amounts applicants receive depending on a number of factors, including the way in which the program is structured,the size of the program, the costs of operating in different communities and the amount of support that is provided from non-federal sources or through partnerships with other community agencies and funding sources, such as child care providers. Each applicant is encouraged to request an amount of funds that would allow it to carry out an effective, high quality program that is cost-effective and meets the needs of its community. Awards, on a competitive basis, will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods will be for five- years. Applications for continuation grants funded under these awards beyond the first one-year budget period, but within the five-year project period, will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the Government. Continuation funds will be available to serve eligible infants, toddlers and pregnant women who were initially enrolled and those eligible children and pregnant women who replace starting infants, toddlers and pregnant women who left the program during any single year. Allowable costs for developing and administering an Early Head Start program may not exceed 15 percent of the total approved costs of the program. Costs classified as development and administrative costs are those costs related to the overall management of the program. Additional information pertaining to limitations of costs on development and administration of Early Head Start programs can be found in Head Start regulation 45 CFR 1301.32, Limitations on Costs of Development and Administration of a Head Start Program, which is available in the application kit. All programs will be reviewed at the end of the first year of operation to determine their suitability for receiving continued funding. Programs will be expected to submit an ongoing operational plan and revised budget. Federal staff also may ask for additional material as part of the review. Given the importance of planning, selecting high quality staff and setting in place training mechanisms, and coordinating with other programs within the community, we expect that programs will spend some portion of their first year focusing on start-up activities. Programs are required to begin serving children, families and pregnant women within the first year. Programs must be fully operational no later than one yearfrom the date of their grant award. Because the first year is unlikely to include 12 months of full operation, it is assumed that first year budgets will be lower than budgets for future years. Applicants are expected to submit a first year budget which will include a start- up budget and a prorated operational budget as well as an on-going annualized budget. G. Required Match Grantees that operate Early Head Start programs must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved costs of the project. The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non- Federal share may be met by cash or in- kind contributions, fairly evaluated, including facilities, equipment or volunteer services. Therefore, a project requesting $100,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of $125,000 per budget period), must include a match of at least $25,000 (20 percent of the total project costs). Applicants are encouraged to provide more than the minimum 20 percent non-Federal share. In certain instances, the requirement for a 20 percent non-federal match may be waived in part or in whole, if the circumstances described in Section 640(b) of the Head Start Act exist. H. Applicable Head Start Standards Agencies that receive funding under this announcement must adhere to the standards set forth in certain regulations that govern Head Start programs in addition to Department of Health and Human Services' regulations that govern discretionary grants generally. The relevant Head Start regulations are: Head Start Grants Administration, 45 CFR Part 1301; Program Performance Standards for Operation of Head Start Programs by Grantee and Delegate Agencies, 45 CFR Part 1304; and Eligibility, Recruitment, Selection, Enrollment and Attendance in Head Start, 45 CFR Part 1305; and Head Start Program Performance Standards on Services for Children with Disabilities, 45 CFR Part 1308. On November 5, 1996, the final version of the revised Head Start Program Performance Standards (45 CFR Part 1304) was published in the Federal Register [61 FR 57186]. In addition to revising the standards for Head Start services to preschool children and their families, these regulations provide, for the first time, performance standards for Early Head Start programs serving pregnant women and families with infants and toddlers. The effective date for these regulations is January 1, 1998. At that time, all Head18972 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices Start and Early Head Start programs will be expected to comply with the revised Performance Standards. Applications for Early Head Start grants must provide evidence of the applicant's knowledge of and capacity to meet the relevant Head Start regulations, including the requirements of the revised Performance Standards. The Head Start Program Performance Standards prescribe the program requirements that grantees must meet as they administer Early Head Start programs. The four cornerstones and nine principles identify the factors that must be considered in designing an Early Head Start program. The cornerstones and principles are embedded in the Head Start Program Performance Standards which are critical in the implementation of an Early Head Start program. I. Early Head Start as a Learning Community 1. Overview On both the local and national level, Early Head Start is envisioned as a learning community for how quality services should be delivered to low- income pregnant women and families with infants and toddlers. Thus, continuous improvement, evaluation, research and dissemination activities play a critical role in this initiative. These activities include, but are not limited to: Continuous review and measurement of program processes to determine progress toward stated objectives and for the purpose of program improvement; Studies of program processes including services offered to and received by families and descriptions of how the services are delivered; Qualitative studies of individual families and programs; Studies of child, family, program and community variables that contribute to program outcomes; Studies of program quality and the relationship of quality to program outcomes; Studies of program variations and their relationship to impacts; National impact studies, conducted by a national contractor; Establishment of longitudinal research in a sample of Early Head Start national impact study sites; and Documentation of the program models and development of materials for dissemination purposes. 2. Requirement on the Use of an Automated Information System All Early Head Start programs will be required to use an automatedinformation system to collect program information on infants, toddlers and pregnant women, services, collaborative arrangements, staff, training, services utilization and costs. The Head Start Family Information System (HSFIS) is currently being modified to accommodate the needs of Early Head Start. The HSFIS software and User's Manual will be made available to Early Head Start grantees at the time of grant award. Grantees will be responsible for coordinating the collection of data for and management of HSFIS. 3. Continuous Improvement Requirements In order to enter fully into the learning community environment on both the national and local level, all Early Head Start programs will be required to: Conduct a local assessment of progress toward stated objectives and program improvement using the automated information system and other sources of data which measure progress toward stated objectives and contribute to a process of continuous improvement within the program and sponsoring agency; and Provide information from the Early Head Start automated information system as approved by OMB. Part III. Application Requirements Applicants must address the following requirements in their applications for financial assistance. For the convenience of applicants, these requirements have been organized according to the evaluation criteria presented in Part IV. A. Objectives and Need for Assistance 1. State the objectives for the program and indicate how these objectives relate to the Head Start Program Performance Standards (see Section II. H of this Announcement) and demonstrate that there is a need for the program that relates to these standards and is based on an assessment of need in the community. Describe the method used to undertake the community assessment and consumer consultation process that led the applicant to conclude that there is a need for the proposed program. An applicant need not conduct an independent assessment of the community if such an assessment already exists. In this case, the applicant should describe the method used in the recently conducted assessment and explain any additional consultation with consumers as it relates to the development of the proposed program. Provide letters of support for yourprogram from community leaders and residents. 2. Identify the population to be served by the project and explain why this population is most in need of the program. Identify the target enrollment size (the estimated number of infants, toddlers and pregnant women) and provide assurances that the population the program intends to recruit and enroll will meet Early Head Start eligibility criteria. 3. Identify the geographic location to be served by the program. Describe the key characteristics of the targeted area and explain what makes the area an identifiable community or neighborhood. Describe what services and resources are/are not currently available in the area to serve pregnant women, infants and toddlers. Provide demographic and other information on the target area which demonstrates that there are a sufficient number of eligible, unserved infants, toddlers and pregnant women in the area to justify the target enrollment size. For Category One funds only, demonstrate that the geographic area is currently unserved by an Early Head Start program or a Head Start Parent and Child Center. For Category Two, demonstrate that the geographic area is in the same area as that served by the current Parent and Child Center or explain why the boundaries of the service area are proposed to be changed (e.g. as a result of the needs assessment). B. Results or Benefits 1. Identify the specific results or benefits that could be expected for children, families and pregnant women participating in the program. Identify the specific community-wide results or benefits. Identify the specific results or benefits that could be expected for the staff working in a collaborative partnership with other child development caregivers and family development staff working in a variety of relevant community agencies. 2. Identify the kinds of qualitative and quantitative data the program will collect to measure progress towards the stated results or benefits. State how you will determine the extent to which the program has achieved its stated objectives. 3. Provide assurances that the program will collect data on groups of individuals and geographic areas served, types of services provided, service utilization information, types and nature of needs identified and met, and such other information as may be required periodically by the ACF.18973 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices C. Approach In designing the approach, applicants are reminded that, as of January 1, 1998, all Early Head Start (EHS) programs must meet the requirements of the revised Head Start Program Performance Standards, 45 CFR Part 1304. Therefore, all elements of the EHS program should be consistent with these standards. 1. All applicants must describe the planning the program will conduct during the start-up period to prepare for implementation of the program and explain how consumers and other stakeholders in the community will be involved in the planning. 2. Explain the approach to be used to recruit and enroll the number and type of infants, toddlers and pregnant women from the target recruitment area, as discussed in Part III, Section A. Discuss any special efforts you will make to recruit and enroll low-income pregnant women and children under age one. 3. Describe how the program will ensure that at least 10 percent of enrollment opportunities will be made available to children with disabilities (as defined by the IDEA Part H Lead Agency for the State). Describe the policies and practices the program will have in place to assure that a child will not be denied enrollment or participation in the program on the basis of a disability or the severity of such a condition. Describe how the program will work with the Part H local lead agency or, if available, the local Interagency Coordinating Council, to recruit and enroll children with disabilities (and their families) who have been previously identified by the Part H agency, and to collaborate with the Part H agency to arrange and provide for special services needed by these children and their families. Describe how staff will coordinate their efforts with others to ensure children with disabilities and their families receive high quality services. 4. Describe the approach to providing child development services and explain the rationale for choosing the approach. Identify and describe the specific approaches that will be used for assuring the intellectual, social, emotional and physical development of the infants and toddlers served. Describe the philosophy, curricula, staffing patterns, staff qualifications, types and quality of settings and any other relevant information that will comprise the program's model for supporting the growth and development of very young children. Clearly explain how your model will meet the developmental needs of very youngchildren (including children from non- English speaking families). 5. Explain how the program's child development approach will promote parent/guardian-child interaction and support the mother-child and/or father- child bond. Also explain how caregiving will be provided in ways that support infant and toddler attachment to a limited number of skilled and caring individuals. 6. Describe how high quality infant and toddler full-and part-day child care will be provided to children of parents who are working or in training or to children who require out-of-home care due to special parental circumstances such as substance abuse treatment. Discuss the relationship between these resources and the program's overall child development approach. Describe the process the program will use to determine that child care (provided either directly or through referral) will be of high quality. Include the location and description of the proposed child care facilities and describe any improvements and the costs associated with them which may be required to comply with the Head Start Performance Standards. Indicate if the facility is immediately available or indicate the estimated date for occupancy.

Describe the efforts the program will make to help assure continuation of developmentally-appropriate services for children, once the children reach the age of three. 8. Describe the specific approaches for providing, either directly or through referrals, ongoing well-baby and well- child health services such as early and periodic screenings, diagnosis, treatment, immunizations, nutritional assessments, developmental surveillance and anticipatory guidance. In addition, describe the approach for ensuring that children are cared for in safe and hygienic environments. 9. Describe the approach for supporting family growth and development and explain the rationale for choosing the approach. Explain the framework of and procedures for developing each family's individualized plan. Explain how you intend to work with other service delivery systems which require a similar plan, such as the Part H Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP), to ensure that the family only needs to complete one plan and that one plan can be used by all relevant programs to ensure a seamless service delivery system for the child and family. Describe how your familydevelopment approach will assist families and individual family members in identifying, pursuing and achieving goals and overcoming obstacles on the way to achieving those goals. 10. Describe how the program will develop relationships with parents which promote their involvement with the program. Describe the strategy and the opportunities for parent involvement, providing assurances that it meets or exceeds the parent involvement standards described in 45 CFR Part 1304, the Head Start Program Performance Standards. Explain what special efforts the program will make to reach out to and to involve fathers. 11. Describe what services the program will provide, either directly or through referrals, to promote adult and family health and wellness. Identify and explain the mental and physical health services which will be made available and accessible to the families of the infants and toddlers served by the program. Describe what the program will do to promote women's health and wellness prior to, during and after pregnancy. In addition, describe what the program will do to facilitate access to substance abuse prevention and treatment services and smoking cessation programs for affected families. 12. Describe what services the program will provide, either directly or through referrals, to promote progress toward economic self-sufficiency for parents. Describe the program's approach to basic literacy training, adult basic eduction, employability skills training, job development and placement services and any other employment and training services that are planned. 13.

Identify the existing transportation resources available to families in reaching services provided at the program site and in off-site locations. Describe any transportation arrangements the program will make to ensure that children and pregnant women are able to access needed services. 15. Describe the program's approach to community building and explain the rationale for choosing the approach. Describe how the program will be coordinated with other programs and services in the community which serve pregnant women, infants, toddlers and their families and how the program will assist in the development of local community capability, expertise and commitment to carry out comprehensive18974 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices service programs built around the needs of low-income pregnant women and families with very young children. Describe any barriers to collaboration in your community and explain the program's strategy for addressing these. Identify by name specific providers, agencies and organizations with which the applicant will coordinate in order to carry out the requirements of this project. Applicants should furnish formal interagency agreements or contracts (if available) indicating which services will be provided to which program participants and for what periods of time, by each of those provider agencies and/or organizations. 16. Describe linkages with community resources that the program will establish and maintain during the planning, implementation and operation of the program: health and nutrition (e.g., public health departments and other health providers and programs including Title V, Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and Medicaid prenatal care services and the Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment program (EPSDT)); early intervention (e.g., Part H local lead agency or, if available, local interagency coordinating councils and University Affiliated Programs); mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment; the agency administering Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); education (e.g., local preschool, child care, Head Start, and elementary schools); other Early Head Start programs; child care resource and referral agencies and their networks; business (e.g., the local Private Industry Council); parent groups; and other strength-building organizations. 17. Describe the approach to staff selection and explain the rationale for choosing the approach. Describe what staffing patterns and mix of staff qualifications and language/cultural competencies the program will require to ensure that staff, together, cover the spectrum of skills, knowledge and professional competencies necessary to provide quality, comprehensive, inclusive and family-centered services to pregnant women and young children and families. Describe the process the applicant will use to identify and select individual staff\u00d0from directors to caregivers to data management staff\u00d0 who demonstrate the personal characteristics, competencies and skills necessary to provide quality services and promote quality relationships with and among children, families, the community and other staff. Explain how the program will ensure that all infant/ toddler caregivers are qualified, withsufficient grounding in infant/toddler development and care and parent/ caregiver relations prior to working with children and families enrolled in the program. Please note the revised Head Start Program Performance Standards require that Early Head Start staff working as teachers with infants and toddlers must obtain a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential for infant and toddler caregivers or an equivalent credential that addresses comparable competencies within one year of the effective date of the final rule (January 1, 1998) or, thereafter, within one year, as a teacher of infants and toddlers (45 CFR Part 1304.52(f)). 18. Describe the approach to staff development and the rationale for choosing the approach. Describe the training, technical assistance, and supervision that will be provided to ensure continued enhancement of staff skills and teamwork. Describe how training and technical assistance opportunities will be coordinated with other service providers in the community so that Early Head Start both provides and benefits from the knowledge, expertise, and training opportunities of other relevant community programs and service delivery systems. Describe how the program will ensure that staff are knowledgeable about the rights of children with disabilities and are capable of providing such infants and toddlers with high quality care in a supportive and developmentally appropriate environment. 19. Identify and explain the management and continuous improvement plan(s) for implementing the program. Include: an outline of the timeframes and milestones for all key activities that the program will engage in during the first year of operation, as well as a preliminary outline of timeframes and milestones for key activities in the remaining years of the project; a description of the procedures for assessing progress toward stated objectives, including how the collection of data on results and benefits will contribute to a process of continuous improvement within the program and the sponsoring agency; a description of how an automated information system will become an integral component in the management and continuous improvement of the program; a description of how confidentiality of user data will be maintained; a description of the applicant's capacity (e.g. administrative and support personnel, etc.) to support the program at the proposed target enrollment size; a description of the strategy forminimizing staff turnover; and a description of how the program will go about establishing a Policy Council (as described by 45 CFR Part 1304) and a Health Services Advisory Committee (as described by 45 CFR Part 1304). 20. Identify and describe the proposed site which will be used to serve children and families and include a description of the size and location of classroom, administrative, and food service space, if applicable. If incidental alteration and renovation costs are proposed, include a written estimate and the date by which the proposed facility will be licensed and available to provide child and family services. D. Collaboration Describe the collaborative relationships the applicant will develop in order to maximize resources in the community. Include letters of support and commitment from other partner agencies in the community. In the area of child care to meet the needs of low- income parents, describe collaborative approaches to funding and service delivery with other community-based child care agencies and providers or child care funding sources. In partnerships with child care agencies and providers, the child care programs gain the benefit of Early Head Start resources and experience in enhancing the quality of staffing and program services to levels consistent with Head Start Program Performance Standards. Include letters of commitment from child care and early childhood agencies who will assist the grantee in delivering services. E. Staff Background and Organizational Experience 1. Describe the applicant's experience in providing comprehensive child and family development services to infants and toddlers and their families as well as pregnant women. Describe the applicant's experience in collaborating with local, State and Federal partners. Describe the applicant's history and relationship with the target community. Include a complete discussion of relevant program, administrative and fiscal management experience. 2. If the applicant represents a consortium of partner agencies, explain the relevant background of each partner and its experience in planning and implementing programs to serve children and families. Each partner must provide a letter of commitment which authorizes the applicant to apply on behalf of the consortium. 3. Identify and provide a brief description of key staff who are proposed to work in the program and18975 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices indicate their educational training and experience working with similar programs. Provide resumes. Build on the answer to Part III, Section C, Number 17 by explaining how these particular staff comprise a multi- disciplinary team of experts. In addition, explain how the ethnic and racial composition and language proficiencies of these particular staff are reflective of the community where the program will be located. 4. Describe the expertise the organization will utilize in conducting continuous improvement activities. Describe the experience of and provide resumes for the individuals who will assist the program with continuous improvement activities. F. Budget Appropriateness 1. Provide two detailed, line-item budgets: one budget that separates all relevant start-up costs from a prorated amount of operating costs to be incurred in the first year of the project (e.g. one column for start-up costs and one column for prorated operating costs); and one budget that reflects ongoing annual operating costs. In the proposed budgets, applicants must set aside sufficient funds so that at least two staff can travel to Washington, D.C. for two annual meetings of four days each to be convened by ACYF. In addition, applicants must set aside sufficient funds so that at least one staff can travel to a mid-point in the U.S. for two trips per year of seven days each for intensive training. Each budget should include the required non-Federal share of the cost of the project (See Part II, Section G). 2. Describe how these budgets reflect high quality, ongoing services provided at a reasonable cost. Include discussions on the appropriateness of staff compensation levels and funds set aside to assure ongoing staff development and training; costs associated with special equipment and technological needs and the removal of architectural barriers for persons with disabilities; renovation costs associated with providing environments conducive to the high quality provision of child and family development services; and costs associated with family transportation and emergency resource needs, etc. Explain what efforts the applicant has made or will make to secure other community cash and in-kind resources, besides those shown in the budgets, and what additional resources will be used to support the provision of Early Head Start services to children and families. 3. In providing high quality infant and toddler child care, applicants should describe how a variety of existingcommunity resources will be utilized and maximized. Provide documentation of the additional resources that will be combined with Early Head Start funds to provide high quality child care which meets the Head Start Program Performance Standards. Explain and itemize these resources or services, whether or not these costs are included as part of the non-federal share. 4. Provide information on the facilities the applicant will use, including the estimated cost and scope of any changes that are needed and when such facilities are available. In most cases, it is expected that, given the finite project period for which Early Head Start grants will be funded, applicants will not propose to use Early Head Start grant funds to purchase, construct or undertake a major renovation of a facility. If an applicant, however, believes that such a purchase, construction or major renovation is in the best interests of the government, and can demonstrate this in its application, it may propose to purchase, construct or undertake a major renovation of an Early Head Start facility. Part IV. Evaluation Criteria In considering how applicants will carry out the responsibilities addressed under Part III of this announcement, competing applications for financial assistance will be reviewed and evaluated against the following six criteria. The point values following each criterion indicate the numerical weight each criterion will be accorded in the review process. A. Criterion 1.

Application Submission Applicants submitting proposals should use the following format guidelines: Proposals should be organized according to the evaluation18977 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices criteria located in Part IV of this Federal Register announcement. For each of the six specified criteria, applicants should provide information in response to the application requirements described in Part III of this announcement. These application requirements are cross- referenced by number in the last paragraph of each criterion. All persons who prepared sections of the proposal should be identified along with those sections, as well as identified according to their responsibilities with regard to the proposed program. One signed original and two complete copies of the grant application, including all attachments, are required. The program announcement number (ACYF\u00b1HS\u00b193600\u00b197\u00b103) must be clearly identified on the application. Each application must be limited to no more than 100 double-spaced pages of program narrative (not including the forms which make up the SF\u00b1424 and resumes) excluding the one-page project summary. If the narrative portion of the application is more than 100 double- spaced pages, the other pages will be removed from the application and not considered by the reviewers. The attachments/appendices to each application must be limited to no more than 100 pages, (in addition to the 100 pages permitted for the narrative portion of the application). If the attachments/ appendices to each application are more than 100 pages, the other pages will be removed from the application and not considered by the reviewers. Applicants must indicate on page one of their Application for Federal Assistance, SF 424, whether they are applying for funding under Category One or Category Two (see II B. 1 and 2).

For Category Two, the applicants must list the number of the Parent and Child Center (PCC) geographic area for which they are applying to serve (see II.B.2 and Appendix E list of PCC geographic areas). Indicate the geographic area number for which you are applying in box # 12, ``areas affected by project'' on page one of the SF 424. C. Application Considerations Applicants will be scored against the evaluation criteria described above. The review will be conducted in Washington, DC. or in an HHS Regional office by a panel consisting of experts in the areas of child and family development and other related fields. The results of the competitive review will be taken into consideration by the Associate Commissioner, Head StartBureau, in recommending the projects to be funded. The Commissioner of ACYF will make the final selection of the applicants to be funded. An application may be funded in whole or in part, depending on the relative need for services, applicant ranking, geographic location and funds available. The Commissioner may elect not to fund applicants that have management, fiscal, or other problems and situations that make it unlikely that they would be able to provide effective Early Head Start services. The Commissioner may decide not to fund projects that would require unreasonably large initial start-up costs for facilities or equipment. Successful applicants will be notified through the issuance of a Financial Assistance Award which sets forth the amount of funds granted, the terms and conditions of the grant, the effective date of the grant, the budget period for which support is given, and the total project period for which support is provided. In awarding grants to eligible applicants, the Commissioner shall ensure an equitable national geographic distribution of the grants and award grants to applicants proposing to serve communities in rural areas and to applicants proposing to serve communities in urban areas. The Commissioner will consider the benefit to communities of funding new providers. Subject to the availability of additional resources in FY 1998 and the number of acceptable applications received as a result of this program announcement, the Commissioner may elect to fund grantees in FY 1998 from the pool of applications submitted in response to this announcement. ACYF will determine when the project period begins for Early Head Start grants. D.

Program Narrative This program narrative section was designed for use by many and varied programs. Consequently, it is not possible to provide specific guidance for developing a program narrative statement that would be appropriate in all cases. Applicants must refer the relevant program announcement for information on specific program requirements and any additional guidelines for preparing the program narrative statement. The following are general guidelines for preparing a program narrative statement. The program narrative provides a major means by which the application is evaluated and ranked to compete with other applications for available assistance. It should be concise and complete and should address the activity for which Federal funds are requested. Supporting documents should be included where they can present information clearly and succinctly. Applicants are encouraged to provide information on their organizational structure, staff, related experience, and other information considered to be relevant. Awarding offices use this and other information to determine whether the applicant has the capability and resources necessary to carry out the proposed project. It is important, therefore, that this information be included in the application. However, in the narrative the applicant must distinguish between resources directly related to the proposed project from those which will not be used in support of the specific project for which funds are requested. Cross-referencing should be used rather than repetition. ACF is particularly interested in specific factual information and statements of measurable goals in quantitative terms. Narratives are evaluated on the basis of substance, not length. Extensive exhibits are not required.(Supporting information concerning activities which will not be directly funded by the grant or information which does not directly pertain to an integral part of the grant funded activity should be placed in an appendix.) Pages should be numbered for easy reference. Prepare the program narrative statement in accordance with the following instructions: Applicants submitting new applications or competing continuation applications should respond to Items A and D. Applicants submitting noncompeting continuation applications should respond to Item B. Applicants requesting supplemental assistance should respond to Item C. A. Project Description\u00d0Components 1. Project Summary/Abstract A summary of the project description (usually a page or less) with reference to the funding request should be placed directly behind the table of contents or SF\u00b1424. 2. Objectives and Need for Assistance Applicants must clearly identify the physical, economic, social, financial, institutional, or other problem(s) requiring a solution. The need for assistance must be demonstrated and the principal and subordinate objectives of the project must be clearly stated; supporting documentation such as letters of support and testimonials from concerned interests other than the applicant may be included. Any relevant data based on planning studies should be included or referenced in the endnotes/ footnotes. Incorporate demographic data and participant/beneficiary information, as needed. In developing the narrative, the applicant may volunteer or be requested to provide information on the total range of projects currently conducted and supported (or to be initiated), some of which may be outside the scope of the program announcement. 3. Results or Benefits Expected Identify results and benefits to be derived. For example, when applying for a grant to establish a neighborhood child care center, describe who will occupy the facility, who will use the facility, how the facility will be used, and how the facility will benefit the community which it will serve. 4. Approach Outline a plan of action which describes the scope and detail of how the proposed work will be accomplished. Account for all functions or activities identified in the application. Cite factors which might accelerate or decelerate the work and state your reason for taking this approach rather than others. Describe any unusual features of the project such as design or technological innovations, reductions in cost or time, or extraordinary social and community involvement. Provide quantitative monthly or quarterly projections of the accomplishments to be achieved for each function or activity in such terms as the number of people to be served and the number of microloans made. When accomplishments cannot be quantified by activity or function, list them in18990 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices chronological order to show the schedule of accomplishments and their target dates. Identify the kinds of data to be collected, maintained, and/or disseminated. (Note that clearance from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget might be needed prior to an information collection.) List organizations, cooperating entities, consultants, or other key individuals who will work on the project along with a short description of the nature of their effort or contribution. 5. Evaluation Provide a narrative addressing how you will evaluate (1) the results of your project and (2) the conduct of your program. In addressing the evaluation of results, state how you will determine the extent to which the program has achieved its stated objectives and the extent to which the accomplishment of objectives can be attributed to the program. Discuss the criteria to be used to evaluate results; explain the methodology that will be used to determine if the needs identified and discussed are being met and if the project results and benefits are being achieved. With respect to the conduct of your program, define the procedures you will employ to determine whether the program is being conducted in a manner consistent with the work plan you presented and discuss the impact of the program's various activities upon the program's effectiveness. 6. Geographic Location Give the precise location of the project and boundaries of the area to be served by the proposed project. Maps or other graphic aids may be attached. 7. Additional Information (Include if Applicable) Additional information may be provided in the body of the program narrative or in the appendix. Refer to the program announcement and ``General Information and Instructions'' for guidance on placement of application materials. Staff and Position Data\u00d0Provide a biographical sketch for key personnel appointed and a job description for each vacant key position. Some programs require both for all positions. Refer to the program announcement for guidance on presenting this information. Generally, a biographical sketch is required for original staff and new members as appointed. Plan for Project Continuance Beyond Grant Support\u00d0A plan for securing resources and continuing project activities after Federal assistance has ceased. Business Plan\u00d0When federal grant funds will be used to make an equity investment, provide a business plan. Refer to the program announcement for guidance on presenting this information. Organization Profiles\u00d0Information on applicant organizations and their cooperating partners such as organization charts, financial statements, audit reports or statements from CPA/Licensed Public Accountant, Employer Identification Numbers, names of bond carriers, contact persons and telephone numbers, child care licenses and other documentation of professional accreditation, information oncompliance with federal/state/local government standards, documentation of experience in program area, and other pertinent information. Any non-profit organization submitting an application must submit proof of its non-profit status in its application at the time of submission. The non-profit agency can accomplish this by providing a copy of the applicant's listing in the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) of the IRS code or by providing a copy of the currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate, or by providing a copy of the articles of incorporation bearing the seal of the State in which the corporation or association is domiciled. Dissemination Plan\u00d0A plan for distributing reports and other project outputs to colleagues and the public. Applicants must provide a description of the kind, volume and timing of distribution. Third-Party Agreements\u00d0Written agreements between grantees and subgrantees or subcontractors or other cooperating entities. These agreements may detail scope of work, work schedules, remuneration, and other terms and conditions that structure or define the relationship. Waiver Request\u00d0A statement of program requirements for which waivers will be needed to permit the proposed project to be conducted. Letters of Support\u00d0Statements from community, public and commercial leaders which support the project proposed for funding. B. Noncompeting Continuation Applications A program narrative usually will not be required for noncompeting continuation applications for nonconstruction programs. Noncompeting continuation applications shall be abbreviated unless the ACF Program Office administering this program has issued a notice to the grantee that a full application will be required. An abbreviated application consists of: 1. The Standard Form 424 series (SF 424, SF 424A, SF\u00b1424B). 2. The estimated or actual unobligated balance remaining from the previous budget period should be identified on an accurate SF\u00b1269 as well as in Section A, Columns (c) and (d) of the SF\u00b1424A. 3. The grant budget, broken down into the object class categories on the 424A, and if category ``other'' is used, the specific items supported must be identified. 4. Required certifications. A full application consists of all elements required for an abbreviated application plus: 1. Program narrative information explaining significant changes to the original program narrative statement, a description of accomplishments from the prior budget period, a projection of accomplishments throughout the entire remaining project period, and any other supplemental information that ACF informs the grantee is necessary. 2. A full budget proposal for the budget period under consideration with a full cost analysis of all budget categories. 3. A corrective action plan, if requested by ACF, to address organizational performance weaknesses.C. Supplemental Requests For supplemental assistance requests, explain the reason for the request and justify the need for additional funding. Provide a budget and budget justification only for those items for which additional funds are requested. (See Item D for guidelines on preparing a budget and budget justification.) D. Budget and Budget Justification Provide line item detail and detailed calculations for each budget object class identified on the Budget Information form. Detailed calculations must include estimation methods, quantities, unit costs, and other similar quantitative detail sufficient for the calculation to be duplicated. The detailed budget must also include a breakout by the funding sources identified in Block 15 of the SF\u00b1424. Provide a narrative budget justification which describes how the categorical costs are derived. Discuss the necessity, reasonableness, and allocability of the proposed costs. The following guidelines are for preparing the budget and budget justification. Both federal and non-federal resources should be detailed and justified in the budget and narrative justification. For purposes of preparing the program narrative, ``federal resources'' refers only to the ACF grant for which you are applying. Non-Federal resources are all other federal and non- federal resources. It is suggested that for the budget, applicants use a column format: Column 1, object class categories; Column 2, federal budget amounts; Column 3, non- federal budget amounts, and Column 4, total amounts. The budget justification should be a narrative. Personnel. Costs of employee salaries and wages. Justification: Identify the project director or principal investigator, if known. For each staff person, show name/title, time commitment to the project (in months), time commitment to the project (as a percentage or full-time equivalent), annual salary, grant salary, wage rates, etc. Do not include costs of consultants or personnel costs of delegate agencies or of specific project(s) or businesses to be financed by the applicant. Fringe Benefits. Costs of employee fringe benefits unless treated as part of an approved indirect cost rate. Justification: Provide a breakdown of amounts and percentages that comprise fringe benefit costs, such as health insurance, FICA, retirement insurance, taxes, etc. Travel. Costs of project related travel by employees of the applicant organization (does not include costs of consultant travel). Justification: For each trip, show the total number of traveler(s), travel destination, duration of trip, per diem, mileage allowances, if privately owned vehicles will be used, and other transportation costs and subsistence allowances. Travel costs for key staff to attend ACF sponsored workshops as specified in this program announcement should be detailed in the budget. Equipment. Costs of all non-expendable, tangible personal property to be acquired by the project where each article has a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition18991 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices cost which equals the lesser of (a) the capitalization level established by the applicant organization for financial statement purposes, or (b) $5000. Justification: For each type of equipment requested, provide a description of the equipment, cost per unit, number of units, total cost, and a plan for use on the project, as well as use or disposal of the equipment after the project ends. Supplies. Costs of all tangible personal property (supplies) other than that included under the Equipment category. Justification: Specify general categories of supplies and their costs. Show computations and provide other information which supports the amount requested. Contractual. Costs of all contracts for services and goods except for those which belong under other categories such as equipment, supplies, construction, etc. Third-party evaluation contracts (if applicable) and contracts with secondary recipient organizations including delegate agencies and specific project(s) or businesses to be financed by the applicant should be included under this category. Justification: All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. If procurement competitions were held or if a sole source procurement is being proposed, attach a list of proposed contractors, indicating the names of the organizations, the purposes of the contracts, the estimated dollar amounts, and the award selection process. Also provide back-up documentation where necessary to support selection process. Note: Whenever the applicant/grantee intends to delegate part of the program to another agency, the applicant/grantee must provide a detailed budget and budget narrative for each delegate agency by agency title, along with the required supporting information referenced in these instructions. Applicants must identify and justify any anticipated procurement that is expected to exceed the simplified purchase threshold (currently set at $100,000) and to be awarded without competition. Recipients are required to make available to ACF pre-award review and procurement documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. under the conditions identified at 45 CFR part 74.44(e). Construction. Costs of construction by applicant or contractor. Justification: Provide detailed budget and narrative in accordance with instructions for other object class categories. Identify which construction activity/costs will be contractual and which will be assumed by the applicant. Other. Enter the total of all other costs. Such costs, where applicable and appropriate, may include but are not limited to insurance, food, medical and dental costs (noncontractual), fees and travel paid directly to individual consultants, space and equipment rentals, printing and publication, computer use, training costs, including tuition and stipends, training service costs including wage payments to individuals and supportive service payments, and staff development costs.Indirect Charges. Total amount of indirect costs. This category should be used only when the applicant currently has an indirect cost rate approved by the Department of Health and Human Services or another cognizant Federal agency. Justification: With the exception of most local government agencies, an applicant which will charge indirect costs to the grant must enclose a copy of the current rate agreement if the agreement was negotiated with a cognizant Federal agency other than the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). If the rate agreement was negotiated with the Department of Health and Human Services, the applicant should state this in the budget justification. If the applicant organization is in the process of initially developing or renegotiating a rate, it should immediately upon notification that an award will be made, develop a tentative indirect cost rate proposal based on its most recently completed fiscal year in accordance with the principles set forth in the pertinent DHHS Guide for Establishing Indirect Cost Rates, and submit it to the appropriate DHHS Regional Office. Applicants awaiting approval of their indirect cost proposals may also request indirect costs. It should be noted that when an indirect cost rate is requested, those costs included in the indirect cost pool should not be also charged as direct costs to the grant. Also, if the applicant is requesting a rate which is less than what is allowed under this program announcement, the authorized representative of your organization needs to submit a signed acknowledgement that the applicant is accepting a lower rate than allowed. Program Income. The estimated amount of income, if any, expected to be generated from this project. Separately show expected program income generated from program support and income generated from other mobilized funds. Do not add or subtract this amount from the budget total. Show the nature and source of income in the program narrative statement. Justification: Describe the nature, source and anticipated use of program income in the budget or reference pages in the program narrative statement which contain this information. Non-Federal Resources. Amounts of non- Federal resources that will be used to support the project as identified in Block 15 of the SF\u00b1424. Justification: The firm commitment of these resources must be documented and submitted with the application in order to be given credit in the review process. Total Direct Charges, Total Indirect Charges, Total Project Costs. (Self explanatory). Certification Regarding Environmental Tobacco Smoke Public Law 103\u00b1227, Part C\u00d0 Environmental Tobacco Smoke, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor routinely owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for provision of health, day care, education, or library services to children under the age of 18, if the servicesare funded by Federal programs either directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee.

This recognition is guiding the design of the new Early Head Start program. Early Head Start marks a turning point in America's commitment to our youngest children and their families. By focusing on child development, family development, community building, and staff development, a new era of support to very young children and their families is born, building on the experiences and lessons learned from existing Head Start programs. Early Head Start puts resources into a constellation of high quality supports and services that will promote healthy child and family development, and backs them with a Federal commitment to training, standards and monitoring for high quality, research and evaluation, and services coordination at the national level. It enables families and communities to design flexible and responsive programs but requires that, at a minimum, programs provide child development, family support, health services for young children and pregnant women, and home visits to families with newborns. This would include child care services that respond to the needs of families. When services are provided through referral, it requires that the Early Head Start program assures the services to which families are referred are of highest quality, available and accessible, and that needed follow-up occurs. And although service delivery mechanisms may vary, a common characteristic will be that each Early Head Start program will establish a place which is recognized as a source of support for very young children, families, and caregiving staff. Programs will be encouraged to give this Early Head Start place visibility and identity. With this design, the Early Head Start program will be suited to last well into the next century, always reshaping itself to provide high quality, responsive, and respectful services to America's youngest children and their families. Background, Vision, and Goals The reauthorization of the Head Start Act in 1994 made it possible to formally open a new chapter of Federal support for families with infants and toddlers by establishing a special initiative within the context of the Head Start program. Beginning in Fiscal Year 1995, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to Early Head Start programs which will provide early,continuous, intensive, and comprehensive child development and family support services to low-income families with children under age three. This initiative will bring together under one umbrella Head Start's existing programs for families with infants and toddlers, the Comprehensive Child Development Program and the Parent and Child Centers; strengthen the Migrant Head Start Program; and add new resources to model high quality child development and family development services for very young children and their families. To help with the design of the new initiative, the Secretary formed the Advisory Committee on Services for Families with Infants and Toddlers. The Committee was charged with advising the Secretary and Assistant Secretary for Children and Families on the development of program approaches for the initiative that would address the parenting and child development need of low-income parents and their infants and toddlers. We were to pay particular attention to the key principles and array of models of effective culturally and developmentally appropriate service delivery. To fulfill this commitment, we met three times during the summer of 1994 to engage in discussions about our vision for a national approach to high quality, responsive services for very young children and their families. We outlined the Federal role for carrying forth this vision, ensuring such programs can flourish. We are excited about the fruits of these deliberative efforts and confident that the resulting initiative will advance Head Start leadership in realizing a national vision of communities where: Children, from birth, receive support through their family and their community to achieve optimal growth and development and build a foundation of security, self- confidence and character strength which will in turn enable them to build successful social relationships for learning and continued development through later childhood and adulthood; Families receive support to meet their personal goals, and resources and guidance to prepare for their child's birth and provide a warm, caring, responsive environment for their very young child; Communities embrace and support all families, celebrating the birth of their children and creating an environment where support and resources are mobilized to ensure a comprehensive, integrated array of services are available and accessible for all very young children and their families; and Staff receive the professional education and personal support they need to provide high quality environments and experiences and engage in responsive relationships that promote the healthy development of infants, toddlers, and their families. In keeping with this vision, the goals set forth by the Advisory Committee for Early Head Start will be: To provide safe and developmentally enriching caregiving and environments which promote the physical, cognitive, social and emotional growth of infants and toddlers and prepare them for future growth and development;To support parents , both mothers and fathers, in their role as primary caregivers and educators of their children, and families in meeting personal goals and achieving self- sufficiency across a wide variety of domains; To mobilize communities to provide the resources and environment necessary to ensure a comprehensive, integrated array of services and support for families, and to foster the systems change necessary to summon forth the guiding vision of this initiative; and To ensure the provision of high quality responsive services to families with infants and toddlers through the development of highly-trained, caring and adequately compensated program staff. The Advisory Committee recognizes that the vision and goals outlined above have also been shaped by the lessons learned from the Comprehensive Child Development Program, Parent and Child Centers, Migrant Head Start Programs, locally designed Head Start programs, and other early child development and family support efforts serving families with very young children. As part of the overall consultation for the development of this initiative, Federal staff conducted over 30 focus groups with parents, practitioners, researchers, advocates, and representatives of professional organizations. Focus groups were designed to address topical areas such as child care, family services, health care, support and services for children with disabilities and their families, community mobilization, parent involvement and parent advocacy. In addition, Federal staff met with or received materials and recommendations from a number of other experts and practitioners in the field. The suggestions, guidance, and information received through this process have been invaluable to both the Advisory Committee and the Administration on Children, Youth and Families. Research Rationale Findings from more than three decades of research in child and family development support the vision and goals set forth for support to families with infants and toddlers. We know that the time from conception to age three is a critical period of human development, as change occurs more rapidly than in any other period of the life span. Growth in these early years establishes the basic foundation for future development. For infants and toddlers to develop optimally, they must have health beginnings and the continuity of responsive and caring relationships. Together, these supports help promote optimal cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and language development. When these supports are missing, the immediate and future development of the child may be comprised. Fortunately, recent research identifies characteristics of effective programs that enhance both child and family development. This growing body of knowledge provides a solid base upon which the Early Head Start program can be founded. Maternal and Infant Health Maternal and infant health are essential for ensuring normal pre- and post-natal development of very young children. Late or inadequate prenatal care, malnutrition, stress18994 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices and exposure to harmful substances are associated with shortened gestation, reduced birthweight, birth defects and underdeveloped brain growth (Osofsky, 1975; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1989; Carnegie Corporation, 1994). These, in turn, have been associated with higher probabilities for infant mortality, illness, disabilities, child abuse, difficulty in relationships (Glasgow and Overall, 1979) and subsequent learning disorders (Drillien, Thomson and Bargoyne, 1980). During the early years of life, proper nutrition, routine well-child health care, timely immunizations, safe environments and health-promoting behaviors are necessary to support physical growth and development. Given the paramount importance of health for very young children, a major focus of the Early Head Start program must be to ensure women receive the health services needed to promote a healthy pregnancy and birth, and very young children receive early and ongoing well-baby care, immunizations, and other essential health services to support their development. Child-Caregiver Relationships The child-caregiver relationships with the mother, father, grandparent and other caregivers are critical for providing infants and toddlers support, engagement, continuity and emotional nourishment necessary for healthy development, and the development of healthy attachments (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters and Wall, 1978). Within the context of caregiving relationships, the infant builds a sense of what is expected, what feels right in the world, as well as skills and incentives for social turn-taking, reciprocity and cooperation (Emde, Biringen, Clyman and Oppenheim, 1991; Isabella and Belsky, 1991). The infant's activities are nourished and channeled in appropriate ways so as to encourage a sense of initiative and self- directedness. During the toddler period, the child, through repeated interactions with emotionally-available caregivers, also begins to learn basic skills of self-control, emotional regulation and negotiation (Kochanska, 1991; Kopp, 1989; Suess, Grossman and Sroufe, 1992). Empathy for others and prosocial tendencies for caring and helping also develop during toddlerhood as well as the emotions of pride and shame; experiencing and learning about these capacities require responsive caregiving relationships in the midst of life's inevitable stresses and challenges (Zahn-Waxler and Radke-Yarrow, 1990). A sense of pleasure, interest in exploration, early imaginative capacities, and the sharing of positive emotions also begin in infancy\u00d0 all of which require repeated and consistent caregiver relationship experiences and form a basis for social competence that carries through toddlerhood and the preschool period (Emde, 1989; Dix, 1991). The opportunities for play for both infant and caregiver, as well as the skills that develop from play, are often under-appreciated aspects of healthy development (Bruner, 1986; Elicker, Englund and Sroufe, 1992). Finally, the importance of promoting a network of healthy caregiving relationships for the very young child cannot be and Morelli, 1985). The network of caring relationships provides an ever-expanding circle of support for both child and family. Factors that undermine optimal child-caregiver relationships include isolation, lack of support and maternal depression (Crnic, Greenberg, Robinson and Ragozin, 1984), the latter reported to be a high as 56% in some samples of low-income new mothers (Hall, Gurley, Sachs and Kryscio, 1991). In child care settings, high staff turnover, low staff wages, low quality programming and lack of adequate staff training for substitute caregivers negatively affects the quality of child-caregiver relationships (Zigler and Lang, 1991; Whitebook, Howes and Phillips, 1989). This in turn further compromises the nature and quality of the child's overall development. Thus, it follows that a major focus for Early Head State services should be the development of healthy and skillful relationship building between very young children and their parents and caregivers that encourages interactions and promotes attention and activity in infants. Hence, opportunities for sustained relationship- building over extended periods of times will be an explicit goal throughout the program. Characteristics of Successful Programs Serving Families With Infants and Toddlers The goal of many early child development programs is to enable the child, with the support of the parents as primary caregivers and other caregivers, to establish a developmental path that will prepare him or her for long-term success. Hundreds of programs with a variety of specific emphases have sought to achieve this goal. From these many interventions, a picture of the critical ingredients for successful programs has emerged. In short, we know effective programs often are characterized by: early prenatal services to the expectant woman (Olds, Henderson, Tatelbaum and Chamberlin, 1986); a two-generational focus (Zuckerman and Braxelton, 1994; Administration on Children, Youth that address self- sufficiency through the provision of social services and parent education (Booth, Barnard, Mitchell and Speiker, 1987; Olds, Henderson, Tatebaum and Chamberlin, 1986; Olds, Henderson, Tatebaum and Chamberlin, 1988); quality child development services that are coupled with services (Lally, continuity of service delivery for the child and family that ensures the availability of support over a number of years with smooth transitions to other service delivery systems (Campbell and Ramey, 1994); continutity of caregivers (Howes and Hamilton, 1992); intensity of service delivery in terms of availability, accessibility, and usage of services (Booth, Barnard, Mitchell and Ramey, Bryant, Wasik, Sparling, Fendt and LaVange, 1992); and consolidation or integration of service delivery systems. Further, research tells us that communities have been found tobecome more responsive to the needs of low- income families as a result of program activities (Kirschner, 1970). Clearly, research over the past three decades has shown that when programs focus on both child development and family development through early, high quality, comprehensive, continuous, intensive services, opportunities of optimal child and family development can be realized, even for the most vulnerable families and very young children. The challenge for the Administration on Children, Youth and Families and the programs which will receive funds through this initiative is to translate these research findings into the design and operation of high quality programs so all families with young children served by Early Head Start will be able to grow and prosper. The following principles and cornerstones establish the framework for this to occur. Program Principles In recognition that each child is an individual who is supported by a family and that families are supported by neighborhoods and communities, the Advisory Committee recommends that programs funded under the new initiative be encouraged to develop a range of strategies for supporting the growth of the very young child within the family and the growth of the family within the community. Thus, each Early Head Start program should be family-centered and community-based. We recommend that the following principles serve as the conceptual foundation for Early Head Start: High Quality: Commitment to excellence will enable the new programs to be models for services to families with infants and toddlers from all socioeconomic strata of society. High quality will be assured in the direct services provided, and in the services provided through referral. To this end, each program will acknowledge and utilize the bodies of knowledge, skills and professional ethics surrounding the fields of child development, family development and community building. In particular, programs will recognize that the conception-to-three age period is unique in both the rate of development and in the way young children's physical and mental growth reflects and absorbs experiences with caregivers and the surroundings. Thus, high quality caregiving practices will spring from the healthy awareness that the unique nature of infant and toddler development not only carries with it major opportunities for intervention, but also leaves children especially vulnerable to negative inputs. The Federal government will share in the commitment to high quality by providing thorough and ongoing monitoring to assure program adherence to performance standards; technical assistance that addresses each program's individual needs and amplifies innovation and development across all programs; evaluation which measures program success against meaningful outcomes for young children and families; and research which contributes to the state of the art on child development, family development and community building. Prevention and Promotion: Recognizing that windows of opportunity open and close18995 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices quickly for families and young children, programs will seek and pursue opportunities to play a positive role in promoting the physical, social, emotional, cognitive and language development of young children and families before conception, prenatally, upon birth, and during the early years. By supporting the promotion of their health and well-being, program staff will be able to prevent and detect problems at their earliest stages, rallying the services needed to help the child and family anticipate and overcome problems before they interfere with healthy development. While early and proactive promotion of healthy development and healthy behaviors will be emphasized, programs will also need to be able to understand and respond to family crises that may occur while the family is enrolled in the program. Positive Relationships and Continuity: The success of each program will rest on its ability to support and enhance strong, caring, continuous relationships which nurture the child, parents, family, and caregiving staff. Programs will support the mother-child, father-child bond by recognizing each parent as his or her child's first and primary source of love, nurturance and guidance. Caregiving will be provided to families who need it in ways that support infant and toddler attachment to a limited number of skilled and caring individuals, thus maintaining relationships with caregivers over time and avoiding the trauma of loss experienced with frequent turnover of key people in the child's life. These relationships will aim to respectfully enhance child interest, curiosity, play and imagination, which, in turn, will develop a shared sense of trust, confidence and esteem for both caregiver and child. In addition, programs will model strong, mutually respectful relationships between staff and families, among staff, and with other community organizations and service providers. To do so, programs will be receptive to individual strengths, perspectives and contributions; affirm the value of the child and family's home culture; and support an environment where very young children, parents and staff can teach and learn from each other. Parent Involvement: As in all Head Start efforts, a hallmark of the new initiative will be the creation and sustenance of an environment that supports the highest level of partnership with parents, both mothers and fathers. As such programs, will support parents as primary nurturers, educators, and advocates for their children; assure that each parent has an opportunity for an experience that supports his or her own growth and goals, including that of parenting; and provide a policy- and decision-making role for parents. Furthermore, opportunities for parent involvement will encourage independence and self-sufficiency for parents. Special efforts will be made to welcome and support fathers as parenting partners. Inclusion: Programs will seek to build communities that respect each child and adult as an individual while at the same time reinforcing a sense of belonging to the group. Programs will support participation in community life by young children withdisabilities and their families; families of very young children with significant disabilities will be fully included in all program services. Culture: Children and their families will come to the new programs rooted in a culture which gives them meaning and direction. Programs will demonstrate an understanding of, respect for, and responsiveness to the home culture and home language of every child, thus affirming the values of each family's culture and providing the context for healthy identity development in the early years of life. Program staff will become aware of their own core beliefs and values and be attuned to the role culture and language play in child development, family development and the surrounding community values and attitudes. Programs will pursue opportunities to support home culture and language, while also recognizing the significance of a common culture shared by all. In building a more harmonious and peaceful community for children to grow in and for families to share, programs will encourage and provide opportunities for families and community members to engage in dialogue about culture, language, cultural diversity and multiculturalism. Comprehensiveness, Flexibility, Responsiveness, and Intensity: Programs will honor and build upon the unique strengths and abilities of the children, families and communities they serve and continually adapt to meet emerging needs. Developmental opportunities provided to each infant and toddler will address the whole child and be continually adapted to keep pace with his or her developmental growth. And just as programs need to be responsive and attentive to the special needs of very young children with disabilities, they also need to be responsive to parents with disabilities. Family development planning and service provision will be grounded in the belief that families, including those whose problems seem overwhelming, can identify their own goals, strengths and needs, and are capable of growth and change. Once these are identified, program resources of varied intensity will be marshaled to support the whole family in an individualized and responsive manner. Barriers which prevent families from accessing needed supports will be overcome through the location, coordination, and assurance by program staff that services are provided and received. Attention will also be given to ensure programs meet the needs and schedules of working parents. Ultimately, each parent's sense of empowerment and ability to identify and address his or her family's needs will be fostered by responsive and caring relationships with program staff. Transition: Programs will be responsible for ensuring the smooth transition of children and their families into Head Start or other preschool programs which are of high quality and provide consistent and responsive caregiving. The Federal government must support both Early Head Start and Head Start programs in carrying out this responsibility. Transition is important for ensuring continued accessibility to enriching early child development experiences and for providing ongoing family support servicesthat promote healthy family development. To facilitate this transition, parents and caregivers should jointly develop a family and child transition plan, identifying services which will continue and new services and programs which will be accessed. Caregivers from both Early Head Start and the new service programs will share responsibility for coordinating and implementing the plan. Collaboration: Recognizing that no one program will be able to meet all of a child's and family's needs, programs will initiate or become embedded in an integrated community system of service providers and strength building organizations such as churches and other religious institutions, schools and civic groups. These efforts will foster a caring, comprehensive and integrated community-wide response to families with young children, thus maximizing scarce financial resources and avoiding duplication of agency effort. Likewise, the Federal government will promote systems change and the efficient use of resources through the active pursuit of local, State and Federal partnerships which enhance the capacity of local programs to collaborate and combine financial resources. Program Cornerstones The principles outlined above establish the foundation for Early Head Start, a program that meets child development, family development, and health related goals while striving to provide high quality, comprehensive, and individualized support and services. In order to accomplish this, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Secretary of Health and Human Services adopt these key elements as the four cornerstones for Early Head Start: child development, family development, community building, and staff development. Child Development Programs will seek to enhance and advance each child's development by providing individualized support that honors the unique characteristics and pace of infant/ toddler physical, social, emotional, cognitive and language development, including early education and health care. Critical to this development is the promotion of positive parent-child interactions and the enhancement of each parent's knowledge about the development of their child within healthy, safe environments. An early step for providing this support to parents will be the provision of home visits to families with newborns to offer early encouragement and support and build bridges for families to other resources in the community. Also critical to the child's development is access to and delivery of comprehensive health and mental health services for children, including regular child health care; screening for health problems such as hearing, anemia, lead poisoning, metabolic problems; immunizations; nutritional assessment; developmental surveillance and anticipatory guidance. All children deserve a medical home that provides these and other prevention and treatment services. To help facilitate this, Early Head Start programs will collaborate with a variety of organizations and disciplines to ensure health supervision for children and their families.18996 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices It is particularly important that Early Head Start ensure coordination and continuity of services for infants and toddlers with or at risk of a disability, who are eligible for services through Early Head Start and Part H of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. These two service systems should be coordinated and integrated so that families and their children experience a seamless system of services, as identified in their family development plan or individualized service plan. As programs provide child development services, they must ensure that infants and toddlers who need child care receive high quality part- and full-day services. Such child care can be provided directly or in collaboration with other community providers as long as the Early Head Start program assumes responsibility for ensuring that all settings meet the Early Head Start performance standards. In general, the setting where these services are delivered is left to local option and the preferences of families as identified through their individual family development plan. Settings can represent a range of options including home visiting; family support centers; family child care homes; child care centers; centers where families are engaged in education, training, or employment; community health centers; and others. Family Development Programs must recognize that the key to optimal child development and family development is the empowerment of parents in goal setting for themselves and their children. Therefore, families and staff will collaboratively design and update individualized family development plans which ensure that service delivery strategies are rooted in the foundation principles and are responsive to the goals and ideals of the families. When families are served by additional programs which also require an individualized family service plan, such as Part H of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and family employability plans, then a single coordinated plan should be developed so families experience a seamless system of services. Based on the plan, programs will ensure the provision of a full range of family services which consider the different support and educational opportunities needed by new parents, pregnant women and expectant fathers, and potential parents, as well as by siblings and extended family members who influence the development of the family and very young child. It is particularly important that parental health is linked to children's health and development. As such, health services for parents need to be included as part of a two- generational model of health care. Health services must be accessible for parents with a special emphasis on women's health that occurs prior to, during, and after pregnancy. Services which programs must provide directly or through referral, and which local Early Head Start programs must actively ensure are of high quality and appropriately followed up include: child development information; health services, including services for women prior to, during, and afterpregnancy; mental health services; services to improve health behavior such as smoking cessation and substance abuse treatment; services to adults to support self-sufficiency, including adult education and basic literacy skills, job training, assistance in obtaining income support, food, and decent, safe housing, and emergency cash or in-kind assistance; and transportation to program services. Programs must provide directly opportunities for parent involvement in the program so that parents can be involved as decisionmakers, volunteers, and/or employees. Additional services not listed above, but identified by families through community needs assessments and mappings, may be provided either directly or through referral at local option. Community Building The commitment of programs to high quality care for very young children and their families services as a catalyst for creating a community environment that shares responsibility for the healthy development of its children. A program approach that exemplifies openness and caring is the start of community building. Programs should function in communities in a way that mirrors the principles that are the foundation of the program itself: parents become a vital resources for each other and the community at large; staff nurture networks of support; and programs develop relationships of trust with other community institutions, businesses, and with community leaders. By becoming a key actor in the life of the community, programs can serve to mobilize community resources and energies on behalf of children and families. Essential to community building is ensuring a comprehensive network of services and supports for very young children and their families which are culturally responsive. Programs will be expected to establish collaborative relationships with other community providers and strength-building organizations such as churches and other religious institutions, schools and civic groups. The goal of these relationships will be three-fold: increased access to high quality serves for program families; assurance that the program's approach to serving families with infants and toddlers fits into the existing constellation of services in the community so that there is a coherent, integrated approach to supporting families with very young children; and systems change which will spark community caring and responsive service delivery for all the families with young children who live there. Thus, all programs will be required to conduct an in-depth assessment of existing community resources and needs and engage in an ongoing collaborative planning process with a range of stakeholders, including parents and residents of the community. Staff Development Programs are only as good as the individuals who staff them. This is particularly true of programs which serve young children, since the potential to do harm during the vulnerable years of infancy and toddlerhood is so great. Thus, staffdevelopment has been included as a key element in order to underscore its centrality to the success of the initiative. Programs will be required to select staff who, together, cover the spectrum of skills, knowledge and professional competencies necessary to provide high quality, comprehensive, culturally appropriate, and family-centered services to young children and families. Equally critical will be each program's ability to recognize individuals capable of entering into one-to-one caregiving relationships with infants and toddlers which support the positive formation of their identities. Likewise, programs will need to identify the capacity of potential staff members to develop caring, respectful and empowering relationships with families and other coworkers. Such individuals will demonstrate characteristics such as high self- esteem, personal strength, and the capacity for being emotionally available. The program directors who make these selections will, themselves, need to possess these characteristics in addition to being highly skilled administraters who exemplify leadership qualities such as integrity, warmth, intuition and holistic thinking. Ongoing staff training, supervision and mentoring of both line staff and supervisors will be an integral part of staff development. Such training, supervision, and mentoring will reflect an interdisciplinary approach and emphasis on relationship building. Staff training programs will ensure that staff are ``cross-trained'' in the areas of child development, family development and community building. Particular emphasis will be placed on building skills in the areas of home visiting; caregiving relationships; effective communication with parents; family literacy; healthy/safe environments and caregiving practices; early identification of unhealthy behaviors or health problems; service coordination; and the provision of services and support to diverse populations, including families and children with disabilities and developmental delays. In addition, training efforts and supervision will be designed to develop each staff person's capacity to function as a member of a well- integrated, diverse and mutually supportive team comprised of families and other staff. To this end, training and supervision will support opportunities for practice, feedback and reflection. Another strategy for training is the development of multi-disciplinary teams of caregivers who can engage in team teaching, sharing concerns and problems, exploring different approaches, and learning practical skills for working with participants of the program and service providers from other relevant delivery systems. As such, training will model and reinforce the foundation principles of this initiative. And finally, staff selection, training and supervision will be grounded in the knowledge that high quality performance and development occurs when they are linked to rewards such as salary, compensation, and career advancement; provided in environments that spark curiosity, excitement and openness to new ideas; and grounded in best practices revealed by ongoing research, evaluation and monitoring.18997 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices Federal Commitment Both individual programs and the Federal government must work hand in hand to realize the vision, principles, and program concept outlined above for the Early Head Start program. The Advisory Committee believes that a Federal commitment to training, monitoring, research and evaluation, and partnership building which respects and supports local program responsibility, initiative, and flexibility is paramount for the programs' success. In addition, Federal commitment is also needed to support and learn from existing Federal programs serving families with infants and toddlers so that they will have the opportunity to achieve excellence and meet the standards that will be set forth for this initiative. With this commitment, we feel the initiative for families with infants and toddlers will be able to serve as a national laboratory both testing and exemplifying quality child development and family development programs. Training Clearly the quality of programs is contingent upon the ongoing support and development of program staff who are trained in the various disciplines which support the principles of family-centered services. As described earlier, program staff need to be able to facilitate both the development of very young children and the development of families. But in too many communities, staff who can play this dual role are few or nonexistent. The Advisory Committee urges the Secretary to engage in public-private partnerships aimed at establishing a cadre of highly trained practitioners and trainers who will be able to support the development of very young children and their families. Such an effort should extend beyond the scope of the new initiative for families with infants and toddlers, so that children cared for in a variety of settings will benefit from this commitment to enhancing the quality and quantity of caregivers. An example of such a partnership would be a commitment on the part of the Federal government to work with institutions of higher learning to ensure multi-disciplinary pre-service education and field work experience is available for students who wish to work in family-focused programs serving very young children and their families. Another example would be partnering with the foundation or philanthropic community to develop scholarship programs for low-income students desiring but unable to enter the field. A further example is coordinating with organizations of professional trainers to ensure they have the skills, resources and supports needed to work with programs providing early, continuous, intensive and comprehensive services and support to very young children and their families. When designing the specific training and technical assistance plan for Early Head Start, the Federal government must focus on the whole spectrum of support and services that are needed for developing and advancing high quality staff, from pre-service and in- service training to supervision and mentoring. These supports and services mustbe provided in a continuous, holistic, responsive manner with the goal of building and nurturing the highest quality caregiving in all programs. In addition to the focus on training, the Federal government also needs to take the lead in modeling a commitment to and respect for the importance of the caregiving profession. Given this, the Advisory Committee urges the Secretary to implement the Early Head Start program so that it models appropriate competencies, institutionalization of career ladders for staff working within the programs, and provision of staff salaries that are comparable to the importance of the job. Monitoring All programs need support and guidance to engage in continuous improvement. As directed by the legislation, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services must provide this support and guidance through ongoing monitoring of the operation of these programs, evaluating their effectiveness, and providing training and technical assistance tailored to the particular needs of such programs. The Advisory Committee reminds the Secretary that performance standards must be developed and issued in order to set forth the expectation of high quality services and environments for programs serving families with infants and toddlers. It is recommended that there be consistency in the principles and framework of the Early Head Start and Head Start performance standards, with the goal being a seamless approach to Federal performance standards for children from birth to age five. While the goal should be a seamless approach, clearly the content of the standards will vary to reflect the differences in development of children during the age span. Once these are issued, monitoring should become a tool for both measuring progress toward these high quality standards and for engaging in continuous improvement. Research and Evaluation Evaluation of Early Head Start is essential for determining the effectiveness of the initiative and for advancing our understanding about which services work best for different families under different circumstances. Evaluation data and information collected at the local level as part of management information systems and ethnographic research are helpful to provide ongoing feedback to programs and support staff in packaging and delivering a comprehensive array of services which are responsive to and reflective of the individual needs of very young children and their families. The Advisory Committee believes that the Secretary must approach evaluation not just as a mechanism for producing summary statistics and reports about the changes in child and family development as a result of these new efforts, but as a tool for individual programs so that they can continuously refine their practices based on feedback from their own program evaluation. This feedback is essential to identify the particular conditions and activities that enable parents and other caregivers to most successfullysupport children's development. It is also essential to test and refine as appropriate the quality of planning, training, staff selection, supervision and program management that is crucial to program success. These lessons learned will benefit local Early Head Start programs, add new knowledge to the fields of child and family development, and will help shape future efforts at the Federal level for very young children and their families. In keeping with the Head Start national laboratory role, we encourage research that examines variations in Early Head Start experiences on child development to learn more about the effectiveness of different interventions for very young children and their families. Accordingly, we encourage the testing of new models which might focus on linkages between this initiative and welfare reform, special coordination with Part H of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or efforts to support teen parents who are either in school or training. Equally important will be research that identifies features of intervention which optimize relationship building, and research that examines variations in caregiving experiences as they influence child development. We also recommend that research and evaluation for this initiative be part of an overall research agenda for Head Start which places Head Start in the broader context of research on young children, families, and communities; ensures a commitment to ongoing themes; and has the flexibility to respond to new and emerging developments in the broader early childhood and family development fields. Partnership Building Just as local programs will be required to coordinate services in the State and community to ensure a comprehensive array of services, the Federal government must also build partnerships across programs, agencies and departments to facilitate effective integration and coordination of resources and services. The Advisory Committee points out that it is especially important that the Head Start Bureau work with the U.S. Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the Medicaid program to enhance the availability of and access to comprehensive health services for pregnant women, and very young children and their families. The Advisory Committee particularly recommends Federal leadership in the development of services that are scarce in communities, such as mental health services that meet the needs of families with infants and toddlers. It is equally important that linkages be made with the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services and the Federal Interagency Coordination Council so that there is a clear message from the Federal government about the importance of partnership around early intervention at the Federal, State and community levels, especially between this initiative and Part H of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The formation of a single Federal Interagency Coordination Council to address services for families with infants and toddlers who are served by Head Start and/18998 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Notices or by Part H is recommended. Further, the Head Start Bureau is advised to develop partnerships with the National Institute of Child Health and Development and the National Institute of Mental Health so that programmatic and research activities can be coordinated and the results benefit and influence the work of all institutions. Beyond coordination and partnership building among the many programs, agencies, and departments of the Federal government, the Advisory Committee advises the Head Start Bureau to continue consultation with professional organizations from relevant child and family development disciplines. Such consultation will help staff of the Head Start Bureau learn about emerging knowledge and apply this to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of this and other programs. Finally, it is equally important that the Head Start Bureau reevaluate its own regulations and procedures to support local creativity and responsiveness to the needs of very young children and their families. As a first step, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Secretary explore opportunities for Early Head Start programs to combine these resources with other public and private funding sources in order to serve more very young children and their families who might benefit from Early Head Start services and support. This is especially important as many Advisory Committee members feel that all children within a very low income community should be afforded access to these services. By allowing and encouraging Early Head Start communities to partner with other funding streams, it may be possible in some communities to provide access to most or all families with very young children. Funding All of the above issues\u00d0from the principles to the program concept and Federal commitments\u00d0are moot when there are not adequate resources to develop and sustain high quality in each program. Advisory Committee members see the role of Early Head Start as a national laboratory and catalyst for change. The members point out that a Federal commitment is needed to ensure that resources are available in the short- and long-term to support the provision of high quality, well-integrated services. Conclusion Early Head Start represents a new era of support for America's youngest children and their families. It sets forth a vision that honors the unique strengths of very young children, their families and communities, and the staff who work with them. It calls for programs to provide family-centered and community-based services and supports that are individualized, of highest quality, and that promote positive health and development. And it commands significant attention at the Federal level for training, technical assistance, monitoring, and research and evaluation to ensure these programs can flourish. The members of the Advisory Committee on Services for Families with Infants and Toddlers are proud to set forth this visionand implementation design for Early Head Start. We call on the Secretary and the nation to move ahead rapidly with a series of steps to make this vision a reality. So much is at stake for our youngest children and their families.

This insurance could only be issued when the Secretary of Commerce found that war risk insurance was commercially unavailable on reasonable terms and conditions. The war risk insurance program was established to provide the insurance necessary to enable air commerce to continue to the event of war. This was needed because of several factors: commercial war risk insurance policies contained automatic cancellation clauses in the event of major war; the geographical coverage of commercial war risk insurance could be restricted upon reasonable notice to air carriers; and rates for commercial war risk insurance could be raised without limit upon reasonable notice to air carriers. The Aviation Insurance Program was incorporated in Title XIII of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Statutory responsibility for the program was subsequently transferred to the Department of Transportation at the time of its creation in 1967. The Secretary of Transportation later delegated this authority to the Federal Aviation Administrator (39 CFR 1.47(b)). The definition of war risk in Title XIII was that traditionally employed by commercial underwriters and, as a matter of policy, the FAA had always conservatively interpreted the definition. In the early 1970's, this definition led to uncertainty about the extent of the Administrator's statutory authority to provide insurance against loss or damage arising from, for example, undeclared wars, hijackings, and terrorist acts. Because of a combination of the progressive exclusion of these new risk from commercial all risk policies, and the failure of the traditional definition of war risk to cover these risks, a potential gap in insurance coverage occurred with the possibility of abrupt termination of important air services in emergency situations. In recognition of the fact that the Administrator needed broad insurance authority in extraordinary circumstances to insure air services determined to be in the national interest, Congress amended Title XIII on November 9, 1977. These amendments, included in Public Law (Pub. L.) 95\u00b119009 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules 163, removed from Title XIII all references to risk categories. They authorized the Administrator to provide insurance against loss or damage due to any risk arising from operations of aircraft in foreign air commerce or between two points outside the United States deemed by the President to be in the foreign policy interests of the United States. However, such insurance could only be issued if commercial insurance for those operations was not available on reasonable terms and conditions. The January 15, 1986, amendment to part 198 reflected the 1977 amendments to Title XIII. Between 1975 and 1990, there was little use of the insurance authority. The FAA, insured without premium, about 50 military charter flights from the United States to Central America in 1983 and 1984. Otherwise, commercial insurance for flights to most areas of the world was available. Since 1990, the Aviation Insurance Program has been used much more than in the 1975\u00b11990 period, but air carriers can usually still obtain commercial insurance. Since 1990, the Aviation Insurance Program has been mostly used to provide insurance for civil aircraft chartered by the military. The Department of Defense (DoD) under the National Airlift Policy relies on civil air carriers to meet its airlift requirements. Under the Civil Reserve Airfleet (CRAF) program, DoD contractually obligates airlines to provide aircraft and flight crews to meet mobilization transport requirements in exchange for shares of peacetime DoD transport business. This saves the DoD the expense of purchasing, operating, and maintaining a large standby transport aircraft fleet. Although the CRAF program is available, DoD usually can meet its transport requirements with aircraft and crews volunteered by the CRAF airlines without formal activation of the program. In fact, the CRAF has been activated only once in its history\u00d0 during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. Gaps between the FAA and commercial insurance coverage appeared during Operation Desert Shield/Storm as a result of the CRAF activation and the long post-Vietnam hiatus in program activity. Two such gaps could not be closed without new legislation. The more significant was the inability to cover domestic CRAF flight segments. Most of the airlines' commercial hull or liability war risk insurance policies excluded coverage for all CRAF flights while, by law, FAA- issued non-premium insurance could cover by only international flight segments. Thus, the airlines had to rely on direct indemnification from the DoDfor coverage of CRAF domestic flight segments (e.g., usually ferry flights to a military base to pick up troops and supplies destined for the theater of operations). In addition, flights transporting armed forces and military materiel on behalf of and pursuant to an agreement between the U.S. government and a foreign government, but not operated under a U.S. government contract, could not be covered by non- premium insurance. Title IV of the Airport and Airway Safety, Capacity, Noise Improvement and Intermodal Transportation Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102\u00b1 581, gave FAA the authority to provide non-premium insurance coverage for these two previously uncoverable categories of flights. The FAA has been able to fill other coverage gaps administratively with successive revisions to its insurance policies, such as the costs of search and rescue attempts, runway foaming, and damage while the aircraft is outside the insured's control. In 1994, Congress codified the Federal Aviation Act including the Aviation Insurance Program and related statutes into the main body of Title 49, United States Code (USC) at Chapter 443. Aviation Insurance Program Currently, Chapter 443 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation, subject to approval by the President, to provide aviation insurance coverage for American aircraft or foreign-flag aircraft operations deemed necessary to carry out the foreign policy of the United States and for which commercial insurance is unavailable on reasonable terms. This is a discretionary program. This insurance can be issued in two forms: Non-Premium Insurance is issued for American aircraft under contract to any Federal department or agency which has an indemnity agreement with the Department of Transportation (DOT). Applicants currently pay a one- time binder fee of $200 per aircraft for non-premium insurance. This fee has not been adjusted since 1975. The Presidential approval required for the issuance of non-premium insurance is demonstrated by the standing Presidential approval of the indemnification agreements with the other Government agencies. In order to minimize the time needed to provide non-premium insurance coverage, upon receipt of the application from the carrier, the FAA will issue the carrier a standby non-premium insurance coverage, upon receipt of the application from the carrier, the FAA will issue the carrier a standby non- premium policy which lists theregistered aircraft of that carrier. Actual coverage for operations of these aircraft commences upon formal activation notice from the FAA which will detail the conditions and limits of the activated policy. Premium Insurance is provided for American aircraft or foreign-flag aircraft for regular commercial scheduled or charter service. The U.S. Government assumes the financial liability for claims in exchange for a premium. The Presidential approval required for premium insurance must be separately obtained for a period of not more than 60 days. The Presidential approval may be renewed for additional 60 day periods if so approved before each additional period. Under certain circumstances, this renewal authority has been and may be delegated to the Secretary of Transportation. As a general policy, premium insurance will not be made available for a U.S. government agency, whereas such agencies may request non-premium insurance. Non-premium and premium insurance do not necessarily differ in risks covered for any given flight. The differences are in the categories of flights which may be covered and in the approval process. As noted above, wholly domestic flights may be covered by non-premium insurance whereas premium insurance may cover only flights between a U.S. point and a foreign point or between two foreign points. Presidential approval is specific to flights within the scope of each request for premium insurance, while Presidential approval is generic to all non-premium flights for agencies which have completed an indemnification agreement with the FAA. Two basic types of coverage are offered under the FAA's Aviation Insurance Program, with limits of liability provided as follows: Hull insurance covers the loss of or damage to an aircraft hull. Coverage may not exceed the reasonable value of the aircraft as determined by the Secretary. Liability insurance covers bodily injury, personal injury, or death, and damage to or loss of property, including cargo, baggage, and personal effects. Coverage may not exceed the registered limits of liability on file with the FAA or the corresponding commercial coverage in effect on the date of loss. Recent Experience The FAA issued non-premium war risk insurance for over 5,000 flights in support of Operation Desert Shield/ Storm. These flights were utilized to carry both troops and supplies into the19010 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules Middle East and evacuate American citizens from the area. Premium war risk insurance also was provided during Operation Desert Shield/Storm for 36 flights. The FAA also has issued non- premium insurance for flights supporting recent humanitarian and peacekeeping operations. The FAA insured 155 flights by 11 different air carriers carrying troops and supplies to and from Somalia during Operation Restore Hope from December 1992 until early 1994. In 1993, the FAA insured troop and cargo flights to Kuwait City in support of Operation Desert Caravan. In 1994, the FAA insured flights in support of Operation Provide Hope providing humanitarian relief supplies to the Republic of Georgia. Commonwealth of Independent States. In September and October 1994, the FAA insured flights into Haiti in support of Operation Uphold Democracy. In April 1996, the FAA began insuring troop rotation flights between Tuzla, Bosnia, and Germany. Prior to 1990, the last extensive use of FAA-issued insurance to cover commercial flight operations was in 1975. Since that time, commercial insurance industry practices evolved well beyond those prevailing in 1975 and earlier. The differences between coverage available from the commercial insurance industry and the coverage permitted under the Aviation Insurance Program's statutory authority has created insurance coverage gaps. The coverage gaps were highlighted by the partial activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) during Operations Desert Shield/Storm, the first activation since the program's inception. A majority of the civil air carriers providing the airlift for Operation Desert Shield/Storm had their commercial war risk insurance automatically canceled upon CRAF activation. As a result, the air carriers depended on FAA-issued insurance. The coverage gaps and the carriers' dependence on FAA-issued insurance caused Congress, the air carrier industry, and the FAA to review the aviation insurance program's statutory authority. Section 401(a) of Public Law 102\u00b1581 (October 31, 1992), expanded the FAA's authority to issue non- premium insurance coverage for domestic flight segments; for goods and services (i.e., spares support, refueling, etc.) in direct support of operations conducted under contract to the indemnifying agency; and for transport of military forces or materiel on behalf of the United States under an agreement between the Government and the government of a foreign country and forgoods and services in direct support thereof. The FAA further addressed coverage gaps by adopting new procedures and policies: e.g., the revision of the FAA's standard non- premium hull and liability policies and the development of endorsements to those policies to meet the specific insurance needs of DOD contract carriers. Additionally, the FAA is proposing, in this document, to provide insurance for all insurable interests consistent with current commercial aviation insurance practice. The Aviation Insurance Program has been used repeatedly over the last five years as the U.S. continues its involvement in international peacekeeping and humanitarian endeavors, and as DOD continues its reliance on civil aircraft. This continuing frequent use has significantly increased the administrative cost of maintaining the Aviation Insurance Program. In order to conform insurance program practices to changes in implementation authority, to improve program efficiency, and to offset incurred administration cost due to increased frequency of utilization of the Aviation Insurance Program, the FAA proposes the following amendments. Explanation of Proposed Changes In general, the FAA has broad discretion and judgment in determining the acceptable level of risk to be insured against under a given set of circumstances, and the policies and procedures to be followed in the administration of the insurance program. The proposals contained herein would not compromise this basic premise. Section 198.1 Section 198.1 would be published with editorial changes reflecting language used in the codification of the Federal Aviation Act. Section 198.1(b) would be revised to expand the operations covered under the Aviation Insurance Program. This proposed amendment would include, as eligible operations, those in domestic or foreign air commerce if non-premium insurance is sought. Section 198.3 Section 198.3(b) would be revised to expand the authority to cover flights operated pursuant to an agreement between the United States and a foreign government. A requirement for the airline to have a current copy of its commercial insurance policy on file would be added. In addition, this section would be changed to explainwhen insurance policies are actually in force and when they are in standby status. The section would be divided into paragraphs that clarify and correct the intent of the section. Section 198.5 Section 198.5 would be published with editorial changes reflecting language used in the codification of the Federal Aviation Act, and would clarify that any other insurable item may be insured if eligible for insurance under \u00a7 198.1. Section 198.7 Section 198.7 would be published with editorial changes reflecting language used in the codification of the Federal Aviation Act, and with the deletion of prior language requiring the approval of the agency on whose behalf contract air services are to be performed. Section 198.9 Section 198.9 would be revised to add flexibility for applicants applying for insurance. The FAA office administering the Aviation Insurance Program would provide guidance and necessary forms to apply for insurance. Appendix A would be removed. Also, a requirement that the applicant provide evidence of the unavailability of commercial insurance would be added. A provision that the standby non- premium policy only provides actual coverage when formally activated by the FAA has been included. Section 198.11 Section 198.11 would be revised to reflect editorial changes, and to include language relating to other insurable items. Section 198.13 Section 198.13 would be changed to reflect administrative payment procedures. The proposed language would provide generic instructions for greater flexibility of this section. Section 198.15 Section 198.15 would revise the current $200 binder for non-premium insurance, established in 1975, updating it for the inflation by the annual cumulative Consumer Price Index (CPI) rounded to the nearest $25. For example, using the latest annual cumulative CPI available, (2.760 for 1995), the binder would be $550 (calculation: $200 \u00d7 2.2760, rounded to the nearest $25) per aircraft or other insurable item. In the future, the binder amount would be adjusted annually for newly registered aircraft and other insurable items to reflect future19011 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Proposed Rules increases in the CPI, rounded to the nearest $25. The binder would continue to be a one-time charge, so that, once an aircraft operator registers an aircraft or other insurable item, no additional binder charge would be due while the operator continues to operate that aircraft or other insurable item. After publication of the final rule, the binder that is set forth in the final rule would be adjusted not more frequently than annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers (CPI) published by the Secretary of Labor. The adjusted binders would also be published in the ``Notice'' section in the Federal Register . This procedure would permit binder adjustments in a timely manner. However, in no event would an adjusted binder exceed the FAA's cost for providing a service. The adjusted binders would become effective in accordance with the notice which sets forth the adjusted binders. The increased binder would apply only to each insured carrier's aircraft and other insurable items registered after the effective date of the final rule. Section 198.15(d) would be added to state FAA's long standing policy that when an operator acquires an aircraft previously covered under another operator's policy, the new operator must register it in the same manner as an aircraft not previously covered. The insurance registrations are not transferable. Section 198.17 Section 198.17 would be revised to reflect the coverage of goods and services provided in direct support of aircraft operations as allowed now by law. Appendix A to Part 198\u00d0Form of Application to Section 198.9 Appendix A would be removed to simplify administration of the Aviation Insurance Program. The FAA office administering the program would provide forms upon request. Paperwork Reduction Act Information collection requirements in the proposed rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2120\u00b10514. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Joint Aviation Regulations (JAR) The FAA has determined that a review of the ICAO Standards andRecommended Practices and JAR's is not warranted because there are no existing comparable rules. Regulatory Evaluation Summary Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations or modify existing regulations only if the expected benefits to society outweigh the expected costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze the economic impact of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs agencies to assess the effect of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA has determined that this proposed rule: (1) Would generate benefits exceeding costs; (2) is not ``significant'' as defined in the Executive Order and DOT's Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) would not constitute a barrier to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below. Through the proposed changes, the FAA would attempt to recover some of the costs of providing current services from the beneficiaries of these services. The proposed rule would not impose additional costs on society. The cost of administering the insurance program in 1995 amounted to about $475,000. If the current $200 binder is updated, as proposed, by the latest annual Consumer Price Index (CPI), 1995, and adjusted to the nearest $25, the binder would be $550. This figure, multiplied by the number of aircraft newly registered each year, which is estimated at 80, yields $44,000. The increase is far less than the cost of administrating the program; it amounts to 9.3% of 1995 administrative costs. The FAA has determined that the proposed change in the binder for non-premium insurance, if implemented, is equitable. Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if a rule is expected to have a significant (positive or negative) economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Based on the standards and thresholds specified in FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, the FAA has determined thatthe proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act This proposed rule does not contain any Federal intergovernmental or private sector mandate. Therefore, the requirements of Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 does not apply. International Trade Impact The Office of Management and Budget directs agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. The proposed rule would not have any impact on international trade as the registration fee would be the same for all carriers, foreign as well as domestic. Federalism Implications The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12866, October 4, 1993, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion For the reasons discussed above, including the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation would not be significant under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, issued October 4, 1993. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal would not be considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) and Order DOT 2100.5, Policies and Procedures for Simplification, Analysis, and Review of Regulations, of May 22, 1980. An initial regulatory evaluation of the proposal, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and International Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket.

(a) Premium insurance may be made available if the requirements of \u00a7 198.1 are met. (b) Subject to \u00a7 198.9(c), standby insurance without premium may be made available if all of the following conditions are met: (1) A department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. Government seeks performance of air services operations, pursuant to a contract of the department, agency, or instrumentality; or transportation of military forces ormateriel on behalf of the United States, pursuant to an agreement between the United States and a foreign government. (2) Such department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. Government has agreed in writing to indemnify the Secretary of Transportation against all losses covered by such insurance. Such an agreement, when countersigned by the President constitutes a determination that the continuation of that aircraft operation is necessary to carry out the foreign policy of the United States. (3) A current copy of the aircraft operator's applicable commercial insurance policy or policies is on file with the FAA, including every endorsement making a material change to the policy. Updated copies of these policies must be provided upon each renewal of the commercial policy. Every subsequent material change by endorsement must be promptly provided to the FAA. (c) Insurance is activated, placing the insurance in full force, as specified by the FAA's written notification to the operator and remains in force until such time as either of the following occurs: (1) The requirements in \u00a7 198.1 are no longer met; or (2) In the case of non-premium insurance, an aircraft operation is no longer performed under contract to a department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. Government; or pursuant to an agreement between the United States and a foreign government.

(a) For each aircraft or insurable item, the amount insured may not exceed the amount for which the applicant has otherwise insured or self-insured the aircraft or insurable item against damage or liability arising from any risk. In the case of hull insurance, the amount insured may not exceed the reasonable value of the aircraft as determined by the FAA or its designated agent. (b) Policies issued without premium may be revised from time to time by the FAA with notice to the insured, to add aircraft or insurable items or to amend amounts of coverage if the insured has changed the amount by which it has otherwise insured or self-insured the aircraft or itself. \u00a7198.9 Application for insurance. (a) Application for premium or non- premium insurance must be made in accordance with the applicable form supplied by the FAA.

(c) Each applicant for premium or non-premium insurance must submit to the FAA evidence that commercial insurance is not available on reasonable terms for each flight or ground operation for which insurance is sought. Each aircraft operator who has a standby non- premium insurance policy must submit evidence to the FAA that commercial insurance is not available on reasonable terms before the FAA activates that policy. The adequacy of the evidence submitted is determined solely by the FAA. (d) The standby non-premium policy issued to the aircraft operator does not provide actual coverage until formally activated by the FAA. \u00a7198.11 Change in status of aircraft. In the event of sale, lease, confiscation, requisition, total loss, or other change in the status of an aircraft or insurable items covered by insurance under this part, the insured party must notify the office administering the Aviation Insurance Program within 10 working days after the change in status. \u00a7198.13 Premium insurance\u00d0payment of premiums.

Sections 502(d)(1) and 503(c)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended by Public Law 104-188; 110 Stat. 1755, 2462(d)(1) and 2463(c)(1)), provide that the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of the duty-free treatment accorded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) with respect to any country and any article upon consideration of the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)). Pursuant to sections 502(d)(1) and 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act and having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of such Act, including, in particular, section 502(c)(5) (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)(5)) on the extent to which a designated beneficiary developing country is providing adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights, I have determined that it is appropriate to suspend the duty-free treatment accorded under the GSP to certain eligible articles that are the product of Argentina, as provided in the Annex to this proclamation. 2. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J.

It is also an occasion for us to acknowledge our significant progress in securing crucial rights and services for crime victims. As we reflect on the events of this past year, we think of all our fellow citizens who became victims of crime on our streets, at home, in our neighbor- hoods, in our schools, in our workplaces, and even in our sacred places of worship. We remember the images of dozens of mostly African American churches being consumed in flames, and we recall church leaders and their congregations, representing all denominations and races, reaching out to invite healing and rebuilding\u00d0not in isolation, but in an extraordinary spirit of community and unity. We also remember the many contributions of crime victims in pioneering crime prevention programs in our schools and working to strengthen our laws and to enlighten all of us about the needs of all crime victims. Through the dedicated efforts of crime victims and their advocates, criminal justice workers, and responsive legislators, we have made important strides in the struggle against violence. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforce- ment Act of 1994 allocated an increase in resources for criminal justice programs, deploying thousands of new police officers on our streets. The Brady Bill has prevented over 225,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying handguns since it was enacted. And the Community Notification Act, known as ``Megan's Law,'' is helping us protect our most vulnerable citizens by informing communities of the presence of convicted pedophiles. With community notification, we are working to prevent cases like that of the Act's namesake, Megan Kanka, a 7 year-old who died at the hands of a repeat sex offender released into an unsuspecting community. With these and other preventive measures, we've managed to reduce the rate of violent crime for 5 straight years and to restore hope of reaching our goal of a peaceful America. We can also take heart in our efforts to assist victims in need of justice and healing in the aftermath of violent crimes. The Violence Against Women Act, a historic and comprehensive plan targeted at ending crimes against women, has provided much-needed services to countless domestic violence victims and their children. Likewise, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, established last year, has responded to more than 73,000 calls for assistance from around the country. As a result of over $500 million in deposits to the Federal Crime Victims Fund in fiscal 1996, the States will receive more than three times as much in Federal funds as they have received in any previous year to support local victim assistance programs. And the Antiterrorism Act has guaranteed restitution to victims of Federal crimes and mass violence; it has already provided substantial assistance to victims of the Oklahoma City bombing.19022 Federal Register /Vol. 62, No. 74 /Thursday, April 17, 1997 /Presidential Documents This year, we can take one more historic step to ensure that victims through- out our country are guaranteed the fundamental rights to be present at proceedings, to be informed of significant developments in their cases and of their rights, and to be heard at sentencing and other appropriate times throughout the criminal justice process. The Congress should pass a Victims' Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution that will, when ratified by the States, ensure that crime victims are at the center of the criminal justice process, not on the outside looking in. We must stand united in caring for and assisting crime victims throughout our country. NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J.
