With increased awareness, we can both notice and choose to relax those muscles that tend to hold habitual tension and stress. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is a deep relaxation technique used to control stress and anxiety, [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27555224/)- [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18518981/) help with sleep disturbances (fatigue and insomnia), [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27341675/) and reduce symptoms of certain types of chronic pain. [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27341675/), [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24965313/) Progressive muscle relaxation may be done in either a seated or lying position. Pillows or mats may be beneficial if you choose to lie down. Progressive Muscle Relaxation is a process in which systematically tensing and releasing your muscles enhances your ability to relax. It is an opportunity to become more aware of how we hold tension in our bodies that can lead to chronic pain or discomfort. You will move through the different muscle groups of your body and, by tightening and releasing, will be able to consciously bring more relaxation to each part. You can tighten and hold that tension for about 5 seconds, then relax and let it go. Holding your breath when you tighten your muscles and exhaling as you release them can be helpful. Be careful to tighten just enough to notice that the muscles are active and engaged, but not enough to be painful. We will be tightening and then relaxing each set of muscles twice. If you feel comfortable closing your eyes, go ahead and allow them to close now. If you'd rather leave them open, just hold a light, gentle gaze on a point about 3 to 5 feet in front of you. You'll now move into tensing and relaxing the muscles throughout the body. Tense your facial muscles by squinting your eyes, wrinkling your nose, bringing the corners of your mouth towards your ears, and tensing your jaw. Just letting the muscles go soft. Noticing what it feels like as these muscles become more and more relaxed.
