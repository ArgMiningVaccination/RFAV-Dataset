The Bio-Energy Therapy Protocol (BTP) exposes your body to four of Earth's natural elements: Magnetism. Oxygen. Red Light. Water. Without magnetism, oxygen, light and water we cannot survive. With them we are \"Superhuman\". The benefits to our health are compelling as the body responds beneficially to these therapies by creating more energy at the cellular level and interacting with the blood vessels, immune system and mitochondria - the power generator of the human cell. BIO-ENERGY THERAPY Protocol - FOUR Elements The combination of therapies leads to a chain reaction and creates an abundance of benefits for the body including: Stimulation of the production of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). Typically, mitochondria convert food molecules into energy in the form of ATP. Red light boosts this performance, allowing cells to function more optimally, replicate successfully, and fight any infections. Increase in the creation of new capillaries. Creating more capillaries improves blood flow throughout the body, which helps to bring nutrients to cells and remove cell-damaging (and potentially toxic) waste. Reduction of cell apoptosis (a form of cell death) and improvement of cell proliferation and migration. Reduction of apoptosis means that more cells are available to \"educate\" immune cells in the thymus and the bone marrow, in effect teaching them to differentiate between the \"self\" and foreign bodies. Improvement of thyroid health. The thyroid hormones, specifically T(3) and T(4), are modulators of the immune response. Hypo- and hyperthyroid disorders adversely affect the activity of macrophages, leukocytes, natural killer cells, and lymphocytes; restoring normal thyroid activity will positively affect the activity of these immune cells. Improvement in liver regeneration. Stimulates liver regeneration, enabling the liver to \"sort\" nutrients and toxins and determine which should be absorbed or eliminated. Stimulation of the lymphatic system, which is critical for a strong immune system. Activation of stem cells which are then mobilized to become active in the immune response. Decreased inflammation, which is a leading cause of autoimmune diseases and many chronic illnesses. Increased melatonin production to promote restful sleep. Better mood (depression, anxiety, and stress have been linked with low immune responses). "}
