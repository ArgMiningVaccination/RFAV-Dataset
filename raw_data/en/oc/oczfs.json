COVID-19 Vaccine Effective May 15, 2023, Syracuse University students, faculty and staff are no longer required to be vaccinated for the virus that causes COVID-19. This includes new students, faculty and staff, who will not be required to demonstrate proof of vaccination as a condition of attendance or employment. Flu Vaccine Requirements The Barnes Center at The Arch strongly encourages all students to get the flu vaccine. Vaccination continues to be the best protection against illness and obtaining the flu vaccine helps our community reduce the impact of respiratory illness and make early diagnoses of COVID-19 more likely. The University will be making flu shots available on campus through a series of flu clinics open to all students. Vaccine clinics at the [Barnes Center at The Arch](https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/staysafe/#s:flu-shot-information) for students will be announced during the fall 2022 semester. Please bring your SU I.D. card and wear a face mask when you visit the flu clinic. Students must also bring their pharmacy benefit card and health insurance card, as the flu shot will be billed to their insurance. Most health insurance companies cover the cost of a flu vaccine in full. Students who have a copay or medical charge applied will be billed accordingly. Please know ability to pay will not impact your access to services. Students actively enrolled in the Syracuse University Student Health Insurance Plan do not need to bring their insurance information. Please note, your flu vaccine must have been received after Aug. 1, 2022. Students: If you receive your flu vaccine through another medical provider or at a pharmacy, you can upload your proof of vaccination to the Patient Portal using the following directions: - Log into the [Patient Portal](https://shibidp.syr.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO?execution=e1s2)with your SU email and password. (You will be prompted to complete Microsoft's Multi-factor Authentication in advance of accessing the Patient Portal if you have not done so previously.) - Select \"Upload\" on the main menu. - Follow the upload instructions - Select \"Flu Vaccine Documentation\" from the drop-down. - Add your proof of vaccination. Students with religious or medical exemptions: Visit the [Patient Portal](http://suhsportal.syr.edu/) to download the Medical-Religious Waiver. Once completed, submit your waiver via the \"Upload\" option in the Patient Portal. Students who already have a medical or religious exemption on file for flu do not need to take any further action. COVID Testing The University is no longer operating an on-campus testing operations center for asymptomatic individuals. Symptomatic students in need of COVID testing services can make an appointment at the Barnes Center by calling 315.443.8000. Faculty and staff requiring a COVID test are encouraged to utilize a community provider, your primary care physician or an at-home COVID test. At-home tests are available at a highly-subsidized cost in dedicated vending machines located across campus. Visit the [COVID Testing page](https://www.syracuse.edu/staysafe/get-tested/) for locations. At-home tests are also available through the Barnes Center pharmacy and may be covered by your insurance carrier. Although the test packaging indicates a \"use by\" date of July 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended their use-by date to January 2023. Specifically, on [July 8, 2022, the FDA granted an extension](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0428/9406/5826/files/02_-_EUA210470.S010_iHealth_Letter_Granting_EUA_Revision_07-08-2022.pdf?v=1657835428) for the iHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test, which extended the shelf-life of these tests. You can also check the status of the use-by date of your specific tests by visiting [https://ihealthlabs.com/pages/news](https://ihealthlabs.com/pages/news) and entering the lot number found on the test packaging. Students can report a positive COVID-19 test result by visiting the Barnes Center's [Reporting a COVID-19 Test Result](https://experience.syracuse.edu/bewell/covid-19-positive-test-result/) page and following the instructions. Isolation To learn more about isolation protocols, please visit the [Stay Safe COVID-19 Response Checklists](https://www.syracuse.edu/staysafe/covid-19-response-checklists/) webpage. Syracuse University students who test positive for COVID will isolate in place in their residence hall, South Campus apartment or off-campus residence. Students may also choose to isolate at home. All students will be required to isolate for up to 5 full days. If asymptomatic or symptoms are improving, on the morning of day 6 students will follow modified isolation guidelines through day 10. The Barnes Center at The Arch will provide guidelines to the student's syr.edu email account. To learn more about isolation protocols, please visit the [Stay Safe COVID-19 Response Checklists](https://www.syracuse.edu/staysafe/covid-19-response-checklists/) webpage. Students with a meal plan can visit the dining hall to pick up food in a to-go container and eat back in their room or, if not feeling well enough to go to the dining hall, can request a Feel Better Food Pack to be delivered to the front desk of your residence hall. Students without a meal plan should plan to use their typical resources, such as having groceries or meals delivered by a delivery service, or asking friends/roommates to pick up food. Financial Assistance The pandemic has created financial hardship for many in our community. Please know there may be financial assistance available. - Please review [information about emergency funding](https://maestro.syr.edu/trk/click?ref=zvu694kig_0-3af7x37b7dx0kmhale02%40syr.edu&)and complete the [financial appeal for U.S. citizens/permanent residents](https://maestro.syr.edu/trk/click?ref=zvu694kig_0-3af7x37b7ex0kmhale02%40syr.edu&)or [financial appeal for international students](https://maestro.syr.edu/trk/click?ref=zvu694kig_0-3af7x37b7fx0kmhale02%40syr.edu&)to apply. - These requests will be reviewed quickly. Decisions are based on financial need and/or hardship. Facilities Considerations The University has already built out the infrastructure to comply with all Centers for Disease Control (CDC)-mandated cleaning and sanitation protocols, including increased cleaning of public spaces, bathrooms, HVAC systems and other components. Specifically, these include enhanced cleaning and sanitation of classrooms, laboratories, studios and performance venues, libraries, residence halls, dining halls, recreation spaces, gathering spaces and other high-traffic areas. The University utilizes disinfectants that have been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as appropriate to eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus (cause of COVID-19). For information on cleaning and disinfecting efforts in work areas, please visit [ehss.syr.edu/about/covid-19-information/work-area-cleaning-and-disinfecting/](https://ehss.syr.edu/about/covid-19-information/work-area-cleaning-and-disinfecting/) Localized cleaning devices may be used, but any localized air cleaning or purification device brought onto campus for individual use must meet the following criteria: - Device must be UL or ETL listed and able to be plugged into a standard 115 V outlet. - Device must be mechanical filtration device (device with removable/replaceable filters) with an AHAM rating. - Devices relying on electrical fields/ions/sorbents/photocatalytic oxidation are not acceptable due to inconsistent data on effectiveness and must not be used. - Ozone generating devices are unacceptable due to negative health effects and must not be used. The individual or department procuring and bringing the device onto campus will be responsible for maintaining the device. For Faculty and Instructors Each classroom and department has been supplied with cleaning products so that students and faculty can sanitize their areas (desk or podium) when they arrive in the classroom. Hand sanitizing stations and disinfectant wipes are available immediately outside the classrooms and technology sanitizing supplies are available near the teaching areas. Departments, schools and colleges can continue to request these supplies using the [COVID-19 Supply Request Form](https://maestro.syr.edu/trk/click?ref=zvu694kig_1-4c39x3b487x085789&). The requested supplies will be delivered directly to you, generally within 24 hours of the request. The items available include, but are not limited to, cloth and disposable masks, Clorox wipes, sanitizing wipes, disinfectant spray and hand sanitizers. These supplies continue to be provided at no cost to you for use on campus. For more information on COVID-19 supplies, please contact Environmental Health and Safety Services (EHSS) at EHSS@syr.edu. We have reviewed the ventilation system for each classroom on campus. Each classroom is unique and we have implemented the most viable strategies to safely manage the ventilation in each building. The ventilation strategies include: - Installing MERV 13 or higher filters whenever possible in building air handlers using return air from occupied spaces. - Increasing outdoor air ventilation rates where possible and when outdoor air conditions are favorable. - Deploying mobile combination UV-C and/or HEPA air cleaning systems in classrooms that have reduced air flow. If you have specific concerns regarding the operation or maintenance of the HVAC system please contact your Building Supervisor. Instructors with one or more students who cannot attend class due to COVID-related restrictions are required to assist those students so that they can resume participation in the class when their absence ends. Instructors are not required to provide remote instruction (hybrid participation) to these students, though they can if they want to. Instructors can record their classes if they wish, or they can provide course materials, assignments, etc. via e-mail and periodically check in with the students. Requirements for isolation have changed. Please review the updated [COVID-19 Response Checklists](http://www.syracuse.edu/staysafe/covid-19-response-checklists/). If you cannot teach due to illness or isolation, you should make arrangements for continuity in your course as you would for any health issue. This may include, but is not limited to, teaching remotely, finding a substitute to meet class, inviting a guest speaker relevant to the course, or arranging alternative activities for students - faculty are best positioned to know what course of action is most appropriate for their courses and students. Faculty who cannot teach in person because of isolation requirements may teach their courses online if they feel well enough. If they don't feel well enough to teach, then deans and department chairs should employ the approaches they have always used when faculty "}
