Let us help you create a healthier medicine cabinet for yourself and the planet by choosing these natural, reusable and sustainable alternatives for your aches, pains and daily care needs. Natural Pain Relief We often turn to over-the-counter pills when we are in pain from headaches, sore muscles or painful joints, but natural alternatives may be equally effective and safer. Try these on for size. Relieve Muscle and Arthritic Pain Arnica: Available in creams and tablets, arnica relieves osteoarthritic pain in the knee and pain following carpal-tunnel release surgery. It contains helenin, an analgesic, as well as anti-inflammatory chemicals. Apply cream twice daily; use tablets according to package directions. Devil's claw: A South African herb with medicinally active roots, devil's claw can ease muscular tension or pain in the back, shoulders and neck, and is a popular treatment for osteoarthritic pain. It may also ease rheumatoid arthritic pain after about two months of use. Devil's claw extract is considered safe at the typical dosage of 750 mg (containing 3 percent iridoid glycosides) taken three times daily. It is also available as tincture (use 1 teaspoon up to three times daily) and tea. It should not be taken with blood-thinning medications and may not be safe during pregnancy or for young children, nursing mothers and individuals with liver or kidney disease, or digestive system ulcers. Capsaicin: The heat element in hot peppers, capsaicin manipulates the body's pain status by hindering pain perception, triggering the release of pain-relieving endorphins and providing analgesic action. Commercial capsaicin creams such as Zostrix, Heet and Capzasin-P are used topically for arthritic and nerve pain. Creams containing .025 percent capsaicin can significantly reduce osteoarthritic pain when applied to joints four times daily. A higher concentration of .075 percent works best for peripheral nerve pain\u2014such as that from diabetic nerve damage, HIV and pain following cancer surgery. When using topical capsaicin products, be sure to avoid touching your eyes and other sensitive areas. Gamma-linolenic acid: GLA may help the body produce the prostaglandins and leukotrienes (hormonelike substances) that can reduce inflammation. It curbs rheumatoid arthritic pain, relieving morning stiffness and joint tenderness. Some evidence indicates GLA also can help migraine headaches and mild diabetic nerve damage. Borage and black currant seed oils are the richest sources of GLA. The recommended daily dose for rheumatoid arthritis is 1 to 3 grams GLA supplement, and for mild diabetic neuropathy, 400 to 600 mg daily. GLA may take up to six months for significant relief. Note: Long-term use may lead to inflammation, blood clots or decreased immune system functioning. Natural Headache Relief 5-hydroxytryptophan: 5-HTP is an amino acid our bodies create and then turn into serotonin. Many headache drugs work by affecting serotonin, and preliminary research shows that taking 5-HTP might help prevent migraine and tension headaches. Serotonin affects circulation in the brain and can help increase levels of endorphins\u2014our bodies' natural painkillers. Take 50 to 100 mg three times daily. Don't combine 5-HTP with antidepressant or anti-anxiety medications. Feverfew: Many sufferers swear by feverfew for headaches, including migraines. Feverfew can reduce both the frequency and severity of headaches when taken regularly. It is available in 60-mg capsules of fresh, powdered leaf (1 to 6 capsules daily), or 25-mg capsules of freeze-dried leaf (2 capsules daily). You can also make tea\u2014steep 2 to 8 fresh leaves in boiling water, but do not boil them, as boiling breaks down the active parthenolides. Magnesium: Magnesium can be relaxing to the nervous system and can help relieve migraine headaches and prevent tension headaches. While you can take 200 mg of magnesium two to three times daily, magnesium is best absorbed through the skin, so consider taking an Epsom salt bath for headaches that won't go away. White willow bark: One of the oldest home analgesics, willow bark contains salicin, the key ingredient in aspirin, which makes it a natural pain reliever. Willow bark doesn't work as fast as ibuprofen, but it's also less likely to cause the gastrointestinal bleeding that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are famous for. Purchase willow bark as a standardized extract or tea and follow package dosing instructions. Note: Willow should not be given to children, nor used by individuals with aspirin allergies, bleeding disorders, or liver or kidney disease. Willow may interact adversely with blood-thinning medications and other anti-inflammatory drugs. Also, willow tends not to irritate the stomach in the short term, but long-term use can be problematic. First Aid When minor cuts, burns or bruises befall the members of your family, turn to these time-tested treatments. Aloe vera gel: Cooling and healing, aloe vera soothes the inflammation of sunburn and minor kitchen scalds and burns. Keep a fresh plant in the kitchen and, when needed, cut a stalk and squeeze gel from it. Or buy 100 percent pure aloe vera gel. Calendula salve: The antifungal, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties. Apply it as needed to any minor skin irritation including diaper rash, blisters, minor scrapes and more. Goldenseal capsules or powder: A powerful antimicrobial, goldenseal is effective against a variety of microorganisms that cause traveler's diarrhea. The powder has antiseptic properties and can be sprinkled onto minor cuts or wounds to stop bleeding (it stings, but is very effective). Do not take goldenseal internally during pregnancy. Grindelia poison oak/ivy tincture or spray: Grindelia, also known as gumweed, contains resins and tannins that help to relieve the pain and itching of plant rashes. It's commercially available as a tincture and also as a spray specifically for treating poison oak/ivy rashes. Witch hazel extract: Distilled witch hazel has mild astringent, antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, making it useful for insect bites and skin irritations. It's also an excellent base for diluting essential oils for a variety of simple, topical herbal first-aid remedies. Do not take it internally. Tummy Troubles Stomachaches can knock the fun out of any day. When you're facing indigestion or digestive cramps, try these methods of natural relief. Fennel: Fennel seeds are stocked with 16 analgesic and 27 antispasmodic chemicals. It makes a pleasant licorice-flavored tea and is especially good for menstrual cramps. Avoid the herb while pregnant or nursing because of its estrogenic effects. Ginger: Ginger's analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties can help alleviate digestive cramps, indigestion and mild pain from fibromyalgia. Take 1 to 4 grams powdered ginger daily, divided into two to four doses, or make tea from 1 teaspoon chopped fresh root simmered in a cup of water for about 10 minutes. Peppermint: A famous antispasmodic for digestive cramps, peppermint essential oil is also used as a local topical anesthetic in commercial ointments such as Solarcaine and Ben-Gay. Germany's Commission E recommends oral peppermint oil for digestive issues in adults. Several double-blind studies of individuals with irritable bowel syndrome demonstrate peppermint can significantly relieve painful abdominal cramps, bloating and flatulence. Take a 0.2- to 0.4-ml enteric-coated peppermint capsule three times daily; enteric coating prevents stomach upset. For mild stomach discomfort, try a tea from fresh or dried peppermint leaves.

Better Dental Care Have you ever wondered what makes your toothpaste green, sweet and minty-fresh? Most conventional toothpastes contain petrochemicals and hormone-disrupting chemicals such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and triclosan, as well as artificial sweeteners such as saccharin (made with chlorine, ammonia and other noxious chemicals). They also often include synthetic dyes, many of which are derived from coal tar\u2014a known human carcinogen. (Look for the words \"colorant,\" \"blue or any \"lake,\" \"yellow No. 1,\" \"D&C\" and \"FD&C\" on labels.) For naturally refreshing alternatives, seek out products made with herbs such as neem, parsley, clove and tea tree, and sweetened with stevia or fruit and herb extracts.
