However, naturopathic medicine is a distinct system of primary health care, distinguished by the healing principles upon which its practice is based.

Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic physicians see each person as a unique individual and treat each patient by taking into account their particular physical, mental, emotional, environmental, social, spiritual and other aspects of health. Identify and Treat the Cause(s): Naturopathic physicians seek to identify and remove the underlying cause(s) of illness, rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm: Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: - Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; - Avoid the harmful suppression of symptoms whenever possible; - Acknowledge, respect and work with the individual's self-healing process. Doctor as Teacher:Naturopathic physicians educate their patients, encourage self-responsibility for health and recognize the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Prevention: Naturopathic physicians emphasize the prevention of disease, assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease and making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Naturopathic Doctors Are Trained As Primary Health Care Practitioners Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary health care practitioners, and as such treat a broad range of health conditions. Founded upon a holistic philosophy, naturopathic medicine combines safe and effective traditional therapies with the most current scientific advances in modern medicine. For many diseases and conditions (a few examples: ulcerative colitis, asthma, menopause, flu, obesity, chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety), treatments used by naturopathic physicians can be primary and even curative. Naturopathic physicians also function within an integrated framework; for example, referring patients to an appropriate medical specialist, such as an oncologist or a surgeon. And within the context of specialized care, naturopathic therapies can complement the treatments used by conventionally trained medical doctors. The result is a team-care approach that recognizes the needs of the patient to receive the best overall treatment most appropriate to his or her specific medical condition. The goal of a naturopathic doctor is to employ therapies that support and promote the body's natural healing process, leading to the highest state of wellness. Education of a Naturopath A Naturopathic doctor (N.D.) is the highest trained practitioner in the broadest scope of natural holistic treatments. In addition to the basic medical sciences and conventional diagnostics, naturopathic education includes therapeutic nutrition, botanical / herbal medicine, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, naturopathic manipulative therapy, counseling, mind/body medicine, and pharmacology. Naturopathic physicians are trained as primary health care practitioners, whose diverse techniques include modern and traditional, scientific and empirical methods. A licensed naturopathic doctor (N.D.) attends a five-year graduate-level naturopathic medical school and is educated in all of the same basic sciences as an M.D., in addition to studies of the holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with a strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. Contemporary Naturopathic Doctors, such as Dr. DiRoma, Dr. Boulter, and Dr. Burrell, who have attended an accredited naturopathic medical school, recognized by the US Department of Education, practice medicine as primary health care providers and are increasingly acknowledged as leaders in bringing about progressive changes in the nation's medical system. Naturopathic Treatments In accordance with their training, modern American naturopathic doctors use therapies that are primarily natural (hence the name naturopathic) and nontoxic. These therapies include, but are not limited to, the following: - Clinical nutrition - Homeopathy - Botanical medicine - Hydrotherapy - Physical medicine - Detox/cleanse protocols - Mind/body medicine - Counseling Our Special Team Approach to Your Health Care Unique to the Center's medical practice, our naturopathic doctors , offer full comprehensive evaluations in collaboration with Dr. Ronald Stram, M.D. These practitioners utilize a team approach to the care of their patients, and develop customized treatment plans, taking into account the benefits of the best combination of therapies available.
