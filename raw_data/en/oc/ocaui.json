Anti-aging medicine applies advanced science and medical technology to early detection, prevention, treatment, and reversal of age-related dysfunctions, disorders, and diseases. Therefore, anti-aging diagnostic medicine and healthcare are important factors in helping the elderly population lead healthy and active lives. However, it is challenging to diagnose various aging and related diseases accurately through various forms of anti-aging diagnostic medicine and health management. It may not be treated appropriately, so many older people are making various efforts to prevent aging themselves in advance. Therefore, anti-aging medicine and health care have been developed in various forms, from health checkups to alternative medicine and biophysical technology beyond simple clinical medicine, and are being applied to demand the needs of the elderly. This review intends to explore and characterize various applications related to anti-aging medicine and healthcare in the elderly. In addition, economic, medical, and ethical considerations arising from the relationship between the increase in the elderly population and the continuous development of anti-aging medicine can be considered.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-03-26", "cleaned_text": "Insights into the Anti-Aging Prevention and Diagnostic Medicine and Healthcare [https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12040819](https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12040819) [Exploring At the biological level, aging is caused by accumulating various molecular and cellular damages over time. Accumulation of the development of cell degeneration may ultimately lead to death by diminished physical and mental capacity, induction of illness, and increased risk [ [3](#B3-diagnostics-12-00819), [4](#B4-diagnostics-12-00819), [5](#B5-diagnostics-12-00819)]. The cell degeneration effects can be explained by various factors and can be classified as follows: Internal factors are cell changes due to inflammation, hormone deficiency, and external factors are smoking, drinking, and inappropriate intake of nutrients. Therefore, aging reflects the biological reality of cells due to the effects of various factors on the body and has an inherent dynamism that cannot be controlled. [6](#B6-diagnostics-12-00819), [7](#B7-diagnostics-12-00819), [8](#B8-diagnostics-12-00819), [9](#B9-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Anti-aging focuses on technical aspects that can delay, prevent, or reverse the aging process in the scientific community. In the medical community, anti-aging means early detection, prevention, and treatment of age-related diseases. It is different from the point of view of the scientific community that deals with the aging process itself, and various strategies and treatment methods can be used. Although it is interpreted as research and clinical approaches to anti-aging from a slightly different point of view, it has the same character as the ultimate aim of maintaining physical and mental health. [6](#B6-diagnostics-12-00819), [7](#B7-diagnostics-12-00819), [10](#B10-diagnostics-12-00819), [11](#B11-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Anti-aging medicine contributes to prolonging healthy life and reducing the chances of developing various age-related diseases, including intervening in the biological process of aging. In general, health-related policies focus on treatment after the onset of disease under the universal medical system, but there is a disadvantage of causing an increase in medical expenses. Therefore, the importance of medicine for various preventive approaches\u2014namely, preventive medicine\u2014is now emerging, and the paradigm of medical and health-related policies is changing. Anti-aging medicine, which focuses on aging, is also approached in various ways for preventive purposes, so besides playing a central role in the field of preventive medicine, it can also have a significant impact on improving the quality of life through life extension [ [6](#B6-diagnostics-12-00819), [12](#B12-diagnostics-12-00819), [13](#B13-diagnostics-12-00819), [14](#B14-diagnostics-12-00819), [ [5](#B5-diagnostics-12-00819)], decreased immunity [ [8](#B8-diagnostics-12-00819)], and changes in hormone levels [ [17](#B17-diagnostics-12-00819)] can affect aging, there are still some controversial aspects in terms of the results. As such, anti-aging medicine has been developing in various forms so far, pursuing biophysical and functional improvement of aging phenomena in our lives under the great goal of extending human lifespan and improving quality of life. This review explores different approaches and characteristics of anti-aging medicine and addresses the paradigms and future developments of technological developments in anti-aging medicine. 2. Methods 3. Results [Figure 1](#diagnostics-12-00819-f001). 3.1. Anti-Aging Related Health Checkup [18](#B18-diagnostics-12-00819)], sensory function, and the balance of free radicals and antioxidant potential, in addition to the existing general comprehensive health checkup [ [19](#B19-diagnostics-12-00819), [20](#B20-diagnostics-12-00819)]. It is also a way to detect and deal with signs of physical and mental aging at an early stage [ [21](#B21-diagnostics-12-00819)]. These examinations make it possible to provide early detection and treatment to prevent aging-related diseases that can occur physically and mentally and guide lifestyle habits such as taking nutritional supplements, exercise programs, and stress control. 3.2. Caloric Restriction [22](#B22-diagnostics-12-00819), [23](#B23-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Although there are no conclusive studies that CR may cause anti-aging effects in humans, some results have suggested that it may benefit specific groups of people [ [24](#B24-diagnostics-12-00819), [25](#B25-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Fontana et al. found that CR had a protective effect on human atherosclerosis, and other studies reported beneficial effects on cardiac function [ [26](#B26-diagnostics-12-00819)]. CR can also improve memory in the elderly. In addition, Racette et al. found some benefits of CR for reducing body weight and obesity, although similar to those obtained with exercise, it suggests that CR has a beneficial effect on some biomarkers for longevity in overweight individuals [ [27](#B27-diagnostics-12-00819), [28](#B28-diagnostics-12-00819)]. However, side effects due to CR have also been reported. Mental stress caused by being hungry and the resulting depression and loss of libido are its representative effects [ [29](#B29-diagnostics-12-00819)]. 3.3. Hormone Therapy [30](#B30-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Growth hormone has a long history as an anti-aging agent, and some evidence suggests that growth hormone has beneficial effects in older people [ [31](#B31-diagnostics-12-00819), [32](#B32-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Growth hormone supplements can increase muscle mass, strengthen the immune system, and increase libido [ [33](#B33-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Previous studies have shown that using human growth hormone as an anti-aging treatment in older adults indicated that the risks of growth hormone far outweigh the benefits [ [34](#B34-diagnostics-12-00819), [35](#B35-diagnostics-12-00819)]. The drawbacks of using growth hormone are the occurrence of soft tissue edema and the potential possibility to stimulate the growth of cancer cells due to the effects of hormone growth stimulation [ [36](#B36-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Insulin-like growth factor 1 [40](#B40-diagnostics-12-00819), [41](#B41-diagnostics-12-00819)] are hormones whose production declines with age. Many studies have been performed on these types of hormones that can contribute to the prevention of aging. In addition, as regards the side effects, the occurrence of acne was reported, and one study in older women found no evidence of benefits from DHEA [ [38](#B38-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Although many studies have been performed on the preclinical side and have pointed out that it can help reduce aging-related diseases and extend lifespan, the lack of clear evidence for the roles of these hormones in humans anti-aging and occurrences of side effects in humans indicate that the use of hormones is not yet sufficient. 3.4. Antioxidants [42](#B42-diagnostics-12-00819), [43](#B43-diagnostics-12-00819)], including vitamin E, vitamin C [ [44](#B44-diagnostics-12-00819), [45](#B45-diagnostics-12-00819)], and beta-carotene, is associated with a reduced risk of atherosclerosis-related diseases. Moreover, the effects of vitamin E on patients with Alzheimer's disease showed significant differences in both antioxidant and cognitive function improvement abilities [ [43](#B43-diagnostics-12-00819)]. On the other hand, a randomized controlled trial of more than 35,000 healthy women over 45 years of age did not show any beneficial effects of vitamin E in preventing major cardiovascular events [ [45](#B45-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Although these antioxidants affect certain age-related diseases and medical advances for antiaging are being pursued, it is also necessary to recognize that the results are hard to generalize to the entire range of aging, and many researchers agree that continuous follow-up studies are necessary. 3.5. Stem Cell [46](#B46-diagnostics-12-00819)]. However, although the depletion and dysfunction of stem cells are thought to play a role in aging [ [47](#B47-diagnostics-12-00819), [48](#B48-diagnostics-12-00819)], it is still hard to mention that stem cell-based anti-aging treatments are effective because harvesting and/or preparing stem cells for treatment is complicated, and scientific research still remains to optimize the protocol. Nevertheless, in some parts, stem cells have been shown to be useful, such as blood and bone marrow-derived stem cells used in some autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases [ [49](#B49-diagnostics-12-00819)]. However, stem cell applications are still in the early stage and still far from allowing physicians and doctors to use stem cells to delay aging. 3.6. Alternative Medicine [50](#B50-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Since alternative medicine is rarely taught as part of traditional medical school education systems, it often does not meet the mainstream medical community and standards [ [51](#B51-diagnostics-12-00819), [52](#B52-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Nevertheless, in 1993, Eisenberg et al. pointed out that 43% of Americans use certain forms of alternative medicine, such as chiropractic, massage, and relaxation therapy [ [49](#B49-diagnostics-12-00819)]. In particular, many previous studies have reported that alternative medicine in the elderly is much higher [ [53](#B53-diagnostics-12-00819), [54](#B54-diagnostics-12-00819), [55](#B55-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Notably, the therapeutic form of alternative medicine appears differently depending on the ethnic background. Asians are more likely to receive acupuncture, whereas Hispanics are more likely to receive dietary supplements, and Caucasians are more likely to receive chiropractic care [ [56](#B56-diagnostics-12-00819), [57](#B57-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Alternative medicine, sometimes referred to as Chinese medicine or oriental medicine, is commonly referred to as complementary and alternative medicine, which refers to a more collaborative than an adversarial relationship with conventional medical practice. [58](#B58-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Massage stimulates the skin, muscles, and nervous system to induce relaxation and reduce stress. Each type of massage gives a unique pressure, friction, repetitive force, and stroke pattern. Although chiropractic and massage have not demonstrated significant advantages over physical therapy and other medical treatment methods, they are mainly used by the elderly due to their ease of access and simple concept of exercise treatment. [59](#B59-diagnostics-12-00819)]. However, it is difficult to secure the homogeneity of several acupuncture-related studies. The outcome effect of acupuncture is still controversial to provide clear evidence in its application, such as mixed results in each analysis, except that one study clearly showed clinical improvement [ [60](#B60-diagnostics-12-00819)]. Although it is currently accepted by Western medical practitioners and practiced by some pain management physicians in the United States, it still remains challenging to provide a clear scientific or clinical basis for treatment. 4. Discussion [61](#B61-diagnostics-12-00819)]. In addition, the United Nations (UN) report, which is related to the probabilistic prediction of the increase in the population aged 60 and over by continent, indicates that the aging population can continue to increase by about 2.5 times from 2020 to 2070 ( [Figure 2](#diagnostics-12-00819-f002)) [ [62](#B62-diagnostics-12-00819)]. [63](#B63-diagnostics-12-00819)]. These include slim body maintenance, smoking cessation, regular exercise, active social and sexual life maintenance, sustained psychostimulation, stress avoidance, healthy eating, and moderateness, emphasizing several widely recommended interventions to maintain the health of the elderly, such as a healthy diet. A4M argues that these interventions lead to antiaging and can also extend the human lifespan. In addition, with continued scientific developments such as nanotechnology and stem cell therapy, it is predicted that humanity will evolve into an ageless society in which we all experience endless physical and mental vitality. [64](#B64-diagnostics-12-00819), [65](#B65-diagnostics-12-00819)]. It is possible to have critical perspectives on the commercialization of technology for life extension and the social problems of overpopulation caused by antiaging medicine. Moreover, from the opposite point of view, some researchers highlight the positive perspectives of anti-aging\u2014namely, antiaging medicine can potentially reduce the incidence of many diseases and enable a healthy life. Therefore, it is necessary to reflect critically on the socioeconomic issues and the particular problem of the antiaging medicine market and consider the issues of inequality that may arise from these issues. Ultimately, this is an important aspect that requires continuous reflection on the legitimacy and process of medicine based on a scientific approach to solving the problem of aging. 5.
