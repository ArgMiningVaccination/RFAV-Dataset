Last updated on Jul 14, 2023. Clinical Overview Use The whole Ephedra sinica plant has traditionally been used to treat symptoms of bronchial asthma, colds, influenza, allergies, and hives in teas or tinctures. Because of adverse events and lack of efficacy, use is not recommended for weight loss or increased athletic performance. Ephedra-containing supplements are banned for sale in the United States. Dosing Ephedra-containing dietary supplements are currently banned in the United States. Dosages of ephedra more than 32 mg/day have resulted in adverse reactions. Contraindications Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events have been documented in case reports. Pregnancy/Lactation Documented adverse reactions. Avoid use. Interactions Interactions are likely to be similar to those established for synthetic ephedrine and include monoamine oxidase inhibitors antidepressants, caffeine, theophylline, and steroids such as dexamethasone. Adverse Reactions Reported adverse reactions include arrhythmia and sudden death, myocardial infarction, stroke, psychiatric symptoms, autonomic hyperactivity, seizures, and ischemic colitis and gastric mucosal injury. Toxicology Toxicological data are limited. Periconceptional use of ephedra-containing products has been associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio for anencephaly. Scientific Family - Ephedraceae (ephedra) Botany Ephedra species grow as low, shrubby plants with small leaves on jointed, ribbed green stems. They are dioecious (ie, male and female flowers are usually found on separate plants). The 3-source species are native to China, where the aboveground parts are collected in the fall and dried for use. Ephedras are gymnosperms and are most closely related to conifers, although many aspects of their botany are different. About 45 Ephedra species exist, varying in their alkaloid content. American, Chilean, and European species are considered to be relatively low in alkaloid content, while Chinese and Indian varieties contain larger amounts of active alkaloids. The root of E. sinica or E. intermedia, known as \"ma huang gen,\" is considered by Chinese traditional practitioners to be a distinct drug product from the aboveground parts. A chapter on ephedra has been included in the Flora of China, a huang is one of the earliest and best known drugs of Chinese traditional medicine. It is mentioned in the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing, one of the premodern classics of Chinese medicine written around 100 AD. Ma huang was used to induce perspiration and treat the symptoms of bronchial asthma, colds, and influenza; it is still in traditional use today. The earliest scientific work on ephedra, and consequently on ephedrine, is attributed to the Japanese organic chemist and pharmacologist Nagayoshi Nagai (1844 to 1929), followed by his colleague Kinnosuke Miura (1864 to 1950), who identified the potential toxicity of the alkaloids. As a weight loss agent, ephedra has been commonly combined with caffeine; however, more recently the ephedra component has been replaced with bitter orange in US dietary supplements. [Lee 2011](#21365072), [Fu 2000](#Fu.2000) Chemistry Chemical investigations of ephedra in the early 20th century resulted in the isolation of the alkaloids ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which were identified as the major pharmacologically active compounds in the aboveground portions of the plant. The ephedra alkaloids possess 2 adjacent chiral atoms that could generate 4 possible isomers for every planar structure; however, the plant produces only 2 of the possible isomers. [Freudenberg 1932](#Freudenberg.1932) Synthetic ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are usually produced as a racemate, and therefore contain all of the possible isomers. A total of 6 major alkaloids of this type are found in the 3 species known as Ephedrae herba; the major alkaloid of all species is ephedrine, with pseudoephedrine the next most abundant, and norephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, methylephedrine, and methylpseudoephedrine making up the balance. [Jian 1988](#17265209) The proportion of single alkaloids and total alkaloid content of the aboveground portions can vary widely, from 0.5% to 2.5%, with the highest concentration of alkaloids found in the fall. Biosynthesis of ephedra alkaloids has been studied; 1994](#Grue-Srensen.1994) The supercritical fluid extraction of ephedrine from E. sinica has been studied using a mixture of carbon dioxide, diethylamine, and methanol. [Choi 1999](#Choi.1999) A large number of analytical methods for ephedra alkaloids have been devised. Gas chromatography has been used, as well as chiral gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of both 2002](#11888049) and a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry [Gay 2001](#11417640) Capillary electrophoresis and isotachophoresis also have been applied, with some methods using cyclodextrin as a matrix to to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze ephedra alkaloids. [Yamasaki 1979](#Yamasaki.1979) Several systematic studies of alkaloid content in commercial ephedra samples have been conducted. One study used capillary electrophoresis to analyze 22 samples from Taiwan herbal markets and found that E. sinica samples were generally higher in alkaloid content than E. intermedia samples (1.6% vs 1.2%, respectively). The relative amounts of specific alkaloids in aboveground parts correlated well with the species studied, while root samples had no detectable alkaloids. [Liu 1993](#17235993) Because crude ephedra can be used as a starting substance for the synthesis of amphetamines, the profile of impurities was used to determine the origin of illicit amphetamine in Japan. [Makino 2002](#11873994) Another study examined 20 different dietary supplements from the United States market by HPLC and found that some products had no ephedra alkaloids, some had only ephedrine (suggesting the use of synthetic material), and others were properly labeled and contained the specified amount of alkaloid. [Gurley 2000](#10832496) American species of ephedra have been found to be devoid of or have very low amounts of alkaloids. Thus, species such as Ephedra nevadensis (Mormon tea) are not appropriate substitutes. [Terry 1927](#Terry.1927) Other types of compounds also have been isolated from ma huang. Tetramethylpyrazine has been identified as a pharmacologically active constituent of stems, and analytical methods have been developed. [Spyridaki 2001](#11486842), [Lv 2000](#10843553), [Zhao 2009](#19219730) In the roots, from the root. [Hikino 1982](#Hikino.1982) The polysaccharide stems. [Konno 1985](#4034736) The roots of ephedra have yielded a variety of hypotensive compounds, which were not found in the aboveground parts. Uses and Pharmacology The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first banned the sale of all dietary supplements containing ephedra in April 2004 based on a lack of evidence to support efficacy claims and more than 16,000 reported cases of adverse reactions. The ban was later overturned by a federal judge in April 2005 for products containing ephedra 10 mg or less. However, in May 2007, the ban was upheld by the US Supreme Court based on a final FDA regulation declaring dietary supplements containing adulterated ephedrine alkaloids as presenting an unreasonable risk of illness or injury under conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling, or if no conditions of use are suggested or recommended, under ordinary conditions of use. [FDA 2012](#FDA.2012), [Greenway 2001](#12120105) Athletic performance Animal data Ephedra-containing dietary supplements are banned by the FDA, making data from animal studies of their use as a performance enhancer irrelevant. Clinical data The use of ephedra-containing products in sports has been reported. [Tokish 2004](#15310585), [Avois 2006](#16799095), [Dhar 2005](#16212144) Few trials evaluating the ergogenic efficacy of ephedrine alone exist, and results suggest slight effects on performance. [Tokish 2004](#15310585), [Shekelle 2003](#12672771) However, combinations of ephedrine and caffeine have been reported to increase endurance in running and cycling experiments. [Dhar 2005](#16212144), [Shekelle 2003](#12672771) Most studies have been conducted by one group [Bell 2001](#11474345), [Bell 2002](#11828246) and because of the different types of exercise studied (endurance and power), the results cannot be pooled for analysis. [Shekelle 2003](#12672771) Because most classes of amphetamines are banned by the International Olympic Committee (except for medical use of ephedrine) and ephedra-containing supplements are banned by the FDA, further trials evaluating their efficacy are unlikely. [Tokish 2004](#15310585), [Avois 2006](#16799095) Weight loss Animal data Ephedra-containing supplements are banned by the FDA, making data from animal studies for use as a weight-loss aid irrelevant. Clinical data A combination of ephedrine with a caffeine-containing supplement, such as guarana or cola nut, has been most frequently used for weight loss. [Greenway 2001](#12120105) A meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of ephedra in weight loss published in 2003 found few published high-quality trials. Of those trials included, the pooled data favored ephedra and ephedrine over placebo in the short-term (less than 6 months), with about 0.9 kg/month weight loss compared with placebo but with wide confidence limits. [Shekelle 2003](#12672771) Other reviews 2005](#15867902), [Dulloo 2002](#12032740) The few trials that have been published since the 2004 ban on ephedra products came to similar conclusions, with enhanced thermogenesis proposed as the mechanism of action. [Greenway 2001](#12120105), [Vukovich 2005](#15730434) Whereas a variety of herbals (including ephedra) were shown to effectively decrease appetite and food intake in a 2009 systematic review of herbals used for management of obesity, significant adverse effects were reported only in studies using supplements containing ephedra and caffeine. [Hasani-Ranjbar 2009](#19575486) A more recent study in 7 volunteers attributed the weight loss activity of ephedra correlated to the changes in gut microbiota induced by ephedra consumption. [Kim 2014](#24556223) Other effects Antiviral Activity against a limited range of viruses has been shown in some, but not all, in vitro studies. [Soltan 2009](#19666102), [Murakami 2008](#19043222), [Lee 2010](#20437159) Antimicrobial activity have shown anti-inflammatory and immune effects in experiments in rodents and in vitro studies. Complement activation was inhibited and E. sinica showed protective effects against sequelae of spinal cord injury in one experiment. [Li 2009](#19000748) Chemical constituents ephedrannin A and B suppressed the transcription of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta in macrophages and in [Kim 2010](#20939997), [Yamada 2008](#18218321) Ephedra via arachidonic acid pathways, and alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulation in another laboratory experiment. [Ayajiki 2008](#18544894) Dosing There is a ban on the sale of all ephedra-containing dietary supplements in the United States. Doses of ephedra greater than 32 mg/day have resulted in adverse reactions. [Andraws 2005](#15991150) The pharmacokinetics of ephedra in humans have been studied, with ephedrine in crude herb requiring twice as long to reach the peak plasma concentration as pure ephedrine dosage forms. [White 1997](#9055137) Similarly, the combination of a single dose of ephedra and caffeine has been studied; ephedrine and pseudoephedrine had similar peak concentrations at 140 to 150 minutes, while caffeine blood levels peaked at 90 minutes. Overall results were similar to those of individual compounds in pure form. [Haller 2002](#12087345) Pregnancy / Lactation Documented adverse reactions. Avoid use. [Ernst 2002](#11950176), [Fleming 2008](#18983221) It may increase blood pressure and heart rate, cause CNS activity, and stimulate uterine muscle. Periconceptional use of ephedra-containing products has been associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio for anencephaly. [Bitsko 2008](#18553492) Interactions Although natural forms of ephedra may contain different chemical constituents than those of ephedrine, in general, interactions are likely to be similar to those established for the synthetic form of the latter and include MAOIs, the anesthetic propofol, cholinergic agents such as antagonize agents.

[Shekelle 2003](#12672771) A review of case reports found a trend toward an increased risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse reactions at doses lower than those used for weight loss (ephedra 32 mg/day vs 90 to 150 mg/day, respectively). [Andraws 2005](#15991150) A clinical trial in which 20 healthy adults were given ephedra 1 g dry extract (or placebo) daily for 14 days found increases in heart rate after taking ephedra. [Chen 2010](#20520603), [Chen 2010](#20573567) Case reports of adverse reactions continue to appear in the literature despite the FDA ban on ephedra products and include cardiomyopathies, arrhythmia and sudden death, myocardial infarction, coronary artery glucose and potassium homeostasis have also been demonstrated, and case reports of ischemic colitis and gastric mucosal angle-closure glaucoma was reported in a 52-year-old female associated with ma-huang within 24 hours of first dose. She had no past medical history and presented in the emergency department with acute bilateral ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, headache, nausea, and vomiting. [Ryu 2017](#29390365) Data collected between 2004 and 2013 from 8 US centers in the Drug-induced Liver Injury Network revealed that 15.5% (130) of hepatotoxicity cases were caused by herbals and dietary supplements, whereas 85% (709) of cases were related to prescription medications. Of the 130 cases of liver injury related to supplements, 65% were from non-bodybuilding supplements and occurred most often in Hispanics/Latinos compared with non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. Liver transplant was also more frequent with toxicity from non-bodybuilding supplements (13%) than with conventional medications (3%) (P<0.001). Overall, the proportion of severe liver injury cases was significantly higher for supplements than for conventional medications (P=0.02). Of the 217 supplement products implicated in liver injury, 175 had identifiable ingredients, of which ephedra was among the 32 (18%) single-ingredient products. [Navarro 2014](#25043597) The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) clinical practice guideline for drug-induced liver injury (2019) recommends physicians consider herbal and dietary supplements as potential causative agents associated with liver injury (Level 4; Grade C), including ephedra (Ma Huang). [EASL 2019](#30926241) In the 2016 Scientific Statement by the American Heart Association regarding drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure, ephedra (ma-huang) and ephedra-like products have been recognized as products with stimulant effects on blood pressure and heart rate as well as an increased risk of mortality and morbidity, and should be avoided. The guidance noted that naturoceuticals are not recommended for the management of heart failure symptoms or for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, and that nutritional supplements are not recommended for the treatment of heart failure [Low-quality; Limited].
