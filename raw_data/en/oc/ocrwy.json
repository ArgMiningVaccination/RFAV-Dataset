The idea surrounding Naturopathy is that the naturopathic doctor aims to treat the person, not just the condition. It is the belief that mind, body, and spirit can be healed. They utilize different methods of natural remedies such as herb usage, massage, acupuncture, and exercise. This is stepping away from the treatment of conventional medicine, but not completely. Naturopathic doctors can help to treat multiple health conditions. These include: Allergies, headaches, infertility, obesity, digestive issues, hormonal imbalances, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue syndrome. What Is a Cleanse/Detox? Cleansing/Detoxing is meant to remove the toxins from your body. They are also used for people who are trying to lose weight. People who are planning on cleansing or detoxing should prepare for diet changes. Fast food is not going to help clear out our impurities, as much as I wish it would. Some cleanses require fasting, some require a strict diet, and some you are only drinking liquids for the duration of the detox. While on a detox, you should make sure that you are taking in plenty of water. These are also only recommended as a temporary \"diet\" and you should not continue to detox or cleanse for too long, as this would be unhealthy for your body. Different Types of Foods That Can Cleanse Your Body Naturally - Artichokes - Beets - Broccoli - Fresh Fruits & Vegetables - Protein - Onions & Garlic When You Should Avoid Detox/Cleanses You should not partake in a detox if you have any medical conditions involving blood pressure, cholesterol, or heart issues. People with diabetes should definitely not try to detox with a cleanse. Because cleanses are low in calorie intake, this can be especially unhealthy. The average calorie intake for the day should be around 2000 for women and 2500 for men. Different Types of Cleanses - Juice Cleanses: This type of cleanse usually lasts between 3-10 days on average. It requires you to only drink fresh juice. Juices are said to be good for you because fruits and vegetables contain a lot of vitamins and minerals. Some juices also contain anti-inflammatory agents, which may help boost your immune system. - Smoothie Cleanse: If you're on the go and don't have time to stop, a smoothie is a great temporary option. Most people do not get their daily intake of nutrients, so what better way to get your nutrient intake in than a green veggie smoothie?! A cleansing smoothie can also help you if you are having trouble staying energized.

Cleanses, such as the master cleanse, are a good way to cleanse your colon. During a master cleanse, you are to drink the \"Master Cleanse Lemonade\" 6-12 times a day. It consists of organic lemon juice, organic grade B maple syrup, ground cayenne pepper, and filtered water. This will be in combination with a nightly herbal laxative. This cleanse is low in calories, which could be extremely unhealthy so it's recommended for no more than 6 days. Liver Cleanse Another important cleanse you can do is for your liver. Your liver is obviously a very vital organ that you need to live a healthy life. The purpose of a liver cleanse is to remove all the old bile that has been built up in there and improve liver function. Be warned that during a liver flush, people have been known to find multiple deposits of green bile in their toilets. If you happen to have worms, they will come out too. During the cleanse, there are foods and drinks that you should avoid, along with ones that are best for your cleanse. It is also important to drink a lot of water and only eating small quantities of food. Avoid Foods & Drinks such as: - Animal Proteins - Dairy - Fried food and spicy foods - Coffee, Alcohol, & Tobacco - Processed foods - Cold/Frozen Drinks Food/Drinks that are necessary: - Whole grains - Fruits & Vegetables - Cottage Cheese - Yogurt - Natural fruits and nuts - Water, tea, and herbal tea Kidney Cleanse Like your liver, your kidneys are a very vital part of your body.
