There are people who like to collect shoes or handbags. I like to collect experiences...... well, some experiences anyway. The not so nice experiences I have kept in the further-est closet of my memory like those old, mouldy shoes you feel you can't throw out for some reason but will never actually wear. I never knew why I had this hunger for experiences until coming across homeopathy, as well as a meditation group in my mid twenties. So far between the two practices, some of my biggest questions have found an answer. There was one question, however, that made a significant impact on me and it was one I never even thought to ask. Back when I was attending homeopathic student clinic I sat in on a case where a young guy announced, in front of all the students and the clinic supervisor, that he had come that day with the intention of using homeopathy as a means to fast track his spiritual development. I was instantly intrigued. Being very new to both homeopathy and meditation I was full of curiosity and wonder, and his question opened a whole new area of possibilities. I looked around at my smirking classmates, half of me wishing my life could be so simple that I could smirk along with them. The other half was wildly thinking about how such a thing could be done. It didn't take long before the dozens of tiny details called everyday life got in the way of my wonderings and after a while I didn't have time for thinking about things too deeply, what with finishing my studies and bringing up young children. Now over twelve years later, with a little experience in both homeopathy and meditation under my belt, I am going to make an attempt at exploring this possibility in more depth, rather than just thinking about it as an interesting concept. What is true health? When we think of health we often only think of our physical bodies and how strongly our immune system is able to fight off disease. But then often we hear it bandied around that there is a body/mind/emotion connection and most people would agree that when they are feeling happy within themselves their bodies seem to be able to cope better with keeping illness at bay. So to me it's a fairly rational step to put forward the theory that the immune system has a counterpart on all the levels of ourselves. What really makes up a human being? For those who follow the conventional way of thinking, a human would be made up of physical organs, skin, muscle and bone, with a bunch of chemical reactions dictating the way we respond to the challenges of an equally physical and chemical world. But what if a human being was made up of a series of 'bodies', each more subtle than the last, where the emotions and the thoughts themselves also had their own substance of sorts? And what if each of these bodies had its own 'immune system' that was intimately connected to the others? That would mean at least two extra parts to the immune system that wouldn't be able to be measured by blood tests or antibody levels. Is there more than just the personality? Another question I often asked before coming across homeopathy and meditation was, \"What/who/ decides that I will be the one that catches every gastro bug going around when the people around me don't even get a tummy gurgle?\" And \"Why do I seem to get them so much more often when I'm going through a difficult time, or feeling especially cranky? And what/who decides why my thoughts are directed to all this questioning of my reality and not towards...... shoes and handbags instead?\" A Vital Force, or Life Force perhaps? So. that leads to thinking about a very popular concept embraced by most natural therapists and a precious few conventional medical practitioners: the existence of something not confined to the personality. In my limited understanding and experience it's something that glues the different facets of the personality together and somehow seeks to integrate and balance the whole; something that can exist independently of the personality, but which the personality can't live without. I also see it as something of incredible wisdom and intelligence, that has its source in a much greater being than anything we can possible imagine. So to me from this relatively more experienced end of things, it's completely natural and obvious that homeopathy, health and spirituality have a lot in common. The heart The heart represents a gateway or opening where you can consciously assist the life force to enter the personality. One of the most wonderful ways to connect with this life force is to spend a few minutes every day resting your attention in the centre of your chest. You may not notice anything for the first few times. It is incredibly subtle and will be hard to believe that doing such a thing can have so much influence over your health and your outlook. If you persevere and make it into a long term practice you may even find that you become more caring and compassionate with others, allowing you to be more flexible in all situations. Combine your practice with homeopathic treatment to further open your possibilities, and literally the sky is the limit! Yes, let me say it many times, please use homeopathy for spiritual development. Suppressions One of the things we do when we come across an emotion, thought or physical issue we don't \"like\", or that we don't think is OK, is to suppress it and pretend it's not there. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, and sometimes it's very important to do exactly that in the short term. But what happens to those thoughts, emotions and physical symptoms if they're not re-accepted back into our system to be dealt with at a later time? I'll tell you what happens to mine. They sit at the back of my consciousness and give off a constant, nagging little message of discomfort, getting triggered and reawakened at various times by events in my life. A part of me lives in a constant state of dread that something may happen to set one or more of them off. It even seems like I somehow attract those particular events so that the suppressions are constantly reawakened in little, annoying (or traumatic) ways. Sooner or later, I find that the problems caused from the triggers end up a whole lot worse than the original issues themselves. If I'm doing: a lot of meditation; taking the right homeopathic remedies for me (which help move things along); getting the right support from a homeopath (and not self medicating!) then it helps bring those suppressions from my subconscious closet out into my conscious awareness. Let's be honest here; the process is no picnic! To look at something you strongly dislike about yourself doesn't exactly feel very nice, and I wouldn't normally go looking for such an experience. But let's just say that once those problems are seen and understood from a larger perspective, it's more likely that you can make them a whole lot smaller, and sometimes if you can get to the very bottom of it, the emotion behind that trigger really can be neutralised. Really! I can tell you from my personal and real experiences, that if you turn and face those little nasties at the very back of the closets of your memories with the right support, you can, actually, beat them. It doesn't make you perfect. You'll still get irritated by too many red lights, or your partner's snoring, but you'll be less likely to allow those sorts of things to make the rest of your life a misery. A case of suppression being helped by using Homeopathy for Spiritual Development Recently a woman came to me asking what could be done to help her inability to make decisions. There are quite a few remedies that may help with indecision, but I needed to find out where it was coming from. Now, often when a homeopath asks questions to try and find out what may be under the most outward symptom, many people don't even know what may be motivating them to feel/act/react in a certain way. Those that do know may not wish to divulge such sensitive information, especially if it involves the darker of human tendencies such as extremes of anger, sexual issues or violence. But when you think about it, isn't there a part of us all lurking at the very base of ourselves, that's motivated by our very deepest, darkest fears? I have at times come face to face with mine, whether it's during the course of meditation or being triggered by unpleasant situations, and the result isn't exactly very pretty. But to understand those nasties in the context of higher spiritual concepts makes all the sense in the world to me. The west has turned its nose up at the ancient eastern ideas of karma, reincarnation and that which exists outside of physical senses or modern day gadgets. But, to explore some of these possibilities may just enable a better understanding of why so many people suffer, as well as giving a person more insight into how to relieve their own suffering. Lifting the lid on suppression Getting back to my client, it turned out that a major part of the problem of why she couldn't make decisions was a deep seated fear of doing the wrong thing. This is a fairly common issue amongst many people, but the reason why I am focusing on this particular client is that she had the very inspiring ability to venture under the surface to where the very core of the problem lay, despite her obvious terror of doing so. Having been doing meditation and spiritual work for many years, this woman recognised the value in rising above her fear of being judged, and opened that part of herself willingly. That is the spot where most people shut down because it's just too threatening and painful. Exploring what lay underneath enabled her to work out exactly what doing the wrong thing meant to her. It took a whole lot of guts for her to go there, but she faced it and put it into words for the very first time in her life. At its very basic level, the issue was far from something you'd chat to your girlfriends about at a coffee shop, so airing it in such a way was both terrifying and liberating for her. Afterwards, she commented on how incredible it had been for her to be able to speak so freely and what a relief it was to realise that what she thought was so awful was actually something she could work with now that she had brought it out and examined it in such a way. The remedies then went on to complete the job of supporting her working through the problem, and bringing to the surface other suppressed issues in a way that was bearable to her. It's not easy doing this, but the beauty is that with a bit of work, and if you're brave, you can be free from the things that are holding you back and stressing you out unreasonably. From a Homeopath's perspective This connection between homeopathy, health and spirituality isn't just something I've thought randomly about for the last few years. It's actually something I've been living and experiencing as an integral part of my own reality. I have come to realise that what I've been doing since that fateful question in student clinic is exactly that: trying to use homeopathy to compliment my spiritual advancement, and at the same time be the healthiest I can possibly be on all levels. To me it's one and the same thing, and can't be separated. Working together with a client with this purpose in mind allows a person to go through their own process of freeing themselves from their suffering. Of course it's vital to have a sound source of spiritual guidance if you choose to take on such path. But once you have some ground work in that area I would say that from my own and my clients' experiences that, yes, spiritual work and homeopathy can very successfully be used together to greatly enhance physical, emotional, mental and spiritual wellbeing; in all your various bodies.
