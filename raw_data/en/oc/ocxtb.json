What products are right for me? an introduction to living an ayurvedic lifestyle Ayurveda teaches us respect for Nature, appreciation of life and it gives us the means to empower ourselves. It is holistic medicine and daily lifestyle practices at its BEST. Ayurveda is ritual medicine. Prayer, invocation, sound, smell, herbs, transformation and intention to to name a few. These are all classical philosophies that grant us the solid framework and rooted principles to help us begin to understand our realities and make the necessary changes for balance and growth. Ayurveda is a life science that helps us to bridge the gap between our individual experience and our spiritual/ritualistic experience, bringing us closer to living in harmony on our journey for truth and peace of mind/heart/body. Dive in to the experience, learn more about WHAT IS AYURVEDA? by clicking the link below an introduction to the doshas What we love about Ayurveda (The sister science to Yoga) is that it really helps us to understand who we are. And when we begin to know who we are, we can make small but powerful changes to how we live which, when they take root, can blossom into great health, vitality, clarity, and personal evolution. So, how to find the right path? Well, the first step is in understanding your dosha. The three main doshas (constitutions) are Vata, Pitta and Kapha. We are all a unique combination of these doshas - these doshas are all based around Pancha Maha Bhutus (the 5 elements). Less often is our natural constitution singular (just vata) or tridoshic (vata/pitta/kapha). Ideally, our aim in Ayurveda is to bring our current state closer to our natural state. So, once we find our natural constitution, we begin to understand where our current state is out alignment with our healthy natural state. This is when we can practice even a few small changes and these can have dramatic impact and life long effect. Dinacharya: A guide to your daily ayurvedic routine Dinacharya is an important principle and practice in Ayurveda. It refers to a daily routine that's meant to maintain and promote physical + mental and spiritual health. According to Ayurveda, establishing a healthy and consistent dinacharya allows the body to be in tune with the cycles of nature, affording and promoting us optimal wellness while boosting our immunity. These daily practices help to create balance during the changes in doshas (the ever changing combination of elements...think seasons as an example), which occur naturally throughout the cycles of the day, week and month. The amazing activities included in Dinacharya may look like... cleansing, clearing, and bringing balance using specific tools such as Neti Pot, Nasya, Tongue Scraping, Oil Pulling, Abhyanga Self Massage, Exercise, Study, Breathwork, Meditation and Yoga.
