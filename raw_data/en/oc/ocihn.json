PURPOSE Dartmouth College is not a registered entity with the Federal Select Agent Program; therefore only research involving excluded select agents or toxins or permissible amounts (exempt quantities) of select agent toxins (SAT) is permitted. This Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) policy describes the requirements on the use of exempt or excluded select agents and toxins at Dartmouth. These requirements hav e been established to ensure safe handling and disposal procedures, effective tracking and security, and to be in compliance with federal regulations regarding select agent and toxin use. Any person wishing to begin research involving excluded or permissib le amounts of select agents or toxins must receive prior approval from the Dartmouth IBC before possession of the agent/toxin. II. DEFINITIONS Select Agents and Toxins : a subset of biological agents and toxins that the Departments of Health and Human Service s (HHS) and Agriculture (USDA) have determined to have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, to animal or plant health, or to animal or plant products. The current list of select agents and toxins is updated every two years an d can be found at: http://www.selectagents.gov/SelectAgentsandToxinsList.html . NOTE: Dartmouth is not part of the Federal Select Agent Program, so only excluded select agents or exempt quantities of select agent toxins are permitted . Select Agent and Toxin Nucleic Acids : nucleic acids that are capable of producing infectious forms of select agents and functional forms of select toxins, including complete genomes as well as recombinant and/or synthetic nucleic acids. The following are regulated as select agents: Nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any of the select agent viruses. Recombinant and/or synthetic nucleic acids that encode for the functional for m(s) of select toxins if the nucleic acids: i. Can be expressed in vivo or in vitro , or ii. Are in a vector or recombinant host genome and can be expressed in vivo or in vitro . Select agents and toxins that have been genetically modified. NOTE: Dartmouth is not part of the Federal Select Agent Program, so select agent and toxin nucleic acids, as defined above, are not permitted . Select Agent Regulations : Select agent s are governed by several regulations based on whether they affect humans, anima ls, or plants. They can be found at https://www.selectagents.gov/regulations/index.htm . 42 CFR Part 73 = covers human pathogens/toxins (HHS/CDC select agents/toxins) and those that can als o affect animals (called the \"overlap\" select agents/toxins) Select Agents and Toxins Approved by Dartmouth IBC on Ju ly 06, 2022 Page 2 of 13 9 CFR Part 121 = covers animal pathogens/toxins (USDA/APHIS) and those that can also affect humans (called the \"overlap\" select agents/toxins) 7 CFR Part 331 = covers plant pathogens/toxins (US DA/APHIS Plant Protection and Quarantine) Permissible Toxin Amounts (Exempt Quantities) : Certain toxins are not regulated if the amount under the control of a principal investigator does not exceed, at any time, the amounts indicated in Section VI.ii below. Please refer to the list provided on the Select Agent website for the most current information: http://www.selectagents.gov/PermissibleToxinAmounts.html . Excluded Select Agent or Toxin : An attenuated strain of a select biological agent or toxin that does not pose a severe threat to public health and safety, animal health, or animal products may be excluded from the requirements of the select agent regulations . Please refer to the Excluded Select Agents List for the most up to date information: http://www.selectagents.gov/SelectAgentsandToxinsExclusions.html . Tier 1 Agent : A subset of select agents and toxins have been designated as Tier 1 (per Executive Order 13546) because these biological agents and toxins present the greatest risk of deliber ate misuse with significant potential for mass casualties or devastating effect to the economy, critical infrastructure, or public confidence, and pose a severe threat to public health and safety. NOTE: NO Tier 1 agents are permitted at Dartmouth. Please refer to the Select Agents and Toxins list for the current Tier 1 agents: http://www.selectagents.gov/SelectAgentsandToxinsList.html . III.

PROCEDURES A. Authorization Any person wishing to begin research involving excluded or permissible amounts of select agents or toxins must receive prior approval from the Dartmouth Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) before possession of the agent/toxin. A lab -specific standard operating procedure (SOP) must be submitted to the IBC as part of the review. Contact the Biosafety Officer for assistance. B. Lab Specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) Lab specific SOPs for safe use of excluded or permissible amounts of select agents or toxins must be based upon the recommendations found in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) . Modifications or additional requirements may be made by the IBC. SOPs should contain information that includes the name of the agent or toxin, laboratory procedures using the agent or toxin, a risk assessment and how potential exposures will be avoided, appropriate personal protective equipment and facility/engineering containment measures, required training, deactivation and disposal procedures, signage, and any occupational health considerations (signs/symptoms of exposure , how to respond to an exposure, available treatments, etc.) See Appendix A for an example. C. Permissible Levels The following toxins are not regulated if the amount under the control of a principal investigator does not exceed, at any time, the amounts indicated in the FSAP Permissible Amounts List (Table 1). Table 1. Permissible Amounts of Select Agent Toxins (as of 2/16/17*) HHS Toxins [\u00a773.3(d)(3)] Amount Abrin mg Botulinum neurotoxins 1 mg Short, paralytic alpha conotoxins 100 mg Diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) 10000 mg Ricin 1000 mg Saxitoxin 500 mg Staphylococcal Enterotoxins (Subtypes A, B, C, D, and E) 100 mg T-2 toxin 10000 mg Tetrodotoxin 500 mg *Consult current list here: http://www.selectagents.gov/PermissibleToxinAmounts.html Select Agents and Toxins Approved by Dartmouth IBC on Ju ly 06, 2022 Page 5 of 13 In the event that a PI mistakenly acquires a quantity of select agent toxin greater than the permissible amount, they should contact the Biosafety Officer immediately. D. Training All personnel possessing, using, transferring, or receiving select agents or toxins must have agent - specific training as required by the IBC and Environmental Heal th & Safety (EHS). Training may be included as part of the lab -specific SOP. Retraining is required annually. At a minimum, agent specific training should include: Review SDS and physical properties and hazards of toxin Discuss routes, signs, and symptoms of exposure Discuss potential risks of experimental procedures that may result in an exposure Plan emergency actions and what to do in case of exposure Review available vaccinations or post -exposure (anti -toxin) management procedures Outline control measures for working with toxin (PPE, fume hood, transporting, never working alone, etc.) Identify appropriate methods for decontamination and disposal Discuss inventory control, lock box, and restricted access Review BMBL Appendix I \"Guidelines for work with toxins of biological origin\" This training is specific to each lab and is the responsibility o f the PI (assistance is available from EHS). Documentation of training including dates, material covered and signatures of attendees must be kept on file in the lab. These records should be maintained indefinitely. E. Lab Inspections Laboratories and campus facilities possessing, using, transferring or receiving exempt quantities or excluded select agents and toxins will be inspected periodically by EHS. If a facility is found to be in non- compliance, approval to work with the materials may be revoked by the IBC. See Appendix B for an example inspection checklist. F. Security All laboratories using, transferring, or receiving excluded or permissible amounts of select agents or toxins must comply with all of the security, inventory, and containment requirements as follows: Select agents/toxins must be secured against unauthorized access Select agents/toxins must be under lock and key security when not in use, including freezers, refrigerators, cabinets and other storage containers. An accurate inventory must be maintained ( see Appendix C ). Only authorized personnel are allowed in laboratory use areas during select agents/toxins use or transfer. Door signage must be in place when SAT are in use. Key control programs must be in place to track lab door and storage cabinet keys, including dates issued and returned. Locks must be changed if keys are lost or unaccounted. Select Agents and Toxins Approved by Dartmouth IBC on Ju ly 06, 2022 Page 6 of 13 G. Decontamination/Deactivation of Select Agents and Toxins i. Excluded Select Agents : Decontamination of excluded select agents should be conducted in accordance with the Dartmouth College Biohazard ous Waste Disposal Guide and the Emergency Response and Biohazard Exposure Control Plan . ii. Select Agent Toxins (permissible levels) : General guidelines for laboratory decontamination of selected toxins are summarized Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories , Appendix I, Guidelines for Work with Toxins of Biological Origin . iii. General guidelines for laboratory decontamination of selected select agent toxins are summarized in Table 2. Many toxins are susceptible to inactivation with dilute sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at concentrations of 0.1 -0.25N, and/or sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) bleach solutions at concentrations of 0.1 -0.5% (w /v). Use freshly prepared bleach solutions for decontamination; undiluted, commercially available bleach solutions typically contain 3 -6% (w/v) NaOCl. Consult the BMBL Appendix I, Guidelines for Work with Toxins of Biological Origin for more specific infor mation. Depending upon the toxin, contaminated materials and toxin waste solutions can be inactivated by incineration, autoclaving, or by soaking in suitable decontamination solutions. All disposable material used for toxin work should be placed in second ary containers, decontaminated in accordance with the appropriate method used to inactivate the toxin, autoclaved, and disposed of as hazardous waste. The initial decontamination step (ex: bleach soak) should occur immediately following use of the SAT. Con taminated waste should be autoclaved promptly. Contact EHS for assistance. Contaminated or potentially contaminated protective clothing and equipment should be decontaminated using suitable chemical methods or autoclaving before removal from the laborator y for disposal, cleaning or repair. If decontamination is impracticable, materials should be disposed of as hazardous waste. Contact EHS for assistance. In the event of a spill, avoid splashes or generating aerosols during cleanup by covering the spill with paper towels or other disposable, absorbent material. Apply an appropriate decontamination solution to the spill, beginning at the perimeter and working towards the center. Inactivation procedures should not be assumed to be 100% effective without validation using specific toxin bioassays. Please review the table below for appropriate measures for biological toxins. If you are working with a biological toxin not listed here, consult the EHS office for further assistance. Select Agents and Toxins Approved by Dartmouth IBC on Ju ly 06, 2022 Page 7 of 13 Table 2. Inactivation Methods for a Few Select Agent Toxins Toxin Chemical Inactivation Minimum 30 min contact time, unless otherwise noted below Steam Autoclave Dry Heat (oF) cycle, slow exhaust 200 500 1000 1500 Abrin YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES Botulinum neurotoxins YES YES YES* YES YES YES YES YES YES Diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) YES NO NO NO NO NO NO NO YES Ricin (2 protein chain, multimeric) YES YES YES* YES YES YES YES YES YES Saxitoxin YES YES YES* YES NO NO YES YES YES Staphylococcal enterotoxins Toxin YES* NO NO NO NO NO NO NO YES Tetrodotoxin YES YES YES* NO NO NO YES YES YES NaOCl = Sodium hypochlorite; NaOH = Sodium hydroxide; YES = complete inactivation; YES? = assumed inactivation; NO = no inactivation; * see recommendations below Adapted from BMBL , Appendix I; Biological Safety Principles and Practices ; and UC Denver/Anschutz EHS *Recommendations i. For complete inactivation of T -2 mycotoxins, all liquid samples, spills, and non -burnable waste shall be soaked in 2.5% NaOCl with 0.25N NaOH for 4 hours. All solid wastes will be segregated in a closed container for incineration in the chemical hazardous waste stream. It is further recommended that cages and bedding from animals exposed to T -2 mycotoxin be exposed to 0.25% NaOCl and 0.025 N NaOH for 4 hours, prior to further cage- cleaning/cage- wash operations. ii. Exposure to 1% NaOCl for 30 minutes is an effective inactivation method for saxitoxin, tetrodotoxin, ricin, botulinum toxin, or staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEB) for working solutions, equipment, working area and spills. iii. Autoclaving can be used for protein toxins, i.e. ricin , botulinum toxin, and SEB, but should not be used with any of the low molecular weight toxins. iv. Conotoxin inactivation depends on the presence or absence of disulfide bonds. For conotoxins with disulfide bonds: incubate with an excess of dithiothreitol (D TT) (10 -20 mM buffered solution, pH 8.7) for at least 1 hour at room temperature or 30 minutes at 50\u00b0C. Add an equal volume of 50 -100mM solution of iodoacetamide (buffered solution, pH 8.7) and incubate for 1 hour at room temperature. For conotoxins withou t disulfide bonds, incubate in a fume hood in a closed glass vial with 6N HCl for 24 hours at 90 -110\u00b0C. Select Agents and Toxins Approved by Dartmouth IBC on Ju ly 06, 2022 Page 8 of 13 H. Transfers - Due Diligence Provision The Federal Select Agent Program has a provision to address the concern that someone might stockpile toxins by receiving multiple orders below the excluded amount. The \"Due Diligence Provision\" requires a person (registered or unregistered) transferring toxins in amounts that would otherwise be excluded from the provisions to: i. use due diligence to assure that the recipient has a legitimate need to handle or use such toxins; and ii. report to FSAP if they detect a known or suspected violation or become aware of suspicious activity related to the toxin. The \"due diligence\" provision required under Section 16 applies to anyone (registered or unregistered individuals or entities) that transfers toxin listed under Section 73.3 in amounts that otherwise would be excluded from the regulations. To document those individuals who have a le gitimate purpose to handle and use such toxins, the transferor can either require the recipient to complete documentation stating their intended use of the toxins or the transferor can document their knowledge of the recipient's legitimate need for the toxins. Information pertinent to the person requesting and using the toxins includes the individual's name, institution name, address, telephone number, and e- mail address. I. Reporting Suspected Violation of Federal Law Suspicious Activity The FSAP has establ ished a confidential means for reporting safety and security issues associated with the possession, use and transfer of select agents and toxins. The HHS, Office of Inspector General (OIG) maintains a hotline that allows individuals to anonymously report f raud, waste and abuse in all departmental programs. This hotline is now available to anonymously report safety or security issues related to select agents and toxins. When reporting these issues to OIG, please ensure that you indicate it is a \"Select Agent Program\" issue.
