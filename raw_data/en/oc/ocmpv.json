Services which are not received from a PCP, SCP or another Network Provider or approved as an Authorized Service will be considered a Non -Network service, except as specified above. The amount payable for Covered Services varies depending on whether you receive your care from a Health Certificate COVERED SERVICES M-23 PCP, SCP or another Network Provider or a Non-Network Provider , except for Emergen cy Care and Urgent Care. If you use a Non-Network Provider , you are responsible for the difference between the Non-Network Provider' s charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount, in addition to any applicable Coinsurance, Copayment or Deductible. We cannot prohibit Non-Network Providers from billing you for the difference in the Non-Network Provider' s charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount. All Covered Services and benefits are subject to the conditions, Exclusions, limitations, terms and provisions of this Certificate, including any attachments, riders and endorsements. Covered Services must be Medically Necessa ry and not Experimental/Investigative. The fact that a Provider may prescribe, order , recommend or approve a service, treatment or supply does not make it Medically Necessa ry or a Covered Service and does not guarantee payment. To receive maximum benefits for Covered Services, you must follow the terms of the Certificate, including receipt of care from a PCP, SCP or another Network Provider , and obtain any required Prior Authorization or Precertification. Contact your Network Provider to be sure that Prior Authorization/Precertification has been obtained. We base Our decisions about Prior Authorization, Precertification, Medical Necessit y, Experimental/Investigative services and new technology on Our clinical coverage guidelines and medical policy. We may also consider published peer-review medical literature, opinions of experts and the recommendations of nationally recognized public and private organizations which review the medical effectiveness of health care services and technolog y. Benefits for Covered Services may be payable subject to an approved treatment plan created under the terms of this Certificate. Benefits for Covered Services are based on the Maximum Allowable Amount for such service. Our payment for Covered Services will be limited by any applicable Coinsurance, Copayment, Deductible, or Benefit Period Limit/Maximum. Ambulance Services See the Schedule of Benefits for any applicable Deductible, Coinsurance, Copayment, and Benefit Limitation information. Medically Necessa ry ambulance services are a Covered Service when one or more of the following criteria are met: You are transported by a state licensed vehicle that is designed, equipped, and used only to transport the sick and injured and staffed by Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), paramedics, or other certified medical professionals.

Benefits also include Medically Necessa ry treatment of a sickness or injury by medical professionals from an ambulance service, even if you are not taken to a Facilit y. Important Notes on Air Ambulance Benefits Benefits are only available for air ambulance when it is not appropriate to use a ground or water ambulance. For example, if using a ground ambulance would endanger your health and your medical condition requires a more rapid transport to a Facility than the ground ambulance can provide, the Plan will cover the air ambulance. Air ambulance will also be covered if you are in an area that a ground or water ambulance cannot reach. Air ambulance will not be covered if you are taken to a Hospital that is not an acute care Hospital (such as a Skilled Nursing Facility), or if you are taken to a Physician 's office or your home. Hospital to Hospital Transport If you are moving from one Hospital to anothe r, air ambulance will only be covered if using a ground ambulance would endanger your health and if the Hospital that first treats cannot give you the medical services you need. Certain specialized services are not available at all Hospitals. For example, burn care, cardiac care, trauma care, and critical care are only available at certain Hospitals. To be covered, you must be taken to the closest Hospital that can treat you. Coverage is not available for air ambulance transfers simply because you, your famil y, or your Provider prefers a specific Hospital or Physici an. Autism Spectrum Disorder Services Coverage is provided for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. Treatment is limited to services prescribed by your Physician in accordance with a treatment plan.

Any exclusion or limitation in this Certificate in conflict with the coverage described in this provision will not apply.

If you perform an act, practice, or omission that constitutes fraud or make an intentional misrepresentation of material fact, as prohibited by the terms of your Plan, your coverage and the coverage of your dependents can be retroactively terminated or rescinded if: 1) your coverage has been in force for less than two years, or 2) the fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact concerns eligibilit y. A rescission of coverage means that the coverage may be legally voided back to the start of your coverage under the Plan, just as if you never had coverage under the Plan. You will be provided with a thirty (30) calendar day advance notice with appeal rights before your coverage is retroactively termina ted or rescinded. You are responsible for paying Us for the cost of previously received services based on the Maximum Allowable Amount for such services, less any Copayments made or Premium paid for such services. Health Certificate M-68 Termination A Dependent 's coverage will terminate at the end of the billing period in which notice was received by Us that the person no longer meets the definition of Dependent, except when indicated other wise in the Schedule of Benefits. If coverage is through an association, coverage will terminate on the date membership in the association ends. If you elect coverage under another carrier' s health benefit plan or under any other non- Anthem plan which is offered by, through, or in connection with the Group as an option instead of this Plan, then coverage for you and your Dependents will terminate at the end of the billing period for which Premium has been paid, subject to the consent of the Group. The Group agrees to immediately notify Us that you have elected coverage elsewhere. If you fail to pay or fail to make satisfacto ry arrangements to pay any amount due to Us or Network Providers (including the failure to pay required Deductibles and/or Copayments), We may terminate your coverage and may also terminate the coverage of all your Dependents, effective immediately upon Our written notice to the Group. If you permit the use of your or any other Member 's Plan Identification Card by any other person; use another person' s card; or use an invalid card to obtain services, your coverage will terminate immediately upon Our written notice to the Group. Any Subscriber or Dependent involved in the misuse of a Plan Identification Card will be liable to and must reimburse Us for the Maximum Allowable Amount for services received through such misuse. Removal of Members Upon written request through the Group, a Subscriber may cancel the enrollment of any Member from the Plan. If this happens, no benefits will be provided for Covered Services provided after the Member 's terminatio n date. Reinstatement You will not be reinstated automatically if coverage is terminated. Re-application is necessa ry, unless termination resulted from inadvertent clerical error. No additions or terminations of membership will be processed during the time your or the Group' s request for reinstatement is being considered by Us. Your coverage shall not be adversely affected due to the Group' s clerical error. Howeve r, the Group is liable to Us if We incur financial loss as a result of the Group 's clerical error. Certification of Prior Creditable Coverage If your coverage is terminated, you and your covered Dependents will receive a certification showing when you were covered under the Plan. You may need the document to qualify for another Group health Plan. Certifications may be requested within 24 months of losing coverage. You may also request a certification be provided to you at any other time, even if you have not lost coverage under this plan. If you have any questions, contact the customer service telephone number listed on the back of your Identification Card. Health Certificate Termination M-69 Continuation Federal Continuation of Coverage (COBRA) The following applies if you are covered under a Group which is subject to the requirements of the Consolidated Omnib us Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985, as amended. COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you when you would other wise lose coverage under your Group' s health plan. It can also become available to other Members of your famil y, who are covered under the Group' s health plan, when they would other wise lose their health coverage. For additional information about your rights and obligations under federal law under the coverage provided by the Group' s health plan, you should contact the Group. COBRA Continuation Coverage COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of health coverage under the Group' s health plan when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event known as a \"qualifying event.\" Specific qualifying events are listed below . After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiar y.\" You, your spouse, and your Dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Group' s health plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Under the Group' s health plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage may or may not be required to pay for COBRA continuation coverage. Contact the Group for Premium payment requirements. If you are a Subscribe r, you will become a qualified beneficia ry if you lose your coverage under the Group' s health plan because either one of the following qualifying events happens: Your hours of employment are reduced, or Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. If you are the spouse of a Subscribe r, you will become a qualified beneficiar y if you lose your coverage under the Group' s health plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: Your spouse dies; Your spouse' s hours of employment are reduced; Your spouse' s employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. Your Dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Group' s health plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: The parent -Subscriber dies; The parent -Subscriber 's hours of employment are reduced; The parent -Subscriber 's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; The parent -Subscriber becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both); Health Certificate M-70 Termination The parents becom e divorced or legally separated; or The child stops being eligible for coverage under the Group' s health plan as a \"Dependent child.\" If Your Group Offers Retirement Coverage Sometimes, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code can be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is filed with respect to the Group, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage of any retired Subscriber covered under the Group' s health plan, the retired Subscriber will become a qualified beneficiar y with respect to the bankruptcy . The retired Subscriber 's spouse, surviving spouse, and Dependent children will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under Group' s health plan. When is COBRA Coverage Available The Group will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Group has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, death of the Subscribe r, commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employe r, or the Subscriber 's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), then the Group will notify the COBRA Administrator (e.g., Human Resou rces, external vendor) of the qualifying event. You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events For the other qualifying events (divo rce or legal separation of the Subscriber and spouse or a Dependent child 's losing eligibility for coverage as a Dependent child), you must notify the Group within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs. How is COBRA Coverage Provided Once the Group receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries. Each qualified beneficiar y will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered Subscribers may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBR A continuation coverage on behalf of their children. How Long Will Continuation Coverage Last? In the case of a loss of coverage due to end of employment or reduction in hours of employment, coverage may be continued only for up to a total of 18 months . In the case of losses of coverage due to the Subscriber 's death, divorce or legal separation, the Subscriber 's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits or a Dependent child ceasing to be a Dependent under the terms of the Group' s health plan, coverage may be continued for up to a total of 36 months. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the Subscriber 's hours of employment, and the Subscriber became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage for qualified beneficiaries other than the Subscriber lasts until 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. Health Certificate Termination M-71 How Can You Extend The Length of COBRA Continuation Coverage? If you elect continuation coverage, an extension of the maximum period of coverage may be available if a qualified beneficiar y is disabled or a second qualifying event occurs. You must notify the Group of a disability or a second qualifying event in order to extend the period of continuation coverage. Failure to provide notice of a disability or second qualifying event may affect the right to extend the period of continuation coverage. Disability An 11-month extension of coverage may be available if any of the qualified beneficiaries is determined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to be disabled. You must provide the SSA determination of your disability to the Group within 60 days of receipt. The disability has to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuati on coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18-month period of continuation coverage. Each qualified beneficiar y who has elected continuation coverage will be entitled to the 11-month disability extension if one of them qualifies. If the qualified beneficia ry is determined by SSA to no longer be disabled, you must notify the Group of that fact within 30 days after SSA's determination. Second Qualifying Event An 18-month extension of coverage will be available to spouses and Dependent children who elect continuation coverage if a second qualifying event occurs during the first 18 months of continuation coverage. The maximum amount of continuation coverage available when a second qualifying event occurs is 36 months. Such second qualify ing events may include the death of a covered Subscriber , divorce or separation from the covered Subscriber , the covered Subscriber 's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), or a Dependent child 's ceasing to be eligible for coverage as a Dependent under the Group' s health plan. These events can be a second qualifying event only if they would have caused the qualified beneficia ry to lose coverage under the Plan if the first qualifying event had not occurred. You must notify the Group within 60 days after a second qualifying event occurs if you want to extend your continuation coverage. Trade Act of 1974 Special COBRA rights apply to Subscribers who have been terminated or experienced a reduction of hours and who qualify for a \"trade readjustment allowance\" or \"alternative trade adjustment assistance\" under a federal law called the Trade Act of 1974. These Subscribers are entitled to a second opportunity to elect COBRA coverage for themselves and certain family members (if they did not already elect COBRA coverage), but only within a limited period of sixty (60) days (or less) and only during the six (6) months immediately after their Group health plan coverage ended. If you, the Subscribe r, qualify for assistance under the Trade Act of 1974, you should contact the Group for additional information. You must contact the Group promptly after qualifying for assistance under the Trade Act of 1974 or you will lose these special COBRA rights. Premiums and the End of COBRA Coverage Premium will be no more than 102% of the Group rate (unless your coverage continues beyond 18 months because of a disabilit y. In that case, premium in the 19th through 29th months may be 150% of the Group rate). Health Certificate M-72 Termination Continuation coverage will be terminated before the end of the maximum period if: any required premium is not paid in full on time, a qualified beneficia ry becomes covered, after electing continuation coverage, under another group health plan, a qualified beneficia ry becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both) after electing continuation coverage, or the Group ceases to provide any group health plan for its employees. If You Have Questions Questions concerning your Group' s health plan and your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be addressed to the Group. For more information about your rights under ERISA, including COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other laws affecting group health plans, conta ct the nearest Regional or District Office of the U.S. Department of Labor 's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) in your area or visit the EBSA website at www.dol.gov/ebsa. (Addresses and phone number s of Regional and District EBSA Offices are available through EBSA's website.) Continuation of Coverage Due To Military Service In the event you are no longer Actively At Work due to militar y service in the Armed Forces of the United States, you may elect to continue health coverage for yourself and your Dependents (if any) under this Certificate in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. \"Milita ry service\" means performance of duty on a volunta ry or involunta ry basis, and includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training, and full-time National Guard duty. You may elect to continue to cover yourself and your eligible Dependents (if any) under this Certificate by notifying your employer in advance and payment of any required contribution for health coverage. This may include the amount the Employer normally pays on your behalf. If Your milita ry service is for a period of time less than 31 days, You may not be required to pay more than the active Member contribution, if any, for continuation of health coverage. If continuation is elected under this provision, the maximum period of health coverage under this Certificate shall be the lesser of: The 24-month period beginning on the first date of your absence from work; or The day after the date on which You fail to apply for or return to a position of employment. Regardless whether you continue your health coverage, if you return to your position of employment your health coverage and that of your eligible Dependents (if any) will be reinstated under this Certificate. No exclusions or waiting period may be imposed on you or your eligible Dependents in connection with this reinstatem ent unless a sickness or injury is determined by the Secreta ry of Veterans Affairs to have been incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance of militar y service. Health Certificate HOW TO OBTAIN COVERED SERVICES M-73 Conversion A Subscriber and any eligible Dependents who have been continuously covered under this Certificate, or any group coverage it replaced, for at least ninety (90) days are entitled to an individual conversion plan under the following conditions: The Subscriber or Member loses coverage under this Certificate as a result of: 1. termination of employment; 2. reduction of hours; 3. marriage dissolution; 4. or attainment of limiting age. The Subscriber or Member is not eligible for federal continuation coverage (COBRA). The Subscriber or Member requests an individual conversion plan within thirty (30) days after the loss of Group coverage. The Subscriber or Member shall not be required to meet any additional waiting periods and shall receive credit for any applicable waiting period, Deductibles, or Out of Pocket amounts satisfied under this Certificate. The Deductible, Coinsurance and Copayments amounts under the conversion plan may be different than those under this coverage. Coverage under the conversion plan shall terminate for the following reasons: Non-payment of Premiums; or Cancellation of the individual conversion plan by the Member or Subscriber . Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 A Subscriber who is taking a period of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (the Act) will retain eligibility for coverage during this period. The Subscriber and his or her Dependents shall not be considered ineligible due to the Subscriber not being Actively At Work. If the Subscriber does not retain coverage during the leave period, the Subscriber and any eligible Dependents who were covered immediately prior to the leave may be reinstated upon return to work without medical unde rwriting and without imposition of an additional waiting period. To obtain coverage for a Subscriber upon return from leave under the Act, the Group must provide the Plan with evidence satisfacto ry to Us of the applicability of the Act to the Subscribe r, including a copy of the health care Provider statement allowed by the Act. 9 HOW TO OBTAIN COVERED SERVICES Network Provi ders are the key to providing and coordinating your health care services. Benefits are provided when you obtain Covered Service from Providers; howeve r, the broadest benefits are provided for services obtained from a Prima ry Care Physician (PCP), Specialt y Care Physician (SCP), or other Network Providers. Services you obtain from any Provider other than a PCP, SCP or another Network Provider are considered a Non -Network Service, except for Emergency Care, Health Certificate M-74 HOW TO OBTAIN COVERED SERVICES Urgent Care, or as an Authorized Service. Contact a PCP, SCP, other Network Provider , or Us to be sure that Prior Authorization and/or precertification has been obtained. If a Non-Network Provider meets Our enrollment criteria and is willing to meet the terms and conditions for participation, that Provider has the right to become a Network Provider for the product associated with this Certificate. Network Services and Benefits If your care is rendered by a PCP, SCP, or another Network Provider benefits will be paid at the Network level. Regardless of Medical Necessit y, no benefits will be provided for care that is not a Covered Service even if performed by a PCP, SCP, or another Network Provider . All medical care must be under the direction of Physicians. We have final authority to determine the Medical Necessity of the service. We may inform you that it is not Medically Necessa ry for you to receive services or remain in a Hospital or other facilit y. This decision is made upon review of your condition and treatment. You may appeal this decision. See the Member Grievances section of this Certificate. Network Providers - include Prima ry Care Physicians (PCP), Specialty Care Physicians (SCP), other professional Providers, Hospitals, and other facility Providers who contract with Us to perform services for you. PCPs include general practitioners, internists, family practitioners, pediatricians, obstetricians & gynecologists, geriatrician or other Network Providers as allowed by the Plan. The Prima ry Care Physician is the Physician who may provide, coordinate, and arrange your health care services. SCP's are Network Physician who provide specialty medical services not normally provided by a PCP. Referrals are never needed to visit a Network Specialist including behavioral health Providers. To see a doctor , call their office: Tell them you are an Anthem Member , Have your Member Identification Card handy . The doctor 's office may ask you for your group or Member ID numbe r. Tell them the reason for your visit. When you go to the office, be sure to bring your Member Identification Card with you. For services rendered by Network Providers: 1. You will not be required to file any claims for services you obtain directly from Network Providers. Network Providers will seek compensation for Covered Services rendered from Us and not from you except for approved Coinsurance, Copayments and/or Deductibles. You may be billed by your Network Provider(s) for any non-Covered Services you receive or when you have not acted in accordance with this Certificate. 2. Health Care Management is the responsibility of the Network Provide r. If there is no Network Provider who is qualified to perform the treatment you require, contact Us prior to receiving the service or treatment and We may approve a Non-Network Provider for that service as an Authorized Service. Health Certificate HOW TO OBTAIN COVERED SERVICES M-75 After Hours Care If you need care after normal business hours, your doctor may have several options for you. You should call your doctor 's office for instructions if you need care in the evenings, on weekends, or during the holidays and cannot wait until the office reopens. If you have an Emergenc y, call 911 or go to the nearest Emergency Room. How to Find a Provider in the Network There are three ways you can find out if a Provider or Facility is in the network for this Certificate. You can also find out where they are located and details about their license or training. See the directo ry of Network Providers at www.anthem.com, which lists the Doctors, Providers, and Facilities that participate in this Plan' s network. Call Customer Service to ask for a list of doctors and Providers that participate in this Plan's network, based on specialty and geographic area. Check with your doctor or Provide r. If you need help choosing a doctor who is right for you, call the Customer Service number on the back of your Member Identification Card. TTY/TDD services also are available by dialing 711. A special operator will get in touch with Us to help with your needs. Non-Network Services Services which are not obtained from a PCP, SCP, or another Network Provider or not an Authorized Service will be considered a Non-Network Service. The only exception is Emerge ncy Care and Urgent Care. In addition, certain services are not covered unless obtained from a Network Provide r, see your Schedule of Benefits. For services rendered by a Non-Network Provider , you are responsible for: The difference between the actual charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount plus any Deductible and/or Coinsurance/Copayments; Services that are not Medically Necessa ry; Non-Covered Services; Filing claims; and Higher cost sharing amounts. Relationship of Parties (Plan - Network Providers) The relationship between the Plan and Network Providers is an independent contractor relationship. Network Providers are not agents or employees of the Plan, nor is the Plan, or any employee of the Plan, an employee or agent of Network Providers. Health Certificate M-76 CLAIMS PAYMENT The Plan shall not be responsible for any claim or demand on account of damages arising out of, or in any manner connected with, any injuries suffered by a Member while receiving care from any Network Provider or in any Network Provid er's facilities. Your Network Provider 's agreement for providing Covered Services may include financial incentives or risk sharing relationships related to provision of services or referrals to other Providers, including Network Providers, Non-Network Providers, and disease management programs. If you have questions regarding such incentives or risk sharing relationships, please contact your Provider or the Plan. Not Liable for Provider Acts or Omissions The Plan is not responsible for the actual care you receive from any person. This Certificate does not give anyone any claim, right, or cause of action against the Plan based on the actions of a Provider of health care, services or supplies. Identification Card When you receive care, you must show your Identification Card. Only a Member who has paid the Premiums under this Certificate has the right to services or benefits under this Certificate. If anyone receives services or benefits to which they are not entitled to under the terms of this Certificate, he/she is responsible for the actual cost of the services or benefits. 10 CLAIMS PAYMENT When you receive care through a Network Provide r, you are not required to file a claim. This means that the provisions below , regarding Claim Forms an d Notice of Claim, do not apply unless the Provider did not file the claim. A claim must be filed for you to receive Non-Network Services benefits, but many Non-Network Hospitals, Physicians and other Providers will still submit your claim for you. If you submit the claim, use a claim form. How Benefits Are Paid Maximum Allowed Amount General This section describes how We determine the amount of reimbursement for Covered Services. Reimbursement for services rendered by Network and Non-Network Provider s is based on this/your Certificate' s Maximum Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that You receive. Please see the Inter-Plan Programs section for additional information. The Maximum Allowed Amount for this Certificate is the maximum amount of reimburs ement We will allow for services and supplies: that meet Our definition of Covered Services, to the extent such services and supplies are covered under your Certificate and are not excluded; Health Certificate CLAIMS PAYMENT M-77 that are Medically Necessar y; and that are provi ded in accordance with all applicable preauthorization, utilization management or other requirements set forth in Your Certificate. You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent You have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. In addition, when You receive Covered Services from a Non-Network Provider , You may be responsible for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Provider' s actual charges. This amount can be signific ant. When You receive Covered Services from Provide r, We will, to the extent applicable, apply claim processing rules to the claim submitted for those Covered Services. These rules evaluate the claim information and, among other things, determine the accuracy and appropriateness of the procedure and diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect Our determination of the Maximum Allowed Amount. Our application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services You received were not Medically Necessar y. It means We have determined that the claim was submitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example, your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum Allowed Amount will be based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed Amount for each billed code. Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Physician or other healthcare professional, We may reduce the Maximum Allowed Amounts for those seconda ry and subsequent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the prima ry procedure that may be considered incidental or inclusive. Provider Network Status The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is a Network Provider or a Non-Network Provide r. A Network Provider is a Provider who is in the managed network for this specific product or in a special Center of Excellence/or other closely managed specialty network, or who has a participation contract with Us. For Covered Services performed by a Network Provider , the Maximum Allowed Amount for this/your Certificate is the rate the Provider has agreed with Us to accept as reimbursement for the Covered Services. Because Network Providers have agreed to accept the Maximum Allowed Amount as payment in full for those Covered Services, they should not send You a bill or collect for amounts above the Maximum Allowed Amount. Howeve r, You may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent You have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. Please call Customer Service for help in finding a Network Provider or visit www.anthem.com. Providers who have not signed any contract with Us and are not in any of Our networks are Non-Network Providers, subject to Blue Cross Blue Shield Association rules governing claims filed by certain ancilla ry providers. For Covered Services You receive from a Non-Network Provider , the Maximum Allowed Amount for this Certificate will be one of the following as determined by Us: 1. An amount based on Our Non-Network Provider fee schedule/rate, which We have established in Our discretion, and which We reser ve the right to modify from time to time, after considering one Health Certificate M-78 CLAIMS PAYMENT or more of the following: reimbursement amounts accepted by like/similar providers contracted with Us, reimbursement amounts paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the same services or supplies, and other indust ry cost, reimbursement and utilization data; or 2. An amount based on reimbursement or cost information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). When basing the Maximum Allowed amount upon the level or method of reimbursement used by CMS, We will update such information, which is unadjusted for geographic localit y, no less than annually; or 3. An amount based on information provided by a third party vendo r, which may reflect one or more of the following factors: (1) the complexity or severity of treatment; (2) level of skill and experience required for the treatment; or (3) comparable Providers' fees and costs to deliver care, or 4. An amount negotiated by Us or a third party vendor which has been agreed to by the Provide r. This may include rates for services coordinated through case management, or 5. An amount based on or derived from the total charges billed by the Non-Network Provide r. Providers who are not contracted for this product, but are contracted for other products with Us are also considered Non-Network. For this/your Certificate, the Maximum Allowed Amount for services from these Providers will be one of the five methods shown above unless the contract between Us and that Provider specifies a different amount. Unlike Network Providers, Non-Network Providers may send You a bill and collect for the amount of the Provider' s charge that exceeds Our Maximum Allowed Amount. You are responsible for paying the differen ce between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the amount the Provider charges. This amount can be significant. Choosing a Network Provider will likely result in lower Out of Pocket costs to You. Please call Customer Service for help in finding a Network Provider or visit Our website at www.anthem.com. Customer Service is also available to assist You in determining this/your Certificate' s Maximum Allowed Amount for a particular service from a Non-Network Provider . In order for Us to assist You, You will need to obtain from your Provider the specific procedure code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services the Provider will render . You will also need to know the Provider' s charges to calculate your Out of Pocket responsibilit y. Although Customer Service can assist You with this pre-service information, the final Maximum Allowed Amount for your claim will be based on the actual claim submitted by the Provide r. For Prescription Drugs: The Maximum Allowed Amount is the amount determined by Us using prescription drug cost information provided by the Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM). Member Cost Share For certain Covered Services and depending on your plan design, You may be required to pay a part of the Maximu m Allowed Amount as Your cost share amount (for example, Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance). Your cost share amount and Out-of-Pocket Limits may vary depending on whether You received services from a Network or Non-Network Provider . Specifica lly, You may be required to pay higher cost sharing amounts or may have limits on your benefits when using Non-Network Providers. Please see the Schedule of Benefits in this Certificate for your cost share responsibilities and limitations, or call Customer Service to learn how this Certificate' s benefits or cost share amounts may vary by the type of Provider You use. Health Certificate CLAIMS PAYMENT M-79 We will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You may be responsible for the total amount billed by your Provider for non-Covered Services, regardless of whether such services are performed by a Network or Non Network Provide r. Non- Covered Services include services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of this Certificate and services received after benefits have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, benefit caps or day/visit limits. In some instances You may only be asked to pay the lower Network cost sharing amount when You use a Non-Network Provider . For example, if You go to a Network Hospital or Provider facility and receive Covered Services from a Non-Network Provider such as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist who is employed by or contracted with a Network Hospital or facilit y, You will pay the Netw ork cost share amounts for those Covered Services. Howeve r, You also may be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Non-Network Provider 's charge. The following are examples for illustrative purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Certificate 's cost share amounts; see Your Schedule of Benefits for Your applicable amounts. Example: Your plan has a Coinsurance cost share of 20% for Network services, and 30% for Non-Network services after the Network or Non- Network Deductible has been met. You undergo a surgical procedur e in a Network Hospital. The Hospital has contracted with a Non- Network anesthesiologist to perform the anesthesiology services for the surger y. You have no control over the anesthesiologist used. The Non-Network anesthesiologist 's charge for the service is $1200. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the anesthesiology service is $950; Your Coinsurance responsibility is 20% of $950, or $190 and the remaining allowance from Us is 80% of $950, or $760. You may receive a bill from the anesthesiologist for the difference between $1200 and $950. Provided the Deductible has been met, your total Out of Pocket responsibility would be $190 (20% Coinsurance responsibility) plus an additional $250, for a total of $440. You choose a Network surgeon. The charge was $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surger y is $1500; Your Coinsurance responsibility when a Network surgeon is used is 20% of $1500, or $300. We allow 80% of $1500, or $1200. The Networ k surgeon accepts the total of $1500 as reimbursement for the surger y regardless of the charges. Your total out of pocket responsibility would be $300. You choose a NON -NETWORK surgeon. The Non- Network surgeon' s charge for the service is $2500. The Maxi mum Allowed Amount for the surger y service is $1500; Your Coinsurance responsibility for the NON -NETWORK surgeon is 30% of $1500, or $450 after the NON -NETWORK Deductible has been met. We allow the remaining 70% of $1500, or $1050. In addition , the Non-Network surgeon could bill You the difference between $2500 and $1500, so your total Out of Pocket charge would be $450 plus an additional $1000, for a total of $1450 . Authorized Services In some circumstances, such as where there is no Network Provider available for the Covered Service, We may authorize the Network cost share amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service You receive from a Non-Network Provider . In such circumstance, You must contact Us in advance of obtaining the Covered Service. We also may authorize the Network cost share amounts to apply to a claim for Covered Services if You receive Emergency services from a Non-Network Provider and are not able to contact Us until after the Covered Service is rendered. If We authorize a Network cost share amount to apply to a Covered Service received from a Non-Network Provide r, You also may still be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Health Certificate M-80 CLAIMS PAYMENT Non-Network Provider 's charge. Please contact Customer Service for Authorized Services information or to request authorization. The following are examples for illustrative purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Certificate 's cost share amounts; see Your Schedule of Benefits for Your applicable amounts. Example: You require the services of a specialty Provider; but there is no Network Provider for that specialty in your state of residence. You contact Us in advance of receiving any Cove red Services, and We authorize You to go to an available Non-Network Provider for that Cove red Service and We agree that the Network cost share will apply. Your plan has a $45 Copayment for Non-Network Providers and a $25 Copayment for Network Providers for the Cove red Service. The Non-Network Provider 's charge for this service is $500. The Maximum Allowed Amount is $200. Because We have authorized the Network cost share amount to apply in this situation, You will be responsible for the Network Copayment of $25 and We will be responsible for the remaining $175 of the $200 Maximum Allowed Amount. Because the Non- Network Provider 's charge for this service is $500, You may receive a bill from the Non-Network Provider for the difference between the $500 charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount of $200. Combined with your Network Copayment of $25, your total out of pocket expense would be $325. Payment of Benefits You authorize Us to make payments directly to Providers for Covered Services. Payments may also be made to, and notic e regarding the receipt and/or adjudication of claims sent to, an Alternate Recipient (any child of a Subscriber who is recognized, under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMSCO), as having a right to enrollment under the Group' s Contract), or that person 's custodial parent or designated representative. Any payments made by Us will discharge Our obligation to pay for Covered Services. You cannot assign your right to receive payment to anyone else, except as required by a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" as defined by ERISA or any applicable state law. Once a Provider performs a Covered Service, We will not honor a request for Us to withhold payment of the claims submitted. Services Performed During Same Session We may combine the reimbursement of Covered Services when more than one service is performed during the same session. Reimbursement is limited to Our Maximum Allowable Amount. If services are performed by Non Network Provider s, then you are responsible for any amounts charged in excess of Our Maximum Allowable Amount with or without a referral or regardless if allowed as an Authorized Service. Contact Us for more information. Assignment The Group cannot legally transfer this Certificate, without obtaining written permi ssion from the Plan. Members cannot legally transfer the coverage.

The notice must be given to Us within 90 days of receiving the Covered Services, and must have the data We need to determine benefits. If the notice submitted does not include sufficient data We need to process the claim, then the necessar y data must be submitted to Us within the time frames specified in this provision or no benefits will be payable except as other wise required by law. If We have not received the information We need to process a claim, We will ask for the additional information necessar y to complete the claim. You will receive a copy of that request for additional information, for your information. In those cases, We cannot complete the processing of the claim until the additional information requested has been received. We will make Our request for additional information within 30 days of Our initial receipt of the claim and will complete Our processing of the claim within 15 days after Our receipt of all requested information. An expense is considered incurred on the date the service or supply was given. If We are unable to complete processing of a claim because you or your Provider fail to provide Us with the additional information within 60 days of Our request, the claim will be denied and you will be financially responsible for the claim. Failure to give Us notice within 90 days will not reduce any benefit if you show that the notice was given as soon as reasonably possible. No notice of an initial claim, nor additional information on a claim can be submitted later than one year after the 90 day filing period ends, and no request for an adjustment of a claim can be submitted later than 24 months after the claim has been paid. Time Benefits Payable We will pay all benefits within 30 days for clean claims filed electronicall y, or 45 days for clean claims filed on pape r. \"Clean claims\" means a claim submitted by you or a Provider that has no defect, impropriet y, or particular circumstance requiring special treatment preventing payment. If We have not received the information We need to process a claim, We will ask for the additional information necessar y to complete the claim.

In those cases, We cannot complete the processing of the claim until the additional information requested has been received.

At Our discretion, benefits will be paid to you or the Provider of services. You may not assign any payment. If other parties have paid benefits under this Plan, We may reimburse those other parties and be fully discharged from that portion of its liability . Claim Forms Claim forms will usually be available from most Providers. If forms are not available, either send a written request for claim forms to Us, or contact customer service and ask for claim forms to be sent to you. The form will be sent to you within 15 days. If you do not receive the claim forms, written notice of services render ed may be submitted to Us without the claim form. The same information that would be given on the claim form must be included in the written notice of claim. This includes: Name of patient. Patient 's relationship with the Subscribe r. Health Certificate M-82 CLAIMS PAYMENT Ident ification number . Date, type and place of service. Your signature and the Provider' s signature.

Any Member who fails to cooperate (including a Member who fails to enroll under Part B of the Medicare program where Medicare is the responsible payor) will be responsible for any charge for services. Explanation of Benefits (EOB) After you receive medical care, you will receive an explanation of benefits (EOB). The EOB is a summa ry of the coverage you receiv e. The EOB is not a bill, but a statement from Us to help you understand the coverage you are receiving. The EOB shows: Total amounts charged for services/supplies received. The amount of the charges satisfied by your coverage. The amount for which you are responsible (if any). General information about your appeals rights and for ERISA plans, information regarding the right to bring action after the Appeals Process. Inter-Plan Programs Out-of-Area Services Anthem has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees referred to generally as \"Inter -Plan Programs.\" Whenever you obtain healthcare services outside of Anthem 's Service Area, the claims for these services may be processed through one of these Inter-Plan Programs, which include the BlueCard Program and may include negotiated National Account arrangements available between Anthem and other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Licensees. Typicall y, when accessing care outside Anthem 's Service Area, you will obtain care from healthcare Providers that have a contractual agreement (i.e., are \"participating Providers\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). In some instances, you may obtain care from nonparticipating healthcare Providers. Anthem 's payment practices in both instances are described below. Health Certificate CLAIMS PAYMENT M-83 BlueCardOR Program Under the BlueCar dOR Program, when you access covered healthcare services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, Anthem will remain responsible for fulfilling Anthem's contractual obligations. Howeve r, the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its participating healthcare Providers. Whenever you access covered healthcare services outside Anthem's Service Area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay for covered healthcare services is calculated based on the lower of: The billed covered charges for your Covered Services; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Anthem. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to your healthcare Provide r. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with your healthcare Provider or Provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionall y, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of healthcare Providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of modifications of past pricing for the types of transaction modifications noted above. Howeve r, such adjustments will not affect the price Anthem uses for your claim because they will not be applied retroact ively to claims already paid. Federal law or the law in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to your calculation. If federal law or any state laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a surcharge, We would then calculate your liability for any covered healthcare services according to applicable law. Non-Participating Healthcare Providers Outside Our Service Area Member Liability Calculation When covered healthcare services are provided outside of Our Service Area by non- participating healthcare providers, the amount you pay for such services will generally be based on either the Host Blue' s nonparticipating healthcare provider local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state law. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the non- participating healthcare provider bills and the payment We will make for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. Exceptions In certain situations, We may use other payment bases, such as billed covered charges, the payment We would make if the healthcare services had been obtained within Our Service Area, or a special negotiated payment, as permitted under Inter-Plan Programs Policies, to determine the amount We will pay for services rendered by nonparticipating healthcare providers. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the non- participating healthcare provider bills and the payment We will make for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. Health Certificate M-84 CLAIMS PAYMENT If you obtain services in a state with more than one Blue Plan network, an exclusive network arrangement may be in place. If you see a Provider who is not part of an exclusive netwo rk arrangement, that Provider 's service(s) will be considered Non-Network care, and you may be billed the difference between the charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount. You may call the Customer Service number on your ID card or go to www .anthem.com for more information about such arrangements.

Their purpose is to promote the delive ry of cost-effective medical care by reviewing the use of procedures and, where appropriate, the setting or place of service that they are performed. Your Plan requires that Cove red Services be Medically Necessar y for benefits to be provided. When setting or place of service is part of the revie w, services that can be safely provided to you in a lower cost setting will not be Medically Necessa ry if they are performed in a higher cost setting. Prior Authorization: Network Providers are required to obtain prior authorization in order for you to receive benefits for certain services. Prior authorization criteria will be based on multiple sources including medical policy, clinical guidelines, and pharmacy and therapeutics guidelines. We may determine that a service that was initially prescribed or requested is not Medically Necessa ry if you have not previously tried alternative treatments which are more cost effective. If you have any questions regarding the information contained in this section, you may call the Precertification telephone number on the back of your Identification Card or visit www.anthem.com. Types of Requests: Precer tification - A required review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage determination which must be obtained prior to the service, treatment or admission start date. For emergency admissions, you, your authorized representative or Physician must notify Us within 48 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. For childbirth admissions, Precertification is not required unless there is a complication and/or the mother and baby are not discha rged at the same time. Predete rmination - An optional, voluntar y Prospective or Concurrent request for a benefit coverage determination for a service or treatment. We will review your Certificate to determine if there is an exclusion for the service or treatment. If there is a related clinical coverage guideline, the benefit coverage review will include a review to determine whether the service meets the definition of Medical Necessity under this Certificate or is Experimental/Investigative as that term is defined in this Certificate. Medical Review - A Retrospective review for a benefit coverage determination to determine the Medical Necessity or Experimental/Investigative nature of a service, treatment or admission that did not require Precertificati on and did not have a Predetermination review performed. Medical Reviews occur for a service, treatment or admission in which We have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by Us. Health Certificate M-86 HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT Most Network Providers know which services require Precertification and will obtain any required Precertification or request a Predetermination if they feel it is necessa ry. Your Prima ry Care Physician and other Network Providers have been provided detailed information regarding Health Care Management procedures and are responsible for assuring that the requirements of Health Care Management are met. The ordering Provider , facility or attending Physician will contact Us to request a Precertification or Predetermination review (\"requesting Provider\"). We will work directly with the requesting Provider for the Precertification request. Howeve r, you may designate an authorized representative to act on your behalf for a specific request. The authorized representative can be anyone who is 18 years of age or older . Who is responsible for Prece rtification Services provided by a Net- work Provider Services provided by a BlueCard/Non -Network/Non - Participating Provider Provider Member is responsible for Precertification. Member is financially responsible for service and/or set- ting that are/is not covered under this Certificate based on an Adverse Determination of Medical Necessity or Experimen - tal/Investigative. We will utilize Our clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy and other internally developed clinical guidelines, and preventative care clinical coverage guidelines, to assist in making Our Medical Necessity decisions. These guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions identified as appropriate medical practice. We reser ve the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines periodicall y. Your Certificate and Group Contract take precedence over these guidelines. You are entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to any documents relevant to your request. To request this information, contact the Precertification telephone number on the back of your Identification Card. We may, from time to time, waive, enhance, modify or discontinue certain medical management processes (including utilization management, case management, and disease management) if in Our discretion, such change is in furtherance of the provision of cost effective, value based and/or quality services. In addition, We may select certain qualifying Providers to participate in a program that exempts them from certain procedural or medical management processes that would other wise apply. We may also exempt your claim from medical review if certain conditions apply. Just because We exempt a process, Provider or claim from the standards which otherwise would apply, it does not mean that We will do so in the future, or will do so in the future for any other Provide r, claim or Membe r. We may stop or modify any such exemption with or without advance notice. You may determine whether a Provider is participating in certain programs by contacting customer service number on the back of your ID card. Request Categories: Urgent - a request for Precertification or Predetermination that in the opinion of the treating Provider or any Physician with knowledge of the Member 's medical condition, could in the absence of such care or treatment, seriously jeopardize the life or health of the Member or the ability of the Member to regain maximum function or subject the Member to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without such care or treatment. Health Certificate HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT M-87 Prospective - a request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted prior to the service, treatment or admission. Concur rent - a request for Precertification or Predetermination that is conducted during the course of treatment or admission. Retrospective - a request for Precertification that is conducted after the service, treatment or admission has occurr ed. Medical Reviews are also retrospective. Retrospective review does not include a review that is limited to an evaluation of reimbursement levels, veracity of documentation, accuracy of coding or adjudication of payment.

This Certificate, the Group Contract, the Group application, any Riders, Endorsements or Attachments, and the individual applications of the Subscriber and Dependents, if any, constitute the entire Contract between the Plan and the Group and as of the Effective Date, supersede all other agreements between the parties. Any and all statements made to the Plan by the Group and any and all statements made to the Group by the Plan are representations and not warranties, and no such statement, unless it is contained in a written application for coverage under this Certificate, shall be used in defense to a claim under this Certificate. Form or Content of Certificate No agent or employee of the Plan is authorized to change the form or content of this Certificate. Changes can only be made through a written authorization, signed by an officer of the Plan. Disagreement with Recommended Treatment Each Member enrolls in the Plan with the understanding that they, in consultation with their Providers, are responsible for determining the treatment appropriate for their care. You may, for personal reasons, refuse to accept procedures or treatment recommended by your Providers. Providers may regard such refusal to accept their recommendations as incompatible with continuance of the Physician -patient relationship and as obstructing the provision of proper medical care. In this event, the Provider shall have no further responsibility to provide care to you, and We shall have no obligation to have Network Providers available who will render the care. If you refuse to follow a recommended treatment or procedure, and the Provider believes that no professionally acceptable alternative exists, you will be so advised. In such case, neither the Plan, nor any Provider shall have any further responsibility to provide care in the case of the Provider , and to arrange care in the case of the Plan for the condition under treatment or any complications thereof. Circumstances Beyond the Control of the Plan If circumstances arise that are beyond the control of the Plan, the Plan will make a good- faith gesture to arrange an alternative method of providing coverage. Circumstances that may occu r, but are not within the control of the Plan, include but are not limited to, a major disaster or epidemic, complete or partial destruction of facilities, a riot, civil insurrection, labor disputes that are out of the control of the Plan, disability affecting a significant number of a Network Provider' s staff or similar causes, or health care services provided under this Certificate are delayed or considered impractical. Under such circumstances, the Plan and Network Providers will provide the health care services covered by this Certificate as far as is practical under the circumstan ces, and according to their best judgment. Howeve r, the Plan and Network Providers will accept no liability or obligation for delay , or failure to provide or arrange health care services if the failure or delay is caused by events/ci rcumstances beyond the control of the Plan. Health Certificate M-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS Coordination Of Benefits This Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies when you have health care coverage under more than one Plan. Please note that several terms specific to this provision are listed below . Some of these terms have different meanings in other parts of the Certificate, e.g., Plan. For this provision only, \"Plan\" will have the meanings as specified in the below . In the rest of the Certificate, Plan has the meaning listed in the Definitions section. The order of benefit determination rules determine the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benefits. The Plan that pays first is called the Prima ry Plan. The Prima ry Plan must pay benefits according to its policy terms regardless of the possibility that another Plan may cover some expenses. The Plan that pays after the Prima ry Plan is the Seconda ry Plan. The Seconda ry Plan may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all Plans do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable expense. The Allowabl e expense under COB is the higher of the Prima ry and Secondar y Plans' allowable amounts. A Network Provider can bill you for any remaining Coinsurance, Deductible and/or Copayment under the higher of the Plans' allowable amounts. This higher allowabl e amount may be more than Our Maximum Allowable Amount. COB DEFINITIONS Plan is any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered parts of the same Plan and there is no COB among those separate contracts. 1. Plan includes: Group and non group insurance contracts and subscriber contracts; Health maintenance organization (HMO) contrac ts; Uninsured arrangements of group or group- type coverage; Coverage under group or non group closed panel plans; Group- type contracts; Medical care components of long term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; medical benefits under group or individual automobile contracts (whether \"fault\" or \"no fault\"); Other governmental benefits, except for Medicaid or a government plan that, by law, provides benefits that are in excess of those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan. 2. Plan does not include: Accident only coverage; Specified disease or specified accident coverage; Limited health benefit coverage; Benefits for non-medical components of long- term care policies; Hospital indemnity coverage benefits or other fixed indemnity coverage; School accident -type coverages covering grammar , high school, and college students for accidents only, including athletic injuries, either on a twenty -four (24) hour or \"to and from school\" basis; and Medicare supplement policies. Each contract for coverage under items 1. or 2. above is a separate Plan. If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan. This Plan means the part of the contract providing health care benefi ts that the COB provision applies to and which may be reduced because of the benefits of other plans. Any other part of the contract providing health care benefits is separate from This Plan. A contract may apply one COB provision to certain benefits, such as dental benefits, coordinating only with similar benefits, and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benefits. The order of benefit determination rules determine whether This Plan is a Prima ry Plan or Seconda ry Plan when you have health care coverage under more than one Plan. Health Certificate GENERAL PROVISIONS M-95 When This Plan is prima ry, it determines payment for its benefits first before those of any other Plan without considering any other Plan' s benefits. When This Plan is secondar y, it determines its benefits after those of another Plan and may reduce the benefits it pays so that all Plan benefits do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable expense. Allowable expense is a health care expense, including Deductibles, Coinsurance and Copayments, that is covered at least in part by any Plan covering you. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an Allowable expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any Plan covering you is not an Allowable expense. In addition, any expense that a Provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging you is not an Allowable expense; howeve r, if a Provider has a contractual agreement with both the Prima ry and Seconda ry Plans, then the higher of the of the contracted fees is the Allowable expense, and the Provider may charge up to the higher contracted fee. The following are non Allowable expenses: 1. The difference between the cost of a semi -private hospital room and a private hospital room is not an Allowable expense, unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses. 2. If you are covered by 2 or more Plans that calculate their benefit payments on the basis of usual and customa ry fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement methods, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specific benefit is not an Allowable expense. 3. If you are covered by 2 or more Plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees is not an Allowable expense. 4. If you are covered by one Plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and custo mary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement method and another Plan that provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the Prima ry Plan's payment arrangement will be the Allowable expense for all Plans. Howeve r, if the Provider has contracted with the Seconda ry Plan to provide the benefit or service for a specific negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the Prima ry Plan's payment arrangement and if the Provider 's contr act permits, the negotiated fee or payment will be the Allowable expense used by the Seconda ry Plan to determine its benefits. 5. The amount of any benefit reduction by the Prima ry Plan because you have failed to comply with the Plan provisions is not an Allowable expense. Examples of these types of Plan provisions include second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions or services, and Network Provider arrangements. 6. The amount that is subject to the Prima ry high- deductible health plan' s deductible, if We have been advised by you that all Plans covering you are high- deductible health plans and you intend to contribute to a health savings account established in accordance with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 7. Any amounts incurred or claims made under the Prescription Drug program of this Plan. Closed panel plan is a Plan that provides health care benefits primarily in the form of services through a panel of Providers that contract with or are employed by the Plan, and that excludes coverage for services provided by other Providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel membe r. Health Certificate M-96 GENERAL PROVISIONS Custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year excluding any temporar y visitation. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMIN ATION RULES When you are covered by two or more Plans, the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are: The Prima ry Plan pays or provides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits of under any other Plan. 1. Except as provided in Paragraph 2. below , a Plan that does not contain a coordination of benefits provision that is consistent with this COB provision is always prima ry unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying Plan is primar y. 2. Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits and provides that this supplementar y coverage will be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder . Examples of these types of situations are major medical coverages that are placed over base plan hospital and surgi cal benefits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a Closed panel plan to provide out-of-network benefits. A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benefits only when it is seconda ry to that other Plan. Each Plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply: Rule 1 - Non-Dependent or Dependent . The Plan that covers you other than as a Dependent, for example as an employee, membe r, policyholde r, subscriber or retiree is the Prima ry Plan, and the Plan that covers you as a Dependent is the Seconda ry Plan. Howeve r, if you are a Medicare beneficiar y and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondar y to the Plan covering you as a Dependent and prima ry to the Plan covering you as other than a Dependent (e.g. a retired employee), then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering you as an employee, membe r, policyholder , subscriber or retiree is the Seco ndary Plan and the other Plan covering you as a Dependent is the Prima ry Plan. Rule 2 - Dependent Child Covered Under More Than One Plan. Unless there is a court decree stating other wise, when a Dependent child is covered by more than one Plan the order of benefits is determined as follows: 1. For a Dependent child whose parents are married or are living together , whether or not they have ever been married: The Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the Prima ry Plan; or If both parents have the same birthday , the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Prima ry Plan. 2. For a Dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together , whether or not they have ever been married: If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the Dependent child 's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is prima ry. This rule applies to plan years commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree; Health Certificate GENERAL PROVISIONS M-97 If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the Dependent child 's health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of 1. above will determine the order of benefits; If a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the Dependent child, the provisions of 1. above will determine the order of benefits; or If there is no court decree assigning responsibility for the Dependent child' s health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows: The Plan covering the Custodial parent; The Plan covering the spouse of the Custodial parent; The Plan covering the non-custodial parent; and then The Plan covering the spouse of the non-custodial parent. 3. For a Dependent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of item 1. above will determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child. Rule 3 - Active Employee or Retired or Laid -off Employe e. The Plan that covers you as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid off nor retired, is the Prima ry Plan. The Plan also covering you as a retired or laid-off employee is the Seconda ry Plan. The same would hold true if you are a Depe ndent of an active employee and you are a Dependent of a retired or laid-off employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if \"Rule 1 - Non- Dependent or Dependent\" can determine the order of benefits. Rule 4 - COBRA or State Continuation Coverag e. If you are covered under COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federal law and are covered under another Plan, the Plan covering you as an employee, membe r, subscriber or retiree or covering you as a Dependent of an employee, membe r, subscriber or retiree is the Prima ry Plan and the COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the Secondar y Plan. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if \"Rule 1 - Non- Dependent or Dependent\" can determine the order of benefits. Rule 5 - Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage . The Plan that covered you longer is the Prima ry Plan and the Plan that covered you the shorter period of time is the Seconda ry Plan. Rule 6. If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits, the Allowable expenses will be shared equally between the Plans meeting the definition of Plan. In addition, This Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the Prima ry Plan. EFFECT ON THE BENEFITS OF THIS PLAN When this Plan is seconda ry, it may reduce its benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans during a plan year are not more than the total Allowable expenses. In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the Seconda ry Plan will calculate the benefits it would have paid in the absence of other health care coverage and apply that calculated amount to any Allowable expense under its Plan that is unpaid by the Prima ry Plan. The Seconda ry Plan may then reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the Prima ry Plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans for the claim do not exceed the total Allowable expense for that claim. Health Certificate M-98 GENERAL PROVISIONS Because the Allowable expense is the higher of the Prima ry and Seconda ry Plans' allowable amounts, a Network Provider can bill you for any remaining Coinsurance, Deductible and/or Copayment under the higher allowable amount. In addition, the Seconda ry Plan will credit to its Plan deductible any amounts it would have credited to its deductible in the absence of other health care coverage. If you are enrolled in two or more Closed panel plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non-panel Provide r, benefits are not payable by one Closed panel plan, COB will not apply between that Plan and other Closed panel plans. RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NEEDED INFORMA TION Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans. We may get the facts We need from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying these rules and determining benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans covering the person claiming benefits. We need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under This Plan must give Us any facts We need to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. FACILITY OF PAYMENT A payment made under another Plan may include an amount that should have been paid under This Plan. If it does, We may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under This Plan. We will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payme nt made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. RIGHT OF RECOVE RY If the amount of the payments made by Us is more than should have paid under this COB provision, We may recover the excess from one or more of the persons: 1. We have paid or for whom We have paid; or 2. Any other person or organization that may be responsible for the benefits or services provided for the Member. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. Medicare Any benefits covered under both this Certificate and Medicare will be paid pursuant to Medicare Seconda ry Payor legislation, regulations, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines, subject to federal court decisions. Federal law controls whenever there is a conflict among state law, Certificate provisions, and federal law. Except when federal law requires the Plan to be the prima ry payo r, the benefits under this Certificate for Members age 65 and older , or Members otherwise eligible for Medicare, do not duplicate any benefit for which Members are entitled under Medicare, including Parts B and/or D. Where Medicare is the Health Certificate GENERAL PROVISIONS M-99 responsible payo r, all sums payable by Medicare for services provided to Members shall be reimbursed by or on behalf of the Members to the Plan, to the extent the Plan has made payment for such services. For the purposes of the calculation of benefits, if the Member has not enrolled in Medicare Part B, we will calculate benefits as if they had enrolled. Physical Examination When a claim is pending, We reser ve the right to request a Member to be examined by an applicabl e Provider . This will be requested as often as reasonably required. Workers' Compensation The benefits under this Certificate are not designed to duplicate benefits that Members are eligible for under the Workers' Compensation Law. All money paid or owed by Workers' Compensation for services provided to a Member shall be paid back by, or on behalf of, the Member to the Plan if the Plan has made or makes payment for the services received. It is understood that coverage under this Certificate does not replace or affect any Workers' Compensation coverage requirements. Other Government Programs The benefits under this Certificate shall not duplicate any benefits that Members are entitled to, or eligible for, under any other governmental program. This does not apply if any particular laws require the Plan to be the prima ry payor . If the Plan has duplicated such benefits, all money paid by such programs to Members for services they have or are receiving, shall be paid by or on behalf of the Member to the Plan. Subrogation and Reimbursement These provisions apply when We pay benefits as a result of injuries or illness you sustained and you have a right to a Recove ry or have received a Recove ry. Subrogation We have the right to recover payments We make on your behalf from any party responsible for compensating you for your injuries. The following apply: We have the first priority for the full amount of benefits We have paid from any Recove ry regardless of whether you are fully compensated, and regardless of whether the payments you receive make you whole for your losses and injuries. You and your legal representative must do whatever is necessar y to enable Us to exercise Our rights and do nothing to prejudice them. We have the right to take whatever legal action We see fit against any party or entity to recover the benefits paid under this Plan. Health Certificate M-100 GENERAL PROVISIONS To the extent that the total assets from which a Recover y is available are insufficient to satisfy in full Our subrogation claim and any claim still held by you, Our subrogation claim shall be first satisfied before any part of a Recover y is applied to your claim, your attorney fees, other expenses or costs. We are not responsible for any attorney fees, other expenses or costs without Our prior written consent. We further agree that the \"common fund\" doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney you hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benefits paid by Us. Reimbursement If you obtain a Recove ry and We have not been repaid for the benefits We paid on your behalf, We shall have a right to be repaid from the Recove ry in the amount of the benefits paid on your behalf and the following apply: You must reimburse Us to the extent of benefits We paid on your behalf from any Recove ry. Notwithstanding any allocation made in a settlement agreement or court order, We shall have a right of Recove ry, in first priorit y, against any Recove ry. You and your legal representative must hold in trust for Us the proceeds of the gross Recove ry (i.e., the total amount of your Recove ry before attorney fees, other expenses or costs) to be paid to Us immediately upon your receipt of the Recover y. you must reimburse Us, in first priority and without any set-off or reduction for attorney fees, other expenses or costs. The \"common fund\" doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney you hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benefits paid by Us. If you fail to repay Us, We shall be entitled to deduct any of the unsatisfied portion of the amount of benefits We have paid or the amount of your Recover y whichever is less, from any future benefit under the Plan if: 1. The amount We paid on your behalf is not repaid or otherwise recovered by Us; or 2. you fail to cooperate. In the event that you fail to disclose to Us the amount of your settlement, We shall be entitled to deduct the amount of Our lien from any future benefit under the Plan. We shall also be entitled to recover any of the unsatisfied portion of the amount We have paid or the amount of your settlement, whichever is less, directly from the Providers to whom We have made payments. In such a circumstance, it may then be your obligation to pay the Provider the full billed amount, and We would not have any obligation to pay the Provide r. We are entitled to reimbursement from any Recove ry, in first priorit y, even if the Recove ry does not fully satisfy the judgment, settlement or under lying claim for damages or fully compensate or make you whole. Health Certificate GENERAL PROVISIONS M-101 Your Duties You must notify Us promptly of how, when and where an accident or incident resulting in personal injury or illness to you occurred and all information regarding the parties involved. You must cooperate with Us in the investigation, settlement and protection of Our rights. You must not do anything to prejudice Our rights. You must send Us copies of all police reports, notices or other papers received in connection with the accident or incident resulting in personal injury or illness to you. You must promptly notify Us if you retain an attorney or if a lawsuit is filed on your behalf. Right of Recovery Whenever payment has been made in error, We will have the right to recover such payment from you or, if applicable, the Provider . In the event We recover a payment made in error from the Provide r, except in cases of fraud, We will only recover such payment from the Provider during the 24 months after the date We made the payment on a claim submitted by the Provider . We reserve the right to deduct or offset any amounts paid in error from any pending or future claim. The cost share amount shown in your Explanation of Benefits is the final determination and you will not receive notice of an adjusted cost share amount as a result of such recove ry activit y. We have oversight responsibility for compliance with Provider and vendor and Subcontractor contracts. We may enter into a settlement or compromise regarding enfor cement of these contracts and may retain any recoveries made from a Provider , Vendo r, or Subcontractor resulting from these audits if the return of the overpayment is not feasible. We have established recover y policies to determine which recoveries are to be pursued, when to incur costs and expenses and settle or compromise recove ry amounts. We will not pursue recoveries for overpayments if the cost of collection exceeds the overpayment amount. We may not provide you with notice of overpayments made by Us or you if the recove ry method makes providing such notice administratively burdensome. Relationship of Parties (Group -Member Plan) Neither the Group nor any Member is the agent or representative of the Plan. The Group is responsible for passing information to the Membe r. For example, if the Plan gives notice to the Group, it is the Group' s responsibility to pass that information to the Membe r. The Group is also responsible for passing eligibility data to the Plan in a timely manner . If the Group does not provide the Plan with timely enrollment and termination information, the Plan is not responsible for the payment of Covered Services for Members.
