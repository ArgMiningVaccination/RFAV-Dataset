A friend of mine said, \"You've been feeding people physically, now you get to feed them spiritually\", and I couldn't agree more. At this time in history, those two things go hand-in-hand. While there may be times we feel overwhelmed or fearful with the state of our world, we must always remember that God is in control. He is our source of strength and hope. But we must also do our part in making wise and healthy choices that impact our mind, body, and spirit wellness. We are hearing a lot about how to slow the spread and flatten the curve with COVID-19. And with fall and winter just around the corner, we also begin to see a rise in influenza and the common cold. Therefore, we need to take the necessary measures to improve our health and keep our immune system in tip-top shape. Our bodies are incredible beings created by God, and in the image of God. And when our bodies were created, God gave us an intricate immune system that would be needed to protect us, especially after the Fall in the Garden of Eden. Our immune system is our body's major defense fighting power against things such as viruses, bacteria, toxins, parasites, and fungus. Therefore, it is imperative that we take the necessary precautions and steps to keep our immune system healthy every day. We must choose to make healthy lifestyle choices each day by consuming nutritious foods, drinking plenty of water, exercising, and getting proper amounts of sleep to keep our immune system strong and ready to take on any illness that comes our way. However, our American diet often is deficient in the proper nutrition that we need. Our foods are sometimes over processed with many additives and preservatives. We get caught up in the rat race of life with busy schedules and will incorporate more \"fast foods\" into our diet that can have negative effects on our health. We settle for convenience rather than taking the time to prepare healthy food options. And when we choose to do these things, our health begins to suffer, and our immune system is not at the level of fighting power that it should be. When this happens, we may need to look at supplementing our diet with vitamins and minerals. Research has shown that supplements can improve our immune system response and help fight against illness. But it is also important that you discuss supplementation with your physician before starting it. Why? Because some supplements, including herbal supplements, can interact with both over-the-counter and prescription medications. In addition, some supplements can have an adverse effect for people with certain health conditions. So, how do we strengthen our immune system? Here's my top ten to get you started. Incorporate God's Word into your day and allow Him to speak into your life. Pray - turn your worries and concerns over to Him. Never forget that He is with you always. Set a goal for 7-10 hours of sleep per night. Drink plenty of water - again this is different for everyone, especially if you are on a fluid restriction. But, a good rule of thumb is (8)-8 oz glasses per day (64 oz). Set a goal for 30 minutes of exercise 3-5 times per week. Choose fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables over canned. Eat a variety of colors each day - the more colorful your plate of fruits and veggies the better. Choose 100% whole wheat breads and pastas over enriched white/bleached. Limit fast food and over processed foods. Also, limit your sugar intake. Instead, try to eat whole foods that are fresh. Consider a multivitamin/mineral supplement. Some key nutrients that you may be lacking, but are essential for boosting your immune system are: Zinc, Vitamin D3 and Vitamin C. Always discuss your health and nutrition with your physician and/or a registered dietitian. Take the time to get your immune system healthy and in top fighting shape. Your body is the temple of the Living God. It is your responsibility to honor Him by taking care of it. "}
