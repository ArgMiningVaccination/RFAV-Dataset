Chosen, $15.99 ISBN 978-0-8007-9787-4 Smith (Seeing the Voice of God) aims to help the reader renew lost Christian faith by putting \"doubt on a diet\" through a month-long regimented cleansing and meditation program with a daily three-prong approach: Scripture-based discussions of the troubling challenges in our daily lives that can erode faith, partnered with specific prayer suggestions directed at finding hope and comfort in the midst of difficult emotions, and a juice fast focusing on detoxifying each of the major systems of the body over two days by choosing different colors of fruits and vegetables. She includes five categories of possible \"faith toxins,\" which she explores for six days each: social influence, finance, health, relationships, and purpose and identity. Smith's nutritional credentials are minimal, but her recipes are simple and easy to follow, and she has an original approach to tough topics; her warm sincerity as a spiritual guide comes through in her writing. This is a highly guided renewal program that addresses mind, body, and spirit. (Jan.) Details Reviewed on: 10/12/2015 Genre: Religion "}
